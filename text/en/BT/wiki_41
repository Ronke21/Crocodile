<text>Be Here Now is the third studio album by the English rock band Oasis, released on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. The album was recorded at multiple recording studios in London, including Abbey Road Studios, as well as Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey. Although most tracks retain the anthemic quality of previous releases, the songs on &quot;Be Here Now&quot; are longer and contain many guitar overdubs. Noel Gallagher said this was done to make the album sound as &quot;colossal&quot; as possible. The album cover features a shot of the band members at Stocks House in Hertfordshire. It is the last Oasis studio album to feature founding members guitarist Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs and bassist Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan as the two left in 1999.

Following the worldwide success of their first two albums, &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; (1994) and &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (1995), the album was highly anticipated. Oasis&#x27; management company, Ignition, were aware of the dangers of overexposure, and before release sought to control media access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign gag orders. The tactics alienated the press and many industry personnel connected with the band and fuelled large-scale speculation and publicity within the British music scene.

Preceded by the lead single &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot;, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; was an instant commercial success, becoming the fastest-selling album in British chart history and topping the albums chart in 15 countries. It was the biggest selling album of 1997 in the UK, with 1.47 million units sold that year. As of 2016, the album has sold eight million copies worldwide. It has been certified 6× Platinum in the UK and Platinum in the US, being Oasis&#x27; third and final Platinum album in the latter country.

According to co-producer Owen Morris, the recording sessions were marred by arguments and drug abuse, and the band&#x27;s only motivations were commercial. While initial reception for &quot;Be Here Now&quot; was positive, retrospective reviews have been more negative, with many calling it bloated and over-produced. The band members have had differing views of the album: Noel has severely criticised it, while Liam Gallagher has praised it, calling the album his favourite Oasis album. Music journalists such as Jon Savage and Miranda Sawyer have pinpointed the album&#x27;s release as marking the end of the Britpop movement. In 2016, the album was reissued with bonus tracks, including a new remix of &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot;

==Background==
By the summer of 1996, Oasis were widely considered, according to guitarist Noel Gallagher, &quot;the biggest band in the world ... bigger than, dare I say it, fucking God.&quot; The commercial success of their previous two albums had resulted in media frenzy in danger of leading to a backlash.

Earlier that year, Oasis members holidayed with Johnny Depp and Kate Moss in Mick Jagger&#x27;s villa in Mustique. During their last stay on the island, Noel wrote the majority of the songs that would make up &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. He had suffered from writer&#x27;s block during the previous winter, and said he wrote only a single guitar riff in the six months following the release of &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;. Eventually, he disciplined himself to a routine of songwriting where he would go &quot;into this room in the morning, come out for lunch, go back in, come out for dinner, go back in, then go to bed.&quot; Noel said &quot;most of the songs were written before I even got a record deal, I went away and wrote the lyrics in about two weeks.&quot; Oasis producer Owen Morris joined Gallagher later with a TASCAM 8-track recorder, and they recorded demos with a drum machine and a keyboard.
In August 1996, Oasis performed two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire; more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates were to be the zenith of Oasis&#x27;s popularity, and both the music press and the band realised it would not be possible for the band to equal the event. By this time, infighting had broken out in the band. On 23 August 1996, vocalist Liam Gallagher refused to sing for an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall, pleading a sore throat. He attended the concert and heckled Noel from the upper balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then-girlfriend Patsy Kensit. He rejoined the band a few days after for a key concert at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance.

Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Noel finally lost his patience with Liam and announced he was leaving the band. He said later: &quot;If the truth be known, I didn&#x27;t want to be there anyway. I wasn&#x27;t prepared to be in the band if people were being like that to each other.&quot; Noel rejoined Oasis a few weeks later, but the band&#x27;s management and handlers were worried. With an album&#x27;s worth of songs already demoed, the Gallaghers felt that they should record as soon as possible. Their manager, Marcus Russell, said in 2007 that &quot;in retrospect, we went in the studio too quickly. The smart move would have been to take the rest of the year off. But at the time it seemed like the right thing to do. If you&#x27;re a band and you&#x27;ve got a dozen songs you think are great, why not go and do it.&quot;

In 2006, Noel agreed that the band should have separated for a year or two instead of going into the studio. However, Morris later wrote: &quot;It was a mistake on everyone&#x27;s part, management very much included, that we didn&#x27;t record &quot;Be Here Now&quot; in the summer of 1996. It would have been a much different album: happy probably.&quot; He described the Mustique demos as &quot;the last good recordings I did with Noel&quot;, and said his relationship soured following the Knebworth concert.

==Recording and production==

Recording began on 7 October 1996 at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios in London. Morris described the first week as &quot;fucking awful&quot;, and suggested to Noel that they abandon the session: &quot;He just shrugged and said it would be all right. So on we went.&quot; Liam was under heavy tabloid focus at the time, and on 9 November 1996 was arrested and cautioned for cocaine possession at the &quot;Q&quot; Awards. A media frenzy ensued, and the band&#x27;s management made the decision to move to a studio less readily accessible to paparazzi. &quot;Sun&quot; showbiz editor Dominic Mohan recalled: &quot;We had quite a few Oasis contacts on the payroll. I don&#x27;t know whether any were drug dealers, but there was always a few dodgy characters about.&quot;

Oasis&#x27;s official photographer Jill Furmanovsky felt the media&#x27;s focus, and was preyed upon by tabloid journalists living in the flat upstairs from her: &quot;They thought I had the band hiding in my flat.&quot; In paranoia, Oasis cut themselves off from their wider circle. According to Johnny Hopkins, the publicist of Oasis&#x27;s label Creation Records, &quot;People were being edged out of the circle around Oasis. People who knew them before they were famous rather than because they were famous.&quot; Hopkins likened the situation to a medieval court, complete with kings, courtiers, and jesters, and said: &quot;Once you&#x27;re in that situation you lose sight of reality.&quot;

On 11 November 1996, Oasis relocated to the rural Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey. Though they reconvened with more energy, the early recordings were compromised by the drug intake of all involved. Morris recalled that &quot;in the first week, someone tried to score an ounce of weed, but instead got an ounce of cocaine. Which kind of summed it up.&quot; Noel was not present during any of Liam&#x27;s vocal track recordings. Morris thought that the new material was weak, but when he voiced his opinion to Noel he was cut down: &quot;[So] I just carried on shovelling drugs up my nose.&quot; Morris had initially wanted to just transfer the Mustique demo recordings and overdub drums, vocals, and rhythm guitar, but the 8-track mixer he had employed required him to bounce tracks for overdubs, leaving him unable to remove the drum machine from the recordings.

Noel, wanting to make the album as dense and &quot;colossal&quot; feeling as possible, layered multiple guitar tracks on several songs. In many instances he dubbed ten channels with identical guitar parts, in an effort to create a sonic volume. Creation&#x27;s owner Alan McGee visited the studio during the mixing stage; he said, &quot;I used to go down to the studio, and there was so much cocaine getting done at that point ... Owen was out of control, and he was the one in charge of it. The music was just &quot;fucking loud&quot;.&quot; Morris responded: &quot;Alan McGee was the head of the record company. Why didn&#x27;t he do something about the &#x27;out of control&#x27; record producer? Obviously, the one not in control was the head of the record company.&quot; He said that he and the band had been dealing with personal difficulties the day and night before McGee visited the studio.

==Songs==
As with Oasis&#x27; previous two albums, the songs on &quot;Be Here Now&quot; are generally anthemic. The structures are traditional, and largely follow the typical verse – chorus – verse – chorus – middle eight – chorus format of guitar-based rock music. Reviewing for &quot;Nude as the News&quot;, Jonathan Cohen noted that the album is &quot;virtually interchangeable with 1994&#x27;s &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; or its blockbuster sequel, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;&quot;, while Noel had previously remarked that he would make three albums in this generic style. Yet the songs on &quot;Be Here Now&quot; differ in that they are longer than previous releases; an extended coda brings &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; to almost eight minutes, while &quot;All Around the World&quot; contains three key changes and lasts for a full nine minutes. When &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single, Noel Gallagher expected to be asked to reduce the length of the song by two minutes. However, nobody had the courage.

The tracks are more layered and intricate than before, and each contains multiple guitar overdubs. While Morris had previously stripped away layers of overdubs on the band&#x27;s debut &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, during the production of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; he &quot;seemed to gleefully encourage&quot; such excess; &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; has an estimated thirty tracks of guitar overdubbed onto the song. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review described the guitar lines as composed of &quot;elementary riffs&quot;.

There was some experimentation: &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; contains a slowed down loop from N.W.A&#x27;s &quot;Straight Outta Compton&quot;, while &quot;Magic Pie&quot; features psychedelically arranged vocal harmonies and a Mellotron. According to Noel, &quot;All I did was run my elbows across the keys and this mad jazz came out and everyone laughed.&quot; The album&#x27;s production is dominated by top-end high frequency tones, and according to &quot;Uncut&quot;″s Paul Lester, its use of treble is reminiscent of both late 1980s Creation Records bands such as My Bloody Valentine, and the Stooges&#x27; famously under-produced &quot;Raw Power&quot; (1973).

The vocal melodies continue Noel&#x27;s preference for &quot;massed-rank sing-alongs&quot;, although Paul Du Noyer concedes that not all are of the &quot;pub-trashing idiot kind&quot; of previous releases. At the time of release, &quot;Q&quot;″s Phil Sutcliffe summarised the lyrics of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; as a mixture of &quot;hookline optimism, a swarm of Beatles and other &#x27;60s references, a gruff love song to Meg, and further tangled expressions of his inability/unwillingness to express profound emotions.&quot; David Fricke found the numerous Beatles references, including the line &quot;The Fool on the Hill and I Feel Fine&quot; from &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; and &quot;Sing a song for me, one from &quot;Let It Be&quot;&quot; on the title track as lazy songwriting from Noel. Reviewers have also found Beatles references in the music, on tracks such as &quot;All Around the World&quot;, which has been compared to the sing-along qualities of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.

The lyrics were elsewhere described as &quot;[running] the gamut from insightful to insipid&quot;, although Du Noyer admitted that Noel is &quot;[to go by his lyrics] something of a closet philosopher ... and often romantic to the point of big girl&#x27;s blousedom.&quot; While the tracks &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot; and &quot;The Girl in the Dirty Shirt&quot; were described as unabashedly sentimental, Du Noyer went on to observe that &quot;there is compassion and sensitivity in these tracks that is not the work of oafs.&quot; Du Noyer conceded that Noel often tied himself up in &quot;cosmic knots&quot;, but had &quot;written words that sound simple and true, and are therefore poetic without trying to be.&quot; Lester read song titles such as &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot; as a series of demands, both to members of his private life and his public audience.

Du Noyer praised Liam&#x27;s vocal contributions and described his &quot;Northern punk whine&quot; as &quot;the most distinctive individual style of our time.&quot; Lester alluded to Liam as Noel&#x27;s &quot;mouthpiece&quot;, although he qualified that Liam is the &quot;voice of every working-class boy with half a yen to break out and make it big.&quot;

==Album cover==

The cover image was shot in April 1997 at Stocks House in Hertfordshire, the former home of Victor Lownes, head of the Playboy Clubs in the UK until 1981. It shows the band standing by the swimming pool outside the hotel, surrounded by various props. For the photo shoot, a white 1972 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow was lowered into the swimming pool and half submerged in the water.

Photographer Michael Spencer Jones said the original concept involved shooting each band member in various locations around the world, but when the cost proved prohibitive, the shoot was relocated to Stocks House. Spencer remarked that the shoot &quot;degenerated into chaos&quot;, adding that &quot;by 8 pm, everyone was in the bar, there were schoolkids all over the set, and the lighting crew couldn&#x27;t start the generator. It was &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; meets &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.&quot; Critics have tried to read into the selection of the cover props, but Johns said Gallagher simply selected items from the BBC props store he thought would look good in the picture. Two props considered were an inflatable globe (intended as a homage to the sleeve of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;) and the Rolls-Royce, suggested by Arthurs.

Jones has said that the partially submerged Rolls-Royce was in reference to Keith Moon&#x27;s oft-fabled sinking of a Lincoln Continental into a hotel swimming pool in 1967. The release date in each region was commemorated on the calendar pictured on the sleeve; Harris said the dating &quot;[encouraged] fans to believe that to buy a copy on the day it appeared was to participate in some kind of historical event.&quot; The album cover also spurred controversy from a legal viewpoint. In the case of &quot;Creation Records Ltd v. News Group Newspapers Ltd&quot;, the court decided that the collection of objects brought together for the album cover was insufficient in creating an artwork that could be protected by copyright.

==Release==
===Promotion===
When Alan McGee, Creation&#x27;s publicist Johnny Hopkins, and marketing executive Emma Greengrass first heard &quot;Be Here Now&quot; at Noel Gallagher&#x27;s house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled &quot;a lot of nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs.&quot; McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: &quot;I heard it in the studio and I remember saying &#x27;We&#x27;ll only sell seven million copies&#x27; ... I thought it was too confrontational.&quot; However, in an interview with the music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee&#x27;s hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition&#x27;s strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information from anybody not directly involved with the album&#x27;s release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a &quot;regular, everyday collection of tunes.&quot; To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass &quot;We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing.&quot;

However, the extent that Ignition were willing to go to control access to the album generated more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: &quot;we&#x27;d been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. &#x27;Shit, it&#x27;s a nightmare&#x27;.&quot; BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album&#x27;s release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he received a phone call from Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn&#x27;t speak enough over the songs. Lamacq said, &quot;I had to go on the air the next night and say, &#x27;Sorry, but we&#x27;re not getting any more tracks.&#x27; It was just &quot;absurd.&quot;&quot; According to Creation&#x27;s head of marketing John Andrews, &quot;[The campaign] made people despise Oasis within Creation. You had this Oasis camp that was like &#x27;I&#x27;m sorry, you&#x27;re not allowed come into the office between the following hours. You&#x27;re not allowed mention the word Oasis.&#x27; It was like a fascist state.&quot; One employee recalled an incident &quot;when somebody came round to check our phones because they thought &quot;The Sun&quot; had tapped them.&quot;

When Hopkins began to circulate cassette copies of the album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to &quot;Select&quot; journalist Mark Perry, &quot;not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don&#x27;t talk to your girlfriend about it when you&#x27;re at home in bed.&quot; Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: &quot;In retrospect a lot of the things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [Oasis] meetings today and we&#x27;re like &#x27;It&#x27;s on the Internet. It&#x27;s in Camden Market. Whatever&#x27;. I think we&#x27;ve learned our lesson.&quot; According to Perry: &quot;It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to &quot;All Around the World&quot; and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here.&quot;

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Be Here Now&quot; was released in the UK on 21 August 1997. The release date had been brought forward out of Ignition&#x27;s fear that import copies of the album from the United States would arrive in Britain before the street date. Worrying that TV news cameras would interview queuing fans at a traditional midnight opening session, Ignition forced retailers to sign contracts pledging not to sell the record earlier than 8:00 am. However, the cameras arrived regardless, just in time to record the initially slow trade. It was not until lunch time that sales picked up. By the end of the first day of release, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; sold over 424,000 units and by the end of business on Saturday that week sales had reached 663,389, making it based on first seven days sales, the fastest-selling album in British history. The album became their highest-charting release in the US by debuting at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. However, its first week sales of 152,000—below expected sales of 400,000 copies—were considered a disappointment. It missed the top of the chart by sales of only 771 copies.

&quot;Be Here Now&quot; was the biggest selling album of 1997 in the UK, with 1.47 million units sold that year. By the end of 1997, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; had sold eight million units worldwide. However, most sales came from the first two weeks of release, and once the album was released to UK radio stations the turnover tapered off. Buyers realised that the album was not another &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, and by 1999, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reported that it was the album most sold to second-hand record stores. It has been certified 7× Platinum in the UK and Platinum in the US, being Oasis&#x27; third and final Platinum album in the country. As of 2016, the album had sold over eight million copies worldwide. Four of the album&#x27;s 12 tracks were released as singles: &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot;, &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, &quot;All Around the World&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot;. In 2016, following the album&#x27;s reissue and the release of the documentary &quot;&quot;, the album topped the UK Vinyl Albums Chart, 19 years after its original release.

==Critical reception==
===Initial response===
Initial reviews of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; were, in John Harris&#x27;s words, unanimous with &quot;truly amazing praise&quot;. According to Harris, &quot;To find an album that had attracted gushing notices in such profusion, one had to go back thirty years, to the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.&quot; While &quot;Q&quot; described the album as &quot;cocaine set to music&quot;, most early reviews praised the record&#x27;s length, volume and ambition, including Charles Shaar Murray, who called it the &quot;Oasis World Domination Album&quot; in &quot;Mojo&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; complimented the song formula throughout the album, writing that it &quot;pays off&quot;. However, as a whole, he felt the album was &quot;music built for impact, not explanation&quot;. Dele Fadele of &quot;Vox&quot; describes it as &quot;a veritable rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll monsoon of an album; a giant jigsaw puzzle, an elemental force, a monster that cannot and will not be contained.&quot;

Reviews in the British music press for &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; had been generally negative. When it went on to become, in the words of &quot;Select&quot; editor Alexis Petridis, &quot;this huge kind of zeitgeist-defining record&quot;, the music press was &quot;baffled&quot;. Petridis believed the initial glowing reviews of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; were a concession to public opinion. In America, reviews were equally positive. Reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; on release, Jae-Ha Kim considered the album as good as its two predecessors, writing: &quot;The 12 tracks on &quot;Be Here Now&quot; aren&#x27;t as immediately accessible as Oasis&#x27; earlier hits &quot;Wonderwall&quot; or &quot;Live Forever&quot;. But the pop songs are mesmerising in their intense delivery and clean execution.&quot; Elysa Gardner offered similar in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, finding that with &quot;Be Here Now&quot;, the band grew more ambitious and succeeded without losing ground, although Gardner noted the &quot;taut pop craftsmanship&quot; that distinguished the band&#x27;s two predecessors was &quot;less prominent&quot;.

Nevertheless, the album did receive some mixed reviews on release. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, David Browne stated: &quot;Much of the album is a messy, mucky keg o&#x27; sound that constantly threatens to spill over and drown Noel&#x27;s innately melodic songs.&quot; He further criticised the overtly-cluttered mix and overlong songs. Nevertheless, he concluded: &quot;They sound more ferocious and confident than ever, yet less intimate, more distanced.&quot; Similarly, Simon Williams called it &quot;one of the daftest records ever made&quot; in &quot;NME&quot;. Likewise, Chris Norris criticised the lyrical content in &quot;Spin&quot; magazine, calling most of the lyrics on the record &quot;meaningless&quot;. Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; favourably compared the record to its two predecessors, finding that instead of &quot;unforgettable three- to- four minute pop slices&quot;, there are now &quot;six- to- ten minute long epics.&quot; &quot;Be Here Now&quot; proved divisive among &quot;Planet Sound&quot; readers, who voted the album their &quot;most loathed&quot; of 1997, as well as their second-favourite of the year, behind Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

===Retrospective appraisal===

Retrospectively, reception to &quot;Be Here Now&quot; has been more negative, with critics calling it bloated and over-produced. Reviewing in 2002, Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that although there were good tracks present, naming &quot;My Big Mouth&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot; and &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, the majority suffered from &quot;cumbersome overlength&quot;, feeling that the band&#x27;s attempt to make a &quot;grand, career-defining statement&quot; backfired. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield described the record as &quot;a concept album about how long all the songs were&quot;, comparing it to Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot; (1975). Although he offered praise to the title track and &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Better (Man!!)&quot;, he considered the album to be the work of a songwriter who has &quot;turn[ed] his brain [in]to cocaine crispies&quot;. In a more positive review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic calls &quot;Be Here Now&quot; a &quot;triumphant&quot; record that &quot;steamrolls over any criticism&quot;, praising Liam&#x27;s vocal performances as his finest up to that point, as well as the songs as &quot;intensely enjoyable&quot; and &quot;impossibly catchy&quot;. However, he felt that Noel&#x27;s songwriting wasn&#x27;t innovative compared to its predecessors.

The album&#x27;s 2016 reissue attracted a number of reviews, with most continuing to criticise the album&#x27;s production and song lengths. Laura Snapes of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described &quot;Be Here Now&quot; as being &quot;one of the most agonizing listening experiences in pop music&quot;, amplified by its &quot;bloated and indulgent&quot; remaster. Snapes further panned Noel&#x27;s decision to only remix &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot;, concluding that &quot;this turgid collection is the ultimate expression of &quot;Be Here Now&quot;: as bloated and indulgent as the record itself, the music a secondary concern to the product&#x27;s status&quot;.

Andrzej Lukowski of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; felt that when compared to the band&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Be Here Now&quot; lacked &quot;aspirational rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll swagger&quot; besides a few tracks; he also agreed that a complete remix of the album would have been beneficial, considering &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; needed it &quot;the least&quot;. In &quot;Clash&quot; magazine, Clarke Geddes was more positive, agreeing that although the album was bloated and over-produced, it still offered highlights, naming &quot;I Hope, I Think, I Know&quot;. He also positively appraised the bonus tracks in the box set, believing fans will be satisfied with the extra material.

However, in contrast to its later negative reception, Angus Batey of &quot;The Quietus&quot; offered a highly positive reappraisal of &quot;Be Here Now&quot; upon its 2016 reissue, calling it &quot;the best Oasis album&quot;; he praised the album&#x27;s lyricism as deeper and superior to its predecessors while arguing that its backlash reflected &quot;a record that too accurately reflect[ed] the underlying chaos and instability of the era it was made in&quot;. In 2020, Luke Holland of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described &quot;Be Here Now&quot; as a &quot;flawed masterpiece&quot;; writing that &quot;as a snapshot of 90s excess – a bygone age of pig-headed rock-star bravado – it’s a preposterous hoot.&quot;

==Legacy==

In the 2003 John Dower-directed documentary &quot;Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop&quot;, music critic Jon Savage pinpointed &quot;Be Here Now&quot; as the moment where the Britpop movement ended. Savage said that while the album &quot;isn&#x27;t the great disaster that everybody says&quot;, he noted that &quot;[i]t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record&quot; of the period. &quot;Q&quot; expressed similar sentiments, writing, &quot;So colossally did &quot;Be Here Now&quot; fall short of expectations that it killed Britpop and ushered in an era of more ambitious, less overblown music.&quot; &quot;Irish Times&quot; journalist Brian Boyd wrote: &quot;Bloated and over-heated (much like the band themselves at the time), the album has all that dreadful braggadocio that is so characteristic of a cocaine user.&quot; Reflecting in 2007, Garry Mulholland said: &quot;The fact that nothing could have lived up to the fevered expectations that surrounded its release doesn&#x27;t change the facts. The third Oasis album is a loud, lumbering noise signifying nothing.&quot; When reviewing in 2016, Lukowski wrote that although Oasis as a &quot;band&quot; would continue, Oasis as a &quot;legend&quot; died with &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. He further states that while other Britpop bands such as Pulp and Blur moved on from the Britpop-era success, Oasis continued attempting to revisit the success of their first two albums.

The Gallagher brothers hold differing opinions about the album. In July 1997, Noel was describing the production as &quot;bland&quot; and some tracks as &quot;fucking shit&quot;. He later said: &quot;Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn&#x27;t mean to say you&#x27;re any good. Look at Phil Collins.&quot; In &quot;Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop&quot;, he dismissed the album, and said that drugs and the band&#x27;s indifference during recording led to the album having faults. In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that &quot;at that time we thought it was fucking great, and I still think it&#x27;s great. It just wasn&#x27;t &quot;Morning Glory&quot;.&quot; In 2006, Liam said of Noel, &quot;If he didn&#x27;t like the record that much, he shouldn&#x27;t have put the fucking record out in the first place ... I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with him but it&#x27;s a top record, man, and I&#x27;m proud of it—it&#x27;s just a little bit long.&quot; In 2018, the BBC included it in their list of &quot;the acclaimed albums that nobody listens to any more.&quot; Noel has observed that many Oasis fans still hold the album in high regard, as do prominent musicians such as Marilyn Manson. In 2017, Liam ranked the album as his favourite release by Oasis.

The album was reissued in several limited-edition formats, including silver-coloured double heavyweight vinyl, a double picture disc and cassette, on 19August 2022 to celebrate its 25th anniversary. The reissue was promoted with new lyric videos for &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean? (NG&#x27;s 2016 Rethink)&quot; and &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

==Track listing==

As part of a promotional campaign entitled Chasing the Sun, the album was re-released on 14 October 2016.

Bonus content includes demos, the Mustique sessions, live tracks, and a 2016 remix of &quot;D&#x27;You Know What I Mean?&quot; Noel Gallagher was supposed to remix the entire album but later decided against it.

<text>Dadar () is a densely populated residential and shopping neighbourhood in Mumbai. It is also a prominent railway and bus service hub with local and national connectivity. It is Mumbai’s first planned area and it is a hub for the city&#x27;s Marathi culture.

==History==
===Origins===
In the 16th century, the area was known as lower Mahim as it was located on the island of Mahim, one of the Seven islands of Mumbai which, after the Bombay Island, was the most important during the whole of the Portuguese period. The Portuguese Franciscans built a church here in 1596 called &quot;Nossa Senhora de Salvação&quot;, which is popularly known today as Portuguese Church and is a familiar Dadar landmark.

===19th and 20th century ===
The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme of 1899-1900 was the first planned scheme in Mumbai. The Bombay Improvement Trust devised the plan to relieve congestion in the centre of the town following the plague epidemics of the 1890s. According to the survey plan, 60,000 people were to be housed at Dadar-Matunga and an equal number in Sion-Matunga. 85,000 people were to be accommodated in the developments in Sewri-Wadala.

Among the institutions moved to Dadar under the City Improvement Trust (CIT) plan were Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute, now known as Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute and King George school, now known as IES&#x27; Raja Shivaji Vidyalaya (now a collection of several schools). The plan regulated constructions and restricted building construction to three storey high with open space between them.

Ramnarain Ruia College in 1937 and Ramniranjan Podar College was founded in 1939, completing Dadar’s transition from a residential area to a more diverse neighborhood. Both colleges are run by SP Mandali. Dr. Antonio Da Silva High School, founded in 1851 during the British India period, and one of Mumbai’s oldest schools, is located here.

During the cotton mill era of Mumbai, some key mills like Bombay Dyeing (Spring Mills), Gold Mohur Mills, Kohinoor Mills, Ruby Mills and Tata Mills were located in Dadar. During the redevelopment of Mumbai mills some of these were redeveloped or went defunct.

By 1937 Shivaji Park and the surrounding areas were developed. The public space was to become an important stage in the political drama leading up to India&#x27;s independence. Later political history in Mumbai also unfolded in this park.

The Sharadashram society as well as a school built in 1948-50 are the biggest landmarks of Dadar. Sharadashram society is Asia&#x27;s first registered society as well as first society in Mumbai.

During the 1993 Bombay bombings, a defused bomb was discovered in Dadar by Dr. JK Mandot who also provided the Mumbai police their first clue in the 1993 blasts probe, when on 13 March 1993, he alerted them about a dubious-looking Bajaj Chetak scooter (MH-04-Z-261) parked outside his dispensary on Naigaum Cross Road. The scooter, laden with RDX, had failed to explode, and was defused after Mandot&#x27;s call to the police control room.

===21st century ===
Dadar has growing importance in the present day because of its railway routes. The old chawls are giving way to new high-rise buildings, thus changing the neighbourhood&#x27;s skyline. The Khodadad circle and its surrounding buildings are a heritage site of Grade IIB.

==Neighbourhoods==
* Shivaji Park
* Worli - Bandra Sea link view
* Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Memorial (Chaitya Bhoomi)
* Dadar is also home to the Mumbai Mayor&#x27;s Bungalow, the official residence of the Mayor of Mumbai.

==Transportation==
===Rail===

Dadar is a prominent railway terminus on both the Western and Central lines of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. Being the only common railway station to both the Central and Western lines, it makes a transit point for many passengers traveling through Suburban Railway.

===Road===
Dadar east has been a key interchange point for those coming from Pune, Panvel and Navi Mumbai by road transport. A bus hub next to Dadar GPO is a destination point for many buses coming from out of Mumbai.

Locally, Dadar is well connected to other neighborhoods of Mumbai, namely Matunga, Wadala, Parel-Prabhadevi, and Mahim.

=== Metro ===

Dadar West will be served by the underground Line 3 of Mumbai Metro.

==Culture==

Dadar has long been a cultural center for the native Marathi speaking local people and from the rest of Maharashtra. Being along the Konkan coast, like the rest of Mumbai, the native language of the region is Marathi.

===Cinema===
Dada Saheb Phalke (in recognition of whom the road Dada Saheb Phalke Road is named) partly shot his first film &quot;Raja Harishchandra&quot; at Mathura Bhavan, in one of his friend&#x27;s residence in Dadar East. Apart from this studio, many other prominent film studios such as Ranjit Studios and Rooptara Studios were eventually built on this road.

There is also an active crowd that watches dramas and Shivaji Mandir is one of the few theatres in Mumbai that has catered to the middle class&#x27; interest in the dramatic arts. It was here that artists like Vijay Tendulkar, Vijaya Mehta, Mahesh Elkunchwar, Dr. Shreeram Lagoo and Nana Patekar found an eager audience.

Dadar has been also home to movie halls like Chitra Cinema, Inox Nakshatra and Hindmata Cinema. Plaza Cinema, a prominent theatre in west Dadar was damaged during the 1993 bomb-blasts/riots. It has now reopened and remains one of the theatres in Mumbai that show Marathi movies.

===Restaurants and cuisine===
Vada Pav was invented outside Dadar Station in 1971, by Ashok Vaidya using the Pav (Portuguese word for bread). Apart from Vada Pav, Dadar is also popular for traditional Maharashtrian food like Batata Vada, Thalipith, Sabudana Vada, Misal Pav, Pav, Puri Bhaji, Pithla Bhakri, Piyush (a sweet drink) and Lassi. There are many restaurants like Prakash Hotel, Aaswad Hotel, Gypsy, Sindhudurg Hotel, Gomantak Hotel and Panshikar that serve Marathi food. Restaurants catering to Udupi, Panjabi and north Indian, Chinese, Thai and many other cuisines dot the landscape.

===Park and gardens===

<text>The Yellowjacks were a Royal Air Force aerobatic display team which flew Folland Gnat trainers painted yellow. The team was formed in May 1964 by a group of flying instructors, led by Flight Lieutenant Lee Jones, at No 4 Flying Training School at RAF Valley. The two-seat Gnat T.1 had been in service at Valley only since November 1962, when the first 20 student pilots, selected after being awarded their &quot;wings&quot;, from the recently graduated No 82 Entry of the RAF College Cranwell, had started their advanced training on the Gnat. Instructors and student pilots loved this aircraft, because of its small size and its sensitive handling and high maneuverability.

The name adopted by the team (derived from the team leader&#x27;s call-sign) was disapproved of by higher authority, who recognised the concept of a Gnat aerobatic team as attractive, but felt the name and the yellow colour of the aircraft wrong. (The name &quot;Daffodil Patrol&quot; was once believed to have been suggested). It was also thought that the team had maverick instincts, and needed to be brought into the mainstream so the team was officially reformed, in November 1964, as The Red Arrows. The Red Arrows continued flying the Gnat until 1979 when it was superseded by the British Aerospace Hawk for the 1980 season.

<doc id="570315" wikidata="Q154575" url="?curid=570315" title="Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest">
<text>Germany has officially participated in every Eurovision Song Contest since its inaugural edition in , except in when its entry did not qualify past the audio-only pre-selection round, and consequently was not seen in the broadcast final and does not count as one of Germany&#x27;s 67 appearances. No other country has been represented as many times. Along with , , , and the , Germany is one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; countries that are automatically prequalified for the final, due to their participant broadcasters being the largest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). The final is broadcast in Germany on ARD&#x27;s flagship channel, .

Germany first won the contest in with &quot;Ein bißchen Frieden&quot; performed by Nicole. The second German victory came 28 years later at the contest, when &quot;Satellite&quot; performed by Lena won. Katja Ebstein, who finished third in and , then second in , is the only performer to have made the top three on three occasions. Germany has a total of 11 top three placements, also finishing second with Lena Valaitis () and twice with the group Wind (1985 and 1987), and finishing third with Mary Roos (1972), Mekado (1994) and Sürpriz (1999). Germany has finished last on nine occasions, receiving &quot;nul points&quot; in , and .

While having not reached the top ten in 14 of the last 19 contests (2005–2024), Michael Schulte achieved Germany&#x27;s second-best result of the 21st century, by finishing fourth at the contest. Although German contestants have had varied levels of success, public interest remains high and the contest is one of the most-watched events each year.

==History==
The Federal Republic of Germany has participated in the contest since its inception in . Before German reunification in 1990, the country was occasionally presented as &quot;West Germany&quot;. The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) did not participate in the Eurovision Song Contest, and instead took part in the Intervision Song Contest. 

With one win () and four second-place results (, , , and ), Germany was the second most successful country in the contest in the 1980s, behind Ireland, who had two wins in the decade.

===1996 absence===
ARD had selected an artist and song to represent them at the , to be held in Oslo, Norway. Due to the large number of countries wanting to compete at Eurovision, the EBU determined that only 23 of the 30 countries could compete. Hosts Norway qualified automatically, the other 29 songs went into an audio-only pre-qualification round, with the top 22 going on to compete alongside Norway in Oslo. Unfortunately for Germany, its entry, Leon with &quot;Planet of Blue&quot;, failed to earn enough points to progress to the final, finishing 24th. ARD and the EBU were not happy with this, as Germany was the biggest financial contributor at the time. This is the only time that Germany has been absent from the contest.

===2000s===
In the 2000s, Germany has been notable for their adoption of musical styles which are not typical of Eurovision, such as country and western (Texas Lightning – &quot;No No Never&quot; in ) and swing (Roger Cicero – &quot;&quot; in and Alex Swings Oscar Sings – &quot;Miss Kiss Kiss Bang&quot; in ). Germany had some successes throughout the decade, Lou - &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Happy&quot; came in 11th place out of 26 in and Stefan Raab came 5th in 2000, which was Germany&#x27;s best placement during the 2000&#x27;s. Germany tied for last in for points, but was awarded 23rd of 25 places when the results were posted. In 2009, ARD held an internal selection for the first time since 1995 due to lack of interest and viewing figures of the German national finals. Alex Christensen and Oscar Loya were selected to represent Germany at the 2009 contest, where they performed on stage with burlesque artist Dita Von Teese. However they only managed to receive 35 points, placing 20th of 25 competing countries.

===2010s===
In , ARD approached former entrant and songwriter Stefan Raab and private network ProSieben to co-operate in finding a winning entry for the country. It has been said that Raab was approached due to his good record at the contest, finishing 5th in as well as writing entries in and , which finished 7th and 8th, respectively. Raab agreed and conducted a TV casting show called which was broadcast on ARD and ProSieben. A winner arose in Lena Meyer-Landrut with &quot;Satellite&quot;, who went on to win the contest. Two further collaborations with ProSieben provided the second and third top ten result in a row respectively in (Lena, who returned to defend her title with &quot;Taken by a Stranger&quot;) and (Roman Lob with &quot;Standing Still&quot;).

The streak of top 10 finishes was broken in the contest, when Cascada&#x27;s song &quot;Glorious&quot; finished 21st with 18 points. The group Elaiza in , Ann Sophie in , Jamie-Lee in and Levina in finished in 18th, 27th (last), 26th (last) and 25th (second to last) place respectively. Ann Sophie became the country&#x27;s third entry to finish with &quot;nul points&quot;, after Nora Nova in and Ulla Wiesner in , and the first since the introduction of the current scoring system in 1975.

Germany&#x27;s luck changed in , when Michael Schulte brought them back to the top 5 for the first time since 2010 with &quot;You Let Me Walk Alone&quot;, finishing in fourth place. This is the first time since 2012 that more than one country from the &quot;Big Five&quot; has made the top ten (with Italy finishing fifth) and the second time (after 2002) that two &quot;Big Five&quot; countries have made the top five since the establishment of the rule. , the duo Sisters with the song &quot;Sister&quot; was not able to replicate the same success, receiving no points from the televote and finishing in 25th place with 24 points.

=== 2020s ===
Three further bottom five results were recorded by Germany at the start of the decade, that of Jendrik in (also receiving no points from the televote), Malik Harris in (receiving no points from the juries) and Lord of the Lost in . This streak was broken by Isaak, whose entry &quot;Always on the Run&quot; placed 12th in with 117 points.

==Organisation==
Since 1996, ARD consortium member (NDR) is who participates in the contest representing Germany. (SWR) will take over from NDR as lead broadcaster from . The responsibility within the consortium for the participation in the contest has changed hands between its different members over the years:

* Nord-und Westdeutscher Rundfunkverband (NWRV)1956
* (HR)1957, 1959–1961, 1963–1964, 1966–1971, 1973–1977
* (WDR)1958
* (SWF)1962, 1978
* (NDR)1965, 1996–2025
* (SFB)1972, 1991
* (BR)1979–1990
* (MDR)1992–1995
* (SWR)2026

In 1991, SFB worked in partnership with the East German broadcaster Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF) to select the German entry for that year&#x27;s contest. Between 2010 and 2012, private broadcaster worked in partnership with NDR. In 2025, RTL Deutschland will partner with NDR. 

The process to select the German entry in the contest has changed over the years, with both national finals and internal selections (occasionally a combination of both formats) having been held.

== Germany and the &quot;Big Five&quot; ==
Since 1999, Germany, along with , and the , have automatically qualified for the Eurovision final regardless of their results in previous contests. The participant broadcasters from these countries earned this special status by being the four biggest financial contributors to the EBU, and subsequently became known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. In 2008, it was reported that the &quot;Big Four&quot; could lose their status and be forced to compete in the semi-finals; however, this never materialised, and the rule remained in place. When Italy returned to the contest in 2011, it was given the same status, resulting in the countries becoming members of a &quot;Big Five&quot;.

Germany was the first Big Five country to win the contest after the rule was introduced, courtesy of Lena in . In terms of success, it is currently second behind Italy, which won in with Måneskin, and finished second in with Raphael Gualazzi and again in with Mahmood. However, taking into account Italy&#x27;s absence from the contest for the first 11 years of the rule&#x27;s existence, Germany remains the only country to have won out of the original &quot;Big Four&quot;.

===Commentators and spokespersons===
Over the years, commentary on ARD has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including Ado Schlier, Thomas Gottschalk, Jan Hofer, Wolf Mittler, Fritz Egner and Werner Veigel. Peter Urban has provided commentary on Das Erste every year since 1997, and has only been absent once, in 2009, when he was forced to step down due to illness, with Tim Frühling from HR filling in to commentate in Moscow. For the later-cancelled contest, Michael Schulte was set to commentate together with Urban. Both commentated the official EBU replacement show &quot;&quot; instead, as well as the German replacement show &quot;Eurovision 2020 – das deutsche Finale&quot; from the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg. Urban stepped down as the German commentator after the . His successor is Thorsten Schorn.

<text>BBC CWR (Coventry &amp; Warwickshire Radio) is the BBC&#x27;s local radio station serving Coventry and Warwickshire.

It broadcasts on FM, DAB, digital TV and via BBC Sounds from studios at Priory Place in Coventry city centre.

According to RAJAR, the station has a weekly audience of 64,000 listeners and a 3.7% share as of December 2023.

==History==
===BBC CWR launch===

In the early 1990s, BBC Local Radio underwent an expansion programme where counties and other areas without a local radio station were identified. Five stations were to launch: BBC Radio Surrey, BBC Radio Berkshire, BBC Radio Suffolk, BBC Wiltshire Sound and BBC Radio Warwickshire.

The &quot;Radio Warwickshire&quot; working title was changed to &quot;BBC CWR&quot; by the time the station launched on 17 January 1990. The name CWR &quot;(Coventry and Warwickshire Radio)&quot; reflected the wider area that the new station would cover, taking in the city of Coventry with the whole of the county of Warwickshire, which was then also served by BBC Radio WM. The station broadcast from a Victorian-style mansion on Warwick Road, close to Coventry railway station. Smaller studios were located in Atherstone, Nuneaton, Rugby, Stratford-upon-Avon, Leamington and Warwick.

===Problems and closure===
From day one, BBC CWR faced strong competition from the established commercial radio stations in the area. Mercia Sound had been an outstanding success since its own launch ten years earlier in 1980. Xtra AM, the AM-only sister station of Mercia Sound, also enjoyed high listenership since it split from Mercia and launched in 1989. Consequently CWR seemed to find it difficult to compete for the very large audiences built up by Mercia and Xtra. It was, however, well respected and highly regarded with its regular audience.

===BBC WM merger===
The BBC, under then Director-General of the BBC John Birt, deemed that CWR was not sufficiently successful in audience terms to warrant its continuation, and within increasing financial constraints in February 1995 CWR was to close. Regular listeners were hugely disappointed and phoned presenter Jon Gaunt to protest about the decision. It was ultimately decided that BBC CWR would merge with neighbouring BBC Radio WM in Birmingham, but would operate as an opt-out service from Radio WM with the remainder of the schedule as shared programming. This merger took place in May 1995. This had the effect of alienating local listeners, whilst paradoxically presenters from WM, such as Ed Doolan, Malcolm Boyden and Tony Butler received high listening figures and distinctions with three &quot;Sony Radio Academy Awards&quot;, including Radio Station of the Year in 1996.

Its studios were relocated from Warwick Road to much smaller premises on Greyfriars Road. All local programmes except breakfast with Annie Othen, the afternoon show with Bob Brolly, &quot;Poles Apart&quot; on Wednesdays, and weekend football coverage of Coventry City, were replaced with programming from Birmingham.

In 2003, the station was re-labelled as BBC WM across Coventry and Warwickshire.

===BBC Coventry and Warwickshire relaunch===
In 2003, the then Director-General of the BBC, Greg Dyke, announced on-air that Coventry and Warwickshire would again have its own BBC Local Radio station. Describing the situation with presenter Annie Othen, Dyke said that the station would be added to the BBC&#x27;s Local Radio portfolio:

I&#x27;m very pleased to announce that we&#x27;re planning to open a new radio station in Coventry – an area that&#x27;s been served by BBC WM since 1995. We hope the new station will be housed in a modern, vibrant building close to Coventry Cathedral in the heart of the city. Alongside the radio studios, there&#x27;ll also be an open centre to provide access to BBC Learning facilities similar to the already established centres in Blackburn, Sheffield and Stoke. Open Centres provide a valuable community role, so this is an exciting venture for the BBC.

He also said that the 1995 closure of CWR was a &quot;mistake&quot;:

The decision was made under different circumstances – and now we&#x27;re in a position to change it.

BBC Coventry and Warwickshire relaunched as a stand-alone station on 3 September 2005 with full local programming for 15 hours a day.

In February 2020, BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire reverted to the BBC CWR name.

==Technical==
The BBC initially supplied two powerful FM transmitters for BBC CWR to cover the whole of the county. A 2.2 kilowatt transmitter at an existing tower at Meriden provides Coventry and North Warwickshire with a good signal on 94.8 MHz, a frequency vacated by BRMB Radio in Birmingham before it moved to 96.4 MHz in 1989.

The South Warwickshire area receives a strong signal on 103.7 MHz from a 1.4 kW transmitter located at an existing television relay site on a hill at Lark Stoke, west-northwest of Shipston-on-Stour and south of Stratford-upon-Avon.

A small pocket of poor reception in Nuneaton was later resolved by adding a low power relay transmitter on 104.0 MHz.

BBC CWR went digital shortly after the launch of the local DAB multiplex on 31 January 2001 with NOW Digital Coventry in the Coventry area with transmissions from Samuel Vale House (central Coventry), Barwell Water Tower near Hinckley, Meriden and Leamington Spa.

The station also broadcasts on Freeview TV channel 711 in the BBC West Midlands region and streams online via BBC Sounds.

==Programming==
Local programming is produced and broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s Coventry studios from 6am to 2pm on Mondays to Fridays and for sports coverage.

The station usually broadcasts the whole of the Late Night programme, a programme carried by all BBC Local Radio stations (except in the case of sports coverage), which is broadcast between 10 pm and 1 am.

During the station&#x27;s downtime, BBC CWR simulcasts overnight programming from BBC Radio 5 Live.

===Sports coverage===
The station provides coverage of a range of sports, including live commentary, reports and updates. The flagship sports programme is &quot;BBC CWR Sport&quot; (also referred on air as &quot;Sky Blues Sport&quot;). It is broadcast mostly on Saturday afternoons (and occasionally on Sundays and weeknights). The mainstay of the coverage is live match commentary of Coventry City matches. Clive Eakin is the primary commentator as of 2001, and primary presenter from 2001 to 2023, with Rob Gurney rejoining the station as lead presenter in 2023. As of 2019, co-commentary is primarily provided by former City player Steve Ogrizovic, following his retirement as the club&#x27;s goalkeeper coach, with Dave Bennett being the typical stand in. Before this, Clive Eakin would be joined by various ex-players or managers for co-commentary.&quot;The Sound of the Sky Blues&quot;, a phone-in programme about Coventry City, airs on Mondays and Fridays.

After their relocation to Coventry but before their 2022 liquidation, the station provided live match commentary of Wasps RFC games (as a part of BBC Sport&#x27;s national contract with Premiership Rugby). Coventry RFC&#x27;s matches in the RFU Championship are also covered live. Alec Blackman, John Butler and Richard Moon are all involved with rugby coverage.

Online match commentary and radio reports of Leamington&#x27;s and Nuneaton Borough&#x27;s games are also provided. Commentary of Warwickshire County Cricket Club games can be found on air and online.

<text>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a 2003 romantic comedy film directed by Donald Petrie, from a script by Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, and Burr Steers, and starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey. Loosely based on the picture book of the same name by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long, the plot concerns a women&#x27;s magazine writer and an advertising executive who both begin a relationship with ulterior motives. While the story and characters in the film are original, the dating &quot;don&#x27;ts&quot; of the picture book are included in the film.

&quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on February 7, 2003, and was a box office success, grossing over $177.5 million against a production budget of $50 million. Despite this, the film garnered mixed reviews from critics, who praised Hudson and McConaughey&#x27;s acting and chemistry, but criticized the script and predictable plot.

==Plot==
Andie Anderson is a writer for the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Composure&quot; as the subject-matter expert for a series of &quot;How to&quot; articles. She is bored and wishes to write about more serious topics.

Andie&#x27;s friend Michelle experiences yet another breakup and becomes despondent, saying she is not attractive enough. Andie argues that the problem is instead her needy, excessively emotional behavior with men, and is inspired to write an article, &quot;How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days&quot;. To prove her point, she will begin dating a man and, by imitating Michelle&#x27;s behavior, provoke him to dump her within 10 days.

Advertising executive Benjamin Barry is looking to branch out from his usual remit of beer and sports campaigns by leading a prestigious ad campaign for a diamond company. At a bar, Ben&#x27;s boss, Phillip, questions whether Ben has enough insight into the romance typically associated with diamonds.

In response, Ben wagers he can make any woman fall in love with him. Phillip says that if he can achieve this before the company ball in 10 days, he will allow him to lead the diamond campaign. Ben&#x27;s rivals, Judy Spears and Judy Green, were at the &quot;Composure&quot; magazine offices earlier in the day and know about Andie&#x27;s project. Seeing Andie at the bar, they suggest her as the woman he romance, and he agrees.

Ben goes and talks to Andie and they start their relationship, neither revealing their true intentions. She works hard to get him to first fall for and then break up with her, while he sticks to his task. She makes Ben miss the final shot at a Knicks game by sending him to get her a soda, gets him punched in a movie theater by talking loudly while watching a film, moves very girly things into his apartment, gets him a fern plant to represent their love and a Chinese Crested Dog, and takes him to a Celine Dion concert instead of another Knicks game like he expected. But she also occasionally lets her normal side show, which Ben begins falling for.

Moving on, Andie behaves outrageously at Ben&#x27;s boys&#x27; poker night and drives him to break up with her. However, Ben&#x27;s friends Tony and Thayer push him to stay the course by proposing couple&#x27;s therapy with Andie, so he chases after her and she reluctantly agrees.

Andie has Michelle pose as a therapist and together they criticize Ben, who counters by offering to introduce Andie to his family in Staten Island that weekend. When they visit, she finds she likes his family, and is moved when his mother hugs her and asks her not to break Ben&#x27;s heart. Ben and Andie begin to form a genuine bond.

Andie and Ben go to the company ball together. After Phillip talks with Andie, he tells Ben that he &quot;met her, she loves you, you win&quot;. To sabotage Ben, Judy and Judy tell Tony and Thayer that Andie knew about the bet all along and was playing along to help him win.

Tony and Thayer ask Andie to keep quiet, unwittingly making her aware of the bet. Simultaneously, Andie&#x27;s boss Lana, unaware of Ben&#x27;s role, tells him about Andie&#x27;s article. Having learned of Ben&#x27;s bet, Andie attempts to humiliate Ben in front of everyone at the party, but he responds in kind and the pair argue on stage and break up.

Tony shows Andie&#x27;s subsequent article to Ben, in which she writes how she &quot;lost the only guy I&#x27;ve ever fallen for&quot;. When he goes to see her, he discovers she quit her job at &quot;Composure&quot; (because Lana again refused to let her write about serious topics) and is on her way to Washington, D.C., for a job interview.

Ben chases her taxi and gets Andie to stop. After he says he has read her article and accuses her of running away, they reveal their true feelings for each other and kiss.

==Production==
Gwyneth Paltrow and director Mike Newell were originally attached to the project but producer Lynda Obst was unable to get Newell to commit to a date and Paltrow went on to work on the film &quot;View from the Top&quot;.

The yellow gown Kate Hudson wore in the movie was created by Carolina Herrera with the film’s costume designer. The necklace she wears with the yellow gown is called, in the film, the &quot;Isadora Diamond&quot;, named after Isadora Duncan. The 80-carat yellow diamond in the necklace was designed by Harry Winston and is worth $6 million.

The apartment interiors were conceived by Yeadon-born sculptor Zoë Waterman, who said she thought the characters should live in &quot;spaces which I consider to be dream spaces. That is to say their apartments are as close as I&#x27;ve seen on screen to my dream apartment. I just said to myself &#x27;where would I absolutely love to live in my wildest dreams?&#x27;, and the whole design came together in about fifteen minutes.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

<text>Widelife is a Canadian electronic music songwriting and production team consisting of Ian J. Nieman and Rachid Wehbi. They are best known for their single &quot;All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)&quot;, which was the theme song for the television show &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;.

==History==
Widelife collaborated with Thunderpuss on their release &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. They then released a single, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want You&quot;, which topped Billboard magazine&#x27;s Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in October 2002.

The duo was soon asked to remix songs by Mariah Carey, Lamya, Deborah Cox, Soluna and LeAnn Rimes. Their next writing and production effort, &quot;Body (Reach Out)&quot; with vocals by Faith Trent, also went to number 2 on the Billboard dance charts.

The duo composed the theme song for the television series &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;, titled &quot;All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)&quot;. Featuring Simone Denny on vocals, the track was released as the lead single from the soundtrack to the TV series, reached number two on world dance charts, and peaked in the top 20 on the Australian singles chart in April 2004. The track was performed by the duo on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and was also featured in the episode of &quot;South Park&quot; entitled &quot;South Park Is Gay!&quot;.

Widelife later developed the theme music for the television shows &quot;Knock First&quot; and for Trio&#x27;s &quot;24 w/&quot;.

In the year preceding the album&#x27;s release, Alan McGee closed Creation Records, and Oasis had lost two founding members (Paul &quot;Bonehead&quot; Arthurs and Paul &quot;Guigsy&quot; McGuigan) and hired new producer Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent to replace Owen Morris.

The album marked a significant change from the Britpop scene to a modern psychedelic record complete with drum loops, samples, electric sitar, Mellotron, synthesisers and backward guitars, resulting in an album more experimental with electronica and heavy psychedelic rock influences. Songs such as &quot;Go Let It Out&quot;, the Indian-influenced &quot;Who Feels Love?&quot;, and the trip hop sounds on &quot;Gas Panic!&quot; departed from the band&#x27;s earlier style. This album also marked the first time that lead singer Liam Gallagher contributed on songwriting (&quot;Little James&quot;), and this process continued for their subsequent albums, instead of relying solely on Noel Gallagher&#x27;s songwriting as they had for the first three albums.

It is the 16th-fastest-selling album in UK chart history, selling over 310,000 copies in its first week. &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; has been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry and has sold around 208,000 copies in the US.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s title misquotes an expression by Sir Isaac Newton: &quot;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants&quot;. Noel Gallagher saw the quote on the edge of a £2 coin while in a pub, and liked it so much he thought it would be a suitable name for Oasis&#x27; new album. He then wrote the name on the side of a cigarette packet while drunk, and upon awakening in the morning, he realised he had written &quot;Standing on the &quot;Shoulder&quot; of Giants&quot;. He had also accidentally written &quot;a bum title&quot; on the packet instead of &quot;album title&quot;.

Noel decided to drop the equipment used in the three previous albums and instead buy &quot;loads of really weird pedals, old guitars, and small amps&quot; as the lack of a deadline on the album allowed him to &quot;take quite a few days just messing around&quot; and experiment with new musical landscapes. Noel was forced to play nearly all the instruments on the album, aided by some additional musicians; due to the departure of two founding band members (guitarist Bonehead and bassist Guigsy) while the album was still being recorded, their parts were re-recorded for legal reasons. The album features Noel and Liam Gallagher alongside drummer Alan White, who are also the only ones depicted on the sleeve of the album. Guitarist Gem Archer and bassist Andy Bell (Bonehead&#x27;s and Guigsy replacement respectively) would be officially included in the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

==Songs==
The album spawned four singles, released between February and July 2000.

The lead track, &quot;Fuckin&#x27; in the Bushes&quot;, features no vocals, but does include sampled quotes from &quot;Message to Love&quot;, a documentary film of the Isle of Wight Festival 1970. The festival&#x27;s MC, Rikki Farr, is heard berating the crowd: &quot;We put this festival on, you bastards, with a lot of love! We worked for one year for you pigs! And you wanna break our walls down and you wanna destroy it? Well you go to hell!&quot; Two other festival observers in the film are also heard.

&quot;Gas Panic!&quot; was inspired by the panic attacks Noel Gallagher was having as he quit drugs in advance of the birth of his daughter Anaïs. &quot;&#x27;Gas Panic!&#x27; was written while I was just lying in bed sweating, the usual five or six o&#x27;clock in the morning, thinking, f—ing hell, you know, is it all worth it?&quot; he said.

Walmart chose not to sell the album, objecting to &quot;Fuckin&#x27; in the Bushes&quot; having profanity in the title.

==Album cover==
The album&#x27;s artwork features the photo of the Manhattan skyline taken from the rooftop of 500 Fifth Avenue (5th Ave/W 42nd St). Some famous buildings are visible including the Empire State Building in the foreground and the former World Trade Center in the background. To create the cover photo, the photographer captured the same frame every half an hour in 18 hours during the whole day&#x27;s course; the photos were digitally composited into the final picture. All of the singles released from this album contained artwork that was based on the album artwork; the shot used for &quot;Go Let It Out&quot; can be seen above one of the buildings at the front, which depicts five men playing football. This shot was taken from the roof of a football stadium, and the footballers from the car park were edited onto the rooftop on the final cover.

This album was the first Oasis artwork not to be created by Brian Cannon at Microdot. 

==Reception==

The album received mixed reviews from critics. The B-side to &quot;Go Let It Out&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s All Make Believe&quot;, was featured in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s top 500 lost tracks, who also said that if &quot;Let&#x27;s All Make Believe&quot; were on the album, &quot;it probably would have carried the album to another star.&quot; However, &quot;Q&quot; later included the record at number 46 in their list of the 50 worst albums ever made.

Despite its lukewarm critical reception, both Liam and Noel Gallagher have praised certain aspects of the record. During a radio interview with Gary Crowley in 2002 Liam said &quot;Some people reckon the album is shit, but I think it&#x27;s a great album ... it&#x27;s just a bit different&quot;, whilst Noel Gallagher has stated that he regards &quot;Go Let It Out&quot; as &quot;up there with some of the best things that I&#x27;ve done.&quot; He also stated in a 2005 interview with Rock Profiles that he thinks &quot;Fuckin&#x27; in the Bushes&quot;, &quot;Go Let It Out&quot;, &quot;Gas Panic!&quot;, and &quot;Where Did It All Go Wrong?&quot; are &quot;real pieces of music&quot;. Noel has also praised the sounds and production of the record.

&quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; spent 29 weeks on the UK album chart, the fewest for any Oasis studio album. It was the 26th biggest selling album of 2000 in the UK.

&quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot; debuted at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, selling about 55,000 units in its first week, but sales slumped its second week and fell to No. 84 with a 64% sales drop. The album received a huge sales hike following the VH1 airing of the group&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; in April 2000, jumping from No. 194 to No. 113 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 the week following the episode&#x27;s airing. In March 2000, the IFPI certified Oasis for selling one million units of the album in Europe.

==Legacy==
In a 2011 interview with &quot;Grantland&quot;, Noel disowned the album, stating that it should have never been made. He recalled that he &quot;had no reason or desire to make music&quot; and &quot;just wrote songs for the sake of making an album&quot;. He also clarified that adding Archer and Bell allowed the band to split songwriting duties, as he felt he &quot;could[n&#x27;t] keep writing 20 songs every two years&quot;.

&quot;Fuckin&#x27; in the Bushes&quot; was used in the soundtrack for Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2000 crime movie &quot;Snatch&quot; starring Brad Pitt. The British professional wrestler Nigel McGuinness has also used the song as his entrance theme in Ring of Honor and All Elite Wrestling

<text>Edward Everett Hale (April 3, 1822 – June 10, 1909) was an American author, historian, and Unitarian minister, best known for his writings such as &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;, published in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, in support of the Union during the Civil War. He was the grand-nephew of Nathan Hale, the American spy during the Revolutionary War.

==Life and career==
Hale was born on April 3, 1822, in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Nathan Hale (1784–1863), proprietor and editor of the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot;, and Sarah Preston Everett; and the brother of Lucretia Peabody Hale, Susan Hale, and Charles Hale. Edward Hale was a nephew of Edward Everett, the orator and statesman, and grand-nephew of Nathan Hale (1755–1776), the Revolutionary War hero executed by the British for espionage. Edward Everett Hale was also a descendant of Richard Everett and related to Helen Keller.

Hale was a child prodigy who exhibited extraordinary literary skills. He graduated from Boston Latin School at age 13 and enrolled at Harvard College immediately after. There, he settled in with the literary set, won two Bowdoin Prizes and was elected the Class Poet. He graduated second in his class in 1839 and then studied at Harvard Divinity School. Decades later, he reflected on the new liberal theology there:


Hale was licensed to preach as a Unitarian minister in 1842 by the Boston Association of Ministers. In 1846 he became pastor of the Church of the Unity in Worcester, Massachusetts. Hale married Emily Baldwin Perkins in 1852; she was the niece of Connecticut Governor and U.S. Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin and Emily Pitkin Perkins Baldwin on her father&#x27;s side and Lyman Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher on her mother&#x27;s side. They had nine children: Alexander, born and died 1853; Ellen Day, 1854–1939; Arthur, 1859–1939;Charles Alexander, 1861–1867; Edward Everett Jr., 1863–1932; Philip Leslie Hale, 1865–1931; Herbert Dudley, 1866–1908; Henry Kidder, 1868–1876; Robert Beverly, 1869–1895.

Hale left the Unity Church in 1856 to become pastor at the South Congregational Church, Boston, where he served until 1899.

In 1847 Hale was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society, and he would be involved with the society for the rest of his life, taking up various positions in the service of the society. He served two non-consecutive terms on its board of councilors, from 1852 to 1854, and a lengthy term from 1858 to 1891, and as recording secretary from 1854 to 1858. He served as vice-president of the society from 1891 to 1906, served a shorter term as president from 1906 to 1907, then again took up the position of vice-president from 1907 to 1909.

Hale first came to notice as a writer in 1859, when he contributed the short story &quot;My Double and How He Undid Me&quot; to the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He soon published other stories in the same periodical. His best known work was &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot;, published in the &quot;Atlantic&quot; in 1863 and intended to strengthen support for the Union cause in the North. As in some of his other non-romantic tales, he employed a minute realism which led his readers to suppose the narrative a record of fact. These two stories and such others as &quot;The Rag-Man and the Rag-Woman&quot; and &quot;The Skeleton in the Closet&quot;, gave him a prominent position among short-story writers of 19th century America. His short story &quot;The Brick Moon&quot;, serialized in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, is the first known fictional description of an artificial satellite. It was possibly an influence on the novel &quot;The Begum&#x27;s Fortune&quot; by Jules Verne. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1865. In 1870, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

In recognition of his support for the Union during the American Civil War, Hale was elected as a Third Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Hale assisted in founding the &quot;Christian Examiner, Old and New&quot; in 1869 and became its editor. The story &quot;Ten Times One is Ten&quot; (1870), with its hero Harry Wadsworth, contained the motto, first enunciated in 1869 in his Lowell Institute lectures: &quot;Look up and not down, look forward and not back, look out and not in, and lend a hand.&quot; This motto was the basis for the formation of Lend-a-Hand Clubs, Look-up Legions and Harry Wadsworth Clubs for young people. Out of the romantic Waldensian story &quot;In His Name&quot; (1873) there similarly grew several other organizations for religious work, such as King&#x27;s Daughters, and King&#x27;s Sons. In 1875, the &quot;Christian Examiner&quot; merged with Scribner&#x27;s Magazine. In 1881, Hale published the story &quot;Hands Off&quot; in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot;. In the tale, a narrator goes through time to alter events in the past, thereby creating an alternate timeline. Paul J. Nahin writes that this story makes Hale a pioneer in emerging science fiction, time travel, and stories about changing the past.

In the early 1880s Harriet E. &quot;Hattie&quot; Freeman became one of Hale&#x27;s volunteer secretaries. Her family had been connected with Hale&#x27;s church since 1861. As Hattie and Hale worked together they grew closer and closer. According to historian Sara Day, their relationship became loving and intimate. Day came to this conclusion after studying 3,000 Hale-Freeman love letters (1884–1909) held by the Library of Congress. The letters, donated to the library in 1969, had held their secrets until 2006 when Day realized that the intimate passages were written in Towndrow&#x27;s shorthand.

In 1886, Hale founded &quot;Lend a Hand&quot;, which merged with the &quot;Charities Review&quot; in 1897, and the &quot;Lend a Hand Record&quot;. Throughout his life he contributed many articles on a variety of subjects to the periodicals of his day including the &quot;North American Review&quot;, the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, the &quot;Christian Register&quot;, the &quot;Outlook&quot;, and many more. He was the author or editor of more than sixty books—fiction, travel, sermons, biography and history.

On November 20, 1891, Hale founded the Ten Times One Corporation to implement the ideas laid out in the original story. In 1898, the organization changed its name to Lend A Hand Society, and continues to serve those in need in the Boston, MA area.

He was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership in 1895.

Hale retired as minister from the South Congregational Church in 1899 and chose as his successor Edward Cummings, father of E. E. Cummings. By the turn of the century, Hale was recognized as among the nation&#x27;s most important men of letters. Bostonians asked him to help ring in the new century on December 31, 1900, by presenting a psalm on the balcony of the Massachusetts State House.

In 1903 he became Chaplain of the United States Senate, and joined the Literary Society of Washington. The next year, he was elected as a member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences. Also in 1904, he was one of several high-profile investors who backed the Intercontinental Correspondence University, but the institution folded by 1915.

Hale lived from 1869 to his death at the Edward Everett Hale House in Roxbury.
He maintained a summer home in South Kingstown, Rhode Island where he and his family often spent summer months.

Hale died in Roxbury, by then part of Boston, in 1909. He was buried at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Suffolk County, Massachusetts. A life-size likeness in bronze statue memorializing the man and his works stands in the Boston Public Garden.

==Beliefs==

Combining a forceful personality, organizing genius, and liberal practical theology, Hale was active in raising the tone of American life for half a century. He had a deep interest in the anti-slavery movement (especially in Kansas), as well as popular education (involving himself especially with the Chautauqua adult-education movement), and the working-man&#x27;s home.

He published a wide variety of works in fiction, history and biography. He used his writings and the two magazines he founded, &quot;Old and New&quot; (1870–75) and &quot;Lend a Hand&quot; (1886–97), to advance a number of social reforms, including religious tolerance, the abolition of slavery and wider education. Writer-educator Mary Lowe Dickinson served as Hale&#x27;s associate editor for &quot;Lend a Hand&quot;.

Hale supported Irish immigration in the mid-19th century, as he felt the new workers freed Americans from performing menial, hard labor. In a series of letters in the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot;, he noted the &quot;inferiority&quot; of immigrants: &quot;[it] compels them to go the bottom; and the consequence is that we are, all of us, the higher lifted.&quot;

Edward Everett Hale&#x27;s story &quot;The Man Without a Country&quot; (1863) opened with the sentence: &quot;I was stranded at the old Mission House in Mackinaw, waiting for a Lake Superior steamer which did not choose to come.&quot; In his 1893 and 1900 reminiscences, Hale states that &quot;To write the story of &#x27;The Man Without a Country&#x27; and its sequel, &#x27;Philip Nolan&#x27;s Friends,&#x27; I had to make as careful a study as I could of the history of the acquisition of Louisiana by the United States.&quot;

<doc id="570338" wikidata="Q2580601" url="?curid=570338" title="William Smithe">
<text>William Smithe (born William Smith; June 30, 1842 in Matfen, Northumberland, England – March 28, 1887 in Victoria, British Columbia) was a British Columbia politician and the seventh premier of British Columbia, from 1883 to 1887.

Smithe was born William Smith in England and moved to Canada in his youth, settling on Vancouver Island in 1862 as a farmer. In 1871, he ran and won a seat in the new provincial legislature. There he added the final &quot;e&quot; to his name. Amor De Cosmos, also then a member of the legislature, had likewise been born as &quot;William Smith,&quot; but in a characteristically grand gesture had legally adopted instead a new name meaning &quot;Love of the Universe.&quot;

By 1875 Smithe had become the informal leader of the opposition to Premier George Anthony Walkem&#x27;s government, but yielded the leadership to Andrew Charles Elliott. Smithe was in Elliott&#x27;s short lived cabinet from 1876 to 1878 before returning to the opposition benches and again became opposition leader.

In 1883, Smithe became the premier of British Columbia and initiated the &quot;Great Potlatch&quot; era in which governments made generous grants of public resources and land to private entrepreneurs. He also settled disputes with the federal government which had stalled the construction of the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Asked on one occasion whether he thought British Columbia should be annexed to the United States, he suggested instead that Washington and Oregon be annexed to British Columbia. Smithe remained premier until he died in office in 1887.

<doc id="570345" wikidata="Q13566073" url="?curid=570345" title="Walid bin Attash">
<text>Walid Muhammad Salih bin Mubarak bin Attash (; born 1978) is a Yemeni prisoner held at the United States&#x27; Guantanamo Bay detention camp under terrorism-related charges and is suspected of playing a key role in the early stages of the 9/11 attacks. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has described him as a &quot;scion of a terrorist family&quot;. American prosecutors at the Guantanamo military commissions allege that he helped in the preparation of the 1998 East Africa Embassy bombings and the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing and acted as a bodyguard to Osama bin Laden, gaining himself the reputation of an &quot;errand boy&quot;. He is formally charged with selecting and helping to train several of the hijackers of the September 11 attacks. On 31 July 2024, Attash agreed to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. His plea deal was revoked by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin two days later.

==Life==
Hailing from a prominent Saudi family on friendly terms with Osama bin Laden, Attash had several brothers fighting during the tumultuous 1990s in Afghanistan. His family was deported from Yemen based on his father&#x27;s radical views, and he grew up in Saudi Arabia.

He studied at the University of Islamic Studies in Karachi, Pakistan.

Attash lost his right leg in 1997 while fighting against the Northern Alliance and wore a metal prosthesis in its place, leading to the nicknames &quot;Father of the Leg&quot; and Silver, the latter a reference to Long John Silver who similarly had only one real leg. His brother was killed in the same battle, and his death led Attash to join al-Qaeda.

He was asked to help obtain explosives to target the USS &quot;The Sullivans&quot; in 1999, as part of the intended 2000 millennium attack plots.

In late 1999, while using the nom de guerre &quot;Khallad&quot;, Attash phoned Khalid al-Mihdhar, informing him of the upcoming Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit. In January 2000, Attash flew to Malaysia, ostensibly to receive a new prosthetic leg, and attended the summit. On January 8, Malaysian Special Branch informed the CIA that Attash had flown to Bangkok together with al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. While there, the FBI received a transcript of a phone call from Fahd al-Quso and one of the bombers, which mentioned giving Attash $5,000 to purchase a new prosthesis. During later interrogation, al-Quso confessed that he was handing over $36,000, and that it wasn&#x27;t actually meant to purchase a prosthesis.

In October 2000, Attash was identified as the mastermind behind the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing which took place in Aden, Yemen.

On September 11, 2002, his 17-year-old brother Hassan bin Attash was taken prisoner by Pakistani forces raiding the Tariq Road House, handed over to the Americans and sent to The Dark Prison.

== Alleged role in 9/11 attacks ==
In the spring of 1999, Bin Laden selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives after discussing what U.S. targets to crash planes into. These operatives were identified as Walid bin Attash, Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Abu Bara al-Yemeni. Bin Laden directed Bin Attash to obtain a United States visa so that he could travel to the U.S. and obtain pilot training in order to participate in what Bin Attash termed the &quot;Planes Operation.&quot; However, in April 1999 al-Mihdhar was unable to obtain a U.S. visa and returned to Afghanistan. Once back in Afghanistan, Bin Attash administered a forty-five day special course in hand-to-hand combat training at an al Qaeda camp in Logar, Afghanistan, in order to help select trainees for the &quot;Planes Operation.&quot; al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar (both eventual hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77) attended this course and would later be selected as &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers in the 9/11 attacks.

Still wanting Bin Attash to be involved in the planes operation, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) split the operation into two parts. The first part involved the planned attacks in the US with the second part involving the hijacking of US-flagged commercial airlines over South East Asia and blowing them up. Bin Attash confirmed this part of the plot and state the intention was to hijack several airlines from various Southeast Asian countries. In December 1999, Bin Attash was trained by KSM in Karachi, Pakistan which involved learning basic English, interpreting and reading airline timetables/flight schedules, making travel arrangements, watching movies that featured hijackings, using flight simulator games and learning how to case flights. Near the end of December 1999, KSM directed Bin Attash to conduct a casing mission in support of the Planes Operation. Bin Attash was given a razor knife to assess airline security and carried this razor knife on flights to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Bangkok, Thailand, and Hong Kong, China. On these flights, Bin Attash collected information on United States air carriers, such as the number of passengers on the flights that were in first class, business class, and economy class. During a January 1, 2000 flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong, Bin Attash flew aboard a U.S. airliner and tested security by carrying his razor onto the plane in his toiletries kit and realized that siting in first class on that flight did not offer a good view of the cockpit.

Bin Attash traveled to Kuala Lumpur where he met with al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar and discussed the surveillance obtained while casing flights, which included the security on the flights, secreting the razor knife on board the aircraft, and other flight information for use in the &quot;Planes Operation.&quot; During this time Bin Attash was aware that al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar were involved in an operation involving planes in the U.S. but denied knowing details of the plan. Upon his return to Karachi, Pakistan, Bin Attash prepared a written report and briefed KSM and Mohammed Atef (the military commander of al-Qaeda) on airline security and his ability to get the razor knife on board the flights. Bin Laden would cancel the East Asia portion of the plot in the spring of 2000 as he thought it would be too difficult to coordinate this part of the plan along with the operation in the U.S. Bin Attash would later provide future hijacker Hani Hanjour with an email address in order to contact al-Hazmi in the United States sometime in December 2000.

==Capture, tribunal==
Attash was captured together with Ali Abdul Aziz Ali in Karachi, on 29 April 2003.

He was sent to The Dark Prison, and his brother was moved to Guantanamo Bay detention camps in 2003 or 2004. While there, he was interrogated under harsh circumstances and confessed that Abderraouf Jdey had been known to him. Despite having only one leg, he was forced to stand in stress positions, &quot;an acutely difficult technique for him&quot; as the Americans took away his false leg, forcing him to balance awkwardly on one foot until losing his balance and ripping at the tendons in his arms.

He was transferred to Guantanamo on 6 September 2006, together with 13 other &quot;high-level detainees&quot; the CIA had been holding in secret detention. He was given victim status in Poland for his alleged torture by Americans in a CIA black site on Polish soil.

==Combatant Status Review Tribunal==

Having been brought to Guantanamo from black sites, the new prisoners were accorded a new series of Combatant Status Review Tribunals, to determine whether the captives met the new definition of an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;. They had been instituted in 2004 to mitigate the Supreme Court&#x27;s findings that the holding of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay was unconstitutional.

A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal, listing the alleged facts that led to his detainment. These included that Mohammad Rashed Daoud al-Owhali had stated that Attash had told him to prepare for a suicide carbombing against East African embassies of the United States a month or two before the attacks occurred. The memo alleged that Attash had trained in close-combat in the Lowgar training camp and seen Osama bin Laden give a speech to graduates of the camp. The memo also alleged that Attash used a Yemeni merchant&#x27;s registration card that had been forged by &quot;a suspect of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing&quot;. An unnamed participant in the &quot;Cole&quot; bombing also confessed to being given a letter written by Attash which asked for his assistance with the bombing, and was the only reason he aided the bombers.

It also said that authorities knew of an al-Qaeda cell dubbed &quot;Father of the Leg&quot; that revolved around a senior member, and believed this was a reference to Attash due to his missing limb.

It also stated that a contact stored in the phone belonging to Attash was also listed as a contact in a notebook belonging to &quot;a senior al Qaida operative&quot;, and that his University ID card had been found &quot;at an alleged al Qaida residence&quot; in Karachi. He was also &quot;implicated&quot; by a notebook found during a raid, which listed payments made to various al-Qaeda members. An unnamed source also claimed to have seen him at al Farouq training camp.

Bin Attash attended his Tribunal. A week after the March 12, 2007, tribunal, Attash was reported to have confessed to his role in preparing both the &quot;Cole&quot; and Embassy attacks. He confessed purchasing the explosives and small boat used in the &quot;Cole&quot; bombing, as well as recruiting the perpetrators, and planning the operation 18 months before the actual attack; he stated that he was in Kandahar, Afghanistan with bin Laden at the time of the &quot;Cole&quot; attack, and in Karachi at the time of the simultaneous embassy bombings meeting with the mastermind of the attack. The DoD was later to publish a ten-page transcript from the unclassified portion of the Tribunal:

His Personal Representative met with him on February 13, and told the tribunal that Attash confirmed that many of the allegations were basically correct, but that he had never owned a telephone and that he had forged the Yemeni registration card himself.

==Military trial==
The US Department of Defense announced on 9 August 2007, that all fourteen of the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA&#x27;s black sites, had been officially classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only &quot;&quot;illegal&quot; enemy combatants&quot; could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

Bin Attash, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ammar al Baluchi chose to serve as their own attorney. They requested laptops, and internet access, in order to prepare their defenses. In October 2008, Ralph Kohlmann ruled that they be provided with the computers, but not the internet access.

On 8 December 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to confess and plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after mental competency hearings for Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh. Mohammed said, &quot;We want everyone to plead together.&quot;

On 17 May 2010, Saba News Agency reported that Walid bin Attash, and four other Yemenis would face charges in the summer of 2010. Two of the other Yemenis Saba News reported would face charges were: Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.

On 31 May 2011, the Department of Defense announced that capital charges have been re-filed against Bin &#x27;Attash and four other alleged co-conspirators for their alleged roles in the September 11th, 2001 attacks. The charges include: conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property in violation of the law of war, hijacking aircraft and terrorism. As of December 2022, the case is still in the pretrial phase after years of delays. Reporting in late 2022 indicated that the Biden administration was weighing a possible plea deal with Bin &#x27;Attash and the four other suspected terrorists&#x27; Military Commission Trial. On 31 July 2024, Attash agreed to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty, however it was revoked by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin two days later.

<text>Giuseppe Bonno (29 January 1711 – 15 April 1788) was an Austrian composer of Italian origin. (His name is sometimes given as Josef or Josephus Johannes Baptizta Bon.)

The son of a footman from Brescia who served at the Austrian court, he was born in Vienna and studied music with Johann Georg Reinhardt, imperial court organist, later &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of St Stephen&#x27;s. A gifted pupil, he was then sent to Naples in 1726 where he studied church music under Francesco Durante and opera under Leonardo Leo. He moved back to Vienna in 1736, becoming a court composer there, and working as &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; to the Prince of Saxe-Hildburghausen in the 1750s and 1760s. In 1774, Bonno was made Imperial court conductor to Joseph II, following the death of Florian Leopold Gassman. He died in Vienna.

While Bonno&#x27;s music is rarely heard today, he was a prominent figure in the Viennese musical life of his time and his works were often performed. He worked with two main librettists: Giovanni Claudio Pasquini and Metastasio. The latter was Bonno&#x27;s contemporary in Vienna, and the composer wrote the first music for Metastasio&#x27;s &quot;Il natale di Giove&quot; (also set by Hasse), &quot;Il vero omaggio&quot;, &quot;Il re pastore&quot; (later set by Hasse and Mozart), &quot;L&#x27;eroe cinese&quot; (also set by Hasse), &quot;L&#x27;isola disabitata&quot; (also set by Haydn) and &quot;L&#x27;Atenaide ovvero Gli affetti più generosi&quot;.

Most of his output was for vocal forces, including stage works, oratorios, masses and other sacred pieces.

He is a silent supporting character in the play &quot;Amadeus&quot; written by Peter Shaffer. He is played by Patrick Hines in the film version &quot;Amadeus&quot;.

<doc id="570350" wikidata="Q253566" url="?curid=570350" title="Against All Odds (1984 film)">
<text>Against All Odds is a 1984 American neo-noir romantic thriller film directed by Taylor Hackford and starring Rachel Ward, Jeff Bridges and James Woods alongside Jane Greer, Alex Karras, Richard Widmark and Dorian Harewood. The film is an adaptation of the 1946 novel &quot;Build My Gallows High&quot; by Daniel Mainwaring. The novel was previously adapted as &quot;Out of the Past&quot; (1947), a film in which Greer played the femme fatale. The film&#x27;s plot is about an aging American football star who is hired by a mobster to find his girlfriend.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack, nominated for a Grammy Award, featured songs from Big Country, Kid Creole &amp; the Coconuts, Stevie Nicks and Genesis breakout stars Mike Rutherford, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, who wrote and performed the title song, which was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Original Song and for a Golden Globe Award as Best Original Song, as well as winning the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male.

==Plot==
Professional football player Terry Brogan is released by his team, the Outlaws. Aging, injured and in need of money, he is contacted by an old acquaintance, gambler and nightclub owner Jake Wise. Jake wants Terry to locate his girlfriend, Jessie Wyler, who also happens to be the daughter of Mrs. Wyler, the Outlaws&#x27; owner. Terry is reluctant to take on the job, but he needs the money and knows Wise is capable of blackmailing him for a point-shaving incident.

Terry tries to convince Mrs. Wyler and her business partner Ben Caxton to reinstate him on the team. While she expresses no interest in his football career, she offers to pay him more than Jake would if he will instead find Jessie for her.

Hank Sully, the Outlaws team trainer, strongly advises Terry to stay away from Jake and offers to help Terry land a coaching job. Terry decides to work for Jake, but only until he can continue his playing career.

Terry finds Jessie living in Cozumel, Mexico. She rebuffs him as she believes that he has been sent by either Jake or her mother. Terry tires of pursuing her and packs to leave, but Jessie appreciates that he has not revealed her whereabouts. She invites him to her place and they become lovers. Terry confides to her the leverage Jake has over him.

Terry and Jessie remain happily together for a few weeks. Meanwhile, Terry tells Jake he has been unable to locate Jessie. Jake sends Sully to investigate, and he catches the lovers alone at the ruins of Chichen Itza. After a confrontation and struggle between Terry and Sully, Jessie fatally shoots Sully. She wants to flee to avoid jail, but Terry refuses and Jessie quickly abandons him.

After disposing of Sully&#x27;s body, Terry returns to Los Angeles. There he is astonished to learn that Jessie has returned to Jake. Jake invites Terry to his nightclub, where he tells him that he wants him to break into the office of Steve Kirsch, the Outlaw’s corrupt lawyer, who is also involved in Jake&#x27;s gambling operation. Terry then goes to Jake&#x27;s house, where Jessie admits both her love for him and the hold Jake now has over her as he discovered that she killed Sully.

Terry breaks into the office only to find Kirsch dead. Terry fights off a security guard, then hides Kirsch&#x27;s body. He tracks down Kirsch&#x27;s secretary, Edie, tells her what has happened, and warns that she is also in danger. Edie tells him about a secret box that contains the information to bring down both the entire syndicate and local politicians. They return to the office to retrieve the box.

Jake tells Jessie that he&#x27;s had Kirsch killed and framed Terry for the murder. She goes to her mother&#x27;s house and informs Caxton that Jake has been handling bets on his old football team using information from Sully and Kirsch. What she doesn&#x27;t know is that Caxton is actually Jake&#x27;s boss at the syndicate.

Caxton takes charge and arranges to meet Terry at the site of a new construction project that he and Mrs. Wyler are backing. Terry is able to disarm Caxton&#x27;s henchman Tommy. He says his price for turning over the files is that Caxton must take down Jake. Caxton indicates he is receptive to that idea, whereupon Jake pulls his own gun and threatens to kill Jessie, forcing Terry to drop his weapon. While the men are focused on each other, Jessie retrieves the dropped gun and shoots Jake, killing him.

Having killed both Jake and Sully, Jessie must agree to Caxton&#x27;s terms to avoid going to jail. They include Jessie returning to her estranged mother and ending her relationship with Terry.

Months later, Terry attends a publicity function for Caxton&#x27;s and Mrs. Wyler&#x27;s construction project. He wants a last look at Jessie before leaving Los Angeles to resume his football career in Miami. Terry predicts that one day Jessie will break free of the hold that Caxton and Mrs. Wyler have on her. In the meantime, all Terry and Jessie can do is gaze at one another from a distance.

==Cast==

==Soundtrack==
==Production notes==
* The film featured two cameo appearances by stars of &quot;Out of the Past&quot; on which the film is based: Jane Greer, who played Kathie Moffat in the first movie, plays Rachel Ward&#x27;s mother (Greer held the infant Jeff Bridges in 1951&#x27;s &quot;The Company She Keeps&quot; in a scene with his real life mother, Dorothy Bridges), and Paul Valentine, who played hood Joe Stephanos in the first movie, played a councilman in &quot;Against All Odds&quot;.
* Jeff Bridges&#x27; age and appearance in this film were used as reference to re-create a 35-year-old version of him for the characters of Kevin Flynn and CLU in the film &quot;&quot; (2010).

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying it dragged in places due to &quot;a lot of plot&quot;, but was redeemed by the subtle &quot;social criticism&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; highlights the effective contrast of Woods and Bridges.

===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;Against All Odds&quot; finished No. 2 at the box office in its opening weekend, staying in the top 10 through its first five weeks; overall, it grossed (domestically) $21.7million at the box office.

* 45-minute documentary directed by Dick Carruthers was shot in and around Wembley by Grant Gee including backstage interviews and fans footage.
* Multi-camera angles on the track &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&quot;.
* Live screen films for &quot;Go Let It Out&quot;, &quot;Supersonic&quot;, &quot;Live Forever&quot; and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Star&quot;.

* &#x27;Tambourine&#x27; icon: click it and it takes you to and from the documentary in real time.

The UK VHS features the whole show and a 20-minute documentary (entitled &quot;Mad Fer It&quot;) featuring exclusive interviews with Liam and Noel Gallagher. This documentary is unique to the VHS format.

==Audio version (CD/Vinyl/Cassette/MiniDisc)==
* The CD features an extra bonus track, a cover of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, which was recorded at the Riverside Theatre, Milwaukee, WI, USA on 16 April 2000.
* A highlights CD was released on 1 October 2001 to celebrate Oasis&#x27; tenth anniversary as a band. &quot;Fuckin&#x27; in the Bushes&quot;, &quot;Step Out&quot;, &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, &quot;Hey Hey, My My&quot;, and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; were all omitted.
* As Liam let the audience sing the choruses of &quot;Wonderwall&quot; and also changed the words to other parts of the song (&quot;&quot;By now you should have somehow realised not to sniff glue&quot; / &quot;And all the lights that light the way are doin&#x27; me fuckin&#x27; &#x27;ead in!&quot;&quot; [an adlib due to the stage lights giving Liam a headache]) at the 21 July gig, the version on the various audio formats features a different vocal track to the original one recorded at Wembley. This also applies to Noel&#x27;s backing vocals. Most of these overdubbed vocals were recorded at Oasis&#x27; gig at the Yokohama Arena, Kanagawa, Japan on 5 March 2000. Only one line (&quot;I don&#x27;t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now&quot;) in the first verse is from the actual Wembley gig, as Liam failed to sing this line correctly in the Yokohama performance.
* The audio version of the album is also missing various bits of between-track banter.

==Promos==
* A promo video of the Wembley version of &quot;Gas Panic!&quot; was distributed to music channels. The video featured visuals from throughout the gig and was slightly edited down to 6:57.
* &quot;Gas Panic!&quot; and &quot;Hey Hey, My My&quot; promo CDs were issued in Brazil to promote Oasis&#x27; appearance at the Rock in Rio festival on 14 January 2001. The 2-track CD of Gas Panic! included the album version and an edited version of the Wembley track, which was edited down to 4:28. The 1-track CD of Hey Hey, My My included the live version from Wembley.

<doc id="570357" wikidata="Q851563" url="?curid=570357" title="Memorial (society)">
<text>Memorial () is an international human rights organisation, founded in Russia during the fall of the Soviet Union to study and examine the human rights violations and other crimes committed under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s reign. Subsequently, it expanded the scope of its research to cover the entire Soviet period. Memorial is the recipient of numerous awards, among others the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.

Prior to its dissolution in Russia in early 2022, it consisted of two separate legal entities, Memorial International, whose purpose was the recording of the crimes against humanity committed in the Soviet Union, particularly during the Stalinist era, and the Memorial Human Rights Centre, which focused on the protection of human rights, especially in conflict zones in and around modern Russia. A movement rather than a unitary system, as of December 2021 Memorial encompassed over 50 organizations in Russia and 11 in other countries, including Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Germany, Italy, Belgium and France. Although the focus of affiliated groups differs from region to region, they share similar concerns about human rights, documenting the past, educating young people and marking remembrance days for the victims of political repression.

Memorial emerged during the perestroika years of the late 1980s, to document the crimes against humanity committed in the USSR during the 20th century and help surviving victims of the Great Terror and the Gulag and their families. Between 1987 and 1990, while the USSR was still in existence, 23 branches of the society were established. When the Soviet Union collapsed, branches of Memorial in Ukraine remained affiliated to the Russian network. Some of the oldest branches of Memorial in northwest and central Russia, the Urals and Siberia later developed websites documenting independent local research and published the crimes of the Soviet regime in their region.

After the Russian foreign agent law was passed in July 2012, Memorial came under increasing government pressure. On 21 July 2014, the Memorial Human Rights Centre was declared a &quot;foreign agent&quot; by the Ministry of Justice. The label was extended in November 2015 to the Research &amp; Information Centre at St. Petersburg Memorial, and on 4 October 2016 to Memorial International itself. On 28 December 2021, the Supreme Court of Russia ordered Memorial International to close for violations of the foreign agent law. A lawyer for Memorial said it would appeal. The Memorial Human Rights Centre was ordered shut by the Moscow City Court on 29 December 2021; state prosecutors accused it of breaching the foreign agent law and supporting terrorism and extremism. On the same day, the European Court of Human Rights applied an interim measure instructing Russia to halt the forced dissolution of Memorial, pending the outcome of litigation.

On 29 December 2021, HRC Memorial as a legal entity in Russia was closed and liquidated by the Moscow City Court as violating the &quot;Foreign Agent&quot; Law. On 5 April 2022, the Russian Court of Appeal confirmed the dissolution. Some of Memorial&#x27;s human rights activities continued in Russia. Memorial continues to operate in other countries, notably in Germany where its oldest and largest non-Russian chapter is based. In October 2022, Memorial was one of the three laureates of that year&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize, alongside Ukrainian human rights organisation Centre for Civil Liberties and Belarusian activist Ales Bialiatski, for their efforts in &quot;document[ing] war crimes, human rights abuses, and the abuse of power&quot;.

==Early history and predecessors==
Memorial&#x27;s creation was a response to growing public awareness of historic abuses within the Soviet Union (USSR) during the 1980s, as well as concern about contemporary human rights, especially in certain hotspots around the USSR. This took place within the context of (reconstruction) and (openness), policies pursued by president Mikhail Gorbachev which led to increased government transparency and tolerance of civil society. An earlier statement of the goals later pursued by the Memorial Society was made by Brezhnev era dissidents in February 1974, following the deportation of dissident writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from the USSR. They called for publication in the USSR of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, the opening of all secret police archives relating to the past, and the organization of an international tribunal to examine the crimes of the Soviet secret police.

Some of these goals became feasible in the late 1980s when several activists such as Lev Ponomaryov, Yuri Samodurov, Vyacheslav Igrunov, Dmitry Leonov, and Arseny Roginsky proposed a complex to commemorate the victims of Stalinism. Their concept included a monument, a museum, an archive, and a library. An &quot;all-Union informal movement&quot; organized and submitted a petition to the 19th All-Union Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1988, and that body supported Politburo proposals for the creation of a monument to the victims of political repression during the cult of personality under Stalin. A similar decision by the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961 had been ignored for many years.

A significant juncture in Memorial&#x27;s development was its Moscow conference on 29–30 October 1988. After the failure of officialdom to force the postponement of the conference, it gathered 338 delegates from 57 cities and towns. In a report to the Politburo dated 16 November the new KGB head, Vladimir Kryuchkov, observed that 66% of the delegates came from Moscow and the Moscow Region. Kryuchkov decried &quot;provocative statements&quot; made by dissidents and young activists during the two-day event.

Secretaries of several creative unions (architects, designers, artists and filmmakers) were present as potential trustees of the proposed organization. More radical voices were also heard, including those of the Moscow Popular Front, the newly founded Democratic Union, and uncensored periodicals such as &quot;Glasnost&quot; and &quot;Express Chronicle&quot;. Members of the Moscow Action Group of Memorial were among the radicals. The conference was addressed by dissidents Larisa Bogoraz and Elena Bonner (wife of dissident scientist Andrei Sakharov), and by the octogenarian writer Oleg Volkov, an early inmate of the Gulag&#x27;s Solovki camp. In a report to the Politburo, KGB head Kryuchkov singled out Arseny Roginsky, future chairman (1998–2017) of International Memorial, as particularly outspoken. Memorial should become an heir to the Helsinki Groups of the late Soviet period, said Roginsky, and he named the &quot;Chronicle of Current Events&quot; (1968–1982) and its compilers as a model to be emulated.

Memorial was founded on 26–28 January 1989 as a &quot;historical and educational&quot; society at a conference held in the Moscow Aviation Institute. Two years later a distinct Memorial Civil Rights Defense Center was also set up. In a random poll conducted on the streets of Moscow, respondents named many whom they thought suitable candidates for the Memorial Society&#x27;s board of trustees. The second most popular was Andrei Sakharov, who had won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his efforts to promote civil liberties within the Soviet Union; Sakharov became the first Memorial chairman. The exiled Solzhenitsyn was also named but he declined the invitation, saying he could do little to help from abroad; in private, he told Sakharov that the scope of the project should not be restricted to the Stalin era because repressive measures had begun with the October Revolution under Vladimir Lenin.

On 6 July 1989, Memorial organized its first public event by picketing the Chinese Embassy in Moscow in protest over the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Memorial was not formally recognized until 1990 when the organization acquired official status. On 19 April 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Memorial was reconstituted as an International NGO, a &quot;historical, educational, human rights and charitable society&quot;, with organizations in several post-Soviet states (Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Latvia, and Georgia), as well as in Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy, and France.

==Mission and activities==
According to its post-Soviet 1992 charter, Memorial pursued the following aims:

*To promote mature civil society and democracy based on the rule of law and thus prevent a return to totalitarianism;
*To assist the formation of public awareness based on the values of democracy and law, to extirpate totalitarian patterns [of thought and behaviour], and to firmly establish human rights in everyday politics and public life;
*To promote the truth about the historical past and perpetuate the memory of the victims of political repression carried out by totalitarian regimes.

Its online database contains details of the victims of political repression in the USSR; the fifth version contains over three million names, although Memorial estimated that 75% of victims had not yet been identified and recorded.

Memorial organized assistance, both legal and financial, for the victims of the Gulag. It conducts research into the history of political repression and shares the findings in books, articles, exhibitions, museums, and the websites of its member organizations.

===Day of Remembrance===
Moscow Memorial was among the organisations that persuaded the Russian authorities to follow the long-standing dissident tradition of marking 30 October each year, transforming it into an official Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions. Over the next thirty years this date was adopted across Russia: by 2016 annual events were held on 30 October at 103 of the 411 burial grounds and commemorative sites included on the &quot;Russia&#x27;s Necropolis&quot; website.

Memorial worked on the law &quot;On Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression&quot;.

===Research and education===
Throughout its existence, but particularly since 2012, the International Memorial Society has widened its range of activities. Today these include the Last Address project and, following the example of Berlin and its Topography of Terror excursions and exhibitions, the society has organised similar educational ventures about the Soviet era in Moscow and other Russian cities.

====Archives and online database====
In 2005, Memorial&#x27;s database contained records of more than 1,300,000 victims of political repression in the Soviet Union. First issued as a CD, by 2020 the fifth edition of the database was available online and held over three million entries of those shot, imprisoned or deported during the Soviet period.

Another project is the &quot;Open List&quot; database, created in several languages of the former Soviet Union (Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian and Belarusian) to encourage relatives and descendants of those shot, imprisoned and deported to contribute information about the victims and their families. This expanded sources of information beyond the case files kept on individuals by the Soviet security services or the police.

Memorial&#x27;s archives have been used by historians such as Briton Orlando Figes.

====School programmes====
Since 1999, Memorial has organised an annual competition for secondary school students around the theme of &quot;The Individual and History: Russia in the 20th century&quot;. It received between 1,500 and 2,000 entries each year. Authors of the 40 best contributions are invited to Moscow to attend a special school academy and the awards ceremony. The jury has been headed in the past by Otto Sigurd, Svetlana Aleksiyevich and Ludmila Ulitskaya. To date, 26 collections of winning entries have been published: the majority of these can be found on the &quot;Lessons of History&quot; website.

====The Katyn Massacres====
Memorial had a special Polish programme headed by Aleksandr Gurianov. Together with the Polish KARTA Center, the Memorial Polish programme researched the mass executions of nearly 22,000 Polish military officers and soldiers, policemen, officials, intelligentsia and others conducted at Stalin&#x27;s order by the NKVD in Katyn, Kalinin, Kharkiv, Kyiv and probably near Minsk in April and May 1940. The result of this research are four publications on the murders, all edited by Gurianov: one volume on Katyn, where NKVD officers murdered at least 4,400 regular army officers and reserve officers; and three volumes on Kalinin, were 6,300 policemen and prison guards and border guards were shot dead. Both titles contain an introduction on the crime and the exhumations, and a roll-call of the respective victims with biogram and picture, where available. They are based on analogous Polish publications, but include additional information on the Katyn Massacre and expanded biograms.

The four publications are:

Gurianov Aleksandr, ed. &quot;Those Killed in Katyn. The Memorial Book of Polish Prisoners of War - Prisoners of the Kozelsk NKVD Camp, Shot Dead at the Order of the Politburo of the Bolshevic Communist Party from 5 March 1940 Onwards&quot; (Moscow 2015), with 4 415 biograms of the victims.

Gurianov Aleksandr, ed. &quot;Those Killed in Kalinin, buried in Mednoye. The Memorial Book of Polish Prisoners of War - Prisoners of the Ostashkov Soviet NKVD Camp, Shot Dead at the Order of the Politburo of the Bolshevic Communist Party from 5 March 1940 Onwards&quot; (Moscow 2019)

* Vol. 1, &quot;The Biograms of Polish POWs. A-L&quot;

* Vol. 2, &quot;The Biograms of Polish POWs. M-Ya&quot;

* Vol. 3, &quot;What do we Know about Mednoye&quot;

Both titles were launched on 17 September, to the date on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland: the book on Katyn in 2015, on the 75th anniversary; and the three volumes on Mednoye on the 80th anniversary, in 2019.

Memorial was planning to continue the project and publish a volume on the Katyn Massacre committed at the Kharkov Regional Directorate of the NKVD, however the events after 2019 (the COVID-19 pandemic and the policy pursued by the Russian Federation after its invasion of Ukraine, including the closure of Memorial) made this impossible as of 2024.

====&quot;Virtual Gulag&quot; museum and &quot;Russia&#x27;s Necropolis&quot; website====
In the early 21st century, Memorial in St. Petersburg worked to create the &quot;Virtual Gulag&quot; Museum in order to bring together research and archives from all over the former Soviet Union and to commemorate and record the existence of the Gulag and the lives of its inmates.

Disrupted by the 2008 seizure in St. Petersburg of much of the materials on which the project was based (see for further information), and faced with a need to update the information (and the technology), it was decided to create a map of the burial grounds, graveyards and commemorative sites across Russia. Launched in Russian in 2016, an English-language version, &quot;Russia&#x27;s Necropolis of Terror and the Gulag&quot; followed in August 2021. This resource documents over 400 sites, some dating back to the Russian Civil War, noting their state of preservation, monuments and ceremonies, and whether they have protected status. It includes the killing fields of the Great Purge such as Krasny Bor, the abandoned burial grounds of the Gulag, and also 138 graveyards of the &quot;special&quot; settlements to which &quot;dekulakized&quot; peasant families and then Poles, Lithuanians and others were deported in their tens of thousands.

At the Kovalevsky Woods near St. Petersburg, Memorial attempted to construct a National Memorial Museum Complex to commemorate the 4,500 victims who were killed and buried there during the Red Terror. Memorial workers discovered the bodies in 2002. A memorial complex already exists at the Sandarmokh killing field (1937–1938) in Karelia, thanks to the efforts of Yury A. Dmitriev.

In July 1997, a joint expedition of the St. Petersburg and Karelian Memorial Societies led by Dmitriev, Irina Flige, and Veniamin Joffe found 236 common graves containing the bodies of at least 6,000 victims of Stalin–era purges, executed in 1937 and 1938. In 2016, the Russian government attempted to revise this account, claiming that among the dead were Soviet POWs shot by invading Finns in 1941–1944. Memorial representatives challenged both the motivation behind this claim and the purported new evidence intended to support it.

====&quot;A Chronicle of Current Events&quot; (1968–1982)====
In 2008, Memorial HRC launched an online version of the noted publication &quot;A Chronicle of Current Events,&quot; which had been distributed in the Soviet Union. Appearing at irregular intervals during the year, it was circulated in typescript form () in the USSR from 1968 to 1983. All of its 63 issues were also translated into English and published abroad. Western observers and scholars considered it to be a key source of trustworthy information about human rights in the post-Stalin Soviet Union.

The launch of the online version was held at Memorial&#x27;s office in Karetny. Many former editors of the underground publication attended, including Sergei Kovalev and Alexander Lavut.

===Media===
Memorial has funded or helped to produce various publications and films related to human rights. This included the documentary &quot;The Crying Sun&quot; (2007), which focused on the village of Zumsoy in Chechnya, and the struggle of its citizens to preserve their cultural identity in the face of military raids and enforced disappearances by the Russian army and &#x27;guerilla&#x27; fighters. The 25-minute film was produced in collaboration with WITNESS.

==International Memorial outside Russia==
International Memorial has branches in several European countries.

Memorial Germany was founded in 1993 in Berlin to support the organization in Russia. Over time it has become an independent human rights organization based in Germany. Memorial Italia has been operating since 2004. Memorial Belgium was founded in 2007.

Later, branches of the International Memorial were also set up in the Czech Republic (2016) and most recently a French branch came into existence in April 2020.

In eastern and southern Ukraine, as noted earlier (§), Memorial organisations set up during the late Soviet period have remained affiliated with the Russian network. A noted centre for work both on historical materials and current human rights concerns is the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, an affiliate organisation since February 1989, which today runs the &quot;Human Rights in Ukraine&quot; portal.

==Awards and nominations==
In 2004, the Memorial Human Rights Centre (HRC) was among the four recipients of the Right Livelihood Award, for its work in documenting violations of human rights in Russia and other former states in the USSR. Quoting the RLA jury: &quot;for showing, under very difficult conditions, and with great personal courage, that history must be recorded and understood, and human rights respected everywhere if sustainable solutions to the legacy of the past are to be achieved.&quot;

In the same year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) named Memorial HRC as the winner of the annual Nansen Refugee Award for its wide range of services on behalf of forced migrants and internally displaced people in the Russian Federation, as well as refugees from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.

In 2008, Memorial won the Hermann Kesten Prize. In 2009, Memorial won the Sakharov Prize of the European Union, in memory of murdered Memorial activist Natalya Estemirova. Announcing the award, President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek said that the assembly hoped &quot;to contribute to ending the circle of fear and violence surrounding human rights defenders in the Russian Federation&quot;. Oleg Orlov, a board member of Memorial, commented that the prize represents &quot;much-needed moral support at a difficult time for rights activists in Russia&quot;. A cash reward, which comes with the prize, of €50,000 was awarded to Memorial in December 2009.

The writer and historian Irina Scherbakowa, a founder and staff member of Memorial, was given the Ossietzky Award and the Goethe Medal for her work relating to Memorial&#x27;s activities.

In 2009, Memorial HRC was awarded the Victor Gollancz Prize by the Society for Threatened Peoples.

In 2012, Memorial was awarded the Custodian of National Memory prize by the Institute of National Remembrance.

On 4 February 2015, Lech Wałęsa nominated Memorial International for the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.

Memorial was awarded the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize along with Belarusian human rights activist Ales Bialiatski and the Ukrainian human rights organisation Centre for Civil Liberties. Berit Reiss-Andersen, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, stated that the recipients &quot;have made an outstanding effort to document war crimes, human rights abuses and the abuse of power&quot;, however the committee stated that the choice was not made against Putin, who launched an invasion of Ukraine in February of that year.

Memorial also received the 2022 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Democracy Defender Award, jointly with Ukrainian Human Rights Centre ZMINA, for courageous and important efforts to promote human rights and democracy. 

==Recent operations==
===International Memorial===
In April 2021, Memorial researchers Sergei Krivenko and Sergei Prudovsky published a study of the &quot;national&quot; operations conducted by the NKVD during the Great Terror, 1937–1938. Examining the available documents, they noted that the FSB, successor to the NKVD and KGB, had not fulfilled the terms of a June 1992 edict issued by President Boris Yeltsin. This demanded that all legislative acts and other documentation that &quot;served as the basis for mass repressive measures and violations of human rights&quot; should be declassified and made publicly available within three months.
The Great Terror involved &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; and was therefore subject to no statute of limitation. In 1968, the USSR acceded to the UN Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity. Decades later, and thirty years after the 1992 presidential edict, the researchers were filing cases in the courts to pressure regional branches of the FSB to release documents about the Great Terror over 80 years earlier. Krivenko was an academic and a founding member of Memorial, while Prudovsky began by researching the fate of his grandfather and has spent the last ten years on a wide-ranging study of political repression in the 1930s.

===Memorial Human Rights Centre===
The growing list of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in Russia (the Memorial Human Rights Centre issued a list of 377 names on 9 November 2021) reflected the link always drawn by Memorial between past atrocities and present-day violations of human rights. This referred, on the one hand, to hotspots around the Soviet Union and Russia, the two wars in Chechnya, conflicts with neighbouring countries, especially Georgia and Ukraine, and, on the other hand, to the regime within Russia under Vladimir Putin and his administration.

==Persecution ==
In the 1990s, Memorial researchers gained access to central FSB archives and many significant documents about collectivisation, the Gulag and the Great Terror were found and published. Outside the capital, the situation across the country varied considerably. After the third-term re-election of Vladimir Putin in 2012, civil society as a whole and Memorial, in particular, were increasingly out of favour. Memorial&#x27;s chronicling of historic purges frequently conflicted with Putin&#x27;s attempts to venerate Soviet history.
===Confiscation of the digital archive, 2008===

On 4 December 2008, Memorial&#x27;s St. Petersburg office was raided by the authorities. Officers confiscated 11 computer hard disks containing 20 years of research. The information was being used to develop &quot;a universally accessible database with hundreds of thousands of names.&quot; Director Irina Flige thought Memorial was being targeted because it was on the wrong side of Putinism, specifically the idea &quot;that Stalin and the Soviet regime were successful in creating a great country&quot;.

The raid was supposedly related to a xenophobic article in a June 2007 issue of the &quot;Novy Peterburg&quot; newspaper. Memorial denied any link to the publication. Some human rights lawyers in Russia speculated that the raid was a retaliation for the St. Petersburg Memorial screening of the banned film &quot;&quot; (2007), which is about the murder of Russian ex-spy Alexander Litvinenko in Great Britain in 2006.

Allison Gill, director of Human Rights Watch in Moscow, said, &quot;This outrageous police raid shows the poisonous climate for non-governmental organisations in Russia […] This is an overt attempt by the Russian government […] to silence critical voices&quot;. Academics from all over the world signed an open letter to then-President Dmitry Medvedev that condemned the seizure of disks and material. The United States declared itself &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about the raid: State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said, &quot;Unfortunately, this action against Memorial is not an isolated instance of pressure against freedom of association and expression in Russia&quot;.

On 20 March 2009, the city&#x27;s Dzerzhinsky district court ruled that the December 2008 search and confiscation of 12 HDDs were carried out with procedural violations; the actions of law enforcement bodies were illegal. Eventually, the 12 hard drives, plus optical discs and some papers, were returned to Memorial in 2009.

=== Chechnya and the North Caucasus, 1994–2018 ===

Activists linked to Memorial played a key role during the first Chechen conflict (1994–1996) when Russia&#x27;s human rights ombudsman Sergei Kovalyov spent days in Grozny under bombardment by federal aviation. They moved between the two sides of the conflict, searching for the missing and arranging exchanges of those killed during the fighting.

It became much harder for human rights activists to act impartially during the second Chechen conflict (1999–2005). Memorial&#x27;s office in Grozny was frequently raided by the authorities. Memorial activist Natalia Estemirova, a close colleague of the murdered journalist Anna Politkovskaya (1958–2006), investigated murders and abductions in Chechnya until she herself was kidnapped in Grozny and shot dead in neighbouring Ingushetia on 15 July 2009. BBC reporters suggested her death was connected to her investigations of government-backed militias in the country. Three days later, Memorial suspended its activities in Chechnya, stating &quot;We cannot risk the lives of our colleagues even if they are ready to carry on their work.&quot;

Oleg Orlov, a Memorial board member with experience in the North Caucasus, accused Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov of being behind the murder, and claimed that Kadyrov had openly threatened her. Kadyrov denied his involvement and sued Memorial for defamation, naming Orlov specifically in his complaint. Several years later the case was yet to be resolved.

On 17 January 2018, masked arsonists set fire to Memorial&#x27;s North Caucasus office in Nazran, Ingushetia.

=== &quot;Foreign agent&quot; status, 2014–2020 ===

According to the 2012 foreign agent law, &quot;groups must register with the Justice Ministry as “foreign agents” if they receive even a minimal amount of funding from any foreign sources, governmental or private, and engage in &#x27;political activity&#x27;&quot;. The first part of Memorial to be declared a &quot;foreign agent&quot; was its Moscow-based Human Rights Centre in July 2014. The following year, the Ministry of Justice designated the Research &amp; Information Centre at St. Petersburg Memorial, two Memorial organisations in Yekaterinburg and another one in Ryazan &quot;foreign agents&quot;. On 4 October 2016, the law requiring organizations that accepted funds from abroad and engaged in &quot;political activities&quot; to register and declare themselves as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; was applied to Memorial International.

Memorial HRC and International Memorial disputed this designation of their status in the courts and, having exhausted such legal recourse with the Russian judicial system, applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. The Research &amp; Information Centre at Petersburg Memorial declared that it would continue its work and projects but &quot;did not intend to mark all its publications with such a stamp&quot;, designating it a foreign agent. It informed, &quot;all interested persons that RIC Memorial&#x27;s public activities would be continued by the Joffe Foundation&quot;.

In its 2015 annual &quot;foreign agent&quot; audit, Russia&#x27;s Ministry of Justice accused the Memorial Human Rights Centre of &quot;undermining the foundations of the constitutional order of the Russian Federation&quot; and of calling for &quot;a change of political regime&quot; in the country.

Memorial International&#x27;s designation as a &quot;foreign agent&quot; was part of the State&#x27;s ongoing battle with NGOs and civil society. By autumn 2019, Memorial and its new chairman, Yan Rachinsky, faced fines of 3,700,000 roubles for infringing the terms of the foreign agent law: a sum that was raised through crowdfunding. In 2020, Memorial submitted a complaint to the ECHR about excessive fines and harassment.

===Intimidation and order to close, 2021===

On 14 October 2021, around 20 men broke into the Moscow offices of Memorial and interrupted a public film screening of &quot;Mr Jones&quot; with hostile chants. Memorial staff called the police, but by the time the officers arrived most of the intruders had dispersed, and police led away the three who remained. Then, without explanation, the police shut the people who had been watching the film in the Memorial building and held them there for hours, late into the night. Everyone was forced to provide full personal details from their passports, their residential address and phone number, as well as information about their education, workplace, and work title.

The first calls for the closure of Memorial were made in 2014 by Minister of Justice Aleksandr Konovalov in an application to the Supreme Court. If Memorial was closed, commented its chairman Arseny Roginsky, then the organisation&#x27;s many branches would have to re-register and thereafter restore contacts with one another across the country. In January 2015, the Court announced that it would not uphold the Ministry&#x27;s request.
On 11 November 2021, the Russian Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office announced that it had submitted a lawsuit to the Supreme Court, seeking to close Memorial International over violations of the Russian foreign agent law. The following day, it became known that the Moscow City Prosecutor&#x27;s Office filed a lawsuit with the Moscow City Court requesting the closure of the Memorial Human Rights Centre. The lawsuits would be heard on 26 and 23 November, respectively. More than 120,000 people signed a petition to save the group.

On 28 December 2021, the Supreme Court of Russia ordered the International Memorial Society and its regional branches to close because it had violated the 2012 foreign agent law. During the court hearing, state prosecutor Zhafyarov accused Memorial of &quot;creating a false image of the Soviet Union as a terrorist state&quot; and &quot;making us repent for the Soviet past, instead of remembering glorious history […] probably because someone is paying for it&quot;. A lawyer for Memorial said it would appeal against the decision in both Russian courts and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, which has jurisdiction over Russia. The following day, the Moscow City Court announced its decision to shut down the Memorial Human Rights Centre. Video clips covering the harassment, trial, and closure of Memorial are shown in a 2024 documentary, &quot;Of Caravan and the Dogs.&quot;

Like most independent Russian media and rights bodies, Memorial is now &quot;forced to operate outside the country, and some of memorial&#x27;s activists have been jailed. But the body continues to campaign vocally on social media, and the Nobel Prize committee hailed its efforts to document war crimes and other abuses of power.&quot;

In February 2024, Memorial&#x27;s co-chair, Oleg Orlov, was sentenced to two years in prison having been convicted of &quot;repeatedly discrediting&quot; the Russian military.

==International response to the threat of closure==
On 29 December, the UN Human Rights Office in Geneva described the Russian courts&#x27; rulings as &quot;further weaken[ing] the country&#x27;s dwindling human rights community&quot;. This was followed by the application of an emergency interim measure by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), ordering the Russian government to halt the abolition of the two organisations. , both organisations were party to a pre-existing ECHR complaint concerning the Russian foreign agent law.

On 31 December 2021, a joint statement was released by the European Union, the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom criticising the Russian courts&#x27; decisions to shut Memorial and calling on Russia &quot;to uphold its international human rights obligations and commitments&quot;.

<text>The second USS &quot;Alliance&quot; was a screw gunboat that was in service from 1877–1911 with the United States Navy.

Laid down as Huron, a screw gunboat of the third rate, in 1873 at the Norfolk Navy Yard, &quot;Alliance&quot; was launched on 8 March 1875. She was sponsored by Miss Eulalie Boush, whose father, Naval Constructor George R. Boush, was superintending the warship&#x27;s construction. However, before &quot;Huron&quot; joined the fleet, she was renamed Alliance to honor the Revolutionary War frigate. Ultimately, &quot;Alliance&quot; was commissioned on 18 January 1877 with Commander Theodore F. Kane in command.

==Service history==

===1877–1878===
On 25 August 1877, &quot;Alliance&quot; sailed from Smyrna for Salonika in company with Rear Admiral John L. Worden&#x27;s flagship, , and reached that port five days later. She returned to Smyrna, and then again visited Constantinople, where she remained into December. She sailed thence back to Smyrna, the new year 1878 finding her in that port. Having spent eight months in the eastern Mediterranean, &quot;Alliance&quot; sailed for Villefranche in early January 1878, but returned to Smyrna on 24 February, bringing with her quantities of stores to be distributed among the ships of the squadron.

A few hours after &quot;Alliance&quot;″s arrival, arrived at the Piraeus bearing Ulysses S. Grant on his world tour. During ex-President Grant&#x27;s stay, &quot;Alliance&quot; rendered honors to him on 13 March. Less than two weeks later, while she lay at the Piraeus, the ship received the King and Queen of Greece, who, after inspecting the flagship, &quot;remained a considerable time on board&quot; &quot;Alliance&quot;, and departed on 26 March.

Sailing from Havre on 6 August, &quot;Alliance&quot; reached Cherbourg, France, on the 7th, and remained there for a day, before pushing on for Gibraltar on the 9th. She proceeded thence to Villefranche, arriving there on the 19th. After returning to the eastern Mediterranean, visiting Leghorn, Italy, between 20 and 27 September, she sailed on a cruise &quot;in eastern waters, making Smyrna her headquarters.&quot; &quot;Alliance&quot; later visited Messina, Italy and Volo, Turkey; after &quot;finding affairs there (at Volo) quiet,&quot; the gunboat sailed for Smyrna, arriving there on 11 October. &quot;Alliance&quot; remained there into December.

===1878–1904===
In 1879, &quot;Alliance&quot; carried out much the same routine as in her previous time with the European Squadron, returning to the U.S. late in the year. Reaching Boston on 8 December 1879, &quot;Alliance&quot; sailed for Norfolk the following day, arriving there on the 14th. For the next five months, the ship lay under repairs at Norfolk, before she received orders at the end of April 1880, to proceed to the Newfoundland Banks, to &quot;search for and establish positions (if found) of the rocks and shoals&quot; reported by shipping in that area. In 1881, &quot;Alliance&quot; sailed north on an arctic cruise looking for survivors of the &quot;Jeannette&quot; expedition which had been wrecked that summer near the De Long Islands north of Russia. While in the North Atlantic, she stopped in Iceland and reported on the fate of the &quot;Jamestown&quot;, which had run aground in June.

After that the ship found herself in the Caribbean monitoring the Colombian civil war in 1885. That year, she captured the one-gun Colombian privateer brigantine &quot;Ambrose Light&quot;, which was filled with heavily armed sailors and ammunition. &quot;Ambrose Light&quot; was flying a strange flag, so the Americans assumed the ship to be a pirate. The ship was taken as prize but later released.

&quot;Alliance&quot; resumed her activities, training landsmen, soon thereafter, attached to the Atlantic Training Squadron. In 1902, the ship visited Queenstown, Ireland; Lisbon, Portugal; Algiers, and Madeira before undergoing voyage repairs at the Norfolk Navy Yard; subsequently, the ship sailed south to Trinidad, St. Kitts, San Juan, and Jamaica, before arriving back in Hampton Roads on 13 June 1903. In 1904, &quot;Alliance&quot; was among the ships reviewed by President Theodore Roosevelt at Oyster Bay, Long Island, on 17 August 1904.

===1904–1911===
The ship&#x27;s last duty commenced soon thereafter, when she was dispatched to Culebra, Puerto Rico, to serve as station ship and store ship at the naval station there. Regarded as &quot;unserviceable for war purposes&quot;, she was decommissioned at San Juan on 7 July 1911, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 9 August 1911. Her hulk, however, remained in government hands until disposed.

<text>The press gallery is the part of a parliament, or other legislative body, where political journalists are allowed to sit or gather to observe and then report speeches and events. This is generally one of the galleries overlooking the floor of the house and can also include separate offices in the legislative or parliamentary buildings accorded to the various media outlets, such as occurs with the Strangers Gallery in the British House of Commons or the Canberra Press Gallery in the Australian Parliament.

==Overview==
The United States Senate established its first press gallery in 1841, and both the House of Representatives and Senate set aside galleries for reporters when they moved into their current chambers in 1857 and 1859. (The White House did not designate a press room until 1902.) The press galleries in Congress are operated by superintendents, appointed by the House and Senate sergeants at arms, and by Standing Committees of Correspondents, elected by the journalists.

The first Standing Committee of Correspondents was created in 1879 to eliminate lobbyists from the press galleries. With the approval of House and Senate leaders, reporters drafted a set of requirements for accreditation. Press passes were issued only to those whose primary source of income was journalism, and who reported by telegraph to a daily newspaper. The rules eliminated lobbyists, but also women and minorities. Nineteenth-century women reporters were confined to social news coverage, which did not justify the cost of telegraphing. African American reporters were limited to the black press, which were then all weekly papers. Not until the 1940s did women and minorities overcome these obstacles.

In the twentieth century, the same rules denied press passes to radio reporters, unless they simultaneously reported for daily newspapers. In response to complaints from broadcasters, Congress in 1939 created a Radio Gallery in each house, later the Radio-TV galleries. Congress also established a Periodical Press Gallery for magazine and newsletter writers, and a Press Photographers&#x27; Gallery. By the 1990s, Internet reporters and bloggers began applying for press passes. After initial resistance, the press galleries adjusted their rules to admit those who earn their living from their journalism, and who are not underwritten by advocacy groups.

Reporters who occupy the press galleries are known as the press corps. Now numbering in the thousands, they rely on similar press operations in all three branches of the government. Despite the government&#x27;s efforts to accommodate the press corps, however, the relationship between the press and the politicians remains essentially adversarial, punctuated by politicians&#x27; complaints of bias and misrepresentation, and by reporters&#x27; protests against government attempts to manipulate the news.

<text>The Royal Saudi Air Force () (RSAF) is the aviation branch of the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces.

The Royal Saudi Air Force currently has wings, squadrons, and a special forces unit dedicated to combat search and rescue.

The RSAF has developed from a largely defensive military force into one with an advanced offensive capability, and maintains the second largest fleet of F-15 Eagles after the USAF.

The backbone of the RSAF is currently the F-15 Eagle, with the Panavia Tornado also forming a major component. The Tornado and many other aircraft were delivered under the Al Yamamah contracts with British Aerospace (now BAE Systems).

The RSAF ordered various weapons in the 1990s, including Sea Eagle anti-ship missiles, laser-guided bombs and gravity bombs. Al-Salam, a successor to the Al Yamamah agreement will see 48 Eurofighter Typhoons delivered by BAE.

==History==
 The Royal Saudi Air Force was formed in the mid-1920s with British assistance from the remains of the Hejaz Air Force. It was initially equipped with Westland Wapiti IIA general purpose aircraft flown by pilots who had served Ali of Hejaz but had been pardoned by the Saudi king.

Following a contract with the British government, which was concluded in 1937, a military airstrip at Jeddah was established in 1939. The military airstrip was where the Air Force was stationed. In 1949, a group of aviation students were sent to study in England, after completing training at Al-Houba. By 1950, a second group of students were sent. The Air Force was re-organized in 1950 and began to receive American assistance from 1952 including the use of Dhahran Airfield by the United States Air Force. In 1951, the group of aviation students returned to form the Royal Saudi Air Force. 
On November 5, 1952, the Air Force’s flag was raised at a military hangar in Jeddah Airport, which was attended by His Royal Highness Prince Mishaal bin Abdulaziz, Minister of Defense and Aviation at the time. Shortly afterwards, Air Force schools begun opening around the kingdom. Early aircraft used by the RSAF included the Caproni Ca.100, Albatros D.III, Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8, Farman MF.11 Airco DH.9, dH 82 Tiger Moth, Westland Wapiti, Avro Anson, Douglas C-47, and the Douglas B-26 Invader.
In 1957, the Royal Saudi Air Force begun major developments, including the establishments of 5 Squadrons, all based at Jeddah Airport. The transportation squadron was equipped with Douglas C-54 Skymasters and Fokker S-13s. The No.2 Squadron was equipped with Douglas B-26 Invaders and the No.5 Squadron was equipped with 20 De Havilland Vampires.

As part of the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; arms deal between the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia, four single-seat Hawker Hunter F.6s and two Hunter T.7s were ordered from Hawker in 1966. The aircraft were delivered to No. 6 Squadron at Khamis Mushayt Airbase in May 1966. Although the Hunters were operational, following attacks on Saudi Arabia by the Egyptian Air Force they were not a success as interceptors as they lacked any ground control but were used for ground attack. One single-seat aircraft was lost in 1967 and the remaining aircraft were presented to Jordan in 1968.

The Saudi forces are equipped with mainly western equipment. Main suppliers to the RSAF are companies based in the United Kingdom and the United States. Both the UK and the US are involved in training programs conducted in Saudi Arabia.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the armed forces of Saudi Arabia were relatively small by Middle Eastern standards. Its strength however was derived from advanced technology. The backbone of the strike / ground attack force is formed by ca 70 Tornados (a second batch of 48 Tornado IDS were ordered in 1993 under the al-Yamamah II program), and 72 F-15S aircraft delivered from the mid-1990s that operate beside the remnants of more than 120 F-15C/D aircraft delivered starting in 1981. Pilot training is executed on the Pilatus PC-21 and BAE Hawk. The C-130 Hercules is the mainstay of the transport fleet and is assisted by CN-235s and Raytheon King Air 350 light transports. Reconnaissance is performed by Tornadoes and F-15s equipped with the DJRP electro-optical reconnaissance pod. The Boeing E-3A is the Airborne Early Warning platform operated by No. 18 Squadron RSAF.

The VIP support fleet consists of a wide variety of civil registered aircraft such as the Airbus A330, Airbus A320, 737 and 747, Lockheed Tri-Stars, MD11s and G1159A as well as Lockheed L-100-30. The HZ- prefix used in the civilian registrations of these aircraft derived from the former name of the territory (Hejaz).

From 1989 to 1991 three Lockheed C-130 Hercules of the RSAF were destroyed in accidents.

The September 1991 issue of &quot;Air Forces Monthly&quot; lists Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (Tornado IDS), 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 29 Squadron (Dhahran with Tornado ADVs); 34, 37, 42, and 66 Squadrons.

===Purchases during the 2000s===
The Al Yamamah contract was controversial because of the alleged bribes associated with its award. Nonetheless, the RSAF announced its intention to purchase the Typhoon from BAE Systems in December 2005. On 18 August 2006, a memorandum of understanding was signed for 72 aircraft in a GB£6–10 billion deal.

Following this order, the investigation of the Al Yamamah contract was suppressed by the British prime minister Tony Blair in December 2006, citing &quot;strategic interests&quot; of the UK. On 17 September 2007 Saudi Arabia announced it had signed a £4.4bn deal with BAE Systems for 72 Typhoons.

On 29 December 2011, the United States signed a $29.4 billion deal to sell 84 F-15s in the SA (Saudi Advanced) configuration. The sale includes upgrades for the older F-15s up to the SA standard and related equipment and services.

On 23 May 2012, the British defence firm BAE Systems agreed to sell 22 BAE Hawk advanced jet trainer aircraft to the Royal Saudi Air Force for a total of £1.9 billion ($3 billion). The deal also included simulators, ground and training equipment and spares. In April 2013, BAE Systems delivered the first two new Typhoons of 24 to Saudi Arabia.

In 2013, the USAF tendered an offer for security services to protect the Saudi air force from cyberwarfare attacks.

In March 2021, RSAF started a joint military exercise, that will last until April 10, with the US and Pakistani Air Forces that will help in exchanging experiences and expertise.

===Drones===
Saudi Arabia is one of the largest countries that owns unmanned aerial vehicles, including attack, surveillance, and reconnaissance. In 2012, Saudi Arabia purchased 50 Italian Selex Galileo Falco drones. In 2014, Saudi Arabia signed a contract with China to purchase Wing Loong drones, and Saudi Arabia has more to receive so far.

In April 2013, Saudi Arabia announced its desire to buy 6 Turkish TAI Anka drones, however these efforts fell through.

Saudi Arabia has pursued projects to manufacture national drones, the first of which was in 2012, when Saudi Arabia announced a program to manufacture drones in the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology. The project was called Saqr, and 3 new models of the drone have been introduced. Saudi Arabia also announced a new drone called Samoom, the Saudi crown prince showcased the new drone to the Egyptian President Abdul-Fattah As-Sisi during which he showed significant interest in it.

Saudi Arabia also announced in 2021 that it will start producing a high capability drone called SkyGuard. It also established a laboratory for robotic vehicle research at the Prince Sultan Advanced Technology Research Institute at King Saud University. The laboratory aims to build and transfer technology in the field of smart vehicles of all kinds, such as unmanned aircraft, autonomous land vehicles, and others. The laboratory has manufactured many unmanned aircraft, and the aircraft are still undergoing research and development.

Saudi Arabia has started technology transfer projects and joint ventures with countries to manufacture drones. The General organization for Military Industries obtained a license to manufacture the German drone project Luna, manufacturing hundreds of them for the Saudi armed forces. Saudi Arabia also entered a joint venture with South Africa to manufacture the Seeker 400 UCAV.

In 2023, Saudi Arabia and Baykar has signed a contract for AKINCI UCAV export. The amount was not declared but hinted that it is the biggest export at once. SSB President Görgün, who made a statement about the contract in question, said, “The largest Turkish defence industry export, made at once, is over three billion dollars.”

<text>The Gandharvas was a Canadian alternative rock band formed in 1989 in London, Ontario.

==History==
The band formed in 1989 as The Droogs (later The London Droogs), and released a self-titled EP in 1991. They changed their name to The Gandharvas in 1993, after Gandharvas, who are musical spirits in Hinduism.

The band performed live shows in the London area, and in November 1993 signed with the label &quot;Watch Music&quot;. In 1994 the group released their debut album as The Gandharvas, titled &quot;A Soap Bubble and Inertia&quot;. The album included the single &quot;The First Day of Spring&quot;, which was named Song of the Year (CASBY Award) by The Edge 102.1 in Toronto, and was nominated for MuchMusic&#x27;s Video of the Year. &quot;A Soap Bubble and Inertia&quot; entered the Canadian album charts at No. 51 in July 1994 and peaked at No. 39 on August 1, 1994.

In 1995, they released their second album &quot;Kicking in the Water&quot;, and shortly after were signed by major label MCA Records. Their 1997 release, &quot;Sold for a Smile&quot;, included the singles &quot;Downtime&quot; and &quot;Watching the Girl&quot;. All three albums were also released in Japan on the label &quot;Avex DD&quot;.

Though &quot;Sold for a Smile&quot; was a minor commercial success (with the &quot;Downtime&quot; video receiving substantial play at MuchMusic), the album would be the band&#x27;s last, as the grunge/alternative movement of the 1990s faded in popularity. They would announce their breakup in 2000.

Following the break-up of the band, Beau Cook returned to his former band, Smoother. Vocalist Paul Jago became a geologist and moved to Arizona, later forming the band (duo with wife) &quot;SAID DOG&quot;.

<text>Laurie Oakes (born 14 August 1943 in Newcastle, New South Wales) is an Australian former journalist and author. He worked in the Canberra Press Gallery from 1969 to 2017, covering the Parliament of Australia and federal elections for print, radio, and television.

==Early career==
Oakes was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, the son of Wes and Hazel Oakes. His father worked for BHP as an accountant. When Oakes was six years old, his father was transferred to Cockatoo Island, a small island off the coast of Derby, Western Australia, where there was an iron ore mine. He began his schooling at a one-teacher school with only 20–30 children. Oakes later moved back to New South Wales and attended Lithgow High School. He was an editor of the University of Sydney student newspaper &quot;Honi Soit&quot; in 1963. He graduated in 1964 from the University of Sydney while working part-time with the Sydney &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.

At the age of 25 he was the Melbourne &quot;Sun&quot;&#x27;s Canberra Bureau Chief and while working for that paper he began providing political commentaries for the TV program, &quot;Willesee at Seven&quot;. In 1978 he began &quot;The Laurie Oakes Report&quot;, a televised political journal. In 1979 he joined Network Ten and worked there for five years. He has since written about politics for &quot;The Age&quot; in Melbourne and the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; in Sydney. He commentated for several radio stations.

In 1980 he obtained a draft copy of the Australian federal budget before it was delivered in Parliament.

==Later career==
In 1997, Oakes used leaked documents to report on abuse of parliamentary travel expenses, which ended the careers of three ministers, several other politicians and some of their staff. More recently he used leaked documents showing the Rudd Government ignored warnings from four key departments about its Fuelwatch scheme.

Oakes has been a weekly contributor to various Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) owned media outlets, including the former Channel 9 television program, &quot;Sunday&quot;. He has also been a regular reporter for &quot;Nine News&quot;. He wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine until it ceased publication in January, 2008. Oakes then wrote for news.com.au publications until his retirement.

He announced his retirement date as 18 August 2017.

==Personal politics==
In a 2004 interview, Oakes said: &quot;My personal politics are pretty much in the middle, I would think. I&#x27;ve voted both ways at various times. I don&#x27;t know if perceptions about my politics influence whether people will be interviewed. [Paul] Keating used to boycott the program every now and again; not because he thought I was a Liberal but because he thought I wouldn&#x27;t toe the line. Paul believed in rewards and punishment.&quot;

Oakes has been nicknamed the &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; by Crikey.

==Awards==
In 1998 Oakes won the Walkley Award for journalistic leadership, and again in 2001 for television news reporting. He claimed the Gold Walkley in 2010 for his reporting of Labor leaks during the federal election campaign. In 2010, Oakes won the Graham Perkin Australian Journalist of the Year award.

In 2011, Oakes was inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame.

He delivered the 2011 Andrew Olle Media Lecture.

<text>Cam FM (formerly known as Cambridge University Radio and later CUR1350) is a student-run radio station at the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. The station broadcasts online and has an FM frequency of 97.2 MHz. The station opened studios at Anglia Ruskin University and Fitzwilliam College and started broadcasting in 2012 from these locations after having spent its first 32 years located in Churchill College. Cam FM once held the world record for the longest team broadcast marathon, at 76 hours, and following the significant technical overhaul as a result of the two new studios in 2012, provided the first-ever broadcast media coverage of the Oxford vs Cambridge Women&#x27;s Boat Race from Dorney Lake, as well as live outside broadcasts from Newmarket Races and the Varsity Ski Trip.

In March 2009, Cam FM was awarded an FM Community Licence by the UK Broadcasting Regulator Ofcom. The station, then known as CUR1350, took on its current name and launched its FM service on 2 October 2010. The station is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin Student Radio Ltd, which is also the FM licence holder.

Cam FM disaffiliated from the Student Radio Association in 2015, despite once winning Best Station at the Association&#x27;s Student Radio Awards 2007 as CUR1350. However, Cam FM rejoined the Student Radio Association in 2019.

Cam FM is managed by a committee of annually elected students and alumni of the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University. It is transmitted from Cambridge University Library on West Road.

==History==
In early 1979, Simon Cooper, Ellie Buchanan, and David Clouter at the student-run &quot;Cambridge University Broadcasting Society&quot; founded a radio station which was granted permission to install induction loops around the Cambridge colleges of Churchill and later New Hall, allowing residents to listen to Cambridge University Radio (as it was then known) over a short-range, mono, mediumwave broadcast. The station subsequently became &quot;CUR945&quot;.

Despite successfully applying for a number of short-term FM licences, CUR was unable to continuously broadcast to the university community, and so it struggled to achieve widespread popularity.

The explosive growth of the Internet, along with many colleges installing high-speed Ethernet connections in student rooms, prompted the station to launch a simultaneous webcast in 1998. This allowed students from throughout the University to listen whenever they were near a computer. In 2004, the Internet audio webcasts were upgraded, and in 2005, an enhanced online player was launched.

Additionally, in 2002, the station successfully applied for a long-term, low-powered AM licence. Broadcasting on 1350 kHz, the station was then known as CUR1350.

In 2006, CUR1350 launched a project to install a cable service to multiple sites across the University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin. Dubbed &quot;CURintheBAR&quot;, the station was distributed via the universities&#x27; LAN network to receiving units positioned in student bars and cafes, where it was relayed over loudspeakers.

In March 2009, the station was granted an FM Community Radio License by the UK regulator Ofcom to become the only FM radio station targeting members of Cambridge University and Anglia Ruskin University. Regular programmes began on the new frequency of 97.2 FM in October 2010; the station is now rebranded as Cam FM.

Cam FM is financially self-sufficient via on-air and online advertising and a yearly membership fee. Profits are invested back into the station to improve the service for listeners and the experience for station members. The station receives no funding from either the university or any student union.

==Current broadcasts==
Currently, Cam FM broadcasts continuously, with an automated playout system filling the intervals between live broadcasts. During term time, much of the station&#x27;s output is live between the hours of 8am and 1am. Programmes are produced and presented by undergraduate and postgraduate students and alumni at both the University of Cambridge and the Cambridge campus of Anglia Ruskin University. A majority of programmes are specialist music shows (e.g. drum and bass, indie rock, UK garage), though others are aimed at a wider audience (e.g. their breakfast show, theatre/film review show, or local news coverage).

Most of the technology used by Cam FM is developed in-house, such as their automated playout system, computerized playout systems and audio routing in the studio, enabling the station to be built to specification.

==Awards==
Sports coverage earned the station a silver award in the 2003 Student Radio Awards for their annual coverage of the May Bumps. In 2004, the station won four awards:

* Val Mellon, who would be later heard on the national DAB station Core until it ceased broadcast in 2008, won a gold award for &quot;Best Entertainment Show&quot;, as well as a bronze award for &quot;Best Female&quot; &quot;Presenter&quot;.
* A further gold award was presented to the station for &quot;Technical Achievement&quot; in recognition of the station&#x27;s platform-independent webcast system.
* A silver award was given to the station for &quot;Best Sports Programming&quot; for their live coverage of the annual Oxford vs Cambridge rugby union Varsity match.

In 2005, CUR1350 was nominated for four awards. These were:

* &quot;Technical Achievement&quot; - the station was nominated for its wireless internet link coverage of May Bumps 2005,
* &quot;Sports Broadcasting&quot; - Ed Bolton for The Sports Show, including interviews with Chris Eubank,

* &quot;Student Radio Station of the Year&quot;

In 2007, CUR1350 was nominated for an all-time company record of nine Student Radio Awards, making it the most nominated station of 2007:

* &quot;Best Technical Innovation&quot;
* Three for &quot;Best Entertainment Programme&quot; - Charles Lyon&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Breakfast&quot;, Jaine Sykes&#x27; &quot;Rock Paper Scissors&quot;, and Ella Belsham &amp; Alex-James Painter&#x27;s &quot;Morning Glory&quot;),

* &quot;Newcomer of the Year -&quot; Jaine Sykes,
* Two for &quot;Best Female Presenter&quot; - Katherine Godfrey and Jaine Sykes,
* &quot;Student Radio Station of the Year&quot;

Of these, CUR1350 won Bronze in the &quot;Best Entertainment Programme&quot; category with Charles Lyons&#x27; &quot;&quot;Weekend Breakfast&quot;,&quot; Gold for Katherine Godfrey in the &quot;Best Female Presenter&quot; category, and Gold in &quot;Station of the Year.&quot;

* &quot;Best Specialist Music Programme&quot; - Sandy Mill, 
* &quot;Best Outside Broadcast&quot; - The 2008 May Bumps,
* &quot;Best Student Radio Chart Show -&quot; Charles Lyon

Of these, the station won Gold in the &quot;Best Chart Show&quot; category. &quot;Best Student Radio Chart Show&quot; was also a new category as of this year.

In 2009, CUR1350 received two nominations at the Student Radio Awards. These were for:

* &quot;Best Student Radio Chart Show&quot; - Tobias Bown and Simon Ruggles
* &quot;Best Outside Broadcast/Live Event&quot; - The 2009 May Bumps.

In 2012, now known as Cam FM, the station was nominated at the Student Radio Awards for:

* &quot;Best Outside Broadcast/Live Event&quot; - the 2012 May Bumps,
* &quot;Best Speech -&quot; &quot;The Fo&#x27; Show&quot;
* &quot;Student Radio Station of the Year&quot;.

Of these, the station won gold in the &quot;Best Outside Broadcast/Live Event&quot; category.

The Kevin Greening Award is named in honour of the late BBC Radio One presenter whose career in radio started at CUR1350, as it was then known.

==Alumni==

Several of the station&#x27;s members have subsequently achieved considerable success in the wider world of radio &amp; television broadcasting. Notable examples include:
* Kevin Greening, a presenter on BBC Radio 1 throughout the latter half of the 1990s, went on to present on 102.2 Smooth FM, which broadcasts across Greater London, until his untimely death aged 44 in December 2007.
* Matthew Price is now the BBC&#x27;s Europe Correspondent, having previously been BBC&#x27;s New York Correspondent and Middle East Correspondent.
* Spencer Kelly is the presenter of the BBC TV programme Click Online and was formerly a presenter on Ocean FM broadcasting across Portsmouth and Southampton.
* Martin Steers is the Station Manager of NLive Radio in Northampton, the Founder and Chair of the UK National Community Radio Awards, and the Founder and Manager of Scout Radio.

The station once held annual &quot;alumni days&quot;, on which former members were invited back to once again produce and present shows for listeners within the University.

<text>Callirrhoe (; Greek: &quot;Καλλιρρόη&quot;), also known as &#x27;, is one of Jupiter&#x27;s outer natural satellites. It is an irregular moon that orbits in a retrograde direction. Callirrhoe was imaged by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak National Observatory from October 6 through November 4, 1999, and originally designated as asteroid . It was discovered to be in orbit around Jupiter by Tim Spahr on July 18, 2000, and then given the designation &#x27;. It was the 17th confirmed moon of Jupiter.

== Name ==

It was named in October 2002 after Callirrhoe, daughter of the river god Achelous, one of Zeus&#x27;s (Jupiter&#x27;s) many conquests.

== Characteristics ==
Callirrhoe has an apparent magnitude of 20.8, making it even fainter than dwarf planet Eris at magnitude 18.7. Jupiter is about 2.1 billion times brighter than Callirrhoe.\approx 2.13\times10^9&lt;/math&gt;}}

Callirrhoe is about 9.6 kilometers in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24.1 million kilometers in 747.09 days, at an inclination of 141° to the ecliptic (140° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator) with an eccentricity of 0.28. This object was probably captured long ago from a heliocentric orbit and the Sun&#x27;s gravitational influence makes this orbit highly erratic.

It belongs to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 million kilometers, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°. However, while Pasiphae belongs to the grey color class (V=17.22 B−V=0.74, V−R=0.38), Callirrhoe falls under the light red color class (V=21.39 B−V=0.72, V−R=0.50), similarly to Megaclite and Sinope.

== Exploration ==

As a navigation exercise, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft imaged Callirrhoe on January 10, 2007.

<doc id="570406" wikidata="Q1452339" url="?curid=570406" title="Potential output">
<text>In economics, potential output (also referred to as &quot;natural gross domestic product&quot;) refers to the highest level of real gross domestic product (potential output) that can be sustained over the long term. Actual output happens in real life while potential output shows the level that could be achieved.

==Limits to output==
Natural (physical, etc) and institutional constraints impose limits to growth. 

If actual GDP rises and stays above potential output, then, in a free market economy (i.e. in the absence of wage and price controls), inflation tends to increase as demand for factors of production exceeds supply. This is because of the finite supply of workers and their time, of capital equipment, and of natural resources, along with the limits of our technology and our management skills. Graphically, the expansion of output beyond the natural limit can be seen as a shift of production volume above the optimum quantity on the average cost curve. Likewise, if GDP persists below natural GDP, inflation might decelerate as suppliers lower prices in order to sell more products, utilizing their excess production-capacity.

Potential output in macroeconomics corresponds to one point on the production–possibility curve for a society as a whole, reflecting its natural, technological, and institutional constraints.

==Resources utilization==
Potential output has also been called the &quot;natural gross domestic product.&quot; If the economy is said to be at a potential GDP level, the unemployment rate ostensibly equals the NAIRU (the &quot;natural rate of unemployment&quot;). There is great disagreement among economists as to what these rates actually are, while the concept itself of NAIRU is rejected by Post-Keynesians as non-valid.

The difference between potential output and actual output is referred to as output gap or GDP gap; it may closely track lags in industrial capacity utilization.

Potential output has also been studied in relation Okun&#x27;s law as to percentage changes in output associated with changes in the output gap and over time and in decomposition of trend and business cycle in the economy relative to the output gap.

<doc id="570407" wikidata="Q5633400" url="?curid=570407" title="HMS Minerva (F45)">
<text>HMS &quot;Minerva&quot; (F45) was a of the Royal Navy. The ship commissioned in 1966 and took part in the Beira Patrol and Second Cod War during the 1970s and the Falklands War in 1982. Charles, Prince of Wales served aboard the ship in the 1970s. Between these major engagements, the frigate patrolled British territorial waters and took part in NATO and British military exercises. &quot;Minerva&quot; was decommissioned in 1992 and sold for scrap.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Minerva&quot; was ordered during 1962 as the 13th ship of the &quot;Leander&quot;-class. The ship was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 25 July 1963, was launched on 19 December 1964 and commissioned with the Pennant number F45 on 14 May 1966.

&quot;Minerva&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was fitted with Y-136 machinery, built by Vickers at their Barrow-in-Furness works. Two oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. Anti-aircraft defence was provided by a quadruple Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher on the hangar roof, while two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon for close-in defence against surface targets. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Minerva&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried over the ship&#x27;s bridge to direct the 4.5-inch guns, while a GWS22 director for Seacat was mounted on the hangar roof. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 184 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar. While there was provision for a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS), this was not fitted.

From 1975 to 1979, &quot;Minerva&quot; was refitted at Chatham Dockyard where she was converted to the Batch 2 (or Exocet) conversion. The conversion included the removal and replacement of all the ship&#x27;s armament. The Mark 6 4.5-in gun mount was replaced by four Exocet anti-ship missiles. The Limbo anti-submarine mortar was removed to give a larger flight deck and the ship&#x27;s hangar was enlarged to allow a Westland Lynx helicopter to be operated, while two triple STWS torpedo tubes provided short range anti-submarine capability. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of one Seacat launcher mounted forward of the Exocet containers and two more mounted aft on the hangar roof, backed up by two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns on the bridge wings. Type 1006 navigation radar replaced the old Type 974 radar, while the MRS3 gun control director as replaced by a GWS22 director for the forward Seacat launcher, with a second Seacat director mounted aft. Type 184M sonar replaced the main hull sonar, while the VDS was removed and its well plated over. Displacement rose to standard and , with speed falling by two knots.

==Service==
In 1968, &quot;Minerva&quot; deployed to the West Indies during some troubles there, operating from Bermuda. Island hopping was carried out to &quot;show the flag&quot;. In 1970, &quot;Minerva&quot;, like many other British vessels including other &quot;Leander&quot;s, deployed on Beira Patrol, an operation designed to prevent oil from reaching the landlocked Rhodesia via Mozambique, before visiting various ports around Asia and the Pacific. The following year, &quot;Minerva&quot; deployed on her second Beira Patrol which proved relatively quiet.

In November 1972, the Prince of Wales joined &quot;Minerva&quot;. The following year, in February, &quot;Minerva&quot;, along with the Prince, deployed to the Caribbean. While there &quot;Minerva&quot; was involved in a number of exercises, including Exercise &quot;Rum Punch&quot; at Puerto Rico, involving British and American forces. The ship returned to the UK in November. &quot;Minerva&quot; then took part in the Second Cod War, in early 1973. In 1975, &quot;Minerva&quot; returned to the Caribbean, performing a variety of duties there.

Between December 1975 and March 1979, &quot;Minerva&quot; underwent modernisation, including the addition of Exocet missiles. While she was undergoing post refit trials &quot;Minerva&quot; suffered a starboard boiler explosion which destroyed both boiler uptakes forcing her to be towed to Chatham Dockyard for repairs. Following completion of the repairs and refit, &quot;Minerva&quot; became leader of the Fifth Frigate Squadron. On 15 December 1979, a dockyard crane at Devonport Dockyard collapsed in a storm, hitting &quot;Minerva&quot; and the frigate , which was berthed alongside. &quot;Minerva&quot;″s starboard Seacat launcher was wrecked, and her hangar damaged, while &quot;Ambuscade&quot; had one of her boats damaged. In 1980, &quot;Minerva&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean where she carried out exercises with other NATO warships. While there &quot;Minerva&quot; got involved in the Cold War when she shadowed , the nameship of a three-ship class of large aircraft carriers. Between 1978 and 1980 she was commanded by Benjamin Bathurst.

In 1981, &quot;Minerva&quot; was involved in further exercises in the Persian Gulf.

In 1982 during the Falklands War &quot;Minerva&quot; was part of the &#x27;Bristol Group&#x27; and thus joined the war rather late, not reaching the Falkland Islands until 26 May. While there, &quot;Minerva&quot; performed a number of duties, including escort for other vessels. On 1 June 1982 her radar detected an Argentinian C-130 and vectored a flight of patrolling Sea Harriers towards it. The reconnaissance plane was intercepted and shot down. &quot;Minerva&quot; suffered no damage during her deployment during the Falklands War and she returned to Devonport in September, crowds greeting her upon her return.

In November, &quot;Minerva&quot; accidentally rammed the . In late 1984, &quot;Minerva&quot; returned to the South Atlantic on a deployment that encompassed all British South Atlantic territories, a deployment which lasted into 1985. In 1986, &quot;Minerva&quot; completed a brief three-month deployment to the Caribbean. This was followed by BOST at Portland and JMC 863. On 12 January 1987 &quot;Minerva&quot; once again deployed to the South Atlantic as Falklands Guardship including a visit to South Georgia. She was relieved by HMS &quot;Penelope&quot; in May and returned home via the Patagonian Canal visiting Valparaíso, Chile, Lima, Peru, Panama and Florida. She returned home briefly for annual leave on 3 July before returning to sea early August on FCS duties and a further BOST. &quot;Minerva&quot; completed 330 sea days in this year. 1988 was a quieter affair with a short visit to the Mediterranean followed by refit in September 1988. In 1990 as part of the Dartmouth Training Group led by HMS &quot;Bristol&quot;, she completed deployments to the Great Lakes and a global deployment in 1990. On her return and showing her age, &quot;Minerva&quot; was laid up in March 1992, her long and eventful career finally coming to an end. The following year &quot;Minerva&quot; was sold for scrap.

<doc id="570408" wikidata="Q866780" url="?curid=570408" title="Edward S. Herman">
<text>Edward Samuel Herman (April 7, 1925 – November 11, 2017) was an American economist, media scholar and social critic. Herman is known for his media criticism, in particular the propaganda model hypothesis he developed with Noam Chomsky, a frequent co-writer. He held an appointment as Professor Emeritus of finance at the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania. He also taught at Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.

Ideologically, Herman has been described as a &quot;dedicated radical democrat&quot;, an ideology which opposes corporate control in favor of direct democracy while distancing itself from other radical movements. His writings frequently dealt with what he called &quot;Western corporate media reports&quot; on violent regional conflicts, disputing mainstream reports to an extent that he has been criticised for downplaying genocide figures.

== Early life ==
Herman was born in Philadelphia to a liberal Democratic family, the son of Abraham Lincoln Herman, a pharmacist and Celia Dektor, a homemaker.

Herman received a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts from the University of Pennsylvania. At University of California, Berkeley, from which he received his PhD in 1953, he met economist Robert A. Brady, a student of the economics of fascist regimes who had a significant influence upon him. Herman joined the Wharton School of Business of the University of Pennsylvania in 1958, where he taught finance and became professor emeritus in 1989.

== Political views ==
=== Vietnam War ===
Following the Vietnam War, Herman and Noam Chomsky challenged the veracity of media accounts of war crimes and repression by the Vietnamese communists, stating: &quot;the basic sources for the larger estimates of killings in the North Vietnamese land reform were persons affiliated with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or the Saigon Propaganda Ministry&quot; and &quot;the NLF-DRV &#x27;bloodbath&#x27; at Hue (in South Vietnam) was constructed on flimsy evidence indeed&quot;. Commenting on postwar Vietnam, Chomsky and Herman argued: &quot;[i]n a phenomenon that has few parallels in Western experience, there appear to have been close to zero retribution deaths in postwar Vietnam.&quot; This they described as a &quot;miracle of reconciliation and restraint&quot;. In discussing the 1977 Congressional testimony of defecting SRV official Nguyen Cong Hoan, on the subjects of mass repression and the abrogation of civic and religious freedoms, Herman and Chomsky pointed to contradictory accounts of post-war Vietnam, concluding that while &quot;some of what Hoan reports is no doubt accurate ... the many visitors and Westerners living in Vietnam who expressly contradict his claims&quot; suggest &quot;Hoan is simply not a reliable commentator.&quot;

Chomsky and Herman authored &quot;Counter-Revolutionary Violence: Bloodbaths in Fact &amp; Propaganda&quot;, a book which criticised U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia and highlighted how mainstream media neglected to cover stories about these activities; the publisher Warner Modular initially accepted it, and it was published in 1973. However, Warner Modular&#x27;s parent company, Warner Communications, disapproved of the book&#x27;s contents and ordered all copies to be destroyed. According to Jim Neilson&#x27;s book &quot;Warring Fictions: Cultural Politics and the Vietnam War Narrative&quot;, the publication of &quot;Counter-Revolutionary Violence&quot; was stopped by an executive of Warner Publications, William Sarnoff, who thought its discussion of American foreign policy &quot;was a pack of lies, a scurrilous attack on respected Americans, undocumented, a publication unworthy of a serious publisher&quot;. Because of a binding contract, copies were passed to another publisher rather than destroyed.

In 1967, Herman was among more than 500 writers and editors who signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse to pay the 10% Vietnam War tax surcharge implemented by Congress upon the initiation of President Johnson.

=== Cambodia ===

Herman and Chomsky later collaborated on works about the media treatment of post-war Indochina, Cambodia in particular, beginning with &quot;Distortions at Fourth Hand&quot;, an article written for the American left-wing periodical &quot;The Nation&quot; in June 1977. While they did not &quot;pretend to know [...] the truth&quot; about what was going on in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge regime of Pol Pot, they believed, in reviewing material on the topic then available: &quot;[w]hat filters through to the American public is a seriously distorted version of the evidence available&quot;. Referring to what they saw as &quot;the extreme unreliability of refugee reports&quot;, they noted: &quot;Refugees are frightened and defenseless, at the mercy of alien forces. They naturally tend to report what they believe their interlocutors wish to hear. While these reports must be considered seriously, care and caution are necessary. Specifically, refugees questioned by Westerners or Thais have a vested interest in reporting atrocities on the part of Cambodian revolutionaries, an obvious fact that no serious reporter will fail to take into account&quot;. They concluded by stating Khmer Rouge Cambodia might be more closely comparable to &quot;France after liberation, where many thousands of people were massacred within a few months&quot; than to Nazi Germany.

In 1979, Chomsky and Herman revised &quot;Counter-Revolutionary Violence&quot; and published it with South End Press as the two-volume &quot;The Political Economy of Human Rights&quot;. In this work they compared U.S. media reactions to the Cambodian genocide and the Indonesian occupation of East Timor. They argued that because Indonesia was a U.S. ally, U.S. media ignored the East Timorese situation while focusing on that in Cambodia, a U.S. enemy. Volume II of the book &quot;The Political Economy of Human Rights, Volume II: After the Cataclysm: Postwar Indochina and the Reconstruction of Imperial Ideology&quot; (1979), which appeared after the regime had been deposed, has been described by area specialist Sophal Ear as &quot;one of the most supportive books of the Khmer revolution&quot; in which they &quot;perform what amounts to a defense of the Khmer Rouge cloaked in an attack on the media&quot;. In their book, Chomsky and Herman wrote: &quot;The record of atrocities in Cambodia is substantial and often gruesome&quot; but questioned their scale, which may have been inflated &quot;by a factor of 100&quot;. They wrote that the evacuation of Phnom Penh &quot;may actually have saved many lives&quot;, that the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s agricultural policies reportedly produced positive results and there might have been &quot;a significant degree of peasant support for the Khmer Rouge&quot;.

Herman replied to critics in 2001: &quot;Chomsky and I found that the very asking of questions about the numerous fabrications, ideological role, and absence of any beneficial effects for the victims in the anti-Khmer Rouge propaganda campaign of 1975–1979 was unacceptable, and was treated almost without exception as &#x27;apologetics for Pol Pot.

Todd Gitlin, in an email to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote that for Herman and Chomsky &quot;the suffering of the Cambodians is less important than their need to pin the damage done to Cambodia in the 1970s primarily on the American bombing that preceded the rise of the Khmer Rouge to power&quot;.

=== The &quot;propaganda model&quot; ===
Herman and Chomsky&#x27;s best known co-authored book is &quot;Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media&quot;, first published in 1988, and largely written by Herman. The book introduced the notion of the &quot;propaganda model&quot; to the debates on the workings of the corporate media. They argued: &quot;market forces, internalized assumptions and self-censorship&quot; motivate newspapers and television networks to stifle dissent. They wrote: &quot;in our model&quot;, the Polish priest Jerzy Popieluszko (a victim of the Communist state police) &quot;murdered in an enemy state, will be a worthy victim, whereas priests murdered in our client states in Latin America will be unworthy. The former may be expected to elicit a propaganda outburst by the mass media, while the latter will not generate sustained coverage&quot;.

Rather than needing direct control over the media as in dictatorships, in the views of Herman and Chomsky, industrial democracies control popular opinion using &quot;filters&quot; which prevent politically controversial ideas from reaching the public. The two men specified five filters, in particular: the concentration of media ownership to a few corporations, the need to please advertisers and funding sources, the reliance on government-provided sources, flak, and anti-communist ideology. These influences combine to prevent politically inconvenient knowledge and ideas from reaching the general public.

Historian Walter LaFeber, reviewing the original 1988 edition for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, thought &quot;their argument is sometimes weakened by overstatement&quot; citing Herman and Chomsky&#x27;s attack on major American news sources for reproducing false government assertions about Nicaragua but failing to note that those same sources quickly attacked the government when the deliberate error was discovered. Derek N. Shearer, also in 1988 for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, described the work as &quot;important&quot; and the &quot;case studies&quot; as &quot;required reading&quot; for foreign correspondents but in his view the authors &quot;don&#x27;t adequately explore the extent to which the mass media fail to manufacture consent, and why this might be so&quot;. To support his point, Shearer used the examples of the Contras in Nicaragua and the deposed Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, both supported by the US government and conservatives but not by American public opinion. Shearer also commented Herman and Chomsky &quot;persuasively demonstrate that in countries where the American government is involved—either openly or covertly—the press is frequently less than critical, and sometimes a partner in outright deception of the American public.&quot;

&quot;The whole approach of the book is deeply simplistic&quot;, according to Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and communications at Columbia University. &quot;If you think that &quot;The New York Times&quot; is &quot;Pravda&quot;, which is essentially what they&#x27;re saying, then what vocabulary do you have left for Fox News? Their model is so clumsy that it disables you from distinguishing between a straight-out propaganda network and a more complex, hegemonic mainstream news organ&quot;.

=== Writings on Srebrenica ===
Herman wrote about the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in articles such as &quot;The Politics of the Srebrenica Massacre&quot;. He wrote: &quot;the evidence for a massacre, certainly of one in which 8,000 men and boys were executed, has always been problematic, to say the least&quot; and &quot;the &#x27;Srebrenica massacre&#x27; is the greatest triumph of propaganda to emerge from the Balkan wars... the link of this propaganda triumph to truth and justice is non-existent&quot;. He criticized the validity of the term genocide in the case of Srebrenica, alleging inconsistencies in the case of organized extermination such as the Bosnian Serb Army&#x27;s bussing of Muslim women and children out of Srebrenica. In a 2004 review of Samantha Power&#x27;s &quot;&quot;A Problem from Hell&quot;: America and the Age of Genocide&quot;, Herman wrote: &quot;It is truly Orwellian to see the [UN] Yugoslavia Tribunal struggling to pin the &#x27;genocide&#x27; label on Milosevic and to have done that already against Bosnian Serb General Radislav Krstic.&quot; Krstić was convicted of aiding genocide for his role in the Srebrenica massacre and is serving 35 years for those charges.

Marko Attila Hoare criticized Herman&#x27;s position on the Srebrenica massacre, claiming the Srebrenica Research Group was formed &quot;to propagate the view that the Srebrenica massacre never happened&quot;. Michael F. Bérubé said the SRG is dedicated to overturning the findings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Herman&#x27;s writings on the Srebrenica massacre were criticized by John Feffer and Oliver Kamm, who accused him in 2013 of &quot;using bogus statistics for years&quot;, Martin Shaw who said he was &quot;mediating denial&quot;, and the website Balkan Witness which accused him of &quot;insulting the survivors&quot;. Starting from year 2000, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia physically exhumed 8372 bodies of most of the Srebrenica massacre victims, which were then examined and most of identified by DNA analysis, confirming the fact of execution and its scale.

=== &quot;The Politics of Genocide&quot; ===

In &quot;The Politics of Genocide&quot; (co-authored by David Peterson, with a foreword by Noam Chomsky, 2010), Herman and Peterson argue &quot;genocide&quot; has become a politicized notion through analysis of the media and comparative studies of what they title &quot;constructive&quot; and &quot;nefarious&quot; genocides. They argue the Kosovo War, the Rwandan genocide in 1994, and the War in Darfur have been publicized as “genocides” in the West to advance an economic and intellectual agenda. They contrast media coverage of these events with Sanctions against Iraq and the Iraq War, arguing that despite similar casualties to those massacres which receive the label genocide, massacres in which Western powers were directly involved are not labelled “genocides”. By analyzing cases where the term &quot;genocide&quot; has been used, Herman argues the West has leveraged human rights abuses to advance its own agenda. He says this has resulted in a minority controlled government of pro-Western and pro-business Tutsi, while leading to the dismissal of Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) complicity in Central African mass killings during and following the Rwandan Civil War, bringing up evidence of RPF atrocities from sources such as the Gersony Report and the work of Allan C. Stam. &quot;Genocides&quot;, such as East Timor, for which the West has some responsibility, have been largely ignored.

Journalists John Pilger and Dan Kovalik, recommended &quot;The Politics of Genocide&quot;. The book also received negative critical reactions, accusing the authors of denialism, from writers Gerald Caplan, George Monbiot, and James Wizeye, first secretary at the Rwandan High Commission in London. Genocide scholar Adam Jones criticized the account of the Rwandan genocide as &quot;radically revisionist&quot; if not &quot;fantasist&quot;.

== Private life ==
Herman was married to Mary Woody, who died in 2013, for 67 years. He married long-time friend Christine Abbott in 2015.

===Death===
Herman died from complications of bladder cancer in Penn Valley, Pennsylvania, on November 11, 2017, at age 92.

<text>The Eurojet EJ200 is a military low-bypass turbofan used as the powerplant of the Eurofighter Typhoon. The engine is largely based on the Rolls-Royce XG-40 technology demonstrator, which was developed in the 1980s. The EJ200 is built by the EuroJet Turbo GmbH consortium. The EJ200 is also used in the Bloodhound LSR supersonic land speed record attempting car.

==Development==

===Rolls-Royce XG-40===

Rolls-Royce began development of the XG-40 technology demonstrator engine in 1984. Development costs were met by the British government (85%) and Rolls-Royce.

On 2 August 1985, Italy, West Germany and the UK agreed to go ahead with the Eurofighter. The announcement of this agreement confirmed that France had chosen not to proceed as a member of the project. One issue was French insistence that the aircraft be powered by the Snecma M88, in development at the same time as the XG-40.

===Eurojet EJ200===
The Eurojet consortium was formed in 1986 to co-ordinate and manage the project largely based on XG-40 technology. In common with the XG-40, the EJ200 has a three-stage fan with a high pressure ratio, five-stage low-aspect-ratio high-pressure (HP) compressor, a combustor using advanced cooling and thermal protection, and single-stage HP and LP turbines with powder metallurgy discs and single crystal blades. A reheat system (afterburner) provides thrust augmentation. The variable area final nozzle is a convergent-divergent design.

==== EJ200 Mk100 ====
In December 2006, Eurojet completed deliveries of the 363 EJ200s for the Tranche 1 Eurofighters.

==== EJ200 Mk101 ====
Tranche 2 aircraft require 519 EJ200s. , Eurojet was contracted to produce a total of 1,400 engines for the Eurofighter project.

===Landspeed record attempt===
An EJ200 engine, together with a rocket engine, will power the Bloodhound LSR for an attempt at the land speed record. The target speed is at least 1000 mph.

=== Failed bids / cancelled programmes ===

==== EJ230 - HAL Tejas ====
In 2009, Eurojet entered a bid, in competition with the General Electric F414, to supply a thrust vectoring variant of the EJ200 to power the Indian HAL Tejas Mk2 after both the indigenous Kaveri engine and the General Electric F404 used in prototypes and early production models proved to have insufficient performance. After evaluation and acceptance of the technical offer provided by both Eurojet and GE Aviation, the IAF preferred the EJ200 as it is lighter and more compact but after the commercial quotes were compared in detail GE Aerospace was declared as the lowest bidder. A second consideration by HAL was industrial offsets: if local Eurojet engine production was set up for the Tejas it would make future Eurofighter aircraft bids to India cheaper and more competitive with the Tejas whereas it was assumed the US would not allow aircraft using the engine to be sold to India. However, in October 2020 Boeing offered to sell F/A-18 aircraft to the Indian Navy which uses the same GE F414 engine.

==== TAI TFX ====

On 20 January 2015 ASELSAN of Turkey and Eurojet Turbo GmbH signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on the EJ200 military turbofan engine programme. It was envisaged that the collaboration would produce a derivative of the EJ200 with thrust vectoring for use in Turkey&#x27;s TFX 5th generation air superiority fighter programme. However, the Eurojet EJ200 was not selected for the TFX program. Instead, the TFX will use the General Electric F110 engine until indigenous manufacture by TEI and TRMOTOR.

==== KAI KF-21 Boromae ====
The EJ200 was one of the two possible engine options (the other was the GE F414) for the C103 design for the KF-21 (formerly KF-X) programme, but the Republic of Korea Air Force chose the F414-only C109 design.

==== Liquid fly-back booster ====
The Liquid fly-back booster programme was cancelled.

== Variants ==

===EJ2x0===
Stage 1:
* The EJ2x0 with 20% growth compared to the original EJ200. The EJ2x0 engine will have dry thrust increasing to some 72 kN (or 16,200 lbf) with a reheated output of around 103 kN (or 23,100 lbf).
Stage 2:
* The new engine plans to increase the output 30% more power compared to the original EJ200. The engine will have dry thrust of around 78 kN (or 17,500 lbf) with a reheated output of around 120 kN (or 27,000 lbf).

<text>North Seattle College (NSC or North Seattle) is a public college in Seattle, Washington. It is one of three colleges comprising the Seattle Colleges District and part of the Washington Community and Technical Colleges system.

Founded in 1970, NSC is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, and offers associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, university transfer, and certificate programs, as well as continuing education and college preparation programs.

In March 2014, the board of trustees of the Seattle Community Colleges District voted unanimously to change the name of the district to &quot;Seattle Colleges&quot; and North Seattle Community College became &quot;North Seattle College&quot;.

==Academics==
NSC programs include academic degrees, college prep and transfer, cross-disciplinary, continuing and senior adult education programs. NSC is also home to the Watch Technology Institute, the only two-year program in the art of Swiss watchmaking and technology in the western United States.
NSC also provides Running Start, where high school juniors and seniors can take college classes to earn high school credits as well as college credits.

Since 2010, as part of a new Washington State educational initiative, North Seattle College began offering Bachelor of Applied Science (BAS) degree programs to students that have previously completed a two-year degree.

==Campus==
The North Seattle College main campus occupies , including of environmentally sensitive wetlands, in the Licton Springs/North College Park neighborhood of the Northgate district of Seattle. Located at 9600 College Way North, the campus is north of the city center and is easily accessed from Interstate 5, several King County Metro bus routes, and Northgate Station of the Link 1 Line via a dedicated pedestrian bridge over I-5.

NSC campus consists of various academic, athletics &amp; supporting facilities:

*The college&#x27;s library was founded in 1970; as of 2017, it contains over 174,000 volumes (books, media, serials) in the physical and digital collection, along with 40 plus databases that provide access to many thousands of scholarly, popular, trade, and newspaper articles.
*The Computer Lab facilities &amp; laboratories
*North Seattle Indoor Arena, Physical Education, gymnasium, fitness &amp; wellness center
*NSC Bookstore
*NSC Art Gallery

===Wetlands===
The North Seattle College Wetlands sit at the South Fork of Thornton Creek and are important ecological lands for the Thornton Creek watershed as they work as a sponge to hold surge flows of water as well as filtering out pollutants. The wetlands serve as a critical habitat for many species including the Pacific Tree Frog and Long-toed salamander, as well as several species of avian and plant life.

Currently, there is a system of crude trails that get you to and through most of the wetlands habitat. The main trail is a loop that walks around the northern part of campus. There are spurs that branch off of this main loop trail. An interpretive trail is in progress and a map is available with points of interest for those wishing to explore the wetlands further.

A wide variety of native and non-native plant species can be observed throughout the main campus and surrounding wetlands habitat.
There are many mushrooms growing in and around the wetlands. Some notable species include Redlead Roundhead (&quot;Stropharia aurantiaca&quot;), Harefoot Mushroom (&quot;Coprinopsis lagopus&quot;), Fiber Caps (&quot;Inocybe mixtilis&quot;), Shaggy Parasol (&quot;Chlorophyllum olvieri&quot;), and Bellybutton Hedgehog (&quot;Hydnum umbilicatum&quot;).

Wetlands shrub life includes Snowberry Shrubs (&quot;Symphoricarpos albus&quot;), Himalayan Blackberry (&quot;Rubus discolor&quot;), Burning Bush (&quot;Eunonymus alatus&quot;), and Nootka Rose &quot;(Rosa Nutkana&quot;). Campus and wetlands are also home to many plants such as Sumac (&quot;Rhus Species&quot;), Yarrow (&quot;Achillea millefolium&quot;), Sword Fern (&quot;Polystichum munitum&quot;), and Common Horsetail (&quot;Equisetum arvense&quot;).

<doc id="570420" wikidata="Q2865387" url="?curid=570420" title="Arthur Wharton">
<text>Arthur Wharton (28 October 1865 – 12 December 1930) was a British footballer. He is widely considered to be the first black professional footballer in the world. Though not the first black player outright – the amateurs Robert Walker, of Queen&#x27;s Park, and Scotland international player, Andrew Watson, predate him (possibly a professional before Arthur Wharton for Bootle F.C. in 1887) – Wharton may have been the first black professional and the first to play in the Football League.

==Early life, ancestry and early career==
Wharton was born in Jamestown, Gold Coast (now part of Accra, Ghana). His father Henry Wharton was a Grenadian missionary of Scottish and West African descent, while his mother, Annie Florence Egyriba was a member of the Fante Ghanaian royalty. Wharton moved to England in 1882 at age 19, to train as a Methodist missionary, but soon abandoned this in favour of becoming a full-time athlete.

He was an all-round sportsman – in 1886, he equalled the amateur world record of 10 seconds for the 100-yard sprint in the AAA championship. He was also a keen cyclist and cricketer, playing for local teams in Yorkshire and Lancashire. However, Wharton is best remembered for his exploits as a footballer; while he was not the first mixed-heritage footballer in the United Kingdom — leading amateurs Robert Walker and Scotland international Andrew Watson predate him, however Wharton was the first mixed-heritage footballer to turn professional.(but also Arthur Wharton has suffered from discrimination leaving him scared.)

== Football career ==

Wharton started as an amateur playing as a goalkeeper for Darlington F.C., where he was spotted by Preston North End after playing against them. He joined them as an amateur, and was part of the team that reached FA Cup semi-finals in 1886–87. During the third round victory against Renton, Wharton&#x27;s clean sheet was described by Athletic News as &quot;one of the best exhibitions of goalkeeping I have seen for a long time.&quot; Though part of &quot;The Invincibles&quot; of the 1880s, he left Preston in 1888 to concentrate on his running, and thus was not part of the team that subsequently won the Double in 1888–89.

In 1888 the Sheffield Football Association agreed to give a testimonial to Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s Billy Mosforth, versus Preston North End. The meeting of both clubs in the FA Cup meant that the match was postponed until February, by which point the Olive Grove was snow covered and the match was switched to Bramall Lane. Arthur volunteered for the &#x27;Sheffield Wednesday and District&#x27; team but despite both clubs being locked into a draw in the first half Preston ran away with the match, winning 8–1. It was reported that Wednesday&#x27;s heavy loss was &quot;in great measure owing to the wretched performance of Wharton, who utterly failed to uphold his high reputation as a goalkeeper&quot; and that he &quot;could not have stopped the ball had it been half as big as a balloon&quot;. It was reported that at times the Wednesday fans applauded every kick Arthur took and one fan angrily asked the Preston team where they had &quot;brought him from&quot; as it was well known that Arthur was a former Preston player. There were even fears that Arthur would be the victim of violence as he left the field. Arthur did have a connection to Sheffield Wednesday, through his trainer in Sheffield &#x27;Billy&#x27; South, who amongst other noted Sheffield sporting icons of the day also trained Wednesday&#x27;s Tommy Crawshaw.

Having failed to impress at Sheffield Wednesday he returned to football in 1889, joining Rotherham Town, signing as a professional. In 1890 he married Emma Lister (1866–1944) at Rotherham in Yorkshire. By 1891 he was the landlord of the Albert Tavern in Rotherham. In 1894 he moved to Sheffield United, though he was understudy to regular first-team goalkeeper William &quot;Fatty&quot; Foulke. During the 1894–95 season, Wharton played three games for Sheffield United, against Leicester Fosse, Linfield and Sunderland — the latter being a First Division game, making Wharton the first mixed-heritage player to play in the top flight. In 1895 he left for Stalybridge Rovers but after falling out with the management moved to Ashton North End in 1897, where he opened a tobacconist shop in Ashton-under-Lyne. Ashton North End went bankrupt in 1899, and he returned to Stalybridge Rovers, playing with a young Herbert Chapman, before seeing out his career playing for Stockport County of the Second Division in 1901–02. As well as playing in goal, he would also occasionally feature outfield as a winger.

==Legacy==

Having developed a drinking problem, Wharton retired from football in 1902 and found employment as a colliery haulage worker at the Yorkshire Main Colliery in Edlington. By 1911 he was employed as a collier and living in Moorthorpe, West Yorkshire, with wife Emma. When World War I began in 1914 Wharton joined the Volunteer Training Corps (roughly equivalent to the Home Guard of World War II), volunteering to give his life in defence of Britain if called upon. On his death in 1930 he was buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave. The grave was given a headstone in 1997 after a campaign by anti-racism campaigners Football Unites, Racism Divides. In 2003 Wharton was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of the impact he made on the game. A campaign to have a statue erected in Darlington as well as in Rotherham to acknowledge Wharton&#x27;s achievements has gained wide support within the professional game. In 2012, a small statue of Wharton was presented to Sepp Blatter at the headquarters of FIFA, where it will be on permanent display. On 16 October 2014, a statue honouring Wharton was unveiled at St George&#x27;s Park National Football Centre.

In 2020, a mural was unveiled in Darlington on Arthur Wharton&#x27;s 155th anniversary.

Seattle Central College also encompasses the Wood Construction Center and Seattle Maritime Academy, which are on separate campuses to house the very specific tools and workspaces needed.

==History==

Seattle Central&#x27;s origins can be traced to 1902, with the opening of Broadway High School. It operated as a traditional high school until the end of World War II, when it was converted to a vocational and adult education institution for the benefit of veterans who wanted to finish high school. As a result, in 1946, its high school students were all transferred to Lincoln High School, and the Edison Technical School (which already shared a campus with Broadway High) was expanded to fill the entire facility.

Edison started offering college-level courses when it was reconstituted as &quot;Seattle Community College&quot; in September 1966. North Seattle Community College and South Seattle Community College opened their doors in 1970, whereupon Seattle Community College was renamed Seattle Central Community College.

In March 2014, the Seattle Community Colleges District Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the District to Seattle Colleges and to change the names of the colleges to &quot;Seattle Central College&quot;, &quot;North Seattle College&quot; and &quot;South Seattle College&quot;. The decision followed similar decisions by nine other Washington state community colleges that had recently started to offer baccalaureate degrees.

==Campus==

Seattle Central College is an urban campus on Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill, located along its main thoroughfare, Broadway, and west of Cal Anderson Park. The college occupies 10 buildings. Its main structure is the five-story Broadway-Edison Building, which stands south of the four-story Science and Math Building. West of the Broadway-Edison building stand the four-story Mitchell Activity Center, a bookstore, and on-campus apartments for international students; south stand the three-story Broadway Performance Hall, the South Plaza, and the five-story Fine Arts Building. Other structures in the southern part of the campus include a three-story South Annex, Erickson Theater, and Siegal Center (the Seattle Colleges District headquarters). There is also a four-story parking garage just west of the Broadway Performance Hall.

In addition to its campus, the college owns several parcels between Pine and Pike streets.

==Academics and programs==

=== Academic degrees ===
Seattle Central College offers two accredited bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, a Bachelor of Applied Science in Applied Behavioral Science, and a Bachelor of Applied Science in Allied Health. The applied nature of the degrees places increased emphasis on teaching practical skills, versus theory. In addition, two-year associate&#x27;s degrees are offered that comply with Washington&#x27;s Direct Transfer Agreement (DTA). The DTA guarantees that all credits taken will be accepted for transfer to any state university in Washington for completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree at that institution for persons wanting to pursue a B.A. or B.S. outside of Seattle Central.

===Basic studies===
Seattle Central&#x27;s Basic Studies Division offers ESL training to non-native speakers to achieve English proficiency, as well as a GED preparation and testing program.
===Vocational training===
Seattle Central College&#x27;s Seattle Maritime Academy provides students aspiring to enter the U.S. Merchant Marine with STCW training, through two different programs, each requiring about one year to complete. The Marine Deck Technology program teaches skills designed to prepare students to qualify for an Able Seaman–Special rating, while the Marine Engineering Technology program prepares students to qualify as a marine electrician or junior engineer. Both programs culminate in a 60-day at-sea internship aboard a large commercial ship. The academy operates its own 82-foot vessel, &quot;Maritime Instructor&quot; (formerly USCGC &quot;Point Divide&quot;), for instructional purposes.

The college&#x27;s Seattle Culinary Academy offers a five quarter certificate program in Specialty Desserts and Breads, and a six quarter certificate program in Culinary Arts. Both are accredited by the American Culinary Federation.

Seattle Central&#x27;s Wood Technology Center offers three certificate programs (carpentry, cabinet making, and marine carpentry) ranging in length from four to six quarters.

Other vocational training offered by Seattle Central includes information technology and graphic design programs. A two-year Associate of Science in Nursing is offered to prepare students to become registered nurses.

==Student life==

===Mitchell Activity Center===
The Mitchell Activity Center is an 85,000 square foot athletic facility constructed in 1996. It includes racquetball and squash courts, gymnasiums, a strength training facility, and a game room, and is accessible to full-time students for an annual membership fee of $92, and to faculty and staff for a fee of $60. Persons not affiliated with the college can purchase an annual membership for $540.

===Student publications===
&quot;The City Collegian&quot; was Seattle Central College&#x27;s award-winning biweekly student newspaper, published continuously from 1966 until 2008. In that year, college administrators shut it down and cancelled journalism classes after controversial articles by student journalists embarrassed the administrators, prompted student protests, and incurred administrative hostility toward the journalists and their publication. The paper&#x27;s faculty adviser, Jeb Wyman, resigned to protest administrative actions. &quot;The City Collegian&quot; returned to print as &quot;New City Collegian&quot; on June 5, 2012. Written by Seattle Central students, the publication was sponsored by a local business, Cupcake Royale, and received no funding from the college. It has since ceased publication. A magazine, &quot;The Central Circuit&quot;, was established in 2011 and published several times a year. It was the only student publication funded by the college until it suspended publication in 2016 due to the lack of an advisor.

Since 2018, Seattle Central College&#x27;s newspaper has continued in the form of The Seattle Collegian.

<text>The martinet () is a punitive device traditionally used in France and other parts of Europe. The word also has other usages, described below.

==Object==

A martinet is a short, scourge-like (multi-tail) type of whip made of a wooden handle of about in length and about 10 lashes of equal, relatively short length. The lashes are usually made of leather, but sometimes soap-stiffened cords are used in place of leather. It was a traditional instrument of physical punishment in France and other European countries. In French, it also refers to a similar dusting implement; the type for chastisement was also known as &quot;fouet d&#x27;enfant&quot;, meaning &quot;child&#x27;s whip&quot;. The lashes are light, so they are ineffective unless the child is whipped naked. The advantage is they give a stinging pain on bare skin, but will not cause an injury.

The martinet was often applied on the calves, so that the children did not have to disrobe. Otherwise it was usually applied on the bare buttocks, adding humiliation to the physical pain, like the English and Commonwealth caning, birching, naval cat o&#x27; nine tails, American paddling, et cetera.

Around 1962, annual production in France was estimated at 300,000 per year. Approximately 33-50% of French households were estimated to currently or formerly own a martinet.

It is now considered abusive to use a martinet to punish children. However, martinets were still sold in the pet section of French supermarkets. Many believe that a large share of those sold are meant for use on children, not pets, or at least to threaten them. Nowadays, however, many supermarkets in France have stopped selling the martinet, even in the pet section. 

The martinet is also used as an implement in erotic spanking scenes, hard to distinguish from the flogger, but which is usually lighter.

==Person==
===In French===
The term was used for an external pupil of a &quot;collège&quot; (i.e., a kind of French high school, especially Catholic). Jean Bodin, quoting the examination of three witches by Paolo Grillandi of Castiglione at the Castello San Paolo, Spoleto, in his writings about demonology records that the witches referred to the Devil as &quot;Master Martinet&quot; (&quot;Maître Martinet&quot;), or the &quot;Little Master&quot; (&quot;Petit maître&quot;).

===In English===
In English, the term &quot;martinet&quot; usually refers not to the whip but to those who might use it: those who demand strict adherence to set and mete out punishment for failing to follow them. This sense of the word is reputedly derived from the name of Jean Martinet, Inspector General of the army of Louis XIV, such that its relationship to the word&#x27;s earlier sense is merely coincidental.

In an extended sense, a martinet is any person who believes strict adherence to rules and etiquette is paramount. Martinets often use etiquette and other rules as an excuse to trump ethics, to the point that etiquette loses its ethical ground. In 1977, &quot;Time&quot; magazine famously referred to the Ugandan dictator Idi Amin as a &quot;strutting martinet&quot;.

==Other uses==
A French homonym, from the bird name &quot;Martin&quot; and suffix -et, is the swift. 
== Etymology ==

In French, martinet also means a type of hammer, a diminutive of &quot;marteau&quot; (from Latin &quot;martulus&quot;, &quot;little hammer&quot;).

<doc id="570428" wikidata="Q644149" url="?curid=570428" title="One Million Years B.C.">
<text>One Million Years B.C. is a 1966 British adventure fantasy film directed by Don Chaffey. The film was produced by Hammer Film Productions and Seven Arts, and is a remake of the 1940 American fantasy film &quot;One Million B.C.&quot;. The film stars Raquel Welch and John Richardson, set in a fictional age of cavemen and dinosaurs existing together. Location scenes were filmed on the Canary Islands in the middle of winter, in late 1965. The UK release prints of this film were printed in dye transfer Technicolor. The U.S. version released by 20th Century Fox was cut by nine minutes, printed in DeLuxe Color, and released in 1967.

Like the original film, this remake is largely ahistorical. It portrays dinosaurs and humans living at the same point in time; according to the geological time scale, the last non-avian dinosaurs became extinct 66 million years ago, and modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) did not exist until about 300,000 years B.C. Ray Harryhausen, who animated all of the dinosaur attacks using stop-motion animation techniques, commented on the U.S. &quot;King Kong&quot; DVD that he did not make &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; for &quot;professors...who probably don&#x27;t go to see these kinds of movies anyway.&quot;

==Plot==
Men of the dark-haired Rock tribe, led by chief Akhoba, who is accompanied by his rivalrous sons, Tumak and Sakana, capture and kill a warthog and return to share it with the rest of the tribe. Tumak and Akhoba fight over the meat, and Akhoba banishes Tumak to the harsh desert. After surviving several encounters with various prehistoric creatures, Tumak collapses on a remote beach and is spotted by Loana and other women of the fair-haired Shell tribe. Joined by some of the men from the tribe, Loana rescues Tumak from an &quot;Archelon&quot; which is driven into the sea. Tumak is taken to the Shell tribe&#x27;s village where he discovers they are more civilized and advanced than the Rock Tribe.

Back at the Rock tribe, Sakana tries to seize power by killing Akhoba. Akhoba survives, but is a broken man as Sakana becomes the new leader.

With the Shell tribe, Tumak rescues a small girl from an attack by an &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, endearing him to Loana. However, Tumak is banished from the village after he fights Shell tribe member Ahot for possession of the spear Tumak used to fight the creature. Loana decides to accompany Tumak, and Ahot surrenders the spear to Tumak in a gesture of good will. Tumak, with Loana in tow, wanders back to the Rock Tribe camp, but again, there are altercations. They eventually witness an epic fight between a &quot;Triceratops&quot; and a &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; after they encountered and are chased by one of them. The most dramatic fight is a fight between Tumak&#x27;s current love interest Loana and his former lover Nupondi. Loana wins the fight but refuses to strike the killing blow, despite the encouragement from the other members of the tribe. Sakana resents Tumak&#x27;s and Loana&#x27;s attempts at incorporating Shell tribe ways into their culture. While the Rock tribe is swimming, a female &quot;Pteranodon&quot; attacks and snatches Loana to feed her to her offspring. However, a &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; intervenes and a fight ensues. Loana is dropped into the sea and makes it to shore. At first, Tumak mistakenly believes Loana is dead, but they are soon reunited.

Sakana leads a group of like-minded fellow hunters in an armed revolt against Akhoba. Tumak, Ahot and Loana, and other members of the Shell tribe arrive and join the fight against Sakana. In the midst of the battle, a volcano suddenly erupts. Members of both tribes are killed by either the effects of the volcano, or by their attackers. Sakana is speared to death and Akhoba is crushed by falling rock. Tumak, Loana, and the surviving members of both tribes emerge from the desolation and jointly set off to find a new home, with Tumak as the new leader.

==Production==

The exterior scenes were filmed on Lanzarote and Tenerife in the Canary Islands in the middle of winter. The film features the &quot;Echium wildpretii&quot; plant, as a homage to Tenerife&#x27;s unique endemic flora. However, the plants are set in scenes filmed on the Lanzarote beach. In actuality, this plant only flowers from May to June, and never in the time frame of the filming. It is found in Tenerife mountain zones higher than . As a conclusion , the endemic plants featured in the movie were plastic replacements.
As there were no active volcanoes in the Canary Islands, the studio had to construct a 6–7 ft (2-metre) high volcano on the Associated British Picture Corporation&#x27;s studio back lot. The eruption, lava explosions and lava flows were composed of a mixture of wallpaper paste, oatmeal, dry ice and red dye. Harryhausen filmed the dinosaur visuals in his personal studio in London.

As the Shell people are attacked by a giant turtle, the women call it &quot;Archelon&quot; which is the real scientific name for the animal. The film uses six live creatures: a vulture, a python, a green iguana, a warthog, a Loaghtan and a tarantula (a cricket can be seen at the tarantula&#x27;s side). Ray Harryhausen was asked repeatedly about these unanimated creatures, and he confessed they were his idea. At the time, he felt the use of real creatures would convince the audience that all of what they were about to see was indeed real.

Shortly after, Tumak encounters a dinosaur skeleton, which helped build audience anticipation for further dinosaur encounters. This supposedly massive skeleton was actually only about 12 inches in length, made of plaster and shot against a blue backing and matted into the foreground.
The scene where the young &quot;Allosaurus&quot; attacks the village is similar to one in the original film. Shortly after the creature appears it plucks a man out of the water. They used an actor suspended on wires and Harryhausen positioned an animated model man over the actor, on the rear projection plate; thus it seemed as if the live actor was being eaten. Another technically complex scene in this part of the film was when a man fighting the young &quot;Allosaurus&quot; is trapped under a shelter: the dinosaur grabs a support and collapses it. The team used a full-size shelter rigged to collapse at that point during the action. Harryhausen then placed a miniature part in the creature&#x27;s mouth which, when all lined up on the rear projection plate, blended in perfectly. The final significant scene in this sequence is when Tumak impales the creature on a spear from below. John Richardson, the actor who played Tumak, held nothing in the long shots and pretended to have a pole in his hands, but he did hold a pole in the close-up shots. A miniature pole was built and used for the long shots. It was placed in the studio in front of Richardson&#x27;s hands, and then Harryhausen animated the young &quot;Allosaurus&quot; suspended on wires in front of John, on top of the miniature pole.

The &quot;Pteranodon&quot; sequence took much time to create, primarily because of how hard it would be to make a model pterosaur pick up a real woman. However the solution was simple: Instead of using a large crane on location, the crew had Raquel Welch fall behind a rock, and then the model &quot;Pteranodon&quot; swoops down and flies off with a model of Welch, which was substituted during the single second in which she is behind the rock and not visible. Later, when the creature takes her to its nest, the nest was matted into the scene atop a real rock face by double printing the film. For the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; fight scene, when she is dropped into the water, Harryhausen and the crew released her from two dummy rubber &quot;Pteranodon&quot; claws and while the real Welch fell onto a mattress, the film cut to a long shot of the Welch model suspended on wires.

Robert Brown (Akhoba) wears makeup similar to that worn by Lon Chaney Jr. in the same role in the 1940 version, &quot;One Million B.C.&quot;

Originally Hammer offered the role of Loana to Ursula Andress. When Andress passed on the project due to commitments and salary demands, a search for a replacement resulted in the selection of Welch. Welch, who had finished doing &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; for Fox, was under contract to the studio (who held U.S. distribution rights for the film) and was told by studio President Richard Zanuck that she would be loaned out to Hammer for the production. Although reluctant, Welch said that the selling point was the chance to spend six to eight weeks of filming in London (while shooting interiors) during the height of its &quot;swinging&quot; period.

===Fur bikini===
Welch wore a bikini made of fur and hide in the film. She was described as &quot;wearing mankind&#x27;s first bikini&quot; and the bikini was described as a &quot;definitive look of the 1960s&quot;. The publicity photograph of Welch from the film became a best-selling pinup poster, and something of a cultural phenomenon.

The iconic image was copied by the artist Tom Chantrell to create the film poster promoting the theatrical release of &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; Welch&#x27;s depiction is accompanied by the film&#x27;s title in bold red lettering across a landscape populated with dinosaurs.

Welch stated in a 2012 interview that three form-fitting bikinis were made for her, including two for a wet scene and a fight scene, by costume designer Carl Toms: &quot;Carl just draped me in doe-skin, and I stood there while he worked on it with scissors.&quot; Many noted photographers had been flown to Tenerife by 20th Century Fox on a publicity junket, but the iconic pose of Welch was taken by the unit still photographer. The poster is a story element in the film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;.

===Music===
Composer Mario Nascimbene was in charge of the film&#x27;s music and score. A soundtrack was released in Italy as a 7-track limited edition vinyl LP on the Intermezzo label in 1985. It was re-released in Italy on compact disc in 1994 (now out of print) as a soundtrack compilation including two other Hammer films.
The original score for the film:
==Release==
It was first screened on 25 October 1966 at the Warner Theatre, London, with a general release in the United Kingdom on 30 December 1966, by Warner-Pathé. It was released in the United States on 21 February 1967, by 20th Century Fox. The U.S. cut was censored for a broader audience, losing around nine minutes. Deleted scenes included a provocative dance from Martine Beswick, a gruesome end to one of the ape men in the cave and some footage of the young &quot;Allosaurus&quot;″s attack on the Shell tribe. On 17 October 1966, the British Board of Film Classification announced that the film would receive an A certificate rating. It is currently a PG certificate applied on video in March 1989 distributed by Warner Home Video Ltd.

===Home video===
The film was originally available on VHS and laserdisc. In 2002 Warner Bros. released a UK DVD, including a &quot;Raquel Welch in the Valley of the Dinosaurs&quot; featurette, a 12-minute interview with Ray Harryhausen and the theatrical trailer. A Region 1 DVD (featuring the U.S. edit) was released by 20th Century Fox in 2004.

In October 2016, a special two-disc 50th anniversary edition DVD and Blu-ray was released in the UK by Studio Canal, with new interviews with Welch and Beswick, new Harryhausen storyboard stills, and other promotional imagery. In the United States, a Blu-ray was released on 14 February 2017 by Kino Lorber Studio Classics and includes the international (Disc 1) and U.S. cut (Disc 2) of the film. This issue has more bonus material than the UK edition, including previous interviews with Welch and Harryhausen from 2002 and an audio commentary by film historian Tim Lucas.

==Reception==

===Box office===
Despite the censorship upon release in the U.S., the film was still popular and made $2.5 million in U.S. rentals during its first year of release. It was one of the twelve most popular films at the British box office in 1967.

According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $2,250,000 in rentals to break even and made $4,425,000, meaning it made a solid profit.

In 1968, it was re-released in the UK on a double feature alongside &quot;She&quot; (1965), an earlier Hammer film. The pairing became the ninth most popular theatrical release of the year.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 67% based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 5.64/10.
Among contemporary reviews, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;the whole thing is good humored full-of-action commercial nonsense, but the moppets will love it and older male moppets will probably love Miss Welch&quot;; and &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; noted &quot;Very easy to dismiss the film as a silly spectacle; but Hammer production finesse is much in evidence and Don Chaffey has done a competent job of direction. And it is all hugely enjoyable&quot;; while more recently, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that &quot;seen nowadays it is a kitschy, retro scream. Yet as dinosaurs and giant sea-turtles roam the volcanic earth in &quot;One Million Years BC&quot;, this is also a chance to appreciate the early work of the great special effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen.&quot; Similarly, &quot;TV Guide&quot; concluded &quot;While far from being one of Harryhausen&#x27;s best films (the quality of which had little to do with his abilities), the movie has superb effects that are worth a look for his fans.&quot;

==Legacy==
All the dinosaur models from this film still exist, although the &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Triceratops&quot; were re-purposed for &quot;The Valley of Gwangi&quot; (1969), as Gwangi the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot;. &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; was the first in an unconnected series of prehistoric films from Hammer. It was followed by &quot;Prehistoric Women&quot; (1967), &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&quot; (1970) and &quot;Creatures the World Forgot&quot; (1971). Stock footage depicting the landslide was reused for Alex&#x27;s daydream scene in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Although the films are not connected, the 1970 follow-up film, &quot;When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth&quot;, did use some of the same language as this movie, dialogue that was also used in the 1940 original. Words such as M’Kan (Kill) and Akita (Look/there) are used in all three films. The character played by Robert Brown (and, in the original, Lon Chaney Jr) is called Akhoba, a word used in the 1970 film to mean mercy.

The film was adapted into a 15-page comic strip for the May 1978 issue of the magazine &quot;House of Hammer&quot; (volume 2 #14, published by Top Sellers Ltd). It was drawn by John Bolton from a script by Steve Moore. The cover of the issue featured a painting by Brian Lewis of Welch in the famous fur bikini.

In the 1994 film &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, a large poster of Welch in her role as Loana is used by Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) to conceal his tunnel digging.

In the 2021 film &quot;Belfast&quot;, Buddy (played by Jude Hill) and his family go to the cinema and his father (played by Jamie Dornan) chooses to watch &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot;

Raquel Welch&#x27;s fur bikini costume design and overall looks in this film served as the primary basis for the creation of the character Ayla for the 1995 video game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Ayla is a prehistoric woman that lived in &quot;65000000 B.C.&quot; timeline, and is also a subject of anachronistic and ahistoric narrative, with other contemporaries from her timeline being depicted as a mixture of Rock and Shell people from this movie, who live in a world where dinosaurs still roam the land.

<doc id="570434" wikidata="Q844762" url="?curid=570434" title="General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136">
<text>The General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 was an afterburning turbofan engine being developed by General Electric, Allison Engine Company, and Rolls-Royce (Allison was subsequently acquired by Rolls-Royce) as an alternative powerplant to the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 for the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The two companies stopped work on the project in December 2011 after failing to gather Pentagon support for further development.

==Development==
In the initial plans for Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, all early JSFs were to be powered by an engine derived from Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s F119 turbofan intended for the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF), but it was planned that engine contracts would be competitively tendered from Lot 6 onward. The engines selected would be either the F119 derivative (&quot;F119-JSF&quot;) or an engine produced by the GE/Allison Fighter Engine Team and initially designated &quot;YF120-FX&quot;; RR would join the GE/Allison team shortly after. Derived from GE&#x27;s YF120 turbofan that was also originally for the ATF program, the engine had further hot section developments by Allison and fan developments by RR; in 1995, Allison was acquired by RR and the subsequent GE/RR Fighter Engine Team became a co-operation between GE Aviation in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States (60% share), and Rolls-Royce in Bristol, United Kingdom, and Indianapolis, Indiana, US (40% share).

In 2001, with the Lockheed Martin X-35 selected as the winner of the JSF competition to become the F-35, Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s F119-JSF became the F135, while the alternate GE/RR YF120-FX engine was designated F136. On 21 July 2004, the F136 began full engine runs at GE&#x27;s facility in Evendale, Ohio. The engine ran for over an hour during two separate runs. In August 2005, the United States Department of Defense awarded the GE and Rolls-Royce team a $2.4 billion contract to develop its F136 engine. The contract was for the system development and demonstration (SDD) phase of the F136 initiative, scheduled to run until September 2013.

The US Defense budget announced on 6 February 2006 excluded the F136 — leaving Pratt &amp; Whitney, maker of the F135 engine, as the sole provider of engines for the Lockheed Martin F-35 fighters. Congress, however, overturned this request and allocated funds for FY 2007 later in 2006. In November 2006, the General Electric/Rolls-Royce team successfully completed a 3-month preliminary design review by the F-35 Program Office and the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin.

Because the F136 was in a less mature development state than the F135, GE/RR was able to better adapt its design to the changes resulting from the F-35&#x27;s weight growth; the F136&#x27;s fan and core airflow was upsized to better match the aircraft&#x27;s revised inlet. On 13 February 2008, the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team successfully completed its Critical Design Review (CDR) for the F136. During CDR, the U.S. Government&#x27;s Joint Program Office for the F-35 Lightning II validated and approved the design of the engine. Also during the review, every aspect of the engine design was analyzed and evaluated in order to proceed with the building of the first full development engines. The process involved 80 detailed component and module design reviews, involving technical experts from the JPO, General Electric and Rolls-Royce.

On 20 March 2008, the F136 successfully completed a high-altitude afterburner testing program at the US Air Force Arnold Engineering Development Center in Tennessee, including common exhaust hardware for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft. All test objectives were reached as planned using an engine configured with Conventional Takeoff and Landing (CTOL) and Short Takeoff Vertical Landing (STOVL) common exhaust systems. The engine configuration included a production-size fan and functional augmenter allowing several run periods to full afterburner operation. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team successfully completed Short Take Off, Vertical Landing (STOVL) testing on an F136 engine at the GE testing facility at Peebles, Ohio on 16 July 2008.

The first complete new-build F136 engine began testing 30 January 2009, under the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract with the US Government Joint Program Office for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. This marked the first complete engine assembled following US Government validation of the F136 design in 2008. The milestone was achieved one month ahead of schedule.

Citing the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009, the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team submitted an unsolicited fixed-price offer for the F136 to the Pentagon on 28 September 2009. The fixed-price approach would cover initial F136 engine production, beginning with the F136 second production lot. According to the GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team, the proposal would shift significant cost risk from taxpayers to the Fighter Engine Team until head-to-head competition begins between the F136 and the Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine in 2013.

From 2006 to 2010 the Defense Department has not requested funding for the alternate F136 engine program, but Congress has maintained program funding.

On 19 December 2009, U.S. Congress approved continued funding for the F136 engine program in fiscal year 2010. The U.S. Defense Department did not request FY 2010 funding for the F136 engine program. In a report filed on 18 June 2009, the House Armed Services Committee cited Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine program cost overruns of $1.872 billion as cause to continue funding the F136 engine.

On 2 November 2009, the F136 team said that they would redesign a small part of the diffuser leading to the combustor after a failure during testing. Testing resumed on January 22, 2010. The GE Rolls-Royce Fighter Engine Team is currently in the fourth year of its System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract with the US Government Joint Program Office. The Fighter Engine Team has totaled more than 800 hours of testing on pre-SDD and SDD engines. In early 2010, full afterburning thrust was reached in testing of the first production standard engine.

On 24 March 2011, the Department of Defense issued a 90-day temporary stop work order after Congress failed to pass the defense budget. GE declared that it would continue work on the engine program with their own funds in spite of the stop-work order, as allowed in the order and as had been suggested by Schwartz the previous year. However GE is limited to design work only, as the stop-work prevents their use of the existing hardware.

On 12 April 2011, GE reduced its team on project from 1,000 workers down to 100, who will work on the F136 and engine technologies for &quot;future combat aircraft&quot;. GE will redeploy the workers to commercial projects, but will not hire the hundreds of new engineers it was expecting. On 25 April 2011, the Department of Defense ended the contract with GE and demanded that the engines built to date be turned over.

On 5 May 2011, GE and RR offered to pay for the development through FY2012 and asked for access to the materials. By switching to self funding the cost would reduce from $480 million a year to only $100 million, 60% to be paid by GE and 40% to be paid by RR. After self-funding the project GE and Rolls-Royce announced on 2 December 2011, that they would not continue development of the F136 engine because it is not in their best interest. By then, the six engines had logged more than 1,200 hours of testing since 2009. During the year, GE said that development of the engines was 80% complete; the remaining work would have required US$1.9-2.6 billion in funding.

==Design==
The F136 is a twin-spool axial-flow low-bypass turbofan. It has a 3-stage low-aspect ratio fan driven by a 3-stage low-pressure turbine, and a 5-stage compressor driven by a single-stage turbine; both the fan and compressor stages are one-piece blisks. The STOVL variant&#x27;s shaft-driven LiftFan is connected to the low-pressure spool and engaged through a clutch. The low-pressure spool&#x27;s 3 turbine stages enable more work to be extracted to power the LiftFan, while the conventional takeoff variant retains this architecture for commonality. The annular combustor case is made from &quot;Lamilloy&quot; and cooled by bleed air from the compressor. The two spools are counterrotating, eliminating the stage 1 low pressure turbine nozzle and thus reducing parts count. The vanes behind the turbines are made of ceramic matrix composites (CMC), enabling higher operating temperatures for greater efficiency and thrust. Like the competing F135, the F136 was to have a stealthy augmentor, or afterburner, that blocks line-of-sight of the turbine blades and a convergent-divergent nozzle with serrated flaps that reduce the infrared signature of the exhaust plume. During ground testing, the F136 used the same exhaust system as the F135. The engine would be controlled by a BAE-supplied full authority digital engine control (FADEC).

Because the F136 was designed well into the F-35&#x27;s System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase, it could better match its fan and core to the F-35 inlet, which was revised in 2005 to increase mass flow to for greater thrust due to aircraft weight growth. The F136 produced of thrust in military power and in full afterburner, same as the F135 but with greater temperature margins due to the higher air mass flow, resulting in longer hot-section parts life and greater potential for future growth. In the STOVL configuration, the F136 produced of lift thrust. Combined with thrust from the LiftFan () and two roll posts ( each), the Rolls-Royce LiftSystem produced a total of of thrust. This compares with the maximum thrust of for the Harrier&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine.

<text>Zoosemiotics is the semiotic study of the use of signs among animals, more precisely the study of semiosis among animals, i.e. the study of how something comes to function as a sign to some animal. It is the study of animal forms of knowing.

Considered part of biosemiotics, zoosemiotics is related to the fields of ethology and animal communication. It was developed by semiotician Thomas Sebeok based on the theories of German-Estonian biologist Jakob von Uexküll. The field is defined by having as its subject matter all of those semiotic processes that are shared by both animals and humans. The field also differs from the field of animal communication in that it also interprets signs that are not communicative in the traditional sense, such as camouflage, mimicry, courtship behavior etc. The field also studies cross-species communication, for example between humans and animals.

<doc id="570450" wikidata="Q3141138" url="?curid=570450" title="Hothead Paisan">
<text>Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist is an alternative comic written and drawn by Diane DiMassa published 1991–1998. It features the title character generally wreaking violent vengeance on male oppressors. Recurring characters include Hothead&#x27;s cat Chicken, her wise mystical friend Roz, a talking lamp, and her lover Daphne.

==Publication==
The series began in 1991, published under the imprint Giant Ass Publishing, run by DiMassa&#x27;s partner, Stacy Sheehan. The series ran for 21 issues, ending in 1998, and were collected and published as two volumes: &quot;Hothead Paisan&quot; and &quot;The Revenge of Hothead Paisan&quot;. These volumes were later combined and republished with a 10-page introduction to the main character as a 428-page trade paperback &quot;The Complete Hothead Paisan&quot;.

==Hothead==
According to Gabrielle Dean, the character of Hothead represents a &quot;phallicized dyke&quot; who is &quot;at the mercy of her own rage against society, which she expresses by castrating men who are exaggerated stand-ins for the patriarchal order&quot;. Hothead has changed into a wolf and her hands have become chainsaws. Kim Hall states that Hothead &quot;is an image of feminist resistance that does not rest on purity.&quot;

In 2004, a version was staged as a musical, produced by Animal Prufrock at the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival. The cast included Ani DiFranco, Susan Powter, Ubaka Hill, Toshi Reagon, Julie Wolf, Kate Wolf, and Allyson Palmer of BETTY.

<doc id="570456" wikidata="Q2542485" url="?curid=570456" title="Walkley Awards">
<text>The annual Walkley Awards are presented in Australia to recognise and reward excellence in journalism. They cover all media including print, television, documentary, radio, photographic and online media. The Gold Walkley is the highest prize and is chosen from all category winners. In 2023, Not all awards were open to male journalists. The awards are under the administration of the Walkley Foundation for Journalism.

The Nikon Photography Prizes are also awarded by the Walkley Foundation at the awards ceremony, on behalf of Nikon.

==History==
The awards were instituted in five categories in 1956 by businessman Sir William Walkley, founder of Ampol. After his death, the awards were handled by the Australian Journalists&#x27; Association which, in 1992, was merged into the Media, Entertainment &amp; Arts Alliance. In 2000, the alliance voted to establish the Walkley Foundation. In that same year, the Walkley Awards were merged with the Nikon Press Photographer of the Year Awards.

The 2015 ceremony was held on 3 December at Crown Casino in Melbourne and was broadcast through an online live stream as well as on A-PAC. In 2016, the event moved to the Brisbane Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre.

==Awards==
Excluding the non-fiction book award, only work published by Australian-based media organisations is eligible for an award. Entries are initially evaluated by a jury on newsworthiness, research, writing, production, incisiveness, impact, public benefit, ethics, originality, innovation and creative flair — or other relevant criteria in respect of graphics and electronic media. The jury shortlists three entrants to the Walkley Advisory Board, who select the best entrant in each category, as well as the winner of the &quot;Press Photographer of the Year&quot;, &quot;Journalism Leadership Award&quot; and the &quot;Gold Walkley&quot; awards.

Finalists are chosen by an independent board of eminent journalists and photographers. The awards cover all media including print, television, radio, photographic and online media. They can be regarded as the Australian equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize.

The Gold Walkley is the major award, being chosen from all category winners.

The awards have been archived by the Pandora Archive since 2002.

The finalists are formally announced in October each year and the awards are presented at a formal ceremony in late November or early December.

<text>A housing cooperative, or housing co-op, is a legal entity which owns real estate consisting of one or more residential buildings. The entity is usually a cooperative or a corporation and constitutes a form of housing tenure. Typically housing cooperatives are owned by shareholders but in some cases they can be owned by a non-profit organization. They are a distinctive form of home ownership that have many characteristics that differ from other residential arrangements such as single family home ownership, condominiums and renting.

The cooperative is membership based, with membership granted by way of a share purchase in the cooperative. Each shareholder in the legal entity is granted the right to occupy one housing unit. A primary advantage of the housing cooperative is the pooling of the members&#x27; resources so that their buying power is leveraged; thus lowering the cost per member in all the services and products associated with home ownership.

Another key element in some forms of housing cooperatives is that the members, through their elected representatives, screen and select who may live in the cooperative, unlike any other form of home ownership.

Housing cooperatives fall into two general tenure categories: non-ownership (referred to as non-equity or continuing) and ownership (referred to as equity or strata). In non-equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted subject to an occupancy agreement, which is similar to a lease. In equity cooperatives, occupancy rights are sometimes granted by way of the purchase agreements and legal instruments registered on the title. The corporation&#x27;s articles of incorporation and bylaws as well as occupancy agreement specifies the cooperative&#x27;s rules.

The word &quot;cooperative&quot; is also used to describe a non-share capital co-op model in which fee-paying members obtain the right to occupy a bedroom and share the communal resources of a house owned by a cooperative organization. Such is the case with student cooperatives in some college and university communities across the United States.

==Legal status==
As a legal entity, a co-op can contract with other companies or hire individuals to provide it with services, such as a maintenance contractor or a building manager. It can also hire employees, such as a manager or a caretaker, to deal with specific upkeep tasks at which volunteers may hesitate or may not be skilled, such as electrical maintenance.

In non-equity cooperatives and in limited equity cooperatives, a shareholder in a co-op does not own real estate, but a share of the legal entity that does own real estate. Co-operative ownership is quite distinct from condominiums where people own individual units and have little say in who moves into the other units. Because of this, most jurisdictions have developed separate legislation, similar to laws that regulate companies, to regulate how co-ops are operated and the rights and obligations of shareholders.

==Ownership==

Each resident or resident household has membership in the co-operative association. In non-equity cooperatives, members have occupancy rights to a specific suite within the housing co-operative as outlined in their &quot;occupancy agreement&quot;, or &quot;proprietary lease&quot;, which is essentially a lease. In ownership cooperatives, occupancy rights are transferred to the purchaser by way of the title transfer.

Since the housing cooperative holds title to all the property and housing structures, it bears the cost of maintaining, repairing and replacing them. This relieves the member from the cost and burden of such work. In that sense, the housing cooperative is like the landlord in a rental setting. However, another hallmark of cooperative living is that it is nonprofit, so that the work is done at cost, with no profit motive involved.

In some cases, the co-op follows Rochdale Principles where each shareholder has only one vote. Most cooperatives are incorporated as limited stock companies where the number of votes an owner has is tied to the number of shares owned by the person. Whichever form of voting is employed it is necessary to conduct an election among shareholders to determine who will represent them on the board of directors (if one exists), the governing body of the co-operative. The board of directors is generally responsible for the business decisions including the financial requirements and sustainability of the co-operative. Although politics vary from co-op to co-op and depend largely on the wishes of its members, it is a general rule that a majority vote of the board is necessary to make business decisions.

==Management==
In larger co-ops, members of a co-op typically elect a board of directors from amongst the shareholders at a general meeting, usually the annual general meeting. In smaller co-ops, all members sit on the board.

A housing cooperative&#x27;s board of directors is elected by the membership, providing a voice and representation in the governance of the property. Rules are determined by the board, providing a flexible means of addressing the issues that arise in a community to assure the members&#x27; peaceful possession of their homes.

==Finance==

A housing cooperative is normally &quot;de facto&quot; non-profit, since usually most of its income comes from the rents paid by its residents (if in a formal corporation, then shareholders), who are invariably its members. There is no point in creating a deliberate surplus—except for operational requirements such as setting aside funds for replacement of assets—since that simply means that the rents paid by members are set higher than the expenses. (It is possible for a housing co-op to own other revenue-generating assets, such as a subsidiary business which could produce surplus income to offset the cost of the housing, but in those cases the housing rents are usually reduced to compensate for the additional revenue.)

In the lifecycle of buildings, the replacement of assets (capital repairs) requires significant funds which can be obtained through a variety of ways: assessments on current owners; sales of Treasury Stock (former rental units) to new shareholders; draw downs of reserves; unsecured loans; operating surpluses; fees on the sales of units between shareholders and new and increases to existing mortgages.

There are housing co-ops of the rich and famous: John Lennon, for instance, lived in The Dakota, a housing co-operative,
and most apartments in New York City that are owned rather than rented are held through a co-operative
rather than via a condominium arrangement.

===Market-rate and limited-equity co-ops===
There are two main types of housing co-operative share pricing: market rate and limited equity. With market rate, the share price is allowed to rise on the open market and shareholders may sell at whatever price the market will bear when they want to move out. In many ways market rate is thus similar financially to owning a condominium, with the difference being that often the co-op may carry a mortgage, resulting in a much higher monthly fee paid to the co-op than would be so in a condominium. The purchase price of a comparable unit in the co-op is typically much lower, however.

With limited equity, the co-op has rules regarding pricing of shares when sold. The idea behind limited equity is to maintain affordable housing. A sub-set of the limited equity model is the no-equity model, which looks very much like renting, with a very low purchase price (comparable to a rental security deposit) and a monthly fee in lieu of rent. When selling, all that is re-couped is that very low purchase price.

== Research on housing cooperatives ==
Research in Canada found that housing cooperatives had residents rate themselves as having the highest quality of life and housing satisfaction of any housing organization in the city.
Other research among older residents from the rural United States found that those living in housing cooperatives felt much safer, independent, satisfied with life, had more friends, had more privacy, were healthier and had things repaired faster. Australian researchers found that cooperative housing built stronger social networks and support, as well as better relationships with neighbours compared to other forms of housing. They cost 14% less for residents and had lower rates of debt and vacancy. Other US research has found that housing cooperatives tended to have higher rates of building quality, building safety, feelings of security among residents, lower crime rates, stable access to housing and significantly lower costs compared to conventional housing.

==By country==

===Australia===

Housing co-operatives in Australia are primarily non-equity rental co-operatives, but there are some equity co-operatives as well. The rental co-operatives are generally a part of the Australian social housing/community housing sector and have been funded by various iterations of government funding programs.

One of the largest co-operative housing organisations in Australia is Common Equity Housing Ltd (CEHL) in the state of Victoria. CEHL is a registered housing association with its shares held by its 103-member co-operatives. As of 2023 CEHL co-operatives house 4,291 people in 2,101 homes.

Common Equity, in the state of NSW, is also a registered housing provider and manages 500 properties in 31 member housing co-operatives 

===Canada===

Co-ops in Canada offer an affordable alternative to renting, but waiting lists for the units can be years-long.

===France===
In 2013, the opening of &quot;La Maison des Babayagas&quot;, an innovative housing co-op in Paris, gained worldwide attention. It was formed as a self-help community and built with financial assistance from the municipal government, specifically for female senior citizens. Located in the Paris suburb of Montreuil after many years of planning, it looks like any other apartment building. The senior citizens stay out of nursing homes, by staying active, alert, and assisting one another.

The purpose of the Baba Yaga Association is to create and develop an innovative lay residence for aging women that is: (1) self-managed, without hierarchy and without supervision; (2) united collective, with regard to finances as well as daily life; (3) citizen civic-minded, through openness to the community /city and through mutual interaction, engaging in its political, cultural and social life in a spirit of participatory democracy; (4) ecological in all aspects of life, in conformity with the values and actions expressed in the Charter of Living of the House of Babayagas.

Generally, the association&#x27;s activities are tied to the purpose above, in particular, the development of a popular entity called the University of Knowledge of the Elderly (UNISAVIE: Université du savoir des vieux), and the initiation of a movement to promote other living places that are organized into similar networks.

The community charter sets out expectations for privacy. Each apartment is self-contained. Monthly meetings assure the optimal routines of the building and ensure that each person may participate fully and with complete liberty of expression. Plans set out the routine intervention of a mediator who could help get to the bottom of the causes of eventual conflicts in order to allow for their resolution.

The success of the Paris co-op inspired several Canadian grassroots groups to adopt similar values in senior housing initiatives; these values include autonomy and self-management, solidarity and mutual aid, civic engagement, and ecological responsibility.

===Germany===
Housing cooperatives, or &quot;Wohnungsgenossenschaften&quot; in German, are a type of housing association that provides affordable housing to its members. They are formed and run by a group of people who come together to pool their resources in order to purchase or build housing for their own use.

In Germany, housing cooperatives are typically organized as non-profit organizations, which means that any profits made from the sale or rental of the housing are reinvested in the cooperative rather than being distributed to shareholders. This allows housing cooperatives to offer lower prices for housing than would be possible for for-profit organizations.
Members of a housing cooperative typically have the right to occupy a specific unit within the cooperative&#x27;s housing complex, and they also have a say in the management and decision-making of the cooperative. This can include voting on issues related to the maintenance and operation of the housing complex, as well as electing a board of directors to oversee the cooperative&#x27;s operations.

Housing cooperatives are a popular form of housing in Germany, particularly in urban areas, and they are often seen as a way to provide affordable, community-oriented housing options.

In the Industrialisation in the 19th century there were many housing cooperatives founded in Germany. Presently, there are over 2,000 housing cooperatives with over two million apartments and over three million members in Germany. The public housing cooperatives are organised in the GdW Bundesverband deutscher Wohnungs- und Immobilienunternehmen (Federal association of German housing and real estate enterprise registered associations).

===Egypt===

The Housing cooperative project in Egypt aims to serve the low-income class, as it provides them with housing units consisting of two rooms, a hall or three rooms and a fully finished hall, with an area ranging from 75 to 90 square meters. In addition, these units are offered at a cost price only, with direct support ranging from 5 to 25 thousand pounds. The beneficiary of this unit can pay its price over a period of 20 years, as 538,000 units have been implemented in all governorates and new cities until 2022, implemented by Ministry of Housing, Utilities &amp; Urban Communities.

===India===

In India, most &#x27;flats&#x27; are owned outright. i.e. the title to each individual flat is separate. There is usually a governing body/society/association to administer maintenance and other building needs. These are comparable to the Condominium Buildings in the USA. The laws governing the building, its governing body and how flats within the building are transferred differ from state to state.

Certain buildings are organized as &quot;Cooperative Housing Societies&quot; where one actually owns a share in the Cooperative rather than the flat itself. This structure was very popular in the past but has become less common in recent times. Most states have separate laws governing Cooperative Housing Societies.

 for additional information.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands there are three very different types of organization that could be considered a housing cooperative:

====Housing corporation====
A &quot;housing corporation&quot; (&quot;woningcorporatie&quot;) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building and maintaining housing for rent for people with lower income. The first housing corporations started in the second half of the 19th century as small cooperative associations. The first such association in the world, &quot;VAK&quot; (&quot;association for the working class&quot;) was founded in 1852 in Amsterdam. Between 2.4 and 2.5 million apartments in the Netherlands are rented by the housing corporations, i.e. more than 30% of the total of household dwellings (apartments and houses).

==== Owner association ====
A &quot;(house) owners&#x27; association&quot; (&quot;Vereniging van Eigenaren&quot;, VvE) is by Dutch law established wherever there are separately owned apartments in one building. The members are legally owners of their own apartment but have to cooperate in the association for the maintenance of the building as a whole.

==== Living cooperation ====
A &quot;living cooperation&quot; (&quot;wooncoöperatie&quot;) is a construct in which residents jointly own an apartment building using a democratically controlled cooperative, and pay rent to their own organisation. They were prohibited after World War II and legalised in 2015.

=== New Zealand ===
&quot;Company-share&quot; apartments operate in the New Zealand housing system.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, a &quot;tenant-owner&#x27;s association&quot; often forms as a means to buy new flats. When the cooperative is set up, it takes the major part of the loan needed to buy a property. These loans will then be paid off during a fixed period of years (typically 20 to 30), and once this is done, the cooperative is dispersed and the flats are transformed into condominiums.

===Nordic countries===
A &quot;tenant-owner&#x27;s association&quot; (Swedish: &quot;bostadsrättsförening&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;borettslag&quot;, Danish: &quot;andelsboligforening&quot;) is a legal term used in the Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Denmark, and Norway) for a type of joint ownership of property in which the whole property is owned by a co-operative association, which in its turn is owned by its members. Each member holds a share in the association that is proportional to the area of his apartment. Members are required to have a tenant-ownership, which represents the apartment, and in most cases live permanently at the address. There are some legal differences between the countries, mainly concerning the conditions of ownership.

In Sweden, 16% of the population lives in apartments in housing cooperatives, while 25% live in rented apartments (more common among young adults and immigrants) and 50% live in private one-family houses (more common among families with children), the remainder living in other forms such as student dormitories or elderly homes.

In Finland, by contrast to the Scandinavian countries, housing cooperatives in the strict sense are extremely rare; instead, Finnish tenant-owned housing properties are generally organized as limited companies (Finnish ) in a system peculiar to Finnish law. The Finnish arrangement is similar to a housing cooperative in that the property is owned by a non-profit corporation and the right to use each unit is tied to ownership of a certain set of shares.

===United Kingdom===
Housing co-operatives are uncommon in the UK, making up about 0.1% of housing stock.

Most are based in urban areas and consist of affordable shared accommodation where the members look after the property themselves. Waiting lists can be very long due to the rarity of housing co-operatives. In some areas the application procedure is integrated into the council housing application system. The laws differ between England and Scotland. The Confederation of Co-operative Housing provides information on housing cooperatives in the United Kingdom and has published a guide on setting them up. The Shelter website provides information on housing and has information specific to England and Scotland.

The Catalyst Collective provides information about starting co-operatives in the UK and explains the legal structure of a housing coop. Radical Routes offers a guide on how to set up a housing co-operative.

==== Student housing cooperatives ====

Factors of raising cost of living for students and quality of accommodation have led to a drive for Student Housing Co-operatives within the UK inspired by the existing North American Student Housing Cooperatives and their work through North American Students of Cooperation. Edinburgh Student Housing Co-operative and Birmingham Student Housing Co-operative opened in 2014 and Sheffield Student Housing Co-operative in 2015. All existing Student Housing Co-operatives are members of Students for Cooperation.

===United States===
In the United States, housing co-ops are usually categorized as corporations or LLCs and are found in abundance in the area from Madison, Wisconsin, to the New York metropolitan area. There are also a number of cooperative and mutual housing projects still in operation across the US that were the result of the purchase of federal defense housing developments by their tenants or groups of returning war veterans and their families. These developments include seven of the eight middle-class housing projects built by the US government between 1940 and 1942 under the auspices of the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency. There are many regional housing cooperative associations, such as the Midwest Association of Housing Cooperatives, which is based in Michigan and serves the Midwest region, covering Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and more.

The National Association of Housing Cooperatives (NAHC) represents all cooperatives within the United States who are members of the organization. This organization is a nonprofit, national federation of housing cooperatives, mutual housing associations, other resident-owned or controlled housing, professionals, organizations, and individuals interested in promoting the interests of cooperative housing communities. NAHC is the only national cooperative housing organization, and aims to support and educate existing and new cooperative housing communities as the best and most economical form of homeownership.

NASCO, or North American Students of Cooperation, is an organization founded in 1968 that has helped organized cooperative living for students. With a presence in over 100 towns and cities across North America, NASCO has provided tens of thousands of students with sustainable housing.

====New York metropolitan area====

Cooperatives have a long history in metropolitan New York – in November 1882, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; describes several cooperative apartment buildings already in existence, with plans to build more – and can be found throughout New York City, Westchester County, which borders the city to the north, and towns in northern New Jersey that are close to Manhattan, including Fort Lee, Edgewater, Ramsey, Passaic and Weehawken. Alku and Alku Toinen, apartment buildings built in 1916 by the Finnish American immigrant community in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City, were the first nonprofit housing cooperatives in New York City.

Apartment buildings and multiple-family housing make up a more significant share of the housing stock in the New York City area than in most other U.S. cities as over 75% of apartment buildings in NYC are co-ops. Reasons suggested to explain why cooperatives are relatively more common than condominiums in the New York City area are:

*Inspired by Abraham Kazan, cooperatives appeared at least as far back as the 1920s while a legal basis for condominium form of ownership was not available in New York State until 1964. Passage of the Condominium Act then opened a wave of construction of condominium buildings.
* The cooperative form can be advantageous as a building mortgage can be carried by the cooperative corporation, leaving less financing to be obtained by each co-op owner. Under condominium ownership only the separate condo owners provide financing. Particularly when interest rates are high, a conversion sponsor may find unit buyers more easily under the cooperative arrangement as buyers will have less financing to arrange on their own; the apparent purchase price of a unit in a cooperative building holding an underlying mortgage is lower than a condo purchase. Cooperative unit buyers may not accurately weigh their share of the building&#x27;s mortgage.
* Also, later in a building&#x27;s life after conversion, major new investments required to repair or replace building systems can be raised by a new central mortgage in a cooperative, while in a condominium funds could only be raised by onerous assessments being required of each individual unit owner. However, New York&#x27;s condominium law was amended in 1997 to allow condominium associations to borrow money.
* The 1974 creation and then subsequent influence on policy by the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a housing advocacy group, which enabled the conversion of over 1,600 foreclosed, city-held rentals into limited-equity, resident-controlled co-ops. 
* A co-op building&#x27;s board can exercise its own business discretion to impose restrictions on shareholders, and reject prospective purchasers without explanation, as long as the board does not violate federal and state housing or civil rights laws.

Most of the housing cooperatives in the greater New York area were converted to that status during the 1980s; generally, they were large buildings built between the 1920s and 1950s that a single landlord or corporation owned and rented out that became unprofitable as rental properties. To encourage individual ownership of units, the initial buyers of units (buying from the owner of the entire building) did not have to be approved by a board. These units are known as sponsor units. Also, the rental tenants living in the building at the time of the conversion were usually given an option to buy at a discount. If the tenants were rent-controlled, the law usually protects them by allowing them to stay as renters and the unit may not be occupied by a purchaser until said tenant dies or moves out. Many of these buildings, especially in Manhattan, are actually quite luxurious and exclusive; many celebrities live in them and some famous people are even rejected by co-op boards. In the 1990s and 2000s some rental buildings in the Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach areas went through a similar conversion process, though not to the degree of New York.

Many of the cooperatives originally built as co-ops were sponsored by trade unions, such as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. One of the largest projects was Cooperative Village in Lower East Side of Manhattan. The United Housing Foundation was set up in 1951 and built Co-op City in The Bronx, designed by architect Herman Jessor. One of the first subsidized, fixed-value cooperatives was Morningside Gardens in Manhattan&#x27;s Morningside Heights.

Another dynamic also contributed to the large number of cooperatives established in the 1980s and 1990s in New York City – in this case by low- and moderate-income tenant groups. In the 1970s, many New York City private landlords were struggling to maintain their aging properties in the face of high interest rates, redlining, white flight and rising fuel costs. The period also saw some landlord-induced arson to obtain insurance proceeds and widespread non-payment of real estate taxes – over 20% of multi-family residential properties were in arrears in the mid-1970s. In 1977, the city passed Local Law #45, which allowed the city to begin foreclosure proceedings after just one year of non-payment of taxes, not three, resulting in the takeover of thousands of buildings, many of them occupied, by the city of New York through a legal action known as an &quot;in rem foreclosure&quot;. In September 1978, the city&#x27;s housing agency, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), created a series of new housing programs designed to give building residents and community groups control and eventual ownership of in rem buildings.

The Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), established in 1974, began to assist residents of these buildings to manage, rehabilitate and acquire their buildings, and form limited-equity housing co-operatives. Working with the city&#x27;s housing agency, its existing loan programs and the power to dispose of abandoned property to non-profit organizations, as well as the state laws governing the establishment of co-operatives, UHAB was able to provide low-income people with the tools – seed money, legal advice, architectural plans, bookkeeping training – to build and run limited-equity housing co-operatives. Through a long-standing contract with the city to provide training and technical assistance to residents of buildings in the Tenant Interim Lease (TIL) Program, UHAB has worked with more than 1,600 coops, preserving over 30,000 units of affordable housing.

Some cooperatives in New York City do not own the land upon which their building is situated. These &#x27;land-lease&#x27; buildings often have significant drawbacks for cooperative owners. However, there have been cases where shareholders of a building have bought the surrounding land, such as 167 East 61st Street (formerly known as Trump Plaza), where residents gathered $183 million to buy the surrounding land.

==== Student housing cooperatives ====

Student cooperatives provide housing and dining services to those who attend specific educational institutions. Some notable groups include Berkeley Student Cooperative, Santa Barbara Housing Cooperative and the Oberlin Student Cooperative Association.

<doc id="570491" wikidata="Q615812" url="?curid=570491" title="The Gallopin' Gaucho">
<text>The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho is a 1928 American animated short film and the second short film featuring Mickey Mouse to be produced, following &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and preceding &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. The Disney studios completed the silent version in August 1928, but did not release it in order to work on &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; was released, with sound, after &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; on December 30 of the same year.

Both Mickey and Minnie Mouse had already made their initial debuts with the test screening of &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; on May 15, 1928, but that film had failed to catch the attention of distributors when first produced as a silent film. &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; was a second attempt at success by co-directors Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. The latter also served as the sole animator for it.

Roy O. Disney wrote down the total budget of the short in his ledger book, which ended up costing $4,249.73, which was about $720 more than the costs of &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;&#x27;s $3,528.50 budget.

The short was intended as a parody of Douglas Fairbanks&#x27;s &quot;The Gaucho&quot;, a film first released on November 21, 1927. Following the original film, the events of the short take place in the Pampas of Argentina with Mickey cast as the &quot;gaucho&quot; of the title.

The short entered the US public domain on January 1, 2024.

==Plot==
Mickey is introduced riding on a rhea. He soon reaches local bar and restaurant &quot;Cantino Argentino&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;). He enters the establishment with the apparent intent to relax with some drinking and smoking. On the wall, a wanted sign for Mickey saying El gaucho, meaning Mickey Mouse is a bandit or a crook.

Already present are resident barmaid and dancer Minnie Mouse and a fellow customer. The latter is Black Pete, who is introduced as a wanted outlaw.

Minnie performs the tango and salsa, and both customers start flirting with her. Pete then attempts to put an early ending to their emerging rivalry by proceeding in kidnapping her. He escapes on his donkey while Mickey gives chase on his rhea and soon catches up to his rival. Pete and Mickey then proceed in challenging each other to a sword duel. The latter emerges the victor (by covering Pete&#x27;s head with a chamber pot he pulls out from under a bed) and finally gets hold of Minnie. The finale has Mickey and Minnie riding the rhea stage left until they are obscured entirely by trees in the foreground.

==Characters==

In later interviews, Iwerks would comment that Mickey as featured in &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; was intended to be a swashbuckler, an adventurer modelled after Fairbanks himself.

Pete had already been established as an antagonist in both the &quot;Alice Comedies&quot; and the &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; series, but this short marks his first encounter with either Mickey or Minnie. The latter pair also appears unfamiliar to each other.

The feature characters of &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; were obscure. When the cartoon starts, Mickey and Minnie have the same eyes as they have in &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, but once Black Pete appears they suddenly have the dot eyes from &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Mickey was at first thought to be much too similar to Oswald the Rabbit, which may have helped to explain the audience&#x27;s apparent lack of interest in him. The mostly adult audience had become bored with what came to be called &quot;rubber hose&quot; animation. Disney would soon start to contemplate ways to distinguish the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; series from his previous work and that of his rivals. Minnie&#x27;s role as performer and damsel in distress is solidified in this. It is also the first time she wears her distinctive oversized high-heeled pumps, although they fall off when she is kidnapped, and she spends the rest of the cartoon shoeless. Mickey is also seen wearing shoes for the first time. As the years went by, animators would change Mickey Mouse. In the first three Mickey Mouse shorts, he is a character meant to appeal to adult sensibilities; he smokes, drinks, and cavorts. Soon after Walt and his animators revised their star (for the first, but not for the last time), after which Mickey Mouse became the &quot;wholesome&quot; character designed to appeal to children and to please the parent.

==Reception==
&quot;The Film Daily&quot; (January 6, 1929) said: &quot;This features Mickey Mouse, the demon hero who has his ups and downs trying to rescue his sweetie who has been kidnapped by the villain Cat. In this one he takes a regular Doug Fairbanks part as a hard riding gaucho of the South American pampas. It is good burlesquing all the way, and the cartoon work of Walt Disney is clever in the extreme. It has some neat comedy effects through the addition of sound, which make the film far more enjoyable and laughable than it could possibly be in silent form.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; (January 9, 1929) said: &quot;Good six minutes for the big programs because the animated drawings do some giggle getting stuff. This is Walt Disney penmanship, programmed as introducing a new cartoon character, &#x27;Mickey Mouse&#x27;, with Powers having synchronized via Cinephone. Sound effects won some laughs here on their own, but after it&#x27;s all over the impression remains that any alert pit drummer can duplicate... Value in this one comes from the antics Disney makes his figures perform during a chase and a duel. Familiar enough as a plot, but some new wrinkles in body gymnastics and the fantastic means to gain numerous ends. Audience liked it and although enhanced by the effects the reel is strong enough to stand in the A houses plus just an organ or orchestra. If the musicians are smart enough to keep pace with it so much the better. An unusual cartoon in being good with or without sound.&quot;

==Music==
The short&#x27;s music was arranged by Carl Stalling and contains an instrumental version of &quot;Kingdom Coming&quot; by American composer Henry Clay Work (1862), followed by &quot;La paloma&quot;, by Spanish composer Sebastián Iradier Salaverri. &quot;La paloma&quot; is danced to by Minnie Mouse. &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; is one of the earliest sound films to represent Latin American places and culture. Another song included in the score is &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;.

==Home media==
The short was released on December 2, 2002 on &quot;Walt Disney Treasures: Mickey Mouse in Black and White&quot;.

<doc id="570498" wikidata="Q5151881" url="?curid=570498" title="23 enigma">
<text>The 23 enigma is a belief in the significance of the number 23. The concept of the 23 enigma has been popularized by various books, movies, and conspiracy theories, which suggest that the number 23 appears with unusual frequency in various contexts and may be a symbol of some larger, hidden significance.

==Origins==
Robert Anton Wilson cites William S. Burroughs as the first person to believe in the 23 enigma. Wilson, in a 1977 article in &quot;Fortean Times&quot;, related the following anecdote:

==In literature==
The 23 enigma can be seen in:

* Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; (therein called the &quot;23/17 Phenomenon&quot;)
* Wilson&#x27;s 1977 book &quot;Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot; (therein called &quot;the Law of Fives&quot; or &quot;the 23 Enigma&quot;)
* Arthur Koestler&#x27;s contribution to &quot;The Challenge of Chance: A Mass Experiment in Telepathy and Its Unexpected Outcome&quot; (1973)
* &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;

The text titled &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; claims that &quot;All things happen in fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5&quot;—this is referred to as the Law of Fives. The 23 enigma is regarded as a corollary of the Law of Fives because 2 + 3 = 5.

In these works, 23 is considered lucky, unlucky, sinister, strange, sacred to the goddess Eris, or sacred to the unholy gods of the Cthulhu Mythos.

The 23 enigma can be viewed as an example of apophenia, selection bias and confirmation bias. In interviews, Wilson acknowledged the self-fulfilling nature of the 23 enigma, implying that the real value of the Law of Fives and the 23 enigma is in their demonstration of the mind&#x27;s ability to perceive &quot;truth&quot; in nearly anything.

In the &quot;Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, Wilson expresses the same view, saying that one can find numerological significance in anything, provided that one has &quot;sufficient cleverness&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Music and art duo The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF and the K Foundation) named themselves after the fictional conspiratorial group &quot;The Justified Ancients of Mummu&quot; from &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;; the number 23 is a recurring theme in the duo&#x27;s work. Perhaps most infamously, as the K Foundation they performed a performance art piece, &quot;K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot; on 23 August 1994 and subsequently agreed not to publicly discuss the burning for a period of 23 years. 23 years to the day after the burning they returned to launch a novel and discuss why they had burnt the money.

The 2007 film &quot;The Number 23&quot;, starring Jim Carrey, is the story of a man who becomes obsessed with the number 23 while reading a book of the same title that seems to be about his life.

Industrial music group Throbbing Gristle recounted in great detail the meeting of Burroughs and Captain Clark and the significance of the number 23 in the ballad &quot;The Old Man Smiled&quot;. Their 1980 album &quot;Heathen Earth&quot;, where this song appears, also features the number 23 on the cover.

<doc id="570517" wikidata="Q5326213" url="?curid=570517" title="Earl of Bothwell">
<text>Earl of Bothwell was a title that was created twice in the Peerage of Scotland. It was first created for Patrick Hepburn in 1488, and was forfeited in 1567. Subsequently, the earldom was re-created for the 4th Earl&#x27;s nephew and heir of line, Francis Stewart, whose father was an illegitimate son of James V. The second creation was forfeited in 1612, and although the heir was subsequently rehabilitated, the title was never restored.

The title Duke of Orkney was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1567 for James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, with the subsidiary title &quot;Marquess of Fife&quot;. All titles were declared forfeit in 1567.

==Earls of Bothwell, first creation (1488)==
*Patrick Hepburn, 1st Earl of Bothwell (d. 1508)
*Adam Hepburn, 2nd Earl of Bothwell (1492–1513)
*Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Earl of Bothwell (d. 1556)
*James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell (1535–1578) became Duke of Orkney in 1567

==Duke of Orkney (1567)==
*James Hepburn, 1st Duke of Orkney (1535–1578) (forfeited all titles in 1567)

==Earls of Bothwell, second creation (1587)==
*Francis Stewart, 1st (or 5th) Earl of Bothwell (1563–1612)
*Francis Stewart, but for the attainder 2nd (or 6th) Earl of Bothwell (c. 1584–1640)
*Charles Stewart, but for the attainder 3rd (or 7th) Earl of Bothwell (c. 1617–1651)
*Robert Stewart, but for the attainder 4th (or 8th) Earl of Bothwell (fl. 1656)

The next heir appears to have been Captain Francis Stewart of Coldingham, a cavalry officer who commanded the royalist left wing at the Battle of Bothwell Brig in 1679, and who seems to have died around 1683; the male line has not been traced beyond this point.

<doc id="570536" wikidata="Q380227" url="?curid=570536" title="Counterparts (Rush album)">
<text>Counterparts is the fifteenth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released October 19, 1993, on Anthem Records. After the band finished touring its previous album &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; (1991) in mid-1992, the members took a break before starting work on a follow-up.

&quot;Counterparts&quot; reached No. 2 in the United States, one of the band&#x27;s two highest-charting albums in the country, and No. 6 in Canada. The first single, &quot;Stick It Out&quot;, was No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart for four weeks. In 1994, the instrumental &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. &quot;Counterparts&quot; was remastered in 2004 and reissued in 2013 as part of &quot;The Studio Albums 1989–2007&quot; box set. In 2015 it was reissued after being remastered by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios following a direct approach by Rush to remaster their entire back catalogue.

==Background and writing==
In June 1992, the band finished their Roll the Bones Tour in support of &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; (1991). Before the group started to work on the album they casually set out some goals that they wanted to achieve with it from conversations during the Roll the Bones Tour. They agreed to achieve &quot;a sense of balance between spontaneity and refinement [...] and perhaps work on a more organic approach to the songs&quot;. The group agreed that rock band Primus, who opened for them on the Roll the Bones Tour, and Pearl Jam influenced them to tweak their sound further.

As with their previous two studio albums, Rush retreated to Chalet Studios in Claremont, Ontario, to write and rehearse new material during the week, returning home on weekends to see their families. They adopted their usual practice of Lee and Lifeson working on the music while Peart worked alone on the lyrics. They stayed at Chalet for about two months, and rehearsed well enough so they could concentrate on obtaining a satisfactory sound and a spontaneous performance for their respective parts. Lee and Lifeson put their ideas down using an eight-track Alesis Digital Audio Tape recorder with Cubase Audio software. The group faced many technical problems which delayed the writing process to the point where Peart had a short amount of time to arrange his parts, but as Lee recalled: &quot;He went through a massive rehearsal period; he works tremendously hard and it&#x27;s incredible to witness.&quot;

&quot;Counterparts&quot; marks a continuation in the band&#x27;s transition from synthesizers back to guitar-oriented music which had started on &quot;Presto&quot; (1989). Lifeson said that this was the first time since &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981) that there was a conscious decision to have the guitar take a predominant role, resulting in a more satisfying album for him. The writing sessions were met with increased tension between Lee and Lifeson, matters of which began on the Roll the Bones Tour over musical differences. Lifeson had constantly asked for Lee not to use any keyboards for the album but Lee brought them into the studio which created &quot;an immediate atmosphere.&quot; Lee maintained that keyboards were used on &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; merely to embellish the songs and wished to use them in the same manner for &quot;Counterparts&quot;. &quot;But Alex was making assumptions that I wanted keyboards all over the place. It was a very volatile situation.&quot; Lifeson said that the two had &quot;greater emotional ups and downs&quot; during the writing stage than any other previous Rush album and partly blamed various personal &quot;external pressures&quot; that did not relate to either&#x27;s personal lives.

When it came to writing lyrics, Peart did not have a form of common thread between the individual songs like he had on &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; and instead devised &quot;a selection of individual themes I didn&#x27;t really associate at the time.&quot; Among the topics he thought about were the differences between genders, the anima and animus principle devised by psychologist Carl Jung, and the good and bad regarding heroism. Peart did point out that duality became the only unifying theme and inspired the album&#x27;s title.

==Recording==
Lee recalled the difficulty the band had in achieving more power from some tracks with producer Rupert Hine on &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; in the studio but were able to on tour, &quot;and I think that stuck in the back of our minds.&quot; This matching of music and production style became an element that the band wanted to focus on for &quot;Counterparts&quot; and in doing so wanted to work with different producers and engineers. Initially, they talked to a lot of young producers, but they soon realized that there was little to gain from someone who had worked on fewer albums than the group had released over its career, and sought someone experienced. Rush chose English producer Peter Collins who&#x27;d co-produced &quot;Power Windows&quot; (1985) and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; (1987) with the band. Lee said that the band had remained friendly with Collins, and noticed he&#x27;d developed as a producer since they&#x27;d last worked with him, including his work with more American rock bands. &quot;As soon as we talked we knew it would be great [...] and he agreed with the vision of what we saw; and his comments, criticizing the past couple records, sonically anyway, were very much in line with the direction we wanted to go, and we thought, &#x27;Bingo! Here you go, this is what we need.&#x27; Collins had different engineers in mind to work with, so a &quot;laborious but interesting search&quot; took place to find someone suitable that involved hearing tapes from artists worldwide. In the end, they chose Kevin &quot;The Caveman&quot; Shirley for the recording; Lee said it was because of his &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;natural&quot; sound, which required minimal use of reverb which was difficult for the band to get used to at first. For mixing, the band employed Australian engineer Michael Letho.

The album was recorded from April to June 1993 at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, and McClear Pathé in Toronto. The 8-track demos were transferred onto the studio&#x27;s 24-track recorder and became guide tracks for the band to follow and re-record their parts. Lifeson recorded his parts onto analogue tape; the rest were put down digitally. With Peart having less time to record his parts, he put down 11 tracks in three days. Lifeson said Shirley adopted a &quot;very direct&quot; way of recording the instruments to capture as little resistance from the microphones to the tape machine as possible. Though various effects were explored with later, Lifeson commented on the simplicity of recording: &quot;It was just a matter of plugging into the amp and miking it&quot;. He&#x27;d resisted the idea of recording his guitars outside of the studio&#x27;s control room for the past 12 years, but Shirley talked him into playing in the studio room. After a few days, Lifeson enjoyed the experience and wanted to continue recording in this manner: &quot;You could feel the wood of the guitar vibrating against your body, and it was more susceptible to that really cool feedback, and it was your own little world; it was a little bit of an escape.&quot; Lee used his 1972 Fender jazz bass and Lifeson played Les Paul, Fender Telecaster and PRS guitar models. He often combined the Les Paul and Telecaster, along with acoustic guitars, to create a single sound.

Upon completion, the album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Gateway Mastering in Portland, Maine. The album&#x27;s title was decided upon after the music was finished. Rush had difficulty in selecting the running order on &quot;Counterparts&quot; partly due to the fact that it was easier to separate the album with two sides of a vinyl. To help, Lifeson listed each track on a magnetic board so they could play around with the order until they had one that they were happy with. Lifeson drew a graphical representation of the mood for each track which helped them select an order which Lee said helps &quot;to ease you out of the record&quot; as much of the album had an aggressive edge. The band had planned to release the album earlier but Lifeson said that would have meant starting the tour earlier, but no members were keen to do so.

&quot;Animate&quot; features Lee playing his bass with an old amplifier that was in the studio garbage and repaired by one of the studio&#x27;s technical assistants. Shirley wanted Lee to play his parts to &quot;Animate&quot; with it. &quot;It sounded great, I had a tremendous amount of energy, and all the explosion sounds of it kind of disappeared in the track, so you&#x27;re not really aware of the fact that it&#x27;s an amplifier on the verge of death.&quot; Lee liked Peart&#x27;s count in at the start of the track as it displays a &quot;human touch&quot;. Lyrically, Peart wrote the words about one person yet structured them to make it as if it may concern a relationship, &quot;almost a love song.&quot; He thought that such love lyrics had become a cliché throughout the 1980s, however, and turned to works by Jung and Camille Paglia to understand &quot;what the modern man was supposed to be.&quot; He then took Jung&#x27;s concept of anima and animus to write about a man dominating his softer, feminine side with aggression and ambition, more typical male traits. Peart said he plays a &quot;basic R&amp;B rhythm that I played back in my early days, coupled with that hypnotic effect&quot; that bands like Curve and Lush used.

&quot;Stick It Out&quot; developed from a guitar riff that Lifeson had come up with which Lee had liked, so they &quot;stretched it out a bit, added a few more things and it became that song.&quot;

&quot;Cut to the Chase&quot; is one of the few songs on the album where Lifeson&#x27;s original guide guitar solo on the demo tape was used on the final take.

&quot;Between Sun &amp; Moon&quot; features lyrics co-written by Peart and Pye Dubois, who&#x27;d also shared lyrical credits for &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Force Ten&quot;. Peart had always been welcome for Dubois to contribute ideas as he had liked his style of writing. &quot;In this case that was one that we all responded to some of the images in his presentation, so again I went to work on it, shaped it up into the kind of structure that we like to work with, and then added some of my own images and angles on it. And so it went&quot;. The music developed from a jam that had Lifeson play a riff that Lee said had a &quot;very un-Alex Lifeson sound,&quot; comparing it to the style of The Rolling Stones. Lifeson pointed out the musical bridge before his guitar solo sounds &quot;very Whoish&quot;, and named their guitarist Pete Townshend and Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards as influences.

&quot;Nobody&#x27;s Hero&quot; was inspired by a gay friend of Peart&#x27;s who worked with him during his time in London and considered his friend as a role model. For Peart, he &quot;prevented me from ever being homophobic&quot; and when they drifted apart geographically, he found out that his friend had died of AIDS. &quot;So, it&#x27;s certainly not like his life was in vain, but his heroism was in a very small arena.&quot; Collins suggested having a string section added and chose Michael Kamen to orchestrate and conduct, so Lee devised some orchestral ideas that were included in the final arrangement.

&quot;Double Agent&quot; was one of the final tracks written for the album and it was described by Lee as &quot;a complete exercise in self-indulgence.&quot; Having come up with songs that were more complex in arrangement, Lee fancied a change of pace and have a track where the band has &quot;a bit of a rave.&quot;

&quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot; is an instrumental the group decided to do because they have fun writing them as ideas get put down for them quickly. Lee and Lifeson clarified that despite the connection between it and the instrumental &quot;Where&#x27;s My Thing?&quot; from &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; where they both have &quot;Thing&quot; in the titles, there is no further link between the two. Lifeson rated the track&#x27;s melody as particularly strong.

&quot;Cold Fire&quot; went through several rewrites and Lee credited Collins in helping to put the song together by highlighting the strongest sections in the previous versions. Lee and Lifeson then got a feel into the previously difficult verses which led to Lifeson adding his steel guitar-like parts to which Lee was able to contribute harmonics. Following the difficulty, Lee rated the verses as one of the album&#x27;s strongest moments.

==Release==
Before the album was released, it premiered during a radio special hosted by Steve Warden on CILQ in Toronto on October 14, 1993.

It debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart for the week ending Nov. 6, 1993, kept out the top spot by another debuting album, Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Vs.&quot; &quot;Counterparts&quot; earned a gold certification in the United States in December 1993. The album earned a gold certification in Canada in 1994.

The band supported &quot;Counterparts&quot; with a four-month tour limited to the United States and Canada. Relations between the members were reportedly tense, and they followed the tour with a long break, during which lead singer/bass player Geddy Lee planned to spend time with his growing family, while each member explored other creative interests, such as a Lifeson solo album.

==Reception==

This album was well-received by fans and reviewers, hitting the shelves at #2 on the charts (Rush&#x27;s first album to do this), and going gold in only one month, despite being prog rock during the peak of grunge. The album did return the band to a more aggressive rock sound. Retroactively, it is seen as a typical Rush album, with strong composition and performance, but with somewhat formulaic, conservative song writing. On Spotify, Animate and Nobody&#x27;s Hero each stand out as having two to three times as many plays as the next-most-played tracks. Progarchives calls it their best album of the 1990s.

<text>Church Hill, also known as the St. John&#x27;s Church Historic District, is an Old and Historic District in Richmond, Virginia. This district encompasses the original land plat of the city of Richmond. Church Hill is the eastern terminus of Broad Street, a major east-west thoroughfare in the Richmond metropolitan area. The name &quot;Church Hill&quot; is often used to describe both the specific historic district and the larger general area in the East End encompassing other neighborhoods such as Union Hill, Chimborazo, Fairmount, Peter Paul, Woodville, etc.

==History==

=== Early United States, Civil War, and Revolution ===
Church Hill is known for Chimborazo Park, where the largest American Civil War Hospital was located. It is also known as the site of Virginia&#x27;s second revolutionary convention, where Patrick Henry gave his &quot;Give me liberty or give me death!&quot; speech in St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia in 1775.

=== 20th Century ===
On Friday, October 2, 1925, a 4,000-foot Chesapeake and Ohio railroad single track tunnel built during Reconstruction collapsed under Church Hill. The Church Hill Tunnel collapse occurred during refurbishment works, killing 3 or 4 and engulfing a work train complete with a 4-4-0 engine #231 and 10 flat cars. The tunnel was closed and filled-in after the collapse. In the July 2006, a coalition of officials and historical groups made plans to remove the buried engine. If recovered, it would be displayed at the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond. Some borings were made into the tunnel from above for examination by camera. Only murky water was found, whereupon further work was delayed by city permitting issues. The bricked-in entrance of the collapsed tunnel can still be seen at the south-east end of the alley just north of Marshall Street, on 18th Street.

Douglas Wilder, the first African American to have been elected governor of a U.S. state1, was born and raised in Church Hill.

In the 1970s, murder rates decreased overall in Richmond, Virginia, but instances of murder in Church Hill doubled.

=== 21st Century ===
In recent years, Church Hill has undergone gentrification and now experiences much lower rates of crime than it did in the late 20th century.

Church Hill is home to many small businesses, including restaurants, bars, hair salons, and boutiques. In 2014, Church Hill was named one of the &quot;10 Hot Food Neighborhoods Around the U.S&quot; by Zagat. In 2015, Redfin included Church Hill in a roundup of most walkable neighborhoods in the city—while Richmond was named #9 in their list of Top 10 Most Walkable Mid-Sized Cities.

==Preservation efforts==
The Church Hill neighborhood experienced serious physical decline during the 1950s, owing mostly to absentee landlords. The Historic Richmond Foundation was established in 1956 by Elisabeth Scott Bocock out of concern for &quot;saving and enhancing the setting for St. John&#x27;s Church.&quot; In 1957, encouraged in large part by Historic Richmond, City Council created a historic district ordinance while simultaneously adopting the St. John&#x27;s Church Old and Historic District. The preservation of Church Hill marked the formal beginning of the preservation movement in Richmond.

<doc id="570541" wikidata="Q13563196" url="?curid=570541" title="White House press corps">
<text>The White House press corps is the group of journalists, correspondents, and members of the media usually assigned to the White House in Washington, D.C., to cover the president of the United States, White House events, and news briefings. Its offices are located in the West Wing.

==Overview==
The White House press secretary, or a deputy, generally holds a weekday news briefing in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, which currently seats 49 reporters. Each seat is assigned to a news gathering organization, with the most prominent organizations occupying the first two rows. Reporters who do not have an assigned seat may stand. Often a smaller group of reporters known as the &quot;press pool&quot; is assembled to report back to their colleagues on events where the venue would make open coverage logistically difficult. There can be different pools assembled on any given day to include a pool covering the president, vice president, first lady, and other prominent members of the staff.

When a new U.S. president is elected, some news organizations change their correspondents, most often to the reporter who had been assigned to cover the new president during the preceding campaign. For example, after the 2020 United States presidential election, Peter Doocy, Fox News&#x27; lead campaign reporter during the two years that Joe Biden campaigned for president, moved on to be the chief White House correspondent for the cable news channel, replacing John Roberts, who had been chief correspondent during the presidency of Donald J. Trump.

==History==
The White House press corps had their first duties in the White House in the early 1900s. An urban legend exists of President Theodore Roosevelt noticing a group of correspondents in the rain looking for sources for their stories and inviting them into the White House. Subsequent historical research outlines how reporters were able to start with small stories in the White House and then grew their presence and influence over a span of many years.

In 1977, a court ruled in &quot;Sherrill v. Knight&quot; that the White House had a limited right to deny a press pass. In 2018, the White House withdrew the pass of Jim Acosta of CNN. CNN sued, and a federal judge temporarily ordered the pass to be restored, on grounds of due process. In May 2019, under a new standard, the White House revoked dozens of press passes.

In February 2025, the White House announced that it would determine which outlets are allowed access to the president, instead of the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association.

<doc id="570542" wikidata="Q421972" url="?curid=570542" title="Malonic acid">
<text>Malonic acid is a dicarboxylic acid with structure CH2(COOH)2. The ionized form of malonic acid, as well as its esters and salts, are known as malonates. For example, diethyl malonate is malonic acid&#x27;s diethyl ester. The name originates from the Greek word μᾶλον (&quot;malon&quot;) meaning &#x27;apple&#x27;.

==History==
Malonic acid is a naturally occurring substance found in many fruits and vegetables. There is a suggestion that citrus fruits produced in organic farming contain higher levels of malonic acid than fruits produced in conventional agriculture.

Malonic acid was first prepared in 1858 by the French chemist Victor Dessaignes via the oxidation of malic acid.

Hermann Kolbe and Hugo Müller independently discovered how to synthesize malonic acid from propionic acid, and decided to publish their results back-to-back in the Chemical Society journal in 1864. This led to priority dispute with Hans Hübner and Maxwell Simpson who had independently published preliminary results on related reactions.

==Structure and preparation==
The structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography and extensive property data including for condensed phase thermochemistry are available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
A classical preparation of malonic acid starts from chloroacetic acid:

Sodium carbonate generates the sodium salt, which is then reacted with sodium cyanide to provide the sodium salt of cyanoacetic acid via a nucleophilic substitution. The nitrile group can be hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide to sodium malonate, and acidification affords malonic acid. Industrially, however, malonic acid is produced by hydrolysis of dimethyl malonate or diethyl malonate. It has also been produced through fermentation of glucose.

==Reactions==
Malonic acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid forming amide, ester, and chloride derivatives. Malonic anhydride can be used as an intermediate to mono-ester or amide derivatives, while malonyl chloride is most useful to obtain diesters or diamides. 
In a well-known reaction, malonic acid condenses with urea to form barbituric acid. Malonic acid may also be condensed with acetone to form Meldrum&#x27;s acid, a versatile intermediate in further transformations. The esters of malonic acid are also used as a −CH2COOH synthon in the malonic ester synthesis.

===Briggs–Rauscher reaction===
Malonic acid is a key component in the Briggs–Rauscher reaction, the classic example of an oscillating chemical reaction.

===Knoevenagel condensation===
Malonic acid is used to prepare a,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids by condensation and decarboxylation. Cinnamic acids are prepared in this way:
In this, the so-called Knoevenagel condensation, malonic acid condenses with the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone, followed by a decarboxylation.

When malonic acid is condensed in hot pyridine, the condensation is accompanied by decarboxylation, the so-called Doebner modification.
===Preparation of carbon suboxide===
Malonic acid does not readily form an anhydride, dehydration gives carbon suboxide instead:
The transformation is achieved by warming a dry mixture of phosphorus pentoxide () and malonic acid. It reacts in a similar way to malonic anhydride, forming malonates.

==Applications==
Malonic acid is a precursor to specialty polyesters. It can be converted into 1,3-propanediol for use in polyesters and polymers (whose usefulness is unclear though). It can also be a component in alkyd resins, which are used in a number of coatings applications for protecting against damage caused by UV light, oxidation, and corrosion. One application of malonic acid is in the coatings industry as a crosslinker for low-temperature cure powder coatings, which are becoming increasingly valuable for heat sensitive substrates and a desire to speed up the coatings process. The global coatings market for automobiles was estimated to be $18.59 billion in 2014 with projected combined annual growth rate of 5.1% through 2022.

It is used in a number of manufacturing processes as a high value specialty chemical including the electronics industry, flavors and fragrances industry, specialty solvents, polymer crosslinking, and pharmaceutical industry. In 2004, annual global production of malonic acid and related diesters was over 20,000 metric tons. Potential growth of these markets could result from advances in industrial biotechnology that seeks to displace petroleum-based chemicals in industrial applications.

In 2004, malonic acid was listed by the US Department of Energy as one of the top 30 chemicals to be produced from biomass.

In food and drug applications, malonic acid can be used to control acidity, either as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulation or natural preservative additive for foods.

Malonic acid is used as a building block chemical to produce numerous valuable compounds, including the flavor and fragrance compounds gamma-nonalactone, cinnamic acid, and the pharmaceutical compound valproate.

Malonic acid (up to 37.5% w/w) has been used to cross-link corn and potato starches to produce a biodegradable thermoplastic; the process is performed in water using non-toxic catalysts. Starch-based polymers comprised 38% of the global biodegradable polymers market in 2014 with food packaging, foam packaging, and compost bags as the largest end-use segments.

Eastman Kodak company and others use malonic acid and derivatives as a surgical adhesive.

== Pathology ==
If elevated malonic acid levels are accompanied by elevated methylmalonic acid levels, this may indicate the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA). By calculating the malonic acid to methylmalonic acid ratio in blood plasma, CMAMMA can be distinguished from classic methylmalonic acidemia.

==Biochemistry==
Malonic acid is the precursor in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), in which it is converted to malonyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3). 

Additionally, the coenzyme A derivative of malonate, malonyl-CoA, is an important precursor in cytosolic fatty acid biosynthesis along with acetyl CoA. Malonyl CoA is formed there from acetyl CoA by the action of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the malonate is transferred to an acyl carrier protein to be added to a fatty acid chain.

Malonic acid is the classic example of a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), in the respiratory electron transport chain. It binds to the active site of the enzyme without reacting, competing with the usual substrate succinate but lacking the −CH2CH2− group required for dehydrogenation. This observation was used to deduce the structure of the active site in succinate dehydrogenase. Inhibition of this enzyme decreases cellular respiration. Since malonic acid is a natural component of many foods, it is present in mammals including humans.

==Salts and esters==

Malonic acid is diprotic; that is, it can donate two protons per molecule. Its first formula_1 is 2.8 and the second is 5.7. Thus the malonate ion can be or . Malonate or propanedioate compounds include salts and esters of malonic acid, such as
*Diethyl malonate
*Dimethyl malonate
*Disodium malonate
*Malonyl-CoA

<text>The Evil Queen (), also called the Wicked Queen or the Queen, is a fictional character and the main antagonist of &quot;Snow White&quot;, a German fairy tale recorded by the Brothers Grimm. The most popular version of the Evil Queen is the one showed in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&quot;. The first Disney villain had been voiced by Lucille La Verne.

The Evil Queen is Snow White&#x27;s stepmother. Throughout the story, she is obsessed with being &quot;the fairest in the land.” When the Queen&#x27;s magic mirror reveals that the young princess Snow White is considered more beautiful than her, the Evil Queen decides to kill Snow White using witchcraft. When this attempt fails, Snow White is rescued, and the Evil Queen is executed for her crimes. The tale is didactic, meant as a warning to young children against the dangers of narcissism, pride, and hubris, and it is a demonstration of the triumph of good over evil.

In some versions of the fairy tale, the Queen has been reworked or portrayed more sympathetically, serving as the protagonist, antihero, or tragic hero.

==Brothers Grimm tale==
The Evil Queen is described as a &quot;proud and arrogant&quot; woman with exceptional beauty, who marries the King following the death of his first wife, Snow White&#x27;s mother. The Evil Queen, obsessed with her own beauty, stands before a magic mirror every morning to confirm that she is the most beautiful, thus validating her vanity. One morning, the mirror informs her that her stepdaughter, the seven-year-old Princess Snow White, has surpassed her in beauty &quot;a thousand times&quot;. The Queen, furious, formulates a plan to kill Snow White. 

The Queen orders her Huntsman to lure Snow White into the forest to murder her. The Queen tells him to bring back the child&#x27;s lungs and liver as proof that the princess is dead. However, the Huntsman takes pity on Snow White and instead, he brings the Queen the lungs and liver of a wild boar. The Queen or (in some retellings) a cook prepares the lungs and liver, believing them to be Snow White&#x27;s organs, and the Queen eats them.

After questioning her mirror again, the Queen discovers that Snow White has survived and has found sanctuary with the Seven Dwarfs. Intending to kill Snow White herself, she takes on the disguise of an old peddler woman. Under this guise, she visits the dwarfs&#x27; house and sells Snow White laces for a corset. The Queen intentionally laces the corset too tight in an attempt to suffocate Snow White. When this fails, the Queen returns again, this time as a comb seller, and tricks Snow White into using a poisoned comb created through the art of witchcraft. However, the comb also fails to kill Snow White, and in response to this failure, the Queen proclaims, &quot;Snow White shall die... even if it costs me my life!&quot; She again visits Snow White, disguised as a farmer&#x27;s wife, and gives her half of a red, beautiful apple that had been poisoned. The poisoned apple places Snow White in a deep sleep.

Snow White is awakened by a kiss from a Prince from another kingdom, and they invite the Queen to their wedding. Although she fears what will happen, the Queen&#x27;s jealousy drives her to attend. At the celebration, she is forced to put on red-hot iron shoes and dance until she drops dead.

===Violence and Sanitization ===
In the classic ending of &quot;Snow White&quot;, the Evil Queen is put to death by torture. The first English translation of the Grimm&#x27;s tale, written by Edgar Taylor in 1823, has the Queen choke on her own envy upon the sight of Snow White alive. An 1871 English translation by Susannah Mary Paull &quot;replaces the Queen&#x27;s death by cruel physical punishment with death by self-inflicted pain and self-destruction,&quot; as it is instead her own shoes that become hot due to her anger. Other alternative endings have the Queen instantly drop dead &quot;of anger&quot; at the wedding or in front of her mirror upon learning of Snow White&#x27;s survival, fall victim to her own designs going awry (such as through touching her own poisoned rose), die by nature (e.g., falling into quicksand while crossing a swamp on her way back to the castle after poisoning Snow White), be killed by the dwarfs during a chase, be destroyed by her own mirror, run away into the forest never to be seen again, or simply be banished from the kingdom forever. Today, such extreme punishment is often considered inappropriate for children. As Sara Maitland wrote, &quot;We do not tell this part of the story anymore; we say it is too cruel and will break children&#x27;s soft hearts&quot;.

Many modern revisions of the fairy tale change the gruesome classic ending in order to make it less violent. In some versions, the Queen is merely prevented from committing further wrong-doings and does not die but is banished or disappears; in others, she may die by accident. Fawzia Gilani-Williams&#x27;s &quot;Snow White: An Islamic Tale&quot;, for instance, has Snow White forgive her evil witch stepmother entirely, making her repent and redeem herself, as part of the book&#x27;s religious lessons for children. 

Such revisions have been considered a softening of the original text; a 2014 nationwide UK poll opined that today&#x27;s stories are too &quot;sanitized&quot; for children.Sheldon Cashdan, Professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, argues that in accordance with the logic of fairy tales, the Queen could not be allowed to flee or merely be locked up, as fairy tale narrative demands that &quot;the reader needs to know that the death of the witch is thorough and complete, even if it means exposing young readers to acts of violence that are extreme by contemporary standards&quot;. Conversely, writers such as Oliver Madox Hueffer have expressed sympathy for the queen, or, like psychology professor Sharna Olfman, have removed the violence when reading the story to children, while also acknowledging that verbal storytelling lacks &quot;graphic visual imagery&quot;.
===Origins and evolution===
In the first print edition of the Brothers Grimm story from their 1812/1815 collection &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s and Household Tales&quot;), the Queen is Snow White&#x27;s biological mother. At the beginning of the story, she is sewing at an open window when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the white snow on the black ebony windowsill. She then wishes to have a daughter with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, and she later gives birth to Snow White (Snow Drop). In subsequent versions after 1819, this was changed; the text was added to include that Snow White&#x27;s mother died and the King remarried. According to Jack Zipes, that change was made because the Grimms &quot;held motherhood sacred&quot;. According to Cashdan, a &quot;cardinal rule of fairy tales&quot; mandates that the &quot;heroes and heroines are allowed to kill witches, sorceresses, even stepmothers, but never their own mothers&quot;. Zipes&#x27; 2014 collection of Grimm fairy tales in their original forms reinstated the Queen as Snow White&#x27;s mother. This revision was likely the work of Wilhelm Grimm. In the Brothers&#x27; original Ölenberg Manuscript (1810), the Queen herself abandons Snow White in a forest and ends up being punished by the returning King after he revives their daughter.

However, the wicked stepmother was not unknown in German versions predating the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s collection. In 1782, Johann Karl August Musäus published a literary fairy tale titled &quot;Richilde&quot; which reimagined the folktale from the villain&#x27;s point of view. The main character is Richilde, arrogant Countess of Brabant, who as a child received the gift of a magic mirror invented by her godfather Albertus Magnus. Many elements of the Grimms&#x27; Snow White appear in this story, including the wicked stepmother, the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, and the punishment of dancing in red-hot shoes. The Grimms knew of &quot;Snow White&quot; (1809), a play by their contemporary and rival Albert Ludwig Grimm (no relation to the Brothers Grimm), which according to Zipes &quot;treated the Queen more gently&quot;.

Hueffer noted that the wicked stepmother with magical powers threatening a young princess is a recurring theme in fairy tales; one similar character is the witch-queen in &quot;The Wild Swans&quot; as told by Hans Christian Andersen. According to Kenny Klein, the enchantress Ceridwen of the Welsh mythology was &quot;the quintessential evil stepmother, the origin of that character in the two tales of Snow White and Cinderella&quot;.

Equivalents to the Evil Queen can be found in Snow White-like tales from around the world. In the Scottish Gaelic oral tale &quot;Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree&quot;, the Queen is named Silver-Tree and is the heroine&#x27;s biological mother. A talking trout takes the place of the Queen&#x27;s mirror and the huntsman figure (often her lover in non-Grimm versions) is the princess&#x27;s own father. The villain&#x27;s relationship with Snow White can also vary, with versions from around the world sometimes featuring wicked sisters, wicked sisters-in-law, or a wicked mother of the prince. One early variation of the tale was Giambattista Basile&#x27;s &quot;The Young Slave&quot; (1634). In this telling the heroine&#x27;s mother is unintentionally involved in putting her to sleep. She is then awoken by her cruel and jealous aunt who treats her like a slave. Furthermore, the Evil Queen&#x27;s tricks also vary from place to place. In Italy, she is found using a toxic comb, a contaminated cake, and a suffocating braid. In France, she is found using a poisoned tomato. There are many more examples. The Queen demands varying proof from the huntsman. In Spain, Snow White can be found needing to stop a bottle of blood with her toe; in Italy, it is the princess&#x27;s intestines and blood-soaked shirt.

===Interpretations===
According to some scholars, such as Roger Sale and University of Hawaii professor Cristina Bacchilega, the story has ageist undertones vilifying the older woman character, with her envy of Snow White&#x27;s beauty. Terri Windling wrote that the Queen is &quot;a woman whose power is derived from her beauty; it is this, the tale implies, that provides her place in the castle&#x27;s hierarchy. If the king’s attention turns from his wife to another, what power is left to an aging woman? Witchcraft, the tale answers. Potions, poisons, and self-protection.&quot;

Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar regard Snow White and her mother/stepmother as two female stereotypes, the angel and the monster. The fact that the Queen was Snow White&#x27;s biological mother in the first version of the Grimms&#x27; story has led several psychoanalytic critics to interpret &quot;Snow White&quot; as a story about a repressed Oedipus complex, or about Snow White&#x27;s Electra complex and sexual rivalry with the Queen. According to Bruno Bettelheim, the story&#x27;s main motif is &quot;the clash of sexual innocence and sexual desire&quot;: &quot;whereas Snow White achieves inner harmony, her stepmother fails to do so. Unable to integrate the social and the antisocial aspects of human nature, she remains enslaved to her desires and gets caught up in an Oedipal competition with her daughter from which she cannot extricate herself. This imbalance between her contradictory drives proves to be her undoing.&quot; Cashdan interprets the Queen&#x27;s motives as &quot;fear that the king will find Snow White more appealing than her.&quot; This struggle so dominates the psychological landscape of the tale that Gilber and Gubar even proposed renaming the story &quot;Snow White and Her Wicked Stepmother&quot;. Harold Bloom opined that the three &quot;temptations&quot; all &quot;testify to a mutual sexual attraction between Snow White and her stepmother.&quot;

It seems that the Brothers Grimm, who wrote their book as an &quot;educational manual&quot; (&quot;Erziehungsbuch&quot;), felt that a brutal punishment for a villain was a necessary element augmenting the happy endings of their tales, as in Snow White&#x27;s ascent as new queen and triumph over her evil enemy. Cashdan proposes that the evil queen &quot;embodies narcissism, and the young princess, with whom readers identify, embodies parts of the child struggling to overcome this tendency. Vanquishing the queen represents a triumph of positive forces in the self over vain impulses.&quot; As such, &quot;the death of the witch signals a victory of virtue over vice, a sign that positive forces in the self have prevailed.&quot; In addition, &quot;the active involvement of heroin in the witch&#x27;s demise communicates to readers that they must take an active role in overcoming their own errant tendencies.&quot; Similarly, psychologist Betsy Cohen wrote about the perceived symbolism of the act: &quot;In order to avoid becoming a wicked queen herself, Snow White needs to separate from and kill off this destructive force inside of her.&quot; In the words of Bettelheim, &quot;only the death of the jealous queen (the elimination of all outer and inner turbulence) can make for a happy world.&quot;

Regarding the manner of the Queen&#x27;s execution, scholars such as Cashdan, Sheldon Donald Haase, and John Hanson Saunders argue that from psychological and storytelling perspectives, the Queen&#x27;s punishment fits her crimes, gives closure to the reader, and shows good triumphing over evil. Jo Eldridge Carney, Professor of English at The College of New Jersey, wrote: &quot;Again, the fairy tale&#x27;s system of punishment is horrific but apt: a woman so actively consumed with seeking affirmation from others and with violently undoing her rival is forced to enact her own physical destruction as a public spectacle.&quot; Likewise, Mary Ayers of the Stanford University School of Medicine wrote that the red-hot shoes symbolize that the Queen was &quot;subjected to the effects of her own inflamed, searing hot envy and hatred.&quot; It was also noted that this ending echoes the fairy tale of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, which similarly &quot;warns of the danger of attachment to appearances&quot;.

Rosemary Ellen Guiley suggests that the Queen of the Brothers Grimm tale uses an apple because it recalls the temptation of Eve; this creation story from the Bible led the Christian Church to view apples as a symbol of sin. Many people feared that apples could carry evil spirits and that witches used them for poisoning. Robert G. Brown of Duke University also makes a connection with the story of Adam and Eve, seeing the Queen as a representation of the archetype of Lilith. The symbol of the apple has long had traditional associations with enchantment and witchcraft in some European cultures, as in the case of Morgan le Fay&#x27;s Avalon (&quot;Isle of the Apples&quot;).

Diane Purkiss attributes the Queen&#x27;s fiery death in the Brothers Grimm tale to &quot;the folk belief that burning a witch&#x27;s body ended her power, a belief which subtended (but did not cause) the practice of burning witches in Germany.&quot; The American Folklore Society noted that the use of iron shoes &quot;recalls folk practices of destroying a witch through the magic agency of iron.&quot; In other variants of the &quot;Snow White&quot; type tales, the story usually also ends with the punishment of the wicked stepmother through burning, immurement, or decapitation.

==Adaptations==
The Queen&#x27;s character is portrayed in a variety of ways in subsequent adaptations of the original fairy tale. Lana Berkowitz of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; noted: &quot;Today stereotypes of the evil queen and innocent Snow White often are challenged. Rewrites may show the queen is reacting to extenuating circumstances.&quot; In addition, according to Scott Meslow of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Disney&#x27;s decision to throw out the Grimm&#x27;s appropriately grim ending—which sentences the evil queen to dance in heated iron shoes until her death—has meant that ending is all but forgotten.&quot; However, this change was not unique to Disney: already in Taylor&#x27;s 1923 &quot;German Popular Stories&quot;, the very first translation of the Grimms&#x27; tale into English, the Queen, while remaining just as much a sinister figure as in the original text, simply chokes to death out of anger (Taylor avoided giving cruel punishments for the villains throughout the book).

===Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White&quot; franchise===

In The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s seminal 1937 animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, the Queen, usually known as the Evil Queen or the Wicked Queen, is sometimes referred to as Queen Grimhilde in Disney publications from the 1930s and was originally voiced by Lucille La Verne. In the film, similar to the Brothers Grimm story, the Queen is vain and wants to be the &quot;fairest in the land&quot;. She envies her stepdaughter&#x27;s beauty and the attention of the Prince from another land. Disney&#x27;s changes also include the expansion of her magical powers (including control over elements of nature, conjuring wind, and thunder as ingredients for her spell) and placing her as the master of the spirit in her magic mirror (even referred to by the Queen as her &quot;slave&quot;). As in the fairy tale, the Queen&#x27;s jealousy leads her to plot Snow White&#x27;s death, and leads to her own when she falls to her death shortly after poisoning Snow White. The Disney version of the Queen character uses her magic to transform herself into an old woman instead of just taking a disguise like in the Grimms&#x27; story; with this appearance, she is commonly referred to as the Wicked Witch or alternatively as the Old Hag or just the Witch. The film&#x27;s version of the Queen was created by Walt Disney and Joe Grant, originally animated by Art Babbit, and voiced by Lucille La Verne. Inspiration for her design came from several sources, including the characters of Queen Hash-a-Motep from &quot;She&quot; and Princess Kriemhild from &quot;Die Nibelungen&quot;, as well as actresses such as Joan Crawford and Gale Sondergaard.

Besides the film, the Evil Queen has made numerous appearances in Disney productions and attractions, such as &quot;Fantasmic!&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom Keepers&quot;, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;, sometimes appearing alongside Maleficent from &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. The Queen has since been voiced by Eleanor Audley, Louise Chamis, and Susanne Blakeslee. She was portrayed live by Anne Francine, Jane Curtin, and Olivia Wilde, among others. Her surviving and aged version was portrayed by Kathy Najimy in &quot;Descendants&quot;. The film&#x27;s version of the Queen has become a popular archetype; visually embodying the fairy tale character in popular consciousness, and influenced a number of artists and non-Disney works, and even Walt Disney&#x27;s very own next villainess, Maleficent. Gal Gadot is set to portray the Queen in &quot;Snow White&quot;, Disney&#x27;s own 2025 live-action film reimagining of the 1937 film.

=== Live-action film and television ===

==== 1916-2000 ====
The 1916 American silent film &quot;Snow White&quot; is an early example of an altered ending to the story, as the Queen is not executed but merely banished from the court after breaking her demonic mirror in anger.

The 1962 East German film &quot;Snow White&quot; changes the ending as well. The Queen, played by Marianne Christina Schilling, arrives at Snow White&#x27;s wedding where the Prince offers her a half of a red apple, which she assumes is poisoned. Terrified, the Queen flees and is chased out of the country by the Prince. 

In the 1961 film &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot;, the Queen of Fortunia is played by Patricia Medina. The Queen&#x27;s character is similar to the fairy tale, however, the princess is protected by the Three Stooges. When the Queen attempts to track down and destroy Snow White, the Stooges spot her flying on a broom and kill her by using a magic wish which causes her to crash and burn. Her companion in the film, the wizard Oga, is also killed when he falls into a pot of boiling oil.

In the 1962 Mexican children&#x27;s film, &quot;Tom Thumb and Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, Snow White&#x27;s stepmother appears as the Witch Queen, &quot;Reina Bruja&quot;, the mistress of all evil and the queen of all monsters in the world, played by Ofelia Guilmáin. The Queen looks similar to the Queen in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; but she has a green face like Maleficent from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. She dies when the Little Red Riding Hood tricks her to fall into a furnace-like shrine of the Devil at her castle.

Another inspired character is from the 1999 film &quot;The Queen of the Lake&quot;, which mixes the fairy tales of Grimm and those of Hans Christian Andersen. The Queen plots to marry the young Prince Victor so she can become the most powerful ruler in the world. Victor discovers the Queen has magically kidnapped seven young princesses so they could not become her rivals. He manages to rescue the princesses and defeat the Queen, turning her to stone.

In the Snow White episode of the 1984 television series &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, Vanessa Redgrave&#x27;s Queen argues with the film&#x27;s narrator about the plot. She is ultimately punished with a spell that drives her to insanity by preventing her from ever seeing her reflection again. The 1987 American musical film &quot;Snow White&quot; stars Diana Rigg as the Queen. The plot follows the story of the fairy tale closely but again modifies the ending. When the Queen is invited to Snow White&#x27;s wedding, she breaks the mirror in rage, causing her to age rapidly. After arriving at the wedding, as the mirror falls apart, she shatters into pieces and disintegrates.

In the 1987-1988 television series &quot;The Charmings&quot;, a sequel to the fairy tale, Queen Lillian &quot;Lily&quot; White, portrayed by Judy Parfitt, returns from a bottomless pit to cast a powerful curse on Snow White and her family. This curse banishes them all (including the Queen herself and her Magic Mirror) into the modern world, where they live as the titular Charmings. The Queen is forced to live with Snow White, while trying to return to their own world.

In the 1997 Gothic horror film &quot;Snow White: A Tale of Terror&quot;, exploring the wicked stepmother&#x27;s backstory and personality as its &quot;quasi-central&quot; character in an antithesis to the Disney version. She is not a queen, but rather a tragic noblewoman named Lady Claudia Hoffman, portrayed by Sigourney Weaver. Unlike the usual Snow White stepmother character, she is obsessed with motherhood rather than her appearance. Lady Claudia, daughter of a witch (who the film suggests had been burned at the stake by the knights of the kingdom), marries widower Count Frederick and tries to befriend his daughter Lilli, who rejects her. When Claudia is pregnant, Lilli receiving all of the attention causes her so much stress that the baby is stillborn. Driven mad by grief Claudia listens to her mother&#x27;s magic mirror and blames Lilli for the baby&#x27;s death and shows her own reflection distorted and deformed, driving the countess to her crimes and possessing her. Claudia&#x27;s various magic powers greatly surpass those of the Brothers Grimms Queen. She successfully seduces Lilly&#x27;s suitor Dr Gutenberg and begins to plot the death of her stepdaughter and later also the king. Claudia sends her mute, inbred brother Gustav to kill the princess (his role replacing that of the Hunter from the fairy tale). When her mirror tells her that Lilli is alive, she uses magic to kill her brother and to try to bring her child back to life. Claudia learns of Lilly&#x27;s whereabouts and attempts to kill her and the seven miners with whom Lilly hides. She then gives Lilli a poisoned apple, placing her in a coma. When Lilli awakens she and the remaining miners confront Claudia. Lilli kills her stepmother by stabbing her image in the mirror, causing Claudia to rapidly age and catch fire before she is crushed by debris. The film has been noted as innovative in that the Queen&#x27;s jealousy is first provoked by Snow White&#x27;s own jealousy towards her. Weaver said about her role: &quot;It was vitally 
important to me to make it clear that Claudia and Frederick are madly in 
love at the beginning and that&#x27;s what Lilli resents. Then when she changes 
from perfect wife into the worthless mother of a stillborn child, that&#x27;s when she looks hideous in the mirror and blames Lilli for everything. The key to Claudia is that she starts out as normal as the rest of us. She isn&#x27;t evil.&quot;

&quot;Willa: An American Snow White&quot;, a 1998 television reimagined version of the fairy tale takes place in the American South around 1915, featuring a retired stage star Regina Worthington (played by Caitlin O&#x27;Connell). Regina (Latin for &quot;queen&quot;) is jealous of her stepdaughter, Willa, who has ambitions to become an actress and attempts to gain Regina&#x27;s approval. The stepmother&#x27;s mirror is not magic but a regular mirror in which she sees her young and beautiful image due to insanity. After Regina notices that Willa is more beautiful than her, she orders her butler Otto to kill Willa, but Otto drives Willa into a forest where she takes refuge with a traveling show. Regina murders Otto and then attempts to murder Willa, who is playing Snow White in a skit. Willa is saved by the &quot;elixir of life&quot; of the fake Indian chief Wonka that the demented Regina drinks before accidentally setting fire to the stage and herself. Willa is subsequently cast in a moving picture while Tonka, who claims to have seen Regina perform, says that she was described as &quot;the tragic queen&quot; and that she serves as a cautionary tale against &quot;the corrosive effects of fame and fortune.&quot; Regina&#x27;s character is based not only on the Queen but also on Norma Desmond. Another modern rendition of the fairy tale, also devoid of magical motifs, is the Slovak television musical &quot;Let the Princess Stay with Us&quot; (&quot;Neberte nám princeznú&quot;). In it, the Queen&#x27;s role is taken by the protagonist Katka&#x27;s biological mother, played by Marie Rottrová.

The main villain of the 2000 miniseries &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; is Christine White, more commonly referred to as the Evil Queen and portrayed by Dianne Wiest. Two hundred years after the events of the original Snow White fairy tale, the original Evil Queen, who had been left for death, uses her mirrors to spy on Earth, where she finds Christine Lewis, a troubled former socialite whose husband Tony lost their fortune through bad investments and whose daughter Virginia was unplanned. After almost killing her daughter in a psychotic break, Christine joins the Queen (now an undead hag known as the Swamp Witch) in the realm of the Nine Kingdoms to be groomed as an apprentice and to be her successor. Christine then inserts herself into the House of White, first as the nanny of Snow White&#x27;s grandson, Prince Wendell White, and later as his stepmother. She&#x27;s then imprisoned for the murder of Wendell&#x27;s father. As &quot;The 10th Kingdom&quot; begins, she escapes to act as antagonist until her death by Virginia.

==== 2001-2020s ====
In the 2001 television film &quot;Snow White: The Fairest of Them All&quot;, a self-loathing crone named Elspeth (Miranda Richardson and Karin Konoval in her crone form), who is a genie, is transformed into a beautiful queen by her brother. She becomes jealous when the mirror reveals that her stepdaughter Snow White is the fairest in the land and in this adaptation she is driven more by insecurities than vanity. She also envies the affection that Prince Alfred shows towards Snow White. She disguises herself as Snow White&#x27;s deceased mother Josephine (Vera Farmiga) and succeeds in poisoning her with an apple. Elspeth then shatters the mirror in rage which breaks her spells and turns her back into the old crone. She is then killed by the dwarves whom she had once turned into statues.

Nina Hagen portrayed the Queen in the 2004 German comedy film &quot;7 Dwarves – Men Alone in the Wood&quot;, a loose adaptation of the fairy tale, and its 2006 sequel &quot;7 Dwarves: The Forest Is Not Enough&quot;. In the latter the Queen&#x27;s character is known as the Witch after having been dethroned and the main villain is instead Rumpelstiltskin. It is a parody story in which for example the poisoned apple scene is replaced by the one involving the Queen pretending to be a door-to-door salesperson of supposed youth-preserving coffins to trick Snow White, played by Nina Hagen&#x27;s real life daughter, Cosma Shiva Hagen. The two live-action films were followed by 2014&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Seventh Dwarf&quot;, in which her character was given the name Dellamorta. In it, she ends up accidentally defeated by the eponymous dwarf Bubi and turned into an ice figure.

In the 2005 historical fantasy film &quot;The Brothers Grimm&quot;, Monica Bellucci plays the villainous character that will inspire the fairytale Evil Queen after the Brothers themselves face her in Napoleonic-era Germany. Known as the Thuringian Queen or the Mirror Queen. She was the extremely vain wife of the Frankish king Childeric I, obsessed with preserving her youth and beauty that is otherwise only preserved in her magic mirror. This leads her to dabble in black magic, which backfires when she acquires a spell for eternal life that does not grant her eternal youth. Since then, she has been living in a tower organizing abductions of young girls so she can use their blood to regain her youth and beauty. The Queen is destroyed after Jake Grimm shatters the mirror in the tower, making her werewolf minion transform into the woodsman (the Hunter figure) and destroy the rest of the mirror by jumping out of the tower&#x27;s window with it.

In the 2007 teen comedy film, &quot;Sydney White&quot;, Sara Paxton plays Rachel Witchburn, the mean leader of the student council and the head of the sorority that Sydney wants to attend. Jealous of Sydney, Rachel hires a hacker to destroy Sydney&#x27;s computer files using a virus called The Poison Apple. Nevertheless, Sydney wins the debate and the election, becoming the new president, while Rachel is stripped of her sisterhood because of her cruelty.

In all seven seasons of the 2011–2017 American TV series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, the Queen, also known as Regina Mills and portrayed by Lana Parrilla, transforms from an antagonist into a central character. Regina saves Snow White&#x27;s life when they are younger, leading to Regina&#x27;s unwilling marriage to Snow&#x27;s father. When Snow inadvertently causes the death of Regina&#x27;s true love, Regina grows vengeful and becomes the Evil Queen. After years of failing to kill Snow White, the Evil Queen eventually casts the Dark Curse, provided by her mentor Rumpelstiltskin, sending all the fairytale characters to the real world and erasing their true memories. During the curse, Regina adopts a son, Henry. Later, Regina&#x27;s curse is broken by Snow White&#x27;s daughter, Emma (Henry&#x27;s biological mother), and Regina decides to try and redeem herself for her son. In time, Regina manages to make amends with Snow White, Emma, and her other enemies. She also meets her long-lost half-sister, Zelena the Wicked Witch, and falls in love with Robin Hood. In the fifth season, following Robin&#x27;s death, Regina uses Dr. Jekyll&#x27;s serum to separate herself from the darkness within her, creating the Evil Queen as a separate individual. In the seventh season, set many years later, Regina is crowned the Good Queen when the realms are united.

In the 2012 comedy fantasy film &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;, Julia Roberts plays Queen Clementianna, a comical and sympathetic version of the character framing the film&#x27;s plot through her ironic and cynical prologue and epilogue narration where she insists on presenting it as her story. She is a cold and narcissistic woman who married the king and bewitched him into a savage beast using a magic necklace. The Queen spends her time organizing lavish parties in the palace and buying expensive dresses while neglecting the kingdom which has caused the people to struggle and live in poverty due to high taxes imposed on them by her. She uses a magic mirror to talk to a much younger reflection of herself (played by Lisa Roberts Gillan) who often warns her not to use her magic for selfish short-sighted purposes. Such as using total control over their husband and Prince Alcott or turning her servant Brighton into a cockroach as punishment. In her attempts to kill her 18-years-old stepdaughter Snow White, the Queen creates two wooden puppets to attack the dwarves&#x27; home as well as commanding the Beast to attack. Once Snow defeats the beast, the Queen begins to rapidly age as her reflection states that she must pay the price for her use of magic. When Snow White then refuses the poisoned apple when offered by the crone-queen at her wedding, Clementianna herself eats it and dissolves, while the mirror portal shatters. One character in the film calls her a &quot;good old-fashioned, plain, traditional psycho crazy.&quot; Director Tarsem Singh states the mirror world is her own delusion: &quot;She&#x27;s just insecure ... about beauty, about things that are passing her by, and now she wants power. If she looks into the mirror ... she enters the landscape, which is a mindscape, and in there is a house, inside which are many mirrors, and in those mirrors she just talks to herself. So it&#x27;s actually just her talking to herself. She&#x27;s just bad, but wants to outsource the evil and say &#x27;That thing told me.

2012 saw the release of multiple Snow White films. In &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Snow White&quot;, the evil queen&#x27;s name is Queen Gwendolyn (played by Jane March). She plans to marry Prince Alexander, so she must kill her stepdaughter Snow White who loves him as well. When she attempts to forcibly marry Alexander, Snow White manages to break free and decapitate her before the ceremony can be finished.

Maribel Verdú plays Encarna, the evil stepmother of Carmen Villalta also known as Snow White in the Spanish silent art film &quot;Blancanieves&quot; that transplants the story to the 1920s Andalusia and strips it of any magic. Encarna eventually poisons Snow White at a bullfighting ring and is herself killed by the dwarf bullfighters when they trap her with a bull. &quot;Snow White: A Deadly Summer&quot; is a modern-day re-imagining of the story as a slasher horror film where Maureen McCormick plays Eve, the psychopathic woman who hates her stepdaughter because she wants Snow&#x27;s father all for herself.

In a major 2012 retelling, &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot;, Charlize Theron portrays Queen Ravenna, an extremely powerful sorceress on a misandrous vendetta after having been sexually abused by powerful men in the past. The Queen is depicted as a vain, scheming, and power-hungry secret leader of a supernatural army whom King Magnus &quot;rescues&quot;. On their wedding night, she brutally murders the King and everyone in the castle but the young Snow White. Conquering yet another kingdom with her younger brother Finn, Ravenna later fears that Snow White may challenge her reign of terror. The Queen&#x27;s obsession with power and beauty stems from childhood trauma when her mother tells her that beauty is a weapon. The strength of her powers seems to correlate to her appearance, which she retains by stealing life force from young women. Both her powers and beauty begin to fade as Snow White comes into her own. Her Magic Mirror assures her that the only way to render her powers and her youth permanent is to consume Snow White&#x27;s heart. She is ultimately killed when she is stabbed by Snow White, aided by Eric the Huntsman, rapidly aging as she dies. Director Rupert Sanders said: &quot;It was very important that we didn&#x27;t have a terrible cut-out villain. We had someone who was doing evil things out of a fear and weakness. I think it is important that you do sympathize with her to a degree, but also really understand why she is the person she’s become because she wasn&#x27;t born evil. It was a journey for her to become evil, and I think it was very important to myself and Charlize Theron to play a realistic version of the queen.&quot; Theron said about the character: &quot;At first, I didn&#x27;t really understand why she was evil or losing her mind, but once I understood that it wasn&#x27;t just the fact that her mortality relied upon finding Snow White, and that knowing that and not being able to do anything and being stuck in a castle. Well, I think that would be maddening for somebody like her. It reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character in &quot;The Shining&quot;that idea that you&#x27;re stuck in this place and you can&#x27;t escape it, that cabin fever.&quot; Theron reprised her role in the film&#x27;s 2016 sequel, &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot;, in which the Queen was revealed to have hidden part of herself in the Mirror. Allowing her to be restored to life by her younger sister, the Snow Queen-like &quot;ice princess&quot; Freya. Freya learns that Ravenna had killed her child whom the Mirror said would grow up more beautiful than Ravenna. The sisters fatally duel each other, enabling Eric to break the Mirror as Ravenna shatters into pieces.

In the 2025 Disney live-action musical fantasy film Snow White (2025 film), Gal Gadot portrays the Evil Queen. &quot;Snow White&quot; is scheduled to be released in theaters in the United States by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures on March 21, 2025.

=== Animated film and television ===
One early yet notable animated adaptation was &quot;Snow White&quot; (1933), a &quot;Betty Boop&quot; series cartoon short in which the Queen is a vain and conniving witch who resembles Olive Oyl. At one point, her mirror explodes in a puff of magic smoke that changes her into a hideous dragon that chases the protagonists until the Queen&#x27;s own former guard grabs the dragon&#x27;s tongue and turns her inside out, revealing her skeleton. Another early American animation, &quot;Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs&quot; (1943), is a controversial World War II propaganda short that reimagines all the story&#x27;s characters as African-Americans. The &quot;mean ol&#x27; queen&quot; of the story (voiced by Ruby Dandridge and Danny Webb), a parody of the Disney character, plots to murder &quot;So White&quot; out of jealousy for the handsome &quot;Prince Chawmin,&quot; representing food hoarders at the time of war rationing.

The Wicked Queen is voiced by Melendy Britt in the 1980 Filmation animated television film &quot;A Snow White Christmas&quot;, a loose sequel set years after the events of the fairy tale in which the Queen returns to life after having been trapped in ice. Determined to get rid of the now ruling Queen Snow White and King Charming, as well as their daughter (who is also named Snow White), the Queen freezes the entire kingdom. The young princess escapes and enlists the help of the seven friendly giants to stop the Queen again. Each time, the Queen&#x27;s attempts to harm the young Snow White with her evil magic are foiled by the new protectors of the princess. Eventually, the Queen resorts to disguise herself as an old giant woman to trick Snow White into smelling the scent of a poisoned flower. Having found Snow White dead, the enraged giants attack the Queen&#x27;s castle, which is being protected by demons. One of the giants, Hicker, causes an earthquake that shatters the magic mirror that was the source of the Queen&#x27;s life and power, breaking all of her spells and returning all of her victims to life as she is finally vanquished. It is unrelated to another Filmation sequel to the fairy tale (and, unofficially, to the Disney film), the 1989 &quot;Happily Ever After&quot;, in which the late Queen&#x27;s brother, the evil wizard Lord Maliss, arrives in the kingdom to avenge his sister on those responsible for her demise: Snow White and Prince Charming. Due to pressure by Disney lawyers, the Queen herself does not appear in person and is only shown via a portrait and a bust statue. The film begins with her monster minions partying and celebrating her death, and Lord Maliss is eventually destroyed after being turned into a stone statue following his transformation into a dragon.

In the &quot;Snow White&quot; episode of the 1987 anime series &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tale Classics&quot;, the Queen is voiced by Arlene Banas in the English dub. While the Queen&#x27;s plans to dispose of her stepdaughter through the Huntsman and the purple laces remains intact in this version, the old hag potion and poison apple are instead given to Snow White by an old witch allied with the Queen. As the Queen leaves the Seven Dwarfs&#x27; house after Snow White eats the poison apple, she is spotted by Snow White&#x27;s friend Klaus and the Prince, who both chase her down and attack her. While this version of the Queen has no magical abilities, she displays great martial prowess as she fights them off until they are joined by the many wolf friends and the Seven Dwarfs. The narrator tells that the Queen then fought the wolves &quot;like a lioness&quot; until they finally killed her.

The 1991 animated film &quot;The Magic Riddle&quot; combines the story of Snow White with several other fairy tales in which the Queen figure is a widowed stepmother played by Robyn Moore. She plans to marry her biological daughter, Bertha, to the handsome young Phillipe, but he is in love with her stepdaughter Cindy (a figure combing Snow White with Cinderella) who is aided by her grandmother. Following the advice of her magic mirror, the stepmother disguises herself as a salesman and visits the grandmother in the woods, tricking her into entering a castle where she becomes trapped inside it. Later, Phillipe and the Dwarfs find themselves confined in the castle as well. The stepmother, wearing another disguise devised by her magic mirror, hypnotises Cindy with a magic apple to fall asleep, but accidentally falls into a well during the commotion. Eventually, Cindy and Phillipe&#x27;s wedding is held at what used to be her stepmother&#x27;s house, where she and her daughter are to serve as maids just as Cindy used to.

In the 1994-1995 anime television series &quot;The Legend of Snow White&quot;, Lady Chrystal (voiced by Mari Yokoo), a woman famed for her beauty and ruler of a small neighbouring kingdom, comes to the Emerald Valley in order to marry King Conrad. As in the fairy tale, she turns out to be an evil and jealous woman who uses the black art of witchcraft to eliminate her rivals and obtain what she desires most: beauty and power. After the king&#x27;s departure, the evil Queen Chrystal, aided by her bat familiar, attempts to kill Snow White, but the princess ends up in the care of the Seven Dwarfs. Chrystal then tries to take the life of Snow White several times. During the final attempt, she instead uses an apple to put her hated rival in an enchanted sleep in order to take over her youthful body for her own. Eventually, the Queen turns out to be an unknowing puppet of her demonic grandmother, Lady Helene, a powerful and immortal witch and the true source of the Queen&#x27;s magic, appearing as the Evil Spirit inside her mirror. Twenty years prior, the aging Helene had found a way to keep herself forever young and beautiful: by repeatedly taking possession of another body and transferring her soul into it. In this way, she planned to partake in an endless cycle of self-serving sacrifice to satisfy her vanity. The first victim of this ambition was her niece Chrystal, who, on her 12th birthday, had her soul imprisoned in the mirror to allow the evil witch to manipulate the future Evil Queen&#x27;s mind and actions. In the present, Snow White&#x27;s fiancé Prince Richard manages to kill Helene in a desperate fight, saving not only his beloved but also freeing Chrystal from the evil influence.

The Evil Queen, voiced by Susanne Blakeslee, appears in the 2007 animated film &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; in which she joins the team of Prince Charming to take over Far Far Away, but redeems herself by the end, saying she always wanted to start a spa in France. She also appears in the &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; video game as one of the bosses Shrek and his team have to defeat. In the 2009 animated film &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After 2: Snow White Another Bite @ the Apple&quot;, Cindy Robinson voices the would-be Queen, Lady Vain. She seduces King Cole in order to rule the kingdom herself and is aided by Rumpelstiltskin. Wanting Snow White removed from the kingdom, Vain opts not to poison her; instead, she uses magic to compel Snow White to spread vicious gossip so that everyone in the kingdom will turn against her. Nevertheless, Snow White manages to foil Lady Vain&#x27;s marriage ceremony and expose her as a witch.

Gina Gershon voiced Queen Regina in the English version of the 2019 Korean animated film &quot;Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. In it, she was brought to King White&#x27;s castle accused of being a witch for punishment, but the king, bewitched by her beauty, fell for her. After Regina married the king and became the new queen, people begin to disappear. Her husband finds out that she is indeed an evil witch and she turns him into a giant wooden bunny. When Snow White steals the red shoes that grant immortality and eternal beauty to Queen Regina and escapes the castle, the witch is furious and tries to find her using the Magic Mirror and her ally Prince Average. Eventually, she hunts down Snow White in the woods, where, disguising herself as the young Merlin, she takes Snow White back to the castle and turns her into a magic tree with a magic apple. However, the real Merlin comes to the rescue as he kills the Queen with his magic and restores both the princess and her father to their human forms. The antagonist of the 2021 sequel mobile game &quot;Red Shoes: Wood Bear World&quot; is Regina&#x27;s sister and also a beautiful but evil witch.

===Long-form literature===
The Evil Queen&#x27;s character has been given various names and characterizations by modern authors. In Adèle Geras&#x27; &quot;Snow White&quot; retelling &quot;Pictures of the Night&quot; (1992), for instance, the protagonist is plagued by a series of mysterious accidents that she believes are being caused by her jealous, malevolent stepmother Marjorie. In Laurence Anholt&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Snow White and the Seven Aliens&quot; (1998), the jealous Mean Queen is a former famous pop star who was the lead singer of The Wonderful Wicked Witches. In Tanith Lee&#x27;s and Terri Windling&#x27;s &quot;White as Snow&quot; (2000), mixing &quot;Snow White&quot; with the tragic myth of Demeter and Persephone, the Queen&#x27;s name is Arpazia. In &quot;Black as Night&quot; (2004), Regina Doman&#x27;s adolescent novel set in modern New York City, Elaine is an egocentric stepmother to Bear (the prince figure) rather than Blanche (Snow White). In &quot;My Fair Godmother&quot; (2009), a romantic comedy novel by Janette Rallison, the evil queen is named Queen Neferia. In Jane Yolen&#x27;s &quot;Snow in Summer: Fairest of Them All&quot; (2011), the Queen is a dark magic-using stepmother simply called Stepmama. In Louise Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Robots: A Graphic Novel&quot; (2015), the Queen exiles the child genius scientist Snow White &quot;so she cannot grow up and take the Queen&#x27;s place as the most intelligent person on the planet.&quot; 

In the DC Universe, the Queen of Fables was a scheming, villainous witch who, in her youth, wrought hell on earth until she was trapped in a book by her own stepdaughter, Snow White. Centuries later, she was freed accidentally by Snow White&#x27;s descendants and has since faced many Justice League superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman, who the Queen thought was Snow White due to her great beauty.

In the long-running Italian erotic comic series &quot;Biancaneve&quot; (1972–1986), the beautiful but evil witch Queen Naga (later just Naga) is the recurring main antagonist, loosely inspired by the Disney character. She is initially married to Kurt, the king of Kurtlandia and Snow White&#x27;s father. Eventually, Naga and Snow White reconcile and even briefly marry (issues 34–35).

In Bill Willingham&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Fables&quot; (2002–2015), the protagonist Snow White&#x27;s and Rose Red&#x27;s witch mother is ordered to kill Snow by the King. She fakes her daughter&#x27;s death and arranges for her to live with her aunt, a widowed queen of a distant land (Snow&#x27;s mother helped her to achieve this position). Years later, her aunt is enraged by the fact that Snow is lovelier than her and decides to kill her herself in a manner similar to the fairy tale (first ordering the hunter and then delivering a poisoned apple).

Gregory Maguire&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; (2003) casts the historical figure Lucrezia Borgia as the wicked stepmother&#x27;s role. Bianca de Nevada (Snow White) is born as a child of a minor noble Vicente de Nevada in the 15th-century Renaissance Italy. After her father is forced to embark on a quest for a magical apple tree by Cesare Borgia, Bianca is left in the care of the beautiful and madly vain Lucrezia who becomes jealous of her lecherous brother Cesare Borgia&#x27;s interest in the growing child. The seven dwarves are the creators of the quicksilver mirror, which makes Lucrezia increasingly paranoid and insane.

In Mette Ivie Harrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Mira, Mirror&quot; (2004), the titular Mirra was a young apprentice witch who was enchanted by her older sister and a fellow apprentice Amanda into a magic mirror so Amanda could transform herself into the most beautiful woman in the world. Amanda becomes a Queen, but later mysteriously disappears, while the story of Mirra continues.

In Gail Carson Levine&#x27;s novel &quot;Fairest&quot; (2006), Queen Ivi is an insecure 19-year-old new queen of Ayortha, who is assisted by Skulni, the mysterious, evil creature living in Ivi&#x27;s magic mirror. The cold-hearted and power-hungry Ivi blackmails the 15-year-old protagonist Aza into becoming her singing voice in order to preserve her own reputation, and later plots Aza&#x27;s death. However, it turns out that Ivi&#x27;s actions were manipulated by Skulni so that he can take a vacation when Ivi is killed. In the end, Ivi turns away from her evil ways, loses her magically created beauty, and is sent away to a remote castle.

Kazuki Nakashima manga series &quot;Lost Seven&quot; (2008) features Queen Rose, also known as The Witch of the Mirror, as a former court magician who usurped the throne and killed all members of the royal family except for Snow White, who managed to escape. She also appears to plan to open a portal to the demon realm through a magic mirror, here called Sephiroth Glass and crafted by Snow White&#x27;s own family. Queen Rose is killed (as is Snow White), but as the castle crumbles she manages to rescue her own biological daughter, Red Rose, who 10 years later becomes the heroine of the series.

In Jim C. Hines&#x27;s &quot;Princesses&quot; series (2009–2011) chronicling the adventures of Snow White, Princess Danielle Whiteshore (Cinderella) and former Princess Talia Malak-el-Dahshat (Sleeping Beauty), Snow White&#x27;s mother, Queen Rose Curtana of Alessandria, was a powerful witch who trained her daughter in magic to later attempt transferring her soul into her daughter&#x27;s body, but thwarted when Snow White proved to be more capable than she had revealed. Snow was banished from her kingdom for the crime of killing her mother (whose feet were burned by the dwarves, here elemental spirits that Snow can summon for aid at the cost of losing seven years of her life as &#x27;payment&#x27; for their services, before they killed her). Rose is returned to life when she is summoned by Danielle&#x27;s stepsisters (believing her to be their now-deceased mother), possessing the elder sister Stacia to acquire a new body, but she is finally defeated when the three princesses confront her with the aid of the seven dwarves. The fourth novel, &quot;The Snow Queen&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (2011), reveals that her magic mirror was created by her imprisoning a demon and binding it to her service, suggesting that the mirror&#x27;s role in the original story was motivated by the demon attempting to create a set of circumstances that would allow it to escape, with the protagonists returning to Rose&#x27;s former castle to rediscover the secrets she used to bind the demon in hopes of exorcising it after it possesses Snow White.

In Tom Holt&#x27;s parody &quot;Snow White and the Seven Samurai&quot; (2010), the wicked queen&#x27;s magic mirror is run by an operating system, which, when hacked, crashes so disastrously that not only the queen&#x27;s plot against Snow White is foiled but all sorts of stories get tangled. In the main storyline, Snow White becomes vicious and hires the titular seven samurai to murder the queen, who is protected by the dwarfs and some other characters and is trying to restore the system.

P. W. Catanese&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mirror&#x27;s Tale (Further Tales Adventures)&quot; (2010) is a sequel to the fairy tale, taking place in the former castle of Rohesia. Before she went mad and became known as the Witch-Queen, Rohesia had been using her magic for healing. Her fate is unclear and mysterious, but her ghost shows up to heal a poisoned character.

In the children&#x27;s book trilogy &quot;Half Upon a Time&quot; by James Riley (2010–2013), the characters set out to rescue May&#x27;s grandmother, who they believe is Snow White. She is eventually revealed as the Wicked Queen and the true antagonist of the series.

In &quot;The Wishing Spell&quot; (2012), a children&#x27;s novel in &quot;The Land of Stories&quot; series by Chris Colfer, the Evil Queen has been spared by Snow White. She escapes her imprisonment, recovers her magic mirror and reunites with the Huntsman at a remote castle. The Queen desires to complete the Wishing Spell and seeks and sends her new Huntress (the Hunter&#x27;s daughter) to collect the ingredients for it. She captures the protagonists Conner and Alex, and reveals to them her tragic story. Her real name was Evly, and she was once in love with, and engaged to, a man named Mira. When Evly refused to comply with the wishes of an evil enchantress, he was cursed to be trapped inside a mirror. Evly sought her revenge by killing the enchantress, but there was no way for her to break the curse. A witch named Hagatha cured Evly&#x27;s heartbreak by cutting out her heart and turning it to a stone heart and so Evly could only feel emotion when she was holding it. Evly then snaked her way up to the throne, killing Snow White&#x27;s mother and marrying the King. Mira&#x27;s condition began to deteriorate until he became a bland reflection, and he became enamored with Snow White rather than the Queen, and it was what so enraged her and made her order the Huntsman to kill Snow White. Using the Wishing Spell, the Queen manages to free Mira, but he is no longer capable of living outside the mirror and dies in her arms, and they both are consumed by the mirror that once held Mira captive, which then shatters. It is later revealed that Snow White herself has let her escape the dungeon, knowing the Queen&#x27;s story. In the sequel, &quot;The Enchantress Returns&quot; (2015), Conner and Alex manage to restore the mirror and contact Evly, but find out that she has become insane and the mirror&#x27;s curse is in process of taking over her soul completely, just as it did with Mira.

In Marissa Meyer&#x27;s &quot;The Lunar Chronicles&quot; (2012–2015), Queen Levana is the main antagonist and the equivalent of the Evil Queen. She is the ruler of the moon, aunt of the protagonist Cinder, and stepmother of Princess Winter. Severely scarred from childhood burns, she either wears a veil or uses her psychic abilities to glamour herself with extreme beauty. &quot;Fairest&quot;, a prequel novella, focuses on her backstory.

Helen Oyeyemi&#x27;s novel &quot;Boy, Snow, Bird&quot; (2014) is a rendition of &quot;Snow White&quot; set in 1950s New England. Oyeyemi said she wrote a wicked stepmother story because she &quot;wanted to rescue the wicked queen from Snow White, because she seemed to find being a villain a bit of a hassle in a lot of ways. She wasn’t very efficient – it took her three tries to kill Snow White, for example. And I had read Barbara Comyns&#x27; &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot;, which is a retelling of the fairy tale from the perspective of the wicked stepmother, as well, so I began to see a way that I could do it for myself.&quot;

&quot;Dark Shimmer&quot; by Donna Jo Napoli (2015) reimagines &quot;Snow White&quot; in medieval Italy, focused on the backstory of the Evil Queen figure. Dolce is an innocent, kind woman who grew up thinking she was hideous. Her mood swings and attempts to murder her beloved stepdaughter are the result of mercury poisoning from making mirrors.

Gena Showalter&#x27;s &quot;The Evil Queen&quot; (2019), features Everly Morrow, a high school girl obsessed with mirrors who learns that she is prophesied to become the eponymous character in another world of the fairytale realm of Enchantia and tries to avert her destiny.

In Rebecca Willoughby&#x27;s &quot;The Evil Queen&quot; (2024), the sorceress Rowena has seized the throne after orchestrating the death of her husband, the King. Despite her malevolence, Rowena&#x27;s sorcery prevents the kingdom from succumbing to a mysterious phenomenon known as &quot;the flood.&quot; Snow White remains unaware that her rightful claim to the throne is a threat to Rowena&#x27;s rule.

===Short-form literature===
The Queen has been featured in many short stories. In the &quot;Snow White&quot; chapter of Merseyside Fairy Story Collective&#x27;s (edited by Jack Zipes) &quot;Don&#x27;t Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and England&quot; (1986), the evil queen is ousted by popular revolution. Another short story, &quot;The Tale of the Apple&quot; in Emma Donoghue&#x27;s collection &quot;Kissing the Witch: Old Tales in New Skins&quot; (1997), is a modern adaptation in which it is the Queen who awakens Snow White from her slumber because she yields to her desire for the princess. Priscilla Galloway&#x27;s collection of short stories &quot;Truly Grim Tales&quot; (1999) includes a version of &quot;Snow White&quot; told from the wicked stepmother&#x27;s point of view. In the erotic short story &quot;Gold, on Snow&quot;, published by Alison Tyler in &quot;Alison&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; (2010), the jealous Queen spies on her stepdaughter in the house of the dwarves.

Robert Coover&#x27;s satirical erotic short story &quot;The Dead Queen&quot; (1973) re-tells the fairy tale from the perspective of the Prince, deeply disappointed with Snow White and her creepy sexual relationship with the dwarves. At the Queen&#x27;s funeral after her fiery execution, as she is buried in Snow White&#x27;s former glass coffin, he suddenly realized that the Queen had loved him and had died for him. In desperation, he attempts bring her back to life by kissing her mutilated corpse, but in vain. James Finn Garner included another satirical take on &quot;Snow White&quot; in his collection &quot;Politically Correct Bedtime Stories&quot; (1994) in which the Queen accidentally bonds with Snow White during the apple scene. Forgetting that the apple in question was poisoned, she shares it with Snow White and both fall comatose to the floor. When the dwarfs discover this, they decide to sell Snow White to the Prince so he can have sex with her. However, when they try to move the two women&#x27;s bodies, they break the spell and the women awaken, angry and disgusted at what they overheard. The Queen then declares that the dwarfs are trespassers, throwing them out of her forest, and she and Snow White later open a spa for women on the same spot.

Carmen Boullosa&#x27;s short story &quot;Blancanieves&quot; (1992) explores the concept of female sexuality, focusing on the relationship between the Queen and the forester (the hunter), and the &#x27;love&#x27; triangle between the two and Blancanieves (Snow White). In it, the sexually aggressive Queen dominates the forester, who, within his narrative, blames his sexual weakness on the magic potion that he was forced to drink. In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;Snow, Glass, Apples&quot; (1994), the Queen is a tragic hero protagonist who struggles desperately to save the kingdom from her secretly vampiric stepdaughter. At the end of the story, it all turns out to be a recollection by the Queen as she is roasted alive inside an enormous kiln on the orders by Snow White and the Prince. Gaiman&#x27;s story resembles 
the titular story from &quot;Red as Blood, or Tales from the Sisters Grimmer&quot; (1983) by Tanith Lee, in which the Witch Queen is trying to stop the real villain, her stepdaughter Bianca, who is actually a vampire.

&quot;Snow Night&quot;, a short story published in Barbara G. Walker&#x27;s &quot;Feminist Fairy Tales&quot; (1996), the King&#x27;s master of the hunt tries to incite jealousy in the Queen towards her stepdaughter after having been rejected by Snow Night. However, the Queen laughs off her magic mirror&#x27;s answer, claiming that people go through cycles and that it is impossible to challenge the will of nature. The story suggests that the traditional version of the tale was actually invented by the exiled and crazed huntsman, now imprisoned in a distant country. In the preface, Walker wrote: &quot;Snow White&#x27;s stepmother seems to have been vilified because (a) she resented being less beautiful than Snow White, and (b) she practiced witchcraft. One might suspect that female beauty was really a larger issue for men than for women, because male sexual response depends to a considerable degree on visual clues. ... A queen who was also a witch would have been a formidable figure, adding political influence to spiritual mana. Snow White&#x27;s stepmother therefore seems to me a projection of male jealousies. As re-envisioned in this story, she may seem more true to life.&quot; &quot;The True Story&quot;, a revisionist short story by Pat Murphy, published in the collection &quot;Black Swan, White Raven&quot; (1998), tells a story of a queen who sent her daughter away to avoid the incestuous advances of her pedophiliac and abusive husband, the King. The princess is cared for by seven witches in the forest, and when the king dies, she is brought back to rule the kingdom in her own right, instead of at the side of a prince.

===Other works===
Marius Petipa and Arseny Koreshchenko&#x27;s 1903 ballet &quot;The Magic Mirror&quot;, melds the Brothers Grimm tale with the Russian variant &quot;The Tale of the Dead Princess and the Seven Knights,&quot; which features no magic elements. After the evil deeds of the envious Queen (originally played by Marius Petipa&#x27;s daughter Marie Petipa) against the Princess are exposed and the King threatens her with imprisonment, she has an attack of insanity, admits what she ordered be done and falls dead.

In Robert Walser&#x27;s 1904 opera &quot;Schneewittchen&quot; (and João César Monteiro&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Branca de Neve&quot;), the adolescent, weak Prince has revived Snow White, but instead of marrying her has fallen in love with the beautiful Queen. The Prince thinks the villain is the huntsman, who is the Queen&#x27;s lover, while the King is oblivious of everything. The story centers on the conflict between the Queen and Snow White, and ends when the latter decides to forgive the former and the two make peace at last.

In the 1912 play &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, written by &quot;Jessie Graham White&quot; (Winthrop Ames), Queen Brangomar is jealous of Prince Florimond&#x27;s love of Snow White. Brangomar summons Witch Hex (Hexy), a powerful godmother. In the end, Snow White forgives the Queen and, despite objections from the hunter (Berthold) who wants Brangomar dead, lets her go away unharmed. In the play&#x27;s 1916 cinematic adaptation, the silent film &quot;Snow White&quot;, Queen Brangomar (played by Dorothy Cumming) and the Witch are two separate characters, and it is the latter who demands to have the heart of Snow White. Having first disguised herself as a hag to give Snow White a poisoned comb, the Queen later actually changes her sex to turn herself into a pieman in the scenario where the apple is replaced by a pie. In the end, Brangomar is punished by being turned into a peacock. (In another cut, she simply vanishes from the film). Elements from these versions of &quot;Snow White&quot; inspired Disney&#x27;s film adaptation.

In Howard Barker&#x27;s play &quot;Knowledge and a Girl (The Snow White Case)&quot; (2002), the Queen is the protagonist, attempting to resist the patriarchal and misogynistic structure of the kingdom&#x27;s court through her lewd sexuality. The Queen is infertile and, at first, the impotent and abusive King actually accepts his wife&#x27;s promiscuity. Snow White envies the Queen&#x27;s sexual experience and tries to outdo her stepmother&#x27;s debauchery. Eventually, however, the King decides to get rid of his Queen. In the final scene, when the Queen appears at the marriage of Snow White and is forced to put on red-hot iron shoes, she is determined to defy them by suffering in silence and motionless.

In Mattel&#x27;s Ever After High franchise, one of the lead character of the franchise is Raven Queen, the daughter of the original Evil Queen, along with Snow White&#x27;s daughter Apple White. Raven is a rebel, frustrated with her destiny to become a new queen of evil, and wishes to go her own way. Most people see her as evil and mean, but she is actually misunderstood: she wishes to be herself and strives to rewrite her own chapter, thereby proving that evilness is not hereditary. The Evil Queen herself is locked up in Mirror Prison and often insults the things Raven talks about, including Raven&#x27;s father, the Good King.

In the lore of the video game series &quot;Dark Parables&quot;, the jealous Queen enchants the King to put the twins Snow White and Ross Red to death for a false offense. She is eventually exposed by a magic frog that Snow White had befriended sometime before and who turned out to be The Cursed Prince, and flees the kingdom. Ellen Reid&#x27;s 2001 debut album &quot;Cinderellen&quot; features the song &quot;In Defense of the Wicked Queen&quot;, which tells the story from the Queen&#x27;s perspective.

<text>Star Search (later known as Ed McMahon&#x27;s Star Search) is an American television show that was produced by T.P.E./Rysher Entertainment from 1983 to 1995, hosted by Ed McMahon, and created by Al Masini. A relaunch was produced by 2929 Productions from 2003 to 2004. On both versions of the show, contestants competed in several genres of entertainment. The show was originally filmed at the Earl Carroll Theatre at 6230 Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood; it was later filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios in Orlando, Florida.

==1983–1995 version==
While categories varied slightly from season to season, the ten basic categories during the 1983–1995 version were:

* Female singer
* Male singer
* Junior singer (Second half of the season)
* Teen singer (First half of the season)
* Group vocal
* Dance
* Junior dance (First half of the season)
* Teen dance (Second half of the season)
* Spokesmodel
* Comedy

Eight categories were contested per show. Potential contestants auditioned to be on the show. In each category, two selected contestants would compete, a champion and a challenger. The challenger would usually perform first, while the champion performed second. In later seasons, the champion performed first.

All acts were judged by a panel of four judges, and each judge could award an act from one to four stars (later changed to five stars). Once both acts were complete, Ed would reveal the scores, and the best average won. If there was a tie, a studio audience vote broke the tie, in which case the results were revealed at the end of the show.

Any performer must win at least several shows in a row, depending on the number of shows left in the season, to earn an entry into the next round of the competition; usually this was three or four wins in a row. In later seasons, three-match winners were automatically retired. In this case, two new performers would compete in that category the following week.

In most seasons, two semifinal shows took place, one in the fall, the other in the spring, prior to the championship show. Each semifinal used seven judges. No scoring was used, and the judges&#x27; votes weren&#x27;t revealed, but the acts that won their semifinals would then compete in the championship show.

On the championship show, winners of Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, Vocal Group, Comedy, and Dance, were awarded $100,000 but no record contract was guaranteed. Many Star Search winners from the early seasons secured recording contracts within a few weeks of the end of the competition—first season vocal group winner Sawyer Brown, first season male vocalist champion Sam Harris and second season male vocalist champion Durell Coleman were the first three, and were later followed by second season vocal group winner Limited Warranty, third season female vocalist champion Linda Eder, second season junior male vocalist champion Jimmy Salvemini, whose album was produced by Luther Vandross, fourth season male vocalist champion David Slater, and third season junior female vocalist runner-up Tiffany. Despite not winning her competition (she lost to Melissa Moultrie), Tiffany, performing as &#x27;Tiffany Renee,&#x27; was the first &quot;Star Search&quot; alumna to land a #1 hit, with her cover of the Top 5 Tommy James and the Shondells hit &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; —actually improving on the original single&#x27;s chart performance. The winner of the Spokesmodel category was awarded $100,000 and a contract with a well-known modeling agency. The first Spokesmodel winner was Tracey Ross, who later became a leading actress on the soap opera &quot;Passions&quot;. Winners of Junior Vocalist, Junior Dance, Teen Vocalist, and Teen Dance win $10,000.

In early seasons, before the three match limit rule was adopted, the grand champions were determined by how long a champion held their title. While it is believed that Sam Harris holds the record for longest championship, at 14 weeks in Season 1, Harris was actually defeated by singer Beau Williams on Harris&#x27; 14th attempt. This record is actually held by singer Durell Coleman (1985), who won the $100,000 on Season 2 with 15 wins and no defeats.

In the 1992–93 season, a daily version of the show aired but was cancelled midseason.

In the 1993–1994 season, the title was changed to &quot;Ed McMahon&#x27;s Star Search.&quot;

Former MTV veejay Martha Quinn joined the series as co-host for the 1994–95 season, judging the musical groups competition.

&quot;Star Search&quot; was typically syndicated on Fox Television Stations (before October 1986, Metromedia, Inc.), stations owned by the Gaylord Broadcasting Co., stations owned by Taft Broadcasting, and stations owned by Cox Communications.

==2003–2004 version==

In the wake of &quot;American Idol&quot;s success, Arsenio Hall hosted a new version of &quot;Star Search&quot;, which ran from 2003 to 2004 on CBS. It would be rerun on GSN from 2004 to 2005. This new version was judged by four panelists, including Ben Stein, Naomi Judd, Ahmet Zappa and a rotating celebrity panelist (which in at least one case was McMahon himself). Among the winners were singer Tiffany Evans, comedian John Roy and singer Mark Mejia.

The revival consisted of four seasons. For the first season, the categories were Adult and Junior Singer, Comedy, and Modeling. In seasons two and three, Modeling was replaced with Dance. In the final season, the Comedy category was scrapped altogether and only the singing and dancing categories remained.

For the first three seasons, two new competitors faced off. The three house judges, along with the one celebrity judge, gave each contestant a score on a scale from one to five stars, making a maximum studio score 20 stars. During each commercial break, the home audience went to www.cbs.com/star to rate the competitors who just performed. Each performer could earn up to another 20 stars from the home audience. In the climactic moment before the score from the home audience was revealed, Hall would often say, &quot;Hit me with the digits!&quot;

When the scores were tallied, the higher scoring performer won. If the score was tied, then Hall would read off each performer&#x27;s score rounded to the nearest hundredth (the at-home score was initially rounded down to the nearest star, unless there was a tie). That performer would then go on to the next round of competition. The only real exception to this format during the first three seasons was that three people competed in the semi-final rounds, not two. After the first three seasons, a special, &quot;Battle of the Best&quot; show took place, where the three Adult Singer, Junior Singer, Comedian, and two Young Dancer Grand Champions (Modeling was only the first season, and Dance had only been around for two seasons) were brought back to face off for an additional $100,000.

For the fourth and final season, three contestants in Adult Singer, Junior Singer, and Dance were brought back to initially compete (Comedy was dropped, jokingly because Naomi gave many comics only one star). The three brought back in each category were not necessarily the Grand Champions of their season. The show scrapped the celebrity judge and had three house judges for the entire series: Naomi Judd, MC Lyte, and Matti Leshem (who tried to berate contestants as Simon Cowell was doing at the time on &quot;American Idol&quot;).

As in past seasons, two new contestants competed. With only three judges, a score of 15 stars was possible, and ties were broken by a majority vote between the three. This is where the former contestants came in. Initially, in each category, these three performers made up the &quot;Winner&#x27;s Circle&quot;. The winning challenger then had the chance to challenge one of the three performers in his or her respective winner&#x27;s circle. The winner&#x27;s circle performer then had to beat or tie the bar set by the challenger; ties were automatically given to the Winner&#x27;s Circle performer. If they couldn&#x27;t beat the score, they were out of the competition, and the challenger took his or her place in the Winner&#x27;s Circle.

Halfway through the program, the three performers in each Winner&#x27;s Circle competed against each other in a special show. The winner in each category not only received a trip home, but a free pass to the final show. From then on, there were only two people who could be challenged in each Winner&#x27;s Circle. In the final show, the three people in each Winner&#x27;s Circle competed against each other for $100,000. This, along with the Free Pass show, were the only two shows which re-adopted the at-home voting concept.

* The Adult Singer group was the only group to record a complete shutout. The three performers in the beginning were there in the end as well.
* The free pass was equally important in the other two groups as well. In both the Dance and Junior Singer categories, not only did the free pass save the winner from being challenged in an ever-changing Winner&#x27;s Circle, but they ended up winning their group finals (Junior Singer Mark Mejia and Dancer Jon Cruz).
* Adult Singer and season 1 champion Jake Simpson was challenged a record four times during his tenure in the Winner&#x27;s Circle. He not only went a perfect 4–0, but he also won his group final. The only match he lost that entire season was the Winner&#x27;s Circle Square-Off Special.

At the same time, a spin-off called &quot;Star Search – Das Duell der Stars von Morgen&quot; was produced and aired in Germany, but with less success than the more popular show &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot;, the German version of the &quot;Idol&quot; franchise.

<text>Ximing Temple () was a famous temple in Chang&#x27;an (now known as Xi&#x27;an), the capital of the Tang dynasty. Chang&#x27;an was the eastern terminus of the Silk Road, and a cosmopolitan metropolis. Ximing was established by Tang Gaozong in 656. The temple is named after a Korean Buddhist monk known as Ximing Fashi (). Also known as Woncheuk (613–696) (Chinese Yuáncè), he did most of his important scholarly work at this temple.

It was at Ximing that pilgrim and traveller Xuanzang (602-664) translated the scriptures he had brought back from India. Another traveller Yijing (635-713) also based himself at Ximing while working on translations of Indian scriptures. , an Indian scholar monk, was responsible for the introduction of the Mahavairocana Sutra and the tantric traditions associated with it. Kukai, a Japanese monk, studied Sanskrit there under the tutelage of Gandharan pandit Prajñā (734-810?) who had been educated at the Indian Buddhist university at Nalanda. Ximing was celebrated for its library which was the most comprehensive library of Buddhist texts in China at the time.

<doc id="570580" wikidata="Q27887610" url="?curid=570580" title="Diethyl malonate">
<text>Diethyl malonate, also known as DEM, is the diethyl ester of malonic acid. It occurs naturally in grapes and strawberries as a colourless liquid with an apple-like odour, and is used in perfumes. It is also used to synthesize other compounds such as barbiturates, artificial flavourings, vitamin B1, and vitamin B6.

==Structure and properties==
Malonic acid is a rather simple dicarboxylic acid, with two carboxyl groups close together. In forming diethyl malonate from malonic acid, the hydroxyl group (−OH) on both of the carboxyl groups is replaced by an ethoxy group (−OEt; −OCH2CH3). The methylene group (−CH2−) in the middle of the malonic part of the diethyl malonate molecule is neighboured by two carbonyl groups (−C(=O)−).

The hydrogen atoms on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group in a molecule are significantly more acidic than hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to alkyl groups (up to 30 orders of magnitude). (This is known as the α position with respect to the carbonyl.) The hydrogen atoms on a carbon adjacent to two carbonyl groups are even more acidic because the carbonyl groups help stabilize the carbanion resulting from the removal of a proton from the methylene group between them. The extent of resonance stabilization of this compound&#x27;s conjugate base is suggested by the three resonance forms below:

==Preparation==
Diethyl malonate is produced from the reaction of the sodium salt of chloroacetic acid with sodium cyanide, which produces the nitrile. This intermediate is then treated with ethanol in the presence of acid catalyst:
:

Alternatively, sodium chloroacetate undergoes carboxyesterification by treatment with carbon monoxide and ethanol:
Dicobalt octacarbonyl is employed as the catalyst.

==Reactions==
===Malonic ester synthesis===

One of the principal uses of this compound is in the malonic ester synthesis. The carbanion (2) formed by reacting diethyl malonate (1) with a suitable base can be alkylated with a suitable electrophile. This alkylated 1,3-dicarbonyl compound (3) readily undergoes decarboxylation with loss of carbon dioxide, to give a substituted acetic acid (4):

In general, salts of the alkoxide anion whose alkyl part corresponds to the one used in the above alkylation are preferred as the base. The use of a conventional base may give base hydrolysis products – for example, sodium hydroxide would simply produce sodium malonate and the alcohol, while other alkoxide salts will cause scrambling by transesterification. Only the &quot;same&quot; alkoxide anion as the one that one used to alkylate the deprotonated active methylenic site will prevent both base hydrolysis and transesterification.

===Other reactions===
Like many other esters, this compound undergoes the Claisen ester condensations. The advantage of using this compound is that unwanted self-condensation reactions are avoided. Like other esters, this compound undergoes bromination at the alpha position.

Diethyl malonate can be nitrosated with excess sodium nitrite in acetic acid to afford diethyl oximinomalonate, catalytic hydrogenolysis of which in ethanol over Pd/C affords diethyl aminomalonate (DEAM). DEAM can be acetylated to produce diethyl acetamidomalonate (useful in amino-acid synthesis), or can be added with 3-substituted 2,4-diketones to boiling acetic acid to afford in maximal yield variously substituted ethyl pyrrole-2-carboxylates of interest for porphyrin synthesis.
==Applications==

Diethyl malonate is used in the preparation of several medicinally useful compounds including vigabatrin, phenylbutazone, nalidixic acid, and rebamipide. Several pesticides are also produced from diethylmalonate, including sethoxydim and the derivatives of 2-amino-4-chloro-6-methoxypyrimidine.

<text>Max Wilhelm Dehn (November 13, 1878 – June 27, 1952) was a German mathematician most famous for his work in geometry, topology and geometric group theory. Dehn&#x27;s early life and career took place in Germany. However, he was forced to retire in 1935 and eventually fled Germany in 1939 and emigrated to the United States.

Dehn was a student of David Hilbert, and in his habilitation in 1900 Dehn resolved Hilbert&#x27;s third problem, making him the first to resolve one of Hilbert&#x27;s well-known 23 problems. Dehn&#x27;s doctoral students include Ott-Heinrich Keller, Ruth Moufang, and Wilhelm Magnus; he also mentored mathematician Peter Nemenyi and the artists Dorothea Rockburne and Ruth Asawa.

==Biography==
Dehn was born to a family of Jewish origin in Hamburg, Imperial Germany.

He studied the foundations of geometry with Hilbert at Göttingen in 1899, and obtained a proof of the Jordan curve theorem for polygons. In 1900 he wrote his dissertation on the role of the Legendre angle sum theorem in axiomatic geometry, constructing the Dehn planes as counterexamples to the theorem in geometries without the Archimedean axiom. From 1900 to 1911 he was an employee and researcher at the University of Münster. In his habilitation at the University of Münster in 1900 he resolved Hilbert&#x27;s third problem, by introducing what was afterwards called the Dehn invariant. This was the first resolution of one of the Hilbert Problems.

Dehn&#x27;s interests later turned to topology and combinatorial group theory. In 1907 he wrote with Poul Heegaard the first book on the foundations of combinatorial topology, then known as &quot;analysis situs&quot;. Also in 1907, he described the construction of a new homology sphere. In 1908 he believed that he had found a proof of the Poincaré conjecture, but Tietze found an error.

In 1910 Dehn published a paper on three-dimensional topology in which he introduced Dehn surgery and used it to construct homology spheres. He also stated Dehn&#x27;s lemma, but an error was found in his proof by Hellmuth Kneser in 1929. The result was proved in 1957 by Christos Papakyriakopoulos. The word problem for groups, also called the Dehn problem, was posed by him in 1911.

Dehn married Antonie Landau on August 23, 1912. Also in 1912, Dehn invented what is now known as Dehn&#x27;s algorithm and used it in his work on the word and conjugacy problems for groups. The notion of a Dehn function in geometric group theory, which estimates the area of a relation in a finitely presented group in terms of the length of that relation, is also named after him. In 1914 he proved that the left and right trefoil knots are not equivalent. In the early 1920s Dehn introduced the result that would come to be known as the Dehn-Nielsen theorem; its proof would be published in 1927 by Jakob Nielsen.

In 1922 Dehn succeeded Ludwig Bieberbach at Frankfurt, where he stayed until he was forced to retire in 1935. During this time he taught a seminar on historical works of mathematics. The seminar attracted prolific mathematicians Carl Ludwig Siegel and André Weil, and Weil considered Dehn&#x27;s seminar to be his most important contribution to mathematics. As an example of its influence, the seminar has been credited for inspiring Siegel&#x27;s discovery of the Riemann–Siegel formula among Riemann&#x27;s unpublished notes.

Dehn stayed in Germany until January 1939, when he fled to Copenhagen, and then to Trondheim, Norway, where he took a position at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. In October 1940 he left Norway for America by way of Siberia and Japan (the Atlantic crossing was considered too dangerous).

In America, Dehn obtained a position at Idaho Southern University (now Idaho State University). In 1942 he took a job at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and in 1943 he moved to St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland. Finally in 1945, he moved to the experimental arts college, Black Mountain College, where he was the only mathematician.

He died in Black Mountain, North Carolina in 1952.

==Black Mountain College==
In March 1944, Dehn was invited to give two talks at Black Mountain College on the philosophy and history of mathematics. He noted in a letter that a lecture on an advanced mathematical topic didn&#x27;t seem appropriate given the audience. He instead offered up the lectures &quot;Common roots of mathematics and ornamentics,&quot; and &quot;Some moments in the development of mathematical ideas.&quot; Black Mountain College faculty contacted him shortly after concerning a full-time position. After negotiating his salary from $25 to $40 per month, Dehn and his wife moved into housing provided by the school and he began teaching in January 1945.

While at Black Mountain College, Dehn taught courses in Mathematics, Philosophy, Greek, and Italian. In his class &quot;Geometry for Artists,&quot; Dehn introduced students to geometric concepts such as points, lines, planes and solids; cones sectioned into circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas; spheres and regular polyhedrons. His classes had an emphasis on the way shapes relate to each other, a concept that can be useful in artistic mediums.

He enjoyed the forested mountains found in Black Mountain, and would often hold class in the woods, giving lectures during hikes. His lectures frequently drifted off topic on tangents about philosophy, the arts, and nature and their connection to mathematics. He and his wife took part in community meetings and often ate in the dining room. They also regularly had long breakfasts with Buckminster Fuller and his wife.

In the summer of 1952 Dehn was made Professor Emeritus, which allowed him to remain on campus and act as an advisor. Unfortunately he died of an embolism shortly after witnessing the removal of several dogwood trees from the campus. He is buried in the woods on the campus.

<text>The Mitsubishi Eclipse is a sport compact car that was produced by Mitsubishi in four generations from 1989 until 2011. A convertible body style was added during the 1996 model year.

The first two generations share the automobile platform and parts with the rebadged Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser captive imports. They were built during Mitsubishi Motors&#x27; close relationship with Chrysler Corporation. Their partnership was known as Diamond-Star Motors (DSM). In Japan, the first two generations were sold at a specific Japanese retail chain called &quot;Mitsubishi Car Plaza&quot;. The third, 2000–2005 generation shared a redesigned platform with the Chrysler Sebring and Dodge Stratus. In May 2005, the fourth, and final generation Eclipse was introduced, replacing the Chrysler platform used for the third generation with the PS platform.

According to Mitsubishi Motors, the Eclipse was named after an unbeaten 18th-century English racehorse that won 18 races in a row and then retired.

At the end of August 2011, the final Eclipse was manufactured and subsequently auctioned for charity.

In 2017, Mitsubishi resurrected the Eclipse name on a compact crossover vehicle, called the Eclipse Cross.

== First generation (D21A/D22A/D27A; 1989) ==
===Overview===
The first-generation Mitsubishi Eclipse was marketed as an entry to the mid-level four-cylinder sports coupe segment. It was developed for the North American market, where sales began in the autumn of 1989. Japanese sales of cars imported from Illinois began in 1990, and in late 1991 limited European sales began. At first, the car was only sold in Austria, Sweden, and Switzerland, but other countries were gradually added. Five trim levels were available; all were front-wheel drive except the GSX which was all-wheel drive. The GS Turbo and GSX were equipped with turbocharged engines.

The profile was low and sleek; the hood line was so low that it needed a bump to clear the engine&#x27;s cam cover. The first-generation Eclipse underwent minor styling changes during its production; the car received updated, more ovoid sheet metal for 1992. The most notable is that the pre-facelift models have pop-up headlights, whereas 1992 through 1994 models have exposed aerodynamic headlights. The original Eclipse was replaced by the second generation model for the 1995 model year.

===Trim levels===
The Eclipse was available in five trim levels during its first-generation production run. AWD models were not available until halfway through the first model year.

*Eclipse: Base model equipped with a naturally-aspirated 1.8 L 8-valve SOHC 4G37 I4 engine
*Eclipse GS: Upgraded model with more equipment
*Eclipse GS DOHC: Upgraded model equipped with a naturally aspirated 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC Mitsubishi Sirius engine; a naturally aspirated variant of the 4G63T I4 engine
*Eclipse GS DOHC AWD: Equipped with a 4G63 16-valve naturally-aspirated engine (AWD N/A only available in Europe) All were only available with a five-speed manual transmission and without rear limited-slip differential. sunroof, cruise control, anti-lock brakes, central locking, and air conditioning were included.
*Eclipse GS Turbo: Upgraded model equipped with a * turbocharged 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC 4G63T I4 engine
*Eclipse GSX: AWD model equipped with a * turbocharged 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC 4G63T I4 engine

 &quot;The 1990 GS Turbo with a manual transmission was rated at 190 hp, whereas the 1990 GSX with a manual transmission was rated at . This was for the purpose of offsetting the additional weight of the AWD mechanism (approximately 2,930 lbs Vs 2,570 lbs GVW). However, 1991 and later years of both turbo models standardized on the 195 hp version 4G63T. The automatic models were rated at due to smaller fuel-injectors and turbocharger.&quot;

These models varied significantly in drivetrains and available options, and included some variance in appearance, as higher trim lines added different front and rear fascia panels and surrounding trim, with the GSX model getting a notably different styling package from the others. In the European market, only a single trim was available (sold either as plain &quot;Eclipse&quot;, or with GS or GSi badging depending on the importer), fitted with the 2-liter DOHC engine producing . Some European buyers could also opt for four-wheel-drive.

===Powertrain===
The basic driveline layout of the Eclipse is a transverse-mounted I4 Mitsubishi 4G37 or 4G63 engine situated on the left-hand side of the car driving an automatic or manual transmission on the right-hand side. AWD models have a different transmission which includes a limited-slip center differential and output shaft for a transfer case, which drives the rear differential (also available as limited-slip) and half-shafts.

====Engines====
The 4G37 and 4G63 engines are gasoline inline-fours. The 4G63 has an iron engine block with an aluminum cylinder head and is equipped with two balance shafts. The turbocharged version of the 4G63 (sometimes referred to as the 4G63T) has a lower compression ratio of 7.8:1 and oil squirters under the pistons for better cooling from extra heat created by forced induction. The turbocharged 4G63 engine received an internal update during the 1992 model year. The engines built from 1989 through April 1992 have 6-bolt motors. Beginning in May 1992, Mitsubishi revised the engine to a 7-bolt design.

===Problems and issues===
In March 1998, Mitsubishi issued a recall (bulletin 98V069001) for all 1990–1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing, &quot;Lockup of the transfer case can occur due to insufficient lubrication. The condition can cause a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk of a crash.&quot; The dealers would inspect the vehicles for the adequacy of the transfer case oil volume, transfer case oil leakage, and operational degradation of the transfer case mechanism. The transfer case itself did not leak but rather the brass plug in the center of the transfer case yoke would leak. Mitsubishi estimated that 24,275 vehicles were affected.

== Second generation (D31A/D32A/D33A/D38A/D39A; 1994) ==
===Overview===
The Eclipse was redesigned in 1994 (for the 1995 model year) and included standard dual airbags, more rounded styling, a larger interior, and a new engine made by Chrysler for the base model. The second-generation car maintained the market focus of the first-generation car but had numerous changes to appeal to a broader market. A convertible model, named the Eclipse Spyder, was introduced in 1996 and offered in two trim levels; the GS and the GS-T. The Spyder GS was powered by a 2.4 L I4 naturally-aspirated 4G64 engine. The Spyder GS-T was fitted with Mitsubishi&#x27;s 2.0 L turbocharged 4G63 I4 engine. The GSX model was also powered by this engine but with the addition of all-wheel drive system. No convertible model was powered by the Chrysler&#x27;s 420a engine, nor was there a convertible with all-wheel-drive.

The turbocharged engine option was updated for more power as compared to the previous generation ( vs. ). The naturally-aspirated cars had two different I4 engines depending on the market. The US version engines produced 140 hp, found only in the RS and GS trims, and were a modified version of the Chrysler Neon engine, the 420A, manufactured by Chrysler and delivered to and installed at the Diamond Star Motors facility. The European market engines were a naturally aspirated 4G63 with . International market Eclipses made less horsepower than their Japanese domestic market equivalents when equipped with the 4G63 (, ), due to emissions regulations.

This model exceeded Japanese government&#x27;s compact car regulations regarding exterior dimensions (maximum width of ), therefore incurred a more expensive annual road tax obligation.

A special version of the Eclipse, called the &quot;10th Anniversary OZ Rally&quot;, was sold at the end of the 1999 model run with unique 16-inch Enkei wheels with the OZ Racing logo. It also included the leather interior package, accented exhaust exit, “silver” gauges, mud flaps, and higher-profile spoiler that were available as standard equipment on GS-T coupe and GSX models. The special-edition package was only offered with the 420A engine.

A unique version of the 2G Eclipse was sold in some European countries. It used a naturally-aspirated Mitsubishi 4G63 motor, similar to what was available in the 1G, unique side-view mirrors, and amber rear turn signals.

A minor style revision was applied for the 1997 model year. The front grille opening was given a more aggressive profile. The headlights were given a sharper slant on the inner edges, and the previous all-chrome fixture interior changed to a black interior with chrome reflector inserts. The driving lights were revised from a reflector type to a smaller projection type. The rear bumper cap was altered and had the reverse lights restyled and moved out into the bumper fascia, away from their original central position by the rear license plate bracket. The GS-T coupe and GSX received a higher-profile rear spoiler. The interior color choices also changed from blue and grey in 1995–1996 model years to black/grey, tan/black, and grey in the 1997–1999 model years. A black leather interior option was only available in 1999; the package included all seats (with the &#x27;Mitsubishi&#x27; logo embroidered on both of the fronts), door inserts, and a center console armrest.
===Trim levels===
The Eclipse was available in seven trim levels: Base [Only available in 1996.5 (mid-model year)], RS (Rally Sport), GS (Grand Sport), GS Spyder, GS-T (Grand Sport Turbo), GS-T Spyder, and GSX (Grand Sport X=AWD).

*Eclipse RS: Base model equipped with a and of torque 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC Chrysler 420a I4 engine
*Eclipse GS: Equipment upgraded model equipped with a and of torque 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC Chrysler 420A engine. The European variant of the GS had a naturally-aspirated, DOHC 16-valve 4G63 I4 engine producing 150 HP
*Eclipse Spyder GS: Convertible model equipped with a 2.4 L 16-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 4G64 I4 engine

*Eclipse GSX: AWD model equipped with a and of torque turbocharged and intercooled 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC Mitsubishi 4G63 I4 engine

===Standard equipment===
The second-generation Eclipse was offered in various trim levels. Standard equipment would slightly throughout the production run as some items that were optional on certain trims became standard later in the production run. Each trim level came with a standard list of equipment; however, optional equipment packages were also available to add popular and premium features, most commonly found on the GS model. In addition, optional equipment was also available such as a trunk-mounted CD player, leather interior on the GS and GS-T and HomeLink and other items such as floormats and wheel locks.

*RS: 2.0 L DOHC I4 engine, five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, driver and passenger airbags, power steering, cloth reclining front bucket seats, five-way adjustable driver&#x27;s seat with memory recliner, center storage console, folding rear seat, map lights, remote fuel door and rear hatch releases, tachometer, trip odometer, low fluid warning lights, AM/FM radio, digital clock, tinted glass, rear defogger, dual remote mirrors, color-keyed bumpers and front air dam, 14-inch wheels with full wheel covers (195/70/HR14 tires.)

===Powertrain===
The basic driveline layout of the Eclipse is a transverse-mounted I4 Chrysler 420A, Mitsubishi 4G64, or 4G63 engine. The Mitsubishi engines are mounted in the same orientation as the first generation cars. The 420A-powered cars had the engine mounted on the right side of the car, and further back in the chassis. AWD models had a similar transmission to the first generation car. The second-generation GSX also had a stronger carrier/differential when equipped with the limited-slip option.

====Engines====
All motors are four-cylinder gasoline engines. All have cast iron blocks with aluminum cylinder heads. The 4G63/4G64 engines retain the balance shafts for smoother operation, while the 420a does not. The 1995–1999 turbo engines were given an increased compression ratio of 8.5:1, up from 7.8:1, and a smaller turbo, a Garrett T25 set to in place of the previous Mitsubishi TD04-13G turbocharger (automatic cars) and TD05-14B turbocharger (manual cars). This was done to minimize turbo lag, which was an undesirable trait for mass-market appeal in the U.S. These changes led to increased horsepower and torque vs. the previous 1G turbos. The 2G turbo cars produced at 6,000 rpm ( at 6,000 rpm with automatic transmission) and at 3,000 rpm ( at 3,000 rpm with automatic transmission.)

The 4G63T engines found in 1990–1994 models have a throttle body compared to the 1995–1999 MY&#x27;s . The intake ports on the head and runners of the intake manifold are also larger on the 1G. They also have larger crankshaft bearing journals to allow better lubrication. Because they look similar, it is important to note that the 1990-1994 cylinder head is more on the side of high air volume, while the 1995-1999 cylinder head is more on the side of high air velocity.

Mitsubishi Motors quietly updated its 4G63 engine in 1998 and 1999. The crankshaft is more precisely shaved and cut compared to previous years. It is identical to that used in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, which was not yet sold in North America until 2003. The thrust bearings have been revised to a &quot;split&quot; type to allow better lubrication and self-alignment with the crankshaft. It also had improved tuning and functionality thanks to a new ECU, which was similar to Lancer Evolution ECUs. Although originally deactivated to protect the drivetrain, it included advanced features such as launch control, boost control, adjustable rev-limit, fuel system control as well as fuel and boost map selection for certain Mitsubishi Heavy Industries turbochargers.

===Problems and issues===
The second-generation Eclipse received numerous Technical Service Bulletins (TSB) affecting a variety of issues with the car however there was one notable powertrain recall. In March 1998, Mitsubishi issued a recall (bulletin 98V069001) for all 1990–1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse GSXs citing, &quot;Lockup of the transfer case can occur due to insufficient lubrication. The condition can cause a loss of vehicle control increasing the risk of a crash.&quot; The dealers would inspect the vehicles for the adequacy of the transfer case oil volume, transfer case oil leakage, and operational degradation of the transfer case mechanism. The transfer case itself did not leak but rather the brass plug in the center of the transfer case yoke would leak. Mitsubishi estimated 24,275 vehicles were affected.

Another issue that impacted the mid 1995–1997 Eclipse GS-T/GSX (4G63 equipped vehicles) is thrust-bearing failure commonly referred to in the Eclipse community as &quot;crankwalk.&quot; Mitsubishi never publicly addressed the issue via a recall or TSB. There were a variety of symptoms however the most common symptom of crankwalk is the clutch pedal would stick to the floor upon making a left turn. If crankwalk occurred, it typically meant engine failure. In 1998, Mitsubishi revised manufacturing processes to correct the issue.

===Safety===
All 2G Eclipses came standard with driver and front-passenger airbags, side-guard door beams, front and rear body structure crumple zones, 5 mph energy-absorbing bumpers, safety-cage body construction, 4-wheel disc brakes (except RS), three-point ELR/ALR lap/shoulder safety belts (ELR only for the driver) and height-adjustable front shoulder belts. Anti-lock brakes were optional on all models (except for RS).

== Third generation (D52A/D53A; 1999) ==


===Overview===
The Eclipse underwent a change into its third generation in 1999, closely applying the Mitsubishi SST design study which debuted at the 1998 North American International Auto Show. It was the first concept vehicle exhibited by Mitsubishi at an auto show in the U.S.

Two new powertrain options were available, a 2.4 L 16-valve SOHC I4 4G64 and a 24v SOHC 3.0 L V6 (6G72). AWD was no longer an option. The suspension setup was modified to provide a softer and more compliant ride quality.

The third-generation Eclipse shared its powertrain with the eighth-generation Galant. In late 2001, the power of the GT trim was lowered to as a result of tightened emission standards forcing MMNA to adopt the California emissions standards for all variants of the car, rather than selling independent &#x27;Federal Specification&#x27; and &#x27;California Specifications&#x27; versions.

In mid-2002, the GTS trim was introduced for the 2003 model year. This vehicle included an engine with a 10:1 compression ratio, revised camshaft profile, and an improved Mitsubishi Variable Induction Management (MVIM) air intake system that gave the car an extra and a slightly improved power curve. The 2003–2005 GTS coupe, GTS Spyder and GT Spyder shared the new engine while the GT coupe retained the powertrain.

With the introduction of the 2003 GTS model, the Eclipse saw minor changes including a redesigned front bumper with slotted fog lights, as well as a recoloring of the taillights. On the interior, the gauge face changed, and the door panels were also redesigned. Newly designed five-spoke chrome wheels were offered with the GT and GTS trims.

In 2004, Mitsubishi Motors imported the Eclipse Spyder to the Japanese Domestic Market as a special edition.

===Trim levels===
The Eclipse was available in 7 trim levels: RS, GS, GS Spyder, GT, GT Spyder, GTS, and GTS Spyder. All trim levels (besides RS and the Spyder) came with an automatic tilt and retracting sunroof. All models were front-wheel drive (FWD). The GTS trims were introduced for the 2003 model year. For the 2005 model year, the RS trim was discontinued and a special &quot;Remix Edition&quot; GS trim package was introduced, which included chrome wheels, identifying placards, and the premium interior package from the GT and GTS models, which was not previously offered on the GS trim.

*Eclipse RS: Base model equipped with a 2.4 L 16-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 4G64 engine; automatic RS models were only 3G Eclipse without Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;sportronic&quot; select-shift option
*Eclipse GS: Upgraded model equipped with a 2.4 L 16-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 4G64 engine
*Eclipse GS Spyder: Convertible model equipped with a 2.4 L 16-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 4G64 engine
*Eclipse GT: Upgraded model equipped with a 3.0 L 24-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 6G72 engine
*Eclipse GT Spyder: 2000-2002: convertible model equipped with a 3.0 L 24-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 6G72 engine. 2003-2005: convertible FWD model equipped with a 3.0 L 24-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 6G72 engine with MVIM
*Eclipse GTS: Upgraded model equipped with a 3.0 L 24-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 6G72 engine with Mitsubishi Variable Induction Management (MVIM)
*Eclipse GTS Spyder: Convertible model equipped with a 3.0 L 24-valve SOHC Mitsubishi 6G72 engine with MVIM

===Engines===
The third-generation Eclipse utilized two distinct Mitsubishi engines: The SOHC 4G64 2.4 L 16-valve four-cylinder and SOHC 6G72 3.0 L 24-valve V6. Both engines use cast iron blocks with aluminum cylinder heads. The four-cylinder, found in the RS, GS, and GS Spyder trims, used a 9:1 compression ratio and produced an output of and of torque throughout all years.

The 3.0 L V6, however, used in GT and GT Spyder models, produced in Federal Specifications between 2000-2001 and in all GT models in California Specifications, all years with a static compression ratio of 9:1. In 2003, the 3.0 L V6 was improved for the GTS and GT/GTS Spyder, using a revised camshaft profile, raised compression ratio of 10:1 and variable-length MVIM intake manifold. This engine produced .

===2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse EV===
The Mitsubishi Eclipse EV is a prototype electric vehicle with a lightweight electric motor and lithium-ion batteries in the chassis of a third-generation Eclipse. It is powered by manganese lithium-ion batteries made by Japan Storage Battery, which have 65% reduced charging time over nickel-hydrogen batteries.

The prototype model participated in the 2001 Shikoku EV Rally, a circuit around the perimeter of Shikoku, Japan, where it drove in excess of on a single battery charge.
== Fourth generation (DK2A/DK4A; 2005) ==
===Overview===
Another substantial styling revision was introduced, with the fourth-generation model taking some of the profile from the second generation model but maintaining a front fascia consistent with Mitsubishi&#x27;s corporate styling features of the time. Drivetrain features include a 3.8 L MIVEC V6 engine for the GT trim, 2009 and newer models have . The GS has a 2.4 L MIVEC four-cylinder engine, both derived from the Mitsubishi PS platform family, with which the Eclipse shares many mechanical components. Like the 2004 Galant and third-generation Eclipse, the fourth-generation Eclipse is FWD only, although a concept model has been produced by Mitsubishi and Ralliart with a MillenWorks designed hybrid-electric AWD platform, the 4G63 engine from the Lancer Evolution, and more aggressive body styling with imitation carbon fiber accents. The V6 produces and of torque.

The fourth-generation Spyder (convertible) Eclipse was released for the 2007 model year at the North American International Auto Show.

===Trim levels===
For the 2010 model year in the U.S., its primary market, the Eclipse was available in five trim levels: GS, GS Sport Spyder, SE, GT, and GT Spyder. In Mexico, the GT Spyder is known as the Eclipse Convertible. In Canada, the GT trim is known as the GT-P. The SE package was available in either GS or GT trim specs, however included optional equipment.

*GT - Equipped with the V6 with bore X stroke SOHC 4 valves per cylinder 60° V-block 6G75 engine capable of making in factory trim and a compression ratio of 10.5:1. The firing order is 1-2-3-4-5-6. It uses 315 cc top feed high impedance injectors with a returnless fuel rail. It has a 65 mm throttle body. The stock exhaust diameter is 2 1/4&quot;. Since 2009, power is upgraded to at 5750 rpm and at 4500 rpm of torque. The intake valves begin to open at 5° before top dead center, and close 55° after top dead center. The exhaust valves open 51° after top dead center, and close 17° after top dead center. The oil pump is a trochoid type. The cooling system is water cooled forced circulation with a centrifugal impeller type pump.

===Facelifts===
The Mitsubishi Eclipse was given a minor facelift for the 2009 model year, the front fascia changed the fog lights and deleted the triangle housing the &quot;three diamond&quot; logo used to sit on in the grille; the rear fascia changed the &quot;Eclipse&quot; insignia from an indent to raised silver letters. An option to add a dual exhaust and projector H.I.D. headlamps also became available. The V6 engine now rated at and of torque in part due to the more open front fascia as well as a new stock dual exhaust system. It was unveiled at the 2008 Chicago Auto Show.

For 2011, the Mitsubishi Eclipse featured a &quot;blackout&quot; roof, similar to the 1990 model. Mitsubishi also lowered the suspension of Eclipse about half an inch to lower the center of gravity. A rear backup camera and Bluetooth hands-free calling to the Sun and sound package were included. In the GS trim, the car gets the same 18-inch wheels and blackout front end as the GT model called the GS Sport.

===Final model year===
For the 2012 model year, the Eclipse received three slight changes: brake override logic, a clear lip spoiler on the GT trim, and one new exterior color. According to a review and rating by &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, the fourth-generation Eclipse was described as &quot;dated&quot; - but its &quot;exterior design still stands out among sporty coupes currently available.&quot; The 2012 model year Eclipse was now six years old and &quot;is still trying to pass itself off as a sporty two-door.&quot; This was the final model year, albeit a short run because production ended in August 2011.

The last Eclipse to roll off the assembly line was built on 16 August 2011, painted Kalapana Black. Its color was chosen by members of Mitsubishi&#x27;s Facebook community, who picked from a historical Eclipse color palette. This was the only Eclipse equipped with both the 3.8L/265 hp V6 engine and the commemorative SE package, as well as special 18-inch Dark Argent alloy wheels and one-of-a-kind graphics. It is also built with a sunroof, leather interior, 650W Rockford Fosgate 9-speaker audio system with Sirius XM, hands-free Bluetooth phone interface, rear-view camera, and HID headlights. The car was auctioned off by Mecum Auctions in St. Charles, Illinois on 17 September 2012, for $35,000. Proceeds went to the Japanese Red Cross to aid victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

Grand total Eclipse production was 906,876 units.

===Recalls===
*05V247000 - Recalled 6 February 2005, vehicles were found equipped with faulty brake booster assemblies. The brake booster could separate due to improper crimp joints resulting in total brake failure
*05V299000 - Recalled 27 June 2005, master cylinders were found to have improperly installed seals. Brake fluid may bypass the seal and result in longer pedal stroke, and reduced braking pressure
*15V337000 - Recalled 6 February 2015, vehicles made between 23 December 2005 and 13 February 2009 were recalled for corrosion issues in the ABS unit. This can cause internal valves to seize, resulting in sudden brake failure or reduced stopping ability
*08V454000 - Recalled 9 September 2008, certain 2005-2007 vehicles had improper fuel tank mounting brackets which could split. This could result in the fuel tank to come undone in a collision and potentially cause a fuel leak.

==Motorsport==
The Eclipse has been campaigned in various auto racing events.

===Rally, endurance and road racing===
The Eclipse, and its Chrysler-branded counterparts, have competed in Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) events.

In 1995, a GT2 class specification Eclipse GSX was entered into the annual 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race. It was placed on grid number 74, at the back in last place. It moved up to 24th place overall finish without any issues. It nearly set a new record as well, passing a total of 50 cars. In 1998, it entered the race again but was now in a lower specification class (GT3/GTS3). It finished in 24th place. In 1999, the Eclipse made its final appearance in the race, achieving 39th place, after posting 455 laps. The name of the team was Spirit of Daytona and their sponsor was Daytona Mitsubishi. Craig Conway, Eric Van Cleef, and Todd Flis were the drivers.

In 2004 and 2005, Greg Collier won the NASA Super Unlimited class national title in a Plymouth Laser RS Turbo. These wins were over purpose-built Ferrari Challenge and Porsche Carrera Cup race cars.

In 2009 and 2010, an Eclipse Spyder GS-T driven by Matt Andrews and Andrew Brilliant won the Super Lap Battle Limited championship in Willow Springs, California.

In 2012, a heavily built and tuned Mitsubishi Eclipse piloted by Mark Rybníček won the Czech Hill Climb championship. Other drivers such as Karel Stehlik and David Komarek have used Eclipses in hill climb competition as well. Some of engines produce as much as . They also have short transmission gears to accelerate to triple-digit speeds.

===Drag racing===
Brent Rau has won three world drag racing championships using an Eclipse; IDRC, NDRA, and NHRA. Many other notable names have also claimed big wins piloting Eclipses for drag racing as well.

Jett Racing entered a third-generation Eclipse for drag racing competition. As of 2014, they hold the world record for the world&#x27;s fastest four-cylinder. It has and is RWD. It is capable of over . On 29 November 2018, they ran 6.2 seconds in the quarter-mile with a top speed of .

<text>Fries&#x27;s Rebellion (), also called House Tax Rebellion, the Home Tax Rebellion and, in Pennsylvania German, the Heesses-Wasser Uffschtand, was an armed tax revolt among Pennsylvania Dutch farmers between 1799 and 1800. It was the third of three tax-related rebellions in the 18th century United States, the earlier two being Shays&#x27; Rebellion (central and western Massachusetts, 1786–87) and the Whiskey Rebellion (western Pennsylvania, 1794). It was commemorated in 2003 with a Pennsylvania historical marker erected in Quakertown, Pennsylvania, where it first erupted.

==Background==
When the Quasi-War with France threatened to escalate in 1798, Congress raised a large army and enlarged the navy. To pay for it, Congress in July 1798 imposed $2 million in new taxes on real estate and slaves, apportioned among the states according to the requirements of the Constitution. It was the first (and only) such federal tax.

Congress had also recently passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, criminalizing dissent and increasing the power of the executive branch under John Adams.

==Beginning==
In July 1798, during the troubles between the United States and France now known as the Quasi-War, the US Congress levied a direct tax (on dwelling-houses, lands and slaves; sometimes called the Direct House Tax of 1798) of $2 million, of which Pennsylvania&#x27;s share would have been $237,000.

There were very few slaves in Pennsylvania, and the tax was accordingly assessed upon dwelling-houses and land, the value of the houses being determined by the number and size of the windows. For many residence of the area, this came to be known as The Window Tax. The inquisitorial nature of the proceedings, with assessors riding around and counting windows, aroused strong opposition, and many refused to pay, making the constitutional argument that this tax was not being levied in proportion to population. Pennsylvania German farmers were also upset at the fact that the tax assessors were largely Quakers and Moravians, neither of which fought in the American Revolution, while the majority of farmers did.

Pennsylvania auctioneer John Fries organized meetings, starting in February 1799, to discuss a collective response to the tax. As an itinerant auctioneer, Fries was well acquainted with the German-Americans&#x27; issues in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania. This was important because the three counties in which the opposition was centered (Bucks, Northampton, and Montgomery) were heavily populated by German immigrants. In Milford township, particularly, assessors were unsuccessful in completing their tax assessments due to intimidation. At a meeting called by government representatives in an attempt to explain the tax in a way as to defuse tensions, protesters waving liberty flags, some armed and in Continental Army uniforms, shouted them down and turned the meeting into a protest rally.

The assessors at first determined to continue their work in Milford. Fries personally warned the assessors to quit their work, but they ignored the threat. He then led a small armed band that harassed the assessors enough that they decided to abandon Milford for the time being.

In early March, a local militia company and a growing force of armed irregulars met, marching to the accompaniment of drum and fife. About a hundred set off for Quakertown in pursuit of the assessors, whom they intended to place under arrest. They captured a number of assessors there, releasing them with a warning not to return and to tell the government what had happened to them.

==Spread==
Opposition to the tax spread to other parts of Pennsylvania. In Penn, the appointed assessor resigned under public threats; the assessors in Hamilton Township and Northampton Township also begged to resign, but were refused as nobody else could be found to take their places.

Federal warrants were issued, and the U.S. Marshal began arresting people for tax resistance in Northampton. Arrests were made without much incident until the marshal reached Macungie, then known as Millerstown, where a crowd formed to protect a man from arrest. Failing to make that arrest, the marshal made a few others and returned to Bethlehem with his prisoners.

Two separate groups of rebels independently vowed to liberate the prisoners, and marched on Bethlehem. They prevailed without violence, and freed the tax resisters who had been arrested. In response to this action, President John Adams called out a force of federal troops and local militia. They marched into the rebellious counties and began making wholesale arrests of the insurgents. John Fries was among the men captured.

==Trials==
Thirty men went on trial in Federal court. Fries, Frederick Heaney (Hoenig/Haney), and John Getman were tried for treason and, with Federalists stirring up a frenzy, were sentenced to be hanged. President John Adams pardoned Fries and others convicted of treason. Adams was prompted by the narrower constitutional definition of treason, and he later added that the rebels were &quot;obscure, miserable Germans, as ignorant of our language as they were of our laws&quot; and were being used by &quot;great men&quot; in the opposition party. He issued a general amnesty for everyone involved on May 21, 1800.

Historians are in agreement that the Federalists overreacted and mishandled a small episode. The long-term impact was that the German-American communities rejected the Federalist Party.

<text>Basil Glen Ballard Jr. (born May 1, 1953) is an American songwriter, lyricist, and record producer. He is best known for co-writing and producing on Wilson Phillips&#x27; debut and sophomore albums, &quot;Wilson Phillips&quot; and &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;, as well as co-writing and producing on Alanis Morissette&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; and Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Everyday&quot;. As a songwriter, he co-wrote songs including &quot;All I Need&quot;, &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Hand in My Pocket&quot;, and Josh Groban&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot;. As a producer, he has worked with No Doubt, Shelby Lynne, Goo Goo Dolls, P.O.D., Annie Lennox and others.

Ballard founded the production company Augury in 2011. In collaboration with Alan Silvestri, he wrote the score for a musical adaptation of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2023.

==Early life==
Ballard grew up in Natchez, Mississippi, where he began playing the piano and writing songs at an early age. He began playing guitar and playing in a band called the Unknowns beginning in the fourth grade. While attending the University of Mississippi he released a solo album. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English, journalism, and political science, graduating in 1975.

==Career==
===1970s===
After college, Ballard moved to Los Angeles with $400 and the phone number of the only person his uncle knew in L.A., a golf pro at the Bel-Air Country Club, whom Ballard called and asked if they knew anyone in the music business. The only person they knew was Tutti Camarata, the owner of Sunset Sound Recorders, who invited Ballard to a recording session. Camerata offered Ballard some studio time, which Ballard used to develop his songwriting, arranging, and production skills. He began working for a division of Rocket Records and continued learning about the music business. In 1978 Ballard wrote a song for Rocket artist Kiki Dee, which led to his being signed as a staff songwriter for MCA Music Publishing. 

===1980s===
Ballard wrote, played, and produced an increasing number of songs and projects in the 1980s, contributing to albums by the Pointer Sisters, Paula Abdul, Camilo Sesto, and others. He co-wrote and produced the title track &quot;All I Need&quot; on Jack Wagner&#x27;s 1984 debut album All I Need. He also co-wrote the song &quot;You Look So Good in Love&quot;, a hit for George Strait in 1983 and one of Strait&#x27;s biggest hits.

When a song Ballard co-wrote was included on George Benson&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;Give Me the Night&quot;, Quincy Jones took notice of his abilities, and in 1985 Jones hired Ballard as a songwriter and producer for his Qwest Records label. In 1987, when Jones invited a group of songwriters to his home to write hit songs for Michael Jackson&#x27;s upcoming album, Siedah Garrett and Ballard co-wrote &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;. The song topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks, and was certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Record of the Year at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards.

In 1989, producer Richard Perry introduced Ballard to Wilson Phillips, and they collaborated in his Encino home studio to produce a four-song demo that included the song &quot;Hold On&quot;, co-written by Ballard. The demo earned the group a record deal, and Ballard produced the trio&#x27;s commercially successful debut album, released in 1990. &quot;Hold On&quot; was the album&#x27;s lead single and won the Billboard Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year for 1990. It became a worldwide hit, earning two nominations at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song 15th on its list of &quot;100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time&quot;.

===1990s===
Ballard and Garrett collaborated with Jackson to write the song &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; from his 1991 album, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, and the song &quot;I Never Even Told You&quot;, included on for the 1993 animated film &quot;&quot;. In 1992, Ballard worked with Wilson Phillips on their second studio album, &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;.

In March 1994, Ballard&#x27;s publishing company introduced him to Alanis Morissette, and the two worked together at Ballard&#x27;s home studio to write and record demos of the songs that became &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. Ballard and Morissette took the demos to various record labels that passed. In January 1995, they approached Guy Oseary at Maverick Records, who signed Morissette. Released in June 1995, the album was the best-selling album of 1996, and won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album and Album of the Year. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, and ranked by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Morissette again collaborated with Ballard on her 1998 follow-up, &quot;Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie&quot;.

Other artists with whom Ballard co-wrote and/or co-produced projects in the 1990s include Curtis Stigers, Lea Salonga, Van Halen, Aerosmith, and The Corrs. In 1997, he launched Java Records as a joint venture with Capitol Records. He wrote the screenplay for the 1999 film &quot;Clubland&quot;, a music-driven film about an aspiring musician in Los Angeles.

===2000s===
In 2000, Dave Matthews flew to Los Angeles to meet with Ballard with the intention of finishing material for an upcoming Dave Matthews Band album, and ended up co-writing 12 new songs with Ballard in 10 days. Ballard produced the album, &quot;Everyday&quot;, which was released the next year. In 2001, Ballard&#x27;s Java label moved from Capitol to the Island/Def Jam family of labels.

In 2001 a 17-year-old Katy Perry, then known as Katy Hudson, moved to Los Angeles to work with Ballard due to his past work with Morissette, one of her major inspirations. In 2004 she signed to Ballard&#x27;s Java Records label and began work on a solo record to be released in 2005, but the record was shelved after the label was dropped. Ballard introduced her to Tim Devine at Columbia Records, where she was signed as a solo artist.

Ballard worked with Lisa Marie Presley to develop her debut 2003 album&quot;To Whom It May Concern&quot;, co-writing five of its tracks. He also produced or co-produced albums by No Doubt, Shelby Lynne, Goo Goo Dolls, P.O.D., Annie Lennox, Anouk, and Idina Menzel. Together with Dave Stewart he established Sly-Fi, a production partnership.

On January 31, 2014, it was announced that &quot;Back to the Future: The Musical&quot;, a stage musical adaptation of the 1985 film, was in production.

<text>Mark Henry Rowswell, CM (born May 23, 1965), better known by his Chinese stage name Dashan (), is a Canadian comedian, &quot;xiangsheng&quot; performer, and television personality popular in China. Relatively unknown in the West, from the late 1980s through the early 2000s Dashan was one of the most famous Western personalities in China&#x27;s media industry, where he occupied a unique position as a foreign national who had become a domestic celebrity, largely through his repeated appearances on China Central Television (CCTV) during that period. Since 2012 Dashan has largely turned away from mainstream media to focus on solo performances in live venues, helping to introduce stand-up comedy to China.

== Biography ==

=== Education ===
Rowswell was born in 1965 in Ottawa, Ontario, and attended Nepean High School. He started learning Chinese in 1979 from a refugee that he worked alongside in a camera store on Bank Street. After learning a few words, Rowswell bought books and cassettes teaching the language.

Rowswell enrolled at the University of Toronto, initially to study philosophy, because his parents preferred that he study abroad in China if he wanted to learn Chinese. However, Rowswell switched to formally studying Chinese early on as an undergraduate. His original Chinese name, as given by his Canadian Chinese-language teacher, was Lu Shiwei () based on his surname Rowswell. Upon graduation from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts in Chinese studies in 1988, Rowswell was easily able to secure an exchange position with a full scholarship at Peking University to continue his Chinese studies.

=== Early television appearances ===
Rowswell first appeared on Chinese television to co-host an international singing competition later in 1988. The producers wanted a foreigner with fluent Mandarin, and selected Rowswell from a field of candidates partly because of his Chinese studies degree from the University of Toronto. Afterwards, he was invited to perform a comedic skit on national television during the &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot;, a variety program broadcast to an estimated audience of 550 million people by the state broadcaster. Rowswell portrayed a sassy peasant with a no-nonsense wife during the skit, which was called &quot;Ye gui&quot; (). The name &quot;Dashan&quot; (&quot;big mountain&quot; in Chinese) was the name of his character in the skit, Xu Dashan (). The skit propelled him to national stardom overnight because of his fluent Chinese and delivery.

After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, as many Westerners in China left as sanctions were applied, Dashan decided to stay in China and continue his career on state television. In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, he called the decision &quot;the original sin of Dashan&quot;, but also theorized that it defined him to his Chinese audience as a true friend in contrast to the fairweather friends who left.

Due to the abrupt nature of Dashan&#x27;s rise to fame, he has been called an &quot;accidental celebrity&quot;. However, his subsequent longevity and continuing prominence in the Chinese media more than two decades later suggest something more substantial. Many foreign nationals appear regularly on Chinese television, and foreigners fluent in the Chinese language are no longer a rarity. Yet no other foreign national has come close to the level of recognition and popularity in China enjoyed by Dashan.

==== Xiangsheng ====
Following Rowswell&#x27;s first appearance as &quot;Dashan&quot;, he began formal study of xiangsheng with his mentor, comedian Jiang Kun. In December 1989, Dashan became the first foreigner to be formally accepted into the strict xiangsheng hierarchy as a member of the &quot;9th generation&quot;, a move that caused considerable controversy in Chinese performing arts circles at the time. Xiangsheng is often called &quot;the art of comedic language&quot;, and as such is regarded in China as a highly skilled form of performing art beyond the reach of most native speakers, much less a foreigner.

=== 1990–2012 ===

==== &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; ====
Through the 1990s, Dashan appeared frequently on national and regional television programs across China to perform xiangsheng and comedic skits, including several appearances on CCTV&#x27;s annual television program celebrating the Chinese New Year, &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot;, in 1998 and 1999. This program is China&#x27;s most watched annual television event, with an estimated audience of 900 million to 1 billion viewers. Appearances on this and other programs gained Dashan wide recognition throughout China.

Dashan&#x27;s public xiangsheng performances decreased in the early 21st century. In a 2005 interview with the &quot;Chongqing Evening News&quot;, Dashan stated that he seldom performs xiangsheng due to the increased requirements that performers stick to a stipulated topic as well as exceeding audience expectations since his televised debut.

In early 2009 Dashan made a return to the &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; to perform a xiangsheng skit in which he appeared together with Ma Dong, son of the famous xiangsheng master Ma Ji. The skit received 2nd Prize in the audience choice awards announced at the end of the Chinese New Year holiday. With this performance, Dashan became (at the time) the only foreign national to have appeared on the &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; a total of three times.

Dashan made a fourth appearance on the &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; in 2011, in a skit introducing and performing with several foreign students studying Chinese at Confucius Institutes. The skit had no accompanied Chinese performers and was awarded second prize in the audience choice awards.

==== Television host ====
With the move away from xiangsheng, throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s Dashan increasingly worked in a non-comedic role as a freelance host or presenter of many varied television programs and live events, especially those with an international focus and requiring a bilingual (English/Chinese) emcee.

Dashan also hosted numerous educational programs. Most notable of these include the ESL series &quot;Dashan and Friends&quot; () and &quot;Dashan&#x27;s Adventures&quot; () and programs teaching Chinese as a foreign language for CCTV International, including &quot;Travel In Chinese&quot; ().

==== Dramatic acting ====
Dashan has occasionally delved into dramatic acting, often to portray other famous foreigners in Chinese history. In 2005, he played the lead role in a 24-part television series &quot;Palace Artist&quot; () broadcast by China Central Television, as the 18th-century Italian Jesuit painter Giuseppe Castiglione. In 2006 and 2007, Dashan performed the lead role in &quot;Red Star Over China&quot; (), a stage play based on the life and work of the American reporter Edgar Snow. In 2007 and 2008 he starred in a Chinese stage adaptation of the French comedy &quot;Le Dîner de Cons&quot; (&quot;The Dinner Game&quot; in English, ), which toured across China and for which he was awarded the prestigious White Magnolia Award for best supporting actor.

==== Beijing Olympics ====
Dashan served as team attaché to the Canadian Olympic Committee for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.

==== Cultural ambassador ====
In many instances, Dashan has transcended the role of celebrity performer to become a cultural ambassador between China and the West, both in an informal as well as official capacity.

Dashan served as Commissioner General for Canada at the Shanghai 2010 World Expo.

During his official visit to China in February 2012, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced: &quot;For many years Mark Rowswell has used his extraordinary talents to build bridges of understanding between Canada and China. I am pleased to name this highly recognized and respected individual as Canada&#x27;s Goodwill Ambassador to China.&quot;

== Current work ==
In recent years Dashan has largely turned away from television to focus on solo performances in live venues and on social media.

=== Dashan Live ===
Since 2012 Dashan has been &quot;on a mission to introduce stand-up comedy to China&quot;, performing in small clubs and at universities across China. In June 2014 he announced his plan to develop a travelling show, the Burned Out, Washed Up, Never Say Farewell tour.

This later became known as his solo comedy special &quot;Dashan Live&quot; (), which he has toured throughout China and to Chinese communities abroad.

In 2015, Dashan performed at the Flushing Comedy Club, a temporary Chinese comedy club in Flushing, Queens set up in a teahouse by Des Bishop. The club alternated all-Mandarin and all-English comedy nights; Dashan performed during the first all-Mandarin night.

In May 2016, after local officials in Suzhou shut down one of his shows, he considered leaving China for good. In 2017 Dashan was the only Mandarin performer at the 2017 Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the third-largest international comedy festival in the world and the largest cultural event in Australia.

Dashan considers his stand-up as a mix of Western stand-up and Chinese xiangsheng.

=== Narration ===
Dashan&#x27;s distinctive voice has been featured in many Mandarin language narration and spoken word performances, including the children&#x27;s story &quot;Guess How Much I Love You&quot; as performed by Mermaid Theatre of Nova Scotia, &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; as performed by the New York Philharmonic in Shanghai, an original Mandarin version of &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;, performed with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and modern Chinese poetry for the popular WeChat channel &quot;The Poem For You&quot; ().

On June 29, 2011, the National Gallery of Canada launched an audio tour that was recorded by Dashan. The tour features Dashan speaking in Mandarin about the gallery&#x27;s Canadian art collection.

In 2024, Dashan returned to China to participate in the adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; directed by Zhang Guoli, playing the role of &quot;Red&quot;, the narrator of the story. When asked about the play’s sensitive themes, he said, “Sure, it’s about a corrupt system that makes you think you’re trapped and you’ll never get out. But really, it’s mostly about hope. What’s wrong with that?”

=== Endorsements and cameo appearances ===
Dashan&#x27;s name and image can often be seen in commercial endorsements for various Chinese and international companies, including Canadian Ford automobiles starting in 2007 and 2008. Dashan is also active as a spokesman for several charity organizations, primarily involved with cancer prevention as well as environmental protection.

=== University of Toronto Governing Council ===
On April 30, 2014, Dashan was appointed to a three-year term as a member of Governing Council of the University of Toronto, and was renewed for another three-year term in 2017. He also serves on the university&#x27;s Asia International Leadership Council.

== Personal life ==

<doc id="570660" wikidata="Q699702" url="?curid=570660" title="Jonas Mekas">
<text>Jonas Mekas (; ; December 24, 1922 – January 23, 2019) was a Lithuanian-American filmmaker, poet, and artist who has been called &quot;the godfather of American avant-garde cinema&quot;. Mekas&#x27;s work has been exhibited in museums and at festivals worldwide. Mekas was active in New York City, where he co-founded Anthology Film Archives, The Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative, and the journal &quot;Film Culture&quot;. He was also the first film critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

In the 1960s, Mekas launched anti-censorship campaigns in defense of the LGBTQ-themed films of Jean Genet and Jack Smith, garnering support from cultural figures including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Norman Mailer, and Susan Sontag. Mekas mentored and supported many prominent artists and filmmakers, including Ken Jacobs, Peter Bogdanovich, Chantal Akerman, Richard Foreman, John Waters, Barbara Rubin, Yoko Ono, and Martin Scorsese. He helped launch the writing careers of the critics Andrew Sarris, Amy Taubin, and J. Hoberman. 

During World War II, Mekas edited and contributed to two far-right, collaborationist newspapers under the Nazi occupation of Lithuania, the significance of which has been debated by historians.

His major films include &quot;The Brig&quot; (1964), &quot;Walden: Diaries Notes and Sketches&quot; (1968), and &quot;Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania&quot; (1972). His early poetry collection, &quot;Idylls of Semeniskiai&quot; (1948), is a celebrated work in his native Lithuania.

==Early life==
Mekas was born in Semeniškiai, the son of Elzbieta (Jašinskaitė) and Povilas Mekas on December 24, 1922. As a teenager, he attended the Biržai Gymnasium in Biržai, Lithuania. From 1941 to 1942, living under Nazi occupation, he co-edited and published in the culture section of &quot;Naujosios Biržų žinios&quot;, founded by the far-right, anti-semitic Lithuanian Activist Front. From 1943 to 1944, he co-edited and published in the culture section of &quot;Panevėžio apygardos balsas&quot;, a weekly local newspaper published by the fascist .

In 1944, Mekas left Lithuania with his brother, Adolfas Mekas. They attempted to reach neutral Switzerland by means of Vienna, with fabricated student papers arranged by their uncle. Their train was stopped in Germany, and they were both imprisoned in a labor camp in Elmshorn, a suburb of Hamburg, for eight months. The brothers escaped and hid on a farm near the Danish border for two months until the end of the war. After the war, Mekas lived in displaced persons&#x27; camps in Wiesbaden and Kassel. From 1946 to 1948, he studied philosophy at the University of Mainz. By the end of 1949 his brother and he had both secured sponsorship through a job in Chicago and emigrated to the United States. When they arrived, the two decided to settle in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Two weeks after his arrival, he borrowed money to buy his first Bolex 16mm camera and began recording moments of his life.

He discovered avant-garde film at venues such as Amos Vogel&#x27;s pioneering Cinema 16, and he began curating avant-garde film screenings at Gallery East on Avenue A and Houston Street and at the Film Forum series at Carl Fisher Auditorium on 57th Street.

==Career==
In 1954, Mekas and his brother Adolfas founded the journal &quot;Film Culture&quot;, and in 1958 he began writing his &quot;Movie Journal&quot; column for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In 1962, he co-founded The Film-Makers&#x27; Cooperative, and in 1964 the Filmmakers&#x27; Cinematheque, which eventually became Anthology Film Archives, one of the world&#x27;s largest and most important repositories of avant-garde film. Along with Lionel Rogosin, he was part of the New American Cinema movement. He was a close collaborator with artists such as Marie Menken, Andy Warhol, Nico, Allen Ginsberg, Yoko Ono, John Lennon, Salvador Dalí, and fellow Lithuanian George Maciunas.

After leaving &quot;The Voice&quot; over an editorial dispute, for a short time he wrote a column for The &quot;SoHo Weekly News.&quot; 

Mekas gave the film &quot;Heaven and Earth Magic&quot; its title in 1964/65.

In 1964, Mekas was arrested on obscenity charges for showing &quot;Flaming Creatures&quot; (1963) and Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;Un Chant d&#x27;Amour&quot; (1950). He launched a campaign against the censorship board, and for the next few years continued to exhibit films at the Filmmakers&#x27; Cinematheque, the Jewish Museum, and the Gallery of Modern Art. From 1964 to 1967, he organized the New American Cinema Expositions, which toured Europe and South America, and in 1966 joined the 80 Wooster Fluxhouse Coop.
In 1970, Anthology Film Archives opened on 425 Lafayette Street as a film museum, screening space, and library, with Mekas as its director. Mekas, along with Stan Brakhage, Ken Kelman, Peter Kubelka, James Broughton, and P. Adams Sitney, began the ambitious Essential Cinema project at Anthology Film Archives to establish a canon of important cinematic works. Mekas&#x27;s legs appeared in John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s experimental film &quot;Up Your Legs Forever&quot; (1971).

As a filmmaker, Mekas&#x27;s own output ranged from his early narrative film &quot;Guns of the Trees (&quot;1961) to &quot;diary films&quot; such as &quot;Walden&quot; (1969); &quot;Lost, Lost, Lost&quot; (1975), &quot;Reminiscences of a Journey to Lithuania&quot; (1972), &quot;Zefiro Torna&quot; (1992), and &quot;As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty&quot; (2000), which have been screened at festivals and museums around the world. Mekas&#x27; diary films offered a new perspective to the genre and portrayed the cinematic avant-garde scene of the 1960s.

Mekas expanded the scope of his practice with his later works of multi-monitor installations, sound immersion pieces and &quot;frozen-film&quot; prints. Together they offer a new experience of his classic films and a novel presentation of his more recent video work. His work has been exhibited at the 51st Venice Biennial, PS1 Contemporary Art Center, the Ludwig Museum, the Serpentine Gallery, the Jewish Museum, and the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center.

In 2007, Mekas released one film every day on his website, a project he entitled &quot;The 365 Day Project.&quot; The online diary is still ongoing on Jonas Mekas&#x27;s official website. It was celebrated in 2015 with a show titled &quot;The Internet Saga&quot; which was curated by Francesco Urbano Ragazzi at Palazzo Foscari Contarini on the occasion of the 56th Venice Biennale of Visual Arts.

Beginning in the 1970s, Mekas taught film courses at the New School for Social Research, MIT, Cooper Union, and New York University.

Additionally, Mekas was a writer and published his poems and prose in Lithuanian, French, German, and English. His work has been translated into English by the Lithuanian-American poet Vyt Bakaitis in such collections as &quot;Daybooks: 1970-1972&quot; (Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs, 2003) and a bilingual anthology of modern Lithuanian verse, &quot;Gyvas atodūsis/Breathing Free, poems&quot; (Lietuvos, 2001). Mekas published many of his journals and diaries, including &quot;I Had Nowhere to Go: Diaries, 1944–1954&quot; and &quot;Letters from Nowhere&quot;, as well as articles on film criticism, theory, and technique. In 2007, the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Center was opened in Vilnius.

One of Mekas&#x27;s last exhibitions, &quot;Notes from Downtown,&quot; took place at James Fuentes Gallery on the Lower East Side in 2018. Mekas&#x27;s last work, &quot;Requiem,&quot; premiered posthumously at The Shed in New York City on November 1, 2019. The 84-minute video was commissioned by The Shed and Festspielhaus Baden-Baden. It screened in tandem with a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, conducted by Teodor Currentzis and performed by the musicAeterna orchestra.

In 2018, Ina Navazelskis, an oral historian at the National Institute for Holocaust Documentation, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interviewed Mekas for their Jeff and Toby Herr Oral History Archive. There, he discussed his memories of World War II

&quot;Jonas Mekas: The Camera Was Always Running&quot;, the filmmaker&#x27;s first retrospective in the United States, was organized by Guest Curator Kelly Taxter and on view at the Jewish Museum in the spring of 2022.

German filmmaker Peter Sempel has made three films about Mekas&#x27; works and life, &quot;Jonas in the Desert&quot; (1991), &quot;Jonas at the Ocean&quot; (2004), and &quot;Jonas in the Jungle&quot; (2013).

==Personal life==
Mekas married Hollis Melton in 1974. They had two children, a daughter, Oona, and a son, Sebastian. His family is featured in Jonas&#x27;s films, including &quot;Out-takes from the Life of a Happy Man&quot; and &quot;As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty&quot;.

Mekas died at his home in Brooklyn on January 23, 2019, at the age of 96.

Mekas is the subject of a documentary, &quot;Fragments of Paradise&quot;, which premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival. The film received the award for Best Documentary on Cinema at the Festival.

==Controversy over World War II activities==
Mekas long maintained that, while working for local newspapers, he also clandestinely-transcribed BBC broadcasts in support of the underground. In 2018, an article in &quot;the New York Review of Books&quot; by historian Michael Casper challenged Mekas&#x27;s versions of his wartime activities. Casper claims that Mekas participated &quot;in an underground movement in Biržai that supported the 1941 Nazi invasion of Soviet Lithuania&quot; and worked for &quot;two ultranationalist and Nazi propaganda newspapers, until he fled Lithuania in 1944.&quot; Casper noted that Mekas&#x27;s publications in these newspapers were not anti-Semitic. 

At the time, art critic and historian Barry Schwabsky penned a letter to the editor criticizing Casper&#x27;s essay. He and Casper had an exchange of letters in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&#x27;s website biography of Mekas maintains that he participated in both the anti-Soviet and anti-Nazi undergrounds. Following the 2022 exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York, Casper published an article entitled &quot;World War II Revisionism at the Jewish Museum&quot; in &quot;Jewish Currents&quot;. There, he argued that the &quot;art world at large remains deeply invested in the story of Mekas the anti-Nazi&quot;, thus perpetuating revisionism not only erasing his roles, but casting him as an anti-Nazi hero.

In an article for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency on Casper&#x27;s charges against the Jewish Museum, journalist Asaf Shalev also pointed out that two different memos were circulated among the museum employees to dismiss Casper&#x27;s article. Kelly Taxter, the guest curator of the exhibit, responded to Casper&#x27;s historical research by saying that &quot;the tone of these emails is often aggressive.&quot; This was based on emails shared by the Mekas family, which Shalev also had access to, although Shalev wrote that &quot;Nothing on there looked to me like Casper was bullying Mekas or that Mekas get bullied.&quot;

Sovietologist Robert van Voren voiced criticisms of Casper&#x27;s articles. Saulius Sužiedėlis argued, &quot;The review format of the articles allowed Casper to present judgements without the burden of buttressing his allegations with relevant sources and requisite detail. The resulting narrative turns Jonas Mekas&#x27;s life as a young man into something that it was not.&quot; 

The film scholars J. Hoberman and B. Ruby Rich have shown support for Casper&#x27;s findings. An article in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, B. Ruby Rich stated that, upon Casper&#x27;s article, &quot;The wagons started circling immediately to protect a sacred figure of the avant-garde.&quot; In 2023, both Casper and Sužiedėlis shared their research and perspectives on Mekas in separate interviews with Lithuanian journalist Karolis Vyšniauskas.

<text>Universal health care (also called universal health coverage, universal coverage, or universal care) is a health care system in which all residents of a particular country or region are assured access to health care. It is generally organized around providing either all residents or only those who cannot afford on their own, with either health services or the means to acquire them, with the end goal of improving health outcomes.

Some universal healthcare systems are government-funded, while others are based on a requirement that all citizens purchase private health insurance. Universal healthcare can be determined by three critical dimensions: who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered. It is described by the World Health Organization as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship. Then-Director General of the WHO Margaret Chan described universal health coverage as the &quot;single most powerful concept that public health has to offer&quot; since it unifies &quot;services and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way&quot;. One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health. Critics say that universal healthcare leads to longer wait times and worse quality healthcare.

As part of Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations member states have agreed to work toward worldwide universal health coverage by 2030. Therefore, the inclusion of the universal health coverage (UHC) within the SDGs targets can be related to the reiterated endorsements operated by the WHO.

==History==

&quot;Note: Links in table are &quot;Healthcare in COUNTRY&quot;.&quot;



The first move towards a national health insurance system was launched in Germany in 1883, with the Sickness Insurance Law. Industrial employers were mandated to provide injury and illness insurance for their low-wage workers, and the system was funded and administered by employees and employers through &quot;sick funds&quot;, which were drawn from deductions in workers&#x27; wages and from employers&#x27; contributions. This social health insurance model, named the Bismarck Model after Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, was the first form of universal care in modern times. Other countries soon began to follow suit. In the United Kingdom, the National Insurance Act 1911 provided coverage for primary care (but not specialist or hospital care) for wage earners, covering about one-third of the population. The Russian Empire established a similar system in 1912, and other industrialized countries began following suit. By the 1930s, similar systems existed in virtually all of Western and Central Europe. Japan introduced an employee health insurance law in 1927, expanding further upon it in 1935 and 1940. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, a fully public and centralized health care system was established in Soviet Russia in 1920. However, it was not a truly universal system at that point, as rural residents were not covered.

In New Zealand, a universal health care system was created in a series of steps, from 1938 to 1941. In Australia, the state of Queensland introduced a free public hospital system in 1946.

Following World War II, universal health care systems began to be set up around the world. On July 5, 1948, the United Kingdom launched its universal National Health Service. Universal health care was next introduced in the Nordic countries of Sweden (1955), Iceland (1956), Norway (1956), Denmark (1961) and Finland (1964). Universal health insurance was introduced in Japan in 1961, and in Canada through stages, starting with the province of Saskatchewan in 1962, followed by the rest of Canada from 1968 to 1972. A public healthcare system was introduced in Egypt following the Egyptian revolution of 1952. Centralized public healthcare systems were set up in the Eastern bloc countries. The Soviet Union extended universal health care to its rural residents in 1969. Kuwait and Bahrain introduced their universal healthcare systems in 1950 and 1957 respectively (prior to independence). Italy introduced its &quot;Servizio Sanitario Nazionale&quot; (National Health Service) in 1978. Universal health insurance was implemented in Australia in 1975 with the &quot;Medibank&quot;, which led to universal coverage under the current Medicare system from 1984.

From the 1970s to the 2000s, Western European countries began introducing universal coverage, most of them building upon previous health insurance programs to cover the whole population. For example, France built upon its 1928 national health insurance system, with subsequent legislation covering a larger and larger percentage of the population, until the remaining 1% of the population that was uninsured received coverage in 2000. Single payer healthcare systems were introduced in Finland (1972), Portugal (1979), Cyprus (1980), Spain (1986) and Iceland (1990). Switzerland introduced a universal healthcare system based on an insurance mandate in 1994. In addition, universal health coverage was introduced in some Asian countries, including Malaysia (1980s), South Korea (1989), Taiwan (1995), Singapore (1993), Israel (1995) and Thailand (2001).

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia retained and reformed its universal health care system, as did other now-independent former Soviet republics and Eastern bloc countries.

Beyond the 1990s, many countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, including developing countries, took steps to bring their populations under universal health coverage, including China and Brazil&#x27;s SUS which improved coverage up to 80% of the population. Taiwan implemented its system in 1995. India introduced a tax-payer funded decentralised universal healthcare system as well as comprehensive public and private health insurances that helped reduce mortality rates drastically and improved healthcare infrastructure across the country dramatically. A 2012 study examined progress being made by these countries, focusing on nine in particular: Ghana, Rwanda, Nigeria, Mali, Kenya, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Currently, most industrialized countries and many developing countries operate some form of publicly funded health care with universal coverage as the goal. According to the National Academy of Medicine and others, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide universal health care. The only forms of government-provided healthcare available are Medicare (for elderly patients above age 65 as well as people with disabilities), Medicaid (for low-income people), the Military Health System (active, reserve, and retired military personnel and dependants), and the Indian Health Service (members of federally recognized Native American tribes).

==Funding models==


Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific charge (which may be charged to the individual or an employer) or with the option of private payments (by direct or optional insurance) for services beyond those covered by the public system. Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions. Most universal health care systems are funded primarily by tax revenue (as in Portugal, India, Spain, Denmark and Sweden). Some nations, such as Germany, France, and Japan, employ a multi-payer system in which health care is funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding comes from contributions from employers and employees to regulated non-profit sickness funds. Contributions are compulsory and defined according to law. A distinction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality, specialty healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and medications are paid for by a state agency. A paper by Sherry A. Glied from Columbia University found that universal health care systems are modestly redistributive and that the progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income inequality.

===Compulsory insurance===

This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, but sometimes the government provides the insurance. Sometimes there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in the Canadian provinces). Healthcare in Switzerland is based on compulsory insurance.

In some European countries where private insurance and universal health care coexist, such as Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, the problem of adverse selection is overcome by using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus, a fund with a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receive funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage in eliminating people with higher risks because they are compensated for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but they compete mainly on price and service. In some countries, the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.

The Republic of Ireland at one time had a &quot;community rating&quot; system by VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition, but without a compensation pool. That resulted in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering much less expensive health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market, which then made higher profits at VHI&#x27;s expense. The government later reintroduced community rating by a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA, withdrew from the Irish market.

In Poland, people are obliged to pay a percentage of the average monthly wage to the state, even if they are covered by private insurance. People working under a employment contract pay a percentage of their wage, while entrepreneurs pay a fixed rate, based on the average national wage. Unemployed people are insured by the labor office.

Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single-payer systems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance or by limiting the ability of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.

===Single-payer===

Single-payer health care is a system in which the government, rather than private insurers, pays for all health care costs. Single-payer systems may contract for healthcare services from private organizations, or own and employ healthcare resources and personnel (as was the case in England before the introduction of the Health and Social Care Act). In some instances, such as Italy and Spain, both these realities may exist at the same time. &quot;Single-payer&quot; thus describes only the funding mechanism and refers to health care financed by a single public body from a single fund and does not specify the type of delivery or for whom doctors work. Although the fund holder is usually the state, some forms of single-payer use a mixed public-private system.

===Tax-based financing===
In tax-based financing, individuals contribute to the provision of health services through various taxes. These are typically pooled across the whole population unless local governments raise and retain tax revenues. Some countries (notably Spain, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Italy, Brazil, Portugal, India and the Nordic countries) choose to fund public health care directly from taxation alone. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arrangements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.

===Social health insurance===
In a social health insurance system, contributions from workers, the self-employed, enterprises and governments are pooled into single or multiple funds on a compulsory basis. This is based on risk pooling. The social health insurance model is also referred to as the Bismarck Model, after Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who introduced the first universal health care system in Germany in the 19th century. The funds typically contract with a mix of public and private providers for the provision of a specified benefit package. Preventive and public health care may be provided by these funds or responsibility kept solely by the Ministry of Health. Within social health insurance, a number of functions may be executed by parastatal or non-governmental sickness funds, or in a few cases, by private health insurance companies. Social health insurance is used in a number of Western European countries and increasingly in Eastern Europe as well as in Israel and Japan.

===Private insurance===
In private health insurance, premiums are paid directly from employers, associations, individuals and families to insurance companies, which pool risks across their membership base. Private insurance includes policies sold by commercial for-profit firms, non-profit companies and community health insurers. Generally, private insurance is voluntary in contrast to social insurance programs, which tend to be compulsory.

In some countries with universal coverage, private insurance often excludes certain health conditions that are expensive and the state health care system can provide coverage. For example, in the United Kingdom, one of the largest private health care providers is BUPA, which has a long list of general exclusions even in its highest coverage policy, most of which are routinely provided by the National Health Service. In the Netherlands, which has regulated competition for its main insurance system (but is subject to a budget cap), insurers must cover a basic package for all enrollees, but may choose which additional services they offer in supplementary plans; which most people possess .

The Planning Commission of India has also suggested that the country should embrace insurance to achieve universal health coverage. General tax revenue is currently used to meet the essential health requirements of all people.

===Community-based health insurance===
A particular form of private health insurance that has often emerged, if financial risk protection mechanisms have only a limited impact, is community-based health insurance. Individual members of a specific community pay to a collective health fund which they can draw from when they need medical care. Contributions are not risk-related and there is generally a high level of community involvement in the running of these plans. Community-based health insurance generally only play a limited role in helping countries move towards universal health coverage. Challenges includes inequitable access by the poorest that health service utilization of members generally increase after enrollment.

== Implementation and comparisons ==

Universal health care systems vary according to the degree of government involvement in providing care or health insurance. In some countries, such as Canada, the UK, Italy, Australia, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the commissioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights, not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic delivery system, based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries jointly.

Sometimes, the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums, salary-related mandatory contributions by employees or employers to regulated sickness funds, and by government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to reimburse private or public medical providers, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries, such as the Netherlands and Switzerland, operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers, which are not allowed to make a profit from the mandatory element of insurance but can profit by selling supplemental insurance.

Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal health care through legislation, regulation, and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually, some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption, but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others, tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long-term chronic care.

A critical concept in the delivery of universal healthcare is that of population healthcare. This is a way of organizing the delivery, and allocating resources, of healthcare (and potentially social care) based on populations in a given geography with a common need (such as asthma, end of life, urgent care). Rather than focus on institutions such as hospitals, primary care, community care etc. the system focuses on the population with a common as a whole. This includes people currently being treated, and those that are not being treated but should be (i.e. where there is health inequity). This approach encourages integrated care and a more effective use of resources.

The United Kingdom National Audit Office in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine universal systems against one non-universal system (the United States), and their relative costs and key health outcomes. A wider international comparison of 16 countries, each with universal health care, was published by the World Health Organization in 2004. In some cases, government involvement also includes directly managing the health care system, but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.

== Overview of Health Coverage Reports ==
The 2023 report from the WHO and the World Bank indicates that the advancement towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by the year 2030 has not progressed since 2015. The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) has remained constant at a score of 68 from 2019 to 2021. It is reported that catastrophic out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditures have impacted over 1 billion individuals globally. Additionally, in the year 2019, it was found that 2 billion people experienced financial difficulties due to health expenses, with ongoing, significant disparities in coverage. The report suggests several strategies to mitigate these challenges: it calls for the acceleration of essential health services, sustained attention to infectious disease management, improvement in health workforce and infrastructure, the elimination of financial barriers to care, an increase in pre-paid and pooled health financing, policy initiatives to curtail OOP expenses, a focus on primary healthcare to reinforce overall health systems, and the fortification of collaborative efforts to achieve UHC. These measures aim to increase health service coverage by an additional 477 million individuals by the year 2023 and to continue progress towards covering an extra billion people by the 2030 deadline.

==Criticism and support==
Critics of universal healthcare claim that it leads to longer wait times and a decrease in the quality of healthcare. They claim that quality is lower due to budget constraints and overburdened medical staff. For example, many patients in Canada may go to the United States for medical care due to the long wait times. Some believe that government-run healthcare systems are less efficient than private ones, leading to potential waste and mismanagement. Other critics point out the potential of overuse and abuse leading to insolvency. Relatedly, some also argue that universal health care can be extremely expensive for governments to maintain, leading to higher taxes and potential strain on public finances, such as those in the Nordic countries, Australia, and New Zealand. For countries that do not currently have universal healthcare like the United States, they argue it would raise healthcare expenditures due to the high cost of implementation that the United States government supposedly cannot afford. 

However, most of the resistance to universal healthcare in the United States is rooted in ideology. For example, critics of implementing universal healthcare in the United States claim that it would require healthy people to pay for the medical care of unhealthy people, which goes against the American values of personal responsibility. Also, they argue it represents unnecessary government overreach into the lives of American citizens and employers as it denies them individual choice. In other words, it may limit the choices available to patients, as the government may control which treatments and medications are covered. Lastly, it would unfairly limit the healthcare and health insurance industry.

According to a 2020 study published in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, the proposed Medicare for All Act would save 68,000 lives and $450 billion in national healthcare expenditure annually. A 2022 study published in the &quot;PNAS&quot; found that a single-payer universal healthcare system would have saved 212,000 lives and averted over $100 billion in medical costs during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in 2020 alone. Given the high prevalence of uninsured and under-insured people in the United States, if implemented, universal health care would increase health care access for more than 25 million Americans.
