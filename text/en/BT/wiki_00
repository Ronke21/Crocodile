<text>St. Lawrence University is a private liberal arts college in the village of Canton in St. Lawrence County, New York. It has roughly 2,100 undergraduate and 100 graduate students.

Though St. Lawrence today is nonsectarian, it was founded in 1856 by leaders of the Universalist Church, who were seeking to establish a seminary west of New England and were enthusiastically courted by the citizens of Canton. The church almost did not place the school in Canton, however, as they felt students might be exposed to too much &quot;excitement&quot; within the village limits in 1856. The denomination, which has since merged with the Unitarian faith, was part of the liberal wing of Protestantism, championing such ideas as critical thinking and sex equality — attributes that surfaced in the new Theological School of St. Lawrence University, which was progressive in its teaching philosophy and coeducational from the beginning.

==History==
The university as it exists today was created as a &quot;Preparatory Department&quot; to provide a foundation for theological study. That department became today&#x27;s liberal arts university, while the seminary closed in 1965 with the Unitarian/Universalist consolidation.

Early in the 20th century, the university&#x27;s graduate program in education came into being; it has since served hundreds of North Country school teachers and administrators. Following a difficult period during the Great Depression and World War II that included the decision to shut down the Brooklyn Law School, the student population increased quickly, and with it, the physical plant. A four-building campus serving around 300 students in the early 1940s, became a 30-building campus serving 2000 students within 25 years, partly through acquisition of the adjacent state school of agriculture campus when that facility relocated across town. The mid-1960s, also saw the birth of one of St. Lawrence&#x27;s nationally known programs: its international programs. In 1974, two early campus buildings, Richardson Hall (1855–56), and Herring-Cole Hall (1869–1902), were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1984, structures built before 1930 were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Lawrence University-Old Campus Historic District.

During World War II, St. Lawrence University was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

In the 2000s, the university undertook several construction projects. The Newell Field House was completed in 2001. The campus student center was completed in the spring of 2004, and serves as the school&#x27;s hub at the center of campus. The Johnson Hall of Science opened in the fall of 2007, and expanded learning and lab space in several science disciplines, notably biology, chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience, and psychology. Johnson Hall received LEED Gold certification for its sustainable design; it was the first Gold science building in New York State. Additionally, the Noble Center underwent major renovations to double the space available for the arts. A new Center for Arts Technology opened in January 2007. In 2020, the university completed an extensive renovation of the Appleton Arena.

==Undergraduate admissions==
In 2024, St. Lawrence accepted 63.5% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered very high, applicant competition considered average, and with those admitted having an average 3.6 high school GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores, St. Lawrence being a test optional school. Those accepted that submitted test scores had an average 1330 SAT score (19% submitting scores) or average 30 ACT score (5% submitting scores).

For the class of 2022 (enrolled fall 2018), St. Lawrence received 6,458 applications and accepted 2,975 (46.1%). The number enrolling was 643; the yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) was 21.6%. In terms of class rank, 36% of enrolled freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school classes; 73% ranked in the top quarter. The average GPA for entering freshmen was 3.55, the average SAT score was 1260, and the average ACT score was 28.

The class of 2018 (enrolled fall 2014) included 34.2% from New York State, 56.2% from 31 other states, and 9% international students representing 63 countries. Of the 643 matriculants in 2018, 52% were female, 48% were male.

In the U.S., students can study at The Washington Center in Washington, D.C., in New York City, in the Adirondack State Park, or at Fisk University, a distinguished, historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee.
==Libraries==

The Owen D. Young Library (ODY) is a multilevel building. A six-million-dollar renovation of the library was recently completed. It includes more than 500,000 volumes, over 370,000 government documents, 1986 periodicals, 550,000 micro text units, recipient of 10,000 to 20,000 reports and documents annually and access to over 70 databases through Internet.

In addition to ODY, which houses the college&#x27;s major collections in the social sciences and humanities, the J. Harold and Ruth C. Launders Science Library opened in January 1994. Home of the major science and technology collections at St. Lawrence, the Launders Science Library occupies the upper two floors of Madill Hall, and triples the space available for science resources and services.

The library&#x27;s collection of primary scholarly resources may be viewed and used in the Frank and Anne Piskor Special Collections Reading Room, located directly across the atrium from the main entrance of ODY. Each semester the special collections staff offer instruction to classes from a variety of academic departments and programs, including fine arts, French, English, history, environmental studies, economics and the outdoor studies program. In addition, the special collections program includes a book arts collection and a laboratory press. Highlights of St. Lawrence&#x27;s special collections include the William Rose Benet Collection of American Poetry, the Milburn Collection of Hawthorniana, the Edwin Arlington Robinson Collection, and the Frank P. Piskor Collection on Robert Frost. Other special collections include manuscripts devoted to Frederic Remington, the Adirondacks, the St. Lawrence Seaway and other aspects of northern New York history.

===Arts and cultural offerings===

The opportunities described below are augmented by frequent concerts, exhibits, performances and shows provided by outside performers.

====Music====

The music department supports three vocal and two instrumental ensembles. Laurentian Singers, an undergraduate chorus that tours each spring, University Chorus and the Early Music Singers provide vocal opportunities for St. Lawrence students. Instrumentalists may choose between participation in the String Orchestra, Concert Band, Improv Lab, Early Music Ensemble and Special Productions. The Early Music Ensemble uses the Emily Romer Collection of medieval and Renaissance instruments to perform music of the 12th through 18th centuries. Each semester the department offers a Special Production, focusing on a particular repertory. Recent productions have included a Latin Dance Party, Music for Louis XIV and Traditional Irish Music. Private instruction is available in voice and on keyboard, guitar, brass, woodwinds and strings. Three informal student-directed collegiate a cappella groups, The Saints, The Sinners, and The Upbeats are active both on and off campus. Most students that participate in the Music Ensembles are not Music Majors, but rather have a strong interest in pursuing their musical capabilities.

St. Lawrence University is also home to the Java Barn, an on-campus music venue run by a dedicated group of SLU students. The Java Barn hosts live bands every weekend; shows are open to all SLU students and admission is free.

====Theatre====

The Performance and Communication Arts (PCA) department stages annual faculty-directed productions in Gulick Theater, a proscenium theater seating 511. In addition, the flexible 85- to 100-seat Edison Miles Theater (better known as the Black Box) is used for experimental and student productions. Guest artist workshops that address all aspects of theater are offered for interested students. Though some production work is associated with classes, for many productions it is not necessary to be a major, or even currently enrolled in (PCA) classes, to participate.

====Art====

The university art collection contains nearly 7,000 objects that are frequently displayed in the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery or used for tours and classroom discussions. While the collection dates to the university&#x27;s founding, its most vital growth has taken place in recent years. Twentieth-century works on paper, such as photographs, prints, drawings and portfolios, are the strength of the collection. Paintings and sculptures by Frank Stella, George Segal, Louise Nevelson, Isamu Noguchi, Milton Avery and Frederic Remington are among the collection&#x27;s highlights.

===Activities===

St. Lawrence hosts more than 100 student activities groups. St. Lawrence is home to the second oldest collegiate outing club in the nation (next to only Dartmouth College). The club annually sends students to climb all 46 peaks over of the Adirondacks during &quot;Peak Weekend&quot;. Peak Weekend has recently celebrated its 25th anniversary at St. Lawrence. The Outing Club also has its own residence on campus and is part of the Theme Cottages. The club frequently sponsors trips for skiing, hiking, rafting and other outdoor activities.

Established in 1993 as a student-run coffeehouse, the Java Barn is a well-known venue among touring bands on the East Coast. In 2006 the music venue moved to the former Winning Health Center. In the fall of 2010, Java was moved once again to an area between The Student Center and Admissions Building. Java now occupies a former storage garage, with bright student-created murals spattering the walls.

The Student Government is also very active on campus. The Thelomathesian Society was founded in 1863 by Vasco P. Abbott who became its first President. The Thelomathesian Society, or Thelmo as it is often called, serves as the governing body of the St. Lawrence University Student Body, and is a forum for students to voice their opinions on issues presented by the Administration, Faculty, and Student Body. Thelmo debates and votes on a wide variety of issues, ranging from university policies to St. Lawrence University Student Activities Funding (SLUSAF) requests for different campus groups and organizations.

Theme Cottages are a popular housing option at St. Lawrence. The Women&#x27;s Resource Center was founded to raise awareness of gender issues on and off campus. WRC members, or &quot;Dub Girls&quot;, are trained as sexual assault victim advocates and create education programs to promote safe sexual practices. The Black Student Union and La Casa Latina houses both celebrate racial diversity by exemplifying racially diverse living. The Artists&#x27; Guild is a house that focuses on supporting and appreciating the visual arts. Commons College residents focus on charity fund-raising and building a living-learning experience through a house-shared course each semester. The H.O.P.E. (Helping Out People Everywhere) house focuses on community service, as the name suggests. The Java House is the living space for the students who run the campus&#x27;s concert venue, the Java Barn. The L.I.G.H.T. (Living Inspirationally Growing Healthy Together) House is a theme house where students work to promote a healthy lifestyle centered on balance and self-awareness. The Outing Club House provides a living space for those who are highly involved in the campus&#x27;s historic Outing Club. The Arts Annex is a space for students who strive for appreciation and support of the arts. Students living in the Arts Annex are members of the St. Lawrence University Performing Arts Collaborative (SLUPAC), and also work closely with TAUNY (Traditional Arts in Upstate New York), a non-profit organization dedicated to documenting, preserving and promoting the traditional folk arts and folklore of New York&#x27;s North Country. Together, TAUNY and the students of the Arts Annex/SLUPAC work to help sustain a variety of arts throughout the North Country. The Campus Kitchens house is a space allotted for students who partake in St. Lawrence&#x27;s chapter of the national organization, The Campus Kitchens Project. Students of Campus Kitchens work to cook hot meals for disadvantaged community members by utilizing donated food, by repurposing leftover campus food, and by using food grown on campus itself. The group also packs bagged lunches, which they call &quot;Bear Packs,&quot; for disadvantaged Canton schoolchildren. The Greenhouse is home to many environmentally conscious students. Students in the Greenhouse live in an environmentally responsible manner, and provide weekly, healthy, locally sourced dinners. The Habitat for Humanity theme cottage houses students that actively work with the local chapter and national office of Habitat for Humanity. There is also a technology-centric theme house, The Hub, which provides gaming and technology events to the campus.

The Greek System now consists of four sororities and two fraternity chapters. In 1997 the school had five sororities and seven fraternities. The current state of Greek participation levels are substantially lower than in past years, due in part to liability issues and national chapter concerns over various alcohol and code violations. However the remaining chapters still have an active role in campus life.

===Residential life===
St. Lawrence is a four-year residential university; the residential experience is integral to the educational process. Students are required to live in university residence halls, theme cottages or Greek chapter houses during each semester at the university. Each residential area has a residential coordinator (RC) who provide supervision, leadership and support for the residents in their units and perform administrative duties pertaining to their buildings. Community assistants (CA) are undergraduate students who assist RCs.

====The First-Year Program (FYP)====

A unique requirement of St. Lawrence&#x27;s curriculum is the First Year Program. St. Lawrence&#x27;s first-Year Program is one of the oldest living-learning programs in the country, helping students make successful transitions from high school to college, intellectually and socially, since 1987. Students live together and study in a team-taught FYP, developing the writing, speaking, and research skills needed for college. They continue to develop these skills in a spring First-Year Seminar. All first-year students live in residential colleges of the FYP. These are buildings or wings of buildings where approximately 30 students live together and enroll in a common course. A professional RC and upperclass CAs provide supervision.

====Upperclass Residential Program====

All upperclass students live in one of four housing options: residence halls, cottages, Greek chapter houses, or the senior townhouses. The majority of upperclass students live in residence halls, where most floors are coeducational. Singles, doubles, triples and quads are available and there are suites in a two-building complex. Room assignments are made on a class year priority. Theme suites and cottages are available for groups with special common interests. Groups must apply in the spring semester for the following year.

==Athletics==

<doc id="561697" wikidata="Q3822355" url="?curid=561697" title="The Iron Dragon's Daughter">
<text>The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter is a 1993 science fantasy novel by American writer Michael Swanwick. The story follows Jane, a changeling girl who slaves at a dragon factory in the world of Faerie, building part-magical, part-cybernetic monsters that are used as jet fighters. The plot of her story takes the form of a spiral, with events and characters constantly recurring in new settings.

The novel constantly subverts fantasy tropes and archetypes. Swanwick admits having written it both as a homage to J. R. R. Tolkien and in reaction to a handful of writers he claims exploit Tolkien&#x27;s milieu and the readers&#x27; imaginations with derivative, commercial fantasy:

The dragon Melanchthon is named after German theologian Philipp Melanchthon, an associate of Martin Luther. Further references to Lutheranism can be found in Swanwick&#x27;s novel &quot;Jack Faust&quot;.

Swanwick has written two other books in the same setting, entitled &quot;The Dragons of Babel&quot; (published in 2008) and &quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Mother&quot; (published in 2019). Excerpts from &quot;The Dragons of Babel&quot; have periodically been published as short stories. They include &quot;King Dragon&quot;, &quot;The Word that Sings the Scythe&quot;, &quot;An Episode of Stardust&quot;, &quot;A Small Room in Koboldtown&quot; and &quot;Lord Weary&#x27;s Empire&quot;. Most of these were originally published in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
The first portion of the story concerns Jane&#x27;s childhood in a factory that builds iron dragons. Jane and her close friend Rooster, whose true name is Tetigistus, work in a group of indentured child laborers. Jane steals a grimoire, and after reading it, begins to hear the voice of an iron dragon in her head. Jane is taken to entertain an elderly, silent elf called the Baldwynn, but is told not to return after she witnesses a strange phenomenon. The dragon manipulates Rooster into trying to escape, but Rooster dies in the attempt. A distraught Jane forces the dragon to tell her his true name, Melanchthon. They then flee the factory.

Later, Jane attends high school while fixing a dormant Melanchthon, who was damaged in their escape. She discovers that the school principal is none other than the Baldwynn and becomes friends with her classmate Peter and his girlfriend Gwen, who, as the wicker queen, will soon be burned alive as a sacrifice to the Goddess. To Jane&#x27;s shock, Peter tells her that his true name is Tetigistus. They confess their love and sleep together. Soon after, Gwen is sacrificed and Peter commits suicide out of guilt. Melanchthon disappears and Jane realizes that his manipulation caused these events.

Next, Jane goes to college to study alchemy. She makes new friends: Sirin, a talented alchemist, and Puck Aleshire, to whom she is strangely drawn. Jane discovers that Puck has the same soul as Peter and Rooster did: Tetigistus. She also suspects that Sirin might have the same soul as Gwen. Soon after, the Teind arrives, a night of chaos during which both Sirin and Puck die. Jane reunites with Melanchthon, who shows her that her life constantly spirals around to the same failures and reveals his ultimate plan to destroy the universe. Feeling her existence is futile, Jane agrees to help him.

Jane becomes a minor celebrity and serial killer, using the bodies of her victims as fuel for Melanchthon. She meets a dragon pilot named Rocket, who she realizes is another Tetigistus, and his half-sister Fata Incolore, true name Kunosoura, who shares a soul with Sirin and Gwen. Jane also encounters the Baldwynn, who shows her that her body in the human world is confined to a mental institution. After Jane sleeps with Rocket, she and Melanchthon enact their plan to destroy the universe. Rocket pursues them in his own dragon, and Jane is forced to blast him away, killing Tetigistus yet again. As they approach Spiral Castle, the center of the universe, Melanchthon dissolves around Jane and she realizes that their plan was doomed from the start.

Jane finds herself in Spiral Castle with the Baldwynn, who reveals that he&#x27;s one of the Goddess&#x27;s consorts and takes Jane to see her. The Goddess berates Jane for squandering the gift of her connection with Tetigistus and Kunosoura through her selfishness, causing Jane to have an existential crisis.

Afterwards, Jane is returned to the mortal world, unsure of whether or not she is being punished. She is released from the mental institution and goes on to obtain a doctorate in chemistry. While attending a party with a friend, Jane glimpses a man to whom she is instantly and desperately drawn. The novel ends, leaving it uncertain if Jane has finally reunited with Tetigistus and found a chance at redemption.

== Tone ==
Much of the novel is nihilistic in tone. Jane encounters Tetigistus and Kunosoura several times, and each time prioritizes her own survival, resulting in their deaths. She also fails to remain a moral protagonist, becoming a manipulative thief who is willing to kill to accomplish her goals. Melanchthon embodies nihilism and atheism, telling Jane that the Goddess is a myth and that the world comes to nothing:Life exists, and all who live are born to suffer. The best moments are fleeting and bought with the coin of exquisite torment. All attachments end. All loved ones die. All that you value passes away. In such a vexatious existence laughter is madness and joy is folly. Shall we accept that it all happens for no reason, with no cause? That there is nobody to blame but ourselves but that accepting the responsibility is pointless for doing so cannot ease, defer, or deaden the pain? Not likely! It is so much more comforting to erect a straw figure on which to blame it all.However, the novel ends on a cautiously optimistic note. Jane&#x27;s encounter with the Goddess reveals that, in truth, there is order to the universe and that, though she squandered it, Jane did have a destiny. She refuses to answer Jane&#x27;s questions on why the world is painful, whether choice is an illusion, and what the Goddess wants. Despite this, Jane comes to realize the Goddess&#x27;s love for her and that her life in the human world &quot;[is] not punishment.&quot; The final suggestion that Jane may be reunited with Tetigistus suggests that the Goddess has forgiven Jane and given her another chance to fulfill her purpose.

== Themes ==
Blood sacrifice is a constant presence in &quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Two prominent examples are the sacrifice of the wicker queen, who is burned alive on Samhain, and the Teind, which claims one tenth of the students at Jane&#x27;s university. It is never made clear whether or not these traditions are necessary to appease the Goddess. Other instances include the bodies of men being sacrificed to Melanchthon&#x27;s hunger and the repeated sacrifice of Tetigistus&#x27;s life in service of Jane&#x27;s goals.

Materialism and consumerism also pervade the novel. The Faerie world is populated with familiar structures, including malls, from which Jane learns to shoplift. Throughout the novel, common material items are juxtaposed with mythological beings. As the wicker queen, Gwen becomes a celebrity, indulging in drugs and a lavish lifestyle before her death is broadcast as a live TV special. Jane observes a society of minuscule, ant-like creatures called meryons gradually grow from an agricultural bliss to a dystopia where the rich are protected and &quot;tiny enemies of the state&quot; are executed. When characters are injured or dreaming, they often spout off phrases that seem pulled from an advertisement. For example, when Rooster is in a coma during the opening of the novel: Rooster groaned In a high, lucid voice, he said &quot;Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese...&quot; Jane found herself unable to breathe. &quot;... and a sesame seed bun.&quot; It was too awful, his lonely voice speaking to no one in the emptiness of the night. &quot;Teflon.&quot;Finally, virginity and the lack thereof are often addressed. Virginity seems required for many functions in the Faerie world. While Jane can pilot Melanchthon after she has lost her virginity, she cannot repair him, as the touch of a non-virgin will burn his wiring. Though the wicker queen need not remain a virgin, her consort is required to do so. When Peter and Jane have sex, he is rendered unable to perform his part of the sacrifice and must be replaced, to his shame. However, sex and sexuality also hold great power in &quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter.&quot; While at university, Jane learns to use esoteric sex rituals for magical and alchemical purposes. Through these rituals, she is able to make a variety of discoveries and speak to her human mother in visions. Jane also uses her sexuality as a source of power in interpersonal relationships.

==Author&#x27;s comments==
In a 2017 interview, Swanwick said,
== Reception ==
&quot;The Iron Dragon&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was lauded for its upheaval of fantasy tropes and its inventive style and narrative. Critic John Clute called the book an &quot;anti-fantasy&quot; and Kirkus described it as &quot;seething, brain-bursting, all but indescribable.&quot; The novel was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, Locus Award, and World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1994.
The &quot;New York Times&quot; named it a Notable Book in 1994.

<text>Raid on Bungeling Bay (バンゲリングベイ lit.: Bungeling Bay) is a shoot &#x27;em up video game developed by Will Wright and published by Broderbund for the Commodore 64 in 1984. It was the first video game designed by Will Wright. The Commodore 64 version was published in the UK by Ariolasoft. The game inspired Wright to develop &quot;SimCity&quot; in 1989.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; is a 2D shoot &#x27;em up. The player controls a helicopter launched from an aircraft carrier to bomb six factories scattered across islands on a small planetoid occupied by the Bungeling Empire (frequent villains in Broderbund games), while fending off escalating counterattacks by gun turrets, fighter jets, guided missiles, and a battleship. There is also a hidden island for the player to reload on. Failure means that the Bungeling Empire develops a war machine to take over the planet Earth. Players have to attack its infrastructure while defending the aircraft carrier which serves as home base.

The game offers an insight into the design style of Wright, who also designed &quot;SimCity&quot;. Over time, the factories grow and develop new technologies to use against the player. There are also visible signs of interdependency among the islands, such as supply boats moving between them. In order to win the game, the player must prevent the escalation by bombing all the factories as quickly as possible, keeping them from advancing their technology. If left alone for too long, the factories create enough new weaponry to overwhelm the player.

==Ports==
&quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; was ported to the Famicom/NES by Hudson Soft, who published this version and released it in Japan on February 22, 1985. A conversion for the arcade-based VS. System was created based on this port, and it was distributed to arcades in Japan by Nintendo. Although a United States release was planned for the Summer of 1985, Will Wright stated in an interview that he was not sure if it actually did get released. An MSX version was developed by Zap and published by Sony. The Japanese releases of the game are alternatively titled .

==Reception==
&quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; for the Commodore 64 sold about 20,000 to 30,000 units in America, while the NES version sold about a million units in Japan. Will Wright attributed this large discrepancy to the lack of software piracy on the NES due to its cartridge system, along with &quot;Raid&quot; being one of the first American games published in Japan. Sales of the game gave Wright the financial freedom to create SimCity.

&quot;Compute!&quot; wrote in 1985 that &quot;Raid&quot; &quot;possesses all the virtues needed to appease the demanding gamer&quot;, with &quot;amazingly detailed&quot; graphics. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1988 approved of the Nintendo version&#x27;s graphics, calling it a &quot;high adventure with realistic overtones&quot; that did not involve dragons or elves. The magazine named it the Action-Strategy Game of the Year for Nintendo, writing that &quot;Raid&quot; had been &quot;rescued from Broderbund&#x27;s computer software vaults, updated slightly, and sent out to challenge all the bright new [Nintendo games and] blew them out of the water ... a delightful game experience&quot;. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Raid on Bungeling Bay&quot; the 24th-best computer game ever released.

==Legacy==
Wright continued to develop the editor for the game as a personal toy because he enjoyed it so much. He researched urban planning and realised that others might enjoy constructing and building cities themselves. The result was a more advanced simulation that eventually became &quot;SimCity&quot;.

<text>The jungle prinia (Prinia sylvatica) is a small passerine bird, a warbler in the family Cisticolidae.

==Distribution and habitat==
This prinia is a resident breeder in Bangladesh and India, far south-western Nepal, and Sri Lanka, typically found in dry open grassland, open woodland, scrub and sometimes gardens.

==Description==

These long warblers have short rounded wings, a longish tail, strong legs and a short black bill. In breeding plumage, adults are grey-brown above, with a short white supercilium and warmer brown rump. There are rufous fringes on the closed wings and white edges to the tail. Underparts are whitish-buff. The sexes are identical except that the male has a blacker bill and mouth in the breeding season.

In winter, the upperparts are a warmer brown, and the underparts more buff. The tail is longer than in summer. There are a four races differing in plumage shade. The distinctive endemic race in Sri Lanka, &quot; P. s.valida&quot;, retains summer plumage, including the shorter tail, all year round, and lacks the supercilium and white in the tail.

==Behaviour==
Like most warblers, the jungle prinia is insectivorous. It builds its nest in a shrub or tall grass and lays 3–5 eggs. The song is a repetitive &quot;pit-pretty, pit-pretty, pit-pretty&quot;.

<text>The Armstrong Whitworth A.W.38 Whitley was a British medium/heavy bomber aircraft of the 1930s. It was one of three twin-engined, front line medium bomber types that were in service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) at the outbreak of the Second World War. Alongside the Vickers Wellington and the Handley Page Hampden, the Whitley was developed during the mid-1930s according to Air Ministry Specification B.3/34, which it was subsequently selected to meet. In 1937, the Whitley formally entered into RAF squadron service; it was the first of the three medium bombers to be introduced.

Following the outbreak of war in September 1939, the Whitley participated in the first RAF bombing raid upon German territory and remained an integral part of the early British bomber offensive. In 1942 it was superseded as a bomber by the larger four-engined &quot;heavies&quot; such as the Avro Lancaster. Its front-line service included maritime reconnaissance with Coastal Command and the second line roles of glider-tug, trainer and transport aircraft. The type was also procured by British Overseas Airways Corporation as a civilian freighter aircraft. The aircraft was named after Whitley, a suburb of Coventry, home of Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s Whitley plant.

==Development==

===Origins===

In July 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification B.3/34, seeking a heavy night bomber/troop transport to replace the Handley Page Heyford biplane bomber. This combination bomber/transport was part of the RAF&#x27;s concept of fighting wars in distant British Empire locations, where the aircraft would fly into the theatre of action carrying troops and then provide air support.

John Lloyd, the Chief Designer of Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft, chose to respond to the specification with the &quot;AW.38&quot; design, which later was given the name &quot;Whitley&quot; after the location of Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s main factory. The design of the AW.38 was a development of the Armstrong Whitworth AW.23 bomber-transport design that had lost to the Bristol Bombay for the earlier Specification C.26/31.

Lloyd selected the Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engine to power the Whitley, which was capable of generating . One of the novel features of the Whitley&#x27;s design was the adoption of a three-bladed two-position variable-pitch propeller built by de Havilland; the Whitley was the first aircraft to fly with such an arrangement.

As Lloyd was unfamiliar with the use of flaps on a large heavy monoplane, they were initially omitted from the design. To compensate, the mid-set wings were set at a high angle of incidence (8.5°) to confer good take-off and landing performance. Flaps were included late in the design stage, but the wing incidence remained unaltered; as a result, the Whitley flew with a pronounced nose-down attitude when at cruising speed, resulting in considerable drag.

The Whitley holds the distinction of having been the first RAF aircraft with a semi-monocoque structure in its fuselage, which was built slab-sided to ease production. This replaced the tubular construction method traditionally employed by Armstrong Whitworth, who instead constructed the airframe from light-alloy rolled sections, pressings and corrugated sheets. According to aviation author Philip Moyes, the decision to adopt the semi-monocoque fuselage was a significant advance in design; many Whitleys surviving severe damage on operations.

In June 1935, owing to the urgent need to replace biplane heavy bombers then in service with the RAF, it was agreed to produce an initial 80 aircraft, 40 being of an early &quot;Whitley Mk I&quot; standard and the other 40 being more advanced &quot;Whitley Mk IIs&quot;. Production was initially at three factories in Coventry; fuselages and detailed components were fabricated at Whitley Abbey, panel-beating and much of the detailed work at the former Coventry Ordnance Works factory, while wing fabrication and final assembly took place at Baginton Aerodrome. During 1935 and 1936, various contracts were placed for the type; the Whitley was ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot; - prior to the first flights of any of the prototypes.

On 17 March 1936, the first prototype Whitley Mk I, &quot;K4586&quot;, conducted its maiden flight from Baginton Aerodrome, piloted by Armstrong Whitworth Chief Test Pilot Alan Campbell-Orde. &quot;K4586&quot; was powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX 14-cylinder air-cooled aircraft radial engines. The second prototype, &quot;K4587&quot;, was furnished with a pair of more powerful medium-supercharged Tiger XI engines. The prototypes differed little from the initial production standard aircraft; a total of 34 production Whitley Mk I were completed.

===Further development===
After the first 34 aircraft had been completed, the engines were replaced with the more reliable two-speed-supercharged Tiger VIIIs. &quot;K7243&quot;, the 27th production Whitley, is believed to have served as a prototype following modifications. The resulting aircraft was designated as the Whitley Mk II. A total of 46 production aircraft were completed to the Whitley Mk II standard. One Whitley Mk II, &quot;K7243&quot;, was used as a test bed for the 21-cylinder radial Armstrong Siddeley Deerhound engine; on 6 January 1939, &quot;K7243&quot; made its first flight with the Deerhound. Another Whitley Mk I, &quot;K7208&quot;, was modified to operate with a higher () gross weight.

&quot;K7211&quot;, the 29th production Whitley, served as the prototype for a further advanced variant of the aircraft, the &quot;Whitley Mk III&quot;. The Whitley Mk III featured numerous improvements, such as the replacement of the manually operated nose turret with a single powered Nash &amp; Thompson turret and a powered retractable twin-gun ventral &quot;dustbin&quot; turret. The ventral turret was hydraulically-powered but proved to be hard to operate and added considerable drag, thus the Whitley Mk III was the only variant with it. Other changes included increased dihedral of the outer wing panels, superior navigational provision and the installation of new bomb racks. A total of 80 Whitley Mk III aircraft were manufactured.

While the Tiger VIII engine used in the Whitley Mks II and III was more reliable than those used in early aircraft, the Whitley was re-engined with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines in 1938, giving rise to the &quot;Whitley Mk IV&quot;. Three Whitley Mk I aircraft, &quot;K7208&quot;, &quot;K7209&quot; and &quot;K7211&quot;, were initially re-engined to serve as prototypes. The new engines are credited with producing greatly improved performance. Other changes made included the replacement of the manually operated tail and retractable ventral turrets with a Nash &amp; Thompson powered tail turret equipped with four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, the increasing of fuel tankage capacity, including two additional fuel tanks in the wing. A total of 40 Whitley Mk IV and Whitley Mk IVA, a sub-variant featuring more powerful models of the Merlin engine, were completed.

The decision was made to introduce a series of other minor improvements to produce the &quot;Whitley Mk V&quot;. These included the modification of the tail fins and rudders, the fitting of leading edge de-icers, further fuel capacity increases, a smaller D/F loop in a streamlined fairing being adopted, and the extension of the rear fuselage by 15 in (381 mm) to improve the rear-gunner&#x27;s field of fire. The Whitley Mk V was by far the most numerous version of the aircraft, with 1,466 built until production ended in June 1943.

The &quot;Whitley Mk VII&quot; was the final variant to be built. Unlike the other variants, it was developed for service with RAF Coastal Command and was thus furnished for maritime reconnaissance rather than as a general purpose bomber. A Whitley Mk V, &quot;P3949&quot; acted as a prototype for this variant. A total of 146 Whitley Mk VIIs were produced, additional Whitley Mk V aircraft being converted to the standard. It had a sixth crew member to operate the new ASV Mk II radar system along with an increased fuel capacity for long endurance anti-shipping missions. Some Whitley Mk VII were later converted as trainer aircraft, featuring additional seating and instrumentation for flight engineers.

Early marks of the Whitley featured bomb bay doors, fitted on the fuselage and wing bays, that were held shut by bungee cords; during bombing operations, these were opened by the weight of the bombs as they fell on them and closed again by the bungee cord. The short and unpredictable delay for the doors to open led to highly inaccurate bombing. The Mk.III introduced hydraulic doors which greatly improved bombing accuracy. To aim bombs, the bomb aimer opened a hatch in the nose of the aircraft, which extended the bomb sight out of the fuselage but the Mk IV replaced this hatch with a slightly extended transparent plexiglas panel, improving crew comfort.

==Design==

The Armstrong Whitworth Whitley was a twin-engined heavy bomber, initially being powered by a pair of . Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engines. More advanced models of the Tiger engine equipped some of the later variants of the Whitley; starting with the Whitley Mk IV variant, the Tigers were replaced by a pair of Rolls-Royce Merlin IV V12 engines. According to Moyes, the adoption of the Merlin engine gave the Whitley a considerable boost in performance.

The Whitley had a crew of five: a pilot, co-pilot/navigator, a bomb aimer, a wireless operator and a rear gunner. The pilot and second pilot/navigator sat side by side in the cockpit, with the wireless operator further back. The navigator, his seat mounted on rails and able to pivot, slid backwards and rotated to the left to use the chart table behind him after take-off. The bomb aimer position was in the nose with a gun turret located directly above. The fuselage aft of the wireless operator was divided horizontally by the bomb bay; behind the bomb bay was the main entrance and aft of that the rear turret. The bombs were stowed in two bomb bays housed within the fuselage, along with a further 14 smaller cells in the wing. Other sources state there were 16 &quot;cells&quot;, two groups of two in the fuselage and four groups of three in the wings, plus two smaller cells for parachute flares in the rear fuselage. Bomb racks capable of holding larger bombs were installed on the Whitley Mk III variant.

The early examples had a nose turret and rear turret, both being manually operated with one Vickers 0.303 machine gun apiece. On the Whitley Mk III this arrangement was substantially revised: a new retractable ventral &#x27;dustbin&#x27; position was installed mounting twin .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine-guns and the nose turret was also upgraded to a Nash &amp; Thompson power-operated turret. On the Whitley Mk IV, the tail and ventral turrets were replaced with a Nash &amp; Thompson power-operated tail turret mounting four Browning .303 machine guns; upon the adoption of this turret arrangement, the Whitley became the most powerfully armed bomber in the world against attacks from the rear.
The fuselage comprised three sections, with the main frames being riveted with the skin and the intermediate sections being riveted to the inside flanges of the longitudinal stringers. Extensive use of Alclad sheeting was made. Fuel was carried in three tanks, a pair of tanks in the leading edge of each outer wing and one tank in the roof of the fuselage, over the spar center section; two auxiliary fuel tanks could be installed in the front fuselage bomb bay compartment. The inner leading edges contained the oil tanks, which doubled as radiant oil coolers. To ease production, a deliberate effort was made to reduce component count and standardise parts. The fuselage proved to be robust enough to withstand severe damage.

The Whitley featured a large rectangular-shaped wing; its appearance led to the aircraft receiving the nickname &quot;the flying barn door&quot;. Like the fuselage, the wings were formed from three sections, being built up around a large box spar with the leading and trailing edges being fixed onto the spar at each rib point. The forward surfaces of the wings were composed of flush-riveted, smooth and unstressed metal sheeting; the rear 2/3rds aft of the box spar to the trailing edge, as well as the ailerons and split flaps was fabric covered. The inner structure of the split flaps was composed of duralumin and ran between the ailerons and the fuselage, being set at a 15–20 degree position for taking off and at a 60 degree position during landing. The tailplanes employed a similar construction to that of the wings, the fins being braced to the fuselage using metal struts; the elevators and rudders incorporated servo-balancing trim tabs.

==Operational history==

===Military service===

On 9 March 1937, the Whitley Mk I began entering squadron service with No. 10 Squadron of the RAF, replacing their Handley Page Heyford biplanes. In January 1938, the Whitley Mk II first entered squadron service with No. 58 Squadron and in August 1938, the Whitley Mk III first entered service with No. 51 Squadron. In May 1939, the Whitley Mk IV first entered service with No. 10 Squadron and in August 1939, the Whitley Mk IVA first entered service with No. 78 Squadron. By the outbreak of the Second World War, seven squadrons were operational, the majority of these flying Whitley III or IV aircraft, while the Whitley V had only just been introduced to service; 196 Whitleys were on charge with the RAF.

At the start of the war, 4 Group, equipped with the Whitley, was the only trained night bomber force in the world. Alongside the Handley Page Hampden and the Vickers Wellington, the Whitley bore the brunt of the early fighting and saw action during the first night of the war, when they dropped propaganda leaflets over Germany. The propaganda flight made the Whitley the first aircraft of RAF Bomber Command to penetrate into Germany. Further propaganda flights would travel as far as Berlin, Prague, and Warsaw. On the night of 19/20 March 1940, in conjunction with Hampdens, the Whitley conducted the first bombing raid on German soil, attacking the Hörnum seaplane base on the Island of Sylt. Following the Hörnum raid, Whitleys routinely patrolled the Frisian Islands, targeting shipping and seaplane activity.
Unlike the Hampden and Wellington, which had met Specification B.9/32 for a day bomber, the Whitley was always intended for night operations and escaped the early heavy losses received during daylight raids carried out upon German shipping. As the oldest of the three bombers, the Whitley was obsolete by the start of the war, yet over 1,000 more aircraft were produced before a suitable replacement was found. A particular problem with the radar-equipped Mk VII, with the addition of the drag-producing aerials, was that it could not maintain altitude on one engine. Whitleys flew a total of 8,996 operations with Bomber Command, dropped 9,845 tons (8,931 tonnes) of bombs and 269 aircraft were lost in action.

On the night of 11/12 June 1940, the Whitley carried out Operation Haddock, the first RAF bombing raid on Italy, only a few hours after Italy&#x27;s declaration of war; the Whitleys bombed Turin and Genoa, reaching northern Italy via a refuelling stop in the Channel Islands. Many leading World War II bomber pilots of the RAF flew Whitleys at some point in their career, including Don Bennett, James Tait, and Leonard Cheshire.

On the night of 10/11 February 1941, six Whitley Vs of 51 Squadron led by Tait took part in Operation Colossus, the first airborne operation undertaken by the British military, delivering paratroops to attack the Tragino Aqueduct in southern Italy. The Whitley was not always popular with paratroopers as they exited via a bin like chute in the floor. If this was not timed correctly the airflow would drag the paratrooper out resulting in nasty injuries to the face against the lip of the chute known as a Whitley kiss.

On the night of 29/30 April 1942 No. 58 Squadron, flying Whitleys, bombed the Port of Ostend in Belgium. This was the last operational mission by a Whitley-equipped bomber squadron. In late 1942, the Whitley was retired from service as a frontline aircraft for bomber squadrons and was shifted to other roles. The type continued to operate delivering supplies and agents in the Special Duties squadrons (138 and 161) until December 1942, as well as serving as a transport for troops and freight, a carrier for paratroopers and a tow aircraft for gliders. In 1940, the Whitley had been selected as the standard paratroop transport; in this role, the ventral turret aperture was commonly modified to be used for the egress of paratroopers. No. 100 Group RAF used Whitleys to carry radar and electronic counter-measures. In February 1942, Whitleys were used to carry the paratroopers who participated in the Bruneval raid, code named Operation Biting, in which German radar components were captured from a German base on the coast of France.

Long-range Coastal Command Mk VII variants were among the last Whitleys remaining in front-line service, remaining in service until early 1943. The first U-boat kill attributed to the Whitley Mk VII was the sinking of the on 17 July 1942, which was achieved in combination with a Lancaster heavy bomber. Having evaluated the Whitley in 1942, the Fleet Air Arm operated a number of modified ex-RAF Mk VIIs from 1944 to 1946, to train aircrew in Merlin engine management and fuel transfer procedures.

===Civilian service===
In April/May 1942, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) operated 15 Whitley Mk V aircraft which had been converted into freighters. The conversion process involved the removal of all armaments, the turret recesses were faired over, additional fuel tanks were installed in the bomb bay, the interior of the fuselage was adapted for freight stowage, and at least one aircraft was fitted with an enlarged cargo door. The type was typically used for night supply flights from Gibraltar to Malta; the route took seven hours, and would often require landing during Axis air attacks on their arrival at Malta. Whitley freighters also flew the dangerous route between RAF Leuchars, Scotland and Stockholm, Sweden. The Whitley consumed a disproportionally large quantity of fuel to carry a relatively small payload and there were other reasons making the type less than ideal, so, in August 1942, the type was replaced by the Lockheed Hudson and the 14 survivors were returned to the RAF.
==Variants==
Following the two prototypes (&quot;K4586&quot; and &quot;K4587&quot;), at the outbreak of the war the RAF had 207 Whitleys in service ranging from Mk I to Mk IV types, with improved versions following:

;Mk I
:A.W. Type 188. Powered by Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX air-cooled radial engines, 4 degrees of dihedral incorporated into each outer wing panel, with earlier aircraft being retrospectively modified: 34 built.

;Mk II
:A.W. Type 197 (some Type 220). Powered by two-speed supercharged Tiger VIII engines: 46 built.

;Mk III
:A.W. Type 205. Powered by Tiger VIII engines, retractable &quot;dustbin&quot; ventral turret fitted aft of the wing root armed with two .303 in (7.7 mm) machine guns, hydraulically operated bomb bay doors and ability to carry larger bombs: 80 built.

;Mk IV
:A.W. Type 209. Powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin IV inline liquid-cooled engines, increased fuel capacity, extended bomb-aimer&#x27;s transparency, manually operated tail and retractable ventral turrets replaced with a single Nash &amp; Thompson powered tail turret equipped with four .303 in (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns, produced from 1938: 33 built.

;Mk IVA
:A.W. Type 210. Mk IV variant powered by Merlin X engines made by fitting Merlin X engines on last Mk IV&#x27;s on production line: seven built.

;Mk V
:A.W. Type 207. The main wartime production version based on the Mk IV, modified straight-edged fins, leading edge de-icing, tail fuselage aft or empennage extended by 15 in (381 mm) to improve the tail gunner&#x27;s field of fire. First flew in December 1938, production ceased in June 1943: 1,466 built.

;Mk VI
:Proposed Pratt &amp; Whitney G.R.1830 Twin Wasp-powered version of Mk V in case of Merlin production shortfall: none built.

;Mk VII
:A.W. Type 217. Designed for service with Coastal Command and carried a sixth crew member, capable of longer-range flights (2,300 mi/3,700 km compared to the early version&#x27;s having additional fuel tanks fitted in the bomb bay and fuselage, equipped with ASV Mk. II radar for anti-shipping patrols with an additional four &#x27;stickleback&#x27; dorsal radar masts and other antennae: 146 built. Being heavier, this mark could not maintain altitude on one engine.

==Surviving aircraft==

No complete aircraft of the 1,814 Whitleys produced remains. The Whitley Project is rebuilding an example from salvaged remains, and a fuselage section is displayed at the Midland Air Museum (MAM), whose site is adjacent to the airfield from where the Whitley&#x27;s maiden flight took place.

<doc id="561709" wikidata="Q280512" url="?curid=561709" title="Chattanooga Choo Choo">
<text>&quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; is a 1941 song that was written by Mack Gordon and composed by Harry Warren. It was originally recorded as a big band/swing tune by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra and featured in the 1941 movie &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot;. It was the first song to receive a gold record, presented by RCA Victor in 1942, for sales of 1.2 million copies.

==Background==
The song was an extended production number in the 20th Century Fox 1941 film &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot;. The Glenn Miller recording, catalogued RCA Bluebird B-11230-B, became the No. 1 song across the United States on December 7, 1941, and remained at No. 1 for nine weeks on the &quot;Billboard Best Sellers&quot; chart. The B-side of the single was &quot;I Know Why (And So Do You)&quot;, which at first was the A-side.

The song opens up with the band, sounding like a train rolling out of the station, complete with the trumpets and trombones imitating a train whistle, before the instrumental portion comes in playing two parts of the main melody. This is followed by the vocal introduction of four lines before the main part of the song is heard.

The main song opens with a dialog between a passenger and a shoeshine boy:

:&quot;Pardon me, boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?&quot; 
:&quot;Yes, yes, Track 29!&quot;
:&quot;Boy, you can give me a shine.&quot;
:&quot;Can you afford to board the Chattanooga Choo Choo?&quot;
:&quot;I&#x27;ve got my fare, and just a trifle to spare.&quot;

The singer describes the train route, originating from Pennsylvania Station in New York and running through Baltimore to North Carolina before reaching Terminal Station in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He mentions a woman he knew from an earlier time in his life, who will be waiting for him at the station and with whom he plans to settle down for good. After the entire song is sung, the band plays two parts of the main melody as an instrumental, with the instruments imitating the &quot;WHOO WHOO&quot; of the train as the song ends.

The lyrics reference other popular songs of the 1920s and 1940s, such as &quot;Nothing could be finer than to have your ham and eggs in Carolina&quot;, &quot;When you hear the whistle blowin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar&quot;, and &quot;Satin and lace, I used to call &#x27;funny face&#x27;&quot;. 

The 78-rpm was recorded on May 7, 1941, for RCA Victor&#x27;s Bluebird Records and became the first to be certified a gold disc on February 10, 1942, for 1,200,000 sales. The transcription of this award ceremony can be heard on the first of three volumes of RCA&#x27;s &quot;Legendary Performer&quot; compilations released by RCA in the 1970s. In the early 1990s a two-channel recording of a portion of the &quot;Sun Valley Serenade&quot; soundtrack was discovered, allowing reconstruction of a true-stereo version of the film performance.
The composition was nominated for an Academy Award in 1941 for Best Song from a movie. The song achieved its success that year even though it could not be heard on network radio for much of 1941 due to the ASCAP boycott.

In 1996, the 1941 recording of &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Inspiration==

The song was written by the team of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren, allegedly while traveling on the Southern Railway&#x27;s &quot;Birmingham Special&quot; train. This was one of three trains operating from New York City via Chattanooga. The &quot;Tennessean&quot; continued to Memphis while the &quot;Pelican&quot; continued to New Orleans via Birmingham. The Southern Railway operated these trains in cooperation with the Norfolk and Western Railway and the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Details in the song do not align with &quot;The Birmingham Special&quot;, however, which suggests that the writers took some artistic license. Specifically:

* The train is described as departing from Track 29 in Pennsylvania Station. At the time, the facility only had 21 tracks.
* &quot;You leave the Pennsylvania station &#x27;bout a quarter to four&quot;, but &quot;The Birmingham Special&quot; departed at 12:30 p.m.
* &quot;Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer than to have your ham &#x27;n&#x27; eggs in Carolina&quot;, but none of these three trains passed through the Carolinas. They passed through western Virginia directly to East Tennessee.

==Personnel==

On the May 7, 1941 original recording by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra in Hollywood on RCA Bluebird, the featured singer was Tex Beneke, who was accompanied by Paula Kelly, the Modernaires (vocals), Billy May, John Best, Ray Anthony, R. D. McMickle (trumpet), Glenn Miller, Jim Priddy, Paul Tanner, Frank D&#x27;Annolfo (trombone), Hal McIntyre, Wilbur Schwartz (clarinet, alto saxophone), Tex Beneke, Al Klink (tenor saxophone), Ernie Caceres (baritone saxophone), Chummy MacGregor (piano), Jack Lathrop (guitar), Trigger Alpert (bass), and Maurice Purtill (drums). The arrangement was by Jerry Gray.

==Notable renditions==

The song has been recorded by numerous artists, including Taco, Beegie Adair, the Andrews Sisters, Ray Anthony, Asleep at the Wheel with Willie Nelson, BBC Big Band, George Benson, John Bunch, Caravelli, Regina Carter, Ray Charles, Harry Connick Jr., Ray Conniff, John Denver, Ernie Fields, Stéphane Grappelli and Marc Fosset, John Hammond Jr., the Harmonizing Four, Harmony Grass, Ted Heath, Betty Johnson, Susannah McCorkle, Ray McKinley, Big Miller, the Muppets, Richard Perlmutter, Oscar Peterson, Spike Robinson, Harry Roy, Jan Savitt, Hank Snow, Teddy Stauffer, Dave Taylor, Claude Thornhill, the Tornados, Vox and Guy Van Duser.

Other notable performances include:
* Cab Calloway and His Orchestra recorded a cover version of &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; for Conqueror Records in 1941.
* Carmen Miranda recorded a cover on July 25, 1942, and sang it in the movie &quot;Springtime in the Rockies&quot;.
* Bill Haley &amp; His Comets released a cover of &quot;Chattanooga Choo Choo&quot; as a 45 single on Essex Records in 1954.
* Pianist Floyd Cramer recorded a single version on RCA Records in 1962.
* UK instrumental group the Shadows recorded a version of the song for their album &quot;Dance with the Shadows&quot;, which reached number two in the UK album charts in 1964.
* The American musical group Harpers Bizarre released a cover version of the song, which reached No. 45 on the U.S. pop chart and spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Easy Listening chart in 1968. In Canada, the song reached No. 34.
* An instrumental version of the theme was released 1975 in Germany under the name &quot;Maddox&quot;, produced by Dicky Tarrach.
* In the 1974 film &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot;, when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein asks a local boy for directions to the Transylvania Station, their dialogue closely follows the song&#x27;s lyrics.
* In 1978, the jazz-influenced disco group Tuxedo Junction recorded a disco version that hit the American Top 40; it peaked at No. 32 Pop and No. 18 on the Easy Listening chart. In Canada, it reached No. 55 on the Pop charts and No. 6 on the Dance charts.

==German and Dutch versions==
*The tune was adopted twice for German songs. Both songs deal with trains, and both songs start with (different) translations of &quot;pardon me&quot;. The first was created and performed in 1947 by the German pop singer Bully Buhlan (&quot;Zug nach Kötzschenbroda&quot;). The lyrics are humorously describing the bother of a train ride out of post-war Berlin: no guarantee to arrive at a destination due to coal shortage, passengers traveling on coach buffers, steps and roofs, and never-ending trip interruptions including a night stop for delousing.
*The second, &quot;Sonderzug nach Pankow&quot;, created by the German rock musician Udo Lindenberg in 1983 became very popular and had various political implications. Lindenberg was a West German singer and songwriter with a suitable fan community in East Germany. He had applied for years to tour East Germany but was rejected several times. The 1983 cover version of Chattanooga Choo Choo was directly asking the East Germany&#x27;s leader Erich Honecker for permission to hold a concert in the Palace of the Republic (Berlin). The song was released on February 2, 1983. The song itself and the Glenn Miller original were temporarily interdicted in the GDR.

Nevertheless, Lindenberg finally succeeded in getting an invitation to the East German festival Rock for Peace on October 25, 1983, on the condition that Lindenberg would not play &quot;Sonderzug nach Pankow&quot; at the concert. Honecker, a former brass band drummer of Rotfrontkämpferbund, and Lindenberg exchanged presents in form of a leather jacket and a metal shawm in 1987. Lindenberg&#x27;s success at passing the Inner German border peacefully with a humorous song gave him celebrity status as well as a positive political acknowledgement in both West and East Germany.
*Lindenberg&#x27;s version was adapted by Dutch singer Willem Duyn as &quot;Ik Neem De Eerste Trein Naar Zandvoort&quot; (free translation; &quot;I&#x27;ll Take The Morning train to Zandvoort&quot;) who made it a summer-hit in 1983. In the lyrics Duyn chronicles chaos and mayhem on the morning seaside-train.

==Italian versions==
*There is an Italian version sung by Domenico Loreti entitled &quot;Il treno della neve&quot; (The Snow Train) and one by Sorelle Marinetti included in the 2010 album &quot;Signorine novecento&quot; (Atlantic, 5051865974321).

==Finnish version==
*A Finnish song based upon the Chattanooga Choo Choo was made in 1963 about &quot;Ukko Pekka&quot;, one of Finland&#x27;s most famous locomotives. It was sung by Finnish band Eero ja Jussi &amp; The Boys.

==Wartime release==
In October 1944, a new recording by Captain Glenn Miller and the Army Air Forces Training Command Orchestra featuring Sgt. Ray McKinley and the Crew Chiefs on vocals was released as a V-Disc by the U.S. War Department, one of a series of recordings sent free by the U.S. War Department to overseas military personnel during World War II.

==Legacy and popular culture==
Trains have a pride of place in Chattanooga&#x27;s former Terminal Station. Once owned and operated by the Southern Railway, the station was saved from demolition after the withdrawal of passenger rail service in the early 1970s, and it is now part of a 30-acre (12-hectare) resort complex, including the Chattanooga Choo Choo Hotel, and numerous historical railway exhibits. Hotel guests can stay in half of a restored passenger railway car. Dining at the complex includes the Gardens restaurant in the Terminal Station itself, The Station House (which is housed in a former baggage storage room and known for its singing waitstaff) and the &quot;Dinner in the Diner&quot; which is housed in a restored 1941 Class A dining car. The music venue &quot;Track29&quot; is also on the grounds of the Chattanooga Choo Choo hotel in the building that formerly housed the city&#x27;s only ice rink at the back of the property. The city&#x27;s other historic station, Union Station, parts of which predated the Civil War, was demolished in 1973; the site is now an office building formerly housing the corporate offices of the Krystal restaurant chain (the restaurant chain offices have since relocated to Atlanta, Georgia). In addition to the railroad exhibits at &quot;the Choo Choo&quot;, there are further exhibits at Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum, in east Chattanooga.

The reputation given to the city by the song also has lent itself to making Chattanooga the home of the National Model Railroad Association since 1982. In addition, the athletic mascot of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga was, for a time, a rather menacing-looking anthropomorphized mockingbird named Scrappy, who was dressed as a railroad engineer and was sometimes depicted at the throttle of a steam locomotive.

Choo Choo DME, a radio aid to navigation, is sited near Chattanooga at .

<doc id="561711" wikidata="Q908286" url="?curid=561711" title="Japan–China Joint Communiqué">
<text>The Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China was signed on September 29, 1972, in Beijing. The communique established and normalized diplomatic relations between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), resulted in the severing of official relations between Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan. The document produced nine articles in a joint statement, showing compromises on previously ambiguous principles enunciated by both sides. Of these, four points are particularly worthy of attention:

# the desire for a peace treaty between Japan and China;
# the statement that Japan &quot;understands and respects [China&#x27;s] stance&quot; that Taiwan is part of the PRC;
# an Asia-Pacific anti-hegemony clause;
# Japan&#x27;s reversal of relations with China and Taiwan.

The document ended the &quot;abnormal relations between Japan and China&quot;, recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the &quot;sole government of China&quot;, and renounced any claim for war reparations from World War II. In addition, it concluded various administrative agreements between the two countries in trade, fisheries, aviation, and navigation, amongst others. The document firmly maintains its stance under Article 8 of the Potsdam Declaration.

== Before the communique ==

=== Japan&#x27;s relations with ROC ===
Taiwan was under Japanese rule from 1895 to 1945. After the Korean War, the Japanese government during the Yoshida Cabinet lost its hope of establishing substantial relations with Peking, and instead began taking into consideration the prospect of signing a peace treaty and establishing diplomatic normalization with Taipei. Japan at the time also carried the debt of gratitude to Nationalist China, as Chiang Kai-shek made the announcement of &quot;returning virtue for malice&quot; () and repatriated all the Japanese troops. As a result, on 25 April 1952, according to the Yoshida Letter, &quot;the Japanese government has no intention to conclude a bilateral treaty with the Communist regime in China&quot;, and later the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty was signed. During this time in the early 1950s, Japan was put under pressure by the US to not recognize the newly established PRC which was at war with the US in Korea, and instead recognized the government of ROC led by Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government of China. Tokyo then signed a peace treaty with Taipei as a proof to this close tie.

=== Japan&#x27;s relations with PRC ===
Before normalization from 1952 to 1972, Japan only had diplomatic relations with Taiwan and not China. Although Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was in support of Taiwan, he regarded China as a threat, in keeping with the United States&#x27; policy on China. 
Despite this, Japan was interested in restoring relations with China due to cultural, security, and economic interests. Japan and China have been neighboring countries for almost two thousand years and share many cultural, historic, and religious heritages. In terms of security interests, Japan wanted to restore its relations with China in order to set the tone for a peaceful diplomatic relationship after years of war.

From 1950 to 1972, trade between Japan and China existed but was relatively limited. At first, trade was restricted due to events such as the Korean War, a Chinese embargo on Japan in 1958, and tensions regarding the recognition of Taiwan. Later, the 1960 &quot;Japan-China Trade Principle&quot; led to the growth in selective trade that became more regularized after diplomatic relations resumed in 1972.

After the economic &quot;Nixon shock&quot; in 1971, Chinese businesses became more attractive for the Japanese economy than previously. Eventually, Prime Minister Sato resigned, which led to the election and next cabinet of Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. Prime Minister Tanaka made the restoration of relations between Japan and China an issue of priority in his agenda, hence his pursuing of the Joint Communique. This was beneficial for China as well, since it could lead to a smooth entry back into the international society and economy and could end the state of war between China and Japan. The February 1972 visit by Richard Nixon to China, leading to the Shanghai Communiqué, also played a role. The surprising Sino-American rapprochement boosted the possibility of a communique between China and Japan.

=== UN&#x27;s recognition of PRC ===

1971 witnessed an erosion of Taiwan&#x27;s international position and a shift in Japan–ROC–PRC relations. Firstly, the Nixon administration removed travel and trading barriers, as well as proposed a more serious dialogue with Peking due to Cold War politics and the US–Soviet situation. Secondly, in 1971, the United Nations General Assembly voted to admit the PRC into the UN.

From 1945 until 1971, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist regime occupied the so-called &quot;China seat&quot; as an original member and one of the five permanent members of the Security Council under the auspices of the US and a moratorium against Communist China (PRC). However, due to decolonization and the admission of numerous Third World states to the General Assembly, Washington lost its grip on the UN and could no longer sustain the moratorium. Thus, the Chinese representation issue was considered as an &quot;important question&quot; which required a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly for a resolution to pass.

On October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly led by Albania voted to admit the PRC and to expel the ROC. The 17 UN members during the General Assembly declared that the existence of the PRC was &quot;a reality that could not be changed to suit the myth of a so-called Republic of China, fabricated out of a portion of Chinese territory&quot;, and that the ROC were &quot;unlawful authorities&quot; that remained there only because of the permanent presence of the US Armed Forces. PRC, therefore, assumed the ROC&#x27;s place in the General Assembly as well as its place as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

After the UN General Assembly vote on Peking and Taipei, it was hinted that Japan no longer recognized the Chiang Kai-shek government as the sole legitimate government of China, but only as the government of Taiwan, and that Japan was ready to shift recognition to Peking. In short, Taipei&#x27;s failure to remain in the UN&#x27;s Security Council and the General Assembly, along with the Sino-US rapprochement, pushed the Japanese government towards achieving normalization with Peking through establishing the Joint Communique and ultimately severing diplomatic relations with the ROC.

== Terms of communique ==

=== Initial proposals ===

==== Japan ====
On September 26–27, 1972, Japan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ōhira and PRC&#x27;s Foreign Minister Ji Pengfei met to negotiate a proposal for the declaration. 
Japan explained that they should raise the issue of the state of war between China and Japan in Clause 1. Japan explained to China that they could not accept China&#x27;s interpretation of officially ending the state of war in this joint declaration. This was because China was not bound by the Treaty of Taipei (a peace treaty between Japan and Taiwan), by which Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) government of Chiang Kai-shek had already established the end of World War II. Japan negotiated to emphasize the existence of a peaceful relationship between the two countries and leave the specific timing of the end of the state of war unspecified. Although Japan&#x27;s standpoint on the Treaty of Taipei did not change, if diplomatic normalization between Japan and China were to be established, Japan was willing to terminate the Treaty of Taipei.

==== PRC ====
In 1971, a Japanese delegation of politicians from the Komeito party visited Beijing and announced in a joint statement with the China–Japan Friendship Association that there were five preconditions for relations between Japan and China:

# there is only one China, and the government of the People&#x27;s Republic is the sole legitimate government representing the Chinese people;
# Taiwan is a province of China and an inalienable part of Chinese territory;
# the &quot;Japan-Chiang [Peace] Treaty &quot; is illegal and must be abrogated;
# the United States must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits area;
# the legitimate rights of the People&#x27;s Republic in all United Nations organizations must be restored and the representatives of Taiwan expelled.

These principles were approved by Chinese premier Zhou Enlai and did not represent anything new to what China had long been asking of Japan. In fact, these proposals date back to 1953. Dissenting members in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), opposition parties, and the left-wing Japan Communist Party (JCP) accepted the first three points without reservation. However, the LDP was hesitant to approve China&#x27;s proposal, especially since the first two points suggested Japan would have to abolish their peace treaty with Taiwan. Furthermore, in addition, point 4 was beyond Japan&#x27;s capacity, as they hold no sovereign power over US maritime activity in the region. Lastly, point 5 lost its relevance after China joined the UN in 1971.

=== Negotiations between Japan and PRC ===

==== Outline proposal ====
The outline proposal in which the Foreign Minister of Japan, Masayoshi Ōhira, and Foreign Minister of China, Ji Pengfei, agreed upon for the Japan–China Joint Declaration can be seen as follows:

# The state of war between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China ends on the date of the declaration.
# The Government of Japan fully recognizes the Three Principles for the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and China that was presented by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and also fully recognizes that the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the sole and lawful government of China.
# Both parties declare that the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan conforms to the long-term wishes of their respective citizens and that it is in line with the benefit of the peoples of the world.
# Both parties agree to treat relations between China and Japan on the basis of the Five Principles: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual nonaggression; mutual noninterference in each other&#x27;s internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. In accordance with the Five Principles, disputes between China and Japan will be resolved through peaceful dialogue and without the use of force or the threat of force.
# Both parties declare that neither China nor Japan will seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and will oppose any country or group of countries that seek hegemony in this manner.
# Both parties agree to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship that is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence after the establishment of diplomatic relations.
# For the sake of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan, the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China abandons its right to demand war reparations from Japan.
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Government of Japan, prior to the conclusion of a peace and friendship treaty, will conclude agreements on commerce, shipping, air traffic, weather, post, fisheries, and science and technology on the basis of need and preexistence in order to promote the human exchange the economic and cultural relations.

==== Draft of joint declaration ====
The governments of Japan and China agreed upon a draft Joint declaration as follows:

* China and Japan are only separated by a sea, and a perpetual and traditionally friendly relationship existed in the history between the two countries. The peoples of both countries long to correct the extremely anomalous state that existed between the two countries. The reestablishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan will open a new page for the history of relations between the two countries.
* (The Government of Japan is deeply repentant over the damages that Japanese militarism has caused on the people of China in the past. At the same time, the Government of Japan fully recognizes the Three Principles for the Restoration of Relations submitted by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. From this standpoint diplomatic normalization between China and Japan will be conducted.)
* The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China welcomes this. Although the social policies of China and Japan differ, the two countries should and can have peaceful and friendly relations. The renewed establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and the development of friendly neighbor relations is not only in line with the fundamental interest of the citizens of both countries, but is also useful for the relaxation of tensions in Asia and for the protection of world peace.
* The Governments of both countries have reached the following agreements through friendly discussion:

# On the date of the announcement of the joint declaration, the state of war between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Japan will end.
# (The Government of Japan recognizes the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the solely lawful government of representing China) The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China once more declares that Taiwan is an indivisible part of the territory of China. (The Government of Japan endorses, based on the Cairo Declaration, the Government of China&#x27;s standpoint.)
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Government Japan have decided to establish diplomatic relations from September (date) 1972. In line with international law and international custom, both Governments of the respective countries will establish in each other&#x27;s capitals the embassies and other establishments necessary to carry out their functions. In addition, they agree to exchange ambassadors as quickly as possible.
# For the sake of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan, the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China renounces its claims for war reparations.
# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China agree to establish a permanent, friendly relationships following the Five Principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, nonintervention in domestic issues, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Government of Japan declare that both countries shall not seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, and that both countries will oppose any country or group of countries that seek to establish hegemony in this manner.
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Government Japan have agreed to conclude a treaty of peace and friendship in order to develop the peaceful and friendly relations between the peoples of both countries.
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Government of Japan will conclude individual agreements on commerce, shipping, air traffic, fisheries, weather, post, and science and technology on the basis of need and in accordance to preexisting agreements in order to develop the economic and cultural relations between the two countries and to expand the exchange of people.

The sections in parentheses are as appears in the original document.

==== Final agreement ====
 
From September 25 to September 30, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka visited the PRC at the invitation of Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Zhou Enlai. Accompanying PM Tanaka were Minister for Foreign Affairs Masayoshi Ōhira, Chief Cabinet Secretary Susumu Nikaido, and other government officials.
Chinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong met Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka on September 27.

PM Tanaka and FM Ōhira had an earnest and frank exchange of views with Premier Zhou Enlai and Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei on the question of normalizing relations between Japan and China, as well as other problems and matters of interest between the two countries. In the end, they agreed to issue the following Joint Communique:

* Japan and China are neighboring countries, separated only by a strip of water with a long history of traditional friendship. The people of the two countries earnestly desire to put an end to the abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between the two countries. The realization of the aspiration of the two peoples for the termination of the state of war and the normalization of relations between Japan and China will add a new page to the annals of relations between the two countries.
* The Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself. Further, the Japanese side reaffirms its position that it intends to realize the normalization of relations between the two countries from the stand of fully understanding &#x27;the three principles for the restoration of relations&quot; put forward by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Chinese side expresses its welcome for this.
* In spite of the differences in their social systems existing between the two countries, the two countries should, and can, establish relations of peace and friendship. The normalization of relations and development of good-neighborly and friendly relations between the two countries are in the interests of the two peoples and will contribute to the relaxation of tension in Asia and peace in the world.

# The abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between Japan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China is terminated on the date on which this Joint Communique is issued.
# The Government of Japan recognizes that Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China reiterates that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Government of Japan fully understands and respects this stance of the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and it firmly maintains its stand under Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation.
# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China have decided to establish diplomatic relations as from September 29, 1972. The two Governments have decided to take all necessary measures for the establishment and the performance of the functions of each other&#x27;s embassy in their respective capitals in accordance with international law and practice, and to exchange ambassadors as speedily as possible.
# The Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China declares that, in the interest of the friendship between the Chinese and the Japanese peoples, it renounces its demand for war reparations from Japan.
# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China agree to establish relations of perpetual peace and friendship between the two countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other&#x27;s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. The two Governments confirm that, in conformity with the foregoing principles and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Japan and China shall in their mutual relations settle all disputes by peaceful means and shall refrain from the use or threat of force.
# The normalization of relations between Japan and China is not directed against any third country. Neither of the two countries should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.
# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China have agreed that, with a view to solidifying and developing the relations of peace and friendship between the two countries, the two Governments will enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace and friendship.
# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China have agreed that, with a view to further promoting relations between the two countries and to expanding interchanges of people, the two Governments will, as necessary and taking account of the existing non-governmental arrangements, enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding agreements concerning such matters as trade, shipping, aviation, and fisheries.

== Reactions of the public==

=== Japan ===
A survey conducted by the Japanese Cabinet in 1978 showed that 62.1% of Japanese people who participated in the survey had &quot;friendly feelings toward China&quot; and 25.6% did &quot;not have friendly feelings toward China&quot;. These survey results showed that a large proportion of the population had improved feelings toward China after the Joint Communique was agreed upon. This was mainly because of China&#x27;s withdrawal of any war compensation claims made to the Japanese people in addition to their approval of the United States–Japan Security Treaty. In 1980, the same survey was conducted on the Japanese people, which showed, 78.6% had &quot;friendly feelings toward China&quot; and just 14.7% did &quot;not have friendly feelings toward China&quot;.

=== PRC ===
In the 1990s, criticism and dissatisfaction over the terms of the Joint Communique started to become a topic of discussion between the Chinese people. This was mainly towards the terms agreed upon regarding war reparations and compensation by the Japanese to the Chinese. Chinese people felt that the government had made a decision without consulting with the population first. In response to this, the Chinese government clarified the terms of the Joint Communique. They emphasized that although the Chinese government cannot demand compensation, Chinese citizens as individuals still have the right to demand compensation.

=== ROC ===
Before the announcement of the communique, there were signs of public anxiety toward expanded US–Sino relations. PM Tanaka&#x27;s trip to Peking (September 25–30) was greeted with anger. Taipei delayed the mission of Tanaka&#x27;s special envoy, Etsusaburo Shiina, so that it coincided with the 41st anniversary of the September 18 Mukden Incident, an infamous episode in the difficult course of Sino–Japanese relations. When Shiina met with new ROC Premier Chiang Ching-kuo and Vice President Yen Chia-kan, he was greeted with rare mass demonstrations. His picture was neither on TV nor in the press, in contrast with the wide coverage of another concurrent visitor, the Mayor of Seoul.

In response to the situation, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s son, Chiang Ching-kuo, in his inaugural speech on June 13, 1972, reassured citizens at a time of national diversity by confirming the stance of Nationalist China (ROC) that there were only &quot;one conflict&quot; (the struggle between the humanitarian rule of the Three Principles of the People and the tyrannical rule of Chinese communists), &quot;one war&quot; (the recovery of the mainland), &quot;one responsibility&quot; (the elimination of the communists), and &quot;one outcome&quot; (the victory of Nationalist China).

== Aftermath==

=== Japan–PRC relations ===
The normalization of diplomatic relationships between China and Japan was said to have contributed greatly to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and peace. Since normalization, both economic and cultural exchange started to improve. The interactions between the people of China and Japan also improved.

From 1979 onwards, Japan started offering Official Development Assistance (ODA) to China. This was done with numerous projects, such as energy development, infrastructure development, and environmental protection, using low-interest yen loans, grants, and the transfer of technological materials. This ODA helped grow and open up the Chinese economy. Normalization also allowed for Japanese companies to pursue business in the large Chinese market, which benefited the Japanese economy. These efforts led to increased dependency on both sides.

In terms of cultural exchanges, Japanese Sumo wrestlers toured China in April 1973, and in the same month China dispatched 55 members for a goodwill mission in Japan. A Chinese cultural delegation visited Japan in June 1973 to view Chinese art treasures which belonged to the Japanese Imperial Household.

In terms of economic and trade relations, many economic delegations and representatives of banks and firms of both countries subsequently visited each other. Within the first year of normalized relations, 28 Japanese Economic and Trade missions visited China. This included the Yasuhiro Nakasone mission in January 1973 and delegations representing the Promotion of International Trade (Kokubosoku). According to the Ministry of Finance, there was an 83% increase of trade between China and Japan in 1973 compared to the previous year. This can be explained by several reasons. For one, the Tanaka government of Japan made credits available for the Export-Import Bank of China. At the same time, Peking was increasing its efforts to accelerate its five-year economic plan which lasted from 1971 to 1975. It was also suggested that China felt apprehensive about Japan&#x27;s potential involvement in the Soviet-proposed multi-dimensional development plan in Siberia. 
Although Japan and China&#x27;s economic relationship has remained largely stable, other issues have caused friction within their relationship, such as historical problems and the Senkaku-Diaoyu Islands dispute.

=== Japan–ROC relations ===
Had Chiang Kai-shek managed to keep the UN &quot;China seat&quot; by abandoning his &quot;One China policy&quot; more clearly and timely in 1971, PM Tanaka would not have been so keen on normalizing relations with Beijing in 1972 and Taipei would have avoided severing relations with Tokyo.

After Tokyo and Peking normalized relations in 1972, there was a formal disengagement of the Japanese authorities from Taiwan. On December 26, 1972, two private associations were created to supervise bilateral exchanges between Tokyo and Taipei: the Interchange Association on Tokyo&#x27;s side and the East Asian Relations Association on Taipei&#x27;s side (&quot;Japan&quot; and &quot;Taiwan&quot; are avoided in the names of both associations). The two associations carried out functions that were normally handled by consular institutions. For example, Taipei&#x27;s high-ranking civil servants accompanying commercial missions to Japan were introduced as simple experts with ordinary passports. In short, Tokyo–Taipei&#x27;s relations were relegated to the private sector.

In terms of economic impacts of the communique, despite the deteriorated diplomatic relations with Japan, Taiwan&#x27;s trade with many countries continued to flourish. However, in 1974, Taiwan had a $1.336 billion trade deficit with Japan. In the following year, the trade deficit with Japan was $1.101 billion, a drop of $235 million compared to 1974 but nearly double Taiwan&#x27;s overall 1975 deficit of $611 million. Moreover, a strong sense of antagonism intensely arose and harmed Japanese businesses in Taiwan; for example, Japan Airlines soon had to take special precautions against sabotage on every flight to and from Taiwan. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese supporters of Taiwan continued to advocate for the country&#x27;s independence movement. Pro-Taiwan voices were down in the 1970s but were never totally gone. These supporters acted as check-and-balance mechanisms to prevent the Japanese government from going too far in improving Japan–China relations at the expense of sacrificing Taiwan&#x27;s interests. After the Tiananmen Massacre in June 1989 temporarily ruptured Sino-Japanese relations, Beijing&#x27;s intolerance of democratic ideas made democratized Taiwan more favorable in Japanese eyes. Japan-based pro-independence activists promoted Japanese popular awareness of Taiwan as an independent country. Additionally, during this period, the booming of tourism and mainstream media returned to Taiwan.

=== US–China–Japan relations after the communique ===
From 1972 to 1978, some have argued that the Cold War was the golden period of US–China–Japan cooperation; however, always within the context of the US–China security relationship. Sino-US relations constrained their respective policies toward third parties, especially Japan. There were suggestions that Washington might not be pleased with the Joint Communique, which reaffirmed that Sino-Japanese security cooperation could place Japan ahead of the US. Even after the establishment of the communique that represented the normalized Sino-Japanese relations, Japan&#x27;s China policy was still affected by that of the US, as Japan depended on the US for security. Additionally, Sino-Japanese trade continued to boom, and Peking continued to pressure Japan to sign a peace treaty containing the anti-hegemony language of the 1972 normalization agreement. Overall, during the Carter administration, the triangular US-China-Japan relations continued to prevail. However, under the influence of the US, Peking &quot;lacked the leverage to persuade Japan to adopt a China policy fundamentally different from that of the US&quot;.

<doc id="561717" wikidata="Q422087" url="?curid=561717" title="Dimethylmercury">
<text>Dimethylmercury is an extremely toxic organomercury compound with the formula (CH3)2Hg. A volatile, flammable, dense and colorless liquid, dimethylmercury is one of the strongest known neurotoxins. Less than 0.1 mL is capable of inducing severe mercury poisoning resulting in death.

==Synthesis, structure, and reactions==
The compound was one of the earliest organometallics reported, reflecting its considerable stability. The compound was first prepared by George Buckton in 1857 by a reaction of methylmercury iodide with potassium cyanide:
: 2 CH3HgI + 2 KCN → Hg(CH3)2 + 2 KI + (CN)2 + Hg
Later, Edward Frankland discovered that it could be synthesized by treating sodium amalgam with methyl halides:
: Hg + 2 Na + 2 CH3I → Hg(CH3)2 + 2 NaI
It can also be obtained by alkylation of mercuric chloride with methyllithium:
: HgCl2 + 2 LiCH3 → Hg(CH3)2 + 2 LiCl
The molecule adopts a linear structure with Hg–C bond lengths of 2.083 Å.

===Reactivity and physical properties===
Dimethylmercury is stable in water and reacts with mineral acids at a significant rate only at elevated temperatures, whereas the corresponding organocadmium and organozinc compounds (and most metal alkyls in general) hydrolyze rapidly. The difference reflects the high electronegativity of Hg (Pauling EN = 2.00) and the low affinity of Hg(II) for oxygen ligands. The compound undergoes a redistribution reaction with mercuric chloride to give methylmercury chloride:
: (CH3)2Hg + HgCl2 → 2 CH3HgCl
Whereas dimethylmercury is a volatile liquid, methylmercury chloride is a crystalline solid.

==Use==
Dimethylmercury has few applications because of the risks involved. It has been studied for reactions involving bonding methylmercury cations to target molecules, forming potent bactericides, but methylmercury&#x27;s bioaccumulation and ultimate toxicity has led to it being largely abandoned in favor of the less toxic ethylmercury and diethylmercury compounds, which perform a similar function without the bioaccumulation hazard.

In toxicology, it still finds limited use as a reference toxin. It is also used to calibrate NMR instruments for detection of mercury (δ 0 ppm for 199Hg NMR), although diethylmercury and less toxic mercury salts are now preferred.

Around 1960, Phil Pomerantz, a man working at the Bureau of Naval Weapons, suggested that dimethylmercury be used as a fuel mix with red fuming nitric acid. This was never done, although it did lead to testing a red fuming nitric acid-unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine rocket with elemental mercury being injected into the combustion chamber at the Naval Ordnance Test Station.

==Safety==
Dimethylmercury is extremely toxic and dangerous to handle. Absorption of doses as low as 0.1 mL can result in severe mercury poisoning. The risks are enhanced because of the compound&#x27;s high vapor pressure. Since it is highly lipophilic, it absorbs through the skin and into body fat very easily and can permeate many materials, including many plastics and rubber compounds.

Permeation tests showed that several types of disposable latex or polyvinyl chloride gloves (typically, about 0.1 mm thick), commonly used in most laboratories and clinical settings, had high and maximal rates of permeation by dimethylmercury within 15 seconds. The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) advises handling dimethylmercury with highly resistant laminated gloves with an additional pair of abrasion-resistant gloves worn over the laminate pair, and also recommends using a face shield and working in a fume hood.

Dimethylmercury is metabolized after several days to methylmercury. Methylmercury crosses the blood–brain barrier easily, probably owing to formation of a complex with cysteine. It easily absorbs into the body and has a tendency to bioaccumulate. The symptoms of poisoning may be delayed by months, resulting in cases in which a diagnosis is ultimately discovered, but only at a point in which it is too late or almost too late for an effective treatment regimen to be successful. Methylmercury poisoning is also known as Minamata disease.

== Incidents ==
* As early as 1865, two workers in the laboratory of Edward Frankland died after exhibiting progressive neurological symptoms following accidental exposure to the compound.
* Karen Wetterhahn, a professor of chemistry at Dartmouth College, died in 1997, ten months after spilling only a few drops of dimethylmercury onto her latex gloves. This incident resulted in improved awareness of the substance&#x27;s extreme toxicity, and its ability to easily penetrate latex, compared to less porous materials such as nitrile. New OSHA material-handling guidelines were published, many institutions purged their supplies of the compound, and it became almost impossible to buy.
* Christoph Bulwin, a 40-year-old German database administrator for IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie, claimed to have been attacked with a syringe-tipped umbrella on 15 July 2011 in Hanover, Germany. Bulwin, who died a year later from mercury poisoning, had said he confiscated the syringe, which was later found to contain dimethylmercury. According to a 2020 article in &quot;Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology,&quot; police investigations revealed a syringe containing a typical mercury thallium compound in Bulwin&#x27;s car, and mercury and thallium in thermometers at his workplace. Inconclusive antemortem and postmortem blood, urine, and tissue analysis cast doubts on the assault account. The absence of an identified assailant or motive, as well as the presence of different mercury compounds in Bulwin&#x27;s car, led police to conclude that the intoxication was likely self-administered, thereby terminating the preliminary investigation. The &quot;Forensic Science, Medicine and Pathology&quot; account is contradicted by other reports, including the August 24, 2022 episode of the German flagship true crime TV program Aktenzeichen XY .. ungelöst that was co-edited by the Hannover criminal police and in which information was solicited from the public based on Bulwin&#x27;s own umbrella scenario.

<text>The Log Cabin Republicans (LCR) is an organization affiliated with the Republican Party which works to educate the LGBT+ community and Republicans about each other.

==History==
Log Cabin Republicans was formed in 1977 in California as a rallying point for Republicans opposed to the Briggs Initiative, which attempted to ban homosexuals from teaching in public schools, and proposed legislation authorized the firing of those teachers who publicly &quot;supported&quot; homosexuality.

While mounting his imminent presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan publicly expressed his opposition to the discriminatory policy. Reagan&#x27;s condemnation of the bill—epitomized in a letter sent to a pro-Briggs group, excerpts of which were re-printed in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1978—played an influential role in the eventual defeat of the Briggs Initiative.

In the midst of this victory, gay conservatives in California created the Log Cabin Republicans. The group initially proposed to name themselves Lincoln Club, but found that name was already in use by the Lincoln Club of Orange County, another California Republican organization, so the name Log Cabin Republicans was chosen as an alternative title. This designation calls attention to the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln. The Log Cabin Republicans suggest that Lincoln founded the Republican Party on the philosophies of liberty and equality. These principles, Log Cabin argues, are consistent with their platform of an inclusive Republican Party.

===1992 presidential election===
The 1992 Log Cabin Republican convention was held in Spring, Texas, a Houston exurb. The main point of discussion was whether or not LCR would endorse the re-election of President George H. W. Bush. The group voted to deny that endorsement because Bush did not denounce anti-gay rhetoric at the 1992 Republican National Convention.

===1996 presidential election===
In August 1995, the campaign of Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole, returned the LCR&#x27;s $1,000 campaign contribution. The campaign returned the contribution after the openly lesbian columnist, Deb Price, of the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, asked about it after she saw it on a public report from the Federal Election Commission. The campaign sent a written statement to Price saying that Dole was in &quot;100% disagreement with the agenda of the Log Cabin Republicans.&quot; The finance office of the campaign had solicited the contribution from LCR. At the event where it was given, Dole had personally spoken with LCR&#x27;s then-executive director, Rich Tafel, about the group and about AIDS legislation it was promoting in the Senate. Weeks earlier, Dole agreed to co-sponsor the legislation after a meeting with Tafel at the campaign&#x27;s headquarters. It resulted in a front-page story in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, penned by Richard L. Berke, then-chief political reporter for the daily.

As reporters, including Berke, were seeking confirmation of the story before it broke, Dole&#x27;s finance chairman, John Moran, asked Tafel not to speak to the press and that Tafel&#x27;s &quot;steadfastness and statesmanship at this moment will be handsomely appreciated in the long run by the campaign.&quot; Tafel refused.

Pundits accused Dole of being a &quot;flip-flopper and a hypocrite.&quot; Editorials ran in major newspapers, including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, and &quot;The Times&quot; of London, condemning Dole&#x27;s action, joined by radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Don Imus. Under the pressure, Dole admitted during an October 1995 press briefing on Capitol Hill that he regretted the decision to return the check, and that his campaign was responsible for it without consulting him. &quot;I think if they&#x27;d have consulted me, we wouldn&#x27;t have done that, wouldn&#x27;t have returned it,&quot; Dole said. Dole later told &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor and author Bob Woodward that the LCR episode was a &quot;mistake&quot; because the decision to return the check &quot;gets into Bob Dole the person. It&#x27;s not so much about Bob Dole the candidate. It&#x27;s the person. Is he tolerant? Does he tolerate different views? Tolerate someone with a different lifestyle?&quot; He added, &quot;This is basic, this is what people ought to know about you. Are you going to just do this because it sounds good politically?&quot;

LCR&#x27;s leadership met with Dole&#x27;s coalitions manager to discuss an endorsement after Dole&#x27;s reversal. Among various items, Tafel demanded there be no gay bashing in the speeches from the podium of the 1996 Republican National Convention, nor any anti-homosexual signs on the convention floor. He also wanted to see a gay person address the convention and a public request from Dole&#x27;s campaign for the LCR nod. On the closing night of the convention, Stephen Fong, then-president of the San Francisco chapter, spoke at the dais as part of a series of speeches from &quot;mainstreet Americans,&quot; but was not publicly identified as gay. Nevertheless, his presence on the podium for the organization and for the gay and lesbian community &quot;was something that would have been unimaginable four years earlier,&quot; Tafel later wrote. Fong was the first openly gay speaker at a Republican National Convention.

Two days later, Dole spokesperson Christina Martin told a reporter that the campaign &quot;welcomed the endorsement of the Log Cabin Republicans.&quot; LCR voted to endorse Dole for President, and then-Republican National Committee chairman Haley Barbour approved the use of the RNC&#x27;s press briefing room for Tafel, LCR&#x27;s convention delegates and officers of its national board to announce their decision.

Later in the campaign, Tafel met with Dole&#x27;s chief aide Sheila Burke, and the remaining demands LCR made for their endorsement were met. In a statement released by LCR, and confirmed to reporters by the campaign, Dole had pledged to maintain an executive order prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal workforce and full funding for AIDS programs.

===2000 presidential election===
The group endorsed George W. Bush in 2000.

===2004 presidential election===
Due to his support of the Federal Marriage Amendment, the group declined to endorse the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004. The proposed amendment would have constitutionally defined marriage as exclusively between one man and one woman. Bush&#x27;s defense of the FMA led the group to vote 22 to 2 against an endorsement of his reelection. The Palm Beach County chapter in Florida did endorse him, resulting in the revocation of their charter.

===2008 presidential election===
In September 2008, LCR voted to endorse the John McCain–Sarah Palin ticket in the 2008 presidential election. LCR President Patrick Sammon said the most important reason for their support was McCain&#x27;s opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

===2012 presidential election===
On 23 October 2012, LCR officially endorsed Mitt Romney despite Romney&#x27;s commitment to a constitutional amendment barring gays and lesbians from marriage nationwide and his objection to the repeal of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; policy on military service. In a public statement, LCR said it supported Romney due to the &quot;gravity of the economic and national security issues currently at stake&quot;. Moreover, LCR expressed its hope that Romney would reconsider his opposition to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, but he did not.

===2016 presidential election===
On October 22, 2016, the board members of LCR voted not to endorse the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump. In defiance, the LCR statewide chapters of Colorado, Georgia, and Texas, along with the LCR countywide chapter of Orange County, California and the LCR city chapters of Houston, Texas; Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; and Cleveland, Ohio; voted to endorse Donald Trump.

Nationwide, exit polls estimated that Trump received the lowest percentage of the LGBT vote by any Republican presidential candidate since the metric was first included in presidential polls in 1992. Trump received only 14% of the LGBT vote, a significant decline from Mitt Romney who received 22% in 2012. On November 9, 2016, the national LCR congratulated Donald Trump on his victory.

===2020 presidential election===

In November 2018, Jerri Ann Henry became the first woman to serve as Log Cabin executive director. A month later, she said in a television interview that, while she perceived Trump as having been &quot;vocally supportive&quot; of LGBT people compared to other Republican presidents and presidential candidates, there had nevertheless been &quot;a lot of ups and downs in the last two years with some of the administration&#x27;s actions.&quot;

On August 16, 2019, more than a year prior to the election, the Log Cabins endorsed Trump. Chair Robert Kabel and vice chair Jill Homan gave their reasons for the endorsement in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed. Three women resigned in protest: board member Jennifer Horn (who earlier in the year had served as campaign manager for Trump&#x27;s 2020 primary challenger Bill Weld), Log Cabin&#x27;s first woman board member Sarah Longwell, and executive director Jerri Ann Henry.

NBC exit polls found that 27% of LGBT voters chose Trump.

=== 2024 presidential election ===
In April 2024, Melania Trump was the guest of honor at a Log Cabin Republicans fundraiser in Mar-a-Lago, raising over $1 million according to organizers. This launched the Log Cabin &quot;Road to Victory&quot; program to reach voters in swing states and marked a rare appearance by Melania Trump at a political event. In July, she hosted a second LCR fundraiser at Trump Tower, raising $1.4 million. For the April appearance, Trump was paid $237,500 but the Log Cabin Republicans denied that they made the payment. An anonymous source told CNN that former first Trump Administration official Ric Grenell made the payment. As of September 2024, it was not known if Trump was paid for the July appearance.

A fundraising event organized by Log Cabin Republicans was held on 22 October 2024 in Charlotte, North Carolina—a state considered to be one of the battleground states in the 2024 election. The event was promoted as supporting the LGBT community within the Trump campaign. However, reports following the event indicated that there were no rainbow flags present, a symbol of the LGBT community that is normally prominent in events in support of it. Speakers at the event rejected calls for equality as &quot;victim mentality&quot;, and instead insisted that the LGBT community has already reached equality. Headliners at the event included Richard Grenell, who was the first openly gay person to serve in the Cabinet, as well as Lara Trump.

NBC exit polls found that 13% of LGBT voters chose Trump.

==&quot;Log Cabin Republicans v. United States&quot;==

A lawsuit filed by LCR in federal court challenging the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; (DADT) policy, which excluded homosexuals from openly serving in the U.S. military, went to trial on July 13, 2010, presided by Judge Virginia Phillips. LCR argued that the policy violates the rights of homosexual military members to free speech, due process and open association. The government argued that DADT was necessary to advance a legitimate governmental interest. LCR introduced several admissions by President Barack Obama, including that DADT &quot;doesn&#x27;t contribute to our national security,&quot; &quot;weakens our national security,&quot; and that reversing DADT is &quot;essential for our national security&quot;. Rather than address plaintiff&#x27;s claims or bring evidence to support their own claims of national interest, the government relied exclusively on the policy&#x27;s 1993 legislative history.

On September 9, 2010, Phillips ruled in favor of plaintiffs, finding that DADT violates the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

On September 29, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court&#x27;s decision, ruling that the legislative repeal of &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; by President Barack Obama and the outgoing Democratic congressional majority in December 2010 rendered the case moot. The dismissal left the lower court ruling without value as precedent.

==Platform==
LCR acts under the statement: &quot;We are loyal Republicans. We believe in limited government, strong national defense, free markets, low taxes, personal responsibility, and individual liberty. Log Cabin Republicans represents an important part of the American family—taxpaying, hard working people who proudly believe in this nation&#x27;s greatness. We also believe all Americans have the right to liberty and equality. We believe equality for LGBT Americans is in the finest tradition of the Republican Party. We educate our Party about why inclusion wins. Opposing gay and lesbian equality is inconsistent with the GOP&#x27;s core principles of smaller government and personal freedom.&quot;

On social issues, LCR either dissents from social conservatism or is neutral. On matters relating to gay and lesbian rights, LCR advocates for same-sex marriage and tax equity for domestic partner benefits. The LCR website also includes an &quot;Equality Map&quot; giving information on state laws in areas from employment discrimination and relationship recognition to hate crimes protections and anti-bullying laws.

===Abortion===
LCR takes no official position on abortion.

===National defense===
On the issue of national defense: &quot;Log Cabin Republicans believe in a confident foreign policy and a strong national defense. As the world&#x27;s sole military superpower, it is vital that the United States remain ready and able to shoulder its responsibilities in the global arena while standing as a beacon of freedom. Log Cabin Republicans call attention to the cruel and abusive treatment of gays and lesbians worldwide, particularly as it coincides with authoritarian regimes renowned for supporting terrorism and disregarding other basic human rights.&quot;

===Transgender rights===
Nationally, LCR argues that transgender people, alongside gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, should have the right to adopt and to be free of workplace and housing discrimination. They support decriminalization of being transgender worldwide. In 2017, the LCR asked Donald Trump to reinstate Obama-era protections for transgender students, including freedoms to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity.

However, in the early 2020s, some local chapters took positions against transgender rights. The New Hampshire and Texas chapters support laws that &quot;out&quot; transgender youth to their families and refuse gender-affirming care to youth. In 2022, members of the San Antonio chapter joined an armed protest of a Christmas-themed drag show at the Aztec Theatre (though LCR&#x27;s president, Charles Moran, said he had no knowledge of the chapter&#x27;s involvement). Moran, when Florida&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay&quot; bill was being drafted, advised the sponsor against requiring teachers to inform parents that their children may be gay or transgender. However, he otherwise agreed with the DeSantis administration&#x27;s actions to restrict children&#x27;s access to information about LGBT people.

In 2023, the Virginia chapter of the Log Cabin Republicans supported Governor Glenn Youngkin&#x27;s LGBTQ+ policies, with LCR president Charles Moran endorsing &quot;common-sense protections for biological women&quot; and alleging that a &quot;radical gender theory&quot; is being taught in schools and must be opposed. This move was criticized by local LGBTQ+ advocacy group Equality Virginia.

When the Human Rights Campaign issued a state of emergency for the LGBT community, Moran condemned the HRC, citing Biden&#x27;s signing of a law supporting same-sex marriage as an argument for why LGBT people were not currently in danger. In this statement, Moran spoke derisively of trans liberation, stating that, &quot;the HRC is destructively redefining support for the LGBT community around trans surgeries for minors, biological men competing in women&#x27;s sports, and sex and gender identity lessons in kindergarten.&quot;

According to historian, Neil J. Young, most LGBT Republicans do not identify as &quot;LGBTQ&quot;, but simply as lesbian, gay or bisexual as they believe that &quot;LGBTQ has become a political identity rather than a sexual identity&quot;. As such, Log Cabin Republicans does not use the &quot;Q&quot; when calling themselves an &quot;LGBT Republican organization&quot;, there is also reportedly a large amount of infighting going on within the organization about whether they should also drop the &quot;T&quot;.

==Criticism==
LCR has been criticized for failing to promote Republican principles. Focusing on &quot;the battle for gay and lesbian civil rights&quot; at its March–April 2005 convention and Liberty Education Forum National Symposium, panel topics included &quot;Corporate Diversity&quot;; &quot;Family Fairness&quot;; and &quot;Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?&quot; This caused two &quot;Washington Post&quot; opinion columnists to say that &quot;the Log Cabin Republicans are looking less and less Republican.&quot; As of 2022, the Texas GOP Convention has refused to allow the LCR to have a booth at the convention for at least twenty years. The state party&#x27;s position has been criticized by Donald Trump Jr and by Richard Grenell.

In 2012, the Log Cabin Republicans were criticized by advocates of gay rights and marriage equality for endorsing Republican candidates who advocated new limitations on the legal rights of gay Americans as well as the retention of current discriminatory laws and policies.

Some in the LGBT community have expressed dissatisfaction with LCR, viewing it as a centrist organization that does not represent LGBT economic conservatives. In 2009, two former LCR members, Christopher R. Barron and Jimmy LaSalvia, formed GOProud to represent LGBT economic conservatives and libertarians; it was dissolved in 2014.

LCR president Greg Angelo described the &quot;preservation of LGBT rights and support for the LGBT community&quot; as hallmarks of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 Presidential campaign, and asserted that support would continue during his presidency. On that same day as these comments were made, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the Trump administration had rescinded Obama-era guidance on transgender students&#x27; rights. David Badash, editor-in-chief and founder of the &quot;New Civil Rights Movement&quot; has criticized LCR for not opposing this action. In 2017, Angelo described Trump as &quot;the most pro-LGBT Republican president in history.&quot; In a February 2018 interview, he said that Trump recognizes marriage equality as the &quot;settled law of the land, sent a letter of congratulations and commemoration [on Log Cabin&#x27;s 40th anniversary], and has people in his Cabinet who support marriage equality.&quot; Angelo therefore concluded that &quot;Trump is even &quot;better&quot; for the LGBTQ community than former President Barack Obama&quot;.

LCR&#x27;s decision to include straight conservative Isabella Riley Moody as an &quot;outspoken ambassador&quot; for the group was questioned due to Moody&#x27;s homophobic rhetoric. After stating in an interview that the LCR&#x27;s statement of principles &quot;really just grosses me out and makes me want to vomit&quot; and posting on Twitter that &quot;being ‘gay and proud’ is itself GROOMING,&quot; her name was removed from the group&#x27;s website.

<text>There are various names of God, many of which enumerate the various qualities of a Supreme Being. The English word &quot;god&quot; (and its equivalent in other languages) is used by multiple religions as a noun to refer to different deities, or specifically to the Supreme Being, as denoted in English by the capitalized and uncapitalized terms &quot;God&quot; and &quot;god&quot;. Ancient cognate equivalents for the biblical Hebrew &quot;Elohim&quot;, one of the most common names of God in the Bible, include proto-Semitic &quot;El&quot;, biblical Aramaic &quot;Elah&quot;, and Arabic &quot;ilah&quot;. The personal or proper name for God in many of these languages may either be distinguished from such attributes, or homonymic. For example, in Judaism the tetragrammaton is sometimes related to the ancient Hebrew &quot;ehyeh&quot; (&quot;I will be&quot;). It is connected to the passage in in which God gives his name as (), where the verb may be translated most basically as &quot;I am that I am&quot;, &quot;I shall be what I shall be&quot;, or &quot;I shall be what I am&quot;. In the passage, YHWH, the personal name of God, is revealed directly to Moses.

Correlation between various theories and interpretation of the name of &quot;the one God&quot;, used to signify a monotheistic or ultimate Supreme Being from which all other divine attributes derive, has been a subject of ecumenical discourse between Eastern and Western scholars for over two centuries. In Christian theology the word is considered a personal and a proper name of God. On the other hand, the names of God in a different tradition are sometimes referred to by symbols. The question whether divine names used by different religions are equivalent has been raised and analyzed.

Exchange of names held sacred between different religious traditions is typically limited. Other elements of religious practice may be shared, especially when communities of different faiths are living in close proximity (for example, the use of Khuda or Prabhu within the Indian Christian community) but usage of the names themselves mostly remains within the domain of a particular religion, or even may help define one&#x27;s religious belief according to practice, as in the case of the recitation of names of God (such as the japa). Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s Jaap Sahib, which contains 950 names of God is one example of this. &quot;The Divine Names&quot;, the classic treatise by Pseudo-Dionysius, defines the scope of traditional understandings in Western traditions such as Hellenic, Christian, Jewish and Islamic theology on the nature and significance of the names of God. Further historical lists such as &quot;The 72 Names of the Lord&quot; show parallels in the history and interpretation of the name of God amongst Kabbalah, Christianity, and Hebrew scholarship in various parts of the Mediterranean world.

The attitude as to the transmission of the name in many cultures was surrounded by secrecy. In Judaism, the pronunciation of the name of God has always been guarded with great care. It is believed that, in ancient times, the sages communicated the pronunciation only once every seven years; this system was challenged by more recent movements. The nature of a holy name can be described as either personal or attributive. In many cultures it is often difficult to distinguish between the personal and the attributive names of God, the two divisions necessarily shading into each other.

== Abrahamic and related religions ==
=== Judaism ===
El comes from a root word meaning &quot;god&quot; or &quot;deity&quot;, reconstructed in the Proto-Semitic language as &quot;&quot;. Sometimes referring to God and sometimes the mighty when used to refer to the God of Israel, El is almost always qualified by additional words that further define the meaning that distinguishes him from false gods. A common title of God in the Hebrew Bible is Elohim (Hebrew: ). The root &quot;Eloah&quot; () is used in poetry and late prose (e.g., the Book of Job) and ending with the masculine plural suffix &quot;-im&quot; creating a word like &quot;ba`alim&quot; (&#x27;owners&#x27;) and &quot;adonim&quot; (&#x27;lords&#x27;, &#x27;masters&#x27;) that may also indicate a singular identity.

In the Book of Exodus, God commands Moses to tell the people that &#x27;I AM&#x27; sent him, and this is revered as one of the most important names of God according to Mosaic tradition.

In , when Moses first spoke with God, God said, &quot;I used to appear to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as El Shaddai, but I did not make myself known to them by my name YHWH.&quot;

YHWH () is the proper name of God in Judaism. Neither vowels nor vowel points were used in ancient Hebrew writings and the original vocalisation of YHWH has been lost.

Later commentaries additionally suggested that the true pronunciation of this name is composed entirely of vowels, such as the Greek . However, this is put into question by the fact that vowels were only distinguished in the time-period by their very absence due to the lack of explicit vowels in the Hebrew script. The resulting substitute made from semivowels and glottals, known as the tetragrammaton, is not ordinarily permitted to be pronounced aloud, even in prayer. The prohibition on misuse (not use) of this name is the primary subject of the command not to take the name of the Lord in vain.

Instead of pronouncing YHWH during prayer, Jews say &quot;Adonai&quot; (&#x27;Lord&#x27;). &quot;Halakha&quot; requires that secondary rules be placed around the primary law, to reduce the chance that the main law will be broken. As such, it is common religious practice to restrict the use of the word &quot;Adonai&quot; to prayer only. In conversation, many Jewish people, even when not speaking Hebrew, will call God &quot;HaShem&quot; (), which is Hebrew for &#x27;the Name&#x27;; this appears in .

Almost all Orthodox Jews avoid using either Yahweh or Jehovah altogether on the basis that the actual pronunciation of the tetragrammaton has been lost in antiquity. Many use the term &quot;HaShem&quot; as an indirect reference, or they use &quot;God&quot; or &quot;The Lord&quot; instead. Mark Sameth argues that Yahweh was a pseudo name for a dual-gendered deity, the four letters of that name being cryptogram which the priests of ancient Israel read in reverse as , &#x27;he–she&#x27;, as earlier theorized by Guillaume Postel (16th century) and (19th century).

=== Christianity ===

In Christianity, the Old Testament reveals YHWH (; often vocalized with vowels as &quot;Yahweh&quot; or &quot;Jehovah&quot;) as the personal name of God. References, such as &quot;The New Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, affirm the vocalization &quot;Yahweh&quot; by offering additional specifics to its (Christian) reconstruction out of Greek sources:
Early Christian writers, such as Clement of Alexandria in the 2nd century, had used a form like Yahweh, and claim that this pronunciation of the tetragrammaton was never really lost. Other Greek transcriptions also indicated that YHWH should be pronounced Yahweh.

Jah or Yah (rendered as in Hebrew) is an abbreviation of Jahweh/Yahweh/Jehovah. It appears in certain translations of the Bible, such as the Revised Standard Version, and is used by Christians in the interjection Hallelujah, meaning &quot;Praise Jah&quot;, which is used to give Jahweh glory. In Christianity, certain hymns dedicated to God invoke the divine name using the vocalization Jehovah (, ), such as &quot;Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah&quot;.

The Hebrew personal name of God YHWH is rendered as &quot;the &quot; in many translations of the Bible, with Elohim being rendered as &quot;God&quot;; certain translations of Scripture render the Tetragrammaton with Yahweh or Jehovah in particular places, with the latter vocalization being used in the King James Version, Tyndale Bible, and other translations of the Bible from that time period and later. Many English translations of the Bible (such as ESV, NIV, KJV, etc.) translate the tetragrammaton as , thus removing any form of YHWH from the written text and going well beyond the Jewish oral practice of substituting Adonai for YHWH when reading aloud.

English Bible translations of the Greek New Testament render (Greek: ) as God and (Greek: ) as &quot;the Lord&quot;, with the latter being the &quot;Greek translation of the Hebrew OT name for God, Yahweh.&quot;

Jesus (Iesus, Yeshua) was a common alternative form of the name ( &#x27;Joshua&#x27;) in later books of the Hebrew Bible and among Jews of the Second Temple period. The name corresponds to the Greek spelling , from which comes the English spelling &quot;Jesus&quot;. &quot;Christ&quot; means &#x27;the anointed&#x27; in Greek (). is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word &quot;Messiah&quot;; while in English the old Anglo-Saxon Messiah-rendering (&#x27;healer&#x27;) was practically annihilated by the Latin , some cognates such as in Dutch and Afrikaans survive—also, in German, the word is sometimes used as reference to Jesus, e.g., in church chorals).

In the Book of Revelation in the Christian New Testament, God, that is, Jesus is quoted as saying &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End&quot;. (cf. , , and )

Some Quakers refer to God with the title of the Light. Another term used is King of Kings or Lord of Lords and Lord of Hosts. In addition to the personal name of God YHWH (pronounced with the vocalizations Yahweh or Jehovah), titles of God used by Christians include the Hebrew titles Elohim, El-Shaddai, and Adonai, as well as Ancient of Days, Father/Abba which is Hebrew, &quot;Most High&quot;. &quot;Abba&quot; (&#x27;father&#x27; in Hebrew) is a common term used for the creator within Christianity because it was a title Jesus used to refer to God the Father.

==== Mormonism ====

In Mormonism the name of God the Father is Elohim and the name of Jesus in his pre-incarnate state was Jehovah. Together, with the Holy Ghost they form the Godhead; God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Mormons typically refer to God as &quot;Heavenly Father&quot; or &quot;Father in Heaven&quot;.

Although Mormonism views the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as three distinct beings, they are one in purpose and God the Father (Elohim) is worshipped and given all glory through his Son, Jesus Christ (Jehovah). Despite the Godhead doctrine, which teaches that God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost are three separate, divine beings, many Mormons (mainstream Latter-day Saints and otherwise, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) view their beliefs as monotheist since Christ is the conduit through which humanity comes to the God the Father. The Book of Mormon ends with &quot;to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the eternal Judge of both the quick and dead. Amen.&quot;

==== Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ====
Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that God has a distinctive name, represented in the Old Testament by the Tetragrammaton. In English, they prefer to use the form &quot;Jehovah&quot;. According to their &quot;New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures&quot;, the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; means &quot;He causes to become&quot;.

Though scholars prefer the form &quot;Yahweh&quot;, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses maintain that the name &quot;Jehovah&quot; is the most well known form in English. Their literature compares the use of the form &quot;Jehovah&quot; in English to the widespread use of &quot;Jesus&quot; in English as a translation of or .

=== Islam ===

Allah—meaning &#x27;the God&#x27; in Arabic—is the word for God in Islam. The word &quot;Allah&quot; has been used by Arabic people of different religions since pre-Islamic times. More specifically, it has been used as a term for God by Muslims (both Arab and non-Arab) and Arab Christians. God has many names in Islam. The Qur&#x27;an says (in translation) &quot;to Him Belong the Best Names ()&quot;; examples include &quot;Ar-Rahman&quot; (&#x27;the Entirely Merciful&#x27;) and (&#x27;the Especially Merciful&#x27;). Beside these Arabic names, Muslims of non-Arab origins may also sometimes use other names in their own languages to refer to God, such as &quot;Khuda&quot; in Persian, Bengali and Urdu. or &quot;Tengri&quot; was used in the Ottoman Turkish language as the equivalent of Allah.

==== Sufism ====
In Tasawwuf, often characterised as the inner, mystical dimension of Islam, Hu, (depends on placement in the sentence), or &quot;Parvardigar&quot; in Persian are used as names of God.

The word explicitly appears in many verses of the Quran:
=== Baháʼí Faith ===

The scriptures of the Baháʼí Faith often refer to God by various titles and attributes, such as Almighty, All-Possessing, All-Powerful, All-Wise, Incomparable, Gracious, Helper, All-Glorious, and Omniscient. Baháʼís believe the Greatest Name of God is &quot;All-Glorious&quot; or in Arabic. is the root word of the following names and phrases: the greeting &quot;&quot; (&#x27;God is the All-Glorious&#x27;), the invocation (&#x27;O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious&#x27;), (&#x27;the Glory of God&#x27;), and (&#x27;Follower of the All-Glorious&#x27;). These are expressed in Arabic regardless of the language in use (see Baháʼí symbols). Apart from these names, God is addressed in the local language, for example in Hindi, in French and in Spanish. Baháʼís believe Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, is the &quot;complete incarnation of the names and attributes of God&quot;.

===Mandaeism===
Mandaeans believe in one God called (&#x27;The Great Life&#x27; or &#x27;The Great Living God&#x27;). Other names for God used include (&#x27;Lord of Greatness&#x27;), (&#x27;The Great Mind&#x27;), (&#x27;King of Light&#x27;) and (&#x27;The First Life&#x27;).

===Gnosticism===
==Egypt==

A divine name is an official title for any divine being. In Egypt, divine names were indicated with a god&#x27;s inscription (&quot;nṯr&quot;, which can be Anglicised as &quot;netjer&quot;.) In Sumerian cuneiform, the &quot;Dingir&quot; sign (𒀭) was used. 
A divine being&#x27;s name is distinct from an epithet. A divine epithet expresses specific traits, aspects, or domains of a god, or applies a common noun to them. Rahmouni says a locative name is &quot;ʔil yṯb bʕṯtrt &quot;in KTU 1.108, 2 meaning &quot;The god who sits (enthroned) in ʕAṯtartu.

A name is sometimes double-barreled, like in Shagar-we-Ishtar or Kothar-wa-Hasis.

ʔṯrt w rḥmy Asherah-wa-Rachmai takes this (&quot;binomial&quot;) form but is of slightly unclear categorization. In this case and that of the Lady of Byblos, it is not clear if the appellation is a personal name.

Binomial names can be found in &quot;bound forms&quot; like Bethel&#x27;s Anat-Bethel, Ashim-Bethel, &quot;and Herem-Bethel from the archives of Elephantine.&quot;

In one Egyptian story, the sun god Ra&#x27;s true name was cunningly uncovered by Isis. Using a secret scheme, Isis gained complete dominion over Ra. This enabled her to elevate her son Horus to the throne, showing the power that a name had over the gods. 
=== Appendages ===
The maiden goddesses of Canaan and Phoenicia were sometimes called the &quot;name of the lord&quot; (Ba&#x27;al) or the &quot;face of the lord.&quot; In their less-virginal incarnations as the consort Anat-Bethel or as a mother goddess ʕtr [ʕ-t-r-m = ʕtr-(ʕ)m(y) &quot;ʕtr my mother&quot;] these and &quot;hand of&quot; the deity are added. This might mean hypostasis or intercession.

* &quot;Brahman&quot; () is a theological concept espoused in Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, which is of neuter gender. The word () popularly pronounced as () is also used synonymously with it. The word is used to denote the Supreme Divinity/Supreme Soul.
* &quot;Isvara&quot; () shortened as () is applied to mean &#x27;God&#x27; in both religious and secular context (for example in the Gita, Arjuna is referred to as which is a compound of the two words , &#x27;human&#x27; and , thus the word means &#x27;God of humans&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;king&#x27;). The term (&#x27;Supreme God&#x27;) is used to refer to one&#x27;s (chosen deity for personal veneration) in general terms. The feminine equivalents are () and () used in case of female deities.

=== Arya Samaj ===

===Jainism===

Jainism rejects the idea of a creator deity responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have always existed. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and an immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Jainism offers an elaborate cosmology, including heavenly beings (&quot;s&quot;), but these beings are not viewed as creators; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.

Jains define godliness as the inherent quality of any soul characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, perfect knowledge and perfect peace. However, these qualities of a soul are subdued due to karmas of the soul. One who achieves this state of soul through right belief, right knowledge and right conduct can be termed as god. This perfection of soul is called &quot;kaivalya&quot; (omniscience). A liberated soul thus becomes a god – liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, &quot;karmas&quot; and finally liberated of body as well. This is called &quot;nirvana&quot; or &quot;moksha&quot;.

If godliness is defined as the state of having freed one&#x27;s soul from karmas and the attainment of Kevala Jnana and a god as one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods/&quot;Tirthankara&quot;. Thus, Rishabhanatha was god/ but he was not the only ; there were many other . However, the quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them.

Jainism does not teach the dependency on any supreme being for enlightenment. The is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one&#x27;s own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the cosmos; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is called as observing the &quot;Mahavrata&quot; (&#x27;Great Vows&#x27;).

Gods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as &quot;Tīrthankaras and Arihantas&quot; or ordinary &quot;Kevalis&quot;, and non-embodied formless gods who are called &quot;Siddhas&quot;. Jainism considers the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;s&quot; to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve .

===Sikhism===

There are multiple names for God in Sikhism. Some of the popular names for God in Sikhism are:
* &quot;Akal Purakh&quot;, meaning &#x27;timeless being&#x27;.
* &quot;Ik Onkar&quot;, &#x27;One Creator&#x27;, found at the beginning of the Sikh Mul Mantar.
* &quot;Nirankar&quot;, meaning &#x27;formless&#x27;.
* &quot;Satnam&quot;, meaning &#x27;True Name&#x27;; some are of the opinion that this is a name for God in itself, others believe that this is an adjective used to describe the , .
* &quot;Waheguru&quot;, meaning &#x27;Wonderful Teacher bringing light to remove darkness&#x27;; this name is considered the greatest among Sikhs, and it is known as , &#x27;the Guru&#x27;s Word&#x27;. is the only way to meet God.
* or , meaning &#x27;the Giver&#x27;.
* or , meaning &#x27;the Doer&quot;&#x27;.&quot;
* , meaning &#x27;compassionate&quot;&#x27;.&quot;
* , meaning &#x27;benevolent&quot;&#x27;.&quot;

In the Sikh scripture, both Hindu and Muslim names of the Supreme Being are also commonly employed, expressing different aspects of the divine Name. For instance, names like Ram (&#x27;pervading&#x27;), Hari (&#x27;shining&#x27;), Parmeshwar (&#x27;supreme lord&#x27;), and (&#x27;world lord&#x27;) refer to Hindu terms, while names like Allah (Arabic for &quot;God&quot;), Khuda (Persian for &quot;God&quot;), Rahim (&#x27;merciful&#x27;), Karim (&#x27;generous&#x27;), and Sahib (&#x27;lord&#x27;) are of Muslim origin.

God, according to Guru Nanak, is beyond full comprehension by humans; has an endless number of virtues; takes on innumerable forms, but is formless; and can be called by an infinite number of names thus &quot;Your Names are so many, and Your Forms are endless. No one can tell how many Glorious Virtues You have.&quot;

The word &quot;Allah&quot; () is used 12 times in the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; (primary religious scripture) by Sheikh Farid. Guru Nanak Dev, Guru Arjan Dev and Bhagat Kabeer used the word 18 times.

<text>Riverdale station (also known as Riverdale–West 254th Street station) is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, serving the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City. The Riverdale station, located at the foot of West 254th Street, is the northernmost Metro-North station in the Bronx. As of August 2006, daily commuter ridership was 543 and there were 153 parking spaces.

==History==
The former New York Central Railroad depot at the location burned down on the morning of June 23, 1982, after a suspicious fire, requiring two trains to bypass the station.

In 1991 the Hudson Rail Link opened as a feeder bus service operated by Atlantic Express to connect the Riverdale neighborhood to the Metro-North station. The Hudson Rail Link is now operated by Consolidated Bus Transit after Atlantic Express declared bankruptcy in 2014.

The Riverdale Waterfront Promenade was inaugurated in 2005 by mayor Michael Bloomberg, created to improve riverside access to local residents. Access to the park is only through the station.

Under the 2015–2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority Capital Plan, the station, along with four other Metro-North Railroad stations, received a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates included cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories, and maps. The renovations at Riverdale station cost $9.5 million and were completed by the end of September 2018.

==Station layout==

The station has two high-level, side platforms, each eight cars long. There are two middle tracks without platform access. An additional fifth track (called track 6) is located west of the southbound platform, but is not powered nor used. Just south of the station are switches that allow Empire Corridor trains to diverge to Pennsylvania Station via the Empire Connection and Spuyten Duyvil Bridge.

Next to the station&#x27;s southbound platform lies the Riverdale Waterfront Promenade and Fishing Access Site. The park is wide and long.&quot;

<text>Smokey Stover is an American comic strip written and drawn by cartoonist Bill Holman from March 10, 1935, until he retired in 1972 and distributed through the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. It features the misadventures of the titular fireman.

==Overview==

===Background===
Holman was born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and moved to Chicago, where he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts while working as an office boy in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; art department. He relocated to New York City where he worked as a staff artist at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and submitted freelance cartoons to magazines, including &quot;Colliers&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Judge&quot;, and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. He began &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; as a Sunday comic strip for the Chicago Tribune Syndicate on March 10, 1935. The daily comic strip began on November 14, 1938.

===Characters and story===
The madcap situations in Holman&#x27;s comic strip usually feature Smokey (short for &quot;Smokestack&quot;) Stover, the &quot;foolish foo (fire)fighter&quot;, often riding in his self-balancing, two-wheeled &quot;Foomobile&quot; (a single-axle fire engine which resembles a modern Segway with seats, or an independent sidecar), his wife Cookie, his son Earl, his boss Chief Cash U. Nutt, the Chief&#x27;s wife Hazel Nutt and the firehouse Dalmatian mascot, Sparks. Smokey has an array of eccentric relatives who are also featured occasionally, with names like &quot;Uncle Potbelly Stover&quot;, &quot;Rusty Stover&quot; and &quot;Cousin Cole Stover&quot;.

Smokey wears bright red (or yellow) rubber boots and a firefighter&#x27;s helmet (always worn back-to-front), which he sometimes ties to his nose with string, in lieu of a chinstrap. His trademark helmet also features a prominent hole in its hinged brim, which he occasionally uses as an ashtray for his lit cigar. Although most of the sequences in the strip (and the occasional comic book) center on Smokey&#x27;s escapades with the Chief, the loose &quot;plots&quot; and situations are mainly a framework to display an endless parade of off-the-wall verbal and visual humor.

===Puns and &quot;wallnuts&quot;===
The panels of &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; regularly include sight gags, mishaps, absurd vehicles, and bizarre household items, including oddly shaped furniture, clocks, vases, headwear, cigarette holders, and telephones. Framed pictures on the walls change completely from panel to panel or feature the subjects literally jumping out of the frames. The strip also abounds in nonsensical dialogue, non-sequiturs, and puns.

The puns and silly pictures on the wall was the feature that provoked the most reader mail, according to articles and interviews with Holman. The cartoonist often visited the syndicate office to pick up the puns which readers suggested for the walls. He called these items &quot;wallnuts&quot;. For example, a picture of a fish opening a door is labeled &quot;calling cod&quot;.

===Jocular jargon and peculiar phrases===

The comic strip featured signs with strange nonsense words and phrases, such as &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;notary sojac&quot;, &quot;scram gravy ain&#x27;t wavey&quot;, and &quot;1506 nix nix&quot;, and some became catchphrases. Holman defined &quot;notary sojac&quot; as Gaelic for &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; (Nodlaig Sodhach), and &quot;1506 nix nix&quot; was reportedly a private joke that included the hotel room number of cartoonist Al Posen, Holman&#x27;s friend. His most frequent nonsense word was &quot;foo&quot;, and Holman peppered his work with foo labels and puns. The term spread in popular culture during the 1930s and found use in 1938–39 Warner Brothers cartoons, most notably by director Bob Clampett, including &quot;Porky in Wackyland&quot;. Harvey Kurtzman claimed that the comic influenced him to use nonsense words and fill the corner panels of MAD Magazine with &quot;nonsensical details&quot;.

Smokey &quot;often called himself a &quot;foo fighter&quot; when anyone else would have said &quot;firefighter&quot;&quot;, according to comics historian Don Markstein. &quot;The word &quot;foo&quot; also turned up on signs, lists, menus, and the lips of various characters at random but frequent intervals.&quot; Foo may have been inspired by the French word &quot;feu&quot; meaning &quot;fire&quot;, as Smokey&#x27;s catch phrase was &quot;where there&#x27;s foo, there&#x27;s fire&quot;, but Holman never gave a straight answer as to the origin. Holman states that he used the word due to having seen it on the bottom of a jade Chinese figurine in Chinatown, San Francisco, meaning &quot;good luck&quot;. This is presumably a transliteration of the fu character (fú, 福), which is a common character for fortune, and figurines are common in Chinese communities featuring the &quot;star god&quot; &quot;Fú, Lù, Shòu&quot;.

===Foo fighters===
During World War II, images of Smokey Stover and Spooky were painted as nose art on several American bomber aircraft. The term &quot;foo&quot; was borrowed directly from &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; by a radar operator in the U.S. 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who it is agreed by most 415th members gave the &quot;foo fighters&quot; their name. The term was used by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II to describe various unidentified flying objects or mysterious aerial phenomena seen in the skies over both the European and Pacific Theaters of Operations. Though &quot;foo fighter&quot; initially described a type of UFO reported and named by the 415th Squadron, the term was also commonly used to mean any UFO sighting from that period.

Foo Fighters is also the name of a rock band, first heard in 1995. Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release recordings under the title &quot;Foo Fighters&quot;, taken from the World War II term for UFOs and indirectly from Holman&#x27;s strip.

==Related strips==
===&quot;Spooky&quot;===
Holman launched an accompanying topper strip called &quot;Spooky&quot; one month later (April 7, 1935), to run with &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; on Sundays. With a perpetually bandaged tail, the peculiar black cat Spooky lives with his owner Fenwick Flooky, who does embroidery while characteristically wearing a fez and sitting barefoot in a rocking chair. Holman used the pseudonym &quot;Scat H.&quot; to sign the strip. The topper ran until the strip ended in 1972.

===&quot;Nuts and Jolts&quot;===
Spooky, who makes frequent cameo appearances in &quot;Smokey Stover&quot;, also regularly turns up in the background of Holman&#x27;s daily gag panel feature, &quot;Nuts and Jolts&quot;. Syndicated for more than three decades from July 8, 1935, to 1970, &quot;Nuts and Jolts&quot; was a stand-alone panel cartoon featuring an ever-changing cast of everyday people doing silly things.

==Comic books and reprints==
There were several &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; comic books published by Dell Comics Four Color. The first in this series, No. 7 (1942), displayed an unusual front cover of a full seven-panel sequence, a rarity in comic book covers. The next in the Dell series, No. 35 (1944), was followed by No. 64 (February 1945), No. 229 (May 1949), No. 730 (October 1956) and No. 827 (August 1957). (Cartoonist Hy Eisman has said he drew the Smokey Stover content in Four Color No. 730.) In 1953–54, Holman produced two public services giveaway comic books on fire safety, both published by the National Fire Protection Association.

==Animation and oddities==
*A novelty song based on &quot;Smokey Stover&quot;—&quot;What This Country Needs Is Foo&quot;, with words and &quot;FOOsic&quot; by Mack Kay—was recorded by Eddie DeLange and His Orchestra on Bluebird Records in 1939. Holman illustrated the cover for the sheet music, released by Joe Davis, Inc. Music Publishers.
*In 1941, Bill Holman gave his blessing to The Order of Smokey Stover, a social club created by the Redmond Volunteer Firefighters Association in Redmond, Oregon.
*In 1953, Pittsfield, Massachusetts, firefighters William J. Knight and Walter J. Pictrowski designed and built a three-wheeled version of Smokey Stover&#x27;s Foo Mobile. With permission and suggestions from Holman, the vehicle was adorned with familiar paraphernalia, such as a rubber-handled ax, a fire call box, a fire gong, crank handle and steam-generating radiator cap (a fire nozzle with the slogan &quot;Sea-Oh-Too!&quot;). The Foo Car has been in and out of service over the years and has been restored twice, brought back for appearances at Berkshire area parades, musters and charity events. It is currently garaged.
*In 1971, &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; was a featured segment on Filmation&#x27;s &quot;Archie&#x27;s TV Funnies&quot;, the only animated form of this comic. &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; became one of several rotating segments on the Saturday morning cartoon series. Other comic strip character features in the rotation included &quot;Broom-Hilda, Dick Tracy, The Captain and the Kids, Emmy Lou, Nancy and Sluggo&quot; and &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;. It was repeated in 1978, without &quot;Archie&quot;, under the title &quot;Fabulous Funnies&quot;.
*&quot;Smokey Stover&quot; is referenced in &quot;Jumbeliah&quot;, an unreleased song Bruce Springsteen wrote in his early career: &quot;Built like Marilyn Monroe, and she walks just like Smokey Stover.&quot;
*In the 1980s, Gateway Scientific Inc. produced a line of smoke alarms marketed under the &quot;Smokey Stover&quot; brand name, with the packages featuring his likeness.
*Pete Schlatter of Francesville, Indiana constructed a workable single-axle, two-wheel Foomobile by hiding four support wheels inside the two wheels.
*In 2001, Dark Horse Comics issued a limited edition figure of Smokey Stover in a colorful collector tin, as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters—designated as statue No. 21.

<text>King Kobra is an American heavy metal band founded by drummer Carmine Appice after his tenure with Ozzy Osbourne from 1983 to 1984.

==History==
For their first two albums, the band consisted of four relatively unknown musicians: vocalist Marcie Free, guitarist David Michael-Philips, guitarist Mick Sweda, and bassist Johnny Rod. After two albums on Capitol Records—&quot;Ready to Strike&quot; (November 9, 1985) and &quot;Thrill of a Lifetime&quot; (1986)—and the independent release &quot;King Kobra III&quot; in 1988, Appice decided to dissolve the band and join guitarist John Sykes for his Blue Murder project in 1989.

A new King Kobra emerged in 2010 with Carmine Appice on drums, Paul Shortino taking over vocal duties, Mick Sweda on guitar, David Henzerling (a.k.a. David Michael-Philips) on guitar, and Johnny Rod on bass. This lineup released the self-titled album &quot;King Kobra&quot; in 2011 on Frontiers Records and another album in 2013, titled &quot;King Kobra II&quot;.

The band went on hiatus following the release of their 2013 album, largely due to the other commitments of the individual band members, They played live gigs again in 2016 without Mick Sweda.

On July 18, 2023, the band announced their new album, &quot;We Are Warriors&quot;, will be released on August 11. The title track was also released as a single. The line up features new guitarists Carlos Cavazo and Rowan Robertson, formerly of Quiet Riot and Dio respectively.

<text>Spuyten Duyvil station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, serving the Spuyten Duyvil neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City.

, daily commuter ridership was 913 and there were 100 parking spots. More than half of the commuters travel to the station using the Hudson Rail Link bus.

== History ==
=== Fires and vandalism ===
Through the 1950s and the 1960s, the New York Central Railroad depot at Spuyten Duvyil was subject to frequent vandalism. Throughout this time period, multiple stations were also subjected to fires, including Marble Hill (1951 and 1960) and Mount Saint Vincent stations (1957). The railroad let the station depots at Spuyten Duyvil be subject to damage, with the windows on the wooden structure boarded up and broken. The depot was always locked and only staff was an employee to sell monthly commutation tickets. There were complaints about the stairways being closed, requiring people to cross the tracks. Vandalism was also common, along with common crimes such as burglary. Someone stole the oil heater from the depot in 1956. The southbound depot caught fire in 1956 as well.
The railroad tried to sell the northbound depot in 1957 for uses other than a railroad station, but no one took advantage.

On July 29, 1957, the station caught fire at 7:20 a.m. The New York Central suspended service along the Hudson Division. The fire was under control by 8:44 a.m., but the railroad congestion took a while to be handled. More than 5,000 people were delayed from work to the damage. The damage to the station included the station depot, parts of the platform and parts of the stairway. The repairs were finished in August 1957. Locals wanted some changes in how buildings are maintained after the fire in July 1957, noting that the railroad did not even patrol the area to keep people from destroying the depot. In December 1957, the railroad razed the northbound depot, with all operations shifted to the southbound depot, rebuilt from the 1956 fire.

Yet another fire broke out on the morning of April 19, 1966. This fire engulfed more of the platform and the stairs leading down to the platform. However, this time, the fire department had trouble reaching the station due to poor parking by commuters and had to spend time getting the hoses down from nearby Johnson Avenue to fight with. The fire lasted 40 minutes and held up three trains. The railroad made quick repairs to ensure clean service on April 20.

However, the station depot burned for good on June 29, 1969, when the southbound station depot and the downtown platform caught fire once again. Around 2:30 p.m. that afternoon, the station building walls and platform. The platform itself had suffered a fire on June 24, taking out of the structure. The fires delayed some Penn Central Railroad trains, but not many due to a smaller Saturday schedule. Despite extinguishing both fires, no one could answer the source of the blaze. A lean-to that was built for Spuyten Duyvil burned down in the winter of 1958–1959. Despite that, a building was constructed for the maintenance crews to use, leaving the commuters exposed to the elements. This included using the stairs as shelters for rain. The railroad put up two three-sided &quot;chicken coop&quot; shelters for commuters to use, to their displeasure. The residents put up signs referring to the shelters as &quot;&#x27;roosters&quot; and &quot;hens&quot; to voice their displeasure.

Local pressure led to some bowing from the New York State Public Services Commission in February 1970, who promised the commuters a new, larger shelter above their heads at the station. The new structure would include infrared heaters to keep the commuters warm. However, that was not the end of the fires at Spuyten Duyvil. The northbound platform, the scene of multiple fires, burned down once again on July 21, 1970. This fire leveled the wooden northern platform.

=== Accidents ===

In 1882, a local train of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad collided with a stopped express a mile south of the station, killing eight, including New York State Senator Webster Wagner, found crushed between two luxury sleeper cars built by his company.

In July 2013, two trains derailed near the station. A freight train hauling garbage lost nearly half its cars between Spuyten Duyvil and Marble Hill, requiring four days to clean up before one of the tracks could be reopened. In December 2013, a passenger train derailment north of the station resulted in four passenger deaths (the first in the railroad&#x27;s history) and 75 injuries.

==Station layout==
The station has two high-level platforms. Northbound trains utilize an eight-car-long side platform, while southbound trains use a four-car-long island platform. Directly east (railroad south) of the station, Track 4 merges with Track 2. Directly west (railroad north) of the station, Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Corridor services merges with the Hudson Line.

Originally, a wye existed at this station, connecting the current Track 4 with the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge. This was used by Hudson River Railroad and later New York Central trains, however passenger service ended in 1916. However, the wye track remained extant as late as 1998, but had been removed by 2011, according to topographic maps.

<doc id="561748" wikidata="Q1200932" url="?curid=561748" title="New Georgia Sound">
<text>New Georgia Sound is the sound in the New Georgia Islands region that runs approximately southeast–northwest through the middle of the Solomon Islands archipelago in the Southern Pacific Ocean and Melanesia.

==Geography==
The sound is bounded by Choiseul Island, Santa Isabel Island, and Florida Island to the north, and by Vella Lavella, Kolombangara, New Georgia, and the Russell Islands to the south. Bougainville Island of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (Papua New Guinea) and Guadalcanal island, define northwestern and southeastern ends of the sound, respectively.

It is one of three major routes for merchant shipping through the Solomon Islands archipelago. The two others are: the Bougainville Strait and Indispensable Strait route which links the Pacific Ocean, Solomon Sea and Coral Sea; and the Manning Strait route, which links the Pacific to New Georgia Sound.

Savo Island, a volcanic cone northwest of Guadalcanal, is a topographically significant island in the eastern region.

==History==
New Georgia was so named by John Shortland, who passed through New Georgia Sound in command of four ships of the First Fleet on their return voyage from Port Jackson in August 1788.

Captain Edward Manning sailed &quot;Pitt&quot; through the sound in 1792, on his way to Bengal in British India after having delivered convicts to Port Jackson in New South Wales, colonial Australia.

===World War II===
During the Pacific War of World War II, the New Georgia Sound was known as &quot;The Slot&quot; by Allied combatants due to its geographical shape and the amount of warship traffic that traversed it. The Japanese naval efforts to resupply their garrison on Guadalcanal were referred to as the Tokyo Express. A large number of naval battles were fought in and around the sound during 1942 and 1943, between the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the allied forces of the United States Navy, Royal Australian Navy, and Royal New Zealand Navy.

<text>Marble Hill station is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, serving the Marble Hill neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The station is located at 125 West 225th Street, two blocks west of the Broadway Bridge on the north side of the Harlem River, near the New York City Subway&#x27;s Marble Hill–225th Street station (which serves the ).

The Marble Hill station is frequently used by commuters going to and from the Manhattan neighborhoods of the Upper West Side, Washington Heights, Hudson Heights and Inwood; about a third of the station&#x27;s daily ridership disembarks at Marble Hill to transfer to the subway.

Marble Hill used to be one of four express stations on the Hudson Line south of Croton–Harmon; most trains stopped there, except for peak-hour trains to and from Poughkeepsie. However, , the only express trains that stop there are a few reverse peak trains in the morning, though most trains originating in or terminating at Croton do stop at the station.

==History==
Prior to the construction of the Harlem River Ship Canal, the Hudson Line went around Marble Hill, and the nearest station was a station in the Bronx named Kingsbridge, which was also the name of a nearby station on the New York and Putnam Railroad. Between 1905 and 1906 the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad realigned the tracks along the north coast of the canal and built Marble Hill station on the east side of the Broadway Bridge. As with the rest of the stations along the Hudson Line, the station became a Penn Central station upon the merger between NYC and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968. Penn Central continued commuter travel until it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, which at some point, moved the station to the west side of the bridge before the station and commuter line was taken over by Metro-North Railroad in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station has one narrow, 4-car-long high-level island platform accessible by enclosed stairway from West 225th Street.

Until the late 1970s the station lay east of the Broadway Bridge with two low-level side platforms serving a four-track line, providing a more direct connection to the bridge sidewalk via a short flight of steps. However, the current location west of Broadway is closer to the residential section of Marble Hill and the downtown platform of the subway. The former northbound express track was removed.

<doc id="561763" wikidata="Q145706" url="?curid=561763" title="Megascolecidae">
<text>Megascolecidae is a family of earthworms native to Madagascar, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and North America. At up to 2 meters in length, their large size distinguishes the Megascolecidae from other earthworm families. They are an essential part of maintaining soil structure, minor carbon sequestration, and maintaining terrestrial ecosystems.

== Physiological features ==
Different species of the Megascolecidae have different physiological features, but some similarities of physiological features can be found between species. The family contains relatively large individuals. The length of earthworms can vary from to . The number of spermathecal pores is normally paired, but multiples can be present in some species. The location of spermathecal pores and how they are positioned in different segmental locations is used in the identification of different megascolecidids.

Earthworms ingest a variety of organic materials in the soil since they live in terrestrial environments. Earthworms in this family have the ability to decompose lignocellulose, which requires assistance from microorganisms in their digestive system. Aside from microorganisms, digestive enzymes such as amylase and cellulase, and proteins can be found in different regions of the gut. Chemical digestion mainly occurs in the intestinal caeca of earthworms, which have higher protease activity than other parts of the gut.

Genital markings in the Megascolecidae family can be used to distinguish species.

== Reproductive system ==
The Megascolecidae are oviparous, laying eggs to reproduce. They are biparental. The ideal condition of reproduction for the megascolecidids is 25 °C, where the eggs hatch the quickest and have the highest cocoon production.

The male reproductive organ of the Megascolecidae includes testes, seminal vesicles, spermathecae, prostate glands, and spermathecal pores. The sperm can be found in testes and seminal vesicles, but cannot be found in spermathecae. The female reproductive organ consists of female pores, which normally occur in pairs. Both male and female reproductive organs are present in earthworms because they are monoecious. To breed, two earthworms exchange sperm. Long after they are separated, the egg case is secreted. It forms a ring around the worm, then the worm removes the ring from its body and injects its own eggs and the other worm&#x27;s sperm into it. Afterwards, the egg case is sealed and ready to hatch, grow, and become a cocoon.

== Lifecycle ==
The Megascolecidae lifecycle takes around 50–57 days, depending on the external environments and habitat. The rate of growth during the first 14 days is very low, however; after 21 – 28 days, the rate of growth increases and then cycles up and down throughout the worm&#x27;s life with no pattern. The growth rate of these worms is correlated to the temperature of their environment. As temperatures increase from 30 °C, a significant growth rate and decreasing the time to sexual maturity are seen. The ideal living temperature of megascolecidids is around 15 to 30 °C. Overall mean growth is 1.79 mg/day, 1.57 mg/day, and 1.34 mg/day depending on the abundance of worms and environment condition and size. The cocoon production of Megascolecidae species also is correlated with the temperature of the environment.

==Distribution and habitat==
Megascolecidae species can be in Australia, New Zealand, Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. The intercontinental presence of Megascolecidae species can be explained by the Permanence of Continent Theory, which provides the explanation of most Cenozoic distributions; this theory,though, does not explain the presence of European Megascolecidae in North America. The intercontinental distribution of Megascolecidae has two different theories that explains its phenomenon -land bridges and continental drift.

The Megascolecidae family originated in Australia. Australia has number of species that are native to different parts of the country; &quot;Anisochaeta sebastiani&quot; is an example. This species can be found from Queensland to Tasmania. Fifty-three known species of these earthworms can be found in Western Australia; &quot;Graliophilus georgei&quot; and &quot;G. secundus&quot; are some examples. &quot;G. zeilensis&quot; can be found in the Northern Territory, specifically in Mount Zeil, West MacDonnell Ranges. &quot;G. zeilensis&quot; also can be found on the highest point of the mountain where average rainfall of the region is 250 mm annually. This distinguishes them from other species from &quot;Graliophilus&quot;.

&quot;Metaphire&quot; and &quot;Amynthas&quot; are two common genera belonging to the Megascolecidae family. They can be found in different countries in Asia.

Eight different species of &quot;Metaphire&quot; can be found in Malaysia: &quot;M. sedimensis, M. hijaunensis&quot;, &quot;M..e songkhlaensis, M. pulauensis&quot;, &quot;M. pulauensis&quot;, &quot;M. fovella&quot;, &quot;M. balingensis&quot;, and &quot;M. strellana&quot;. These species are commonly found in soil containing medium to high organic material. such as loamy soil.

In Indonesia, 9 different genera can be found; &quot;Amynthas&quot;, &quot;Archipheretima&quot;, &quot;Metaphire&quot;, &quot;Metapheretima&quot;, &quot;Pheretima&quot;, &quot;Pithemera&quot;, &quot;Planapheretima, Pleinogaster&quot;, and &quot;Polypheretima.&quot; &quot;Pheretimoid&quot; is the biggest group of species, which consists of 65 species. Some intrageneric groups are restricted to mainland Asia, but others are native to Indo-Australian Archipelago.

The ideal habitat for Megascolecidae is a terrestrial environment with soil with a high content of organic material, such as loamy soil, cattlebor pig manure, and aerobically digested sewage sludge. Megascolecidae species grow and produce more cocoons during the summer than the winter, because their lifecycle is highly correlated to the temperature and humidity of the environment. Some Megascolecidae species have adapted to colder temperatures and drier areas, though, which enables them to live in higher-altitude regions of the land.

== Ecology ==
Megascolecidae form an important part of the soil ecosystem, in that they indicate soil health and maintain soil productivity. The abundance of earthworms is highly correlated to soil pH, texture, water content, and temperature. Earthworms have the ability to biomonitor soil pollutants. This is because of earthworms&#x27; burrowing habit serves to facilitate water flow and agrochemicals through the soil profile, so are able to perform carbon sequestration and reduce soil pollutants]. Invasive earthworms can have a significant impact causing changes in soil profiles, nutrient and organic matter content and other soil organisms or plant communities. In most cases the disturbed areas includes agricultural systems or previously areas that are lacking of earthworms would see the biggest impact of the invasive earthworms. The impact of earthworms on soil structure is due to the rate of net nitrogen mineralization.

<text>University Heights station (also known as the University Heights–West 207th Street station) is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, serving the University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City.

The station located between the Harlem River and the Major Deegan Expressway. Access to the platform is via a staircase from the pedestrian walkway on the south side of University Heights Bridge. It is also near the Roberto Clemente State Park.

==History==
The station has operated since the days of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad as well as the New York and Putnam Railroad late in the 19th century, though not in its present form. It was originally located north of the former 180th Street (now Osbourne Place), while a nearby Fordham Heights station was located at West Fordham Road. At some point before the 1920s, the two stations were merged, although demolition of the Fordham Heights Station was being planned as early as 1906. North of Fordham Road, the former NY&amp;P branched off to the northeast on its way to Brewster.

Throughout much of the 20th Century, University Heights station contained a station house over the tracks along the south side of West Fordham Road. As with many NYCRR stations in the Bronx, the station became a Penn Central station upon the merger between NYC and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1968. Penn Central continued commuter service and began tearing the station house down in 1975, before until it was taken over by Conrail in 1976, which turned the station over to Metro-North Railroad in 1983.

==Station layout==
The station has one 4-car-long high-level island platform accessible by stairway or elevator from West Fordham Road.

<text>Morris Heights station (also known as Morris Heights–West 177th Street station) is a commuter rail stop on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line, serving the Morris Heights neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City.

The station is located in the narrow strip of land between the Major Deegan Expressway and the Harlem River, next to Roberto Clemente State Park. It is also located across from the Dr. Roland N. Patterson School complex, which was built over the tracks between the bridges for Harlem River Park Drive and West Tremont Avenue.

The station has operated since the days of the Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad as well as the New York and Putnam Railroad late in the 19th century, though not in its present form.

==Station layout==
The station has one narrow, four-car-long high-level island platform accessible from West Tremont Avenue (West 177th Street).

<text>The Lockheed Martin X-44 MANTA (Multi-Axis No-Tail Aircraft) was an American conceptual aircraft design by Lockheed Martin that has been studied by NASA and the U.S. Air Force. It was intended to test the feasibility of full yaw, pitch and roll authority without tailplanes (horizontal or vertical). Attitude control would rely purely on 3D thrust vectoring. The aircraft design was derived from the F-22 Raptor and featured a stretched delta wing without tail surfaces.

== History==

NASA and the U.S. Air Force had begun preliminary work on the aircraft by May 1999. Plans called for MANTA technologies to be demonstrated on either an F-22 Raptor or F-15. An X-44 prototype would begin test flights by fiscal year 2007. NASA planners stated that developing technologies for the X-44 could have application to the F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter programs and commercial supersonic ventures.

Initial feasibility work was funded by government and two contractors. NASA approved the program to start in June 1999, giving the aircraft the designation &quot;X-44A&quot;. Funding for the X-44 ended in 2000. Some of the subsequent FB-22 proposals had considered having no tailplanes and would have continued the research from the MANTA program.

==Design and development==

Planning documents called for an aircraft that &quot;leapfrogs state-of-the-art.&quot; The X-44 was designed by Lockheed Martin to demonstrate the feasibility of an aircraft controlled by vectored thrust alone. The X-44 design had a reduced radar signature (due to lack of tail and vertical stabilizers) and was made more efficient by eliminating the tail and rudder surfaces, and instead using thrust vectors to provide yaw, pitch and roll control.

The X-44 MANTA design was based on the F-22. The engine and fuselage would be carried over to the X-44. Major differences included the delta wing shape and tail-less design. Plans called for the elimination of flight control surfaces. Yaw, pitch and roll authority would be accomplished through thrust-vectoring, possibly by modifying the extant 2-D vectoring nozzles of the F-22. These changes would in effect be combining the control and propulsion systems. The X-44 MANTA would have a greater fuel capacity than the F-22, due to its larger delta wing design. The MANTA was designed to have reduced mechanical complexity, increased fuel efficiency and greater agility.

<text>King Kobra III, released in 1988 on New Renaissance Records, was the first and last album by the Edwards, Michael-Phillips, Northrup, Hart and Appice line-up of King Kobra. After the demise of the original line-up, remaining members Carmine Appice and David Michael-Phillips teamed up with Johnny Edwards, Jeff Northrup and Larry Hart, all 3 members of the Sacramento, CA band Northrup at the time.

The album featured a strong selection of 1980s style mainstream metal. However, a lack of album sales resulted in the dissolution of the band. Bassist Johnny Rod, who appeared on the first two albums as bassist, does not play here. However, he does contribute backing vocals.

The model posing on the album cover is Carmine&#x27;s then wife, Sarah Appice, who also makes a cameo appearance in the &quot;Take It Off&quot; promotional video.

<text>Harlem–125th Street station is a commuter rail stop serving the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson, Harlem, and New Haven Lines. It is located at East 125th Street and Park Avenue in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. The station also serves as an important transfer point between the Metro-North trains and the New York City Subway&#x27;s IRT Lexington Avenue Line () for access to the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It is the only station besides Grand Central Terminal that serves all three lines east of the Hudson River. Trains leave for Grand Central Terminal, as well as to the Bronx and the northern suburbs, regularly.

The station was constructed along the Park Avenue main line of the New York Central Railroad.

==History==

The current station was built in 1896–97 and designed by Morgan O&#x27;Brien, New York Central and Hudson River Railroad principal architect. It replaced an earlier one that was built in 1874 when the New York Central and the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, the ancestors of today&#x27;s Metro-North, moved the tracks from an open cut to the present-day elevated viaduct. The original station on the site was built in 1844, when the trains ran at grade-level on what is now Park Avenue. That station was demolished to make way for the open cut.

In 1888, the United States Department of War began work on the Harlem River to allow for unrestricted shipping activity between the Hudson River and the East River and through the new Harlem River Ship Canal at 225th Street. To remedy the situation, the Central opted to raise the bridge to above the water for $300,000. Due to political pressure, it had to raise the grade of its line north of 115th Street on a viaduct, raising the project&#x27;s cost significantly. The Park Avenue Line&#x27;s grade had to be raised to reach the higher bridge, and as a result, a new four-track steel viaduct was built between 132nd Street and 106th Street. Between 110th Street and 106th Street, the steel viaduct was to be placed atop the preexisting masonry retaining walls and fill. Between 115th Street and 130th Street, the viaduct was set to replace the open cut structure completed in 1875. Since the line was to be raised on a viaduct, the stone viaducts and the bridges crossing it could be removed. The 110th Street, 125th Street and Mott Haven stations were to be elevated as part of the project. The railroad had threatened to eliminate the 125th Street stop after neighboring property owners threatened to sue and successfully delayed construction.

On October 15, 1897, a spacious new station in Harlem was opened at 125th Street, replacing a small station in the old Park Avenue open cut located between 125th Street and 126th Street. The new station was built atop the old open cut and directly under the new Park Avenue Viaduct. The station was higher than the old one. The platforms, which were built on the viaduct, were built to be long. Unlike the old station, which was a local stop, the new station was constructed with two island platforms to allow express trains to stop, with the local tracks curving outwards to make room for them. The station was designed by architect Morgan O&#x27;Brien, and consisted of three levels: the basement containing a section of the old cut not filled in, a waiting room at street level, and the elevated platforms. The original station platforms were discovered in the basement level in 1988 as the station was set to be renovated.

As with many NYCRR stations in New York City, the station became a Penn Central station once the NYC &amp; Pennsylvania Railroads merged in 1968. The New Haven Line and its branches would be acquired by Penn Central a year later, thus making it a full Penn Central station. Penn Central&#x27;s continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. After the 138th Street in the Mott Haven section of the South Bronx was closed by Penn Central in 1972, 125th Street Station was the northernmost station to be shared by the Hudson and Harlem Lines. The station and the railroad were turned over to Conrail in 1976, and eventually became part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)&#x27;s Metro-North Railroad in 1983.

On April 14, 1986, Metro-North awarded a $500,000 contract to URS Inc. to design a renovation of the station. At the time, it was expected that the renovation would repair the station&#x27;s leaky roof, install new windows, lighting, and doors, and replace its dilapidated platforms. URS was expected to issue a preliminary report on the condition of the wooden station structure and the steel viaduct, and on short- and long-term plans to rehabilitate the station. At the time, weekday ridership at the station was 420 on the Hudson Line, 500 on the Harlem Line, and 670 on the New Haven Line.

A six-year-long renovation of the 1897 structure was completed in 1999 and cleared out a century&#x27;s worth of neglect and deterioration. The entire Park Avenue viaduct was replaced piece-by-piece without disturbing Metro-North service for the duration of the renovation. This reconstruction included the removal of the Nick Tower just south of the station. The Nick Tower was a control tower mounted over the tracks spanning the entire right-of-way. The renovation is considered a replication, rather than renovation, of the original 1930s version of the station being that none of the original structure is visible to the public.

Under the 2015–2019 MTA Capital Plan, the station, along with four other Metro-North Railroad stations, would receive enhancements as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates would include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories, and maps.

==Service==
The station is used for travel to and from suburbs north of New York City and the Bronx rather than travel to and from Grand Central Terminal. All off peak and reverse peak trains to or from Grand Central Terminal stop at Harlem. It is in the same fare zone as Grand Central Terminal, so customers pay the same fare whether traveling to Harlem or Grand Central, and may use either station. Except for local Harlem and Hudson Line trains, northbound trains stop at the station only to receive passengers. Westbound New Haven Line trains and most inbound AM peak Harlem and Hudson Line trains stop only to discharge passengers. Other southbound Harlem and Hudson Line trains may leave five minutes early.

==Station layout==
There are two 10-car long high-level island platforms, each serving two tracks. All of the tracks passing through the Harlem–125th Street station are reversible and can serve trains going in either direction. During rush hours, three tracks are typically assigned to the peak direction, with the remaining track serving the reverse direction.

==Future development==

The south side of 125th Street below the station viaduct houses a long-abandoned former comfort station (restroom facility) and the block has long been a vacant lot attracting garbage. The New York City Economic Development Corporation announced in 2013 that they would work with a mix of public agencies and private developers to improve the area surrounding the station, long considered a blight on East 125th Street.

In 2015, a nonprofit organization consisting of local small businesses, property owners and stakeholders called NHEMA (now Uptown Grand Central) adopted this space as a NYC Department of Transportation community plaza, and ever since has programmed the space with activities including a year-round farmers market, pop-up shop featuring local small businesses, concerts, a mobile library and free exercise classes for the community.

Ridership at Harlem–125th Street station rose 55% between 2002 and 2013, much of which included reverse commuters—city residents accessing jobs in the suburbs.

Phase II of the Second Avenue Subway is currently slated to end below the Metro-North station, with the subway tracks continuing west below 125th Street. The line is being built deep to clear the double height Lexington Avenue Line.

<text>Midhurst () is a market town and civil parish in the Chichester District in West Sussex, England. It lies on the River Rother, inland from the English Channel and north of Chichester.

The name Midhurst was first recorded in 1186 as &quot;Middeherst&quot;, meaning &quot;Middle wooded hill&quot;, or &quot;(place) among the wooded hills&quot;. It derives from the Old English words &quot;midd&quot; (adjective) or &quot;mid&quot; (preposition), meaning &quot;in the middle&quot;, plus &quot;hyrst&quot;, &quot;a wooded hill&quot;.

The Norman St. Ann&#x27;s Castle dates from about 1120, although the foundations are all that can now be seen. The castle, the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Denis, together with South Pond, the former fish-pond for the castle, are the only three structures left from this early period. The parish church is the oldest building in Midhurst. Just across the River Rother, in the parish of Easebourne, is the ruin of the Tudor Cowdray House.

== Governance ==

=== National ===
The former Parliamentary Constituency of Midhurst is now an electoral ward of the Parliamentary Constituency of Arundel and The South Downs, and was previously part of the Parliamentary Constituency of Chichester represented in the House of Commons from 2017 to 2024 by Conservative MP Gillian Keegan.
Since the 2024 elections, it is now represented by Conservative MP Andrew Griffith.

=== Local ===
Midhurst is part of the Chichester District of West Sussex County, governed by the Chichester District Council and West Sussex County Council respectively. Midhurst is represented by two councillors on the Chichester District Council, both of them Liberal Democrats, Jess Brown-Fuller and Hannah Burton.

=== Parish ===

The Midhurst Town Council meets monthly and comprises 15 directly elected members. The May 2015 election was uncontested as there were 13 nominations for the 15 seats, and therefore 2 vacancies. Four of these were women (31%). Various changes have occurred since the election. The council is led by a chairperson nominated by the councillors from among themselves. The council is supported by a staff of two: the Town Clerk (and Responsible Finance Officer) and an Assistant Town Clerk. There are three Council Committees: Finance, Asset and Policy (meets monthly), Community and Environment (meets monthly) and Planning and Infrastructure, which has an advisory function only to the principal planning authorities (Chichester District Council and the South Downs National Park Authority) (meets fortnightly). The times and dates of meetings, the minutes of meetings and other information is available on the Town Council website.

The Midhurst Town Council organises a community street party every December on the first Friday of December, a Summer Street Party on the last Saturday of August, various events for families throughout the year and regular &#x27;Big Cleans&#x27;. The council is responsible for the town recreation ground and the town cemetery, and provides grants to various local clubs and organisations.

In 2014 the Town Council moved from its former offices in Capron House on North Street to the Old Library building on Knockhundred Row. The building is leased from the West Sussex County Council, with a view to its eventual purchase by the Town Council.

== Economy ==
Midhurst is a market town servicing its rural hinterland through many small businesses, shops, restaurants and cafes. Its primary economic activities, in terms of employment, are wholesale and retail businesses including motor mechanics, construction, hotels, food and drink and office administration. In 2011 it had a population of 4,914, comprising 2,434 households (average size 2 people) and 3,477 economically active residents. Of the 1,027 economically inactive residents, 673 (65.5 per cent) were retirees.

Between 1913 and 1985, the Midhurst Brickworks, famous for producing &quot;Midhurst White&quot; bricks, was situated close to the former Midhurst Common railway station.

There is an area of light industry in the south of Midhurst, between the Holmbush Estate and Little Midhurst.

== Culture and community ==
=== Culture ===
The Midhurst Music, Arts and Drama Festival (MADhurst) is an annual community event that brings together the creative, artistic &amp; musical talent of Midhurst. It takes place at multiple venues in and around Midhurst for ten days every summer, culminating on August Bank Holiday in a Carnival Parade (organised by the Town Council) and Grand Finale celebration with stalls, a music festival, clowns, food and more at the Midhurst Sports Ground. The programme for each festival varies from year to year, but typically includes evening and lunchtime concerts (classical, swing, folk and jazz), an art trail, an artisan fair, a &#x27;family fun day&#x27; for young children, theatre and dance performances, a local Gardeners Question Time, a short story competition and numerous workshops on creative skills, plus a range fringe events such as exhibitions, beer festivals, quiz nights, treasure trails and others. The event brings together the whole community to manage the box office, arrange workshops, help with PR and social media, provide security and everything needed for a smooth-running festival.

The Midhurst Medieval Festival takes place annually in the Old Town, in early May, featuring re-enactments, falconry, spinning and weaving demonstrations, have-a-go archery, medieval music, stalls and medieval food.

The architectural heritage of Tudor, Georgian and Victorian buildings in Midhurst is considerable, with 94 listed buildings. The Midhurst Society was founded in 1969 to help conserve this heritage. The Society aims to preserve, protect and improve local features of historic or public interest. It promotes high standards of planning and architecture and seeks to enhance the local environment and amenities, in liaison with public authorities. A biannual magazine &quot;Midhurst Magazine&quot; is published to encourage interest in the local past, present and future.

The Knockhundred Shuttles a Midhurst-based mixed Morris Dancing club, meets regularly to practice, and appears in numerous country festivals. The Midhurst Players present 3–4 amateur dramatic productions each year, the Midhurst Art Society and the Midhurst Camera Club each hold summer exhibitions each year, and the Midhurst Choral Society gives periodic recitals.

Filmography: In 2010 Midhurst featured as a set for the television series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;. In 2014 the Midhurst Together Group facilitated the community production of the &quot;Midhurst Happy Video&quot;, based on the original song by Pharrell Williams.

Social Media: The town has an internet presence with a Town Council website, a &quot;VisitMidhurst&quot; website focused on the information needs of tourists, a community Facebook page, Twitter feed and Pinterest page. About ten community organisations are also active on social media, and many of them have websites.

=== Community facilities ===

The South Downs National Park, established in 2011, stretches for between Winchester in the West to Eastbourne and Beachy Head in the East. It encompasses the whole of the South Downs, together with a significant area of the western Weald to the north of the Downs, as far north as Alice Holt near Farnham. The Park&#x27;s landscapes cover . The headquarters of the National Park Authority, the South Downs Centre in Capron House, Midhurst is a community hub, an exhibition about the National Park and a green conference centre. It also includes the Midhurst Tourist Information Centre.

The Midhurst Town Trust is a charity responsible for maintaining some of Midhurst&#x27;s community facilities. The Charity Commissioners Scheme for The Midhurst Town Trust was sealed on 4 February 1910, and has governed the activities of the Trust ever since, with one amendment. Certain properties were vested in the Trust to protect, administer and care for. In addition to the Old Town Hall and the Market Square, the commissioners schedule of property included the Stocks, The Pound, The Curfew Garden, the Royal Arms, Town Mace and Constables Staves. The Trustees meet twice a year. There are currently six trustees: one representative of the Lord of the Manor (Lord Cowdray); Three representatives of Midhurst Town Council; and two co-opted trustees who reside in Midhurst.

The Grange Leisure Centre was opened on 3 March 2014, replacing a nearby earlier building dating from the 1960s. It is owned by Chichester District Council and operated by Westgate Leisure. The centre provides a number of services under one roof. It is a meeting-place for a range of clubs, including bridge, badminton, gymnastics, toddlers, line-dancing, yoga and many others. It includes: a multi-purpose four-court sports hall; a fitness room with state of the art Technogym equipment; two squash courts and a squash viewing area; a dance studio with mirrors that is also used for fitness and community activities; a health suite, including a sauna, steam room and a spa pool; a multi-purpose community hall and community rooms; and a bar and café with Wi-Fi access. The facility overlooks South Pond, with an outdoor seating area.

Community health facilities are provided at the Midhurst Community Hospital in Dodsley Lane. The former Midhurst Sanatorium, founded by King Edward VII, closed in 2006 and has since been converted to housing.

Library: The local branch of the West Sussex County Library is housed in The Grange Leisure Centre.

Register Office: The Midhurst Branch of the West Sussex Register office is housed in The Grange Leisure Centre, and is open part-time for the registration of Births, Marriages and Deaths.

Clubs and Societies: There are over fifty clubs and societies in Midhurst, covering all aspects of community life. They include groups active in the arts and in crafting activities, in environmental and heritage activities, in social support and welfare activities and in sport and leisure.

== History ==
Midhurst developed as a Saxon village at a strategic crossroads of what are now the A272 (east-west) and A286 (north-south) routes. There may have been a village there since Roman times. After the Norman Conquest Robert de Montgomery ordered the building of a motte-and-bailey castle on what is now called St Ann&#x27;s Hill, a strategic bluff on a curve of the River Rother, overlooking the cross-roads and a long stretch of Rother Valley to the north, east and the west, protecting the River Rother crossing. St Ann&#x27;s Hill may also have been the site of an Iron Age fort

Although there has been a settlement in Midhurst since at least the early Norman period, and probably from Saxon times, the buildings in the Old Town, centred on the Market Square, are principally Tudor in origin. Almost every house in this part of the town dates back to the 16th Century, and parts of a few buildings, such as the old coaching inn that is now the Spread Eagle Hotel, date to the 15th century. Even the apparently more modern North Street is lined with Tudor buildings behind classical and Georgian façades that were added during the 17th and 18th centuries, a time of prosperity for the town. There are also several actual 18th-century buildings scattered throughout the town, and distinctive Victorian and Edwardian developments of terraced housing along the main routes out of Midhurst. During the mid and late 20th Century there was significant housing development to the south of the town, in the Little Midhurst, Holmbush and Fairway areas.

=== Manorial (pre-modern) period ===
In 1106 Savaric fitz Cana (Fitzcane) received land in Midhurst and the neighbouring village of Easebourne from Henry I, and in 1158 his son built a fortified manor house on St. Anne&#x27;s Hill. The family later adopted the de Bohun name, and in about 1280 abandoned the fortified manor house to build their principal home on flat land across the River Rother from St. Ann&#x27;s Hill, in the neighbouring parish of Easebourne, &#x27;at a place called Coudreye&#x27; (old French for a &quot;hazel grove&quot;). Between 1284 and 1311 St Ann&#x27;s Castle was in the hands of the Bishop of Durham, and during that period was largely dismantled.

However &quot;the chapel of St. Denis within the former castle of Midhurst&quot; appears to have escaped the destruction, as it was functioning in 1291, and is referred to in 1367 as standing &quot;in a place called Courtgrene&quot;. There is still a house called Court Green beside the current entrance to the castle enclosure. At some period after this date the chapel of St. Dennis was eventually demolished, and the re-built foundation can be seen within the castle curtain wall.

The parish church in Midhurst originated as a medieval chapel dedicated to St Mary Magdalene. In about 1216 the founding charter of a
college of priests at Easebourne (re-established about 1230 as a Benedictine nunnery), lists Midhurst amongst its dependent chapels. When Easebourne Priory was suppressed in 1536 and handed to the Fitzwilliam family, the chapel in Midhurst achieved parish church status, and was substantially re-built. The additional dedication of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene to St Denis (also the dedication of the former chapel within the castle) is first recorded in 1764.

The little town developed outside the castle, mainly to service it and the immediate surrounding area, and to provide a market place for local agricultural surpluses. It was bounded by an escarpment dropping in the north to the Town Meadow, in the east to the River Rother and in the South to a tributary to the Rother. To the west it was bounded until the late 12th century by a 1.5-metre deep ditch, with a dyke and pallisade, approximately where Duck (or Dyke) Lane now lies.

Other than the castle, the principal engine of growth for the town was its regular market, for which the earliest known reference is in 1223. Many of the early buildings were grouped around the market area. These houses were built of highly perishable materials, and none have survived. Most would have been about a perch wide (about 5 metres), with long gardens at the rear, opening onto back lanes. On market days country people would bring their produce to sell at stalls in the open air. Apart from foodstuffs, the principal trades were in wool, cloth and leather, and related trades such as weaving, whitening, quilt-making and cobbling. These were largely determined by the predominance of shepherding in the surrounding agricultural area.

Midhurst was a &#x27;free borough&#x27; and in 1278 was said to have been so from time beyond memory. It was governed by a bailiff who was elected by the burgesses from among themselves. The bailiff regulated the market by ensuring the assize of bread and ale, appointing two ale-tasters yearly, and acted as clerk of the market. Disputes over the respective rights and duties of town and manor were settled in 1409 by an agreement whereby Michael Bageley and six other named burgesses agreed, on behalf of themselves and their successors, to pay 40 shillings a year to Sir John de Bohun, Lord of the Manor, and his heirs, for the right to take the market tolls. In return they were required to hold both the three-weekly courts and to conduct two &#x27;law days&#x27; in the name of Sir John. If they failed for a whole year to hold the courts the agreement should lapse, and if they neglected to keep the streets and ditches in order the lord&#x27;s manorial officers should be responsible for apprehending offenders, but were required to hand over any fines to the burgesses. This arrangement was confirmed in 1537 by Sir William Fitzwilliam, after his purchase of the manor.

Midhurst was first represented in the Parliament of 1301 and was consistently represented from 1382 onwards. From these early beginnings, and until the Great Reform Act of 1832, the town had two members of parliament. The electors were the owners of certain properties, which were marked by &quot;burgage stones&quot;, one of these stones remains and can be seen with a descriptive plaque embedded in the wall of a building just north of the Old Library (Council Offices) on Knockhundred Row.

=== Early modern period ===

The event that had the greatest effect on the town in the Tudor period was the re-building of Cowdray House, which commenced in the 1520s. Sir David Owen, illegitimate son of Owen Tudor and uncle to Henry VII, began construction of the building that is now in ruins beside the River Rother, on the site of the former building called Coudreye, which he had acquired upon the death of his wife Mary Bohun. Her family had built the original house there between 1273 and 1284, after they abandoned their original castle on St Ann&#x27;s Hill. The rebuilding continued after 1529, when Sir David Owen&#x27;s son sold it to Sir William Fitzwilliam.

The Fitzwilliams were a staunch Catholic family, and remained so throughout the English Reformation and beyond, making Midhurst a centre of Catholicism into the 17th century. Nevertheless, the Fitzwilliams were courtiers who maintained generally good relationships with the royal family and benefitted from considerable enrichment during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, at its height between 1536 and 1538. They were therefore able to inject vast sums of money into the property and its mansion. Completed about 1540, the estate had a major impact on the local economy. Enormous amounts of food were required to feed the approximately 200 servants, huge numbers of family and visitors. About thirty separate dishes were served to anything up to 500 people at the main daily meal. Similarly, the building works themselves, using brick and stone rather than the locally produced materials of other local buildings at the time (typically timber framing infilled with wattle and daub), would have required vast amounts of transport, storage and accounting, bringing artists, craftspeople and specialists of many kinds to the town, driving the development of a local middle class. There are two wall paintings in the town said to have been painted by artists working on the mansion who were lodging in the houses concerned. One is in the building on North Street currently occupied by the Olive and Vine Restaurant and Bar, and the other is in Elizabeth House, beside the Swan Inn in Red Lion Street. They are thought to be either practice images for the work in the mansion, or painted in lieu of rent. The image in North Street tells the story of King Ahab robbing Nathan of his family vineyard, reflecting the despair that the mostly Catholic population of the town felt in being forbidden by the monarch to practice their religion.

The extension of the town along the former lane to Easebourne towards the new mansion, which had begun in the early 14th century with the building of the first mansion on the river-side site, now intensified. This contributed to the economic expansion, as merchants built new houses and shops on North Street to facilitate their dealings with Cowdray House. It was during this period that the Angel Hotel was built, as a coaching house in response to the growing travel. Fifty years later, it hosted many of the Pilgrim Fathers, on their way from London and East Anglia to Plymouth.

The local labour market was distorted as workers were diverted from their conventional tasks to work as servants or contribute to the building. Town officials were concerned at the redirection of the Midhurst economy away from its traditional centre around the market place and towards the newly dynamic Cowdray House. The bailiff and burgesses petitioned Sir Anthony Fitzwilliam to give them a plot of land on which to build a market house near the church, as a focus for commerce in the Old Town. This was built in the market square in 1551, and although much altered since, it probably looked similar to the market house currently at the Weald and Downland Museum, with open bays on the ground floor, and an upstairs room for official use.

In 1605, the owner of Cowdray House, Anthony-Maria Browne, 2nd Viscount Montagu, was briefly arrested in connection with the Gunpowder Plot. He was suspected as a plotter because of his Catholic religion and connections with several of the known plotters. Among others, he had briefly employed Guy Fawkes, a native of Lewes in East Sussex, as a footman. In addition he had stayed away from Parliament on 5 November following a warning from Robert Catesby, the leader of the plot. Anthony-Maria Browne spent about a year in the Tower of London, died in 1629 and is buried in Midhurst Church. Later in the 17th century, this influence began to wane. By 1621, there were about forty households of recusants in Midhurst. In 1634, one John Arismandy appointed John Cope and Richard Shelley to administer certain moneys after his death to provide a priest for the poor Catholics of Midhurst, to say masses every week for his soul and &#x27;my lords ancestors&#x27;. This deed was found in the 19th century in a box hidden in the chimney of an old house with rosaries and other religious objects.

In the mid-1630s, Sir Anthony Browne employed the fashionable cook, Robert May to be the chef at Cowdray House. In 1565, he published one of the earliest British cook-books – &quot;The Accomplisht Cook&quot;.

In 1637, an ecclesiastical court case records parishioners of Midhurst playing cricket during evening prayer on Sunday, 26 February (Julian), one of the sport&#x27;s earliest references.

By the mid-17th century, the Anglican church was well established and Catholicism apparently declining, although about a quarter of families remained Catholic, and 30 years later there were a similar proportion of Nonconformist families. In 1642, during the English Civil War, the &#x27;Protestation&#x27; in support of the Anglican Church was signed by 207 men in Midhurst, but 54 &#x27;recusant Papists&#x27; refused at first to sign it. Two days later 35 of these did sign, probably excepting the special clause denouncing the Roman Faith, as did their colleagues at Easebourne, where there was an equal number of recusants. By 1676, the estimated numbers of Conformists (Anglicans) was recorded as being 341, of Roman Catholics 56, and of Nonconformists 50.

=== Modern period ===
In 1831 there were only 41 eligible voters and Midhurst was considered a rotten borough. In the Great Reform Act of 1832 Midhurst was reduced to one Member of Parliament and the constituency was expanded to include most of the surrounding villages.

Cowdray House and estate was owned by the Montagu family until 1843, when it was bought by the 6th Earl of Egmont, who sold it in 1910 to Sir Weetman Dickinson Pearson who in 1917 became Viscount Cowdray. The current owner is the 4th Viscount.

There was a gasworks adjacent to the wharf just south of St. Ann&#x27;s Hill.

In 2002, Country Life magazine rated Midhurst the second best place to live in Britain, after Alnwick.

== Geology ==
Midhurst is situated in the Wealden Greensand that lies between the South Downs and the Low Weald: that is, between the open rolling chalklands of the Downs, and the sandstones and clays of the western Weald, exemplified by the densely wooded slopes, hills and steep valleys around and especially to the north of Midhurst. The solid geology in the vicinity of Midhurst is sedimentary rock, as throughout Sussex. Descending northwards from the South Downs through Midhurst towards the Weald, the rocks become progressively older. The historic core of the town lies almost entirely on the Sandgate Formation (or beds), which form part of the Lower Greensand Group (Lower Cretaceous) while the southern suburbs are built on the sandstones of the Folkestone Formation. The drift geology of the Midhurst area comprises alluvium following the course of the River Rother and its tributaries, together with associated river terrace deposits of gravels, sands and silts.

== Landmarks ==

South Pond is the second oldest structure in Midhurst, second only to St. Ann&#x27;s Castle: it is thought to have been dammed in the early 12th century as a fish-pond for the Castle. To the west the South Mill was in existence by 1284, and used initially to grind corn. In 1634 it was converted to a fulling mill, and in the mid-1800s it was converted again to leather production. The pond is prone to silting due to its underlying greensand geology, and has in recent years become polluted and lifeless, in large part due to over-population of ducks as a result of artificial feeding. The South Pond Group was established in 2012 to conserve and develop the area around the South Pond as a wildlife corridor. Activities include clearance parties, water quality monitoring, newsletters, talks and maintaining notice and interpretation boards. Major renovation works, involving dredging and establishing reed and waterplant beds to reconstitute the natural ecology, capable of supporting a full range of pond life, were undertaken in 2014– 2015, under the leadership of the South Pond Group with community support.

The Midhurst War Memorial is situated outside the Midhurst parish church at the confluence of Red Lion Street and Church Hill, adjacent to the Market Square. It occupies land donated to the town for this purpose by Major Harold Pearson. Mr. Percy Oliver (1885–1949), a local stonemason, was commissioned to build and carve the memorial in accordance with the design of Sir Ashton Webb, who also designed Admiralty Arch in London. The War Memorial was unveiled in 1923. It is aligned on the axis of the nave of the church and consists of a square pillar set upon a square plinth which stands on an octagonal base of two steps within a kerbed, cobbled area. It has been constructed from dressed sandstone, probably from a local quarry. The names of fifty men who fell during the First World War, together with their service or regiment, are inscribed on panels of limestone which have been fixed to the north and south faces of the pillar. In 1929 a proposal to install oak posts and chains was dropped due to cost. In April 1947 it was decided to add the names of the dead of World War II, and Mr Oliver was asked to fix a tablet to the War Memorial. However, it was not until 1960 that it was finally agreed to add these panels, and the work was completed in 1962. In 2014 the name of a Royal Marine killed in the Afghan War in 2012 was added to the plinth. The Memorial is in the care of the Town Trust. Each year on Remembrance Sunday, the Midhurst Branch of the Royal British Legion organises a service of remembrance at the War Memorial.

== Listed buildings ==
There are 106 buildings in Midhurst listed with Historic England as having special architectural or historic interest, while the earthworks and ruins of St. Ann&#x27;s Castle have been designated as a Scheduled Monument. The Parish Church of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Denis and the Spread Eagle Hotel are both listed Grade II*, while the remainder are Grade II. At least 42 of the listed buildings are in the Old Town. Of the listed buildings two recognisably predate 1500; six are 16th century; 30 are 17th century; 32 are 18th century; 22 are early 19th century; one is from 1841 to 1880; and one (a telephone box) is from 1914 to 1945. As this is a K6 model, introduced in 1935, it must date from the latest decade of this period.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Midhurst was linked by three lines, one from Pulborough in 1866, one from Petersfield in 1864 and one from Chichester in 1881. The line from Chichester to Midhurst closed in 1935 to passengers and in 1951 to goods traffic.

There were two stations, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway&#x27;s (Chichester to Pulborough) and the London and South Western Railway&#x27;s. All passenger services were concentrated on the LB&amp;SCR station in 1925 by the Southern Railway. The last passenger trains ran in 1955.The line remained open, from Pulborough only, for goods traffic until 1964.

=== Road ===
The A272 runs through the town east and west. The A286 runs through the town north and south.

The town is served by four regular bus routes. Stagecoach operate numbers 60 to Chichester, 70 to Guildford via Haslemere and 1 to Worthing via Petworth; Emsworth operate 92 to Petersfield via Rogate.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the nearby Midhurst TV transmitter situated northeast of the town. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sussex on 104.8 FM, Heart South on 97.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Sussex on 106.6 FM, and V2 Radio, a community online-based station. 

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Midhurst and Petworth Observer&quot;, published on Thursdays.

== Education ==
The secondary school in the town is Midhurst Rother College. It succeeds the former grammar school, founded in 1672. It is an Academy school formed following the closure of the grammar school and Midhurst Intermediate School in January 2009. In 2012/13 it was designated as &quot;outstanding&quot; by Ofsted. Girls were first admitted to the school in 1956.

There is a state primary school in Midhurst, the Church of England Primary School, in Ashfield Road. Other state primary schools in the catchment area include those of Easebourne and Stedham. In Easebourne there is also a private primary school, Conifers.

== Religious sites ==
The Midhurst Deanery is a Deanery of the Church of England comprising 22 churches in the Rother Valley between Midhurst and Petersfield.

The Anglican parish church is St Mary Magdalene and St Denys, in the market square. It is a listed building. The interior of the church has undergone much restoration and change and little evidence exists of its medieval heritage. Consisting of chancel and nave flanked by aisles on both sides, the church was largely rebuilt in the Perpendicular style in 1422, towards the end of Henry V&#x27;s reign. The base of the tower is 13th century. The tower top, south nave and chancel arcades are 16th century in the perpendicular style. The rest of the building is from 1882 or later.

The Roman Catholic parish church is the Church of the Divine Motherhood and St Francis of Assisi, on Bepton Road. It was built in 1957, replacing an earlier church on Rumbolds Hill, which was built in 1869 by C.A. Buckler in the early English style and is now part of the Wheatsheaf pub. The new building is of sandstone in the shape of a segment of a circle with the rounded off point forming an eastern apse. The western arc is divided into seven sections by vertical stone fins, six of which are glazed, leaving the doorway in the central section with a Madonna and Child above. There is a circular skylight above the altar. The stations of the cross are carved on a continuous stone band along the side walls. There is a tall separate bell tower linked to the church by an open colonnade.

Midhurst Methodist Church is a flint masonry building with brick quoins standing to the north of the old grammar school buildings. A large Gothic style west window looks towards the ruins of Cowdray House.

There is also a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses on Holmbush Way.

<text>&quot;The Royale&quot; is the twelfth episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, the 38th episode overall. It was originally released on March 27, 1989, in broadcast syndication.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, Riker, Data, and Worf become trapped in a strange hotel on a planet otherwise incapable of supporting human life.

== Plot ==
Following a tip from a Klingon ship, the Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, finds debris from an Earth ship orbiting an uninhabitable alien planet. A sample of the debris beamed aboard shows NASA markings and a 52-star American flag, dating the ship to the mid-to-late 21st century and establishing that it had traveled far beyond the capability of ships of that era. Scans of the planet reveal a small anomalous area capable of supporting human life, so Commander Riker, Lt. Worf, and Lt. Commander Data beam down to investigate, and find a revolving door standing alone in a dark void. Upon entering, they find themselves in an old Earth-style hotel and casino called The Royale, where they are cut off from contact with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

The away team soon discovers they are trapped inside the casino, and after making several unsuccessful attempts to leave, they decide to explore the building. In a hotel room, they find the desiccated but preserved remains of Col. Stephen Richey, a NASA astronaut, and a pulp novel entitled &quot;Hotel Royale&quot;. Upon reading Richey&#x27;s diary, they learn that his starship had launched in 2037, been accidentally contaminated by an unknown alien race, then transported through a wormhole across the galaxy; he was the only survivor. Taking pity on Richey, the aliens created The Royale for him, thinking the novel&#x27;s story represented humans&#x27; preferred way of living, whereas Richey found it unbearable thanks to the poor quality of the novel. He lived there for 38 years until his death, and his remains have been in the room for 283 years.

Riker, Data, and Worf realize that the plot has been recreated in detail by the aliens and is playing out around them, and surmise that they might be able to leave if the story dictates that they do so. They assume the role of a trio of foreign investors described in the novel, who eventually leave the hotel after buying it for $12.5 million. Data begins to play craps, using his winnings from an earlier visit to the blackjack table, but soon senses that the dice are loaded to favor the house. He compresses them in his hand to readjust their weight distribution in his favor, then goes on a winning streak that breaks the bank and wins over $24 million. The three Starfleet officers then announce themselves as the foreign investors and buy the hotel with their winnings, give the rest of the money away to the staff and other gamblers, and depart as stated in the novel. After they return to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Riker and Picard speculate on the alien contamination of Richey&#x27;s ship and how it could have ended up so far from Earth. Picard muses that the entire incident is a puzzle they may never be able to solve, similar to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

== Trivia ==
* The episode was written by Tracy Tormé under the pseudonym of Keith Mills. Tormé had his name removed from the credits after he became unsatisfied with rewrites. His original idea was a surreal nightmare about an astronaut stuck forever in his most pleasant memory.
* The episode mentions Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and that it still had not been solved after 800 years. A proof was, however, found by Andrew Wiles and published in 1995, six years after the episode aired. The resulting incongruity in &quot;The Royale&quot; was later addressed in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Facets&quot;.
* In the scene where Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge scans the planet, he describes the surface temperature as −291 °C (-17.85 K), a negative temperature: below absolute zero (−273.15 °C), but &quot;hotter&quot; than anything with a positive temperature.
* The aforementioned planet is estimated to be 72 billion earth years old, far older than the universe itself (13.8 billion years) and, despite the expansion of the universe, belies how it is still located within the particle horizon (46.9 billion years).
* In the scene where Lt. Commander Data observes a couple playing blackjack, he advises a woman that &quot;the odds favor standing pat&quot; on her total of hard thirteen against a dealer&#x27;s king up; but the optimal play is to take a card.

== Reception ==
Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club rated it B and wrote that the episode is &quot;watchable&quot; but does not live up to his memories. 
Keith R. A. DeCandido of Tor.com rated the episode 5 out of 10.

In 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;The Royale&quot; one of the ten funniest episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

<text>William Byron, 5th Baron Byron (5 November 1722 – 19 May 1798), was a British nobleman, peer, politician, and great-uncle of the poet George Gordon Byron who succeeded him in the title. As a result of a number of stories that arose after a duel, and then because of his financial difficulties, he became known after his death as &quot;the Wicked Lord&quot; and &quot;the Devil Byron&quot;.

==Early life==
Byron was the son of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron, and his wife the Hon. Frances Berkeley, a descendant of John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. He inherited his title upon the death of his father on 18 August 1736.

He clearly had some military aspirations, enlisting in the Royal Navy as a midshipman aged 14 and serving aboard HMS &quot;Victory&quot; as a lieutenant at 18. At 17 he was also listed as a founding Governor of the Foundling Hospital, a popular charity project to look after abandoned babies that had previously been championed by his mother. After an abortive stint as a captain in the Duke of Kingston&#x27;s Regiment during the Jacobite Rebellion, he went on to marry Elizabeth Shaw, daughter and heiress of Charles Shaw of Besthorpe in Norfolk, on 28 March 1747. They went on to have four children – two of whom lived to adulthood – including:

* Hon. William Byron (b. 7 June 1748March/May 1749).
* Hon. William Byron, MP (27 October 1749 – 22 June 1776).
*Hon. Henrietta Diana Byron (June/August 1751May/June 1760).
*Hon. Caroline Byron (b. 17 January 1755).

The month after his marriage he was elected Grand Master of the Premier Grand Lodge of England, a position he held until 20 March 1752. He also served as Master of the Staghounds from 1763 until 1765, though he achieved nothing of note in either role.

Byron was initiated to the Scottish Rite Masonry and became Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England (Moderns) from 1747 to 1751.

==Duel with William Chaworth==
On 26 January 1765, Byron killed his distant cousin and neighbour, William Chaworth, in a dispute at the &#x27;Star and Garter&#x27; tavern (on the site of the Carlton Club), Pall Mall, in London. The fight resulted from an argument the two had been engaged in over cups of wine, with both insisting they had more game on their estates. Lord Byron and his cousin retired to a dim room to resolve their disagreement and it was there that Lord Byron thrust his sword through Chaworth&#x27;s stomach. Chaworth lived until the following day, expressing his disgust that he had not been of sound enough mind to insist they fight in a location outfitted with better lighting before finally succumbing to his injury. Lord Byron was tried for Chaworth&#x27;s death, but was found guilty only of manslaughter. He claimed the benefit of the statute of Edward VI and so instead of being &quot;burned in the hand&quot; was forced to pay a small fine.

==Gossip and myths==
Lord Byron already had a poor reputation at the time of Chaworth&#x27;s death – but as he awaited his trial at the Tower of London, Horace Walpole described how countless malicious stories about him were &#x27;revived or invented&#x27;. Some contained a kernel of truth, but others were entirely fabricated. They included the accusations that he had murdered a coachman and paid off his family, and that he had murdered his own wife.

Many more myths about him were first set in print in the 19th century, decades after his death. These first appear in the 1820s and 1830s, some of which appear to have been invented by the American writer Washington Irving, including:
*That he became a recluse at Newstead Abbey after the duel of 1765;
*That he intentionally laid waste to his estates and the Byron family fortune in revenge for his son&#x27;s disobedience;
*That he mounted the sword he used to kill Chaworth on the wall in his bedroom at Newstead Abbey;
*That he spent his youth organising orgies at Newstead Abbey; and spent his later years worshipping Satan;
*That in his eccentric, perhaps insane, old age, he cultivated a swarm of crickets, which he trained to race all over his body and which abandoned his home at the moment of his death.

The stories have been propagated particularly by biographers of Byron&#x27;s great-nephew, the poet.

==After the duel==
Far from becoming a recluse, immediately after the duel, Byron planned a holiday to the Belgian town of Spa with his wife and sister, Isabella, Lady Carlisle. The latter noted that the couple were unable to control their spending, calling them &quot;ye worst managers I ever saw&quot;.

Sometime in the late 1760s, Byron schemed to resolve his serious financial difficulties by marrying his son and heir William into a wealthy family. But just before the marriage William eloped with his cousin Juliana Byron, the daughter of Byron&#x27;s younger brother, the naval captain and later Vice-Admiral John Byron.

Despite the myth that Lord Byron became enraged by his son&#x27;s elopement and subsequently tried to wreak revenge by ruining his inheritance – tearing down trees, selling off artworks and killing over 2000 deer – the fall of the estate in fact came about because Lord Byron simply could not pay his debts without the cash injection through an affluent daughter-in-law.

The real neglect of Newstead did not occur until after the death of Byron&#x27;s son in 1776 – this left Byron legally unable to sell off parts of his lands and estate without the permission of an adult heir (his grandson was not due to turn 21 until 1793).

In around 1778, he was forced to sell off the majority of his effects at Newstead Abbey, in what became known as the &quot;Great Sale&quot; – this included artistic masterpieces, hunting gear, furniture and even toothpicks. His wife Elizabeth left him shortly afterwards, taking their only surviving child Caroline with her. Caroline died in 1784, leaving the couple childless.

Later accounts attest that he subsequently took one of the servants, Elizabeth Hardstaff, as his mistress and that she became known as &quot;Lady Betty&quot;. Though there is no solid evidence of a relationship, she was one of the few people mentioned in his will.

==Death and legacy==
Byron also outlived his grandson, a young man who, at the age of twenty-two, was killed by cannon fire in 1794 while fighting in Corsica. Expectation of the barony then fell to his great-nephew, George Gordon Byron, who became the 6th Baron Byron when Lord Byron died on 21 May 1798, at the age of seventy-five. The 5th Baron Byron is buried in the Byron vault at the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Hucknall, Hucknall Torkard in Nottinghamshire.

<doc id="561800" wikidata="Q4065233" url="?curid=561800" title="Andagoya">
<text>Andagoya is a village in west-central Colombia. Andagoya is named for Pascual de Andagoya (1495–1548), a Spanish conquistador.

==History==
A cacique named Pocorosa lived in Andagoya in the 19th century. Pocorosa met the Spanish conquistadors.

==Climate==
Andagoya has one of the most monotonous climates in the world. Its annual range of mean monthly temperatures – that is to say, the difference between the warmest and coldest months – at Andagoya is mere 0.8C (1.5F) as March, the warmest month, has an average temperature of while November, the &quot;coldest&quot; month, averages ; the average annual temperature is . This near complete uniformity of temperature is caused by the fact that Andagoya, at a latitude of 5°5&#x27; North, lies extremely close to the thermal equator, which is situated a few degrees north of the astronomical equator because the Earth reaches perihelion (its closest position to the Sun in its orbit) in early January and is at aphelion (furthest away) in early July, causing places located precisely at the equator to receive somewhat more insolation (i.e., light and heat energy from the sun) in January than in July even though the height of the sun and the length of days would be the same at both times. At a few degrees north latitude, however, the perihelion/aphelion factor and the slightly higher sun and longer days experienced at the time of the summer solstice for the Northern Hemisphere cancel each other out, making the level of insolation experienced there virtually identical throughout the year.

Every month of the year has at least of average precipitation, with the wettest month (May) averaging . Average annual precipitation is , and more rain falls at night than during the day, the reverse of what is true in most places that have tropical rainforest climate.

<doc id="561805" wikidata="Q3237299" url="?curid=561805" title="Lewis MacKenzie">
<text>Lewis Wharton MacKenzie CM, MSC, OOnt, CD (born 30 April 1940) is a Canadian retired major general, author and media commentator. MacKenzie is known for establishing and commanding Sector Sarajevo as part of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia in 1992. MacKenzie was criticized for his role in the Somalia Affair and for Canada&#x27;s peacekeeping failures in Bosnia. He was later a vocal opponent of NATO&#x27;s involvement in the Kosovo War.

==Biography==
MacKenzie was born in Truro, Nova Scotia, the son of Eugene and Shirley MacKenzie (&quot;nee&quot; Wharton.) He was raised in nearby Princeport. He is named after his great uncle, Liverpool, Nova Scotia schooner captain Lewis Wharton. MacKenzie&#x27;s forefather Israel Wharton fought as a United Empire Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War, taking part in the Battle of Waxhaws, before he subsequently settled in the Liverpool area.

==Military career==
MacKenzie enlisted with The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada and was commissioned in 1960. During his Canadian army career, MacKenzie served nine years in West Germany with NATO forces and had nine peacekeeping tours of duty with the United Nations in six different mission areas – the Gaza Strip (1963 and 1964), Cyprus (1965,1971 and 1978), Vietnam, Egypt, Central America (1990–91, commanding the United Nations Observer Mission) and the former Yugoslavia (1992–1993).

Between peacekeeping missions MacKenzie served as an instructor at the Canadian Forces Command and Staff College (1979–82) and as director of army training at St. Hubert, Que. (1983–85). As commander of the Canadian Forces Base in Gagetown, N.B. (1988–90) he was responsible for training officers at the Combat Training Centre. In 1985, he was appointed director of Combat-Related Employment for Women and, in 1991, he was appointed deputy commander of the Canadian Army&#x27;s Land Force Central Area.

Following his return from the Balkans in October 1992, MacKenzie was appointed commander of the army in Ontario. He retired from the Canadian Forces in 1993, after a 33-year career.

He was the first Canadian, military or civilian, to be awarded a second Meritorious Service Cross. The second was Brigadier-General Guy Laroche in October 2010.

==Somalia Affair==
Lewis MacKenzie was criticised by the Somalia Commission of Inquiry for his contribution to the Somalia Affair after Canadian Forces in Somalia committed human rights abuses and breaches of international humanitarian law and members of the Canadian command were found to have engaged in a subsequent cover-up.
The Commission observed that MacKenzie testified in an honest and straightforward manner; it did not always accept everything that he said but accepted that he offered the truth as he saw it. It found that his superiors&#x27; desire to parade his successes as a bona fide hero of the Canadian Forces had impaired his ability to supervise and control matters that were his core responsibilities.

The Commission found that MacKenzie had failed adequately to investigate the significant leadership and discipline problems in the Canadian Airborne Regiment, to inform himself of the problems and to take decisive remedial steps to ensure they were adequately resolved. In addition, it found that he did not adequately monitor the Regiment&#x27;s training to ensure its development as a cohesive unit or make adequate provisions for the troops to be trained or tested on its newly developed Rules of Engagement and failed to direct and supervise the training of the Canadian Joint Force Somalia personnel in the Law of Armed Conflict for peace support operations.

The Commission further ruled that MacKenzie had important obligations as a commander and so bore responsibility for the failures that attached to the discharge of those obligations. His role was pivotal and despite the fact that he was necessarily absent from his post due to obligations condoned by his superiors, errors in the chain of command below him remained his responsibility and flowed upwards from him to the highest levels of the command structure.

==Bosnian War==
In February 1992, MacKenzie was named chief of staff of the United Nations peacekeeping force in former Yugoslavia, tasked with supervising the cease-fire in Croatia. The force headquarters were located in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In April 1992, the Bosnian war broke out. MacKenzie created and assumed command of the peacekeeping force&#x27;s Sector Sarajevo in May 1992. He used his UN force to open Sarajevo Airport for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Using the media as a means of trying to help restore peace, MacKenzie became an international celebrity.

MacKenzie returned from the Balkans in October 1992 in controversial circumstances. As a member of the Canadian armed forces he was precluded from commenting on government policy. After criticising the United Nations&#x27; inability to command, control, and support its peacekeeping forces, he retired from the military in March 1993.

He has since written and lectured on his experiences in the former Yugoslavia questioning the numbers killed in the Srebrenica massacre, an event that came after his period of service in the area. He has challenged the findings of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and, in 2005, contested the conclusions and reasoning of the Appeal Chamber&#x27;s 2004 judgment in the Krstić case that the crime of genocide was perpetrated at Srebrenica in July 1995.
He has also disputed that Srebrenica ever was a UN Safe area, and argued that the demilitarization requirements imposed on both the Serb side (surrounding Srebrenica) and the Bosniak side (inside the enclave) were never fulfilled.

Srđa Pavlović of the University of Alberta, a Serbian-Montenegrin historian specializing in the political and cultural history of the South Slavs during the 19th and 20th centuries, wrote that &quot;(s)ince mid-1990s the denying of the Srebrenica genocide has been a main feature of all of General MacKenzie&#x27;s public addresses on the breakup of Yugoslavia&quot;, adding that the &quot;majority of scholars specializing in the Balkan history and the breakup of Yugoslavia view Major General MacKenzie as a promoter of a narrative that denies Serbia&#x27;s responsibility in that bloody breakup and as someone who disputes the evidence of genocide committed in Srebrenica that was presented to the ICTY in The Hague&quot;
The 2000 book &quot;The Lion, the Fox, and the Eagle&quot; by Carol Off, which devotes a third of its content to MacKenzie&#x27;s role in Yugoslavia, claims that MacKenzie was willfully ignorant of the Bosnian political situation and was manipulated into being a vehicle of pro-Serb propaganda. In 1993, investigative reporter and Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Roy Gutman accused Mackenzie of having two trips to Washington D.C., one to speak in front of the Heritage Foundation and the other to appear as an expert witness for the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, funded by SERBNET, a Serbian-American lobbyist group. In a telephone interview with Gutman, MacKenzie responded, &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there was some Serbian involvement considering who initiated the contract; however I would be very disappointed if that were the case.&quot; The day after the interview, an article appeared in &quot;Newsday&quot; suggesting that MacKenzie was on the Serbian payroll. When MacKenzie confirmed the source of the funds was indeed SERBNET, he donated the entire fee to the Canadian Federation of Aids Research (CANFAR). However, UN officials ultimately criticised his &quot;lack of judgment&quot; in the matter.

==Post-Military==
===Media===
MacKenzie is the author of two books:
* &quot;Peacekeeper: Road to Sarajevo&quot;
* &quot;Soldiers Made Me Look Good: A Life in the Shadow of War&quot;
and also writes short essays about military affairs, most often in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;:
* &quot;We can help in Mali without putting ‘boots on the ground’&quot; 23 Jan 2013
* &quot;The road to Damascus goes through Moscow&quot; 22 Feb 2012
* &quot;NATO&#x27;s Libya &#x27;hope&#x27; strategy is bombing&quot; 10 Jun 2011
He is frequently sought by Canadian broadcast media as a security and military affairs commentator:
* &quot;Cracks showing in NATO&#x27;s Libya strategy&quot; 22 Jun 2011
* &quot;As politicians hit hustings, Canada&#x27;s Libya mission flies under the radar&quot; 24 Mar 2011
* &quot;Tories let election skirmishes eclipse war in Libya&quot; 29 Mar 2011
* &quot;Daniel Ménard scandal leaves military reeling&quot; 30 May 2010

In 2005, following the appointment of former Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire as a Liberal senator, MacKenzie wrote an editorial in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; entitled &quot;Roméo, Roméo, wherefore art thou partisan?&quot; arguing that Dallaire had compromised his previous stance by endorsing the Liberal Party&#x27;s position on intervention in Sudan.

On 19 April 2010, MacKenzie was interviewed on CTV&#x27;s &quot;Power Play&quot; in relation to accusations by Ahmadshah Malgarai, a translator, who witnessed interrogations in which a witness allegedly recounted that the Canadian military murdered a 17-year-old Afghan. MacKenzie dismissed those accusations as &quot;crap&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; to the Canadian military, while he viewed the denial by the Canadian military as credible. Amir Attaran, a law professor and lawyer for Malgarai disagreed with Mackenzie, arguing that instead of comparing credibility, the military must release the records of detainee interrogations to Parliament, so that Parliament may determine what occurred, based upon the available facts. According to Attaran, it is a legal requirement that the documents regarding detainee interrogations be produced, while they need not be made public. MacKenzie called it &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;ludicrous&quot; to table such documents in Parliament and that, furthermore, he was &quot;not concerned&quot; about the legal requirement to do so. Near the end of the interview, MacKenzie verbally attacked Dr. Attaran: &quot;Last time I checked, in various polls being done across Canada, the Canadian Forces are at the very top of trustworthiness with the Canadian population. I won&#x27;t mention where lawyers were slated.&quot;

MacKenzie is interviewed in two documentary films by Serbian-Canadian film-maker Boris Malagurski: &quot;&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Weight of Chains&quot; (2011). He also contributed to the Canadian documentary &quot;If I Should Fall&quot;, which focuses on the Canadian military experience in Afghanistan since 9/11.

In 2021, Mackenzie was announced as the Honorary Commander of the Fort Henry Guard, based out of Fort Henry National Historic Site in Kingston, Ontario.

===Politics===
In the 1997 federal election, MacKenzie was Progressive Conservative candidate for Parliament for the central Ontario riding of Parry Sound-Muskoka. Visiting the riding, Tory leader Jean Charest rhetorically asked a crowd of supporters whether MacKenzie or Sheila Copps would be a better Deputy Prime Minister, but later explained that this was an example rather than his party&#x27;s selection. The Tories improved their standing and regained official party status, though MacKenzie finished second to Liberal incumbent Andy Mitchell.

Around 2011, MacKenzie unsuccessfully advocated for a plan to revive and modernize the Avro Canada Arrow interceptor aircraft as an alternative to the Lockheed Martin Lightning II multirole fighter then being considered for Canadian service. MacKenzie said he was not working for Bourdeau Industries, the private proposer of the plan, but governmental accountability advocate Duff Conacher, interviewed by the CBC, questioned MacKenzie&#x27;s activity as a possible conflict of interest and expressed concern that it was possible for him to deliver a company&#x27;s proposal to the government without being a registered lobbyist.

====Electoral record====
===Leisure activities===

MacKenzie is a lifelong automobile racing enthusiast. According to an article in the 23 September 2007 &quot;Victoria Times Colonist&quot;, he is an enthusiastic, skilled, and competitive race car driver having won the 2007 Diamond Class Ontario championship for Formula Fords at the age of 67.

==Honours==
In 1993 he was that year&#x27;s recipient of the Vimy Award, from the &quot;Conference of Defence Associations Institute&quot;.

In 2006, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="561808" wikidata="Q5183282" url="?curid=561808" title="Crazy for Daisy">
<text>Crazy for Daisy was a British comic strip by Nick Brennan published in the magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. It debuted on 14 June 1997 in issue 2865 as a part of a selection of six comic strips to be voted by readers. The strip won (alongside with &quot;Tim Traveller&quot;), beating &quot;Camp Cosmos, Have a Go Jo, Sydd&quot; and &quot;Trash Can Ally&quot;. 

==Concept==

The strip starred Ernest Valentine, a stupid boy who is hopelessly in love with Daisy. Daisy, however, has no feelings at all for Ernest, but Ernest always fails to get the message. He follows her around and even pops out of cakes to see her. Usually, by the end of the strip, Daisy ends up going out with another man who is in some way connected with the strip, e.g. a fireman that gets called out. Daisy has only one set of clothes, and, not counting the earliest strips, never wears anything else. In one strip she opens her wardrobe and she has many sets of identical clothes and then shops for more.

By the time the 2000s came, the strip was still going strong, but with a slight twist to the usual ending of the strip; rather than Ernest being jilted by Daisy for another man, Ernest usually ended up being beaten up, falling from a great height, or otherwise suffering some painful misfortune, which usually put him in traction. While probably not totally intentional, this was part of the Beano&#x27;s recent move towards using more slapstick.

For a while Joe King&#x27;s Joke Corner was at the bottom of this strip, but was moved later on.

Once it was dropped from the weekly Beano, the Fun-Size Beano still reprinted some stories from previous Fun-Sizes. It was the most recent strip ever featured in Classics from the Comics, with a 2003 story appearing in the August 2008 issue, Number 148.</text><links>

<doc id="561809" wikidata="Q7450728" url="?curid=561809" title="Senior airman">
<text>Senior airman is an enlisted rank found in the Liberian Air wing and the United States Air Force. 

==United States==
Senior airman (SrA) is the fourth enlisted rank in the United States Air Force, just above airman first class and below staff sergeant. The rank designation is the same for male and female. It has a pay grade of E-4. Between its approval on 30 December 1975 (with implementation 1 June 1976) and 19 March 1991, senior airmen wore sleeve chevrons with blue center stars instead of silver to distinguish them from the non-commissioned officer rank of &quot;sergeant&quot;, also a pay grade of E-4. The latter was abolished in 1991 and the blue center star was changed to white to conform to all enlisted rank chevrons.

The Air Force promotes an airman first class (A1C) to senior airman after 36 months &quot;time in service&quot; (TIS) and 20 months &quot;time in grade&quot; (TIG), or 28 months TIG, whichever occurs first. Outstanding airmen first class, limited to no more than 15 percent of the total, may be promoted to senior airmen six months early, in a competitive process called below the zone. Senior airmen are expected to be technically proficient and begin to develop leadership skills, and may be expected to supervise an airman of lesser rank.
Senior airmen must attend the six-week Airman Leadership School, the first course of the Air Force&#x27;s college of enlisted professional military education, before being promoted to staff sergeant. SrAs with no projected promotion and between three and six years TIS, may attend Airman Leadership School.

===History===

Formerly, from 1976 to 1991, this grade was divided into ranks with separate titles: sergeant (referred to unofficially but almost universally within the USAF as &quot;buck sergeant&quot; or simply &quot;buck&quot;), a non-commissioned officer; and senior airman, which is the equivalent of specialist, a non-supervisory rank. Senior airmen were promoted to sergeant after 12 months&#x27; TIG and completion of the now-defunct Non-commissioned Officer Preparatory Course. This schism reflected a desire by the Air Force in 1976 to subdivide enlisted ranks into a three-tier organization, a move which was resisted by the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, resulting in the compromise dual-rank that lasted fifteen years. The last Air Force promotions to sergeant were effective 1 April 1991. Those personnel who had been promoted to sergeant prior to this cut off date retained the rank until being promoted to a higher rank or leaving the service. There are no longer any personnel on active duty who hold this rank. Due to high year of tenure rules in effect at the time, the last person to hold the rank was forced out of the Air Force on 23 March 1998. Sergeants wore the same chevrons as present-day senior airmen. Senior airmen wore similar chevrons, but with a blue (green on the fatigue or battle dress uniform) subdued central star, as did all airmen in the lowest tier.

The ranks of senior airman and sergeant held the same pay grade, but sergeants were expected to supervise other airmen as part of their duties as non-commissioned officers. As with any change in policy, many airmen supported this change, while others protested. Those Air Force members against the change protested that the rank of sergeant prepared airmen for transition to staff sergeant, and that new staff sergeants would therefore be less well-trained for their new position. In addition, senior airmen who complete Airman Leadership School may be expected to supervise lower-ranking airmen but are not considered non-commissioned officers and therefore have limited authority. Air Force personnel who supported the change argued that proper leadership training eliminated the need for a separate rank within the pay grade; moreover, the rank created disparity between individuals earning the same pay and benefits and, often, performing the same duties, since often there were no additional junior airmen in a given duty section for a new buck sergeant to supervise. 

Senior airmen are the lowest USAF rank eligible for selection as USAF recruiters, and (before the fall of 2013) as military training instructors for USAF basic military training.

, the USAF and the US Space Force are the only United States military services that do not have a non-commissioned officer rank at the E-4 pay grade. Previously, from 1947 to 1952, and from late 1968 or early 1969 to 1997, the rank of sergeant (E-4) was a non-commissioned officer rank in the USAF. In the interim, from 1952 to at least early 1968, the paygrade rank was titled &quot;airman first class&quot;.

<doc id="561818" wikidata="Q7692294" url="?curid=561818" title="Technical sergeant">
<text>Technical sergeant is the name of three current and two former enlisted ranks in the United States Armed Forces, as well as in the U.S. Civil Air Patrol. Outside the United States, it is used only by the Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force, and the Philippine Marine Corps.

==Philippines==
The rank of technical sergeant is used by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It is a enlisted personnel rank used by Philippine Army, Philippine Air Force and Philippine Marine Corps (under the Philippine Navy). The rank stands above the rank of staff sergeant and below master sergeant. 

==United States==
Technical sergeant is a rank in the United States Air Force, United States Space Force, and Civil Air Patrol. It is a former rank in the United States Army and United States Marine Corps.

===Army===
The rank of technical sergeant existed from after World War I until 1948 when the rank was renamed sergeant first class. In 1920 the army combined several battalion/squadron level &quot;staff&quot; NCO ranks, including battalion quartermaster sergeant, battalion supply sergeant, ordnance sergeant, hospital sergeant, three grades of master sergeant (junior grade), and six additional senior-level technical and specialist ranks into the new technical sergeant rank. In 1944 when rifle squad leaders became staff sergeants, platoon sergeants were promoted to technical sergeants. In 1948 the army renamed technical sergeant as sergeant first class.
===Marine Corps===
Technical sergeant was a rank in the United States Marine Corps until 1958. From 1941 until 1946, the rank was equivalent to grade 2, ranking with gunnery sergeant and other technical ranks. From 1947 until 1958, the rank was reclassified as E-6 and became the sole rank in this grade. The rank gunnery sergeant replaced it and elevated to E-7 after the reorganization of grades in 1959.
===Air Force===
Technical sergeant, &quot;tech sgt&quot; or &quot;TSgt&quot; in informal parlance, is the sixth enlisted rank (pay grade E-6) in the U.S. Air Force, just above staff sergeant and below master sergeant. A technical sergeant is a noncommissioned officer and abbreviated as TSgt (with no period in official USAF and other military correspondence). Official terms of address are &quot;technical sergeant&quot; or &quot;sergeant&quot;, although many use &quot;tech sergeant&quot; in informal situations.

====Civil Air Patrol====
The Civil Air Patrol (CAP), a non-profit corporation Congressionally chartered to operate as the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, has a quasi-military structure which includes the rank of technical sergeant. The grade of technical sergeant is above staff sergeant and beneath master sergeant. Former military enlisted personnel who held the rank of technical sergeant in the United States Armed Forces may retain that rank as members of the CAP.

Cadets in the Civil Air Patrol can hold the grade of cadet technical sergeant (abbreviated C/TSgt). The grade of cadet technical sergeant is above cadet staff sergeant and beneath cadet master sergeant. Cadet technical sergeants typically serve as flight sergeants
===Space Force===
On February 1, 2021, the United States Space Force announced its permanent rank structure, establishing the grade of technical sergeant as its permanent E-6 grade. This continued its usage from the Air Force. The grade of technical sergeant is above sergeant and beneath master sergeant.

Al Maktoum was the first vice president to serve as prime minister concurrently, when he became prime minister on 30 April 1979. After him the office of prime minister was &quot;de facto&quot; tied to the office of vice president (but not vice versa).

==Development of Dubai==
Sheikh Rashid was responsible for the transformation of Dubai from a small cluster of settlements near the Dubai Creek to a modern port city and commercial hub. 

A quote commonly attributed to Sheikh Rashid reflected his concern that Dubai&#x27;s oil, which was discovered in 1966 and which began production in 1969, would run out within a few generations.

&quot;My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel&quot;,

He therefore worked to develop the economy of Dubai so that it could survive after the end of oil production, and was a driving force behind a number of major infrastructure projects to promote Dubai as a regional hub for trade, such as:

#Port Rashid (opened in 1972)
#Al Shindagha Tunnel (opened in 1975)
#Jebel Ali Port (opened in 1979)
#Dubai World Trade Centre (built in 1978)
#The second major dredging and widening of the Dubai Creek (early 1970s)
#Dubai Drydocks (opened in 1983)

==Relationship with other emirates ==
There had been an armed border dispute between the Emirate of Dubai and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi in 1946, and when Sheikh Rashid became ruler of Dubai, there was still a state of stand-off between the two emirates. Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s accession did not serve to improve the situation because of a delicate family relationship. The ruling emir of Abu Dhabi, Shakhbut, was a first cousin of Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s only wife, Latifah. Their fathers had been brothers. However, Shakhbut&#x27;s father had killed Latifah&#x27;s father and seized the throne of Abu Dhabi in 1922, causing Latifah&#x27;s family to flee to Dubai where, many years later, the two families arranged for Sheikh Rashid to marry Latifah. Given this history, there was little love lost between the cousins and relations between the two emirates did not improve until much later. 

Instead, Sheikh Rashid established a close relationship with Qatar, who was a rival of Abu Dhabi on the other (western) border. Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s daughter married the new emir of Qatar in 1961 and a warm relationship was established. Thus, when India devalued the Gulf Rupee in 1966, both Qatar and Dubai adopted the Qatar-Dubai Riyal as a common currency, whereas Abu Dhabi adopted the Bahraini dinar. 

Sheikh Rashid also established close relations with Kuwait and other royal families in the region. The Emir of Kuwait assisted in the financing of the dredging of Dubai creek. Dubai also raised funds for the dredging by issuing bonds, known as the &#x27;creek bonds,&#x27; which proved popular with investors. Revenue derived from land reclamation made possible by the dredging proved crucial for funding Dubai&#x27;s future growth. The dredging and land reclamation project, regarded at first as a folly, resulted in Dubai&#x27;s rising prominence as an entrepôt, a position cemented by the visionary construction of a 15-berth deep-water port, Port Rashid, starting in 1969.

Despite the rather fraught relationship between the two emirates, Sheikh Rashid brought Dubai to join Abu Dhabi and other northern emirates to create the United Arab Emirates in 1971. In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency, the UAE dirham.

Jebel Ali port was established in 1979, and the customs free zone Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ) was built around the port in 1985. By the late 1990s, JAFZ developed into a commercial free zone.

==Family==
Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s father was Sheikh Saeed bin Maktoum Al Maktoum, while his mother was Sheikha Hessa bint Al Mur bin Hureiz Al Falasi.
Sheikh Rashid Al Maktoum married only once. His wife, Sheikha Latifa bint Hamdan Al Nahyan, is the daughter of Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who had ruled Abu Dhabi for 10 years (1912–22). After her father was murdered by family members, Sheikha Latifa (along with other family members) fled Abu Dhabi and was taken in at her mother&#x27;s home in Dubai. Many years later, Sheikha Latifa was married to Rashid in a match arranged by their families. Rashid and Latifa had nine children, being four sons and five daughters:

# Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum (1943–2006), who succeeded his father as ruler of Dubai (ruled 1990–2006)
# Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum (1945–2021)
# Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (born 1949), who succeeded his elder brother as ruler of Dubai (ruling 2006-)
# Ahmed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (born 1951)
# Maryam bint Rashid Al Maktoum married the first Qatari emir, Ahmad bin Ali Al Thani, who was deposed in 1972 by a cousin.
# Fatima bint Rashid Al Maktoum. 
# Hassa bint Rashid Al Maktoum married to Ahmad bin Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum. Their children are Latifa bint Ahmed Al Maktoum and Rashid.
# Maitha bint Rashid Al Maktoum.
# Shaikha bint Rashid Al Maktoum married the Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Mohammed Al Saud, known as Al Samer, a very famous poet. They have 3 sons: Rashid (born 1996), Saud, and Mohammed.

Both his predecessor and successor as Prime Minister of the UAE was his son, Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid was the prime minister of United Arab Emirates from 1971 to 1979, and acceded as ruler of Dubai on his father&#x27;s death on 7 October 1990, until his death on 4 January 2006. Following Maktoum&#x27;s death in 2006, another of Sheikh Rashid&#x27;s sons, Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, acceded to these positions and is the current vice president and prime minister of the UAE and the ruler of Dubai.

Sheikh Rashid was half-brother—46 years older—to Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, presently the Chairman of Emirates Airline.

<doc id="561826" wikidata="Q2915698" url="?curid=561826" title="Surry Hills">
<text>Surry Hills is an inner-east suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Surry Hills is immediately south-east of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Surry Hills is surrounded by the suburbs of Darlinghurst to the north, Chippendale and Haymarket to the west, Moore Park and Paddington to the east and Redfern to the south. It is often colloquially referred to as &quot;Surry&quot;.

It is bordered by Elizabeth Street and Chalmers Street to the west, Cleveland Street to the south, South Dowling Street to the east, and Oxford Street to the north. Crown Street is a main thoroughfare through the suburb with numerous restaurants, pubs and bars. Central is a locality in the north-west of the suburb around Central station. Prince Alfred Park is located nearby. Strawberry Hills is a locality around Cleveland and Elizabeth Streets and Brickfield Hill to the east of that.

A multicultural suburb, Surry Hills has had a long association with the Portuguese community of Sydney.

== History ==
The first land grants in Surry Hills were made in the 1790s. Major Joseph Foveaux received . His property was known as Surry Hills Farm, after the Surrey Hills in Surrey, England. Foveaux Street is named in his honour. Commissary John Palmer received . He called the property George Farm and in 1800 Palmer also bought Foveaux&#x27;s farm. In 1792, the boundaries of the Sydney Cove settlement were established between the head of Cockle Bay to the head of Woolloomooloo Bay. West of the boundary, which included present-day Surry Hills, was considered suitable for farming and was granted to military officers and free settlers.

After Palmer&#x27;s political failures, his reduced financial circumstances forced the first subdivision and sale of his estate in 1814. Isaac Nichols bought Allotment 20, comprising over . Due to the hilly terrain, much of the suburb was considered remote and &#x27;inhospitable&#x27;. In the early years of the nineteenth century the area around what is now Prince Alfred Park was undeveloped land known as the Government Paddocks or Cleveland Paddocks. A few villas were built in the suburb in the late 1820s. The suburb remained one of contrasts for much of the nineteenth century, with the homes of wealthy merchants mixed with that of the commercial and working classes.

In 1820, Governor Macquarie ordered the consecration of the Devonshire Street Cemetery. A brick wall was erected before any interments took place to enclose its . Within a four-year period the cemetery was expanded by the addition of to its south. A road was formed along the southern boundary of the cemetery in the first half of the 1830s and was called Devonshire Street. The Devonshire Street Cemetery, where many of the early settlers were buried, was later moved to build the Sydney railway terminus. Central railway station was opened on 4 August 1906. The area around Cleveland and Elizabeth streets was known as Strawberry Hills. Strawberry Hills post office was located at this intersection for many years.

In 1833, the Nichols estate was subdivided and sold. One purchase was by Thomas Broughton and subsequently acquired by George Hill who constructed Durham Hall on this and adjoining lots. Terrace houses and workers&#x27; cottages were built in Surry Hills from the 1850s. Light industry became established in the area, particularly in the rag trade (clothing industry). It became a working class suburb, predominately inhabited by Irish immigrants. The suburb developed a reputation for crime and vice. The Sydney underworld figure Kate Leigh (1881–1964), lived in Surry Hills for more than 80 years.

In 1896 Patineur Grotesque one of Australia&#x27;s first films and first comedy routine filmed was shot in Prince Alfred Park by Marius Sestier.

Surry Hills was favoured by newly arrived families after World War II when property values were low and accommodation was inexpensive. From the 1980s, the area was gentrified, with many of the area&#x27;s older houses and building restored and many new upper middle-class residents enjoying the benefits of inner-city living. The suburb is now a haven for the upper middle class and young rich.

=== Trams ===
The West Kensington via Surry Hills Line operated from 1881 down Crown Street as far as Cleveland Street as a steam tramway. It was extended to Phillip Street in 1909, Todman Avenue in 1912, and then to its final terminus down Todman Avenue in 1937. When the line was fully operational it branched from the tramlines in Oxford Street and proceeded down Crown Street to Cleveland Street in Surry Hills, then south along Baptist Street to Phillip Street, where it swung left into Crescent Street before running south along Dowling Street. It passed the Dowling Street Depot, then turned left into Todman Avenue, where it terminated at West Kensington. The line along Crown Street closed in 1957, the remainder stayed open until 1961 to allow access to Dowling Street Tram Depot. Transdev John Holland routes 301, 302 and 303 generally follow the route down Crown and Baptist Streets as far as Phillip Street.

== Urban character ==

Surry Hills has a mixture of residential, commercial and light industrial areas. It remains Sydney&#x27;s main centre for fashion wholesale activities, particularly on the western side. The area is also home to a large LGBTQIA+ community, where Sydney&#x27;s Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (Pride Parade) takes place each year.

Surry Hills Markets are held in Shannon Reserve at the corner of Crown and Collins Streets, on the first Saturday of every month, and the Surry Hills Festival is an annual community event, attracting tens of thousands of visitors, held in and around Ward Park, Shannon Reserve, Crown Street and Hill Street.
The Surry Hills Library and Community Centre sits opposite Shannon Reserve and houses the local branch of the city library and the Surry Hills Neighbourhood Centre.

Major thoroughfares are Crown Street, Cleveland Street, Bourke Street and Foveaux Street. Surry Hills is within easy walking distance of the Sydney CBD, and is included in a widening network of cycleways.

Major construction took place on the Surry Hills section of the CBD and South East Light Rail which opened in December 2019 and April 2020 respectively. Transport for NSW managed this project. It has been reported that there has been some disruption to local businesses because of the construction work taking place.

<doc id="561834" wikidata="Q7450691" url="?curid=561834" title="Senior master sergeant">
<text>Senior master sergeant is the military rank for a senior non-commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries.

==Philippines==
===Armed forces===
Senior master sergeant is the second-highest attainable rank for enlisted personnel of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Air Force and the Philippine Marine Corps (a component of the Philippine Navy). 

The rank stands above that of master sergeant and below that of chief master sergeant.

===Philippine National Police===
As of February 8, 2019, a new ranking classification for the Philippine National Police was adopted, eliminating confusion of old ranks. The Police Senior master sergeant is third highest non-commissioned officer rank on the service. It stands above the rank of Police Master sergeant and below the Police Chief master sergeant.

==United States==
Senior master sergeant (abbreviated SMSgt) is the second-highest enlisted rank (pay grade E-8) in the United States Air Force and United States Space Force, just above master sergeant and below chief master sergeant, and is a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO).

According to Air Force Instruction 36-2618, &quot;The Enlisted Force Structure&quot;:
SMSgts are key, experienced, operational leaders, skilled at merging their personnel&#x27;s talents, skills, and resources with other teams&#x27; functions to most effectively accomplish the mission. SMSgts continue to develop their leadership and management skills in preparation for expanded responsibilities and higher leadership positions. SMSgts normally operate at the operational level of leadership.

Promotion to senior master sergeant is the most difficult enlisted promotion to attain in the Air Force and Space Force. It is the second enlisted grade in which results of a central promotion board is the only factor in selection for promotion. Usually, less than ten percent of eligible master sergeants are selected for promotion to senior master sergeant in most years. Selectees typically have vast technical and leadership experience gained from a broad variety of assignments at both line and staff functions during their careers. Additionally, the successful candidate typically has completed an associate or bachelor&#x27;s degree in their Air Force and Space Force specialty as well as the Senior Non-commissioned Officer Correspondence Course, and has had his or her latest performance report endorsed by a senior rater, usually a colonel or brigadier general.

in preparation for promotion to the rank of chief master sergeant, senior master sergeants typically assume superintendent duties, overseeing enlisted members&#x27; efforts to accomplish a major segment of a unit&#x27;s mission. They are expected to serve as mentors for non-commissioned and junior commissioned officers.

Public Law 107-107, the &quot;National Defense Authorization Act&quot;, establishes senior enlisted strength levels for all branches of the United States Armed Forces. Currently, only 2.5 percent of the Air Force&#x27;s total active duty enlisted strength may hold this rank.

Senior master sergeants are sometimes referred to by the nickname of &quot;Senior.&quot; In the past, this was a casual nickname that was inappropriate in formal situations. However, on 12 July 2018, new Air Force regulations were issued that made &quot;Senior&quot; one of the official terms of address for senior master sergeants, in addition to the pre-existing &quot;Senior Master Sergeant&quot; and &quot;Sergeant&quot; addresses.

Senior master sergeants in the first sergeant special duty serve as first sergeants of larger units than those employing master sergeants as first sergeants. These first sergeants (pay grades E-7 to E-9) are referred to officially as &quot;First Sergeant&quot; (regardless of their pay grade), and unofficially as &quot;First Shirt&quot; or simply &quot;Shirt&quot;.

===Historical note===
Although the Air Force has been an independent service since 1947, the rank of senior master sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958. This act established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 but without title. It was not until late 1958 that the title of &quot;senior master sergeant&quot; (and the accompanying rank insignia) was decided upon after the enlisted force was polled. At that time, the senior master sergeant rank had only a single chevron above and six below, and a chief master sergeant two above and six below. In 1994 the Air Force changed its non-commissioned officer insignia so that a maximum of five stripes were placed on the bottom of the chevrons, adding one above to each of the top three grades, resulting in the present form.

===Civil Air Patrol===
The Civil Air Patrol (CAP), a non-profit corporation Congressionally chartered to operate as the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, has a quasi-military structure which includes the rank of senior master sergeant. The grade of senior master sergeant is below chief master sergeant and above master sergeant. Former military enlisted personnel who held the rank of senior master sergeant in the United States Armed Forces may retain that rank as members of the CAP.

<doc id="561837" wikidata="Q156752" url="?curid=561837" title="Sumy">
<text>Sumy (, ) is a city in northeastern Ukraine. It serves as the administrative center of Sumy Oblast. The city is situated on the banks of the Psel River with a population of making it the 23rd-largest in the country.

The city of Sumy was founded in the 1650s by Cossacks within the historical region of Sloboda Ukraine.

== History ==
Sumy was founded by the Cossack Herasym Kondratyev from Stavyshche, Bila Tserkva Regiment on the banks of the Psel River, a tributary of the Dnieper. Whether it was founded in 1652 or 1655 remains a subject of discussion. In 1656–58 at the site of the Sumyn early settlement, under the leadership of the Muscovite voivode K. Arsenyev, a city fort was built, consisting of a fort and a grad (town). 

In the 1670s, Sumy was expanded with the addition of a fortified &quot;posad&quot; (craftsman town), after which it became the biggest fortress in Sloboda Ukraine. From 1658 onwards, Sumy was the center of the Sumy Cossack Regiment (military unit and local administrative division). In the 1680s, unfortified suburbs began to develop around the city.

At the end of the 17th century, Sumy played a role as a collection point for Muscovite troops during the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689. During the Great Northern War, from December 1708 to January 1709, the city was the &quot;stavka&quot; (headquarters) of the Muscovite Chief of Commander headed by Tsar Peter the Great. Established under the leadership of Prince A. Shakhovskoy, the Commission on streamlining the Sloboda Cossack regiments was located in 1734–43 in Sumy. From its establishment and until the liquidation of Cossackdom in Sloboda Ukraine in 1765, the Cossack officer family of Kondratyevs exercised great influence over the city.

Following the liquidation of the Cossack community in 1765, the Sumy Cossack Regiment as an administrative division was turned into Sumy Province of the newly created Sloboda Ukraine Governorate and the city of Sumy became its center. In 1780 Sumy was turned into a centre of Sumy uyezd. In 1786-89 the city was reformed by removing its city fort vallums. 

After a period of stagnation (1765–1860s), Sumy began to transform into a big industrial and trade center with Paul&#x27;s Sugar-Refining Factory (est. 1869 by I.Kharytonenko) and the Sumy Engineering Workshops (est. 1896, producing equipment for sugar refineries). With the construction of a railroad Vorozhba – Merefa, the Sumy train station was built in the city in January 1877. Various families of philanthropist industrialists, the most famous of which were the Kharytonenkos, contributed greatly to the development of Sumy.

During the Revolution of 1905, Sumy was one of several areas which became famous throughout Russia for having established an independent peasant republic -the Sumy Republic was established by a peasant union.

During the German occupation of Ukraine during World War II (1941–1944), Sumy sustained heavy damage and was occupied from 10 October 1941 to 2 September 1943. In February 1942, some 1,000 Jews were murdered in Sumy in two large-scale operations. In May-June that year, the Germans and their Hungarian allies killed an additional several dozen Jews, along with thirty Roma. Some 250 Hungarian Jews were also murdered in Sumy during the occupation period. The Germans operated a Nazi prison and a forced labour battalion for Jews in the city. After the war, the destroyed parts of the city were rebuilt.

On 24 February 2022, the first day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sumy came under attack by Russian forces.

On 4 April 2022 Governor of Sumy Oblast Dmytro Zhyvytskyi stated that Russian troops no longer occupied any towns or villages in Sumy Oblast and had mostly withdrawn, while Ukrainian troops were working to push out the remaining units. On 8 April, Governor Zhyvytskyi stated that all Russian troops had left Sumy Oblast, while adding that the territory of the region was still unsafe due to rigged explosives and other ammunition left behind by Russian troops.

== Geography ==
Sumy is located in the northeastern part of Ukraine within the Central Russian Upland and in the historical region of Sloboda Ukraine. It is located on the banks of the Psel River.
=== Climate ===
Due to its relatively close location, the city&#x27;s weather is similar to Kharkiv. Sumy&#x27;s climate is a warm-summer humid continental (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) with cold and snowy winters, and hot summers. The seasonal average temperatures are not too cold in winter, not too hot in summer: in January, and in July. The average rainfall totals per year, with the most in June and July.

Trends show an increase in the fall in precipitation in the coming decades.
==Government==
Sumy is a city of oblast significance which makes a separate subdivision within the Sumy Oblast. Sumy is also an administrative center of Sumy Raion which surrounds the city.

The city used to be divided into two urban districts, Zarichnyi and Kovpakovskyi, and 13 &quot;microraions&quot;. Since 2006, the subdivision into urban districts is not in effect.

The city municipality also includes several adjacent villages including Verkhnie Pishchane, Zhyteiske, Zahirske, Kyryiakivshchyna, Pishchane, and Trokhymenkove.

== Demographics ==
* 1897 - 70.53% Ukrainians, 24.1% Russians, 2.6% Jewish, 2.67% others
* 1926 - 80.7% Ukrainians, 11.8% Russians, 5.5% Jewish, 2% others
* 1959 - 79% Ukrainians, 20% Russians, 1% others

The majority of residents are Christians (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholics and Protestant or Evangelical Christians). There is also a Jewish minority.

From the beginning of the twentieth century, Sumy was the center of Roman Catholicism in northeastern Ukraine. The Blessed Virgin Mary Annunciation Church was established in the city in 1901 and consecrated in 1911, but closed by governmental authorities two decades later; the churchhouse was thereafter used for non-religious purposes (e.g., it was used as a gym for Oleksandrivska Gymnasia) until its restoration as a Roman Catholic parish in May 1994, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. It was reconsecrated in the spring of 1998.

It is a neoclassical structure of the 18th century, extensively repaired and reconstructed in 1858 and in the 1880s when the 56-metre-high bell tower (180 ft) was added. The interior features frescoes by Vladimir Makovsky and Klavdiy Lebedev.
*The Resurrection Church (1702), the oldest structure in the town, has had restoration work.
*The cathedral of the monastery of St. Pantaleon was erected in 1911 to a design by Aleksey Shchusev and resembles medieval monuments of Novgorod and Pskov.

*The Cathedral of Holy Trinity was built in 1902–1914 on the same pattern as the Cathedral of St. Isaac in St. Petersburg. The author of the design was Sumy architect G. Sholts. The work on the decorative design was not completed because of the revolutionary events of 1917.

=== Museums ===
The Sumy Regional Art Museum was opened in 1920. It started with nationalized private collections of the town and district. Paintings of Taras Shevchenko, Vladimir Borovikovsky, I. Shyskin, Arkhip Kuindzhi and Tetyana Yablonska are on display, including a Dutch landscape by a painter of Jan van Goyen&#x27;s circle. Today the museum contains unique paintings and works of applied art. The building of the early 20th century originally belonged to the State Bank.

The Museum of Local Lore was opened in 1920. In the years of fascist occupation, the most important items of its collections were lost. Today it contains unique collections covering archeology and the natural history of the Sumy region. It is located in the building of the 19th century which originally was the seat of the district government. In 1905 it was given to the printing house and publishing house of the first Sumy newspapers. In different years the building was visited by A. Kuprin and V. Korolenko, the famous Russian writers.

The Chekhov Museum, located on Chekhov street is an architectural complex representing Lintvarev&#x27;s country estate of the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1888 and 1889 a great writer and dramatist Anton Chekhov was dreaming of settling in Luka forever but his dream did not come true. “Abbacia and the Adriatic Sea are wonderful, but Luka and Psiol are better” – he wrote in his letter from Italy to his friends in Sumy in 1894. This is also a place where Anton Chekhov&#x27;s brother, Nikolai Chekhov, died in 1889.

The Museum of Banking history in the Sumy oblast and the History of Ukrainian Money was founded in 2006 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Ukrainian Academy of Banking based on a unique collection of Ukrainian bonds – the paper money out of circulation, which were given to the academy by the National Bank of Ukraine. The exposition of the bonds is arranged in the thematic-chronological order - from the first appearance of money to the present day. In addition to the numerous historical documents, photographs, metal money (coins, souvenir bars), and commemorative medals of the National Bank of Ukraine, there is an exhibition presenting technical appliances used in the banking industry in the late 20th century.

<text>A chief master sergeant is the military rank for a senior non-commissioned officer in the armed forces of some countries.

== Philippines ==
===Philippine armed forces===
Since 2004, as part of the ongoing modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, chief master sergeant has been the highest attainable rank for enlisted personnel of the Philippine Army, the Philippine Air Force, and the Philippine Marine Corps (a component of the Philippine Navy).

Above the rank is that of first chief master sergeant, also created in 2004 and bestowed on the most veteran non-commissioned officer who has served in the aforementioned service branches.

The rank of chief master sergeant stands above that of senior master sergeant. The equivalent naval rating is that of master chief petty officer.

Insignia of CMS in the PMC is straight rockers for non-command NCOs and curved for command NCOs.

===Philippine National Police===
As of February 8, 2019, a new ranking classification for the Philippine National Police was adopted, eliminating confusion among previous ranks. The enabling law for the ranking is Republic Act 11200 which was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte, amending the section of the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990 that refers to the ranking classification of the Philippine National Police.

The rank stands above that of police senior master sergeant and below police executive master sergeant.

== United States ==
Chief master sergeant (abbreviated as CMSgt) is the ninth, and highest, enlisted rank in the United States Air Force and the United States Space Force, just above senior master sergeant, and is a senior non-commissioned officer rank. A chief master sergeant sometimes is referred to as a &quot;chief.&quot;

Attaining the rank of chief master sergeant is the pinnacle of an Air Force or Space Force enlisted person&#x27;s career. Some chief master sergeants manage the efforts of all enlisted personnel within their unit or major subsection while others run major staff functions at higher headquarters levels. All chief master sergeants are expected to serve as mentors for non-commissioned officers and junior enlisted members, and to serve as advisers to unit commanders and senior officers.

By federal law, no more than 1.25% of the Air Force enlisted force may hold the rank of chief master sergeant.

=== Special duty positions ===
==== First sergeant ====
The E-9 pay grade of first sergeant is a special duty rank held by a senior enlisted member of a military unit who reports directly to the unit commander or deputy commander of operations. This positional billet is held by a chief master sergeant and is denoted on the rank insignia by a lozenge (known colloquially as a &quot;diamond&quot;). Often referred to as the &quot;first shirt&quot;, or &quot;shirt&quot;, the first sergeant is responsible for the morale, welfare, and conduct of all the enlisted members in a squadron and is the chief adviser to the squadron commander concerning the enlisted force. While neither the Air Force or Space Force has a permanent first sergeant rank, those who hold these positional billets are senior to their non-diamond counterparts.

==== Group senior enlisted leaders ====
In the Air Force, group senior enlisted leaders (SEL), formerly known as a group superintendent, fall under special reporting identifier coding with a 9G100 Air Force specialty code. Group superintendents provide leadership, management, and guidance in organizing, equipping, training, and mobilizing groups to meet home station and expeditionary mission requirements. Group superintendents work closely with their group commanders and command chief master sergeants to prepare the enlisted force to best execute mission requirements. They manage and direct resource activities as well as interpret and enforce policies and applicable directives. They also establish control procedures to meet mission goals and standards. Additionally, they recommend or initiate actions to improve organizational effectiveness and efficiency as well as ensure that the management of personnel and resources are consistent with current practices and procedures in support of a wing&#x27;s mission. They resolve issues between subordinate squadrons, other groups, wing staff, and outside agencies, and they perform other duties as directed by their group commanders.

==== Squadron senior enlisted leader ====
The duty position of squadron senior enlisted leader is the senior enlisted advisor to a unit commander and provides the parent organization(s) with subject matter expertise on the unit&#x27;s capabilities.

==== Wing Weapons Manager ====
In the Air Force, the Wing Weapons Manager (WWM) is a wing&#x27;s focal point for all weapons loading and armament systems-related matters and serves as the functional manager for all assigned 2W1X1&#x27;s. The WWM&#x27;s primary efforts focus on compliance, continuity, and standardization. The WWM is a (Chief Enlisted Manager code 2W100) command master sergeant assigned directly to the MXG/CC. Weapons activities required to support the generation of peacetime training sorties generally do not reinforce primary combat skills. Therefore, the WWM plays a key role in ensuring that the unit is able to produce combat-loaded aircraft. The WWM is charged with providing technical and managerial advice to senior leaders in matters of weapons loading and armament systems. The WWM coordinates with the Aircraft Maintenance Squadrons, Weapons Sections, Armament Flight, Wing Safety, Wing Weapons and Tactics Officer, Munitions Squadron/Flight, and other unit agencies on weapons-related matters. The WWM is a certifying official and evaluator for weapons-loading task certifications and qualifications.

=== Senior enlisted advisors ===
==== Command Chief Master Sergeant ====
The position of command chief master sergeant (CCM) is unique, as it is considered a rank and billet. Formerly, the billets were called senior enlisted advisors and were held by a chief master sergeant. These billets were turned into the permanent rank of command chief master sergeants in November 1998. Command chief master sergeants serve as the senior enlisted advisors to commanders at key levels of command; these include wings, numbered air forces, field operating agencies, and major commands. In a joint command, when an Air Force Chief fills a United States Department of Defense-nominated Command senior enlisted advisor position (see note), that individual is also designated as a &quot;command chief.&quot; Command chiefs advise their unit commanders on all enlisted matters, including all issues affecting the command&#x27;s mission and operations, and the readiness, training, utilization, morale, technical, professional development, and quality of life of all enlisted members in the organization. Command chiefs hold a reporting identifier of 9E000. CCMs provide leadership to the enlisted force and are the functional managers for group superintendents and first sergeants in their organizations.

=== Historical notes ===
Although the Air Force had been an independent service since 1947, the rank of chief master sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958. This act established the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 in the United States armed forces, but without specifying titles for those pay grades. It was not until late 1958 that the title &quot;chief master sergeant&quot; and the accompanying rank insignia were adopted.

The original chief master sergeant rank insignia, used from 1958 to 1994, consisted of two chevrons on top, three stripes in the middle, and three rockers on the bottom.

Until his retirement in 2003, Chief Master Sergeant Norman Marous was the Air Force&#x27;s most senior chief master sergeant, having served in the Air Force since 1962. Marous left active duty in 1967 to spend 22 years in the United States Air Force Reserve and National Guard before returning to active duty as a chief master sergeant in 1989. He retired in 2003 with 41½ years of service. He is the only person authorized to wear two longevity ribbons, due to the space required for the number of multiple award devices authorized.

=== Civil Air Patrol ===

The Civil Air Patrol (CAP), a non-profit corporation Congressionally chartered to operate as the civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, has a quasi-military structure which includes the rank of chief master sergeant. It is the most senior CAP enlisted rank. Former military enlisted personnel who held the rank of chief master sergeant may retain that rank as members of the CAP.

<text>Imatinib, sold under the brand names Gleevec and Glivec (both marketed worldwide by Novartis) among others, is an oral targeted therapy medication used to treat cancer. Imatinib is a small molecule inhibitor targeting multiple tyrosine kinases such as CSF1R, ABL, c-KIT, FLT3, and PDGFR-β. Specifically, it is used for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) that are Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph+), certain types of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), systemic mastocytosis, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, and rash. Severe side effects may include fluid retention, gastrointestinal bleeding, bone marrow suppression, liver problems, and heart failure. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Imatinib works by stopping the Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase. This can slow growth or result in programmed cell death of certain types of cancer cells.
Imatinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. A generic version became available in the UK as of 2017.

==Medical uses==
Imatinib is used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and a number of other malignancies. In 2006 the FDA expanded approved use to include dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD), and aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM).

Imatinib is considered to be a very effective treatment for CML, and has been shown to improve outcomes for people with this type of leukemia. It can also be used to treat some types of ALL, but is not considered a standard of care for ALL. In many cases, Imatinib can induce a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) and many patients can have a long-term remission. It is also used to maintain remission in chronic phase CML patients.

While Imatinib is a very effective treatment for CML and some types of ALL, it is not a cure for leukemia. Instead, it is a &#x27;chronic therapy&#x27; that helps to control the disease and prevent it from progressing. Some patients may need to continue taking Imatinib for an extended period of time to maintain remission, and some patients may eventually require additional treatment options.

===Chronic myelogenous leukemia===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved imatinib as first-line treatment for Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, both in adults and children. The drug is approved in multiple contexts of Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, including after stem cell transplant, in blast crisis, and newly diagnosed.

Due in part to the development of imatinib and related drugs, the five-year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia increased from 31% in 1993, to 59% in 2009, to 70% in 2016. By 2023, the five year survival rate for people with chronic myeloid leukemia had risen to 90%. Starting from 2011, it became clear that CML patients who continue to respond to imatinib have the same or almost the same life expectancy as the general population.

===Gastrointestinal stromal tumors===
The FDA first granted approval for advanced GIST patients in 2002. On 1 February 2012, imatinib was approved for use after the surgical removal of KIT-positive tumors to help prevent recurrence. The drug is also approved in unresectable KIT-positive GISTs.

===Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)===
The FDA granted approval for the treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) patients in 2006. Specifically adult patients with unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Prior to approval DFSP was considered unresponsive to chemotherapy treatments.

===Other===
The FDA has approved imatinib for use in adults with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved for use in children with Ph+ ALL.

For treatment of progressive plexiform neurofibromas associated with neurofibromatosis type I, early research has shown potential for using the c-KIT tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib. There have been several phase 2 trials of imatinib for aggressive fibromatosis.

==Contraindications and cautions==
The only known contraindication to imatinib is hypersensitivity to imatinib. Cautions include:
* Hepatic impairment
* Risk of severe CHF or left ventricular dysfunction, especially in patients with comorbidities
* Pregnancy, risk of embryo-fetal toxicity
* Risk of fluid retention
* Risk of growth stunting in children or adolescents

==Side effects==
The most common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, leg aches/cramps, fluid retention, visual disturbances, itchy rash, lowered resistance to infection, bruising or bleeding, loss of appetite, weight gain, reduced number of blood cells (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), and edema.

=== Cardiotoxicity ===
In some individuals, imatinib use was reported to be associated with left ventricular dysfunction which sometimes progressed to congestive cardiac failure despite an absence of prior heart disease. Clinical trials of imatinib did not report cardiac adverse effects, but had reported a notably high incidence of peripheral oedema, with some cases classified as severe.

Patient biopsies as well as mice treated with large doses of imatinib exhibited cellular signs of cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxic effects appeared to mediated by inhibition of cytoplasmic ABL1 tyrosine kinase.

=== Childhood growth inhibition ===
Multiple human and animal studies suggest that if imatinib is used in prepubescent children, it may delay normal growth (more specifically bone elongation), although some may experience at least partial catch-up growth during puberty.

The reason for this side effect is unclear; interference with a growth hormone (GH)-related pathway may be involved (prepubertal growth is GH-dependent, whereas pubertal growth is synergystically promoted by both GH and sex hormones).

===Pigmentation changes===
Imatinib use may cause lightening/depigmentation or darkening/repigmentation of hair (as is the case with some other tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and/or skin as well as hyperpigmentation of the gingiva. The median onset of hair color change is 4 weeks after initiation of therapy (but may occur over a year after initiation), is dose-dependent, and is reversible upon treatment discontinuation or dose reduction.

C-kit receptors - one of the biological target of imatinib - are expressed by melanocytes.

==Overdose==
Medical experience with imatinib overdose is limited. Treatment is supportive. Imatinib is highly plasma protein-bound: dialysis is unlikely to be helpful removing imatinib.

==Interactions==
Its use is advised against in people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, ritonavir and nefazodone due to its reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates of any of these enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St John&#x27;s Wort reduce the drug&#x27;s activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.

As with other immunosuppressants, application of live vaccines is contraindicated because the microorganisms in the vaccine could multiply and infect the patient. Inactivated and toxoid vaccines do not hold this risk, but may not be effective under imatinib therapy.

Eating grapefruit and drinking grapefruit juice are strongly discouraged as it increases the concentration of imatinib in the blood.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===

Imatinib is a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative that functions as a specific inhibitor of a number of tyrosine kinase enzymes. It occupies the &quot;TK&quot; active site, leading to a decrease in activity.

There are a large number of &quot;TK&quot; enzymes in the body, including the insulin receptor. Imatinib is specific for the &quot;TK&quot; domain in &quot;abl&quot; (the Abelson proto-oncogene), c-kit and PDGF-R (platelet-derived growth factor receptor).

In chronic myelogenous leukemia, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of &quot;abl&quot; with &quot;bcr&quot; (&quot;breakpoint cluster region&quot;), termed &quot;bcr-abl&quot;. As this is now a tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease &quot;bcr-abl&quot; activity.

The active sites of tyrosine kinases each have a binding site for ATP. The enzymatic activity catalyzed by a tyrosine kinase is the transfer of the terminal phosphate from ATP to tyrosine residues on its substrates, a process known as protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site of &quot;bcr-abl&quot;, locking it in a closed or self-inhibited conformation, and therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein semi-competitively. This fact explains why many BCR-ABL mutations can cause resistance to imatinib by shifting its equilibrium toward the open or active conformation.

Imatinib is quite selective for &quot;bcr-abl&quot;, though it does also inhibit other targets mentioned above (c-kit and PDGF-R), as well as ABL2 (ARG) and DDR1 tyrosine kinases and NQO2 – an oxidoreductase. Imatinib also inhibits the &quot;abl&quot; protein of non-cancer cells, but these cells normally have additional redundant tyrosine kinases, which allows them to continue to function even if &quot;abl&quot; tyrosine kinase is inhibited. Some tumor cells, however, have a dependence on &quot;bcr-abl&quot;. Inhibition of the &quot;bcr-abl&quot; tyrosine kinase also stimulates its entry in to the nucleus, where it is unable to perform any of its normal anti-apoptopic functions, leading to tumor cell death.

====Other pathways affected====
The Bcr-Abl pathway has many downstream pathways including
* the Ras/MapK pathway, which leads to increased proliferation due to increased growth factor-independent cell growth. 
* It also affects the Src/Pax/Fak/Rac pathway. This affects the cytoskeleton, which leads to increased cell motility and decreased adhesion. 
* The PI/PI3K/AKT/BCL-2 pathway is also affected. BCL-2 is responsible for keeping the mitochondria stable; this suppresses cell death by apoptosis and increases survival. 
* The last pathway that Bcr-Abl affects is the JAK/STAT pathway, which is responsible for proliferation.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Imatinib is rapidly absorbed when given by mouth, and is highly bioavailable: 98% of an oral dose reaches the bloodstream. Metabolism of imatinib occurs in the liver and is mediated by several isozymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. The main metabolite, &quot;N&quot;-demethylated piperazine derivative, is also active. The major route of elimination is in the bile and feces; only a small portion of the drug is excreted in the urine. Most of imatinib is eliminated as metabolites; only 25% is eliminated unchanged. The half-lives of imatinib and its main metabolite are 18 h and 40 h, respectively. It blocks the activity of Abelson cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (ABL), c-Kit and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). As an inhibitor of PDGFR, imatinib mesylate appears to have utility in the treatment of a variety of dermatological diseases. Imatinib has been reported to be an effective treatment for FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha+ mast cell disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.

==Chemistry==
===Synthesis===
==History==
Imatinib was invented in the late 1990s by scientists at Ciba-Geigy (which merged with Sandoz in 1996 to become Novartis), in a team led by the British biochemist Nicholas Lydon and that included Elisabeth Buchdunger and Jürg Zimmermann, and its use to treat CML was driven by oncologist Brian Druker of Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU). Other major contributions to imatinib development were made by biologist Anthony R. Hunter at Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, a physician, scientist, and hematologist at the University of Milano Bicocca, Italy, John Goldman at Hammersmith Hospital in London, and later on by Charles Sawyers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

Imatinib was developed by rational drug design. After the Philadelphia chromosome mutation and hyperactive &quot;bcr-abl&quot; protein were discovered, the investigators screened chemical libraries to find a drug that would inhibit that protein. With high-throughput screening, they identified 2-phenylaminopyrimidine. This lead compound was then tested and modified by the introduction of methyl and benzamide groups to give it enhanced binding properties, resulting in imatinib.

When Novartis tested imatinib in rats, mice, rabbits, dogs, and monkeys in 1996, it was found to have several toxic effects; in particular, results indicating liver damage in dogs nearly stopped drug development completely. However, favorable results in studies with monkeys and &quot;in vitro&quot; human cells allowed testing to continue in humans.

The first clinical trial of Gleevec took place in 1998, after Novartis reluctantly synthesized and released a few grams of the drug for Druker, enough for him to run a trial using a hundred or so patients. Mel Mann, who entered the clinical trial in August 1998, is the longest living person to be treated with the drug. The drug received FDA approval in May 2001, only two and a half years after the new drug application was submitted. On the same month it made the cover of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine as a &quot;bullet&quot; to be used against cancer. Druker, Lydon and Sawyers received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2009 for &quot;converting a fatal cancer into a manageable chronic condition&quot;.

During the FDA review, the tradename of the drug for the US market was changed from &quot;Glivec&quot; to &quot;Gleevec&quot; at the request of the FDA, to avoid confusion with Glyset, a diabetes drug.

A Swiss patent application was filed on imatinib and various salts on in April 1992, which was then filed in the EU, the US, and other countries in March and April 1993. and in 1996 United States and European patent offices issued patents listing Jürg Zimmermann as the inventor.

In July 1997, Novartis filed a new patent application in Switzerland on the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate (the mesylate salt of imatinib). The &quot;beta crystalline form&quot; of the molecule is a specific polymorph of imatinib mesylate; a specific way that the individual molecules pack together to form a solid. This is the actual form of the drug sold as Gleevec/Glivec; a salt (imatinib mesylate) as opposed to a free base, and the beta crystalline form as opposed to the alpha or other form. In 1998, Novartis filed international patent applications claiming priority to the 1997 filing. A United States patent was granted in 2005.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
In 2013, more than 100 cancer specialists published a letter in &quot;Blood&quot; saying that the prices of many new cancer drugs, including imatinib, are so high that people in the United States could not afford them, and that the level of prices, and profits, was so high as to be immoral. Signatories of the letter included Brian Druker, Carlo Gambacorti-Passerini, and John Goldman, developers of imatinib. They wrote that in 2001, imatinib was priced at a year, which was based on the price of interferon, then the standard treatment, and that at this price Novartis would have recouped its initial development costs in two years. They wrote that after unexpectedly becoming a blockbuster, Novartis increased the price to per year in 2012, with annual revenues of $4.7 billion. Other physicians have complained about the cost.

Druker, who led the clinical studies, never received any royalties or profits from the success of the drug.

By 2016, the average wholesale price had increased to a year, according to an analysis prepared for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; by Stacie Dusetzina of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. When competitive drugs came on the market, they were sold at a higher price to reflect the smaller population, and Novartis raised the price of Gleevec to match them.

A 2012 economic analysis funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb estimated that the discovery and development of imatinib and related drugs had created $143 billion in societal value at a cost to consumers of approximately $14 billion. The $143 billion figure was based on an estimated 7.5 to 17.5 year survival advantage conferred by imatinib treatment, and included the value (discounted at 3% per annum) of ongoing benefits to society after the imatinib patent expiration.

Prices for a 100 mg pill of Gleevec internationally range from $20 to $30, although generic imatinib is cheaper, as low as $2 per pill.

===Controversies===
====Patent litigation in India====
Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent Gleevec in India, and took the case all the way to the Indian Supreme Court. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the World Trade Organization and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the TRIPS agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law, the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis&#x27; patent application waited in a &quot;mailbox&quot; with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect.

The patent application claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib mesylate). In 1993, during the time India did not allow patents on products, Novartis had patented imatinib, with salts vaguely specified, in many countries but could not patent it in India. The key differences between the two patent applications, were that 1998 patent application specified the counterion (Gleevec is a specific salt – imatinib mesylate) while the 1993 patent application did not claim any specific salts nor did it mention mesylate, and the 1998 patent application specified the solid form of Gleevec – the way the individual molecules are packed together into a solid when the drug itself is manufactured (this is separate from processes by which the drug itself is formulated into pills or capsules) – while the 1993 patent application did not. The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline.

As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003. Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India.

When examination of Novartis&#x27; patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from oppositions initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if &quot;they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.&quot; At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Section 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal. Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India&#x27;s Supreme Court, which took the case.

The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Section 3d. The Supreme Court issued its decision in 2013, ruling that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts.

==Research==
One study demonstrated that imatinib mesylate was effective in patients with systemic mastocytosis, including those who had the D816V mutation in c-KIT. However, since imatinib binds to tyrosine kinases when they are in the inactive configuration and the D816V mutant of c-KIT is constitutively active, imatinib does not inhibit the kinase activity of the D816V mutant of c-KIT. Experience has shown, however, that imatinib is much less effective in patients with this mutation, and patients with the mutation comprise nearly 90% of cases of mastocytosis.

Imatinib was initially thought to have a potential role in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. It was shown to reduce both the smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pulmonary vasculature in a variety of disease processes, including portopulmonary hypertension. However, a long-term trial of Imatinib in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension was unsuccessful, and serious and unexpected adverse events were frequent. These included 6 subdural hematomas and 17 deaths during or within 30 days of study end.

In systemic sclerosis, the drug has been tested for potential use in slowing down pulmonary fibrosis. In laboratory settings, imatinib is being used as an experimental agent to suppress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) by inhibiting its receptor (PDGF-Rβ). One of its effects is delaying atherosclerosis in mice without or with diabetes.

Mouse animal studies have suggested that imatinib and related drugs may be useful in treating smallpox, should an outbreak ever occur.

&quot;In vitro&quot; studies identified that a modified version of imatinib can bind to gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP). GSAP selectively increases the production and accumulation of neurotoxic beta-amyloid plaques, which suggests that molecules which target GSAP and are able to cross blood–brain barrier are potential therapeutic agents for treating Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Another study suggests that imatinib may not need to cross the blood–brain barrier to be effective at treating Alzheimer&#x27;s, as the research indicates the production of beta-amyloid may begin in the liver. Tests on mice indicate that imatinib is effective at reducing beta-amyloid in the brain. It is not known whether reduction of beta-amyloid is a feasible way of treating Alzheimer&#x27;s, as an anti-beta-amyloid vaccine has been shown to clear the brain of plaques without having any effect on Alzheimer symptoms.

A formulation of imatinib with a cyclodextrin (Captisol) as a carrier to overcome the blood–brain barrier has shown reversal of opioid tolerance in a 2012 study in rats.

Imatinib is an experimental drug in the treatment of desmoid tumor or aggressive fibromatosis.

==Etymology==
The &quot;-tinib&quot; word stem makes reference to the drug&#x27;s action as a tyrosine kinase (TYK) inhibitor.

<text>The chief master sergeant of the Air Force (acronym: CMSAF) is a unique non-commissioned rank in the United States Air Force. The holder of this rank and position of office represents the highest enlisted level of leadership in the Air Force, unless an enlisted airman is serving as the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman. The CMSAF provides direction for the enlisted corps and represents their interests, as appropriate, to the American public, and to those in all levels of government. The CMSAF is appointed by the Air Force chief of staff (AF/CC) and serves as the senior enlisted advisor to the Air Force chief of staff and the secretary of the Air Force on all issues regarding the welfare, readiness, morale, and proper utilization and progress of the enlisted force.

The current 20th chief master sergeant of the Air Force is Chief David A. Flosi, who assumed the role on 8 March 2024.

The chief master sergeant of the Air Force is designated as a special paygrade above E-9, and although the CMSAF is a non-commissioned officer, protocol states that the CMSAF has precedence over all lieutenant generals at joint events, and over all lieutenant generals except the Air Force director of staff at Air Force–exclusive events.

==Rank insignia and positional colors==
On 1 November 2004, the CMSAF&#x27;s rank insignia was updated to include the Great Seal of the United States and two stars in the upper field. This puts the insignia in line with those of the Army and Marine Corps which have similar insignia to denote their senior enlisted servicemen. The laurel wreath around the star in the lower field remained unchanged, to retain the legacy of the Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force.

The CMSAF wears distinctive collar insignia. Traditionally, enlisted airmen&#x27;s collar insignia was silver-colored &quot;U.S.&quot; within a ring. The CMSAF&#x27;s collar brass replaced the standard ring with a silver laurel wreath. The CMSAF also wears a distinctive cap device. Enlisted airmen&#x27;s cap device is the Coat of Arms of the United States, surrounded by a ring, all struck from silver-colored metal. Much as with the position&#x27;s distinctive collar brass, the ring is replaced with a laurel wreath for the CMSAF.

The sergeant major of the Army, chief master sergeant of the Air Force, chief master sergeant of the Space Force, senior enlisted advisor to the chief of the National Guard Bureau, and the senior enlisted advisor to the chairman are the only members of the United States armed forces below the rank of brigadier general/rear admiral (lower half) to be authorized a positional color (flag). The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force colors were authorized in January 2013.

The official term of address for the CMSAF is &quot;Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force&quot; or &quot;Chief.&quot;

<doc id="561845" wikidata="Q504448" url="?curid=561845" title="Jacob Bekenstein">
<text>Jacob David Bekenstein (; May 1, 1947 – August 16, 2015) was a Mexican-born American-Israeli theoretical physicist who made fundamental contributions to the foundation of black hole thermodynamics and to other aspects of the connections between information and gravitation.

==Early life and education ==
Jacob Bekenstein was born in Mexico City to Joseph and Esther (&quot;née&quot; Vladaslavotsky), Polish Jews who immigrated to Mexico. He moved to the United States during his early life, gaining U.S. citizenship in 1968. He was also a citizen of Israel.

Bekenstein attended the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now known as the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, obtaining both an undergraduate degree and a Master of Science degree in 1969. He went on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Princeton University, working under the direction of John Archibald Wheeler, in 1972.

Bekenstein had three children with his wife, Bilha. All three children, Yehonadav, Uriya and Rivka Bekenstein, became scientists. Bekenstein was known as a religious man and a believer, being quoted as saying: &quot;I look at the world as a product of God, He set very specific laws and we delight in discovering them through scientific work.&quot;

==Scientific career==
By 1972, Bekenstein had published three influential papers about the black hole stellar phenomenon, postulating the no-hair theorem and presenting a theory on black hole thermodynamics. In the years to come, Bekenstein continued his exploration of black holes, publishing papers on their entropy and quantum mass.

Bekenstein was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin from 1972 to 1974. He then immigrated to Israel to lecture and teach at Ben-Gurion University in Beersheba. In 1978, he became a full professor and in 1983, head of the astrophysics department.

In 1990, he became a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and was appointed head of its theoretical physics department three years later. He was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1997. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 2009 and 2010.

In addition to lectures and residencies around the world, Bekenstein continued to serve as Polak professor of theoretical physics at the Hebrew University until his death at the age of 68, in Helsinki, Finland. He died unexpectedly on August 16, 2015, just months after receiving the American Physical Society&#x27;s Einstein Prize &quot;for his ground-breaking work on black hole entropy, which launched the field of black hole thermodynamics and transformed the long effort to unify quantum mechanics and gravitation&quot;.

==Contributions to physics==
In 1972, Bekenstein was the first to suggest that black holes should have a well-defined entropy. He wrote that a black hole&#x27;s entropy was proportional to the area of its (the black hole&#x27;s) event horizon. Bekenstein also formulated the generalized second law of thermodynamics, black hole thermodynamics, for systems including black holes. Both contributions were affirmed when Stephen Hawking (and, independently, Zeldovich and others) proposed the existence of Hawking radiation two years later. Hawking had initially opposed Bekenstein&#x27;s idea on the grounds that a black hole could not radiate energy and therefore could not have entropy. However, in 1974, Hawking performed a lengthy calculation that convinced him that particles can indeed be emitted from black holes. Today this is known as Hawking radiation. Bekenstein&#x27;s doctoral adviser, John Archibald Wheeler, also worked with him to develop the no-hair theorem, a reference to Wheeler&#x27;s saying that &quot;black holes have no hair,&quot; in the early 1970s. Bekenstein&#x27;s suggestion was proven unstable, but it was influential in the development of the field.

Based on his black-hole thermodynamics work, Bekenstein also demonstrated the Bekenstein bound: there is a maximum to the amount of information that can potentially be stored in a given finite region of space which has a finite amount of energy (which is similar to the holographic principle).

In 1982, Bekenstein developed a rigorous framework to generalize the laws of electromagnetism to handle inconstant physical constants. His framework replaces the fine-structure constant by a scalar field. However, this framework for changing constants did not incorporate gravity.

In 2004, Bekenstein boosted Mordehai Milgrom&#x27;s theory of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) by developing a relativistic version. It is known as TeVeS for Tensor/Vector/Scalar and it introduces three different fields in space time to replace the one gravitational field.

<doc id="561846" wikidata="Q4347194" url="?curid=561846" title="Palm Beach, New South Wales">
<text>Palm Beach is a suburb in the Northern Beaches region of Greater Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Palm Beach is located north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Northern Beaches Council. Palm Beach sits on a peninsula at the end of Barrenjoey Road near Pittwater and is the northernmost beach in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan area. The population of Palm Beach was 1,593 as at the .

Palm Beach is sometimes colloquially referred to as &#x27;Palmy&#x27;; it is used for exterior filming of the soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot;, as the fictional town of Summer Bay. It is also the subject of the 2018 film &#x27;Palm Beach&#x27;. Despite the hefty property prices it remains a haven for a variety of artists. Writing celebrating this beach is featured in &quot;Guide to Sydney Beaches&quot; Meuse Press. Palm Beach housing ranges from cottages to grand estates, owned by some of the country&#x27;s most affluent people. Many affluent and famous people can also be found holidaying at Palm Beach in summer. According to the Australian Taxation Office statistics for the financial year of 2016–2017, Palm Beach and the post code of 2108 was the wealthiest suburb in Australia, with an average taxable income of $230,000.

==Geography==
Palm Beach is bounded by Broken Bay to the north, the Tasman Sea (within the South Pacific Ocean) to the east, Whale Beach, Avalon and Clareville to the south, and Pittwater to the west. Barrenjoey Headland, which is in the north of the suburb, is part of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. The headland at the northernmost point rises quite sharply from the beach to over above sea level, and features an operational lighthouse. The narrow sandy isthmus or tombolo linking the south side of the headland to the rest of Palm Beach had extensive fencing and shrub planting undertaken during the 1980s to combat sand erosion.

===Localities===
The suburb of Palm Beach also contains the following localities: Barrenjoey, Sand Point, Careel Bay, Paradise Beach, and North Avalon.

===Reserves and bushland===
Along the cliffs and sanddunes there is much remnant bushland vegetation, located in reserves and national parks, with Barrenjoey headland being part of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. These reserves often contain endangered ecological communities, such as &quot;Littoral Rainforest&quot;, and &quot;Pittwater spotted gum forest&quot;. See, for example, the articles, McKay Reserve, and Barrenjoey.

===Landmarks===

Landmarks include the Barrenjoey Lighthouse, Palm Beach-Boanbong Water Reservoir, Palm Beach-McKay Water Reservoir, Palm Beach-Squaters Lodge, Blueberry Ash, and Iluka Resort Apartments.

The long east-facing eponymous beach curves in a gentle arc between the prominent high, lighthouse capped, Barrenjoey Head to the sandstone rocks of Little Head in the south, beach linking Barrenjoey to the mainland. North Palm Beach extends south from Barrenjoey, with the northern backed by a wide densely vegetated foredune. The southern Palm Beach section includes the southern of beach, which curves to the southeast in the southern Kiddies Corner. It receives increasing protection from Little Head with waves decreasing in height down the beach. Rips usually extend all the way to the head, though usually smaller in size, with a weak permanent rip against the southern rocks.

==History==

===Origin of the name===
The southern end of the Palm Beach is marked as Cabbage Tree Boat Harbour on a map of 1832. Palm Beach was later named after the Cabbage Tree palms &quot;Livistona australis&quot; that were near Cabbage Tree Boat Harbour. The plant&#x27;s species name gave origin to Livistona Lane, off Palm Beach Road.

===European settlement===
Governor Philip explored the area in 1788, and named the headland &#x27;Barrenjuee&#x27;, which was an indigenous word apparently meaning &#x27;young kangaroo&#x27;. In 1816, Palm Beach, Barrenjoey and most of Whale Beach () was granted to James Napper. During the 19th century, a few Europeans and Chinese lived at Snapperman Beach catching and drying fish. The Southern end of the ocean beach is marked as Cabbage Tree Boat Harbour on a map of 1832. Palm Beach was later named after the Cabbage Tree palms &quot;Livistona australis&quot;.

In 1900 all land, except Barrenjoey Headland, which had been purchased by the government in 1881, was divided into 18 large blocks, listed as good grazing land, and offered for sale. None sold. In 1912, the land was offered again in smaller residential blocks, offering fishing, sailing, golf and rowing. Most houses were built from local sandstone, other materials were shipped in. Some were guest houses but most were second homes for those who could afford them.

Palm Beach wharf was the terminus reached by boat from Newport or Bayview. Hordern and Wiltshire Parks and Mackay Reserve were donated by RJ Hordern, who lived at Kalua, opposite the beach. Since World War II the area has become more residential but still remains a secluded peninsula at the northern point of Pittwater.

<doc id="561852" wikidata="Q178643" url="?curid=561852" title="Süleymaniye Mosque">
<text>The Süleymaniye Mosque (, ) is an Ottoman imperial mosque located on the Third Hill of Istanbul, Turkey. The mosque was commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent () and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. An inscription specifies the foundation date as 1550 and the inauguration date as 1557, although work on the complex probably continued for a few years after this. 

The Süleymaniye Mosque is one of the best-known sights of Istanbul and from its location on the Third Hill it commands an extensive view of the city around the Golden Horn. It is considered a masterpiece of Ottoman architecture and one of Mimar Sinan&#x27;s greatest works. It is the largest Ottoman-era mosque in the city. 

Like other Ottoman imperial foundations, the mosque is part of a larger &quot;külliye&quot; (religious and charitable complex) which included madrasas, a public kitchen, and a hospital, among others. Behind the &quot;qibla&quot; wall of the mosque is an enclosed cemetery containing the separate octagonal mausoleums of Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Hurrem Sultan (Roxelana).

==History==

=== Construction ===

Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent chose the architect Mimar Sinan to create a mosque in memory of his son Şehzade (Crown Prince) Mehmed. Suleiman was so impressed with the ensuing Şehzade Mosque (Şehzade Cami) that he asked Sinan to design a mosque for himself too. This mosque would represent the pre-eminence of the Ottoman Empire.

The mosque was built on the site of the old Ottoman palace (&quot;Eski Saray&quot;) which was still in use at the time and had to be demolished. The Arabic inscription above the entrance to the prayer hall gives a foundation date of 1550 and an inauguration date of 1557. In reality, the planning of the mosque began before 1550 and parts of the complex were not completed until after 1557. The final construction expenses were recorded in 1559, relating to some of the madrasas and to the mausoleum of Suleiman&#x27;s wife, Hürrem Sultan (d. 1558). The mausoleum for Suleiman himself was built after his death on the orders of his son and successor, Selim II, between 1566 and 1568.

Marble spolia from various sites in Constantinople and other parts of the empire were reportedly gathered and shipped to the construction site. Petrus Gyllius, a contemporary observer, wrote about seeing one of the four enormous porphyry columns destined for the mosque&#x27;s interior being cut down to size and about marble columns being taken from the Hippodrome.

In designing the Süleymaniye Mosque, Sinan took inspiration from the Hagia Sophia and the Bayezid II Mosque. Suleiman&#x27;s intention was to build a mosque that would surpass all others built by his predecessors. Suleiman appears to have represented himself at times as a &quot;second Solomon&quot; and his construction projects in both Jerusalem and Constantinople (Istanbul) appear to reflect this. Architecturally, Suleiman&#x27;s mausoleum (built behind the mosque) references the Dome of the Rock, which was built on the site of the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. According to popular tradition, Justinian I boasted upon the completion of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople: &quot;Solomon, I have surpassed thee!&quot; Suleiman&#x27;s mosque, in turn, references the Hagia Sophia in its layout.

=== Damages and restorations ===

The Süleymaniye was damaged in the great fire of 1660 and was restored by Sultan Mehmed IV. Part of the dome collapsed during the earthquake of 1766. Repairs damaged what was left of Sinan&#x27;s original decoration (recent cleaning has shown that he experimented with blue, before making red the dominant colour of the dome).

During World War I the courtyard was used as a weapons depot, and when some of the ammunition ignited, the mosque suffered another fire. Not until 1956 was it fully restored. The mosque was restored again between 2007 and 2010. Parts of the surrounding complex continued to be restored in the decade following.

==Architecture==
===Courtyard===
Like the other imperial mosques in Istanbul, the entrance to the mosque is preceded by a forecourt with a central fountain. The main front gate, on the northwest side of the mosque, projects outward from and above the walls on either side. The entrance portal consists of a recess covered by a triangular vault sculpted with &quot;muqarnas&quot;, with slender pilasters on either side. Above the &quot;muqarnas&quot; canopy is an inscription featuring the Sunni version of the &quot;shahada&quot; (profession of faith). The windows on either side of the portal mark the presence of interior rooms which housed the &quot;muvakkithane&quot; (chamber of the timekeeper). 

The courtyard, measuring around , is of exceptional grandeur with a colonnaded peristyle supported by tall columns of marble, granite and porphyry. The columns are topped by classic Ottoman &quot;stalactite&quot; capitals (carved with &quot;muqarnas&quot;). On the southeast side of the courtyard, the portico preceding the prayer hall is higher than those on the other three sides, giving this façade a greater monumentality. The three center arches of the northwest portico, corresponding to the front entrance, are also higher than the other arches around them. According to Godfrey Goodwin, reconciling these elements of different heights along the peristyle was Sinan&#x27;s main aesthetic difficulty. The facade of the prayer hall is also decorated with rectangular Iznik tile window lunettes. It was the first building in which the Iznik tiles included the brightly coloured tomato-red clay under the glaze.

The mosque is equipped with water taps outside the courtyard, between the side entrances of the prayer hall, which are used for performing ablutions. As a result, the drinking fountain in the center of the courtyard is purely decorative. It is a rectangular marble enclosure with a ceiling. The fountain was designed so that water sprayed from the ceiling into the basin below, an unusual feature noted by some 16th-century writers.

Behind the southeast portico, the main entrance to the prayer hall is set within a recess with a complex &quot;muqarnas&quot; canopy. This is preceded by a dome with a more distinctive design than the other domes of the peristyle. The entrance portal features a foundation inscription carved onto three rectangular panels (two vertical panels on the side and an horizontal one on top). The text was composed by Ebussuud Efendi and its calligraphy, in &quot;thuluth&quot; script, was created by Hasan Çelebi, a student of Ahmed Karahisari. It states the sultan&#x27;s name and titles, his genealogy, and a prayer for the continuation of the Ottoman dynasty. The wooden doors of the entrance are made of carved wood, including walnut, ebony, and olive wood, and they are inlaid with ivory and mother-of-pearl.

The side entrances of the mosque courtyard have inscriptions as well. The western gate to the courtyard has an inscription reading, &quot;Peace be unto thee! Thou art good, so enter ye to dwell therein&quot; (Quran 39:73). The other entrances of the mosque have similar inscriptions which compare its gates with the gates of paradise.

=== Minarets ===

Four minarets occupy the four corners of the courtyard. The two taller ones have three balconies and rise to a high of without their lead caps and including the caps. The balconies are supported by consoles carved with &quot;muqarnas&quot; and they have balustrades carved and pierced with geometric patterns. 

The use of four minarets at the corners of a mosque courtyard had been done previously at the Üç Şerefeli Mosque in Edirne, although Sinan introduced a strict symmetry not present in the earlier example. In the history of Ottoman architecture, this many minarets were only added to some mosques endowed by a sultan (princes and princesses could construct two minarets; others only one). The minarets have a total of ten balconies, which is said to reflect the fact that Suleiman I was the 10th Ottoman sultan. By making the outer minarets shorter than the inner ones, Sinan also increased the overall visual impression of a structure rising towards the central dome.

===Prayer hall===

==== Overall design ====

The interior of the mosque is almost a square, measuring , forming a single vast space dominated by its central dome. The dome is high and has a diameter of which is exactly half the height. The square space directly below this dome occupies exactly half the total area of the prayer hall. The layout emulates the dome design of the Hagia Sophia and also follows the layout of the earlier Bayezid II Mosque: the central dome is flanked by semi-domes both in front and behind, covering the main central space, while a row of smaller and lower domes covers each of the two lateral aisles on either side. Between these smaller domes and the main dome are large tympanas filled with windows. This repetition of an older building plan is uncharacteristic of Sinan and may have been the result of Suleiman&#x27;s personal wishes.

Sinan refined the design by repeating the innovations he had previously used in the Şehzade Mosque. The dome and semi-domes are supported by a limited number of load-bearing pillars and buttresses, allowing for more windows in the walls between them and minimizing any obstructive divisions within the prayer space. He dissimulated many of the load-bearing buttresses by incorporating them into the outer walls, where they project partly inwards and partly outwards so as to make them appear less massive from either side. He built colonnaded galleries between them both on the outside and on the inside, thus further obscuring their presence. Because the supporting buttresses are dissimulated within the walls of the building, they do not dominate and obscure its profile as they do at the Hagia Sophia. Thus, on the outside, the arrangement of arches, turrets, and semi-domes forms a more harmonious, almost pyramid-like progression to the central dome, emphasizing the latter as the visual culmination of the structure. The exception to this is the southeast wall (facing the cemetery), where the buttresses are fully situated on the outside in order to maintain a flat surface for the &quot;qibla&quot; wall on the inside.

Sinan also introduced greater variety and detail to the mosque&#x27;s design than in previous works. For example, in the domes covering the lateral aisles, he alternated between domes of different sizes, thus introducing a certain visual rhythm. The spaces in front of the side entrances of the prayer hall, between the pairs of massive buttresses at the corners of the building, are also covered by domes of alternating designs: a circular dome in the middle flanked by two smaller elliptical domes on the side. Moreover, by adding these four side entrances at the corners – instead of two side entrances at the middle of the lateral walls, as was done in the Şehzade Mosque – Sinan found a better use for these corner areas that were typically neglected or omitted in other centrally-planned buildings. On the outside, the two level-galleries have wide projecting eaves which shelter water taps used for ablutions, another innovation.
==== Decoration ====

The interior decoration is restrained and this seems to have been deliberate on Sinan&#x27;s part. The documents of the mosque&#x27;s &quot;waqf&quot; (religious endowment) explicitly claim that ostentatious ornamentation of gold or jewels was avoided in order to conform with the traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It&#x27;s possible that Suleiman and Sinan regarded calligraphy as the primary form of decoration, in the spirit of a period when the Ottoman sultan championed a more austere Sunni orthodoxy. The calligraphy of the mosque is almost entirely in monumental &quot;thuluth&quot; form and is attributed to Hasan Çelebi, whom Sinan may have favoured.

Most or all of the mosque&#x27;s original painted decoration has been destroyed in the course of later damages and repairs. Very little is known directly about the original painted decoration. The present-day painting of the central dome dates from a 19th-century restoration by the Fossati brothers, who chose to roughly imitate Ottoman Baroque decoration. Traces of the original decoration were found during 20th-century cleaning and suggest that blue colours were used before Sinan replaced them with predominantly red colours. The Fossati-era painting has been maintained in more recent restorations as it is now considered part of the mosque&#x27;s history. Elsewhere, the voussoirs of the mosque&#x27;s stone arches are painted in red and white to imitate marble. Except for the inscriptions carved in stone, most of the other calligraphy found throughout the mosque is painted and was thus likely restored in later periods. The restorations appear to have been careful and probably retain some aspects of the original compositions.

The stonework of the mosque is of high quality. The columns have classic Ottoman &quot;stalactite&quot; or &quot;muqarnas&quot;-carved capitals. On both the front and back sides of the four main pillars are tall and sharply-pointed &quot;muqarnas&quot; niches. Water faucets are also set into the pillars. 

The &quot;mihrab&quot; consists of the traditional niche with a &quot;muqarnas&quot; hood. This is framed inside a marble surface in the same shape as the central (northwest) gate of the mosque&#x27;s courtyard (aligned on the same axis as the &quot;mihrab&quot;). The edges of this simple marble composition are sculpted into fluted columns that terminate at the top with crescent symbols, while an arabesque runs along the top edge in between.

Next to the &quot;mihrab&quot; is the &quot;minbar&quot;, which is crafted in traditional Ottoman form: a narrow staircase, with triangular sides, climbing from a portal to a canopy. The decoration is simplified in comparison with more ornate Ottoman examples, limited to the geometric patterning of the balustrades and the gilded stars on a blue ground covering the conical cap of the canopy. Located nearby are a simple platform or balcony for the sultan (&quot;hünkar mahfili&quot;) and another platform for the muezzin (&quot;muezzin mahfili&quot;), all made of marble with only a few discrete embellishments. 

Iznik tile revetments are only used around the &quot;mihrab&quot;. The repeating rectangular tiles have a stencil-like floral pattern on a white ground. The flowers are mainly blue with turquoise, red, and black, but green is not used. On either side of the &quot;mihrab&quot; are large Iznik-tile calligraphic roundels with text from the Al-Fatiha surah of the Quran .

The most elaborate stained-glass windows are found on the &quot;qibla&quot; wall, near the &quot;mihrab&quot;. They are generally believed to have been the work of Sarhos Ibrahim, but some of the present-day windows have likely been restored at later periods. They are designed to display the names of God (Allah), the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the four Rashidun caliphs. 

The names of God and Muhammad are repeated in inscriptions above the lower windows, emphasizing God as the source of Islamic law (Shari&#x27;a) and Muhammad as the preacher of that law. The names of the four caliphs are also repeated on the mosque&#x27;s four main pillars, recalling the four pillars of Sunni theology. The selection of these inscriptions, along with others across the mosque, emphasize the orthodox Sunni character of the mosque, reflecting in part the Ottoman rivalry with the contemporary Safavids, the main Shi&#x27;a dynasty to the east.

== Complex ==

===Mausoleums===
Behind the &quot;qibla&quot; wall (southeast wall) of the mosque is an enclosed cemetery which contains the separate mausoleums (&quot;türbe&quot;) of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife Hürrem Sultan (Roxelana).

The large octagonal mausoleum of Suleiman the Magnificent bears the date of 1566, the year of his death, but it was probably not completed until the following year. It is one of the largest Ottoman mausoleums and its design has been compared to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, on which it may have been modeled on the latter. The mausoleum is surrounded by a peristyle (portico) with a projecting roof supported by 24 columns; the entrance faces towards the east rather than the usual north. Beneath the portico on either side of the entrance are Iznik tiled panels. These are the earliest known tiles decorated with the bright emerald green colour that would become a common feature of Iznik ceramics. The dome, 14 meters in diameter, is the first major example of a double-shelled dome in Sinan&#x27;s architecture. The interior has a false dome supported on eight columns within the outer shell. There are 14 windows at ground level and an additional 24 windows with stained glass set in the tympana under the arches. The walls and pendentives are covered with polychrome Iznik tiles. Above the windows runs a band of inscriptive tiled panels. The text quotes the Throne verse and the following two verses from the Quran . In addition to the tomb of Suleiman the Magnificent, the mausoleum houses the tomb of his daughter Mihrimah Sultan and those of two later sultans: Suleiman II (ruled 1687–1691) and Ahmed II (ruled 1691–1695).

Hurrem Sultan&#x27;s octagonal mausoleum is dated 1558, the year of her death. The 16-sided interior is decorated with Iznik tiles. The seven rectangular windows are surmounted by tiled lunettes and epigraphic panels. Between the windows are eight &quot;mihrab&quot;-like hooded niches. The ceiling is now whitewashed but was probably once painted in bright colours.

===Other buildings===
As with other imperial mosques in Istanbul, the Süleymaniye Mosque was designed as a &quot;külliye&quot;, or complex, with adjacent structures to service both religious and cultural needs. The mosque incorporates the everyday needs for an Islamic community such as prayer, education, health and much more. Due to the sloping nature of the site around the mosque, many of the structures are built above massive substructures that created a more level ground. Vaulted rooms existed in these substructures and were probably put to various uses. 

The original complex consisted of the mosque itself, four madrasas or religious colleges (&quot;medrese&quot;), a small primary school (&quot;mekteb&quot;), a medical school (&quot;darüttıb&quot;), a hospital (&quot;darüşşifa&quot; or &quot;timarhane&quot;), a public kitchen (&quot;imaret&quot;) that served food to the poor, a caravanserai or guesthouse (&quot;tabhane&quot;), public baths (&quot;hamam&quot;), a specialized school (&quot;darülhadis&quot;) for the learning of &quot;hadith&quot;, a small domed building for the employees of the cemetery (attached to the latter&#x27;s southeast wall), and rows of small shops integrated into the outer edges and along the street on the southwest side of the mosque. Many of these structures are still in existence. The former imaret has been converted into a restaurant. The former hospital is now a printing factory owned by the Turkish Army. Just outside the complex walls, to the north is the tomb of architect Sinan. It was completely restored in 1922. 

Most of the buildings are classical Ottoman courtyard structures consisting of a rectangular courtyard surrounded by a domed peristyle portico giving access to domed rooms. In the madrasas, Sinan modified some details of the typical layout for functional reasons. The Salis Medrese and Rabı Medrese, located on the northeast side of the mosque where the ground slopes down towards the Golden Horn, have a &quot;stepped&quot; design in which the courtyard descends in three terraces connected by stairs while the domed rooms are built at progressively lower levels alongside it. The current remains of the &quot;hadith&quot; school (&quot;darülhadis&quot;) have been crudely restored. It consists of a long line of small vaulted rooms on the eastern edge of the complex. According to Doğan Kuban, the original school must have had a different appearance. The triangular plaza between this structure and the courtyard was once used for weekly wrestling matches.

The two other madrasas, on the southwest side, are known as the Sani Medrese and Evvel Medrese and have regular floor plans on flatter ground. Of the medical school (&quot;darüttıb&quot; or Tıp Medrese) next to these, not much has survived except for the rooms on the northeast side. All three of these madrasas are fronted by shops on their northeast sides (the sides facing the mosque), which contributed revenues to the complex. This created a market street known as the &quot;Tiryaki Çarșısı&quot;, the &quot;Antidote Market&quot;, due to the former presence of coffee houses and shops devoted to the smoking of hashish. A small primary school (&quot;sibyan mekteb&quot;), consisting of two domed rooms, is attached to the eastern corner of the Evvel Medrese, though separated from the main building by a narrow garden.

<text>Umber is a natural earth pigment consisting of iron oxide and manganese oxide; it has a brownish color that can vary among shades of yellow, red, and green. Umber is considered one of the oldest pigments known to humans, first seen in Ajanta Caves in 200 BC – 600 AD. Umber&#x27;s advantages are its highly versatile color, warm tone, and quick drying abilities. While some sources indicate that umber&#x27;s name comes from its geographic origin in Umbria, other scholars suggest that it derives from the Latin word &quot;umbra&quot;, which means &quot;shadow&quot;. The belief that its name derives from the word for shadow is fitting, as the color helps create shadows. The color is primarily produced in Cyprus. Umber is typically mined from open pits or underground mines and ground into a fine powder that is washed to remove impurities. In the 20th century, the rise of synthetic dyes decreased the demand for natural pigments such as umber.

==History==
The earliest documented uses of umber date from between 200 BC and 600 AD in the Ajanta Caves found in India. Ocher, a family of earth pigments which includes umber, has been identified in the caves of Altamira in Spain and the Lascaux Cave in France. Some sources indicate that umber was not frequently used in medieval art because of its emphasis on bright and vivid colors. Other sources indicate, however, that umber was used in the Middle Ages to create different shades of brown, most often seen for skin tones. Umber&#x27;s use in Europe increased in the late 15th century. Umber became more popular during the Renaissance when its versatility, earthy appearance, availability, and inexpensiveness were recognized.

Umber gained widespread popularity in Dutch landscape painting in the eighteenth century. Artists recognized the value of umber&#x27;s high stability, inertness, and drying abilities. It became a standard color within eighteenth-century palettes throughout Europe. Umber&#x27;s popularity grew during the Baroque period with the rise of the chiaroscuro style. Umber allowed painters to create an intense light and dark contrast. Underpainting was another popular technique for painting that used umber as a base color. Umber was valuable in deploying this technique, creating a range of earth like tones with various layering of color.

Toward the end of the 19th century, the Impressionist movement started to use cheaper and more readily available synthetic dyes and reject natural pigments like umber to create mixed hues of brown. The Impressionists chose to make their own browns from mixtures of red, yellow, green, blue and other pigments, particularly the new synthetic pigments such as cobalt blue and emerald green that had just been introduced. In the 20th century, natural umber pigments began to be replaced by pigments made with synthetic iron oxide and manganese oxide.

== Criticism ==
Beginning in the 17th century, umber was increasingly criticized within the art community. British painter Edward Norgate, prominent with British royalty and aristocracy, called umber &quot;a foul and greasy color.&quot; In the 18th century, Spanish painter Antonio Palomino called umber &quot;very false.&quot; Jan Blockx, a Belgian painter, opined, &quot;umber should not appear on the palette of the conscientious painter.&quot;

== Visual properties ==
Umber is a natural brown pigment extracted from clay containing iron, manganese, and hydroxides. Umber has diverse hues, ranging from yellow-brown to reddish-brown and even green-brown. The color shade varies depending on the proportions of the components. When heated, umber becomes a more intense color and can look almost black. Burnt umber is produced by calcining the raw version. The raw form of umber is typically used for ceramics because it is less expensive.

These warm and earthy tones make it a valuable and versatile pigment for oil painting and other artwork. Umber&#x27;s high opacity and reactivity of light allow the pigment to have strong hiding power. It is insoluble in water, resistant to alkalis and weak acids, and non-reactive with cement, solvents, oils, and most resins. Umber is known for its stability.
== Notable occurrences ==

Umber became widely used throughout the Renaissance period for oil paintings. In the Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci used umber for the brown tones throughout his subject&#x27;s hair and clothing. Da Vinci also extensively used umber in his painting the Last Supper to create shadows and outlines of the figures. Throughout the Baroque period, many renowned painters used umber.

==Varieties==

===Raw umber===

This is the color raw umber.

===Burnt umber===
Burnt umber is made by heating raw umber, which dehydrates the iron oxides and changes them partially to the more reddish hematite. It is used for both oil and water color paint.

The first recorded use of &quot;burnt umber&quot; as a color name in English was in 1650.

<text>Michel Charles-Émile Trudeau (October 2, 1975 – November 13, 1998) was the youngest son of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and Margaret Trudeau and the younger brother of current Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He died in an avalanche on November 13, 1998, while skiing in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park.

== Biography ==
He was born at the Ottawa Civic Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario, and partially named after his paternal grandfather, Charles-Émile. Trudeau was known to family and friends as Miche, and he later started going by Mike. Trudeau lived his early life in Ottawa and later Montreal upon his father&#x27;s retirement from politics in 1984, where he was a classmate of Sophie Grégoire. During their summer breaks, Michel and his brothers attended Camp Ahmek on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Provincial Park where he would later work as a camp counsellor. He studied at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf before attending Dalhousie University to study marine biology. When talking about her sons each having distinctly different personalities in an interview in 1977, Margaret Trudeau said, &quot;Justin, 6, is a prince — a very good little boy. Sasha (Alexandre), born Christmas Day, 1973, is a bit of a revolutionary, very determined and strong-willed. Miche (Michel) is a happy, well-adjusted child, who combined the best traits of both brothers.&quot;

==Death==
Michel Trudeau died as the result of an avalanche on Friday November 13, 1998, aged 23. At the time, he had been working for about a year at Red Mountain Resort and living in Rossland, British Columbia. He was taking a backcountry skiing trip with some friends in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park when he was swept into Kokanee Lake and unable to reach the shore. His companions were unable to effect a rescue, and Trudeau presumably drowned. An extensive search was launched, but his body has never been found. The lake&#x27;s high elevation and limited days of open waters each year prevented divers from completing the search. The Trudeau family called off the recovery and later built a chalet nearby as a memorial to their youngest son.

A varietal of rose discovered by Betsy Dening, a British Columbia horticulturist and Trudeau&#x27;s aunt, debuted at the World Rose Festival in 2010 as the &quot;Michel Trudeau Memorial Rosebush&quot;. Sales of the rosebush benefit the Canadian Avalanche Foundation.

<doc id="561861" wikidata="Q209312" url="?curid=561861" title="Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)">
<text>The Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812) between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire was one of the Russo-Turkish Wars. Russia prevailed, but both sides wanted peace as they feared Napoleon&#x27;s moves to the east.

==Background==
The war broke out against the background of the Napoleonic Wars. In 1806, Sultan Selim III, encouraged by the Russian defeat at Austerlitz and advised by the French Empire, deposed the pro-Russian Constantine Ypsilantis as Hospodar of the Principality of Wallachia and Alexander Mourousis as Hospodar of Moldavia, both Ottoman vassal states. Simultaneously, the French Empire occupied Dalmatia and threatened to penetrate the Danubian principalities at any time. In order to safeguard the Russian border against a possible French attack, a 40,000-strong Russian contingent advanced into Moldavia and Wallachia. The Sultan reacted by blocking the Dardanelles to Russian ships and declared war on Russia.

==Early hostilities==
Initially, Emperor Alexander I was reluctant to concentrate large forces against the Ottoman Empire while his relations with Napoleonic France were still uncertain and the main part of his army was occupied fighting against Napoleon in Prussia. A massive Ottoman offensive aimed at Russian-occupied Bucharest, the Wallachian capital, was promptly checked at Obilesti by as few as 4,500 soldiers commanded by Mikhail Miloradovich (June 2, 1807). In Armenia, the 7,000-strong contingent of Count Gudovich destroyed the Turkish force of 20,000 at Arpachai (June 18). In the meantime, the Russian Imperial Navy under Dmitry Senyavin blockaded the Dardanelles and defeated the Ottoman fleet in the Battle of the Dardanelles, after which Selim III was deposed. The Ottoman fleet was destroyed the following month in the Battle of Athos, thus establishing Russian supremacy at sea.

==Campaigns of 1808–10==
At this point the war might have ended, if it were not for the Peace of Tilsit. The Russian Emperor, constrained by Napoleon to sign an armistice with the Turks, used the time of peace to transfer more Russian soldiers from Prussia to Bessarabia. After the southern army was augmented to 80,000 and the hostilities were resumed, the 76-year-old commander-in-chief Prozorovsky made little progress in more than a year. In August 1809 he was eventually succeeded by Prince Bagration, who promptly crossed the Danube and overran Dobruja. Bagration proceeded to lay siege to Silistra, at the village of Tataritsa, the army of the Ottoman pasha attacked it, the Russians repulsed the attacks, but could not capture the Turkish trenches, and upon learning of the arrival of reinforcements, they lifted the siege and retreated.

In 1810, the hostilities were renewed by the brothers Nikolay and Sergei Kamensky, who defeated the Ottoman reinforcement heading for Silistra and ousted the Turks from Hacıoğlu Pazarcık (May 22). The position of Silistra now appeared hopeless, and the garrison surrendered on May, 30. Ten days later, Kamensky laid siege to another strong fortress, Shumla (or Schumen). His storm of the citadel was repelled at great loss of life, and more bloodshed ensued during the storming of the Danubian port of Rousse (or Rustchuk) on 22 July. The latter fortress did not fall to the Russians until 9 September, after Kamensky&#x27;s army had surprised and routed a huge Turkish detachment at Batin on 26 August. On 26 October, Kamensky again defeated a 40,000-strong army of Osman Pasha at Vidin. The Russians lost only 1,500 men, compared with 10,000 for their opponents.

However, the young Nikolay Kamensky caught a serious illness on February 4, 1811 and died soon thereafter, left the army under the command of Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron. To this point, although the Russians had won many battles, they had failed to achieve any important victories that would force the Ottomans to end the war. Furthermore, relationship between France and Russia quickly became strained, pointing to the inevitable renewal of hostilities between the countries. The Russian Empire found that she needed to end the southern war quickly in order to concentrate on dealing with Napoleon. In such a situation, Tsar Alexander appointed his disfavoured general Mikhail Kutuzov to be the new commander of the Russian force.

== Kutuzov&#x27;s campaign (1811) ==

Kutuzov&#x27;s first action upon taking command was to reduce the size of the garrisons in the fortresses along the Danube and retreat back into Wallachia. The Russian withdrawal induced the Turks to launch a counter-offensive to recapture lost territory. In the spring of 1811, 60,000 Turkish troops led by Grand Vizier Ahmed Pasha gathered at Šumnu, the strongest fortress in Ottoman Bulgaria and set out on a campaign to confront Kutuzov&#x27;s army. Kutuzov&#x27;s army was also large with 46,000 soldiers, however, he was responsible for protecting the full 600 mile Danube River border between Wallachia and Ottoman Bulgaria.

On 22 June 1811, the two forces met in battle at Rusçuk on the Danube. After a long struggle, the Russians successfully repelled Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s larger army. A few days later as the Turks were preparing to attack the Russians in the Rusçuk fortress, Kutuzov ordered his forces to cross the Danube and retreat back into Wallachia.

Believing that the Russians were trying to escape, Ahmed Pasha decided to launch an attack. On 28 August, 36,000 Turkish troops began to cross the Danube River to assault the Russians. The Turkish force established a fortified bridgehead on the left bank of the river near the small village of Slobozia where they were quickly surrounded by two divisions of Kutuzov&#x27;s army. The remaining 20,000 men of Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s army remained at the Turkish field camp on the right bank near Rusçuk where they guarded the munitions and supplies. On the night of 1 October 1811, however, a Russian detachment of 7,500 men secretly crossed the Danube. In the morning the Russians overwhelmed the Turkish troops in a surprise attack. The Turks panicked and scattered, suffering 2,000 casualties. Thereafter, the Russian forces completely enveloped the Turkish bridgehead on the left bank of the Danube and initiated an all-out artillery attack.

For approximately six weeks, the Russians sieged and bombarded the Turkish bridgehead. Surrounded with their supply lines cut, the Turks suffered not only from a persistent Russian bombardment but also from malnutrition and disease. A ceasefire was agreed upon on 25 October and approximately three weeks later on 14 November 1811, Ahmed Pasha agreed to a truce and formally surrendered to Kutuzov. The magnitude of the Turkish defeat with 36,000 casualties, ended the war along the Danube and led to peace negotiations ultimately resulting in the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest on 28 May 1812.

==Caucasus front==

Six years of war on the eastern front left the border unchanged. Fighting here was more serious than during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, but it was still a sideshow to the main action. Russia crossed the Caucasus and annexed Georgia, the western half of which had been nominally Turkish. It also had taken the Persian vassal khanates along the Caspian coast and east of Georgia. The area around modern Armenia (Erivan Khanate and Nakhichevan Khanate) was still Persian. Russia was also at war with Persia but the Turks and Persians did not help each other. A large part of the Russian army was tied up because of Napoleon&#x27;s threat in the west. The Russian Viceroys were 1806: Ivan Gudovich, 1809: Alexander Tormasov, 1811: Filippo Paulucci, 1812: Nikolay Rtishchev.

Fighting with Turkey began in 1807 with the swift seizure of Anapa by Admiral Pustoshkin. Gudovich led his main force toward Akhaltsikhe but lost 900 men while trying to storm Akhalkalaki and withdrew to Georgia. Secondary campaigns against Kars and Poti also failed. The Turks took the offensive, failed three times to take Gyumri and then were completely defeated by Gudovich (Battle of Arpachai). He was congratulated by the Shah, an interesting comment on the relations between the two Muslim empires. Gudovich was replaced by Count Tormasov who arrived about April 1809. In 1810 Poti on the coast was captured. A Turkish invasion was blocked by General Paulucci under the walls of Akhalkalaki. In November 1810 a Russian attack on Akhaltsikhe failed due to an outbreak of plague. In 1811 Tormasov was recalled at his own request and replaced by Paulucci in Transcaucasia, Rtishchev taking over the Northern Line. In 1811 more troops were withdrawn to deal with the expected threat of Napoleon. Turks and Persians agreed on a joint attack toward Gyumri. They met at ’Magasberd’ {location?} on 30Aug11. There a Kurd assassinated the Serasker of Erzurum and this caused the forces to break up. 

Paulucci sent Pyotr Kotlyarevsky against Akhalkalaki. He made a forced march over the snow-covered mountains, avoiding the main roads, attacked at night, and had storming parties on the walls before the Turks knew the Russians were there. By the morning of 10 December he held the fort with a loss of only 30 killed and wounded. For this he was promoted to major-general at the age of 29. On 21 February 1812 5000 Turks failed to re-take Akhalkalaki. Three days later they were defeated at Parghita {location?}. Paulucci was sent west to command troops against Napoleon, and Rtishchev became commander of forces on both sides of the Caucasus mountains. 
Russia decided to make peace, which was signed by the Treaty of Bucharest (1812).

==Aftermath==

According to the Treaty, the Ottoman Empire ceded the eastern half of Moldavia to Russia (which renamed the territory to Bessarabia), specifically, the territories east of Danube and Prut rivers, even though the Ottoman Empire had committed to protecting that region. Russia became a new power in the lower Danube area, and had an economically, diplomatically, and militarily profitable frontier. 

In Transcaucasia, Turkey regained nearly all it had lost in the east: Poti, Anapa and Akhalkalali. Russia retained Sukhum-Kale on the Abkhazian coast. In return, the Sultan accepted the Russian annexation of the Kingdom of Imereti, in 1810.

The treaty was approved by Alexander I of Russia on June 11, some 13 days before Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia began. The commanders were able to get many of the Russian soldiers in the Balkans back to the western areas before the expected attack of Napoleon.

<text>Eastern Creek is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Eastern Creek is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the Blacktown local government area and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.

Eastern Creek is west of the Prospect Reservoir and is most notable for containing Sydney Motorsport Park (previously known as Eastern Creek Raceway), the Western Sydney International Dragway, and the former site of Wonderland Sydney amusement park.

==History==
The origin of the suburb&#x27;s name lies in the fact the eastern branch of South Creek became known as Eastern Creek. The village that then grew where the road crossed the creek became known as Eastern Creek.

==Population==
In the 2021 Census, there were 874 people in Eastern Creek. 60.1% of people were born in Australia and 56.6% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 27.2% and No Religion 20.7%.

==Commercial areas==

Eastern Creek features many industrial developments and often the description &#x27;Eastern Creek Area&#x27; also includes the industrial developments in the neighbouring suburbs of Arndell Park and Huntingwood. With this in mind most statistics and demographic information is not available for this suburb by itself. Eastern Creek Waste and Recycling Centre also takes up a large part of the suburb.

==Recreation==
Sydney Motorsport Park has hosted V8 Supercars events and hosted the Top Gear Festival on 8 and 9 March 2014. The Western Sydney International Dragway is located next to it.

Wonderland Sydney was a large amusement park that operated here between 1985 and 2004. Wonderland is now the site of a business park called Interchange Park.

The Western Sydney Parklands lies to the west of the suburb. Prospect Nature Reserve is situated to the east of the suburb, which provides recreational needs.

<doc id="561867" wikidata="Q4951961" url="?curid=561867" title="Boxing in the 1930s">
<text>The sport of [[boxing]] in the 1930s was affected by one of the biggest economic struggles in the history of the United States: the depression era. Because of the suffering American economy, many boxers were offered lower amounts of money causing them to only box for passion. When the decade began, the world Heavyweight title belonged to no one. The sport of boxing suffered because of the lack of money to pay the boxers.

The Heavyweights, from 1930 to 1937 in particular, could be compared to the Heavyweight division of the 1980s. Six champions were crowned before Joe Louis began his legendary run as Heavyweight champion in 1937. He retired in 1949, still holding the title of world Heavyweight champion.
Boxing began expanding into Latin America in the 1930s: Sixto Escobar became the first world champion from Puerto Rico by defeating &quot;Baby Casanova&quot;. &quot;Baby Arizmendi&quot; conquered the first world title for Mexico in 1934. For his part, &quot;Kid Chocolate&quot; became the first world champion from Cuba.

Three world champions won world titles in three different divisions, a feat no single fighter had accomplished since 1903; Tony Canzoneri, Barney Ross and Henry Armstrong cemented their place in boxing history by achieving this feat. Armstrong was the first and only world champion to reign in three divisions at the same time; modern boxing rules ban boxers from holding the title in more than one division at a time.

<doc id="561869" wikidata="Q1972594" url="?curid=561869" title="Studentexamen">
<text>Studentexamen (Swedish for &quot;students&#x27; examination&quot; or &quot;students&#x27; degree&quot;), earlier also &quot;mogenhetsexamen&quot; (&quot;maturity examination&quot;) was the name of the university entrance examination in Sweden from the 17th century to 1968. From 1862 to 1968, it was taken as a final written and oral exam on graduation from gymnasium (secondary school). In Finland the examination (Finnish: &quot;Ylioppilastutkinto&quot;) still exists (Finland parted from Sweden 1809). 
The exam traces its origin to the academic statutes from 1655 requiring the dean to examine students arriving at university before allowing matriculation. According to the school reglement of 1693, a prospective student was to have gone through both a final examination at school and an entrance examination at university. The school reglement of 1724 allowed students without a final examination from school to enroll at university, provided a person known at the university would guarantee their behaviour, which led to it becoming common for students (called &quot;sponsionsstudenter&quot; or &quot;kautionsstudenter&quot;) from wealthy families to be matriculated at a very young age, accompanied by a private tutor. Although these were not actually supposed to be allowed to graduate, this rule was not always strictly upheld.

Attempts at a reform of the system led to the proposition in 1828 of the so-called Large Commission on Education, allowing students who had not completed a &quot;studentexamen&quot; to matriculate but disallowing them both from taking a degree or receiving any form of scholarship. The proposition also defined nine disciplines: Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Modern languages, Theology, Philosophy, Mathematics, History with Geography and Natural history, of which the prospective student had to have a grade of &quot;approbatur&quot; (Latin; in Swedish &quot;godkänd&quot;) in six and &quot;admittitur&quot; (a lower grade, in Swedish called &quot;försvarlig&quot;) in the three other to be allowed to enter university. These examinations were all oral, but a few years later, written examinations were introduced in Swedish and Latin.

In 1864, the &quot;studentexamen&quot; was moved from the universities to the secondary schools. It was thus changed from being primarily an entrance examination to academic studies to being a graduation diploma from the &quot;gymnasium&quot; or &quot;läroverk&quot;. In order to retain some academic control over the standard, a system was conceived where the Crown would appoint &quot;censors&quot; from the universities to take part in the examinations, and, if necessary, to fail a student passed by the teachers. The name of the examination was changed to &quot;mogenhetsprövning&quot; or &quot;mogenhetsexamen&quot; (&quot;maturity examination&quot;), and was known under this name until 1905, when the name &quot;studentexamen&quot; was restored.

With the new secondary school system (the &quot;gymnasieskola&quot; or &quot;gymnasium school&quot;) introduced in 1968, the final examination or &quot;studentexamen&quot; was abolished, but the word is in colloquial use for the completion of secondary school, known as &quot;gymnasieexamen&quot;, based on grades from cumulative courses.

<text>Earth pigments are naturally occurring minerals that have been used since prehistoric times as pigments. Among the primary types of earth pigments include the reddish-brown ochres, siennas, and umbers, which contain various amounts of iron oxides and manganese oxides. Other earth pigments include the green earth pigments or , blue earth pigments such as vivianite-based &quot;blue ochre&quot;, white earth pigments such as chalk, and black earth pigments such as charcoal.

Earth pigments are known for their fast drying time in oil painting, relative inexpensiveness, and lightfastness. Cave paintings done in sienna still survive today.

==Production==
After mining, the mineral used for making a pigment is ground to a very fine powder (if not already in the form of clay), washed to remove water-soluble components, dried, and ground again to powder. For some pigments, notably sienna and umber, the color can be deepened by heating (calcination) in a process known as &quot;burning&quot;, although it does not involve oxidation but instead dehydration.

<doc id="561874" wikidata="Q5600" url="?curid=561874" title="Mimar Sinan">
<text>Mimar Sinan (; , ; – 17 July 1588) also known as Koca Mi&#x27;mâr Sinân Âğâ, (&quot;Sinan Agha the Grand Architect&quot; or &quot;Grand Sinan&quot;) was the chief Ottoman architect, engineer and mathematician for sultans Suleiman the Magnificent, Selim II and Murad III. He was responsible for the construction of more than 300 major structures, including the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, the Kanuni Sultan Suleiman Bridge in Büyükçekmece, and the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge in Višegrad, as well as other more modest projects such as madrasa&#x27;s, külliyes, and bridges. His apprentices would later design the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul and the Stari Most bridge in Mostar.

The son of a stonemason, he received a technical education and became a military engineer. He rose rapidly through the ranks to become first an officer and finally a Janissary commander, with the honorific title of Sinan. He refined his architectural and engineering skills while on campaign with the Janissaries, becoming expert at constructing fortifications of all kinds, as well as military infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges and aqueducts. At about the age of fifty, he was appointed as chief royal architect, applying the technical skills he had acquired in the army to the &quot;creation of fine religious buildings&quot; and civic structures of all kinds. He remained in this post for almost fifty years.

His masterpiece is the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, although his most famous work is the Suleiman Mosque in Istanbul. He headed an extensive governmental department and trained many assistants who, in turn, distinguished themselves; these include Sedefkar Mehmed Agha, architect of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque and Mimar Hayruddin, architect of the Stari Most. He is considered the greatest architect of the classical period of Ottoman architecture and has been compared to Michelangelo, his contemporary in the West. Michelangelo and his plans for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome were well known in Istanbul, since Leonardo da Vinci and he had been invited, in 1502 and 1505 respectively, by the Sublime Porte to submit plans for a bridge spanning the Golden Horn. Mimar Sinan&#x27;s works are among the most influential buildings in history.

==Early years and background==
Mimar Sinan was born with the name Joseph in a small town called Ağırnas near the city of Kayseri in Anatolia (as stated in an order by Sultan Selim II).
His birth is variously placed either between 1489 and 1491 or between 1494 and 1499. His origin is disputed, mainly between Armenian, and Cappadocian Greek. One argument that lends credence to his Armenian or Greek background is a decree by Selim II dated Ramadan 7 981 (ca. December 30, 1573), which granted Sinan&#x27;s request to forgive and spare his relatives from the general exile of Kayseri&#x27;s Armenian community to the island of Cyprus; this decree was published in the June 1930-May 1931 edition of the Istanbul Turkish journal &quot;Türk Tarihi Encümeni Mecmuası&quot;. Godfrey Goodwin stated that &quot;after the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus in 1571, when Selim II decided to repopulate the island by transferring Rum (Orthodox Christian) families from the Karaman Eyalet, Sinan intervened on behalf of his family and obtained two orders from the Sultan in council exempting them from deportation.&quot; According to several scholars, this means that his family was Cappadocian Greek because the only Orthodox Christians (Rûms) of the region were Greek-speaking.

Sinan&#x27;s place of birth, Ağırnas, was a Greek village with no Armenian inhabitants, which some scholars argue would give more credence to the theory of him being of Greek origin. Additionally, before the Greeks evacuated the village, a Cappadocian Greek family from the village named Taşçıoğlu (Greek: Ταστσιόγλου) had claimed Sinan as a member of their own family.

Less popular theories among scholars are that Sinan was Albanian, or even Jewish, or Christian Turkish. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, Sinan had either Armenian or Greek origin. A local tradition in the village of Shiroka Lăka holds that Sinan was of Bulgarian origin and his family came from that village. Turkish scholars have meanwhile argued that Sinan&#x27;s family was Christian Turkish. In 1935, a council commissioned by the Turkish Historical Society went so far as to open up Sinan&#x27;s tomb and measure his skull so as demonstrate his Turkish &quot;racial&quot; heritage.

Sinan grew up helping his father in his work, and by the time that he was conscripted would have had a good grounding in the practicalities of building work. There are three brief records (Anonymous Text; Architectural Masterpieces; Book of Architecture) in the library of Topkapı Palace, dictated by Sinan to his friend and biographer Mustafa Sâi Çelebi. In these manuscripts, Sinan divulges some details of his youth and military career. His father is referred to as &quot;Abdülmennan&quot; (literally &quot;Servant of the Generous and Merciful One&quot;), a title which was commonly used in the Ottoman period to define the non-Muslim father of a Muslim convert.

==Military career==
In 1512, Sinan was conscripted into Ottoman service under the devshirme system. He was sent to Constantinople to be trained as an officer of the Janissary Corps and converted to Islam. He was too old to be admitted to the imperial Enderun School in the Topkapı Palace but was sent instead to an auxiliary school. Some records claim that he might have served the Grand Vizier Pargalı İbrahim Pasha as a novice of the Ibrahim Pasha School. Possibly, he was given the Islamic name &quot;Sinan&quot; there. He initially learned carpentry and mathematics but through his intellectual qualities and ambitions, he soon assisted the leading architects and got his training as an architect.

During the next six years, he also trained to be a Janissary officer (&quot;acemioğlan&quot;). He possibly joined Selim I in his last military campaign, Rhodes according to some sources, but when the Sultan died, this project ended. Two years later he witnessed the conquest of Belgrade. Under the new sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, he was present, as a member of the Household Cavalry, at the Battle of Mohács. He was promoted to captain of the Royal Guard and then given command of the Infantry Cadet Corps. He was later stationed in Austria, where he commanded the 62nd Orta of the Rifle Corps. He became a master of archery, while at the same time, as an architect, learning the weak points of structures when gunning them down. In 1535 he participated in the Baghdad campaign as a commanding officer of the Royal Guard. In 1537 he went on expeditions to Corfu and Apulia and Moldavia.

During these campaigns he proved himself an able architect and engineer. When the Ottoman army captured Cairo, Sinan was promoted to chief architect and was given the privilege of tearing down any buildings in the captured city that were not according to the city plan. During the campaign in the East, he assisted in the building of defences and bridges, such as a bridge across the Danube. He converted churches into mosques. During the Persian campaign in 1535 he built ships for the army and the artillery to cross Lake Van. For this he was given the title &quot;Haseki&#x27;i&quot;, Sergeant-at-Arms in the body guard of the Sultan, a rank equivalent to that of the Janissary Ağa.

When Chelebi Lütfi Pasha became Grand Vizier in 1539, he appointed Sinan, who had previously served under his command, to the office of Architect of the Abode of Felicity. This was the start of a remarkable career. The job entailed the supervision infrastructure construction and the flow of supplies within the Ottoman Empire. He was also responsible for the design and construction of public works, such as roads, waterworks and bridges. Through the years he transformed his office into that of Architect of the Empire, an elaborate government department, with greater powers than his supervising minister. He became the head of a whole Corps of architects, training a team of assistants, deputies and pupils.

==Work==

His training as an army engineer gave Sinan an empirical approach to architecture rather than a theoretical one. But the same can be said of the great Western Renaissance architects, such as Brunelleschi and Michelangelo.

Various sources state that Sinan was the architect of at least 374 structures which included 92 mosques; 52 small mosques (&quot;mescit&quot;); 55 schools of theology (&quot;medrese&quot;); 7 schools for Koran reciters (&quot;darülkurra&quot;); 20 mausoleums (&quot;türbe&quot;); 17 public kitchens (&quot;imaret&quot;); 3 hospitals (&quot;darüşşifa&quot;); 6 aqueducts; 10 bridges; 20 caravanserais; 36 palaces and mansions; 8 vaults; and 48 baths. Sinan held the position of chief architect of the palace, which meant being the overseer of all construction work of the Ottoman Empire, for nearly 50 years, working with a large team of assistants consisting of architects and master builders.

The development and maturing stages of Sinan&#x27;s career can be illustrated by three major works. The first two of these are in Istanbul: the Şehzade Mosque, which he calls a work of his apprenticeship period and the Süleymaniye Mosque, which is the work of his qualification stage. The Selimiye Mosque in Edirne is the product of his master stage.

Şehzade Mosque is the first of the grand mosques created by Sinan. The Mihrimah Sultan Mosque, which is also known as the Üsküdar Quay Mosque, was completed in the same year and has an original design with its main dome supported by three half domes. When Sinan reached the age of 70, he had completed the Süleymaniye Mosque complex. This building, situated on one of the hills of Istanbul facing the Golden Horn, and built in the name of Süleyman the Magnificent, is one of the symbolic monuments of the period. The diameter of the dome, which exceeds the of the Selimiye Mosque which Sinan completed when he was 80, is the most outstanding example of the level of achievement reached by Sinan. Mimar Sinan reached his artistic peak with the design, architecture, tile decorations and land stone workmanship displayed at Selimiye.

Another area of architecture where Sinan produced unique designs are his mausoleums. The Mausoleum of Şehzade Mehmed is notable for with its exterior decorations and sliced dome. The Rüstem Paşa mausoleum is a very attractive structure in classical style. The mausoleum of Süleyman the Magnificent is an interesting experiment, with an octagonal body and flat dome. The Selim II Mausoleum with has a square plan and is one of the best examples of Turkish mausoleum architecture. Sinan&#x27;s own mausoleum, which is located in the north-east part of the Süleymaniye complex on the other hand, is a very plain structure.

Sinan masterfully combined art with functionalism in the bridges he built. The largest of these is the nearly long Büyükçekmece Bridge. Other important examples are the Ailivri Bridge, the Old Bridge in Svilengrad on the Maritsa, the Lüleburgaz (Sokullu Mehmet Pasha) Bridge on the Lüleburgaz River, the Sinanlı Bridge over the river Ergene and the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge over Drina river in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

While Sinan was maintaining and improving the water supply system of Istanbul, he built arched aqueducts at several locations within the city. The Mağlova Arch over the Alibey River, which is long and high, has two tiers of arches, and is one of the best examples of its kind.

At the start of Sinan&#x27;s career, Ottoman architecture was highly pragmatic. Buildings were repetitions of former types and were based on rudimentary plans. They were more an assembly of parts than a conception of a whole. An architect could sketch a plan for a new building and an assistant or foreman knew what to do, because novel ideas were avoided. Moreover, architects used an extravagant margin of safety in their designs, resulting in a wasteful use of material and labour. Sinan would gradually change all this. He was to transform established architectural practices, amplifying and transforming the traditions by adding innovations, trying to approach perfection.

=== The early years (till the mid-1550s): apprenticeship period ===
During these years he continued the traditional pattern of Ottoman architecture, but he gradually began exploring other possibilities, because during his military career he had had the opportunity to study the architectural monuments in the conquered cities of Europe and the Middle East.

His first opportunity to design a major building was the Hüsrev Pasha Mosque and its double medresse in Aleppo, Syria. It was built in the winter of 1536-1537 for his commander-in-chief and the governor of Aleppo between two army campaigns. It was built hastily and this is evident in the coarseness of execution and the crude decoration.

His first major commission as the royal architect was the construction of the Haseki Sultan Complex for Hurrem Sultan, the wife of the sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent. He had to follow the plans drawn by his predecessors. Sinan retained the traditional arrangement of the available space without any innovations. Nevertheless, it was already better built than the Aleppo mosque and it shows a certain elegance. However, it has suffered from many restorations. Sinan is credited to have built a defensive tower in Vlorë, south Albania, in 1537, very similar to the White Tower of Thessaloniki, as well as Muradie Mosque, during Suleiman the Magnificent&#x27;s stay in the town for the preparation of his expedition towards Italy.

In 1541, he started the construction of the mausoleum (&quot;türbe&quot;) of the Grand Admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa. It stands on the shore of Beşiktaş on the European part of Istanbul, at the site where his fleet used to assemble. Oddly enough, the admiral is not buried there, but in his türbe next to the Iskele mosque. This mausoleum has been severely neglected since then.

Mihrimah Sultan, the only daughter of Suleiman and Hurrem and wife of the Grand Vizier Rüstem Pasha gave Sinan the commission to build a mosque with &quot;medrese&quot; (college), an &quot;imaret&quot; (soup kitchen) and a (Qur&#x27;an school) in Üsküdar. The &quot;imaret&quot; no longer exists. This Iskele Mosque (or Jetty mosque) already shows several hallmarks of Sinan&#x27;s mature style: a spacious, high-vaulted basement, slender minarets, single-domed baldacchino, flanked by three semi-domes ending in three exedrae and a broad double portico. The construction was finished in 1548. The construction of a double portico was not a first in Ottoman architecture, but it set a trend for country mosques and mosques of viziers in particular. Rüstem Pasha and Mihrimah required them later in their three mosques in Constantinople and in the Rüstem Pasha Mosque in Tekirdağ. The inner portico traditionally have stalactite capitals while the outer portico has capitals with chevron patterns (&quot;baklava&quot;).

When sultan Suleiman the Magnificent returned from another Balkan campaign, he received news that his son Şehzade Mehmed had died at the age of twenty-two. In November 1543, not long after Sinan had started the construction of the Iskele Mosque, the sultan ordered Sinan to build a new major mosque with an adjoining complex in memory of his favourite son. This Şehzade Mosque would become larger and more ambitious than his previous ones. Architectural historians consider this mosque as Sinan&#x27;s first masterpiece. Obsessed by the concept of a large central dome, Sinan turned to the plans of mosques such as the Fatih Pasha Mosque in Diyarbakır or the Piri Pasha Mosque in Hasköy. He must have visited both mosques during his Persian campaign. Sinan built a mosque with a central dome, this time with four equal half-domes. This superstructure is supported by four massive, but still elegant, free-standing octagonal fluted piers and four piers incorporated in each lateral wall. In the corners, above roof level, four turrets serve as stabilizing anchors. This coherent concept already is markedly different from the additive plans of traditional Ottoman architecture. Sedefkar Mehmed Agha would later copy the concept of fluted piers in his Sultan Ahmed Mosque in an attempt to lighten their appearance. Sinan, however, rejected this solution in his next mosques.

=== Mid-1550s to 1570: qualification stage ===

By 1550, Suleiman the Magnificent was at the height of his powers. Having built a mosque for his son, he felt it was time to construct his own imperial mosque, an enduring monument larger than all the others, to be built on a gently sloping hillside dominating the Golden Horn. Money was no problem, since he had accumulated a treasure from the loot of his campaigns in Europe and the Middle East. He gave the order to Sinan to build a mosque, the Süleymaniye, surrounded by a külliye consisting of four colleges, a soup kitchen, a hospital, an asylum, a hamam, a caravanserai and a hospice for travellers (&quot;tabhane&quot;). Sinan, now heading a formidable department with a great number of assistants, finished this formidable task in seven years. Before Süleymaniye, no mosques had been built with half cubic roofs. He got the idea of half cubic roof design from the Hagia Sophia. Through this monumental achievement, Sinan emerged from the anonymity of his predecessors. Sinan must have known the ideas of the Renaissance architect Leone Battista Alberti (who in turn had studied &quot;De architectura&quot; by the Roman architect and engineer Vitruvius), since he too was concerned in building the ideal church, reflecting harmony through the perfection of geometry in architecture. But, contrary to his Western counterparts, Sinan was more interested in simplification than in enrichment. He tried to achieve the largest volume under a single central dome. The dome is based on the circle, the perfect geometrical figure representing, in an abstract way, a perfect God. Sinan used subtle geometric relationships, using multiples of two when calculating the ratios and the proportions of his buildings. However, in a later stage, he also used divisions of three or ratios of two to three when working out the width and the proportions of domes, such as the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque at Kadırga.

While he was fully occupied with the construction of the Süleymaniye, Sinan or his subordinates drew up the plans and gave instructions for many other constructions. Sinan built a mosque for the Grand Vizier Pargalı İbrahim Pasha and a mausoleum (&quot;türbe&quot;) at Silivrikapı (Constantinople) in 1551.
The next Grand Vizier, Rüstem Pasha gave Sinan several more commissions. In 1550 he built a large inn (&quot;han&quot;) in the Galata district of Istanbul. About ten years later he built another &quot;han&quot; in Edirne, and between 1544 and 1561 the Taṣ Han at Erzurum. He designed a caravanserai in Eregli and an octagonal madrasah in Constantinople.

Between 1553 and 1555, Sinan built the Sinan Pasha Mosque at Beşiktaş, a smaller version of the Üç Şerefeli Mosque at Edirne, for the Grand Admiral Sinan Pasha. This proves again that Sinan had thoroughly studied the work of other architects, especially since he was responsible for the upkeep of these buildings. He copied the old form, pondered over the weaknesses in the construction and tried to solve this with his own solution. In 1554, Sinan used the form of the Sinan Pasha mosque again for the construction of the mosque for the next Grand Vizier Kara Ahmet Pasha in Constantinople, his first hexagonal mosque. By using a hexagonal plan, Sinan could reduce the side domes to half-domes and set them in the corners at an angle of 45 degrees. Clearly, Sinan must have appreciated this form, since he repeated it later in mosques such as the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque at Kadırga and the Atik Valide Mosque at Üsküdar.

In 1556, Sinan built the Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamamı, replacing the antique Baths of Zeuxippus, which are still standing close to the Hagia Sophia. This would become one of the most beautiful hamams he ever constructed.

In 1559, he built the Cafer Ağa madrasah below the forecourt of the Hagia Sophia. In the same year he began the construction of a small mosque for Iskender Pasha at Kanlıca, beside the Bosphorus. This was one of the many minor and routine commissions the office of Sinan received over the years.

In 1561, when Rüstem Pasha died, Sinan began the construction of the Rüstem Pasha Mosque, as a memorial supervised by his widow Mihrimah Sultan. It is situated just below the Süleymaniye. This time the central form is octagonal, modelled on the monastery church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, with four small semi-domes set in the corners. In the same year, Sinan built a türbe for Rüstem Pasha in the garden of the Şehzade Mosque, decorated with the finest tiles Iznik could produce. Mihrimah Sultan, having doubled her wealth after the death of her husband, now wanted a mosque of her own. Sinan built the Mihrimah Mosque at Edirnekapı (Edirne Gate) for her on the highest of the seven hills of Constantinople. He raised the mosque on a vaulted platform, accentuating its hilltop site. There is some speculation concerning the dates; until recently this was supposed to be between 1540 and 1540, but now it is generally accepted to be between 1562 and 1565. Sinan, concerned with grandeur, built a mosque in one of his most imaginative designs, using new support systems and lateral spaces to increase the area available for windows. He built a central dome high and wide, supported by pendentives, on a square base with two lateral galleries, each with three cupolas. At each corner of this square stands a gigantic pier, connected with immense arches each with 15 large windows and four circular ones, flooding the interior with light. The style of this revolutionary building was as close to the Gothic style as Ottoman structure permits.

In 1566 Sinan completed the Banya Bashi Mosque in Sofia, Bulgaria, currently the only functioning mosque in the city. His first mosque in Sofia was built in 1528; popularly known as &quot;Imaret Mosque&quot; or &quot;Black Mosque&quot; due to the dark colour of its building stone, it was damaged by an earthquake and abandoned in the 19th century.

In the 1560s he built the Kirkcesme water supply system for Istanbul. It is seen as a masterpiece of his work. It spans 55 km and includes 35 aqueduct bridges, 4 of which are notable for their height (up to 35m) as well as their length (up to 700m).

Between 1560 and 1566 Sinan built a mosque in Constantinople for Zal Mahmud Pasha on a hillside beyond Ayvansaray. Sinan certainly conceived the plans and partly supervised the construction, but left the building of lesser areas to less than competent hands, since Sinan and his most able assistants were about to begin his masterpiece, the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. On the outside, the mosque rises high, with its east wall pierced by four tiers of windows. This gives the mosque an aspect of a palace or even a block of apartments. Inside, there are three broad galleries making the interior look compact. The heaviness of this structure makes the dome look unexpectedly lofty. These galleries look like a preliminary try-out for the galleries of the Selimiye Mosque.

=== The period from 1570 to his death: master stage ===
In this late stage of his life, Sinan tried to create unified and sublimely elegant interiors. To achieve this, he eliminated all the unnecessary subsidiary spaces beyond the supporting piers of the central dome. This can be seen in the Sokollu Mehmed Pasha Mosque in Kadırga, Istanbul (1571–1572) and in the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. In other buildings of his final period, Sinan experimented with spatial and mural treatments that were new in the classical Ottoman architecture.

According to him from his autobiography &quot;Tezkiretü&#x27;l-Bünyan&quot;, his masterpiece is the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. Breaking free of the handicaps of traditional Ottoman architecture, this mosque marks the climax of Sinan&#x27;s work and of all classical Ottoman architecture. While it was being built, the architect&#x27;s saying of &quot;You can never build a dome larger than the dome of Hagia Sophia and specially as Muslims&quot; was his main motivation. When it was completed, Sinan claimed that it had the largest dome in the world, leaving Hagia Sophia behind. In fact, the dome height from the ground level was lower and the diameter barely larger (0.5 meters, approximately 2 feet) than the millennium-older Hagia Sophia. However, measured from its base the dome of Selimiye is higher. Sinan was more than 80 years old when the building was finished. In this mosque he finally realized his aim of creating the optimum, completely unified, domed interior: a triumph of space that dominates the interior. He used this time an octagonal central dome (31.28 m wide and 42 m high), supported by eight elephantine piers of marble and granite. These supports lack any capitals but have squinches or consoles at their summit, leading to the optical effect that the arches seem to grow integrally out of the piers. By placing the lateral galleries far away, he increased the three-dimensional effect. The many windows in the screen walls flood the interior with light. The buttressing semi-domes are set in the four corners of the square under the dome. The weight and the internal tensions are hidden, producing an airy and elegant effect rarely seen under a central dome. The four minarets (83 m high) at the corners of the prayer hall are the tallest in the Muslim world, accentuating the vertical posture of this mosque that already dominates the city.
He also designed the Sulaymaniyya Takiyya in Damascus, Syria, considered to have marked the introduction of the Ottoman architectural style to the city. He has also built Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge across the Drina River in Višegrad, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

=== Conclusion ===
At the start of his career as an architect, Sinan had to deal with an established, traditional domed architecture. His training as an army engineer led him to approach architecture from an empirical point of view, rather than from a theoretical one. He started to experiment with the design and engineering of single-domed and multiple-domed structures. He tried to obtain a new geometrical purity, a rationality and a spatial integrity in his structures and designs of mosques. Through all this, he demonstrated his creativity and his wish to create a clear, unified space. He started to develop a series of variations on the domes, surrounding them in different ways with semi-domes, piers, screen walls and different sets of galleries. His domes and arches are curved, but he avoided curvilinear elements in the rest of his design, transforming the circle of the dome into a rectangular, hexagonal or octagonal system. He tried to obtain a rational harmony between the exterior pyramidal composition of semi-domes, culminating in a single drumless dome, and the interior space where this central dome vertically integrates the space into a unified whole. His genius lies in the organization of this space and in the resolution of the tensions created by the design. He was an innovator in the use of decoration and motifs, merging them into the architectural forms as a whole. He accentuated the centre underneath the central dome by flooding it with light from the many windows. He incorporated his mosques in an efficient way into a complex (&quot;külliye&quot;), serving the needs of the community as an intellectual centre, a community centre and serving the social needs and the health problems of the faithful.

When Sinan died, classical Ottoman architecture had reached its climax. No successor was gifted enough to better the design of the Selimiye Mosque and to develop it further. His students retreated to earlier models, such as the Şehzade mosque. Invention faded away, and a decline set in.

==Constructions==

According to the official list of his works, the &quot;Tezkiretü&#x27;l Ebniye&quot;, during his 50 year tenure of the post of imperial architect Sinan constructed or supervised 476 buildings, 196 of which survive. He could not possibly have designed them all, but relied on the skills of his office. He took credit and the responsibility for their work. As a janissary, and thus a slave of the sultan, his primary responsibility was to the sultan. In his spare time, he also designed buildings for the chief officials. He delegated to his assistants the construction of less important buildings in the provinces.

== Death and legacy ==
Sinan died in AH 996 (1587–88 CE) and is buried in a tomb in Istanbul, a &quot;türbe&quot; of his own design, just to the north of the Süleymaniye Mosque, across a street named Mimar Sinan Caddesi in his honour. He was buried near the tombs of his greatest patrons: Sultan Süleyman I and Sultana Haseki Hürrem, Suleiman&#x27;s wife. Above the iron-grilled prayer window of his tomb is an epitaph written in Ottoman Turkish by the poet Mustafa Sai. It gives the year of his death and records that Sinan built 400 masjids (small mosques), 80 Friday mosques and the Kanuni Sultan Suleiman bridge at Büyükçekmece. In the position of chief imperial architect he was succeeded by Davud Agha, one of the architects who had worked under him.

In 1935, his remains were exhumed by a group of Turkish scholars. Proponents of the racial science popular at the time, they claimed that measurements of Sinan&#x27;s skull proved that he was actually Turkish. As of 2016, the skull is missing.

His name is also given to:
* a crater on the planet Mercury.
* A Turkish state university, the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University and the Mimar Sinan Mosque, both in Istanbul.

Sinan&#x27;s portrait was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 10,000 lira banknotes of 1982–1995
and a 7 500 000 lira coin of 2001 (in the &quot;millennium&quot; series), also on 6 postage stamps: 100 lira 1957 (400th anniversary of the opening of the Suleymaniye Mosque), 50 lira 1988 (400th anniversary of Sinan&#x27;s death) and a set of 4 issued on 14 November 2007 (60, 70, 70 &amp; 80 Kurus - Sinan and his works).

Sinan is portrayed in Elif Shafak&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, with the fictional main character becoming his apprentice.

<doc id="561875" wikidata="Q918132" url="?curid=561875" title="Invasion of Java (1811)">
<text>The invasion of Java was a successful British amphibious operation against Java in the Dutch East Indies between August and September 1811 during the Napoleonic Wars. Originally established as a colony of the Dutch East India Company, Java remained in Dutch hands throughout the French Revolutionary Wars, during which the French invaded the Dutch Republic, transforming it into the Batavian Republic in 1795 and the Kingdom of Holland in 1806. The Kingdom of Holland was annexed to the First French Empire in 1810, and Java became a French colony, though it continued to be administered and garrisoned primarily with Dutch personnel.

After their capture of the French West Indies between 1809 and 1810, and a successful campaign against France&#x27;s possessions in Mauritius from 1810 to 1811, British attention turned to the Dutch East Indies. An expedition was dispatched from British India in April 1811, while a small squadron of Royal Navy frigates was ordered to patrol off the island, raiding shipping and launching amphibious assaults against targets of opportunity. British troops landed on 4 August, and by 8 August the undefended city of Batavia capitulated. The defenders withdrew to a previously prepared fortified position, Fort Cornelis, which the British besieged, capturing it early in the morning of 26 August. The remaining defenders, a mixture of Dutch and French regulars and native militiamen, withdrew, pursued by the British. A series of amphibious and land assaults captured most of the remaining strongholds, and the city of Salatiga surrendered on 16 September, followed by the official capitulation of the island to the British on 18 September.

The island remained in British hands for the remainder of the Napoleonic Wars, but was returned to Dutch control in 1816, as per the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.

==Background==
The Dutch had been under French control for several years and were already at war with Britain. The strongly pro-French Herman Willem Daendels was appointed governor-general of the Dutch East Indies in 1807. He arrived in Java aboard the French privateer &quot;Virginie&quot; in 1808, and began fortifying the island against the British threat. In particular, Daendels established an entrenched camp named Fort Cornelis a few miles south of Batavia. He also improved the island&#x27;s defences by building new hospitals, barracks, arms factories and a new military college.

In 1810, the Kingdom of Holland were formally annexed by France. As part of the resulting changes, Jan Willem Janssens was appointed personally by Napoleon Bonaparte to replace Daendels as governor-general. Janssens had previously served as governor of the Dutch Cape Colony, and had been forced to capitulate after being defeated by British forces at the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806. Janssens accompanied a French frigate division under Joseph-François Raoul, which consisted of the frigates &quot;Méduse&quot; and &quot;Nymphe&quot; and the corvette &quot;Sappho&quot;, tasked with supporting Java. The division was accompanied by several hundred light infantrymen and several senior French officers. They arrived in Java in April 1811 without mishap. On 2 September, the frigates arrived at Surabaya, tailed by the 32-gun frigate HMS &quot;Bucephalus&quot;. Two days later, the British sloop HMS &quot;Barracouta&quot; joined the chase, but lost contact on 8 September. Four days later, &quot;Méduse&quot; and &quot;Nymphe&quot; chased &quot;Bucephalus&quot;, which escaped and broke contact the next day. The squadron was back in Brest, France on 22 December 1811.

British forces had already occupied the Dutch colonies of Ambon and the Molucca Islands; they had also recently captured the French colonies of Réunion and Isle de France in the Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811. Stamford Raffles, an East India Company official who had been forced to leave the Dutch colony at Malacca when Holland was annexed, suggested to Lord Minto, the Governor-General of India, that Java and the other Dutch possessions should be captured. With the large forces which had been made available to him for the Mauritius campaign, Minto enthusiastically adopted the suggestion, and even proposed to accompany the expedition himself.

===Naval raids===
The Navy was active off the Javanese coastline before and during the expedition. On 23 May 1811 a party from attacked a flotilla of fourteen Dutch gun vessels off Surabaya, capturing nine of them. Merak, in north-western Java, was attacked and the fort defending the town largely demolished by a party from and HMS &quot;Leda&quot; on 30 July. On the same day attacked a squadron of six Dutch gunboats flying French colours, capturing five and destroying the sixth.

==Invasion==
The British force, initially under the command of Vice-Admiral William O&#x27;Bryen Drury, and then after his death in March 1811, under Commodore William Robert Broughton, assembled at bases in India in early 1811. The first division of troops, under the command of Colonel Rollo Gillespie, left Madras on 18 April, escorted by a squadron under Captain Christopher Cole aboard the 36-gun . They arrived at Penang on 18 May, and on 21 May the second division, led by Major-General Frederick Augustus Wetherall, which had left Calcutta on 21 April, escorted by a squadron under Captain Fleetwood Pellew, aboard the 38-gun joined them. The two squadrons sailed together, arriving at Malacca on 1 June, where they made contact with a division of troops from Bengal under Lieutenant-General Sir Samuel Auchmuty, escorted by Commodore Broughton aboard the 74-gun . Auchmuty and Broughton became the military and naval commanders in chief respectively of the expedition. 

With the force now assembled Auchmuty had roughly 11,960 men under his command, the previous strength having been reduced by approximately 1,200 by sickness. Those too ill to travel on were landed at Malacca, and on 11 June the fleet sailed onwards. After calling at various points en route, the force arrived off Indramayu on 30 June. On 31 July Captain Maunsell commanding the sloop the &quot;Procris&quot;, discovered a convoy of 40 or 50 proas, escorted by six French gunboats in the mouth of the Indromayo river. Launching boats they were able to board and capture five of the French gunboats in quick succession; the sixth blew up. Meanwhile, however, the convoy escaped up the shallow muddy river.

There the fleet waited for a time for intelligence concerning the Dutch strength. Colonel Mackenzie, an officer who had been dispatched to reconnoitre the coast, suggested a landing site at Cilincing, an undefended fishing village east of Batavia. The fleet anchored off the Marandi River on 4 August, and began landing troops at 14:00. The defenders were taken by surprise, and nearly six hours passed before Franco-Dutch troops arrived to oppose the landing, by which time 8,000 British troops had been landed. A brief skirmish took place between the advance guards, and the Franco-Dutch forces were repulsed.

===Fall of Batavia===

On learning of the successful British landing, Janssens withdrew from Batavia with his army, which amounted to between 8,000 and 10,090 men, and garrisoned themselves in Fort Cornelis. The British advanced on Batavia, reaching it on 8 August and finding it undefended. The city surrendered to the forces under Colonel Gillespie, after Broughton and Auchmuty had offered promises to respect private property. The British were disappointed to find that part of the town had been set on fire, and many warehouses full of goods such as coffee and sugar had been looted or flooded, depriving them of prize money. On 9 August 1811 Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford arrived and superseded Commodore Broughton, who was judged to be too cautious. Stopford had orders to supersede Rear-Admiral Albemarle Bertie as commander in chief at the Cape, but on his arrival he learnt of Vice-Admiral Drury&#x27;s death, and the planned expedition to Java, and so travelled on.

===British advances===
General Janssens had always intended to rely on the tropical climate and disease to weaken the British army rather than oppose a landing. The British now advanced on Janssens&#x27;s stronghold, reducing enemy positions as they went. The Dutch military and naval station at Weltevreeden fell to the British after an attack on 10 August. British losses did not exceed 100 while the defenders lost over 300. In one skirmish, one of Janssens&#x27;s French subordinates, General Alberti, was killed when he mistook some British riflemen in their green uniforms for Dutch troops. Weltevreeden was six miles from Fort Cornelis and on 20 August the British began preparing fortifications of their own, some 600 yards from the Franco-Dutch positions.

===Siege of Fort Cornelis===

Fort Cornelis measured in length by between and in breadth. Two hundred and eighty cannon were mounted on its walls and bastions. Its defenders were a mixed bag of Dutch, French and East Indies troops. Most of the locally raised East Indian troops were of doubtful loyalty and effectiveness, although there were some determined artillerymen from Celebes. The captured station at Weltevreeden proved an ideal base from which the British could lay siege to Fort Cornelis. On 14 August the British completed a trail through the forests and pepper plantations to allow them to bring up heavy guns and munitions, and opened siege works on the north side of the Fort. For several days, there were exchanges of fire between the fort and the British batteries, manned mainly by Royal Marines and sailors from HMS &quot;Nisus&quot;.

A sortie from the fort early on the morning of 22 August briefly seized three of the British batteries, until they were driven back by some of the Bengal Sepoys and the 69th Foot. The two sides then exchanged heavy fire, faltering on 23 August, but resuming on 24 August. The Franco-Dutch position worsened when a deserter helped General Rollo Gillespie to capture two of the redoubts by surprise. Gillespie, who was suffering from fever, collapsed, but recovered to storm a third redoubt. The French General Jauffret was taken prisoner. Two Dutch officers, Major Holsman and Major Muller, sacrificed themselves to blow up the redoubt&#x27;s magazine.

The three redoubts were nevertheless the key to the defence, and their loss demoralised most of Janssens&#x27;s East Indian troops. Many Dutch troops also defected, repudiating their allegiance to the French. The British stormed the fort at midnight on 25 August, capturing it after a bitter fight. The siege cost the British 630 casualties. The defenders&#x27; casualties were heavier, but only those among officers were fully recorded. Forty of them were killed, sixty-three wounded and 230 captured, including two French generals. Nearly 5,000 men were captured, including three general officers, 34 field officers, 70 captains and 150 subaltern officers. 1,000 men were found dead in the fort, with more being killed in the subsequent pursuit. Janssens escaped to Buitenzorg with a few survivors from his army, but was forced to abandon the town when the British approached.

Total British losses in the campaign after the fall of Fort Cornelis amounted to 141 killed, 733 wounded and 13 missing from the Army, and 15 killed, 45 wounded and three missing from the Navy; a total of 156 killed, 788 wounded and 16 missing by 27 August.

===Later actions===
Royal Navy ships continued to patrol off the coast, occasionally making raids on targets of opportunity. On 4 September two French 40-gun frigates, the &quot;Méduse&quot; and the &quot;Nymphe&quot; attempted to escape from Surabaya. They were pursued by the 36-gun and the 18-gun HMS &quot;Barracouta&quot;, until &quot;Barracouta&quot; lost contact. &quot;Bucephalus&quot; pursued them alone until 12 September, when the French frigates came about and attempted to overhaul her. &quot;Bucephalus&quot;″s commander, Captain Charles Pelly, turned about and tried to lead the pursuing French over shoals, but seeing the danger, they hauled off and abandoned the chase, returning to Europe.

On 31 August a force from the frigates , and , and the sloop HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; captured the fort and town of Sumenep, on Madura Island in the face of a large Dutch defending force. The rest of Madura and several surrounding islands placed themselves under the British soon afterwards. Suspecting Janssens to be in Cirebon, a force was landed there from , , HMS &quot;President&quot;, and on 4 September, causing the defenders to promptly surrender. General Jamelle, a member of Janssens&#x27;s staff, was captured in the fall of the town. The town and fort of Taggal surrendered on 12 September after and arrived offshore.

While the navy took control of coastal towns, the army pushed on into the interior of the island. Janssens had been reinforced on 3 September by 1,200 mounted irregulars under Prince Prang Wedono and other Javanese militia. On 16 September Salatiga fell to the British. Janssens attacked a British force under Colonel Samuel Gibbs that day, but was repulsed. Many of the native militia killed their Dutch officers in the ensuing rout. With his effective force reduced to a handful of men, Janssens surrendered two days later, on 18 September.

==Aftermath==
The Dutch-held islands of Amboyna, Harouka, Saparua, Nasso-Laut, Buru, Manipa, Manado, Copang, Amenang, Kemar, Twangwoo, and Ternate had surrendered to a force led by Captain Edward Tucker in 1810, while Captain Christopher Cole captured the Banda Islands, completing the conquest of Dutch possessions in the Maluku Islands. Java became the last major colonial possession in the East not under British control, and its fall marked the effective end of the war in these waters. Stamford Raffles was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Java. He ended Dutch administrative methods, liberalized the system of land tenure, and extended trade.

Britain returned Java and other East Indian possessions to the newly independent United Kingdom of the Netherlands under the terms of the Convention of London in 1814. One enduring legacy of the British occupation was the road rules, as the British had decreed that traffic should drive on the left, and this has endured in Indonesia to this day.

==Sepoy revolt==
The Bengali sepoy regiments stationed in Yogyakarta in 1815, inspired by the Hindu rituals of the Surakarta court and the glory of the Javanese temples of Prambanan and Borobodur planned a revolt against the British. This plot was conjured with the help of Sunan and the sepoys planned to kill all the British officers, overthrow European power, and install a Bengali administration over the whole island. In the end, the plan never came to fruition. As described by British officer Sir Stamford Raffles:

He further stated that this revolt would ultimately have led to the reestablishment of Hinduism in Java and the expulsion of European power

The Sunan of Surakarta took an avid interest in the Hindu sepoys, and would attend Pooja with the Bengalis, who prayed to Javanese idols which likely had not seen worship in centuries. He would also allow them to take part in his court, and use his facilities for worship and training.

==British order of battle==
Stopford&#x27;s fleet on his arrival on 9 August to assume command of the expedition, consisted of the following ships, dispersed around the Javanese coast:

<text>The Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts, founded in 1915 by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn in Los Angeles, California, helped many perfect their dancing talents and became the first dance academy in the United States to produce a professional dance company. Some of the school&#x27;s more notable pupils include Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Lillian Powell, Charles Weidman, Jack Cole, and silent film star Louise Brooks. The school was especially renowned for its influence on ballet and experimental modern dance. In time, Denishawn teachings reached another school location as well - Studio 61 at the Carnegie Hall Studios.

==Beginnings==
Initially solo artists, Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn began collaborating on work in 1914. St. Denis was preparing for a tour of the southeastern region of the United States, and needed a male partner to help present new ballroom dances. Shawn, who had admired St. Denis since seeing her perform in 1911, auditioned for and was awarded the role. The resulting tour featured the partnered pieces along with individual works from St. Denis and Shawn respectively.

The working relationship between Shawn and St. Denis soon turned romantic. The two artists fell in love and were married on August 13, 1914. Denis, reticent about marriage, had the word &quot;obey&quot; deleted from their wedding vows and declined to wear a wedding ring. Their &quot;honeymoon&quot; consisted of a second joint tour - accompanied by a small company of dancers - from Saratoga Springs, New York to San Francisco, California. A new collection of dances, including more ballroom variations, St. Denis&#x27; solos and Shawn&#x27;s famous &quot;Dagger Dance&quot;, was showcased. For promotional purposes, the dancing group was referred to as the St. Denis-Shawn Company. During the summer of 1915 in Los Angeles, the two established their first official school, the Ruth St. Denis School of Dancing and Its Related Arts at 600 St. Paul Avenue.

On February 6, 1915, on yet another tour, the term &quot;Denishawn&quot; surfaced. At a performance in Portland, Oregon, a theater manager promised eight box seats to whoever could dream up the most creative name for the latest St. Denis-Shawn ballroom exhibition. The unchallenged, winning title was &quot;The Denishawn Rose Mazurka.&quot; While the full name did not warrant much popularity, the &quot;Denishawn&quot; portion attracted audience members and the press - to such an extent that the namesake couple officially changed their company name from the St. Denis-Shawn Company to Denishawn Dancers.

With the new name and their own school, Shawn and St. Denis began brainstorming ways to expand their contributions to the dance world. St. Denis and Shawn renamed the school &#x27;The Denishawn School&#x27;, and they soon began developing those movements, techniques, and innovations that became known as the Denishawn style of dancing. The two developed a guide for their pedagogy and choreography, an excerpt of which is:&quot;&quot;

==Later years==
Denishawn disintegrated in 1931 after Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis separated, though the pair never divorced and continued to promote dance education through their respective endeavors. Shawn went on to purchase the property used for the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance center in Becket, Massachusetts, which continues to operate. In her teachings after Denishawn, St. Denis focused on spiritual and Asian influences in dance. After roughly a decade working apart, Shawn and St. Denis reunited briefly in 1941 at the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance festival, where they performed several works together.

==Technique and classes==
Over the years that the school grew more widely renown, the teaching system was constantly being evolved. According to St. Denis, Shawn contributed the most to this. He addressed incoming students with a &#x27;diagnosis lesson&#x27;, which would assess their current skills in order to assign them to a specific learning/class structure for their time at the Denishawn school. Shawn also was firm on his ideas of what was necessary for the learning curriculum. He believed that ballet was an overall necessity for any dancer to move forward or thrive in their studies, which is a big reason why the Denishawn curriculum was largely based on ballet fundamentals.

When taking technique classes, students danced in bare feet and wore identical one-piece black wool bathing suits. Classes lasted three hours every morning. Shawn typically taught during the first block of time, leading students through stretches, limbering exercises, ballet barre and floor progressions and free-form center combinations. St. Denis then took over with instruction in Oriental and yoga techniques. Author and former Denishawn pupil Jane Sherman recalls an everyday class, laden with ballet terminology:&quot;&quot;Each pupil danced alone a series of pas de basques: the Denishawn version, the ballet, the Spanish, and the Hungarian. The Denishawn pas de basque was distinguished by arms held high and parallel overhead as the body made an extreme arch sideways toward the leading foot.

Next usually came a free, open exercise affectionately nicknamed &quot;arms and body,&quot; done to a waltz from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. A forerunner of the technical warmups now used in many modern dance schools, it started with feet placed far apart and pressed flat on the floor. After a slow swinging of the body into ever-increasing circles, came head, shoulder, and torso rolls, with the arms sweeping from the floor to the ceiling followed by a relaxed run around the circumference of the studio, ending in a back fall. Other exercises included Javanese arm movements, and hand stretches to train the dancers Western fingers into going backward into some semblance of Cambodian dance flexibility.

Class always closed with the learning of another part of a dance. Based on the theory that one learns to perform by performing, dance exercises were essential elements in Denishawn training, and some of them were so professionally interesting that they became part of the concert repertory.

Any pupil attending classes at a Denishawn school had a wide array of classes to choose from outside of the consistent technique classes. Ted felt it important that the technique was not all too rigid, like classical ballet, and contained some less-structured forms, which brought classes on Dalcroze eurythmics as well as Delsarte laws of expressionism into the curricula. Ruth, on the other hand, emphasized the origins of dance from the foreign countries of the East, the history behind these techniques, and the method of what she called &quot;music visualization&quot;, and added to the curricula based on these standards. The couple also offered a Hawaiian Hula class taught by the dance instructor Kulamanu, as well as a class taught by Misha Ito that emphasized specificities of the technique to Japanese sword dancing. Outside of movement classes, the school had lectures, music classes, the art of dyeing and the treatment of fabrics, and libraries to study for these courses.

== Schools opened ==
The first school that St. Denis and Shawn opened as partners was an older Spanish-style mansion in the hills of Los Angeles on St. Paul Street. It had an indoor room that was perfectly sized to fit smaller classes, a swimming pool and a tennis court for additional endurance training and/or leisure time, and the estate was filled with eucalyptus trees. Once they settled in, they built their own dancing platform over the tennis court. They also strategically built canopies over the outside space so that they could use it year-round.

There were two spaces in the St. Paul school reserved for technique classes: an indoor studio where St. Denis primarily taught, and an outdoor ballroom for yoga meditations and Shawn&#x27;s various classes (ballet, ballroom and what would later be called &quot;Denishawn&quot; technique). $500 covered the cost of a 12-week program that included daily technique classes, room and board, arts and crafts and guided reading lessons. Regular classes and a lunch at the school would cost one dollar for the students. The fees would be collected in an old cigar box by one of Shawn&#x27;s friends, Mary Jane Sizemore.

During the second summer that the school was opened St. Denis and Shawn decided to hire a manager. Mrs. Edwina Hamilton was brought on staff at the school and was praised by Ruth for her kindness. That winter St. Denis and Shawn went on tour and left the school open and in the hands of Mrs. Hamilton and the assistant teachers. While they were on tour, the registration for upcoming classes looked promising and Mrs. Hamilton suggested that the Denishawn School find a bigger home.

Their second school location in Los Angeles was in an old house in West Lake Park and shared similar characteristics to the St. Paul Street estate. This location had a garden and a tennis court, like the previous school had. Another dance platform was built over the tennis court, a tent was placed over that, and an auditorium was positioned on one side of the area and a dressing room on the opposite side. Eventually, the school went on to spreading farther than just California as Shawn and St. Denis spread their repertory and style through performing. In 1927 they opened a school on Stevenson Place in The Bronx, New York.

==Repertory and performance==
The Denishawn Dancers took advantage of many performance opportunities – in colleges, concert halls, vaudeville theaters, convention centers and outdoor stadiums. Besides being invited to performance venues like New York&#x27;s Palace Theater (1916), Denishawn was the first American company to present &quot;serious Western dance&quot; in Japan, Burma, China, India, Ceylon, Java, Malaya and the Philippines (1925–26) In some ways, the presented work resembled ballet – each piece was a full-company story with elaborate costumes, sets and lighting. In terms of movement, however, the differences were obvious – no pointe shoes, no pas de deux lifts, no exact format for patterning solos and ensemble pieces.

Most Denishawn works fall into one of four categories:
*Orientalia: Chronologically, these were the first true Denishawn works. St. Denis was responsible for the majority of these pieces, though Shawn did put together a small number of Oriental solos and group dances. As their title suggests, these pieces incorporate aspects of East Indian movement, dress and environment (in the form of set design). A particularly famous work from this period is St. Denis&#x27;s &quot;Radha&quot;, a mini-ballet set in a Hindu temple in which an exotic woman dances to honor the five senses.
*Americana: While St. Denis found her most powerful inspiration in the Far East, Shawn seemed to find his in the cultures of America. His works dominate the Americana series, complete with musical scores by American composers and portrayals of &quot;American&quot; characters like cowboys, Indians and ballplayers. Shawn&#x27;s comic pantomime &quot;Danse Americaine&quot;, for example, centers on a soft-shoe dancer acting as a baseball player. 
*Music visualizations: Inspired by Isadora Duncan&#x27;s approach to music, St. Denis developed the music visualization, which she defined as &quot;...the scientific translation into bodily action of the rhythmic, melodic and harmonious structure of a musical composition without intention to in any way &#x27;interpret&#x27; or reveal any hidden meaning apprehended by the dancer&quot;. The meaning is that movement was set strictly to music without reading into it anything emotional. If the music swells, the body swells: if the music grows quiet, the body comes to rest. St. Denis&#x27;s &quot;Soaring&quot;, set on five female dancers, is arguably her most well-known music visualization.
*Miscellanea: Also known as &quot;Denishawn divertissements&quot;, these shorter works included those that cannot fit neatly into the pigeonholes of &quot;Oriental&quot;, &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Music Visualization&quot;. These works were reserved for performances that did not require presentations of full-length ballets.

Many Denishawn solo works remain in the active repertoire of many companies. Their solos are of special interest to many for their exotic qualities. Several of their solos were included in &quot;The Art of the Solo&quot; presented at the Baltimore Museum of Art on September 29, 2006. These included three revival premieres, namely, Shawn&#x27;s &quot;Invocation to the Thunderbird&quot;(1916), last danced by Denishawn dancer John Dougherty, and &quot;Death of Adonis&quot; (1922). Both were recreated by Mino Nicolas, programme curator, with the aid of film, written accounts and photographs. Also featured were the revival premiere of Ruth St. Denis&#x27; &quot;The Peacock/A Legend of India&quot; (1906), which was recreated using the same methods. Her signature solo, &quot;The Incense&quot;, will also be performed by Cynthia Word of Washington, D.C.

== Pupils ==
During its developmental years, the first pupils to join the Denishawn school played a large role in building it up from the ground, and have even been described as &quot;foundation stones of the system that was to spread over the country&quot;. This group included Margaret Loomis, Addie Munn, Helen Eisner, Florine Goodman, Aileen Flaven, Florence Andrews (who danced under the name Florence O&#x27;Denishawn), Sadie Vanderhoff, Carol Dempster, Ada Forman, Claire Niles, Chula Monzon, and Yvonne Sinnard. The majority of these original dancers were related to close acquaintances of St.Denis and Shawn. Another well known student and employee of the Denishawn school was Pearl Wheeler. She was primarily the costumer for the school but also took classes and appeared in performances alongside the other dancers.

Several notable movie stars of the early 20th century studied under the Denishawn school. The Gish sisters, Dorothy and Lillian Gish, took classes from St. Denis and Shawn for some time. Lillian even worked separately with St. Denis and Ruth when she and Rosie Dolly learned a dance from the two that was to be featured in their upcoming movie &quot;The Lily and the Rose&quot; (1915). Other notable movie stars of the time include: Louise Brooks, Ina Claire, Ruth Chatterton, Lenore Ulric, Mabel Normand, Florence Vidor, Colleen Moore, and Myrna Loy. Brooks was 15 years old when she joined Denishawn. The future actress was a member of the Denishawn company for two seasons, 1922-1923 and 1923-1924, and toured throughout the United States and parts of Canada. On a few occasions, Brooks was paired with Ted Shawn in featured dances.

Some pupils who had their beginnings in the Denishawn school went on to make names for themselves , and their presence at the school is sometimes overlooked in their history. For instance, &#x27;Mother of Modern Dance&#x27; Martha Graham joined the school during its second summer. She remained there for over a half decade, learning the technique and eventually becoming a regular instructor. Ruth claimed that during her time there, she was &quot;quiet but asked intelligent questions.&quot; Another two pupils who came to Denishawn in their early careers were Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman. Humphrey moved out to California from Evanston, Illinois to study at the Denishawn school. St. Denis eventually told Humphrey that she should reconsider her plans to become a teacher and pursue a career in performing first. After some time studying at the school&#x27;s West Lake Park, Humphrey and Weidman migrated to New York where they managed Denishawn&#x27;s NY-based Denishawn house to develop their own styles and, eventually, open their own school: the Humphrey-Weidman Dance Company. Another illustrious Denishawn School (and company) alumnus was the jazz-dance innovator and choreographer Jack Cole.

<text>Ettrick and Lauderdale (Eadaraig agus Srath Labhdair in Scottish Gaelic) was one of four local government districts in the Borders region of Scotland as well as a lieutenancy area from 1975 to 1996.

==History==
The district was created on 16 May 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Ettrick and Lauderdale was one of four districts created within the Borders region. The district covered the whole of the historic county of Selkirkshire and parts of the neighbouring counties of Berwickshire, Midlothian, and Roxburghshire. The new district covered all of six former districts and parts of another three districts, which were all abolished at the same time:

&quot;From Selkirkshire:&quot;
*Galashiels Burgh
*Selkirk Royal Burgh
*North District
*South District
&quot;From Berwickshire:&quot;
*Lauder Royal Burgh
*West District (part, being the parishes of Channelkirk, Lauder (landward), Legerwood, Earlston, and Mertoun)
&quot;From Midlothian:&quot;
*Gala Water District (part, being the parishes of Heriot and Stow)
&quot;From Roxburghshire:&quot;
*Melrose Burgh
*Melrose District (part, being the parishes of Bowden, Lilliesleaf, Maxton, Melrose (landward), and St Boswells)

The new district was named after Ettrick Forest (which was also an old alternative name for Selkirkshire), and Lauderdale, being the valley of the Leader Water (roughly corresponding to the area gained from Berwickshire). For lieutenancy purposes, the last lord-lieutenant of the county of Selkirkshire was made lord-lieutenant for the new district when the reforms came into effect in 1975.

In 1989 the district was enlarged by the addition of a small area around the hamlet of Brothershiels from the neighbouring district of Midlothian. The district had an estimated population of 35,490 in 1994.

The Borders region and its four districts were abolished in 1996, merging to form the present Scottish Borders council area. A new lieutenancy area was created at the same time, called Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale, covering the combined area of the abolished districts of Ettrick and Lauderdale and neighbouring Roxburgh.

The former district&#x27;s name is still used in a variety of contexts:
*It forms part of the name of the Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale Scottish Parliament constituency.
*Ettrick and Lauderdale Divisional Court, whose area corresponds to the former district, sits at Selkirk.
*Ettrick and Lauderdale Sports Council promotes interest and participation in sport in the area covered by the former Ettrick and Lauderdale District Council.
*Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale is one of the lieutenancy areas of Scotland.

==Political control==
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats were held by independents:
The last leader of the council, Drew Tulley, went on to be first leader of Scottish Borders Council after the 1996 reforms.

==Premises==
The district council was based at the Council Chambers on Albert Place in Galashiels. The building had originally been built in 1867 as the Burgh Chambers for the old Galashiels Town Council, with a large clock tower added in 1924–1927 which incorporates the town&#x27;s war memorial. A modern extension was added to the rear of the building along Paton Street for the district council in 1976. Since the district council&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building has been an area office for Scottish Borders Council.

<text>Armillaria mellea, commonly known as honey fungus, is an edible basidiomycete fungus in the genus &quot;Armillaria&quot;. It is a plant pathogen and part of a cryptic species complex of closely related and morphologically similar species. It causes Armillaria root rot in many plant species and produces mushrooms around the base of trees it has infected. The symptoms of infection appear in the crowns of infected trees as discoloured foliage, reduced growth, dieback of the branches and death. The mushrooms are edible but some people may be intolerant to them. This species is capable of producing light via bioluminescence in its mycelium.

&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; is widely distributed in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The fruit body or mushroom, commonly known as stump mushroom, stumpie, honey mushroom, pipinky or pinky, grows typically on hardwoods but may be found around and on other living and dead wood or in open areas.

==Taxonomy==

The species was originally named &quot;Agaricus melleus&quot; by Danish-Norwegian botanist Martin Vahl in 1790; it was transferred to the genus &quot;Armillaria&quot; in 1871 by Paul Kummer. Numerous subtaxa have been described:
===Similar species===
&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; once included a range of species with similar features that have since been reclassified. The following are reassigned subtaxa, mostly variety-level entries from the 19th century:

==Description==
The basidiocarp of each has a smooth cap in diameter, convex at first but becoming flattened with age often with a central raised umbo, later becoming somewhat dish-shaped. The margins of the cap are often arched at maturity and the surface is sticky when wet. Though typically honey-coloured, this fungus is rather variable in appearance and sometimes has a few dark, hairy scales near the centre somewhat radially arranged. The gills are white at first, sometimes becoming pinkish-yellow or discoloured with age, broad and fairly distant, attached to the stipe at right angles or are slightly decurrent. The stipe is of variable length, up to about long and in diameter. It is fibrillose and of a firm spongy consistency at first but later becomes hollow. It is cylindrical and tapers to a point at its base where it is fused to the stipes of other mushrooms in the clump. It is whitish at the upper end and brownish-yellow below, often with a very dark-coloured base. There is a broad persistent skin-like ring attached to the upper part of the stipe. This has a velvety margin and yellowish fluff underneath and extends outwards as a white partial veil protecting the gills when young. The flesh of the cap is whitish and has a sweetish odour and flavour with a tinge of bitterness. Under the microscope, the spores are approximately elliptical, 7–9 by 6–7 μm, inamyloid with prominent apiculi (short, pointed projections) at the base. The spore print is white. The basidia (spore-producing structures) lack basal clamps.

The main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. They are bundled together in rhizomorphs that are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia are luminous when in active growth.

=== Pathogenesis ===
&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; infects new hosts through rhizomorphs and basidiospores. It is rare for basidiospores to be successful in infecting new hosts and often colonize woody debris instead, but rhizomorphs, however, can grow up to ten feet long in order to find a new host.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; is widespread in northern temperate zones. It has been found in North America, Europe and northern Asia, and It has been introduced to South Africa. The fungus grows parasitically on a large number of broadleaf trees. It fruits in dense clusters at the base of trunks or stumps.

It has been reported in almost every state with the continental United States.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; prefers moist soil and lower soil temperatures but it can also withstand extreme temperatures, such as forest fires, due to the protection of the soil. It is found in many kinds of landscapes, including gardens, parks, vineyards, tree production areas, and natural landscapes.

&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; typically is symbiotic with hardwood trees and conifers, this includes orchards, planted forests, vineyards, and a few herbaceous plants. There are few signs, and the ones that do exist are often hard to find. The most prominent sign is honey-coloured mushrooms at the base of the infected plant. Additional signs include white, fan-shaped mycelia and black rhizomorphs with diameters between 1/32nd of an inch and 1/8th of an inch. These usually are not as noticeable because they occur beneath the bark and in the soil, respectively. The symptoms are much more numerous, including slower growth, dieback of branches, yellowing foliage, rotted wood at base and/or roots, external cankers, cracking bark, bleeding stem, leaf wilting, defoliation, and rapid death. Leaf wilting, defoliation, and dieback occur after the destruction of the cambium.

It is one of the most common causes of death in trees and shrubs in both natural and human cultivated habitats, and cause steady and substantial losses.

=== Disease cycle ===
&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; infects both through basidiospore and penetration of host species by rhizomorphs which can grow up to long per year to find new, living tissue to infect. However, infection of living host tissue through basidiospores is quite rare. Two basidiospores must germinate and fuse to be viable and produce mycelium. In the late summer and autumn, &quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; produces mushrooms with notched gills, a ring near the cap base, and a white to golden color. They do not always appear, but when they do they can be found on both living and dead trees near the ground. These mushrooms produce and release the sexually created basidiospore which is dispersed by the wind. This is the only spore-bearing phase. The fungus overwinters as either rhizomorphs or vegetative mycelium. Infected wood is weakened through decay in roots and tree base after destruction of the vascular cambium and underlying wood.

Trees become infected by &quot;A. mellea&quot; when rhizomorphs growing through the soil encounter uninfected roots. Alternatively, when infected roots come into contact with uninfected ones the fungal mycelium may grow across. The rhizomorphs invade the trunk, growing between the bark and the wood and causing wood decay, growth reduction and mortality. Trees that are already under stress are more likely to be attacked but healthy trees may also be parasitized. The foliage becomes sparse and discoloured, twig growth slows down and branches may die back. When they are attacked, the Douglas-fir, western larch and some other conifers often produce an extra large crop of cones shortly before dying. Coniferous trees also tend to ooze resin from infected areas whereas broad-leaved trees sometimes develop sunken cankers. A growth of fruiting bodies near the base of the trunk confirms the suspicion of Armillaria root rot.

In 1893, the American mycologist Charles Horton Peck reported finding &quot;Armillaria&quot; fruiting bodies that were &quot;aborted&quot;, in a similar way to specimens of &quot;Entoloma abortivum&quot;. It was not until 1974 that Roy Watling showed that the aborted specimens included cells of both &quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; and &quot;Entoloma abortivum&quot;. He thought that the &quot;Armillaria&quot; was parasitizing the &quot;Entoloma&quot;, a plausible hypothesis given its pathogenic behaviour. However, a 2001 study by Czederpiltz, Volk and Burdsall showed that the &quot;Entoloma&quot; was in fact the microparasite. The whitish-grey malformed fruit bodies known as carpophoroids were the result of &quot;E. abortivum&quot; hyphae penetrating the &quot;Armillaria&quot; and disrupting its normal development.

The main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. The rhizomorphs of A. mellea are initiated from mycelium into multicellular apices of rhizomorphs, which are multicellular vegetative organs that exclude soil from the interior of the rhizomorph tissues. The rhizomorphs spread through far greater distances through the ground than the mycelium. The rhizomorphs are black in this species. The fungal body is not bioluminescent but its mycelia and rhizomorphs are luminous when in active growth. &quot;A. mellea&quot; producing rhizomorphs is parasitic on woody plants of many species, including especially shrubs, hardwood and evergreen trees. In one example, &quot;A. mellea&quot; spread by rhizomorphs from an initially infected tree killed 600 trees in a prune orchard in 6 years. Each infected tree was immediately adjacent to an already infected one, the spread by rhizomorphs through the tree roots and soil.

=== Management ===
There are fungicides or management practices that will kill &quot;A. mellea&quot; after infection without damaging the infected plant, but these practicies are still being studied. There are practices that can extend the life of the plant and prevent further spreading. The best way to extend the plant life is to improve the host condition through supplemental watering and fertilization. To prevent further spread, regulate irrigation to avoid water stress, keep the root collar dry, control defoliating pathogens, remove stumps, fertilize adequately, avoid physical root damage and soil compaction, and don&#x27;t plant trees that are especially susceptible to the disease in places where &quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; has been recorded. There is also some evidence that biological control using the fungus genus &quot;Trichoderma&quot; may help. &quot;Trichoderma&quot; is a predator of &quot;A. mellea&quot; and is often found in woodchips. Therefore, chipping or grinding dead and infected roots will give &quot;Trichoderma&quot; its preferred habitat and help it proliferate. Solarization will also create an ideal habitat as dry soil and higher soil temperatures are preferable for &quot;Trichoderma&quot; but poor conditions for &quot;A. mellea.&quot;

==Edibility==

&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot; mushroom are considered good edibles, though not preferred by some, and the tough stalks are usually excluded. They are best collected when young and thoroughly cooked. Some individuals have reported &quot;allergic&quot; reactions that result in stomach upsets. Some authors suggest not collecting mushrooms from the wood of various trees, including hemlock, buckeye, eucalyptus, and locust. They may have been used medicinally by indigenous peoples as a laxative.

The mushrooms have a taste that has been described as slightly sweet and nutty, with a texture ranging from chewy to crunchy, depending on the method of preparation. Parboiling mushrooms before consuming removes the bitter taste present in some specimens, and may reduce the amount of gastrointestinal irritants. According to one guide, they must be cooked before eating. Drying the mushrooms preserves and intensifies their flavour, although reconstituted mushrooms tend to be tough to eat. The mushrooms can also be pickled and roasted.

==Chemistry==
Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies. The triterpenes 3β-hydroxyglutin-5-ene, friedelane-2α,3β-diol, and friedelin were reported in 2011. Indole compounds include tryptamine, and serotonin.

The fungus produces cytotoxic compounds known as melleolides. Melleolides are made from orsellinic acid and protoilludane sesquiterpene alcohols via esterification. A polyketide synthase gene, termed &quot;ArmB&quot;, was identified in the genome of the fungus, which was found expressed during melleolide production. The gene shares c. 42% similarity with the orsellinic acid synthase gene (&quot;OrsA&quot;) in &quot;Aspergillus nidulans&quot;. Characterization of the gene proved it to catalyze orsillinic acid in vitro. It is a non-reducing iterative type-1 polyketide synthase. Co-incubation of free orsellinic acid with alcohols and ArmB showed cross-coupling activity. Therefore, the enzyme has transesterification activity. Also, there are other auxiliary factors suspected to control substrate specificity. Additionally, halogen modifications have been observed. Overexpression of annotated halogenases (termed &quot;ArmH1-5&quot;) and characterization of the subsequent enzymes revealed in all five enzymes the chlorination of mellolide F. In vitro reactions of free standing substrates showed that the enzymes do not require auxiliary carrier proteins for substrate delivery.

<text>Jacques Loussier (26 October 1934 – 5 March 2019) was a French pianist and composer. He arranged jazz interpretations of many of the works of Johann Sebastian Bach, such as the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;. The Jacques Loussier Trio, founded in 1959, played more than 3,000 concerts and sold more than 7 million recordings—mostly in the Bach series. Loussier composed film scores and a number of classical pieces, including a Mass, a ballet, and violin concertos. His style is described as third stream, a synthesis of jazz and classical music, with an emphasis on improvisation.

== Early life and education ==
Loussier was born on 26 October 1934 in Angers, France. He started piano lessons there at age ten. When he was eleven, he heard a piece from the &quot;Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach.&quot; In a 2003 interview, he said, &quot;I was studying this piece and I just fell in love with it. Then I found I loved to play the music, but add my own notes, expanding the harmonies and playing around with that music.&quot; At 13, he met pianist Yves Nat in Paris, who regularly gave him projects for three months, after which he returned for another lesson.

== Career ==
Loussier began composing music while studying at the Conservatoire National Musique, having moved by then to Paris, with Nat, from the age of 16. At a competition at the conservatory, he played a prelude by Bach, and when his memory failed, he improvised. He later said that he only followed a tradition, because musicians of the 18th century—including Bach—were great improvisers. Loussier played jazz in Paris bars to finance his studies. Fusing Bach and jazz was unique at the time. After six years of study, he travelled to the Middle East and Latin America, where he was inspired by different sounds. He stayed in Cuba for a year.

Early in his career, Loussier was an accompanist for singers Frank Alamo, Charles Aznavour, Léo Ferré and Catherine Sauvage. In 1959, he formed the Jacques Loussier Trio with string bass player Pierre Michelot—who had played with Django Reinhardt and the Quintette du Hot Club de France—and percussionist Christian Garros. They used Bach&#x27;s compositions as a base for jazz improvisation and made many live appearances, tours, and concerts, as well as a number of recordings. They began with Decca Records but changed to Philips/Phonogram in 1973. They sold over six million albums in 15 years. Their best-known recording is &quot;Air on the G String&quot;, which was used to advertise Hamlet cigars in the UK for over 30 years.

In the mid-1970s, the trio was dissolved. Loussier set up his own recording studio, Studio Miraval, which opened in 1977, where he worked on compositions for acoustic and electric instruments. He recorded with musicians such as Pink Floyd, Elton John, Sting, Chris Rea, and Sade. Parts of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Wall&quot; were recorded there.

In 1985, the tricentenary of Bach&#x27;s birth, Loussier revived the trio with percussionist André Arpino and bassist Vincent Charbonnier. Bassist Benoit Dunoyer de Segonzac has also played in the trio, replacing Charbonnier—whose left hand was affected by a stroke, resulting in his being unable to continue to play the bass—on a number of albums and concerts from at least as early as 1998 (on the album &quot;Satie: Gymnopédies Gnossiennes&quot;). Besides Bach, the trio recorded interpretations of compositions by Handel, Scarlatti, Vivaldi, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin, Satie, Debussy, Ravel, and Schumann. A 2005 recording, &quot;Take Bach&quot;, by the trio with the Pekinel sisters, features adaptations of Bach&#x27;s concertos for two and three pianos. Loussier&#x27;s last albums, &quot;My Personal Favorites&quot; and &quot;Beyond Bach, Other Composers I Adore&quot;, were released in 2014 on the occasion of his 80th birthday.
In March 2002, Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against rapper Eminem and &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; executive producer Dr. Dre, claiming that the beat for the track &quot;Kill You&quot; was stolen from his composition &quot;Pulsion&quot;. He demanded that all sales of the album be halted and any remaining copies destroyed. The case was settled out of court.

== Death ==
Loussier suffered a stroke during a performance at the Klavier-Festival Ruhr on 14 July 2011 and retired from the stage. He died on 5 March 2019 at the age of 84.

== Compositions ==
Loussier composed the music for over 100 films, made for cinema and television series, beginning with &quot;The Happy Sixties&quot; in 1963. These included the scores for the films &quot;Heaven on One&#x27;s Head&quot; (1965), &quot;À Belles Dents&quot; (1966), &quot;The Killing Game&quot; (1967), &quot;Dark of the Sun&quot; (1968), &quot;Monique&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Man Who Went Up in Smoke&quot; (1980), the theme tune for the popular 1960s French TV series &quot;Thierry la Fronde&quot;, and the original sign-on music for &quot;La 3e chaîne&quot;, the predecessor television channel to France 3.

Loussier also composed a trumpet concerto, two violin concertos, and music for a ballet, among other pieces. His Mass, &quot;Lumières: Messe Baroque du 21e Siècle&quot; (&quot;Lights: A Baroque Mass of the 21st Century&quot;), has been compared to Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Mass&quot;.

<doc id="561893" wikidata="Q1970825" url="?curid=561893" title="Type 93 torpedo">
<text>The was a -diameter torpedo of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), launched from surface ships. It is commonly referred to as the Long Lance by most modern English-language naval historians, a nickname given to it after the war by Samuel Eliot Morison, the chief historian of the U.S. Navy, who spent much of the war in the Pacific Theater. In Japanese references, the term is also used, in reference to its propulsion system. It was the most advanced naval torpedo in the world at the time.

== History and development ==
The Type 93&#x27;s development (in parallel with a submarine-launched model, the Type 95) began in Japan in 1928, under the auspices of Rear Admiral Kaneji Kishimoto and Captain Toshihide Asakuma, as an evolution of the -diameter Type 90 pneumatic torpedo. The torpedo design was inspired by the British oxygen-enriched torpedoes used on the s, a naval officer believed them to be oxygen-fuelled and it led to restarting research at Kure. At the time, the most powerful potential enemy of the Japanese Navy was the United States Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet. The U.S. Navy&#x27;s doctrine, presuming an invasion by Japan of the Philippines (an American commonwealth at that time), called for the battle line to fight its way across the Pacific Ocean, relieve or recapture the Philippines, and destroy the Japanese fleet. Since the IJN had fewer battleships than the U.S. Navy, it planned to use light forces (light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines) to whittle down the U.S. Navy&#x27;s fleet in a succession of minor battles, mostly at night. After the number of American warships was sufficiently reduced, the IJN would commit its own presumably fresh and undamaged battleships to finish off the U.S. remnants in one huge climactic battle. (This was essentially what the U.S. Navy&#x27;s &quot;War Plan Orange&quot; expected.)

The Japanese Navy invested heavily in developing a large, heavy, and long-range torpedo, the Type 93. Torpedoes were the only weapon that gave small warships, such as destroyers, the potential to cripple or sink battleships. The IJN&#x27;s torpedo research and development focused on using highly compressed oxygen instead of compressed air as the fuel oxidizer in the torpedo&#x27;s propulsion system. These torpedoes used an otherwise normal wet-heater engine burning a fuel such as Kerosene. Since air is only 21% oxygen (and 78% nitrogen), pure oxygen provides nearly five times as much oxidizer in the same tank volume, thereby increasing torpedo range. In addition, the absence of the inert nitrogen resulted in the emission of significantly less exhaust gas, comprising only carbon dioxide, which is significantly soluble in water, and water vapor, thus greatly reducing tell-tale bubble trails.

Compressed oxygen is dangerous to handle and required lengthy research and development, not to mention additional training for the warship&#x27;s torpedomen, for safe operational use. Eventually, the IJN&#x27;s weapons development engineers found that by starting the torpedo&#x27;s engine with compressed air, and then gradually switching to pure oxygen, they were able to overcome the problem of explosions that had hampered it before. To conceal the use of pure oxygen from the ship&#x27;s crew and any potential enemy, the oxygen tank was named the &quot;secondary air tank&quot;. The pure oxygen torpedo was first deployed by the IJN in 1935.

== Specification ==
Some specification examples of ranges by speed:
* at (13.6 miles)
* at (20.5 miles)
* at (25.1 miles)

However, the IJN announced officially the maximum performance of the Type 93 was at .

The stated range of over was effective when the targeted warship steamed straight for more than a few minutes while the torpedo approached. This sometimes occurred when USN cruisers chased IJN destroyers breaking away from the scene of the battle at high speed during the night, or when American fleet carriers, engaged in flight operations, were targeted by IJN submarines in the South Pacific in 1942–43.

The Type 93 weighed about , with a high explosive warhead of about of Shimose powder type 97, explosive, which was about 7% more powerful than straight TNT.

Rear Admiral Jungo Rai explained this weapon in the chapter &quot;Torpedo&quot;, in collective work &quot;The Full Particulars of Secret Weapons&quot; (秘密兵器の全貌), first published by Koyo-sha, Japan, in 1952.

The Type 93 torpedo had a main chamber filled with pure compressed oxygen, a joint regulator valve preventing reverse flow, and a small (approximately 13-liter) high-pressure air tank. First, compressed air was mixed with fuel, and the mixture was supplied to a heat starter. Ignition started gently, with the mixture burning steadily in the engine (if oxygen was used at this stage, explosions were common). As the compressed air was consumed and lost pressure, high-pressure oxygen was supplied from the main chamber through the joint valve into the compressed air tank. Soon the air tank was filled with pure oxygen, and combustion continued in the engine.

The torpedo needed careful maintenance. Warships equipped with Type 93 torpedo launchers required an oxygen generator system to use this type of torpedo.

=== Development of Kaiten from the Type 93 ===

The rotational speed of the gyrocompass was increased to 20,000 rpm for the Kaiten manned torpedo. The warhead of the Type 93 torpedo was (the same as the 1-ton gun of an Imperial Japanese battleship), increased to 1.6 tons for Kaiten.

The Type 93 torpedo is long and weighs about three tons, while the Kaiten was long and weighed eight tons. The maximum speed of the Type 93 was and range . The Kaiten had a range of at , and at . The Kaiten had a stable slow cruising capability just beneath the surface.

==Operational history==
The Type 93 had a maximum range of at with a high explosive warhead. Its long range, high speed, and heavy warheads provided a formidable punch in surface battles. In contrast, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s standard surface-launched torpedo of World War II, the Mark 15, had a maximum range of at , or at , with a significantly smaller warhead; torpedoes of other Allied nations did not have longer range. The Type 93 was launched from torpedo tubes mounted on the decks of IJN destroyers and cruisers; some Japanese destroyers, unlike ships of other navies, mounted their banks of torpedo tubes in turrets offering protection against splinters, and had tube loaders. The IJN armed nearly all of its cruisers with Type 93 torpedoes.

The long range of the type 93 enabled them to score the two longest ranged torpedo hits ever fired. At the battle of the Java Sea, February 27, 1942, the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot; launched a torpedo from 22,000 yards which hit and sank the Dutch destroyer &quot;Kortenaer&quot;. Shortly before the battle of Kula Gulf, July 5, 1943, the destroyer &quot;Niizuki&quot; launched a torpedo that hit and sank the destroyer USS &quot;Strong&quot;. Sources differ on the exact range, but some put the range at nearly 22,000 yards.

In the early surface battles of 1942–43, Japanese destroyers and cruisers were able to launch their torpedoes from about at the unsuspecting Allied warships attempting to close to gun range. The Allied warships expected that, if torpedoes were used, they would be fired from not more than , their own typical torpedo range. The many torpedo hits suffered by Allied warships in such engagements led their officers to believe torpedoes had been fired by undetected Japanese submarines operating in concert with the surface warships. On rare occasions, stray Type 93s struck ships at a much longer range than their intended targets, leading the Allies on occasion to suspect their ships had been mined. The capabilities of the Type 93 went mostly unrecognized by the Allies until examples were captured intact in 1943.

A version, the Type 97, was later developed for midget submarines, but was not a success, and was replaced operationally by Japan&#x27;s standard aerial torpedo, the Type 91. A version for use by a few IJN submarines was designated the Type 95, and it was ultimately successful.

A disadvantage of the Type 93 was that its Shimose explosive warhead was far more likely to detonate due to shock than a TNT-loaded torpedo. The explosion from one Type 93, with its heavy warhead, was usually enough to sink the destroyer, or heavily damage the cruiser, carrying it. As American air strikes against IJN ships became more common, captains of destroyers and cruisers under air attack had to decide whether or not to jettison torpedoes to prevent them from being detonated during the attack. In one instance, the heavy cruiser &quot;Chikuma&quot; jettisoned her Type 93s just before being hit by bombs from several USN dive bombers at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. It was initially believed that during the Battle off Samar (in the eastern Philippines) a shell from escort carrier USS &quot;White Plains&quot; struck the heavy cruiser &quot;Chōkai&quot; which detonated the cruiser&#x27;s Type 93 torpedoes, causing damage that forced the ship to be scuttled; however, the 2019 discovery by the RV Petrel of the wreck of the &quot;Chōkai&quot; with her torpedoes intact disproved this theory. The same Samar engagement saw the heavy cruiser &quot;Suzuya&quot; sunk by the detonation of her Type 93 torpedoes: a bomb near miss starboard amidships set off the torpedoes in the starboard tube mounts; the resultant fires propagated to other torpedoes nearby and beyond; the subsequent explosions damaged one of the boilers and the starboard engine rooms and eventually reached the main magazines.

===Ships sunk by Type 93 torpedo===
While the Type 93 torpedo was dangerous to its user as well as its intended target, the Imperial Japanese Navy felt that its effectiveness outweighed its risks. During the course of the war, 22 Allied warships were sunk after Type 93 hits: 11 cruisers, 11 destroyers, and one fleet aircraft carrier. Thirteen of these had been fatally hit solely by the Type 93, with the rest succumbing to a combination of bombs, gunfire, and torpedoes.

<text>The loquat (Eriobotrya japonica, Chinese: 枇杷; Pinyin: pípá) is a large evergreen shrub or tree grown commercially for its orange fruit. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant.

The loquat is in the family Rosaceae and is native to the cooler hill regions of south-central China. In Japan, the loquat has been grown for over 1,000 years. It has been introduced to regions with subtropical to mild temperate climates throughout the world.

&quot;Eriobotrya japonica&quot; was formerly thought to be closely related to the genus &quot;Mespilus&quot; and is still sometimes mistakenly known as the Japanese medlar, which is the name it takes in other European languages, such as in Spanish or in Italian. It is also known as Japanese plum and Chinese plum.

==Etymology==

The name loquat derives from Cantonese &quot;lou4 gwat1&quot; (). The phrase &#x27;black orange&#x27; originally referred to unripened kumquats, which are dark green in color, but the name was mistakenly applied to the loquat by the ancient Chinese poet Su Shi when he was residing in southern China, and the mistake was widely taken up by the Cantonese region thereafter.

In Louisiana, many refer to loquats as &quot;misbeliefs&quot; (from the Louisiana Creole word for the tree, mísplís) and they grow in the yards of many homes.

==Description==

&quot;E. japonica&quot; is a large, evergreen shrub or small tree, with a rounded crown, short trunk, and woolly new twigs. The tree can grow to tall but is often smaller, about . The fruit begins to ripen during spring to summer, depending on the temperature in the area. The leaves are alternate, simple, long, dark green, tough and leathery in texture, with a serrated margin, and densely velvety-hairy below with thick yellow-brown pubescence; the young leaves are also densely pubescent above, but this soon rubs off.

===Fruit===
Loquats are unusual among fruit trees in that the flowers appear in the autumn or early winter, and the fruits are ripe at any time from early spring to early summer. The flowers are in diameter, white, with five petals, and produced in stiff panicles of three to ten flowers. The flowers have a sweet, heady aroma that can be smelled from a distance.

Loquat fruits, growing in clusters, are oval, rounded or pear-shaped, long, with a smooth or downy, yellow or orange, sometimes red-blushed skin. The succulent, tangy flesh is white, yellow, or orange and sweet to subacid or acid, depending on the cultivar.

Each fruit contains from one to ten ovules, with three to five being the most common. Several ovules mature into large, brown seeds (with different numbers of seeds appearing in each fruit on the same tree, usually between one and four).
== Taxonomy ==

The first European record of the species might have been in the 17th century by Michał Boym, a Polish jesuit, orientalist, politician, and missionary to China. He described loquat in his &quot;Flora sinensis&quot;, the first European natural history book about China. The common name for the fruit is from the Portuguese &quot;nêspera&quot; (from the modified &quot;nespilus&quot;, originally &quot;mespilus&quot;, which referred to the medlar), (José Pedro Machado, Dicionário Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa, 1967). Since the first contact of the Portuguese with the Japanese and Chinese dates also from the 16th century, possibly some were brought back to Europe, as was likely the case with other species such as the &#x27;Hachiya&#x27; persimmon variety.

&quot;E. japonica&quot; was again described in Europe by Carl Peter Thunberg, as &quot;Mespilus japonica&quot; in 1780, and was relocated to the genus &quot;Eriobotrya&quot; (from Greek εριο &quot;wool&quot; and βοτρυών &quot;cluster&quot;) by John Lindley, who published these changes in 1821.This fruit is also found in abundance in the north west Pakistan region.

The most common variety in Portugal is the late-ripening &#x27;Tanaka&#x27;, where it is popular in gardens and backyards, but not commercially produced. In northern Portugal, it is also popularly called &quot;magnório&quot; or &quot;magnólio&quot;, probably having to do with French botanist Pierre Magnol. In Spain, the fruits are similarly called &quot;nísperos&quot; and are commercially exploited, Spain being the second-largest producer worldwide, after China, with 41,487 t annually, half of which is destined to export markets.

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant is originally from China, where related species can be found growing in the wild. It has become naturalised in Georgia, Argentina, Armenia, Afghanistan, Australia, Azerbaijan, Bermuda, Brazil, Chile, Kenya, Syria, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Israel, South Africa, the whole Mediterranean Basin, Pakistan, New Zealand, Réunion, Tonga, Central America, Mexico, South America and warmer parts of the United States (Hawaii, California, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina).

==Cultivation==

=== History ===
The plant has been cultivated in China for over 1,000 years. Chinese immigrants are presumed to have carried the loquat to Hawaii and California. It has been cultivated in Japan for about 1,000 years and presumably the fruits and seeds were brought back from China to Japan by the many Japanese scholars visiting and studying in China during the Tang dynasty.

Over 800 loquat cultivars exist in Asia. Self-fertile variants include the &#x27;Gold Nugget&#x27; and &#x27;Mogi&#x27; cultivars. The loquat is easy to grow in subtropical to mild temperate climates, where it is often primarily grown as an ornamental plant, especially for its sweet-scented flowers, and secondarily for its delicious fruit. The boldly textured foliage adds a tropical look to gardens, contrasting well with many other plants.
The many named cultivars have orange or white flesh. Some cultivars are intended for home growing, where the flowers open gradually, thus the fruit also ripens gradually, compared to the commercially grown species where the flowers open almost simultaneously, and the whole tree&#x27;s fruit also ripen together.

China is the biggest producer of loquat in the world, more than five times the production of the second-largest producer, Spain, followed by Pakistan and Turkey. In Europe, Spain is the main producer of loquat.

In temperate climates, it is grown as an ornamental with winter protection, as the fruits seldom ripen to an edible state. In the United Kingdom, it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

In the United States, the loquat tree is hardy in USDA zones 8 and above, and will flower only where winter temperatures do not fall below . In such areas, the tree flowers in autumn and the fruit ripens in late winter. It is popular in the southeastern United States. In the United States, cultivation is typically within the southeastern and temperate west coast regions. The one advantage the loquat has among others, though, is its fruit becomes available in late April – early May around a time many other fruits are not ready yet.

Loquats have been reported to survive temperatures as cold as for short periods of time. The loquat grows poorly if the temperature is &quot;too tropical&quot;, but at what maximum temperature it can be cultivated is unclear.

Altitude is an important factor to consider, as well. Loquats grow naturally from . The right altitudes varies depending on the temperature or how close it is to the equator. This contributes to why higher altitudes in China or the Andes Mountains make excellent cultivating spots.

China is a major country where loquats grow natively and wild in forests around the mountains. Loquats are cultivated on around with hundreds of different varieties.

In Russia, loquat produces fruits in subtropical and near-subtropical areas (Gelendzhik, Sochi). It also produces fruits in subtropical areas of Georgia.

In Canada, it can be found growing in Vancouver, though it does not produce fruit. More frost-resistant varieties grow and produce fruit in Sidney, British Columbia, though not every year.

Loquat grows differently in tropical climates, typically blooming two or three times a year. Loquats usually mature 90 days after the bloom.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===

The loquat is low in sodium and high in vitamin A, vitamin B6, dietary fiber, potassium, and manganese.

Like most related plants, the seeds (pips) and young leaves of the plant are slightly poisonous, containing small amounts of cyanogenic glycosides (including amygdalin) which release cyanide when digested, though the low concentration and bitter flavour normally prevent enough being eaten to cause harm.

=== Culinary ===
The loquat has high sugar, acid, and pectin contents. It is eaten as a fresh fruit and mixes well with other fruits in fresh fruit salads or fruit cups. The fruit is also commonly used to make jam, jelly, and chutney, and is often served poached in light syrup. Firm, slightly immature fruits are best for making pies or tarts, while the fruits are the sweetest when soft and orange. The fruit is sometimes canned or processed into confections. The waste ratio is 30% or more, due to the seed size.

The loquat can also be used in juices or smoothies. In South American countries such as Ecuador, the loquat can be used for &quot;batidos&quot;, where they are mixed with milk, ice, or other fruits.

An American writer calls the loquat&#x27;s flavor &quot;floral&quot; with hints of apricot and peach, with the fruit&#x27;s natural sweetness contributing to its popularity.

Loquats are used commonly as a natural sweetener for many different types of food, and are used to make marmalade and jelly in various locales. Many people use loquats to create sauces and other juices, since the acidity goes well with the sweetness, another reason why they are popular for making pies and other pastries.

Loquats are often eaten as a fresh fruit, but need to have the seeds removed to be ready to eat. The seeds not only take up a great deal of space relative to the size of the fruit (&quot;cf.&quot; avocado), but also are slightly poisonous in large quantities. The fruit is often peeled, but the peel is edible and not overly thick. 

==== Alcoholic beverages ====
Loquats can also be used to make light wine. They are fermented into a fruit wine, sometimes using just crystal sugar and white liquor.

The liquor &quot;nespolino&quot; is made from the seeds, reminiscent of nocino and amaretto, both prepared from nuts and apricot kernels. Both the loquat seeds and the apricot kernels contain cyanogenic glycosides, but the drinks are prepared from varieties that contain only small quantities (such as &#x27;Mogi&#x27; and &#x27;Tanaka&#x27;), so the risk of cyanide poisoning is minimal.

=== Other uses ===
Some other uses for loquat include making animal feed and medicine to counter vomiting and thirst. The loquat&#x27;s wood is used as an alternative to pear wood and works well to make rulers/other writing instruments. The loquat&#x27;s flowers are used to make perfume in Europe, although its yield is considered low. Powdered loquat leaves are also used to treat diarrhea, depression, and to help counteract alcoholic intoxication.

==In culture==
The loquat was often mentioned in medieval Chinese literature, such as the poems of Li Bai. Its original name is no longer used in most Chinese dialects and has been replaced by &quot;pipa&quot; (), which is a reference to the fruit&#x27;s visual resemblance to a miniature pipa lute.

Because of its golden colour, the &quot;pipa&quot; represents gold and wealth in China. It is often one in a bowl or composite of fruits and vegetables (such as spring onions, artemisia leaves, pomegranates, kumquats, etc.) to represent auspicious wishes or the Five Prosperities or &quot;wurui&quot; (五瑞).

<text>Roxburgh () is a civil parish and formerly a royal burgh, in the historic county of Roxburghshire in the Scottish Borders, Scotland. It was an important trading burgh in High Medieval to early modern Scotland. In the Middle Ages it had at least as much importance as Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, or Berwick-upon-Tweed, for a time acting as &quot;de facto&quot; capital (as royal residence of David I).

==History==
Its significance lay in its position in the centre of some of Lowland Scotland&#x27;s most agriculturally fertile areas, and its position upon the River Tweed, which allowed river transport of goods via the main seaport of Berwick-upon-Tweed. Its position also acted as a barrier to English invasion.

Standing on a defensible peninsula between the rivers Tweed and Teviot, with Roxburgh Castle guarding the narrow neck of the peninsula, it was a settlement of some importance during the reign of David I who conferred Royal Burgh status upon the town. At its zenith, between the reigns of William the Lion and James II, it was the site of the Royal mint. The town also had three churches and schools which operated under the auspices of the monks of Kelso Abbey. In 1237, the future Alexander III was born there.

English and Scots forces repeatedly captured and recaptured the town during the Scottish Wars of Independence. During his occupation of Scotland, Edward III of England resided at Roxburgh Castle, spending at least two birthdays there. The castle was besieged several times, notably in 1314, in the run-up to Bannockburn. Its final recapture in 1460 saw the town and castle destroyed. After this time the town never regained its importance because the final English capture of Berwick-upon-Tweed in 1482 left Roxburgh with little reason to exist, henceforth lacking a port.

Nothing remains standing of the town except some ruined segments of castle ramparts. Its site lies to the south of modern Kelso and Floors Castle, which lie on the other side of the Tweed. Roxburgh was superseded as the county town of the former county of Roxburghshire by Jedburgh.

Very little else is known about this site, in part due to the landowner Duke of Roxburghe&#x27;s refusal to allow archaeologists to dig until the Channel Four television programme &quot;Time Team&quot; undertook excavation work in 2003. Their findings were broadcast on 21 March 2004.

==Etymology==
Roxburgh probably comes from Old English &quot;*hrōcas burh&quot;, &quot;rook&#x27;s burgh&quot;.

==Roxburgh village==

Today the name Roxburgh belongs to a small village about south-southwest of the site of the historic Roxburgh.

<text>The Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk (previously designated the XP-87) was a prototype American all-weather jet fighter-interceptor, and the company&#x27;s last aircraft project. Designed as a replacement for the World War II–era propeller-driven P-61 Black Widow night/interceptor aircraft, the XF-87 lost in government procurement competition to the Northrop F-89 Scorpion. The loss of the contract was fatal to the company; the Curtiss-Wright Corporation closed down its aviation division, selling its assets to North American Aviation.

==Design and development==
The aircraft started life as a project for an attack aircraft, designated XA-43. When the United States Army Air Forces issued a requirement for a jet-powered all-weather fighter in 1945, the design was reworked for that request.

The XP-87 was a large mid-wing aircraft with four engines paired in underwing pods, with a mid-mounted tailplane and tricycle undercarriage. Two crew members (pilot and radar operator) sat side by side under a single canopy. Armament was to be a nose-mounted, powered turret containing four 20 mm (0.79 in) cannon, but this was never fitted to the prototypes. Instead the aircraft was armed with four fixed forward firing 20mm cannon.

==Operational history==
The first flight of the XF-87 Blackhawk was on 5 March 1948. Although the top speed was slower than expected, the aircraft was otherwise acceptable, and the newly formed (in September 1947) United States Air Force placed orders for 57 F-87A fighters and 30 RF-87A reconnaissance aircraft just over a month later. Since the performance problems were due to lack of power, the four Westinghouse XJ34-WE-7 turbojets of the prototypes were to be substituted for two General Electric J47 jets in production models. One of the two XF-87 prototypes was to be modified as a test bed for the new engines.

At this point, the USAF decided that the Northrop F-89 Scorpion was a more promising aircraft. The F-87 contract was canceled on 10 October 1948, and both prototypes were scrapped.

<doc id="561903" wikidata="Q1537486" url="?curid=561903" title="HNLMS De Ruyter (1935)">
<text>HNLMS&quot; De Ruyter&quot; () was a light cruiser of the Royal Netherlands Navy. She was the seventh ship of the Dutch Navy to be named after Admiral Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter.

&quot;De Ruyter&quot; was originally designed as a ship with a lighter armament due to the financial problems of the Great Depression and a pacifist movement in the Netherlands. Later on in the design stage, an extra gun turret was added and the armor was improved. 

&quot;De Ruyter&quot; was laid down on 16 September 1933 at the Wilton-Fijenoord dockyard in Schiedam and commissioned on 3 October 1936, commanded by Captain A. C. van der Sande Lacoste. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; spent her early war career taking part in peacetime patrol and escorting duties, mostly in the waters surrounding the Dutch East Indies. When the Netherlands was invaded by Nazi Germany in May 1940, she retreated to the Dutch East Indies, where she eventually served as flagship for ABDA Force.

&quot;De Ruyter&quot; survived the air attacks at the Battle of Makassar Strait undamaged, before attempting to intercept a Japanese troop convoy at the battle of Badung Strait, but missing her shots and retreated from the battle after her escorting destroyers were either sunk or incapacitated. She saw her last action attempting to intercept another Japanese troop convoy at the battle of the Java Sea, but failed to make a single hit while being damaged herself and retreating. Later that night, Japanese cruisers caught the force in an ambush; &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was hit by a torpedo fired from the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;, causing her to capsize and sink over three hours with the loss of the majority of her crew.

Her wreck was discovered in 2002, but later completely destroyed by illegal salvagers.

==Design==

&quot;De Ruyter&quot; was designed during the Great Depression, which, in addition to being a period of economic depression, was also a period in which pacifism was widespread in the Netherlands. For these reasons, the design was officially called a &quot;flottieljeleider&quot; (flotilla leader) instead of a cruiser, and every effort was made to cut costs.

Its function was to aid the two existing cruisers of the in the defence of the Dutch East Indies; the idea was that with three cruisers, there would always be two cruisers available, even if one cruiser had to be repaired.

However, due to the cost-cutting policy that went into her design, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was not quite up to her task. Her main battery (7 × 150 mm guns) was underpowered in comparison to other light cruisers of the time (for example the British ), and the class had inadequate armour as well and lacked long range anti-aircraft guns. However, her fire control system was excellent.

==Service history==

Upon completion on October 3, 1936, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; would operation in various Dutch and other European waters. However, on January 12, 1937, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; departed under the command of Captain Sande Lacoste for her designed role, to protect operations in the Dutch East Indies, a series of Dutch owned Asian Islands surrounding Indonesia, where she arrived at Tandjong Priok on March 5. From then on until that October, &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, alongside several destroyers and both Java class light cruisers vigorously took part in training exercises to ready her crew for battle. For several years, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; saw a quiet career operating off Dutch East Indies waters on patrol and escorting duties. However, by May 1939, patrol duties increased significantly due to increasing tension with both the Japanese near the Dutch East Indies, and Nazi Germany near the homelands.

== WWII ==
On September 1, 1939, Germany attacked Poland, which was the catalyst that officially started the Second World War. Upon the start of the war, Captain Karel Doorman was given the command of &quot;De Ruyter,&quot; but would not see combat initially due to the Netherland&#x27;s neutrality in WW2. However, on May 10, 1940, Germany without a declaration of war invaded the Netherlands, and through intense combat took control of the country by the 29th. Karel Doorman was promoted to a Rear Admiral on the 16th, and once the Netherlands was taken over, rather than join the Nazis, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; along with numerous other Dutch ships escaped to the Dutch East Indies. From then on, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; took on various patrol duties due to the lack of action. 

This lack of action changed on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese aircraft carriers of the Kido Butai attacked Pearl Harbor, and Japanese forces executed an invasion of the Dutch East Indies. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and the other handful of older Dutch warships simply weren&#x27;t anywhere near enough to turn back the might of the Japanese surface fleet, which tasked some of its most modern heavy cruisers and destroyers to assist in capturing the vital oil fields in the Dutch East Indies desperately needed for the war effort. Because of this, the Dutch admiralty asked for the assistance of other countries. The Americans were the first to join, followed by Australia and then New Zealand. The four countries then convinced Winston Churchill to send a number of British warships to assist in the defense of the Dutch territories. ABDA Force was thus formed, and &quot;De Ruyter&quot; served an important role as Karel Doorman&#x27;s flagship for the fleet.

On December 22, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; escorted Troop Convoy BM 9B from Bombay to Singapore, then escorted Troop Convoy DM 1 on December 30, and took part in a series of smaller scale escorting duties throughout January 1942. On February 3, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; served as the flagship of an allied force of two other light cruisers, one heavy cruiser, and seven destroyers in an attempt to intercept and sink Japanese troop convoys. However, while underway the next day off the Bali Sea, the allied ABDA ships came under attack from some 60 twin engine Japanese land based bombers in a series of air attacks that became known as the battle of Makassar Strait. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was not damaged, but the light cruiser USS &quot;Marblehead&quot; was hit by two bombs that forced her back to the US for repairs and out of the ABDA fleet permanently, while the heavy cruiser USS &quot;Houston&quot; was critically damaged by a bomb hit that disabled her number three main battery turret. As a result, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and the rest of the task force turned back and retreated to the coast of Java, while the Japanese successfully took control of the Makassar Strait.

=== Battle of the Badung Strait ===
On February 18, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; departed the Java coast alongside the light cruiser HNLMS &quot;Java&quot; and the destroyers USS &quot;Pope&quot;, USS &quot;John D. Ford&quot;, and HNLMS &quot;Piet Hein&quot; in another attempt to disrupt Japanese troop convoys destined to Bali Indonesia consisting of two troop transports escorted by four destroyers of the Asashio class which was spotted by allied submarines. It was on the night of the 19th that the allied ships intercepted the Japanese ships. For the first time, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; fired her 15 cm (5.9 in) guns in anger, but her gunfire proved to be ineffective as she missed her shots. 

In the following exchange, the lone Japanese destroyer &quot;Asashio&quot; closed to point blank range without damage and fired eight torpedoes. One of these torpedoes hit &quot;Piet Hein&quot;, which was blown in half and sank nearly instantly. &quot;Asashio&quot;, joined by her sistership &quot;Ōshio&quot;, then turned away &quot;John D. Ford&quot; and &quot;Pope&quot;; with her escorts out of the fight, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; retreated from the battle without hitting an enemy ship even once, let alone sinking the pesky Japanese transport ships.

Another failed attempt by Allied warships to sink the pesky transport ships failed; instead, &quot;Asashio&quot; won a gunfight with the light cruiser HNLMS &quot;Tromp&quot;, followed by both &quot;Asashio&quot; and &quot;Ōshio&quot; damaging the destroyer USS &quot;Stewart&quot; so badly that she could not be repaired before Japanese capture of Soerabaia, and was scuttled in the harbor.

=== Battle of the Java Sea ===
On February 24, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; departed as flagship for Admiral Doorman and his flag captain Eugène Lacomblé (who had previously served on board the ship as a lieutenant) for much of what was left of the ABDA fleet, consisting of three light cruisers&quot;, De Ruyter&quot;, &quot;Java&quot; and HMAS &quot;Perth&quot;, the heavy cruisers &quot;Houston&quot; and HMS &quot;Exeter&quot;, and nine destroyers, as ABDA fleet&#x27;s largest effort yet to destroy Japanese troop convoys after a series of blunders and failed attempts. However, this plan immediately had its troubles as on the 26th the force was spotted by a floatplane launched from the heavy cruiser &quot;Nachi&quot;, joined by the heavy cruiser &quot;Haguro&quot;, the light cruisers &quot;Naka&quot; and &quot;Jintsū&quot;, and eleven destroyers.

==== Afternoon battle ====
The force made contact by 18:00 on the 27th, and fired away. &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, along with the other cruisers targeted &quot;Jintsū&quot; at 16,000 yards but failed to hit her with even a single shell. &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; then opened fire at 28,000 yards as they continued to close the range at maximum speed, with &quot;Haguro&quot; focusing her fire on &quot;De Ruyter&quot;. &quot;Houston&quot;, &quot;Exeter&quot;, and &quot;Perth&quot; fired on &quot;Haguro&quot; which was reported to burst into flames and sank, but &quot;Haguro&quot; had not been hit once and in turn drew the actual first blood of the engagement when she hit &quot;De Ruyter&quot; with two 20.3 cm (8 in) shells. The first hit the axillary motor room and started a small fire, killing one crewman and injuring six others, while the second over penetrated unarmored portions of the ship without exploding. Even when they didn&#x27;t hit, &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; shells still straddled &quot;De Ruyter&quot; several times.

Around this time, seven Japanese destroyers fired their torpedoes at the Allied warships, and while no hits were scored &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and the other cruisers rapidly maneuvered to evade them, prompting &quot;Haguro&quot; to switch fire to &quot;Exeter&quot; and score a pair of hits. One was a dud, but the other exploded below the waterline and destroyed six of her eight boilers, cutting her speed to 5 knots and forcing her to withdraw from the battle. From 22,000 yards, &quot;Haguro&quot; then launched a salvo of torpedoes which some 10 minutes later hit the destroyer &quot;Kortenaer&quot;, which blew in half and sank instantly, followed by the destroyer &quot;Asagumo&quot; (possibly joined by &quot;Jintsū&quot;) winning a gunfight with the destroyer HMS &quot;Electra&quot; and sinking her.

==== Allied withdraw ====
With two destroyers sunk and a heavy cruiser crippled, faced by superior ships, and only a single of his ships, the &quot;Electra&quot; (which had just been sunk) making any hits on an enemy ship whatsoever (hits on both &quot;Asagumo&quot; and the destroyer &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; that had caused little critical damage), Admiral Doorman ordered his ships to disengage from the battle and withdraw back to Surabaya. &quot;De Ruyter&quot; turned away from the action as some of Doorman&#x27;s destroyers picked up survivors from &quot;Kortenaer.&quot; With the battle over for the time being, around 20:00, four American destroyers, having expended their torpedoes and most of their ammo, withdrew from the battle. To top things off, tragedy struck when at 21:25, the destroyer HMS &quot;Jupiter&quot; hit a mine that was laid by Dutch forces and sank in a friendly fire incident.

==== De Ruyter&#x27;s loss at the night battle ====
Unknown to Admiral Doorman, &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; floatplane had been trailing the allied force, and the Japanese had been planning an ambush. Just before midnight, &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; closed to 16,000 yards undetected by &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and the other ships and prepared a stealth attack by firing torpedoes only. &quot;Nachi&quot; fired first, putting out eight torpedoes, followed by &quot;Haguro&quot; sending out four. Several minutes later, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; noticed &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; torpedo spread, and quickly turned to evade and was not damaged. The same could not be said for &quot;Java&quot;, which was hit by one of &quot;Nachi&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes that ignited her aft main battery magazines, blowing the cruiser in two and sinking &quot;Java&quot; in under two minutes.

Unfortunately, four minutes after &quot;Java&quot; received her fatal hit, &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was hit by one of &quot;Haguro&#x27;s&quot; four torpedoes, the last time she was damaged by the pesky &quot;Haguro&quot;. &quot;Haguro&quot; and &quot;Nachi&quot; then retreated from the area, depending on the source they were either undetected, or spotted but allied gunfire was ineffective. It was clear that fatal damage had been dealt; while &quot;De Ruyter&quot; didn&#x27;t immediately explode and sink like &quot;Java&quot;, flooding was beginning to overwhelm damage control. Eventually, the abandon ship order was issued, and both Karel Doorman and Captain Lacomblé chose to go down with &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, even allegedly (according to some accounts) retreating to Doorman&#x27;s cabin and together committing suicide for their failure to save the ship. 

&quot;De Ruyter&quot; stayed afloat for some three hours, but eventually sank the next morning at about 02:30, with the loss of 367 men. She did not make a single hit during the course of the battle, and not a single Japanese ship was sunk.

==Wreck==
The wreck of &quot;De Ruyter&quot; was discovered by specialist wreck divers on 1 December 2002 and declared a war grave, with the ship&#x27;s two bells—one now in the Kloosterkerk in the Hague—being recovered. The wreck of was also found on the same day by the same divers, which then found on 12 August 2004.

In 2016, the whole wrecks of &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and &quot;Java&quot;, as well much of &quot;Kortenaer&quot;, were found to have disappeared from the seabed, although their imprints on the ocean floor remained. Over 100 ships and submarines of various countries sank during the war in the seas around Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia; many are designated as war graves. There is known to be illegal scavenging of these wrecks, often using explosives; the Netherlands Defence Ministry suggested that &quot;De Ruyter&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, and &quot;Kortenaer&quot; may have been illegally salvaged. In February 2017, a report was issued confirming the illegal salvaging of the three wrecks.

According to Indonesian journalist Aqwam Hanifan, the remains of Dutch sailors on &quot;De Ruyter&quot; and the other illegally salvaged ships were dumped in a mass grave in East Java.
