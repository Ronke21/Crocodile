<text>St Giles&#x27; Cathedral (), or the High Kirk of Edinburgh, is a parish church of the Church of Scotland in the Old Town of Edinburgh. The current building was begun in the 14th century and extended until the early 16th century; significant alterations were undertaken in the 19th and 20th centuries, including the addition of the Thistle Chapel. St Giles&#x27; is closely associated with many events and figures in Scottish history, including John Knox, who served as the church&#x27;s minister after the Scottish Reformation.

Likely founded in the 12th century and dedicated to Saint Giles, the church was elevated to collegiate status by Pope Paul II in 1467. In 1559, the church became Protestant with John Knox, the foremost figure of the Scottish Reformation, as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles&#x27; was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, such as a prison and as a meeting place for the Parliament of Scotland. In 1633, Charles I made St Giles&#x27; the cathedral of the newly created Diocese of Edinburgh. Charles&#x27; attempt to impose doctrinal changes on the presbyterian Scottish Kirk, including a Prayer Book causing a riot in St Giles&#x27; on 23 July 1637, which precipitated the formation of the Covenanters and the beginnings of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. St Giles&#x27; role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters&#x27; Rebellion has led to its being called &quot;the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism&quot;.
St Giles&#x27; is one of Scotland&#x27;s most important medieval parish church buildings. The first church of St Giles&#x27; was a small Romanesque building of which only fragments remain. In the 14th century, this was replaced by the current building which was enlarged between the late 14th and early 16th centuries. The church was altered between 1829 and 1833 by William Burn and restored between 1872 and 1883 by William Hay with the support of William Chambers. Chambers hoped to make St Giles&#x27; a &quot;Westminster Abbey for Scotland&quot; by enriching the church and adding memorials to notable Scots. Between 1909 and 1911, the Thistle Chapel, designed by Robert Lorimer, was added to the church.

Since the medieval period, St Giles&#x27; has been the site of nationally important events and services; the services of the Order of the Thistle take place there. Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland&#x27;s most popular visitor sites: it attracted over a million visitors in 2018.

==Name and dedication==

Saint Giles is the patron saint of lepers. Though chiefly associated with the Abbey of Saint-Gilles in modern-day France, he was a popular saint in medieval Scotland. The church was first possessed by the monks of the Order of St Lazarus, who ministered among lepers; if David I or Alexander I is the church&#x27;s founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister Matilda, who founded St Giles in the Fields.

Prior to the Reformation, St Giles&#x27; was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as Jean Froissart, refer simply to the &quot;church of Edinburgh&quot;. From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church&#x27;s full title was &quot;the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh&quot;. Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as &quot;the college kirk of Sanct Geill&quot;. The charter of 1633 raising St Giles&#x27; to a cathedral records its common name as &quot;Saint Giles&#x27; Kirk&quot;.

St Giles&#x27; held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1689 during periods of episcopacy within the Church of Scotland. Since 1689, the Church of Scotland, as a Presbyterian church, has had no bishops and, therefore, no cathedrals. St Giles&#x27; is one of a number of former cathedrals in the Church of Scotland – such as Glasgow Cathedral or Dunblane Cathedral – that retain their title despite having lost this status. Since the church&#x27;s initial elevation to cathedral status, the building as a whole has generally been called St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, St Giles&#x27; Kirk or Church, or simply St Giles&#x27;.

The title &quot;High Kirk&quot; is briefly attested during the reign of James VI as referring to the whole building. A 1625 order of the Privy Council of Scotland refers to the Great Kirk congregation, which was then meeting in St Giles&#x27;, as the &quot;High Kirk&quot;. The title fell out of use until reapplied in the late 18th century to the East (or New) Kirk, the most prominent of the four congregations then meeting in the church. Since 1883, the High Kirk congregation has occupied the entire building.

==Location==

The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland identified St Giles&#x27; as &quot;the central focus of the Old Town&quot;. The church occupies a prominent and flat portion of the ridge that leads down from Edinburgh Castle; it sits on the south side of the High Street: the main street of the Old Town and one of the streets that make up the Royal Mile.

From its initial construction in the 12th century until the 14th century, St Giles&#x27; was located near the eastern edge of Edinburgh. By the time of the construction of the King&#x27;s Wall in the mid-15th century, the burgh had expanded and St Giles&#x27; stood near its central point. In the late medieval and early modern periods, St Giles&#x27; was also located at the centre of Edinburgh&#x27;s civic life: the Tolbooth – Edinburgh&#x27;s administrative centre – stood immediately north-west of the church and the Mercat Cross – Edinburgh&#x27;s commercial and symbolic centre – stood immediately north-east of it.

From the construction of the Tolbooth in the late 14th century until the early 19th century, St Giles&#x27; stood in the most constricted point of the High Street with the Luckenbooths and Tolbooth jutting into the High Street immediately north and north-west of the church. A lane known as the Stinkand Style (or Kirk Style) was formed in the narrow space between the Luckenbooths and the north side of the church. In this lane, open stalls known as the Krames were set up between the buttresses of the church.

St Giles&#x27; forms the north side of Parliament Square with the Law Courts on the south side of the square. The area immediately south of the church was originally the kirkyard, which stretched downhill to the Cowgate. For more than 450 years, St Giles&#x27; served as the parish burial ground for the whole of the burgh. At its greatest extent, the burial grounds covered almost 0.5ha. This was closed to burials in 1561 and handed over to the town council in 1566. From the construction of Parliament House in 1639, the former kirkyard was developed and the square formed. The west front of St Giles&#x27; faces the former Midlothian County Buildings across West Parliament Square.

==History==
===Early years===

The foundation of St Giles&#x27; is usually dated to 1124 and attributed to David I. The parish was likely detached from the older parish of St Cuthbert&#x27;s. David raised Edinburgh to the status of a burgh and, during his reign, the church and its lands (St Giles&#x27; Grange) are first attested, being in the possession of monks of the Order of Saint Lazarus. Remnants of the destroyed Romanesque church display similarities to the church at Dalmeny, which was built between 1140 and 1166. St Giles&#x27; was consecrated by David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews on 6 October 1243. As St Giles&#x27; is attested almost a century earlier, this was likely a re-consecration to correct the loss of any record of the original consecration.

In 1322 during the First Scottish War of Independence, troops of Edward II of England despoiled Holyrood Abbey and may have attacked St Giles&#x27; as well. Jean Froissart records that, in 1384, Scottish knights and barons met secretly with French envoys in St Giles&#x27; and, against the wishes of Robert II, planned a raid into the northern counties of England. Though the raid was a success, Richard II of England took retribution on the Scottish borders and Edinburgh in August 1385 and St Giles&#x27; was burned. The scorch marks were reportedly still visible on the pillars of the crossing in the 19th century.

At some point in the 14th century, the 12th century Romanesque St Giles&#x27; was replaced by the current Gothic church. At least the crossing and nave had been built by 1387 as, in that year, Provost Andrew Yichtson and Adam Forrester of Nether Liberton commissioned John Skuyer, John Primrose, and John of Scone to add five chapels to the south side of the nave.

In the 1370s, the Lazarite friars supported the King of England and St Giles&#x27; reverted to the Scottish crown. In 1393, Robert III granted St Giles&#x27; to Scone Abbey in compensation for the expenses incurred by the abbey in 1390 during the King&#x27;s coronation and the funeral of his father. Subsequent records show clerical appointments at St Giles&#x27; were made by the monarch, suggesting the church reverted to the crown soon afterwards.

In 1416, a pair of white stork nested on top of the building.

===Collegiate church===

In 1419, Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas led an unsuccessful petition to Pope Martin V to elevate St Giles&#x27; to collegiate status. Unsuccessful petitions to Rome followed in 1423 and 1429. The burgh launched another petition for collegiate status in 1466, which was granted by Pope Paul II in February 1467. The foundation replaced the role of vicar with a provost accompanied by a curate, sixteen canons, a beadle, a minister of the choir, and four choristers.
During the period of these petitions, William Preston of Gorton had, with the permission of Charles VII of France, brought from France the arm bone of Saint Giles, an important relic. From the mid-1450s, the Preston Aisle was added to the southern side of the choir to commemorate this benefactor; Preston&#x27;s eldest male descendants were given the right to carry the relic at the head of the Saint Giles&#x27; Day procession every 1 September. Around 1460, extension of the chancel and the addition thereto of a clerestory were supported by Mary of Guelders, possibly in memory of her husband, James II.

In the years following St Giles&#x27; elevation to collegiate status, the number of chaplainries and endowments increased greatly and by the Reformation there may have been as many as fifty altars in St Giles&#x27;. In 1470, Pope Paul II further elevated St Giles&#x27; status by granting a petition from James III to exempt the church from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of St Andrews.

During Gavin Douglas&#x27; provostship, St Giles&#x27; was central to Scotland&#x27;s response to national disaster of the Battle of Flodden in 1513. As Edinburgh&#x27;s men were ordered by the town council to defend the city, its women were ordered to gather in St Giles&#x27; to pray for James IV and his army. Requiem Mass for the King and the memorial mass for the dead of the battle were held in St Giles&#x27; and Walter Chepman endowed a chapel of the Crucifixion in the lower part of the kirkyard in the King&#x27;s memory.

In the summer of 1544 during the war known as the Rough Wooing, after an English army had burnt Edinburgh, Regent Arran maintained a garrison of gunners in the tower of the church. New stalls for the choir were made by Robert Fendour and Andrew Mansioun between 1552 and 1554.

The earliest record of Reformed sentiment at St Giles&#x27; is in 1535, when Andrew Johnston, one of the chaplains, was forced to leave Scotland on the grounds of heresy. In October 1555, the town council ceremonially burned English language books, likely Reformers&#x27; texts, outside St Giles&#x27;. The theft from the church of images of the Virgin, St Francis, and the Trinity in 1556 may have been agitation by reformers. In July 1557, the church&#x27;s statue of its patron, Saint Giles, was stolen and, according to John Knox, drowned in the Nor Loch then burned. For use in that year&#x27;s Saint Giles&#x27; Day procession, the statue was replaced by one borrowed from Edinburgh&#x27;s Franciscans; though this was also damaged when Protestants disrupted the event.

===Reformation===

At the beginning of 1559, with the Scottish Reformation gaining ground, the town council hired soldiers to defend St Giles&#x27; from the Reformers; the council also distributed the church&#x27;s treasures among trusted townsmen for safekeeping. At 3 pm on 29 June 1559 the army of the Lords of the Congregation entered Edinburgh unopposed and, that afternoon, John Knox, the foremost figure of the Reformation in Scotland, first preached in St Giles&#x27;. The following week, Knox was elected minister of St Giles&#x27; and, the week after that, the purging of the church&#x27;s Roman Catholic furnishings began.

Mary of Guise (who was then ruling as regent for her daughter Mary) offered Holyrood Abbey as a place of worship for those who wished to remain in the Roman Catholic faith while St Giles&#x27; served Edinburgh&#x27;s Protestants. Mary of Guise also offered the Lords of the Congregation that the parish church of Edinburgh would, after 10 January 1560, remain in whichever confession proved the most popular among the burgh&#x27;s inhabitants. These proposals, however, came to nothing and the Lords of the Congregation signed a truce with the Roman Catholic forces and vacated Edinburgh. Knox, fearing for his life, left the city on 24 July 1559. St Giles&#x27;, however, remained in Protestant hands. Knox&#x27;s deputy, John Willock, continued to preach even as French soldiers disrupted his sermons, and ladders, to be used in the Siege of Leith, were constructed in the church.

The events of the Scottish Reformation thereafter briefly turned in favour of the Roman Catholic party: they retook Edinburgh and the French agent Nicolas de Pellevé, Bishop of Amiens, reconsecrated St Giles&#x27; as a Roman Catholic church on 9 November 1559. After the Treaty of Berwick secured the intervention of Elizabeth I of England on the side of the Reformers, they retook Edinburgh. St Giles&#x27; once again became a Protestant church on 1 April 1560 and Knox returned to Edinburgh on 23 April 1560. The Parliament of Scotland legislated that, from 24 August 1560, the Pope had no authority in Scotland.

Workmen, assisted by sailors from the Port of Leith, took nine days to clear stone altars and monuments from the church. Precious items used in pre-Reformation worship were sold. The church was whitewashed, its pillars painted green, and the Ten Commandments and Lord&#x27;s Prayer painted on the walls. Seating was installed for children and the burgh&#x27;s council and incorporations. A pulpit was also installed, likely at the eastern side of the crossing. In 1561, the kirkyard to the south of the church was closed and most subsequent burials were conducted at Greyfriars Kirkyard.

===Church and crown: 1567–1633===

In 1567, Mary, Queen of Scots was deposed and succeeded by her infant son, James VI, St Giles&#x27; was a focal point of the ensuing Marian civil war. After his assassination in January 1570, the Regent Moray, a leading opponent of Mary, Queen of Scots, was interred within the church; John Knox preached at this event. Edinburgh briefly fell to Mary&#x27;s forces and, in June and July 1572, William Kirkcaldy of Grange stationed soldiers and cannon in the tower. Although his colleague of 9 years John Craig had remained in Edinburgh during these events, Knox, his health failing, had retired to St Andrews. A deputation from Edinburgh recalled him to St Giles&#x27; and there he preached his final sermon on 9 November 1572. Knox died later that month and was buried in the kirkyard in the presence of the Regent Morton.

After the Reformation, parts of St Giles&#x27; were given over to secular purposes. In 1562 and 1563, the western three bays of the church were partitioned off by a wall to serve as an extension to the Tolbooth: it was used, in this capacity, as a meeting place for the burgh&#x27;s criminal courts, the Court of Session, and the Parliament of Scotland. Recalcitrant Roman Catholic clergy (and, later, inveterate sinners) were imprisoned in the room above the north door. The tower was also used as a prison by the end of the 16th century. The Maiden – an early form of guillotine – was stored in the church. The vestry was converted into an office and library for the town clerk and weavers were permitted to set up their looms in the loft.

Around 1581, the interior was partitioned into two meeting houses: the chancel became the East (or Little or New) Kirk and the crossing and the remainder of the nave became the Great (or Old) Kirk. These congregations, along with Trinity College Kirk and the Magdalen Chapel, were served by a joint kirk session. In 1598, the upper storey of the Tolbooth partition was converted into the West (or Tolbooth) Kirk.

During the early majority of James VI, the ministers of St Giles&#x27; – led by Knox&#x27;s successor, James Lawson – formed, in the words of Cameron Lees, &quot;a kind of spiritual conclave with which the state had to reckon before any of its proposals regarding ecclesiastical matters could become law&quot;. During his attendance at the Great Kirk, James was often harangued in the ministers&#x27; sermons and relations between the King and the Reformed clergy deteriorated. In the face of opposition from St Giles&#x27; ministers, James introduced successive laws to establish episcopacy in the Church of Scotland from 1584. Relations reached their nadir after a tumult at St Giles&#x27; on 17 December 1596. The King briefly removed to Linlithgow and the ministers were blamed for inciting the crowd; they fled the city rather than comply with their summons to appear before the King. To weaken the ministers, James made effective, as of April 1598, an order of the town council from 1584 to divide Edinburgh into distinct parishes. In 1620, the Upper Tolbooth congregation vacated St Giles&#x27; for the newly established Greyfriars Kirk.

===Cathedral===

James&#x27; son and successor, Charles I, first visited St Giles&#x27; on 23 June 1633 during his visit to Scotland for his coronation. He arrived at the church unannounced and displaced the reader with clergy who conducted the service according to the rites of the Church of England. On 29 September that year, Charles, responding to a petition from John Spottiswoode, Archbishop of St Andrews, elevated St Giles&#x27; to the status of a cathedral to serve as the seat of the new Bishop of Edinburgh. Work began to remove the internal partition walls and to furnish the interior in the manner of Durham Cathedral.

Work on the church was incomplete when, on 23 July 1637, the replacement in St Giles&#x27; of Knox&#x27;s Book of Common Order by a Scottish version of the Church of England&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer provoked rioting due to the latter&#x27;s perceived similarities to Roman Catholic ritual. Tradition attests that this riot was started when a market trader named Jenny Geddes threw her stool at the dean, James Hannay. In response to the unrest, services at St Giles&#x27; were temporarily suspended.

The events of 23 July 1637 led to the signing of the National Covenant in February 1638, which, in turn, led to the Bishops&#x27; Wars, the first conflict of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. St Giles&#x27; again became a Presbyterian church and the partitions were restored. Before 1643, the Preston Aisle was also fitted out as a permanent meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

In autumn 1641, Charles I attended Presbyterian services in the East Kirk under the supervision of its minister, Alexander Henderson, a leading Covenanter. The King had lost the Bishops&#x27; Wars and had come to Edinburgh because the Treaty of Ripon compelled him to ratify Acts of the Parliament of Scotland passed during the ascendancy of the Covenanters.

After the Covenanters&#x27; loss at the Battle of Dunbar, troops of the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell entered Edinburgh and occupied the East Kirk as a garrison church. General John Lambert and Cromwell himself were among English soldiers who preached in the church and, during the Protectorate, the East Kirk and Tolbooth Kirk were each partitioned in two.

At the Restoration in 1660, the Cromwellian partition was removed from the East Kirk and a new royal loft was installed there. In 1661, the Parliament of Scotland, under Charles II, restored episcopacy and St Giles&#x27; became a cathedral again. At Charles&#x27; orders, the body of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose – a senior supporter of Charles I executed by the Covenanters – was re-interred in St Giles&#x27;. The reintroduction of bishops sparked a new period of rebellion and, in the wake of the Battle of Rullion Green in 1666, Covenanters were imprisoned in the former priests&#x27; prison above the north door, which, by then, had become known as &quot;Haddo&#x27;s Hole&quot; due to the imprisonment there in 1644 of Royalist leader Sir John Gordon, 1st Baronet, of Haddo.

After the Glorious Revolution, the Scottish bishops remained loyal to James VII. On the advice of William Carstares, who later became minister of the High Kirk, William II supported the abolition of bishops in the Church of Scotland and, in 1689, the Parliament of Scotland restored Presbyterian polity. In response, many ministers and congregants left the Church of Scotland, effectively establishing the independent Scottish Episcopal Church. In Edinburgh alone, eleven meeting houses of this secession sprang up, including the congregation that became Old St Paul&#x27;s, which was founded when Alexander Rose, the last Bishop of Edinburgh in the established church, led much of his congregation out of St Giles&#x27;.

===Four churches in one: 1689–1843===
In 1699, the courtroom in the northern half of the Tolbooth partition was converted into the New North (or Haddo&#x27;s Hole) Kirk. At the Union of Scotland and England&#x27;s Parliaments in 1707, the tune &quot;Why Should I Be Sad on my Wedding Day?&quot; rang out from St Giles&#x27; recently installed carillon. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, inhabitants of Edinburgh met in St Giles&#x27; and agreed to surrender the city to the advancing army of Charles Edward Stuart.

From 1758 to 1800, Hugh Blair, a leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment and religious moderate, served as minister of the High Kirk; his sermons were famous throughout Britain and attracted Robert Burns and Samuel Johnson to the church. Blair&#x27;s contemporary, Alexander Webster, was a leading evangelical who, from his pulpit in the Tolbooth Kirk, expounded strict Calvinist doctrine.

At the beginning of the 19th century, the Luckenbooths and Tolbooth, which had enclosed the north side of the church, were demolished along with shops built up around the walls of the church. The exposure of the church&#x27;s exterior revealed its walls were leaning outwards. In 1817, the city council commissioned Archibald Elliot to produce plans for the church&#x27;s restoration. Elliot&#x27;s drastic plans proved controversial and, due to a lack of funds, nothing was done with them.
George IV attended service in the High Kirk during his 1822 visit to Scotland. The publicity of the King&#x27;s visit created impetus to restore the now-dilapidated building. With £20,000 supplied by the city council and the government, William Burn was commissioned to lead the restoration. Burn&#x27;s initial plans were modest, but, under pressure from the authorities, Burn produced something closer to Elliot&#x27;s plans.

Between 1829 and 1833, Burn significantly altered the church: he encased the exterior in ashlar, raised the church&#x27;s roofline and reduced its footprint. He also added north and west doors and moved the internal partitions to create a church in the nave, a church in the choir, and a meeting place for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in the southern portion. Between these, the crossing and north transept formed a large vestibule. Burn also removed internal monuments; the General Assembly&#x27;s meeting place in the Preston Aisle; and the police office and fire engine house, the building&#x27;s last secular spaces.

Burn&#x27;s contemporaries were split between those who congratulated him on creating a cleaner, more stable building and those who regretted what had been lost or altered. In the Victorian era and the first half of the 20th century, Burn&#x27;s work fell far from favour among commentators. Its critics included Robert Louis Stevenson, who stated: &quot;…zealous magistrates and a misguided architect have shorn the design of manhood and left it poor, naked, and pitifully pretentious.&quot; Since the second half of the 20th century, Burn&#x27;s work has been recognised as having secured the church from possible collapse.

The High Kirk returned to the choir in 1831. The Tolbooth Kirk returned to the nave in 1832; when they left for a new church on Castlehill in 1843, the nave was occupied by the Haddo&#x27;s Hole congregation. The General Assembly found its new meeting hall inadequate and met there only once, in 1834; the Old Kirk congregation moved into the space.

===Victorian era===

At the Disruption of 1843, Robert Gordon and James Buchanan, ministers of the High Kirk, left their charges and the established church to join the newly founded Free Church. A significant number of their congregation left with them; as did William King Tweedie, minister of the first charge of the Tolbooth Kirk, and Charles John Brown, minister of Haddo&#x27;s Hole Kirk. The Old Kirk congregation was suppressed in 1860.

At a public meeting in Edinburgh City Chambers on 1 November 1867, William Chambers, publisher and Lord Provost of Edinburgh, first advanced his ambition to remove the internal partitions and restore St Giles&#x27; as a &quot;Westminster Abbey for Scotland&quot;. Chambers commissioned Robert Morham to produce initial plans. Lindsay Mackersy, solicitor and session clerk of the High Kirk, supported Chambers&#x27; work and William Hay was engaged as architect; a management board to supervise the design of new windows and monuments was also created.

The restoration was part of a movement for liturgical beautification in late 19th century Scottish Presbyterianism and many evangelicals feared the restored St Giles&#x27; would more resemble a Roman Catholic church than a Presbyterian one. Nevertheless, the Presbytery of Edinburgh approved plans in March 1870 and the High Kirk was restored between June 1872 and March 1873: the pews and gallery were replaced with stalls and chairs and, for the first time since the Reformation, stained glass and an organ were introduced.

The restoration of the former Old Kirk and the West Kirk began in January 1879. In 1881, the West Kirk vacated St. Giles&#x27;. During the restoration, many human remains were unearthed; these were transported in five large boxes for reinterment in Greyfriars Kirkyard. Although he had managed to view the reunified interior, William Chambers died on 20 May 1883, only three days before John Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen, Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, ceremonially opened the restored church; Chambers&#x27; funeral was held in the church two days after its reopening.

===20th and 21st centuries===

In 1911, George V opened the newly constructed chapel of the knights of the Order of the Thistle at the south east corner of the church.

Though the church had hosted a special service for the Church League for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, Wallace Williamson’s refusal to pray for imprisoned suffragettes led to their supporters disrupting services during late 1913 and early 1914.

Ninety-nine members of the congregation – including the assistant minister, Matthew Marshall – were killed in World War I. In 1917, St Giles&#x27; hosted the lying-in-state and funeral of Elsie Inglis, medical pioneer and member of the congregation.

Ahead of the 1929 reunion of the United Free Church of Scotland and the Church of Scotland, the Church of Scotland (Property and Endowments) Act 1925 transferred ownership of St Giles&#x27; from the City of Edinburgh Council to the Church of Scotland.

The church escaped World War II undamaged. The week after VE Day, the royal family attended a thanksgiving service in St Giles&#x27;. The Albany Aisle at the north west of the church was subsequently adapted to serve as a memorial chapel to the 39 members of the congregation killed in the conflict.

To mark her first visit to Scotland since her coronation, Elizabeth II received the Honours of Scotland at a national service of thanksgiving in St Giles&#x27; on 24 June 1953.

From 1973 to 2013, Gilleasbuig Macmillan served as minister of St Giles&#x27;. During Macmillan&#x27;s incumbency, the church was restored and the interior reoriented around a central communion table, the interior floor was levelled and undercroft space was created by Bernard Feilden.

St Giles&#x27; remains an active parish church as well as hosting concerts, special services, and events. In 2018, St Giles&#x27; was the fourth most popular visitor site in Scotland with over 1.3 million visitors that year.

On 12 September 2022, the coffin of the late Queen Elizabeth II was taken to the cathedral for a service of thanksgiving, having travelled from Balmoral Castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse the previous day. The Queen&#x27;s coffin then lay at rest at the cathedral for 24 hours, guarded constantly by the Royal Company of Archers, allowing the people of Scotland to pay their respects. In the evening, the Queen&#x27;s children; King Charles III, the Princess Royal, the Earl of Inverness and the Earl of Forfar held a vigil at the cathedral, a custom known as the Vigil of the Princes.

On 5 July 2023, the Honours of Scotland were presented to King Charles III in a ceremony held in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral. The ceremony was formally described as a National Service of Thanksgiving and Dedication to mark the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla.

==Architecture==
The first St Giles&#x27; was likely a small, Romanesque building of the 12th century with a rectangular nave and semi-circular apsidal chancel. Before the middle of the 13th century, an aisle was added to the south of the church. Archaeological excavations in the 1980s found the 12th-century church was likely constructed of pink sandstone and grey whinstone. The excavations, found the first church was built on a substantial clay platform created to level the steep slope of the area. This platform was surrounded by a boundary ditch.

By 1385, this building had likely been replaced by the core of the current church: a nave and aisles of five bays, a crossing and transepts, and a choir of four bays. The church was extended in stages between 1387 and 1518. In Richard Fawcett&#x27;s words, this &quot;almost haphazard addition of large numbers of chapels&quot; produced &quot;an extraordinarily complex plan&quot;. The resultant profusion of outer aisles is typical of French medieval church architecture but unusual in Britain.

Apart from the internal partitioning of the church in the wake of the Reformation, few significant alterations were made until the restoration by William Burn in 1829–1833, which included the removal of several bays of the church, the addition of clerestories to the nave and transepts, and the encasement of the church&#x27;s exterior in polished ashlar. The church was significantly restored under William Hay between 1872 and 1883, including the removal of the last internal partitions. In the late 19th century, a number of ground level rooms were added around the periphery of the church. The Thistle Chapel was added to the south-east corner of the church by Robert Lorimer in 1909–11. The most significant subsequent restoration commenced in 1979 under Bernard Feilden and Simpson &amp; Brown: this included the levelling of the floor and the rearrangement of the interior around a central communion table.

The exterior of the church, with the exception of the tower, dates almost entirely from William Burn&#x27;s restoration of 1829–1833 and afterwards. Prior to this restoration, St Giles&#x27; possessed what Richard Fawcett called a &quot;uniquely complex external appearance&quot; as the result of the church&#x27;s numerous extensions; externally, a number of chapels were emphasised by gables.
Following the early 19th-century demolition of the Luckenbooths, Tolbooth, and shops built against St Giles&#x27;, the walls of the church were exposed to be leaning outward by as much as one and a half feet in places. Burn encased the exterior of the building in polished ashlar of gray sandstone from Cullalo in Fife. This layer is tied to the existing walls by iron cramps and varies in width from eight inches (20 centimetres) at the base of the walls to five inches (12.5 centimetres) at the top. Burn co-operated with Robert Reid, the architect of new buildings in Parliament Square, to ensure the exteriors of their buildings would complement each other. Burn significantly altered the profile of the church: he expanded the transepts, created a clerestory in the nave, added new doorways in the west front and north and south transepts, and replicated the cusped cresting from the east end of the church throughout the parapet. Alongside the Thistle Chapel, extensions since the Burn restoration include William Hay&#x27;s additions of 1883: rooms south of the Moray Aisle, east of the south transept, and west of the north transept; in 1891, MacGibbon and Ross added a ladies’ vestry – now the shop – at the east of the north transept.

Burn created a symmetrical western façade by replacing the west window of the Albany Aisle at the northwest corner of the church with a double niche and by moving the west window of the inner south nave aisle to repeat this arrangement in the southern half. The west doorway dates from the Victorian restoration and is by William Hay: the doorway is flanked by niches containing small statues of Scottish monarchs and their consorts (from left to right, Alexander I,  David I, Alexander III, Saint Margaret, Margaret Tudor, Robert the Bruce, James I and James IV) and churchmen (from left to right, Gawin Douglas, John Knox, William Forbes and Alexander Henderson) by John Rhind, who also carved the relief of Saint Giles in the tympanum. The metalwork of the west door is by Skidmore. In 2006, new steps and an access ramp were added to the west door by Morris and Steedman Associates.

In order to improve access to Parliament Square, Burn demolished the westernmost two bays of the outer south nave aisle, including the south porch and door. Burn also removed the western bay from the Holy Blood Aisle at the south of the church and, from the north side of the nave, removed the north porch along with an adjoining bay. The lost porches likely dated from the late-15th century and were matched only by those at St John&#x27;s Kirk, Perth and St Michael&#x27;s Kirk, Linlithgow as the grandest two-storey porches on Scottish medieval churches. Like the porch at Linlithgow, on which they were likely based, the porches at St Giles&#x27; possessed an entry arch below an oriel window. Burn replicated this arrangement in a new doorway at the west of the Moray Aisle.

On visiting the church prior to the Burn restoration, Thomas Rickman wrote: &quot;... a few of the windows have the tracery remaining, but from most of them it has been cut away.&quot; Views of the church before the Burn restoration show intersecting tracery in some of the choir windows and looping patterns in the windows of the Holy Blood Aisle. Burn retained the tracery of the great east window, which had been restored by John Mylne the Younger in the mid-17th century. In the other windows Burn inserted new tracery based on late medieval Scottish examples.

===Tower and crown steeple===

St Giles&#x27; possesses a central tower over its crossing: this arrangement is common in larger Scottish medieval secular churches. The tower was constructed in two stages. The lower section of the tower has lancet openings with Y-shaped tracery on every side. This had likely been completed by 1416, in which year the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; records storks nesting there. The upper stage of the tower has clusters of three cusped lancet openings on each side. The date of this work is uncertain, but it may relate both to fines levied on building works at St Giles&#x27; in 1486 and to rules of 1491 for the master mason and his men. From at least 1590, there was a clock face on the tower and, by 1655, there were three faces. The clock faces were removed in 1911.

St Giles&#x27; crown steeple is one of Edinburgh&#x27;s most famous and distinctive landmarks. Cameron Lees wrote of the steeple: &quot;Edinburgh would not be Edinburgh without it.&quot; Dendrochronological analysis dates the crown steeple to between 1460 and 1467. The steeple is one of two surviving medieval crown steeples in Scotland: the other is at King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen and dates from after 1505. John Hume called St Giles&#x27; crown steeple &quot;a serene reminder of the imperial aspirations of the late Stewart monarchs&quot;. The design, however, is English in origin, being found at St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Newcastle before it was introduced to Scotland at St Giles&#x27;; the medieval St Mary-le-Bow, London, may also have possessed a crown steeple. Another crown steeple existed at St Michael&#x27;s Parish Church, Linlithgow until 1821 and others may have been planned, and possibly begun, at the parish churches of Haddington and Dundee. These other examples are composed only of diagonal flying buttresses springing from the four corners of the tower; whereas the St Giles&#x27; steeple is unique among medieval crown steeples in being composed of eight buttresses: four springing from the corners and four springing from the centre of each side of the tower.

For the arrival into Edinburgh of Anne of Denmark in 1590, 21 weather vanes were added to the crests of the steeple; these were removed prior to 1800 and replacements were installed in 2005. The steeple was repaired by John Mylne the Younger in 1648. Mylne added pinnacles half-way up the crests of the buttresses; he is also largely responsible for the present appearance of the central pinnacle and may have rebuilt the tower&#x27;s traceried parapet. The weathercock atop the central pinnacle was created by Alexander Anderson in 1667; it replaced an earlier weathercock of 1567 by Alexander Honeyman.

===Nave===
The &quot;Buildings of Scotland&quot; series calls the nave &quot;archaeologically the most complicated part of church&quot;. Though the nave dates to the 14th century and is one of the oldest parts of the church, it has been significantly altered and extended since.

The ceiling over the central section of the nave is a tierceron vault in plaster; this was added during William Burn&#x27;s restoration of 1829–1833. Burn also heightened the walls of the central section of the nave by 16 feet (4.8 metres), adding windows to create a clerestory. Burn is usually credited with removing a medieval vaulted ceiling from the nave; however, there is no contemporary record of this and it may have been removed before Burn&#x27;s time. The corbels and shafts leading to the springers of the vaults were added by William Hay in 1882. Burn also removed an attic from above the central section of the nave: this contained several rooms and housed the church&#x27;s bell-ringer. The outline of the nave roof prior to the Burn restoration can be observed on the wall above the western arch of the crossing.

Hay is also responsible for the present arcade. Burn had earlier heightened the medieval arcade and replaced the octagonal 14th century pillars with pillars based on the 15th century example in the Albany Aisle. Hay replaced these pillars with replicas of the octagonal 14th century pillars of the choir. Originally, the south arcade of the nave was lower with a clerestory window above each arch. The lower height of the original arcade is indicated by a fragment of an arch, springing from the south west pier of the crossing. The arches of the clerestory windows, now filled-in, are still visible above the each arch of the arcade on the south side of the nave. The two arches nearest the crossing at the south nave arcade show taller arches, which likely relate to a medieval scheme to heighten the arcade; however, the presence of these blind arches in only two bays suggests the scheme proved abortive.

===North nave aisle and chapels===

The ceiling of the north nave aisle is a rib vault in a similar style to the Albany Aisle: this suggests the north nave aisle dates to the same campaign of building at the turn of the 15th century.

In the first decade of the 15th century, the Albany Aisle was erected as a northward extension of the two westernmost bays of the north nave aisle. The Aisle consists of two bays under a stone rib-vaulted ceiling. The west window of the chapel was blocked up during the Burn restoration of 1829–1833. The north wall of the Aisle contains a semi-circular tomb recess. The ceiling vaults are supported by a bundled pillar that supports a foliate capital and octagonal abacus upon which are the escutcheons of the Aisle&#x27;s donors: Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany and Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas. This is the oldest example of a style of pillar repeated throughout the later additions to St Giles&#x27;. Richard Fawcett describes the repetition of this style of pillar and arcading as providing &quot;some measure of control […] to achieve a measure of architectural unity&quot;. Neither Albany nor Douglas was closely associated with St Giles&#x27; and tradition holds the aisle was donated in penance for their involvement in the death of David Stewart, Duke of Rothesay. In 1882, the floor of the Albany Aisle was paved with Minton tiles, bands of Irish marble, and tiled medallions depicting the arms of Scotland; Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany; and Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas. For the Aisle&#x27;s dedication as a memorial chapel in the wake of the Second World War, the Minton tiles were replaced with Leoch paving stones from Dundee while the heraldic medallions and marble bands were retained.

East of the Albany Aisle, two light-coloured stones below the Black Watch&#x27;s Egyptian Campaign memorial mark the site of the Norman north door. Until its removal at the end of the 18th century, the doorway was the only feature of the 12th century Romanesque church &quot;in situ&quot;. An illustration of 1799 shows the doorway as a highly decorated structure, bearing similarities to doorways at the churches of Dalmeny and Leuchars. A porch stood over the site of the north door until the Burn restoration of 1829–1833. This consisted of a chamber over the doorway accessed from the church by a turnpike stair. The lancet arch of the stairway door now frames the Second Battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers&#x27; Second Boer War memorial. East of the former doorway is a recessed stoup.

Two chapels formerly stood north of the easternmost two bays of the north nave aisle. Only the easternmost of these, the St Eloi Aisle, survived the Burn restoration. Its ceiling is a barrel vault with superficial ribs: this was installed during William Hay&#x27;s restoration of 1881–83 and incorporates a boss from the original vault. The archway between the St Eloi Aisle and the north nave aisle is original to the 15th century construction. The west wall of the St Eloi Aisle contains a Romanesque capital from the original church. It was discovered during the clearance of rubble around the medieval east window of the north transept in 1880 and was reset in its present position. The floor of the St Eloi Aisle is marble with mosaic panels by Minton, depicting the emblem the Incorporation of Hammermen between the symbols of the four evangelists.
===South nave aisles===

The inner and outer south nave aisles were likely begun in the later 15th century around the time of the Preston Aisle, which they strongly resemble. They were likely completed by 1510, when altars of the Holy Trinity, Saint Apollonia, and Saint Thomas were added to the west end of the inner aisle. The current aisles replaced the original south nave aisle and the five chapels by John Primrose, John Skuyer, and John of Perth, named in a contract of 1387. The inner aisle retains its original quadripartite vault; however, the plaster tierceron vault of the outer aisle (known as the Moray Aisle) dates to William Burn&#x27;s restoration. During the Burn restoration, the two westernmost bays of the outer aisle were removed. There remains a prominent gap between the pillars of the missing bays and the 19th century wall. At the west end of the outer aisle, Burn added a new wall with a door and oriel window.
Burn also replaced the window of the inner aisle with a smaller window, centred north of the original in order to accommodate a double niche on the exterior wall. The outline of the original window is still visible in the interior wall.

In 1513, Alexander Lauder of Blyth commissioned an aisle of two bays at the eastern end of the outer south nave aisle: the Holy Blood Aisle is the easternmost and only surviving bay of this aisle. It is named for the Confraternity of the Holy Blood, to whom it was granted upon completion in 1518. The western bay of the Aisle and the pillar separating the two bays were removed during the Burn restoration and the remainder was converted to a heating chamber. The Aisle was restored to ecclesiastical use under William Hay. An elaborate late Gothic tomb recess occupies the south wall of the aisle.

===Crossing and transepts===
The piers of the crossing date to the original building campaign of the 14th century and may be the oldest part of the present church. The piers were likely raised around 1400, at which time the present vault and bell hole were created. The first stages of both transepts were likely completed by 1395, in which year the St John&#x27;s Aisle was added to the north of the north transept.

Initially, the north transept extended no further than the north wall of the aisles and possessed a tunnel-vaulted ceiling at the same height as those in the crossing and aisles. The arches between the transept and north aisles of the choir and nave appear to be 14th century. The St John&#x27;s Chapel, extending north of the line of the aisles, was added in 1395; in its western end was a turnpike stair, which, at the Burn restoration, was re-set in the thick wall between the St Eloi Aisle and the north transept. The remains of St John&#x27;s Chapel are visible in the east wall of the north transept: these include fragments of vaulting and a medieval window, which faces into the Chambers Aisle. The bottom half of this window&#x27;s tracery, as far as its embattled transom, is original; curvilinear tracery was added to the upper half by MacGibbon and Ross in 1889–91. At the Burn restoration, the north transept was heightened and a clerestory and plaster vaulted ceiling inserted. A screen of 1881-83 by William Hay crosses the transept in line with the original north wall, creating a vestibule for the north door. The screen contains sculptures of the patron saints of the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh by John Rhind as well as the arms of William Chambers. The ceiling and open screens within the vestibule were designed by Esmé Gordon and added in 1940. A fragment of medieval blind tracery is visible at the western end of this screen.

Initially, the south transept only extended to the line of the south aisles; it was extended in stages as the Preston, Chepman, and Holy Blood Aisles were added. The original barrel vault remains as far as an awkwardly inserted transverse arch supported on heavy corbels between the inner transept arches: this arch was likely inserted after the creation of the Preston Aisle, when the inner transept arches were expanded accordingly. The transverse arch carries an extension to the lower part of the tower, including a 15th-century traceried window. The south transept was heightened and a clerestory and plaster vaulted ceiling were inserted during the Burn restoration.
===Choir===
The &quot;Buildings of Scotland&quot; series calls the choir the &quot;finest piece of late medieval parish church architecture in Scotland&quot;. The choir dates to two periods of building: one in the 14th century and one in the 15th. The archaeological excavations indicate the choir was extended to almost its current size in a single phase before the mid-15th-century work.

The choir was initially built as a hall church: as such, it was unique in Scotland. The western three bays of the choir date to this initial period of construction. The arcades of these bays are supported by simple, octagonal pillars. In the middle of the 15th century, two bays were added to the east end of the choir and the central section was raised to create a clerestory under a tierceron-vaulted ceiling in stone. The springers of the original vault are still visible above some of the capitals of the choir pillars and the outline of the original roof is visible above the eastern arch of the crossing. A grotesque at the intersection of the central rib of the ceiling and the east wall of the tower may be a fragment of the 12th century church. The two pillars and two demi-pillars constructed during this expansion in the easternmost bays of the choir are similar in type to those in the Albany Aisle.

Of the two pillars added during this extension, the northern one is known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Pillar&quot; as its capital bears the arms of James III on its east face; James II on its west face; Mary of Guelders on its north face; and France on its south face. These arms date the work between the birth of James II in 1453 and the death of Mary of Guelders in 1463; the incomplete tressure in the arms of James II may indicate he was dead when the work commenced, dating it to after 1460. The southern pillar is known as the &quot;Town&#x27;s Pillar&quot;. Its capital bears the arms of William Preston of Gorton on its east face; James Kennedy, Bishop of St Andrews on its west face; Nicholas Otterbourne, Vicar of Edinburgh on its north face; and Edinburgh on its south face. The south respond bears the arms of Thomas Cranstoun, Chief Magistrate of Edinburgh; the north respond bears the arms of Alexander Napier of Merchiston, Provost of Edinburgh. Archaeological excavations in the 1980s found evidence these works and the creation of the Preston Aisle may have been partially spurred by a structural failure of parts of the church due to poor foundations and the need for renovations.
===Choir aisles===
Of the two choir aisles, the north is only two thirds the width of the south aisle, which contained the Lady Chapel prior to the Reformation. Richard Fawcett suggests this indicates that both choir aisles were rebuilt after 1385. In both aisles, the curvature of the spandrels between the ribs gives the effect of a dome in each bay. The ribs appear to serve a structural purpose; however, the lack of any intersection between the lateral and longitudinal cells of each bay means that these vaults are effectively pointed barrel vaults. Having been added as part of the mid-15th century extension, the eastern bays of both aisles contain proper lateral cells. The north wall of the north choir aisle contains a 15th-century tomb recess; in this wall, a grotesque, which may date to the 12th century church, has been re-set. At the east end of the south aisle is a stone staircase added by Bernard Feilden and Simpson &amp; Brown in 1981–82.

The Chambers Aisle stands north of the westernmost bay of the north choir aisle. This chapel was created in 1889–91 by MacGibbon and Ross as a memorial to William Chambers. This Aisle stands on the site of the medieval vestry, which, at the Reformation, was converted to the Town Clerk&#x27;s office before being restored to its original use by William Burn. MacGibbon and Ross removed the wall between the vestry and the church and inserted a new arch and vaulted ceiling, both of which incorporate medieval masonry.

The Preston Aisle stands south of the western three bays of the south choir aisle. It is named for William Preston of Gorton, who donated Saint Giles&#x27; arm-bone to the church; Preston&#x27;s arms recur in the bosses and capitals of the chapel. The town council began the Aisle&#x27;s construction in 1455, undertaking to complete it within seven years; however, the presence in the Aisle of a boss bearing the arms of Lord Hailes, Provost of Edinburgh in the 1480s, suggests construction took significantly longer. The Aisle&#x27;s tierceron vault and pillars are similar to those in the 15th century extension of the choir. The pillars and capitals also bear a strong resemblance to those between the inner and outer south nave aisles.

The Chepman Aisle extends south of the westernmost bay of the Preston Aisle. The Aisle was founded by Walter Chepman; permission for construction was granted in 1507 and consecration took place in 1513. The ceiling of the Aisle is a pointed barrel vault whose central boss depicts an angel bearing Chepman&#x27;s arms impaled with those of his first wife, Mariota Kerkettill. The Aisle was divided into three storeys during the Burn restoration then restored in 1888 under the direction of Robert Rowand Anderson.
==Stained glass==
St Giles&#x27; is glazed with 19th and 20th century stained glass by a diverse array of artists and manufacturers. Between 2001 and 2005, the church&#x27;s stained glass was restored by the Stained Glass Design Partnership of Kilmaurs.

Fragments of the medieval stained glass were discovered in the 1980s: none was obviously pictorial and some may have been grisaille. A pre-Reformation window depicting an elephant and the emblem of the Incorporation of Hammermen survived in the St Eloi Aisle until the 19th century. References to the removal of the stained glass windows after the Reformation are unclear. A scheme of coloured glass was considered as early as 1830: three decades before the first new coloured glass in a Church of Scotland building was installed at Greyfriars Kirk in 1857; however, the plan was rejected by the town council.

===Victorian windows===

By the 1860s, attitudes to stained glass had liberalised within Scottish Presbyterianism and the insertion of new windows was a key component of William Chambers&#x27; plan to restore St Giles&#x27;. The firm of James Ballantine was commissioned to produce a sequence depicting the life of Christ, as suggested by the artists Robert Herdman and Joseph Noel Paton. This sequence commences with a window of 1874 in the north choir aisle and climaxes in the great east window of 1877, depicting the Crucifixion and Ascension.

Other windows by Ballantine &amp; Son are the Prodigal Son window in the south wall of the south nave aisle; the west window of the Albany Aisle, depicting the parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins and the parable of the talents (1876); and the west window of the Preston Aisle, depicting Saint Paul (1881). Ballantine &amp; Son are also responsible for the window of the Holy Blood Aisle, depicting the assassination and funeral of the Regent Moray (1881): this is the only window of the church that depicts events from Scottish history. Andrew Ballantine produced the west window in the south wall of the inner south nave aisle (1886): this depicts scenes from the life of Moses. The subsequent generation of the Ballantine firm, Ballantine &amp; Gardiner, produced windows depicting the first Pentecost (1895) and Saint Peter (1895–1900) in the Preston Aisle; David and Jonathan in the east window of the south side of the outer south nave aisle (1900–01); Joseph in the east window of the south wall of the inner south nave aisle (1898); and, in the windows of the Chambers Aisle, Solomon&#x27;s construction of the Temple (1892) and scenes from the life of John the Baptist (1894).
Multiple generations of the Ballantine firm executed heraldic windows in the oriel window of the outer south nave aisle (1883) and in the clerestory of the choir (1877–92): the latter series depicts the arms of the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh. David Small is responsible for the easternmost window of the north side of the clerestory (1879). Ballantine &amp; Son also produced the window of the Chepman Aisle, showing the arms of notable 17th century Royalists (1888); in the St Eloi Aisle, the Glass Stainers&#x27; Company produced a companion window, showing the arms of notable Covenanters (1895).

Daniel Cottier designed the east window of the north side of the north nave aisle, depicting the Christian virtues (1890). Cottier also designed the great west window, now-replaced, depicting the Prophets (1886). Edward Burne-Jones designed the window in the west wall of the north nave aisle (1886). This was produced by Morris &amp; Co. and shows Joshua and the Israelites in the upper section with Jephthah&#x27;s daughter, Miriam, and Ruth in the lower section. Other stained glass artists of the Victorian era represented in St Giles&#x27; are Burlison &amp; Grylls, who executed the Patriarchs window in the west wall of the inner south nave aisle and Charles Eamer Kempe, who created the west window of the south side of the outer south nave aisle: this depicts biblical writers.

===20th century windows===

Oscar Paterson is responsible for the west window of the north side of the north nave aisle (1906): this shows saints associated with St Giles&#x27;. Karl Parsons designed the west window of the south side of the south choir aisle (1913): this depicts saints associated with Scotland. Douglas Strachan is responsible for the windows of the choir clerestory that depict saints (1932–35) and for the north transept window (1922): this shows Christ walking on water and stilling the Sea of Galilee, alongside golden angels subduing demons that represent the four winds of the earth.

Windows of the later 20th century include a window in the north transept clerestory by William Wilson, depicting Saint Andrew (1954), and the east window of the Albany Aisle, on the theme of John the Divine, designed by Francis Spear and painted by Arthur Pearce (1957). The most significant recent window is the great west window, a memorial to Robert Burns (1985). This was designed by Leifur Breiðfjörð to replace the Cottier window of 1886, the glass of which had failed. A scheme of coloured glass, designed by Christian Shaw, was installed in the south transept behind the organ in 1991.

==Memorials==

There are over a hundred memorials in St. Giles&#x27;; most date from the 19th century onwards.

In the medieval period, the floor of St Giles&#x27; was paved with memorial stones and brasses; these were gradually cleared after the Reformation. At the Burn restoration of 1829–1833, most post-Reformation memorials were destroyed; fragments were removed to Culter Mains and Swanston.

The installation of memorials to notable Scots was an important component of William Chambers&#x27; plans to make St Giles&#x27; the &quot;Westminster Abbey of Scotland&quot;. To this end, a management board was set up in 1880 to supervise the installation of new monuments; it continued in this function until 2000. All the memorials were conserved between 2008 and 2009.

===Ancient memorials===

Medieval tomb recesses survive in the Preston Aisle, Holy Blood Aisle, Albany Aisle, and north choir aisle; alongside these, fragments of memorial stones have been re-incorporated into the east wall of the Preston Aisle: these include a memorial to &quot;Johannes Touris de Innerleith&quot; and a carving of the coat of arms of Edinburgh.

A memorial brass to the Regent Moray is situated on his monument in the Holy Blood Aisle. The plaque depicts female personifications of Justice and Religion flanking the Regent&#x27;s arms and an inscription by George Buchanan. The plaque was inscribed by James Gray on the rear of a fragment of a late 15th century memorial brass: a fibreglass replica of this side of the brass is installed on the opposite wall. The plaque was originally set in a monument of 1570 by Murdoch Walker and John Ryotell: this was destroyed at the Burn restoration but the plaque was saved and reinstated in 1864, when John Stuart, 12th Earl of Moray commissioned David Cousin to design a replica of his ancestor&#x27;s memorial.

A memorial tablet in the basement vestry commemorates John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl, who was buried in the Chepman Aisle in 1579. A plaque commemorating the Napiers of Merchiston is located on the north exterior wall of the choir. This was likely installed on the south side of the church by Archibald Napier, 1st Lord Napier in 1637; it was moved to its present location during the Burn restoration.

=== Victorian and Edwardian memorials===

Most memorials installed between the Burn restoration of 1829–1833 and the Chambers restoration of 1872–83 are now located in the north transept: these include white marble tablets commemorating Major General Robert Henry Dick (died 1846); Patrick Robertson, Lord Robertson (died 1855); and Aglionby Ross Carson (1856). The largest of these memorials is a massive plaque surmounted by an urn designed by David Bryce to commemorate George Lorimer, Dean of Guild and hero of the 1865 Theatre Royal fire (1867).

William Chambers, who funded the restoration of 1872–83, commissioned the memorial plaque to Walter Chepman in the Chepman Aisle (1879): this was designed by William Hay and produced by Francis Skidmore. Chambers himself is commemorated by a large plaque in a red marble frame (1894): located in the Chambers Aisle, this was designed by David MacGibbon with the bronze plaque produced by Hamilton and Inches. William Hay, the architect who oversaw the restoration (died 1888), is commemorated by a plaque in the north transept vestibule with a relief portrait by John Rhind.

The first memorial installed after the Chambers restoration was a brass plaque dedicated to Dean James Hannay, the cleric whose reading of Charles I&#x27;s Scottish Prayer Book in 1637 sparked rioting (1882). In response, and John Stuart Blackie and Robert Halliday Gunning supported a monument to Jenny Geddes, who, according to tradition, threw a stool at Hannay. An 1885 plaque on the floor between south nave aisles now marks the putative spot of Geddes&#x27; action. Other historical figures commemorated by plaques of this period include Agnes Keith, Countess of Moray (1893); Robert Leighton (1883); Gavin Douglas (1883); Alexander Henderson (1883); William Carstares (1884); and John Craig (1883), and James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount Stair (1906).
The largest memorials of this period are the Jacobean-style monuments to James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose in the Chepman Aisle (1888) and to his rival, Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll, in the St Eloi Aisle (1895); both are executed in alabaster and marble and take the form of aedicules in which lie life-size effigies of their dedicatees. The Montrose monument was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson and carved by John and William Birnie Rhind. The Argyll monument, funded by Robert Halliday Gunning, was designed by Sydney Mitchell and carved by Charles McBride.

Other prominent memorials of this period include the Jacobean-style plaque on the south wall of the south choir aisle, commemorating John Inglis, Lord Glencorse and designed by Robert Rowand Anderson (1892); the memorial to Arthur Penrhyn Stanley (died 1881) in the Preston Aisle, including a relief portrait by Mary Grant; and the large bronze relief of Robert Louis Stevenson by Augustus Saint-Gaudens on the west wall of the Moray Aisle (1904). A life-size bronze statue of John Knox by James Pittendrigh MacGillivray (1906) stands in the north nave aisle. This initially stood in a Gothic niche in the east wall of the Albany Aisle; the niche was removed in 1951 and between 1965 and 1983, the statue stood outside the church, in Parliament Square.

===20th and 21st century memorials===

In the north choir aisle, the bronze plaque commemorating Sophia Jex-Blake (died 1912) and the stone plaque to James Nicoll Ogilvie (1928) were designed by Robert Lorimer. Lorimer himself is commemorated by a large stone plaque in the Preston Aisle (1932): this was designed by Alexander Paterson. A number of plaques in the &quot;Writers&#x27; Corner&quot; in the Moray Aisle incorporate relief portraits of their dedicatees: these include memorials to Robert Fergusson (1927) and Margaret Oliphant (1908), sculpted by James Pittendrigh Macgillivray; John Brown (1924), sculpted by Pilkington Jackson; and John Stuart Blackie (died 1895) and Thomas Chalmers (died 1847), designed by Robert Lorimer. Further relief portrait plaques commemorate Robert Inches (1922) in the former session house and William Smith (1929) in the Chambers Aisle; the former was sculpted by Henry Snell Gamley. Pilkington Jackson executed a pair of bronze relief portraits in pedimented Hopton Wood stone frames to commemorate Cameron Lees (1931) and Wallace Williamson (1936): these flank the entrance to the Thistle Chapel in the south choir aisle.
Modern sculptures include the memorial to Wellesley Bailey in the south choir aisle, designed by James Simpson (1987) and Merilyn Smith&#x27;s bronze sculpture of a stool in the south nave aisle, commemorating Jenny Geddes (1992). The most recent memorials are plaques by Kindersley Cardozo Workshop of Cambridge commemorating James Young Simpson (1997) and Ronald Colville, 2nd Baron Clydesmuir (2003) in the Moray Aisle and marking the 500th anniversary of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in the north choir aisle (2005).

===Military memorials===

====Victorian====

Victorian military memorials are concentrated at the west end of the church. The oldest military memorial is John Steell&#x27;s memorial to members of the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot killed by disease in Sindh between 1844 and 1845 (1850): this white marble tablet contains a relief of a mourning woman and is located on the west wall of the nave. Nearby is the second-oldest military memorial, William Brodie&#x27;s Indian Rebellion of 1857 memorial for the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot (1864): this depicts, in white marble, two Highland soldiers flanking a tomb.
John Rhind sculpted the Royal Scots Greys&#x27; Sudan memorial (1886): a large brass Celtic cross on grey marble. John Rhind and William Birnie Rhind sculpted the Highland Light Infantry&#x27;s Second Boer War memorial: a marble-framed brass plaque. William Birnie Rhind and Thomas Duncan Rhind sculpted the Royal Scots 1st Battalion&#x27;s Second Boer War memorial: a bronze relief within a pedimented marble frame (1903); WS Black designed the Royal Scots 3rd Battalion&#x27;s Second Boer War memorial: a portrait marble plaque surmounted by an angel flanked by obelisks.

====World Wars====

The Elsie Inglis memorial in the north choir aisle was designed by Frank Mears and sculpted in rose-tinted French stone and slate by Pilkington Jackson (1922): it depicts the angels of Faith, Hope, and Love. Jackson also executed the Royal Scots 5th Battalion&#x27;s Gallipoli Campaign memorial – bronze with a marble tablet (1921) – and the 16th (McCrae&#x27;s) Battalion&#x27;s First World War memorial, showing Saint Michael and sculpted in Portland stone: this was designed by Robert Lorimer, who also designed the bronze memorial plaque to the Royal Army Medical Corps in the north choir aisle. Individual victims of the war commemorated in St Giles&#x27; include Neil Primrose (1918) and Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet (1917). Ministers and students of the Church of Scotland and United Free Church of Scotland are commemorated by a large oak panel at the east end of the north nave aisle by Messrs Begg and Lorne Campbell (1920).

Henry Snell Gamley is responsible for the congregation&#x27;s First World War memorial (1926): located in the Albany Aisle, this consists of a large bronze relief of an angel crowning the &quot;spirit of a soldier&quot;, its green marble tablet names the 99 members of the congregation killed in the conflict. Gamley is also responsible for the nearby white marble and bronze tablet to Scottish soldiers killed in France (1920); the Royal Scots 9th Battalion&#x27;s white marble memorial in the south nave aisle (1921); and the bronze relief portrait memorial to Edward Maxwell Salvesen in the north choir aisle (1918).

The names of 38 members of the congregation killed in the Second World War are inscribed on tablets designed by Esmé Gordon within a medieval tomb recess in the Albany Aisle: these were unveiled at the dedication of the Albany Aisle as a war memorial chapel in 1951. As part of this memorial, a cross with panels by Elizabeth Dempster was mounted on the east wall of the Aisle. Other notable memorials of the Second World War include Basil Spence&#x27;s large wooden plaque to the 94th (City of Edinburgh) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery (1954) in the north choir aisle and the nearby Church of Scotland chaplains memorial (1950): this depicts Saint Andrew in bronze relief and was manufactured by Charles Henshaw.

==Features==

Prior to the Reformation, St Giles&#x27; was furnished with as many as fifty stone subsidiary altars, each with their own furnishings and plate. The Dean of Guild&#x27;s accounts from the 16th century also indicate the church possessed an Easter sepulchre, sacrament house, rood loft, lectern, pulpit, wooden chandeliers, and choir stalls. On 16 December 1558, the goldsmith James Mosman weighed and valued the treasures of St Giles&#x27; including the reliquary of the saint&#x27;s arm bone with a diamond ring on his finger, a silver cross, and a ship for incense. At the Reformation, the interior was stripped and a new pulpit at the east side of the crossing became the church&#x27;s focal point. Seating was installed for children and the burgh&#x27;s council and trade guilds and a stool of penitence was added. After the Reformation, St Giles&#x27; was gradually partitioned into smaller churches.

At the church&#x27;s restoration by William Hay in 1872–83, the last post-Reformation internal partitions were removed and the church was oriented to face the communion table at the east end; the nave was furnished with chairs and the choir with stalls; a low railing separated the nave from the choir. The &quot;Buildings of Scotland&quot; series described this arrangement as &quot;High Presbyterian (Low Anglican)&quot;. Most of the church&#x27;s furnishings date from this restoration onwards. From 1982, the church was reoriented with seats in the choir and nave facing a central communion table under the crossing.

===Furniture===

====Pulpits, tables, and font====
The pulpit dates to 1883 and was carved in Caen stone and green marble by John Rhind to a design by William Hay. The pulpit is octagonal with relief panels depicting the acts of mercy. An octagonal oak pulpit of 1888 with a tall steepled canopy stands in the Moray Aisle: this was designed by Robert Rowand Anderson. St Giles&#x27; possessed a wooden pulpit prior to the Reformation. In April 1560, this was replaced with a wooden pulpit with two locking doors, likely located at the east side of the crossing; a lectern was also installed. A brass eagle lectern stands on the south side of the crossing: this was given by an anonymous couple for use in the Moray Aisle. The bronze lectern steps were sculpted by Jacqueline Stieger and donated in 1991 by the Normandy Veterans&#x27; Association. Until 1982, a Caen stone lectern, designed by William Hay stood opposite the pulpit at the west end of the choir.

Situated in the crossing, the communion table is a Carrara marble block unveiled in 2011: it was donated by Roger Lindsay and designed by Luke Hughes. This replaced a wooden table in use since 1982. The plain communion table used after the Chambers restoration was donated to the West Parish Church of Stirling in 1910 and replaced by an oak communion table designed by Robert Lorimer and executed by Nathaniel Grieve. The table displays painted carvings of the Lamb of God, Saint Giles, and angels; it was lengthened in 1953 by Scott Morton &amp; Co. and now stands in the Preston Aisle. The Albany Aisle contains a neo-Jacobean communion table by Whytock and Reid, which was installed at the time of the Aisle&#x27;s dedication as a war memorial chapel in 1951. A small communion table with Celtic knot and floral designs was added to the Preston Aisle in 2019; this was designed by Sheanna Ashton and made by Grassmarket Furniture.
The communion table and reredos of the Chambers Aisle were designed by Robert Lorimer and John Fraser Matthew in 1927–29. The reredos contains a relief of the adoration of the infant Christ by angels: this is the work of Morris and Alice Meredith Williams. In 1931, Matthew designed a reredos and communion table for the Moray Aisle; these were removed in 1981 and later sold to the National Museum of Scotland. A reredos in the form of a Gothic arcade stood at the east end of the church from the Chambers restoration; this was designed by William Hay and executed in Caen stone with green marble pillars. In 1953, this was replaced with a fabric reredos, designed by Esmé Gordon. The Gordon reredos was removed in 1971; the east wall is now bare.
The Caen stone font by John Rhind is in the form of a kneeling angel holding a scallop; the font is an exact replica of Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s font for the Church of Our Lady, Copenhagen. Initially, it stood near the pulpit before being moved to the west end of the south nave aisle; between 1916 and 1951, it stood in the Albany Aisle; it was then moved to near the west door and has stood in the north choir aisle since 2015.

====Seating====
Since 2003, new chairs, many of which bear small brass plaques naming donors, have replaced chairs of the 1880s by West and Collier throughout the church. Two banks of choir stalls in a semi-circular arrangement occupy the south transept; these were installed by Whytock &amp; Reid in 1984. Whytock &amp; Reid also provided box pews for the nave in 1985; these have since been removed. In 1552, prior to the Reformation, Andrew Mansioun executed the south bank of choir stalls; the north bank were likely imported. In 1559, at the outset of the Scottish Reformation, these were removed to the Tolbooth for safe-keeping; they may have been re-used to furnish the church after the Reformation.
There has been a royal loft or pew in St Giles&#x27; since the regency of Mary of Guise. Standing between the south choir aisle and Preston Aisle, the current monarch&#x27;s seat possess a tall back and canopy, on which stand the royal arms of Scotland; this oak seat and desk were created in 1953 to designs of Esmé Gordon and incorporate elements of the former royal pew of 1885 by William Hay. Hay&#x27;s royal pew stood in the Preston Aisle; it replaced an oak royal pew of 1873, also designed by Hay and executed by John Taylor &amp; Son: this was re-purposed as an internal west porch and was removed in 2008.

===Metalwork, lighting, and plate===
The gates and railings of the Albany Aisle, the St Eloi Aisle, the Holy Blood Aisle, and the Chepman Aisle are the work of Francis Skidmore and date from the Chambers restoration. Skidmore also produced the chancel railing – now removed – and the iron screens at the east end of the north choir aisle: these originally surrounded the Moray Aisle. The gates and font bracket in the Chambers Aisle are by Thomas Hadden and date from the aisle&#x27;s designation as the Chapel of Youth in 1927–29. The west door is surrounded by a metal and blue glass screen of 2008 by Leifur Breiðfjörð.

The church is lit by stainless steel and aluminium chandeliers as well as by concealed strip lights below the windows. The chandeliers are designed to evoke lilies and were produced between 2007 and 2008 by Lighting Design Partnership near Edinburgh; they replaced a concealed lighting system of 1958. In 1882, during the Chambers restoration, Francis Skidmore provided a set of gas chandeliers based on a chandelier in St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol. Electric lighting was installed in 1911 and Robert Lorimer designed new electric chandeliers; at their removal in 1958, some of these were donated to St John&#x27;s Kirk, Perth and Cleish Church. A red glass &quot;Lamp of Remembrance&quot; by Thomas Hadden hangs in the Albany Aisle: its steel frame imitates St Giles&#x27; crown steeple. A lamp with stained glass panels by Douglas Strachan hangs in the Chambers Aisle.

Plate in possession of the church includes four communion cups dated 1643 and two flagons dated 1618 and given by George Montaigne, then Bishop of Lincoln. Among the church&#x27;s silver are two plates dated 1643 and a ewer dated 1609.

===Clocks and bells===

The current clock was manufactured by James Ritchie &amp; Son and installed in 1911; this replaced a clock of 1721 by Langley Bradley of London, which is now housed in the Museum of Edinburgh. A clock is recorded in 1491. Between 1585 and 1721, the former clock of Lindores Abbey was used in St Giles&#x27;.
The hour bell of the cathedral was cast in 1846 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, possibly from the metal of the medieval Great Bell, which had been taken down about 1774. The Great Bell was cast in Flanders in 1460 by John and William Hoerhen and bore the arms of Guelderland and an image of the Virgin and Child. Robert Maxwell cast the second bell in 1706 and the third in 1728: these chime the quarters, the latter bears the coat of arms of Edinburgh. Between 1700 and 1890, a carillon of 23 bells, manufactured in 1698 and 1699 by John Meikle, hung in the tower. Daniel Defoe, who visited Edinburgh in 1727, praised the bells but added &quot;they are heard much better at a distance than near at hand&quot;. In 1955, an anonymous elder donated one of the carillon&#x27;s bells: it hangs in a Gothic wooden frame next to the Chambers Aisle. Nearby hangs the bell of : this was presented in 1955 by the Admiralty to mark the ship&#x27;s connection to Edinburgh. The bell hangs in a frame topped by a naval crown: this was made from &quot;Howe&quot;″s deck timbers. The vesper bell of 1464 stands in the south nave aisle.

===Flags and heraldry===

From 1883, regimental colours were hung in the nave. In 1982, the Scottish Command of the British Army offered to catalogue and preserve the colours. The colours were removed from the nave and 29 were reinstated in the Moray Aisle. Since 1953, the banners of the current knights of the Thistle have hung in the Preston Aisle, near the entrance to the Thistle Chapel. The banner of Douglas Haig hangs in the Chambers Aisle; this was donated in 1928 by Lady Haig after her husband&#x27;s lying-in-state in St Giles&#x27;. A large wooden panel, showing the arms of George II hangs on the tower wall above at the west end of the choir: this is dated 1736 and was painted by Roderick Chalmers.

The Fetternear Banner, the only surviving religious banner from pre-Reformation Scotland, was made around 1520 for the Confraternity of the Holy Blood, which had its altar in the Lauder Aisle. The banner, which depicts the wounded Christ and the instruments of His passion, is held by the National Museum of Scotland.

===National Covenant===
St Giles&#x27; possesses one of the original copies of Scotland&#x27;s National Covenant of 1638. The copy in St Giles&#x27; was signed by leading Covenanters, including James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose; John Leslie, 6th Earl of Rothes; and John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis. The Covenant remained in the possession of the family of the Laird of Dundas until 1924, when it was purchased by Alexander Wallace and donated to St Giles&#x27; in 1926. It now stands in a plain oak frame in the Chepman Aisle.

==Thistle Chapel==
Located at the south-east corner of St Giles&#x27;, the Thistle Chapel is the chapel of the Order of the Thistle; it is accessed externally by the east door of the church and from the church itself by the south choir aisle.

At the foundation of the Order of the Thistle in 1687, James VII ordered Holyrood Abbey be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At James&#x27; deposition the following year, a mob destroyed the chapel&#x27;s interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles&#x27; Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven donated £24,000 from their late father&#x27;s estate, Edward VII ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles&#x27;.

The Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the chapel&#x27;s construction appointed Robert Lorimer as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish Arts and Crafts movement, including Phoebe Anna Traquair for enamelwork, Douglas Strachan for stained glass, Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. Louis Davis – who supplied stained glass – and the Bromsgrove Guild – who supplied bronze fittings – were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, George V knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, crests, and banners for new knights and ladies, the chapel&#x27;s tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The knights and ladies of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.

Architectural critics have noted Lorimer&#x27;s successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of Gothic architecture, rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the chapel&#x27;s importance as a product of the Arts and Crafts movement, in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the chapel&#x27;s political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, British imperialism, and monarchism.

==Worship==
===Services and liturgy===
St Giles&#x27; holds three services every Sunday:

* 9.30 a.m.: Morning Service – Choir, Sermon, Holy Communion
* 11.00 a.m.: Morning Service – Choir, Sermon
* 6 p.m.: St Giles&#x27; At Six – Programme of Music
Every weekday a service is held at 12 noon. Sunday morning service is also live-streamed from the St Giles&#x27; Cathedral YouTube channel.

Prior to the Reformation, St Giles&#x27; used the Sarum Use, with High Mass being celebrated at the high altar and Low Mass celebrated at the subsidiary altars. After the Reformation, services were conducted according to the Book of Common Order; unaccompanied congregation singing of the Psalms replaced choral and organ music and preaching replaced the Mass as the central focus of worship; public penance was also introduced. Communion services were initially held three times a year; the congregation sat around trestle tables: a practice that continued until the 1870s. The attempted replacement of the Book of Common Order by a Scottish version of the Book of Common Prayer on 23 July 1637 sparked rioting, which led to the signing of the National Covenant. From 1646, the Directory for Public Worship was used. During the Commonwealth, the Directory fell out of use; public penance, psalm-singing, and Bible readings were removed from the service and lay preaching was introduced. Between 1648 and 1655, the ministers withheld communion in protest. During the second imposition of episcopacy under Charles II and James VII the liturgy reverted to its post-Reformation form and there was no attempt to bring it into line with the practice of the Church of England. By the beginning of the 18th century, the services of the Book of Common Order had been replaced by extempore prayers.

Cameron Lees, minister between 1877 and 1911, was a leading figure in the liturgical revival among Scottish Presbyterian churches in the latter half of the 19th century. Lees used the Church Service Society&#x27;s &quot;Euchologion&quot; for communion services and compiled the &quot;St Giles&#x27; Book of Common Order&quot;: this directed daily and Sunday services between 1884 and 1926. Under Lees, Christmas, Easter, and Watchnight services were introduced. With financial support from John Ritchie Findlay, daily service was also introduced for the first time since the Commonwealth. Lees&#x27; successor, Andrew Wallace Williamson continued this revival and revised the &quot;St Giles&#x27; Book of Common Order&quot;. A weekly communion service was introduced by Williamson&#x27;s successor, Charles Warr. The current pattern of four Sunday services, including two communions, was adopted in 1983 during the incumbency of Gilleasbuig Macmillan. Macmillan introduced a number of changes to communion services, including the practice of communicants&#x27; gathering round the central communion table and passing elements to each other.

===Notable services===

Since the medieval period, St Giles&#x27; has hosted regular and occasional services of civic and national significance. Important annual services held in St Giles include the Edinburgh&#x27;s civic Remembrance Sunday service, the Kirking of the council for the city council, the Kirking of the Courts for the legal profession, the Thistle Service for the Knights of the Thistle; and a service during the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. The Kirking of the Parliament has been held in St Giles&#x27; at the opening of every new session of the Scottish Parliament since the Parliament&#x27;s foundation in 1999; this revives an earlier service for the Parliament of Scotland.

St Giles&#x27; has also long enjoyed a close connection with the Scottish, then British royal families; the royal Knights of Thistle, including the Queen as Sovereign of the Order, attend the Thistle service in St Giles&#x27; every second year. Since the regency of Mary of Guise, there has been a royal pew or loft in St Giles&#x27;. Notable services for the royal family include the Requiem Mass for James I (1437); the service to welcome Anne of Denmark to Scotland (1590); divine service during the visit of George IV (1822); and Elizabeth II&#x27;s receipt of the Honours of Scotland (1953).

Significant occasional services in St Giles&#x27; include the memorial Mass for the dead of Flodden (1513); thanksgivings for the Scottish Reformation (1560), the Union (1707), and Victory in Europe Day (1945); and the service to mark the opening of the first Edinburgh International Festival (1947). Recent occasional services have marked the return to Scotland of the Stone of Scone (1996) and the opening of the National Museum of Scotland (1998); a service of reconciliation after the 2014 Scottish independence referendum was also held in St Giles&#x27;.

St Giles&#x27; hosted the lyings-in-state of Elsie Inglis (1917) and Douglas Haig (1928). Notable recent funerals include those of Robin Cook (2005) and John Bellany (2013). Notable recent weddings include the marriage of Chris Hoy to Sarra Kemp (2010).

===Choir===
St Giles&#x27; Cathedral Choir is a mixed choir of 30 adults, directed by the Master of Music, Michael Harris. The Choir sings at the 10 am Communion and 11.30 am morning services on Sundays. The Choir first toured internationally, to the US, in 2004 and has since toured frequently in Europe and North America. The Choir has also appeared in television and radio broadcasts, including &quot;Choral Evensong&quot;, and has released recordings on its own label, &quot;Aegidius&quot;.

The current Choir was founded in 1879. This revived a tradition of choral music at St Giles&#x27;: until the Reformation, a song school was attached to St Giles&#x27; where four official choristers were educated alongside other boys. The song school fell into disrepair after the departure of its master, John Fethy, in 1551; however, Edward Henderson oversaw its restoration in the years immediately preceding the Reformation. After the Reformation, Henderson continued to teach music there as well as leading the unaccompanied congregational singing of psalms.

===Pipe organ===

The pipe organ was completed in 1992 and is located in the south transept: it was made by Rieger Orgelbau and donated by Alastair Salvesen. Douglas Laird designed the case: it imitates the prow of a ship and uses red-stained Austrian oak along with decorative bronze and glass features. The organ has 4,156 pipes, most of which are tin. The Glocken is a ring of 37 bells made by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry.

The current organ replaced a Harrison &amp; Harrison organ of 1878, the first organ in the church since the Reformation. This organ initially possessed 2 manuals and 26 stops. Between 1872 and this organ&#x27;s installation, a harmonium was used in services. Harrison &amp; Harrison rebuilt the organ in 1883 and 1887. Eustace Ingram rebuilt the organ as a 4 manual, 60 stop instrument in 1895. Ingram &amp; Co rebuilt the organ in 1909 and overhauled it between 1936 and 1939. The organ was reconstructed in 1940 by Henry Willis &amp; Sons as a 4 manual, 74 stop instrument with a new console and an extra console in the Moray Aisle; a new case was designed by Esmé Gordon: this incorporated statues of angels and Jubal by Elizabeth Dempster. The second console was removed in 1980 and Willis overhauled the organ in 1982. The organ was removed in 1990, some of the pipes were removed to the McEwan Hall, Peebles Old Parish Church, and the Scottish Theatre Organ Preservation Trust; two were incorporated in the replacement organ; the console was donated to a church in Perth.

Since 1996, Michael Harris has served as organist and Master of Music; he is assisted by Jordan English. Since the insertion of the first post-Reformation organ in 1878, the following people have served as organist of St Giles&#x27;:

* 1878–1923: John Hartley
* 1923–1944: Wilfrid Greenhouse Allt
* 1946–1996: Herrick Bunney
* 1996–present: Michael Harris
==Ministry==
===Clergy===

The current minister of St Giles&#x27; is Calum MacLeod, who was translated from Fourth Presbyterian Church, Chicago in 2014; he replaced Gilleasbuig Macmillan, who was appointed minister in 1973 and retired in 2013. The assistant minister is Craig Meek. From Cameron Lees to Gilleasbuig Macmillan, every minister of St Giles&#x27; served as Dean of the Thistle; Lees and his two successors, Andrew Wallace Williamson and Charles Warr, also served as Dean of the Chapel Royal in Scotland. In 1980, Helen Alexander was appointed assistant minister, becoming the first woman to minister in St Giles&#x27;. Alongside the minister, St Giles&#x27; has a Kirk Session of around 50 elders.

The first vicar of St Giles&#x27; recorded by name is John, who appended his name to a charter of Holyrood Abbey in 1241. Three successive vicars of St Giles&#x27; in the 15th century – John Methven, Nicholas Otterbourne, and Thomas Bully – were noted churchmen who also held senior positions in the Scottish royal court. In 1467, a bull of Pope Paul II made St Giles&#x27; a collegiate church and replaced the role of vicar with a provost accompanied by a curate and sixteen canons. William Forbes, the last vicar of St Giles&#x27; was promoted as its first provost. Forbes was succeeded by Gavin Douglas, who completed his Middle Scots translation of Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, &quot;Eneados&quot;, in 1513 while provost.

In 1559, John Knox, leader of the Scottish Reformation became the first Protestant minister of St Giles&#x27;, serving intermittently until his death in 1572. Knox&#x27;s successors were influential in opposing the religious reforms of James VI. Though St Giles&#x27; had been partitioned into smaller churches, ministers were only allocated to specific churches after the division of Edinburgh into parishes in 1598. Between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1689, St Giles&#x27; served as the seat of the bishop of Edinburgh and was served by a dean and prebendaries. Notable ministers in St Giles&#x27; during the 18th century include the influential Covenanter and Whig, William Carstares; the evangelical preacher, Alexander Webster; and Hugh Blair, a leading figure of the Scottish Enlightenment.

===Parish and historic congregations===
The current parish of St Giles&#x27; (or the High Kirk) covers a portion of Edinburgh&#x27;s Old Town bounded by the railway, George IV Bridge, the Cowgate, and St Mary&#x27;s Street. Between 1641 and 1929, the High Kirk&#x27;s parish covered the north side of the High Street. From the medieval period until 1598, St Giles&#x27; parish covered the entire burgh of Edinburgh. Prior to the Reformation, St Giles&#x27; was within the Deanery of Linlithgow in the Archdiocese of St Andrews.
Between 1561 and 1564, the west of the nave was partitioned: the upper floor served as a place of worship and the ground floor served as an extension to the Tolbooth. Around 1581, the choir was partitioned off to create the New or East Kirk, leaving the crossing, transepts, and the remainder of the nave to form Middle St Giles&#x27; or the Old or Great Kirk. Edinburgh&#x27;s ministers alternated freely between these churches until 1598, when the Privy Council of Scotland ordered the following division of Edinburgh into four parishes, each with two ministers:

* North East: Trinity College Kirk
* South East: Old (or Great) St Giles&#x27;
* South West: Upper Tolbooth (St Giles&#x27;)
* North West: New (or East or Little) St Giles&#x27;
In 1620, the South West congregation moved to the newly built Greyfriars Kirk; the Upper Tolbooth partition remained unoccupied until 1634. In 1625, the Privy Council ordered the following rearrangement of these divisions; it is not, however, clear whether this was ever enforced:

* North East: Trinity College Kirk
* South East: East (or New) St Giles&#x27;
* South West: Greyfriars Kirk
* North West: Great (or Old) St Giles&#x27;
In 1633, St Giles&#x27; became a cathedral and the partition between the Old and New Kirks was removed, the South East congregation moved to Upper Tolbooth, then occupied the Old Kirk between 1639 and 1647, when it moved to the Tron Kirk; during this period, the Old Kirk congregation occupied Parliament Hall. In 1641, a division of Edinburgh into six parishes was made; the following parishes were allocated to St Giles&#x27;: 
* North: New (or High or East) St Giles&#x27;
* North West: Tolbooth (or West) St Giles&#x27;
* South: Old (or Middle) St Giles&#x27;
In 1699, the congregation of the New North Meeting House on the Lawnmarket occupied the northern half of the Tolbooth partition, after which it was named &quot;Haddo&#x27;s Hole Kirk&quot;. The Tolbooth Kirk vacated St Giles&#x27; in 1843; the Old Kirk was suppressed in 1860 and the Haddo&#x27;s Hole congregation – by then known as West St Giles&#x27; – vacated St Giles&#x27; in 1881 to allow the removal of the internal partitions. Since 1883, the High Kirk congregation has occupied the entire church.

==Cultural depictions==

The real-life escape of condemned smuggler, George Robertson, from the Tolbooth Kirk during divine service in 1736 is fictionalised in &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; by Walter Scott (1818).

St Giles&#x27; is referenced twice in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; by Muriel Spark (1961): first as a location the title character and her &quot;set&quot; of pupils pass by on a walk around Edinburgh and again as one of the &quot;emblems of a dark and terrible salvation&quot; contemplated by the protagonist, Sandy Stranger.

In &quot;Disorderly Knights&quot; (1966), the fourth book of Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s Lymond Chronicles series, the protagonist, Sir Francis Crawford of Lymond, swears an oath in the Lauder Aisle of St Giles&#x27; and duels with Sir Graham Reid Malett on the steps of the church&#x27;s high altar.

In &quot;&quot; (2018), St Giles&#x27; features as one of the locations of a fight between the heroes and Thanos&#x27; Black Order. The scenes were filmed around the cathedral in spring 2017.

<doc id="564526" wikidata="Q137746" url="?curid=564526" title="Cha chaan teng">
<text>Cha chaan teng (), often called a Hong Kong-style cafe or diner in English, is a type of restaurant that originated in Hong Kong. &quot;Cha chaan tengs&quot; are commonly found in Hong Kong, Macau, and parts of Guangdong. Due to the waves of mass migrations from Hong Kong in the 1980s, they are now established in major Chinese communities in Western countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Likened to a greasy spoon cafe or an American diner, &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;s are known for eclectic and affordable menus, which include dishes from Hong Kong cuisine and Hong Kong-style Western cuisine. They draw comparisons to Western cafés due to their casual settings, as well as menus revolving around coffee and tea.

==History==
Since the 1850s, Western cuisine in Hong Kong had been available only in full-service restaurants—a privilege limited for the upper class, and financially out of reach for most working-class locals. In the 1920s, dining in a Western restaurant could cost up to $10, while a working local earned $15 to $50 per month. 

After the Second World War, Hong Kong culture was influenced by British culture, with locals beginning to add milk to tea and eating cakes. Some Hongkongers set up &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; that targeted a local audience. Providing different kinds of Canto-Western cuisine and drinks with very low prices led to them being regarded as &quot;cheap Western food&quot;, or &quot;soy sauce Western food&quot; (豉油西餐).

In the 1950s and 60s, &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; sprang up as rising lower class incomes made such &quot;Western food&quot; affordable, causing &quot;soy sauce western restaurants&quot; and &quot;bing sutt&quot; (冰室, &quot;ice rooms&quot;) to turn into &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; to satisfy the high demand of affordable and fast Hong Kong-style Western food.

In recent years, the management of &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; has adapted to developments in the Hong Kong economy and society. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;s became much more popular in Hong Kong as they still provided the cheapest food for the public. 

Before 2007, most &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; allowed people to smoke, and some waiters would even smoke when working. Since 1 January 2007, Hong Kong law prohibits smoking within the indoor premises of restaurants.

In April 2007, one of the Hong Kong political officers suggested that &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; be listed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, because of its important role in Hong Kong society. On 19 December 2007, lawmaker Choy So Yuk proposed, during a legislative council session, that Hong Kong&#x27;s cha chaan teng be recognised and put up to UNESCO as an &quot;intangible cultural heritage of humanity&quot;. The proposal came about after a Hong Kong poll found that seven out of ten people believed the cafes deserved a UNESCO cultural listing. However, despite these proposals, cha chaan teng was not added to UNESCO&#x27;s lists. 

In June 2014, a number of well-known dishes at &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot;—namely milk tea, &quot;yuenyeung&quot;, pineapple bun, and egg tart—were enlisted into the first Intangible Cultural Heritage Inventory of Hong Kong.

==Name and description==
The name, literally &quot;tea restaurant&quot;, serves to distinguish the restaurants from Western restaurants that provide water to customers instead of tea. &quot;Cha chaan teng&quot; establishments provide tea (usually weak tea) called &quot;clear tea&quot; (清茶 cing1 caa4) to customers as soon as they are seated. Some patrons use this hot tea to wash their utensils, a common custom in Hong Kong. The &quot;tea&quot; in the name refers to inexpensive black tea, which differs from the traditional Chinese tea served in traditional dim sum restaurants and teahouses (茶樓).

The &quot;tea&quot; may also refer to tea drinks, such as the Hong Kong-style milk tea and iced lemon tea, which are served in many &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot;. The older generations in Hong Kong refer to dining in these restaurants as &quot;yum sai cha&quot; (飲西茶; lit: &quot;drinking Western tea&quot;), in contrast to going &quot;yum cha&quot;.

Some &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; adopt the word &quot;café&quot; in their names. This is especially the case when located in English-speaking countries where they are commonly known as &quot;Hong Kong-style cafes&quot; and are instead best known for their serving of &quot;yuenyeung&quot; and Hong Kong-style (condensed milk) coffee.

==Culture==
===Fast service and high efficiency===
Usually, tea restaurants have high customer turnover, at 10–20 minutes for a sitting. Customers typically receive their dishes after five minutes. The waiters take the order with their left hand and pass the dishes with their right hand. This is said to embody Hong Kong&#x27;s hectic lifestyle. During peak periods, long queues form outside many restaurants.

===Long working hours===
The staff in a &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; work long hours, sometimes also night shifts.

===Trend===
Because of the limited land and expensive rent, &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;s are gradually being replaced by chain restaurants, such as Café de Coral, Maxim&#x27;s, and Fairwood. As chain restaurants dominate the market, Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; culture is disappearing. They are, however, increasing in popularity overseas, with many opening up in Cantonese diaspora communities as a casual alternative to more traditional Chinese restaurants.

=== Common phrases and abbreviations ===
To speed up the ordering process, waiters use a range of shorthands when writing down orders (essentially, a Cantonese equivalent to the phenomenon of American diner lingo).
* The character (spoken as &quot;&quot;, meaning &#x27;opposite&#x27;) is used to represent (, meaning &#x27;white rice&#x27;).
* &quot;0T&quot; stands for lemon tea (0 reads as &quot;,&quot; which is phonetically similar to the first word of lemon (, ) and phonetically identical to how most Hong Kong people now pronounce the word (&quot;&quot;) as a result of lazy sounds. &quot;T&quot; stands for &quot;tea&quot;).

Customers similarly use special phrases when ordering:
* (, ) or (, ) ― To order cold drinks without ice
* (, ) ― To have the drink prepared without sugar or milk, when ordering coffee or tea; &#x27;sand&#x27; meaning coarse sugar or powdered sugar
* ( ) ― Hong Kong-style milk tea without sugar; condensed milk is used to replace evaporated milk for sweetness instead
* (, ) ― For extra rice or noodles in a dish, typically costs extra
* (, ) ― For rice or noodles in a dish to be stir-fried

==Menus==

A &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; serves a wide range of food, from steak to wonton noodles to curry to sandwiches, e.g. Hong Kong-style French toast. Both fast food and à-la-carte dishes are available. A larger &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; often consists of three cooking places: a &quot;water bar&quot; (水吧) which makes drinks, toast/sandwiches, and instant noodles; a &quot;noodle stall&quot; which prepares Chiuchow-style noodles (including wonton noodles); and a kitchen for producing rice plates and other more expensive dishes.

==Food and drinks==

Drinks

The invention of drinks like &quot;yuenyeung&quot; (鴛鴦), iced tea with lemon (凍檸茶), and Coca-Cola with lemon (檸樂) is often credited culturally to &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot;.

*Coffee: Two types exist, instant and in powder form, the latter being more common. Often served with condensed milk, especially overseas.
*Black coffee: Hongkongers usually called this &quot;jaai fea&quot; (lit. &quot;vegetarian coffee&quot; / &quot;just coffee&quot;, emphasising its plain texture) or &quot;fei sha jaau naai&quot; (lit. &quot;get rid of sand and milk&quot;, i.e. coffee without sugar (the &quot;sand&quot;) and milk)
*Hong Kong-style milk tea: A highly popular drink in Hong Kong. Its standard is judged by its aroma, smoothness, and concentration. The tea is soaked in an iron container for several hours to let the flavour come out. If the customer wants condensed milk instead of normal milk, people will often say &quot;caa zau&quot; (lit. &quot;tea go&quot;) 
*Sweet soy milk (豆漿): Soy milk sweetened with cane sugar and served either hot or cold.
*Yuenyeung: A mixture of coffee and tea, originated in Hong Kong. According to traditional Chinese medicine, coffee and tea are &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; in nature, respectively. A mixing of both thus then yields the best combination for the beverage.
*Black and white Yuenyeung: A mixture of Ovaltine and Horlicks, originated in Hong Kong.

Snacks

*Toast: This includes toast with condensed milk and butter/peanut butter, toast with jam and butter, toast with butter in a sliced form, and Hong Kong-style French toast
*Sandwich: Sandwiches found in &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; usually include egg, ham, corned beef, Spam (or other luncheon meat), or a mixture of any as a filling. Club sandwiches are also very common. A difference between the sandwiches found in &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; and other eateries is that only white bread is used. The customer has the option of omitting the crust of the bread, and requesting that the bread be toasted before making their sandwich.

==Set meals==
A feature found in &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; is set meals. There are various sets available throughout the day for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. The lunch and dinner sets usually include a soup and a drink. Generally, there is an additional HK$2–3 charge for cold drinks. Sometimes, an additional HK$5 is charged for toasting the bread (烘底).

Other sets include:

* &quot;Nutritious set&quot; (營養餐) – Comes with milk and other nutritional food
* &quot;Constant set&quot; (常餐) – Offered all day long, hence the name (it usually consists of a main course, omelette, wheat foodstuff, white bread with butter, and a drink). The wheat foodstuff comes with different choices such as spiced pork cubes, salted vegetable with sliced pork, or luncheon meat.
* &quot;Fast set&quot; (快餐) – Immediately served (usually rice with sausages/ ham/ fried eggs with gravy)
* &quot;Special set&quot; (特餐) – Chef&#x27;s (or Boss&#x27;s) recommendation

==Tables and seats==
Generally, the tables in &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; are square for four people, or round for six to eight people. For each table, there is a piece of glass that covers the top and some menus are placed between the table and glass. During lunch or dinner, customers are sometimes requested to &quot;daap toi&quot; (搭枱), meaning they share a table with other customers who were already seated before. This helps save space, provide waiting guests with seats faster, and give customers in a hurry a seat.

== Interiors and utensils ==
Much of the plastic-ware found on the table is provided by beverage companies as a form of advertising. This plastic-ware includes containers holding toothpicks, plastic menu holders, etc. Brands like Ovaltine, Horlicks, and Ribena are the usual providers. To minimise costs, &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; also rarely have utensils that bear their own brand name. As a result, the same utensils can be found in many different &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot;, even different chains. These utensils can be bought in supermarkets, department stores, and stores specializing in restaurant supplies.

Walls and floors in &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;s are often tiled because they are easier to clean (especially in Hong Kong&#x27;s humid summer weather). In overseas communities, these restaurants are famous for stocking Chinese newspapers and having LCD televisions on the wall, broadcasting Hong Kong news services.

==Variations==
Other kinds of local restaurants related to &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; in Hong Kong include &quot;chaan sutt&quot; (餐室; lit. &quot;meal chamber&quot;), &quot;bing sutt&quot; (冰室; lit. &quot;ice chamber&quot;), and &quot;bing teng&quot; (冰廳; lit. &quot;ice dining room&quot;), which provide a lighter and more limited selection of food than &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;.

In the old days, these eateries only sold different types of &quot;ice&quot;, sandwiches, and pasta but &quot;no&quot; rice plates. However, some of the restaurants bearing these titles today ignore the tradition, and provide all kinds of rice plates and even wonton noodles. Original &quot;chaan sutts&quot;, &quot;bing sutts,&quot; and &quot;bing tengs&quot;, which can be regarded as the prototype of &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot;, are now scarce in Hong Kong.

In June 2009, Hong Kong retail design store G.O.D. collaborated with Starbucks and created a store with a &quot;Bing Sutt Corner&quot; at their store on Duddell Street. It is a concept that fuses the retro Hong Kong teahouse style with the contemporary look of a coffeehouse.
=== Buffet ===
Some &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; have moved to a buffet style of service. &quot;Fei Du Du Cha Chaan Teng&quot;, owned by Stephen Cheng in Tsuen Wan, was the first known &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; to move to a buffet style, on 1 March 2013. The idea originated when Cheng, facing high rent, decided to try a new method to run his business to compete with the high inflation rate. With reported success, several other restaurants also switched to buffet style.

Customer reception seemed generally positive, as prices decreased. One customer from Sham Shui Po said the meal was almost 70% cheaper than the food served in the industrial regions nearby.

==In media and popular culture==
*The similarities between the different set meals were satirised by &quot;My life as McDull&quot;, a McDull movie.
*As an important part of Hong Kong culture, &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; is featured in many Hong Kong movies and TV dramas:
**Featured in popular sitcom &quot;Virtues of Harmony&quot;, a TVB-made soap opera tells the story of a family who runs a &quot;cha chaan teng&quot;, usually boasting the egg tart and &quot;silk-stocking milk tea&quot; produced by them. 
**Stephen Chow played a &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; waiter in the 1998 comedy &quot;The Lucky Guy&quot; (行運一條龍), and a &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; meal-delivery-boy in &quot;King of Comedy&quot; (喜劇之王) in 1999.
*Some beverage companies put the term &quot;cha chaan teng&quot; on their products, such as &quot;&quot;cha chaan teng&quot; milk tea&quot; and &quot;&quot;cha chaan teng&quot; lemon tea&quot;.
* MC Cheung&#x27;s &#x27;Loser&#x27; music video was filmed in a real &quot;bing teng&quot; in Yau Ma Tei in 2021. He acted as a staff in it.
* Keung To&#x27;s role in the 2022 Hong Kong film &quot;Mama&#x27;s Affair&quot;.

<text>The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a numerical variational technique devised to obtain the low-energy physics of quantum many-body systems with high accuracy. As a variational method, DMRG is an efficient algorithm that attempts to find the lowest-energy matrix product state wavefunction of a Hamiltonian. It was invented in 1992 by Steven R. White and it is nowadays the most efficient method for 1-dimensional systems.

== History ==
The first application of the DMRG, by Steven R. White and Reinhard Noack, was a &quot;toy model&quot;: to find the spectrum of a spin 0 particle in a 1D box. This model had been proposed by Kenneth G. Wilson as a test for any new renormalization group method, because they all happened to fail with this simple problem. The DMRG overcame the problems of previous renormalization group methods by connecting two blocks with the two sites in the middle rather than just adding a single site to a block at each step as well as by using the density matrix to identify the most important states to be kept at the end of each step. After succeeding with the &quot;toy model&quot;, the DMRG method was tried with success on the quantum Heisenberg model.
==Principle==

The main problem of quantum many-body physics is the fact that the Hilbert space grows exponentially with size. In other words if one considers a lattice, with some Hilbert space of dimension formula_1 on each site of the lattice, then the total Hilbert space would have dimension formula_2, where formula_3 is the number of sites on the lattice. For example, a spin-1/2 chain of length &quot;L&quot; has 2&quot;L&quot; degrees of freedom. The DMRG is an iterative, variational method that reduces effective degrees of freedom to those most important for a target state. The state one is most often interested in is the ground state.

After a warmup cycle, the method splits the system into two subsystems, or blocks, which need not have equal sizes, and two sites in between. A set of &quot;representative states&quot; has been chosen for the block during the warmup. This set of left blocks + two sites + right blocks is known as the superblock. Now a candidate for the ground state of the superblock, which is a reduced version of the full system, may be found. It may have a rather poor accuracy, but the method is iterative and improves with the steps below.

The candidate ground state that has been found is projected into the Hilbert subspace for each block using a density matrix, hence the name. Thus, the &quot;relevant states&quot; for each block are updated. 

Now one of the blocks grows at the expense of the other and the procedure is repeated. When the growing block reaches maximum size, the other starts to grow in its place. Each time we return to the original (equal sizes) situation, we say that a &quot;sweep&quot; has been completed. Normally, a few sweeps are enough to get a precision of a part in 1010 for a 1D lattice.

==Implementation guide==

A practical implementation of the DMRG algorithm is a lengthy work. A few of the main computational tricks are these:

* Since the size of the renormalized Hamiltonian is usually in the order of a few or tens of thousand while the sought eigenstate is just the ground state, the ground state for the superblock is obtained via iterative algorithm such as the Lanczos algorithm of matrix diagonalization. Another choice is the Arnoldi method, especially when dealing with non-hermitian matrices.
* The Lanczos algorithm usually starts with the best guess of the solution. If no guess is available a random vector is chosen. In DMRG, the ground state obtained in a certain DMRG step, suitably transformed, is a reasonable guess and thus works significantly better than a random starting vector at the next DMRG step.
* In systems with symmetries, we may have conserved quantum numbers, such as total spin in a Heisenberg model. It is convenient to find the ground state within each of the sectors into which the Hilbert space is divided.

==Applications==

The DMRG has been successfully applied to get the low energy properties of spin chains: Ising model in a transverse field, Heisenberg model, etc., fermionic systems, such as the Hubbard model, problems with impurities such as the Kondo effect, boson systems, and the physics of quantum dots joined with quantum wires. It has been also extended to work on tree graphs, and has found applications in the study of dendrimers. For 2D systems with one of the dimensions much larger than the other DMRG is also accurate, and has proved useful in the study of ladders.

The method has been extended to study equilibrium statistical physics in 2D, and to analyze non-equilibrium phenomena in 1D.

The DMRG has also been applied to the field of quantum chemistry to study strongly correlated systems.

== Example: Quantum Heisenberg model ==
Let us consider an &quot;infinite&quot; DMRG algorithm for the formula_4 antiferromagnetic quantum Heisenberg chain. The recipe can be applied for every translationally invariant one-dimensional lattice.

DMRG is a renormalization-group technique because it offers an efficient truncation of the Hilbert space of one-dimensional quantum systems.

=== Starting point ===
To simulate an infinite chain, start with four sites. The first is the &quot;block site&quot;, the last the &quot;universe-block site&quot; and the remaining are the &quot;added sites&quot;, the right one is added to the universe-block site and the other to the block site.

The Hilbert space for the single site is formula_5 with the base formula_6. With this base the spin operators are formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9 for the single site. For every block, the two blocks and the two sites, there is its own Hilbert space formula_10, its base formula_11 (formula_12)and its own operatorsformula_13where

* block: formula_14, formula_15, formula_16, formula_17, formula_18, formula_19
* left-site: formula_20, formula_21, formula_22, formula_23, formula_24
* right-site: formula_25, formula_26, formula_27, formula_28, formula_29
* universe: formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, formula_35

At the starting point all four Hilbert spaces are equivalent to formula_5, all spin operators are equivalent to formula_7, formula_8 and formula_9 and formula_40. In the following iterations, this is only true for the left and right sites.

=== Step 1: Form the Hamiltonian matrix for the superblock ===
The ingredients are the four block operators and the four universe-block operators, which at the first iteration are formula_41 matrices, the three left-site spin operators and the three right-site spin operators, which are always formula_41 matrices. The Hamiltonian matrix of the &quot;superblock&quot; (the chain), which at the first iteration has only four sites, is formed by these operators. In the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic S=1 model the Hamiltonian is:

formula_43

These operators live in the superblock state space: formula_44, the base is formula_45. For example: (convention):

formula_46

formula_47

The Hamiltonian in the &quot;DMRG form&quot; is (we set formula_48):

formula_49

The operators are formula_50 matrices, formula_51, for example:

formula_52

formula_53

=== Step 2: Diagonalize the superblock Hamiltonian ===
At this point you must choose the eigenstate of the Hamiltonian for which some observables is calculated, this is the &quot;target state&quot; . At the beginning you can choose the ground state and use some advanced algorithm to find it, one of these is described in:

* &quot;The Iterative Calculation of a Few of the Lowest Eigenvalues and Corresponding Eigenvectors of Large Real-Symmetric Matrices&quot;, Ernest R. Davidson; Journal of Computational Physics 17, 87-94 (1975)

This step is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm.

If formula_54 is the target state, expectation value of various operators can be measured at this point using formula_55.

=== Step 3: Reduce density matrix ===
Form the reduced density matrix formula_56 for the first two block system, the block and the left-site. By definition it is the formula_57 matrix: formula_58

Diagonalize formula_56 and form the formula_60 matrix formula_61, which rows are the formula_62 eigenvectors associated with the formula_62 largest eigenvalues formula_64 of formula_56. So formula_61 is formed by the most significant eigenstates of the reduced density matrix. You choose formula_62 looking to the parameter formula_68: formula_69.

=== Step 4: New block and universe-block operators ===
Form the formula_57 matrix representation of operators for the system composite of the block and left-site, and for the system composite of right-site and universe-block, for example:

formula_71

formula_72

formula_73

formula_74

Now, form the formula_75 matrix representations of the new block and universe-block operators, form a new block by changing basis with the transformation formula_61, for example:formula_77At this point the iteration is ended and the algorithm goes back to step 1.

The algorithm stops successfully when the observable converges to some value.

==Matrix product ansatz==

The success of the DMRG for 1D systems is related to the fact that it is a variational method within the space of matrix product states (MPS). These are states of the form

: formula_78

where formula_79 are the values of the e.g. &quot;z&quot;-component of the spin in a spin chain, and the &quot;A&quot;&quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; are matrices of arbitrary dimension &quot;m&quot;. As &quot;m&quot; → ∞, the representation becomes exact. This theory was exposed by S. Rommer and S. Ostlund in .

In quantum chemistry application, formula_80 stands for the four possibilities of the projection of the spin quantum number of the two electrons that can occupy a single orbital, thus formula_81, where the first (second) entry of these kets corresponds to the spin-up(down) electron. In quantum chemistry, formula_82 (for a given formula_80) and formula_84 (for a given formula_85) are traditionally chosen to be row and column matrices, respectively. This way, the result of formula_86 is a scalar value and the trace operation is unnecessary. formula_87 is the number of sites (the orbitals basically) used in the simulation.

The matrices in the MPS ansatz are not unique, one can, for instance, insert formula_88 in the middle of formula_89, then define formula_90 and formula_91, and the state will stay unchanged. Such gauge freedom is employed to transform the matrices into a canonical form. Three types of canonical form exist: (1) left-normalized form, when 

:formula_92
for all formula_93, (2) right-normalized form, when
:formula_94
for all formula_93, and (3) mixed-canonical form when both left- and right-normalized matrices exist among the formula_3 matrices in the above MPS &quot;ansatz&quot;.

The goal of the DMRG calculation is then to solve for the elements of each of the formula_97 matrices. The so-called one-site and two-site algorithms have been devised for this purpose. In the one-site algorithm, only one matrix (one site) whose elements are solved for at a time. Two-site just means that two matrices are first contracted (multiplied) into a single matrix, and then its elements are solved. The two-site algorithm is proposed because the one-site algorithm is much more prone to getting trapped at a local minimum. Having the MPS in one of the above canonical forms has the advantage of making the computation more favorable - it leads to the ordinary eigenvalue problem. Without canonicalization, one will be dealing with a generalized eigenvalue problem.

==Extensions==

In 2004 the time-evolving block decimation method was developed to implement real-time evolution of matrix product states. The idea is based on the classical simulation of a quantum computer. Subsequently, a new method was devised to compute real-time evolution within the DMRG formalism - See the paper by A. Feiguin and S.R. White .

In recent years, some proposals to extend the method to 2D and 3D have been put forward, extending the definition of the matrix product states. See this paper by F. Verstraete and I. Cirac, .

<doc id="564533" wikidata="Q7190438" url="?curid=564533" title="Pibgorn (webcomic)">
<text>Pibgorn is a webcomic by Brooke McEldowney begun in early 2002. The title character is a fairy whose adventures span the fantasy and real worlds. McEldowney also creates the syndicated comic strip &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot;, occasionally crossing over to &quot;Pibgorn&quot;, which explores stronger themes of sexuality and violence.

== Publication history ==
===Origins===
&quot;Pibgorn&quot; slowly evolved over the years after McEldowney had begun &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot;, wherein Edda would occasionally have flights of fancy where she appeared as a prototype Pibgorn on rare occasions. He finally started adapting the idea into a proposed spin-off entitled &quot;The Titans&quot;, which was rejected by syndicate editors, in 2000. These proposed strips and accompanying sketches were presented on the &quot;Pibgorn&quot; website in 2005 during one of McEldowney&#x27;s hiatuses from the strip.

&quot;Titans&quot; would have been a gag-a-day format strip, in which Pibgorn (named Oola Inch here), disenchanted with her expected role as a fairy, usually would break away from her regular routine to wax philosophical. Unfortunately, Oola was also one of life&#x27;s losers, her dialogues often resulting in misfortune, such as having a Magic 8 Ball roll over her, or nearly being eaten by whatever animal she&#x27;s conversing with (a spider, a duckling, etc.). The strips also showed a darker side to her character, as in addition to managing dewdrops, her responsibilities include serving as the &quot;voices-in-my-head&quot; of disgruntled government employees, driving one to attempted homicide on at least one occasion.

The final set of proposal strips showed Oola running afoul of Prince Crewth and Gaggot, here named Prince Grabstein and Rhune, when she petitions to leave &quot;dewdrop brigade&quot; and become a stand-up comedian. Unable to tell if she&#x27;s laughing with him or at him, Grabstein outlaws laughter altogether and sets Luciano after Oola, only for the fly to fall in love with her. These situations were later recycled as part of the early &quot;Pibgorn&quot; story arcs.

===Format===

Until April 18, 2007, &quot;Pibgorn&quot; was published on internet by United Feature Syndicate on their Comics.com website. It has also been published as a graphic novel, &quot;Pibgorn: The Girl in the Coffee Cup&quot;, which was released in October 2006. Other releases include &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;The Poltergeist in the Piano&quot;, and &quot;The Borgia Cantus&quot;. Possibly because of graphic novel considerations, &quot;Pibgorn&quot; is characterized by involved story arcs which may seem better suited to a graphic novel than a daily comic, and it is also notable for its creative use of color and large format, together with strong themes of violence (explicit) and sexuality (generally implicit), attributes not usually associated with daily print comics. The artist has made the point that he wants to create a story without worrying about the editors of family newspapers. 

&quot;Pibgorn&quot; originally ran daily Monday through Saturday, but on February 8, 2006, it was announced that beginning on February 13, the strip would run only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It ended its run on Comics.com on April 18, 2007, and resumed with GoComics.com on May 14, 2007. McEldowney stated the burden of writing two daily strips concurrently as the reason for the cutback. As of July 14, 2008, the strip began running 5 days a week, Monday through Friday; McEldowney indicated in his blog that despite time constraints, he wanted the story to move along at a brisker pace.

=== Discontinuation from Comics.com===
On April 17, 2007, United Feature Syndicate announced through Comics.com that &quot;Pibgorn&quot; would be discontinued on the following day. Brooke McEldowney has indicated that United Feature Syndicate accommodated his request to be released from his contract in order to secure a new online home for &quot;Pibgorn.&quot;

From a letter from Brooke McEldowney to his readers:

With United Media&#x27;s announcement that &quot;Pibgorn&quot; is to be discontinued, I have been inundated with e-mail, much of it agitated and distressed. I&#x27;m very sorry you had to get the news in this rather dispassionate way. That I may answer your central question forthwith, I&#x27;ve composed this response for everyone – so please forgive me if I seem impersonal.

&quot;PIBGORN&quot; WILL CONTINUE.

There. That is the main thing I wanted to say. Comics.com, however, will, as they have announced, no longer be the source. Nothing dramatic happened, really. I simply came to feel that the editorial needs of comics.com and those of &quot;Pibgorn&quot; were becoming more and more divergent and incompatible. For this reason I asked to be released from my contract with United Media in order to secure a new online home for &quot;Pibgorn&quot;. United Media, most graciously, and reluctantly, agreed. In short order I hope to get Pib back up and flying.

Meanwhile, you have seen the most current installments of &quot;Pibgorn&quot;. Hold that thought. We&#x27;ll be back.

All best wishes, and thanks so very much for writing.

After the move to GoComics.com, the content became more risqué, including nudity and implied sexual content. For example, in the August 22, 2008, strip, Geoff is seen walking down the street, nude, with his bare buttocks on display.

===Return of &quot;Pibgorn&quot;===
&quot;Pibgorn&quot; returned to the Web on May 14, 2007, at gocomics.com, owned by Universal Press Syndicate. Continuing in its three-per-week format, the interrupted story arc was presented from the start so as not to confuse new readers.

In late 2015 Pibgorn switched to presenting an older series of WAHOO TERMINAL comics, which continued through September 2016. Afterwards, &quot;Pibgorn&quot; returned to its earlier story arc, but on an intermittent basis while presenting some experimental styles.

On August 17, 2017, McEldowney posted a note on &quot;Pibgorn&quot;″s Gocomics page, explaining that he was still recovering from a stroke, and that in the meantime there would be a rerun of the storyline &quot;Pibgorn and the Djinn of It&quot;, which began four days later, on August 21.

==Characters==

* Pibgorn: The title character, a fairy who is not satisfied flitting around when she could be getting into trouble instead. She is sweet, effervescent, charming and flighty, with a succubus for a best friend and a human for a sweetheart. She has a talent for trouble, a knack for friendship, and a magical kiss — the &quot;baiser de la fée&quot;, or &quot;fairy&#x27;s kiss&quot; — which can effect miraculous healing or change the size of herself and others. She is drawn as a lithe young woman with simultaneously red and blonde hair, and insect-like wings growing from her back. She is neither clothed nor nude; her body is covered with varying shades of green, which McEldowney describes as being &quot;dappled&quot;. She can however wrap her wings around her body, transforming into clothes.
* Drusilla: A rather manipulative succubus who is used to getting what she wants, she seems to have resigned herself to the fact that Geoff genuinely loves Pib rather than her. She has made it clear, though, that if Pib hurts Geoff, Dru will make her sorry. Their relationship has developed into an alliance bordering on friendship. Like Pibgorn, her body is &quot;dappled&quot;, covered with shades of magenta and violet, but arranged to bare more, accentuating her bosom and navel. She has black hair, which she often wears in long tresses to cover her ears, which are stag-horn in shape, indicative of her status as a demon.
*Geoff: Pib&#x27;s slightly geeky sweetheart, he is a former church organist and now Pib&#x27;s and Drusilla&#x27;s accompanist, having been ostracized from the community when Drusilla accidentally revealed her true identity to the local pastor. He is loyal and affectionate, and protective of those he cares about. Not a stereotypical swashbuckling hero type, Geoff nevertheless has consistently shown bravery in order to help save Pibgorn and others around him from danger. He is also getting better acquainted with the supernatural world and has on occasion been able to guesstimate a solution. He apparently holds a great interest in musical history, as he has shown a surprising amount of biographical knowledge about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
*Oognat: The hair fairy—not as bold or adventurous as Pibgorn, Oognat nonetheless ends up in many of the same difficulties as her companion fairy.
*Thorax: Possibly a visitor from another galaxy, a guest character from &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot;.
*Maurice: A field mouse, he has been a friend of Pib&#x27;s from the beginning, and he tries valiantly to keep up and help where he can. When last seen, he&#x27;d apparently become the companion of a Humphrey Bogart-influenced ex-demon.
*Prince Crewth: The fairy monarch who was exasperated enough by Pib&#x27;s flouting of the rules (the last of which he invented against some action Pib had already done and made it retroactively effective) to order her assassination. Whenever he reappears in a strip, it is usually to re-authorize her termination for some perfectly senseless reason, although he is often side-tracked by the appearance of Drusilla or some other, more intimidating presence. Indolent and proud of it, he is mind-numbingly bureaucratic and blind to the repercussions of his actions. He is drawn as a miniature satyr with a resemblance to former U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.
*Gaggot: Prince Crewth&#x27;s oily lawyer/doctor, who seems to fancy himself as something of a power behind the throne, easily able to lead the prince around by the nose. Despite this, he often finds himself serving as Crewth&#x27;s right-hand man in the various tasks set upon them by Drusilla and others, which inevitably results in physical harm to both of them. Because of this, his patience with his monarch would appear to be wearing thin. He is drawn as a standard fictional wizard or vizier, wearing robes and a long, grey beard. He is the most human-looking fairy to appear in the strip, without insect wings or goat-legs, and could pass for a miniature human.
*Luciano: a horsefly who is Prince Crewth&#x27;s consultant and sometime court assassin, whose only weakness appears to be Pib. He proves to be completely unable to bring himself to hurt her, and instead falls head over heels.
*Henmellyn: Drusilla&#x27;s daughter. She first appears on January 19, 2004, and subsequently &quot;dies.&quot; She does not reappear until March 24, 2011, as a pawn in the hands of the demon Stan, who uses her to draw Drusilla to him.
*Stan: a hypermasculine satyr, half-goat, half-human, much in the image of the Greek god Pan. He appears in a storyline that started in the Pibgorn strip for March 24, 2011, with the reappearance of Drusilla&#x27;s daughter all but drowned in a pool of lava in Hell. He is cruel, violent, extremely powerful, and seems bent on Drusilla&#x27;s destruction, which he seems to accomplish in the strips for May 16–19, 2011. As of May 20, 2011, we learn that his plot involves Geoff in some way. (All of the above strips can be accessed using the date search functions at http://www.gocomics.com/pibgorn.)
*Nat Bustard: A gumshoe-type detective who constantly narrates his actions, reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart noir crime films.

==Storylines==

Pibgorn has completed 13 distinct adventures to date, and has begun another. The story arcs are as follows, named as McEldowney conceived them:

*The Girl in the Coffee Cup (initially started on comics.com, then restarted February 19, 2002; the strip changed to color on March 11, the earliest strip in the GoComics.com archive). Pibgorn the fairy meets and falls in love with Geoff, to the annoyance of his girlfriend Drusilla, who Geoff learns is a succubus demon in human form.
*The Poltergeist in the Piano (started November 11, 2002). About midway through this story, McEldowney switched from a daily newspaper strip format to a larger format.
*The Borgia Cantus (started August 11, 2003). This story introduces Nat Bustard.
*Drusilla&#x27;s Daughter (started January 17, 2004)
*The Internal Fairy Harvesting Service (started October 18, 2004). Oognat makes her first appearance. This story introduced Thorax from &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot; as a recurring character in later story arcs.
*Mozart and the Demon Lover (started May 23, 2005, repeated with commentary starting November 9, 2011). Geoff and Mozart switch places in time. Geoff struggles to finish Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; while Thorax helps Mozart understand what is happening.
*A Pibsummer Night&#x27;s Dream (started February 13, 2006) presents the Pibgorn Players, along with the cast of &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot;, performing William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; against a 1930s backdrop à la &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.
*Lena the Horrible (started March 21, 2007). This is the longest story arc, running for two years with over 400 strips. It takes place inside a computer-generated world created by a demon.
*Pibgorn and the Volcano on 77th Street and Park Avenue (started March 17, 2009)
*&quot;The Stone Coin&quot; (started November 23, 2009) is a departure from the canon characters and is instead an illustrated story that McEldowney wrote in 1988.
*Pibgorn and the Graveyard Shift (started January 21, 2010). Drusilla enters a repressed memory from Pibgorn&#x27;s past that affects her actions in the present.
*Pibgorn and the Brunch with Death (started December 27, 2010)
*Pibgorn and The Djinn of It (started September 17, 2012)
*Romeo and Juliet (started July 29, 2013) presents the Pibgorn Players, along with a few cast members from &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot;, performing William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in its traditional setting with many 1920s references.
*Guy le Pain: Le Pain Guy (started November 19, 2014)
*&quot;Wahoo Terminal&quot; (started November 28, 2015): McEldowney revisits one of his early attempts at a syndicated strip that was ultimately rejected.
*Luda and Ut, or The Provenance of Pib (started January 14, 2019). McEldowney re-started this story on October 13, 2019, presenting it as a &quot;text with illustrations&quot; rather than a comic strip.

<doc id="564544" wikidata="Q6795924" url="?curid=564544" title="Maximum time in grade">
<text>Maximum time in grade in a military force is the longest amount of time that an officer or enlisted man is allowed to remain in the service without being promoted. If the soldier has not been promoted by the time he reaches MTIG, he is discharged from the service. Today, a recruit may enter the service at 17 years old and stay in service until age 65, for a total of 48 years of service. 

== Record holder ==
The record holder for the longest enlisted service is Chief Torpedoeman Harry Simond Morris (1887-1975), who entered the U.S. Navy at age 15 as an apprentice boy, and served for 55 years of continuous service, a record that cannot be surpassed under current regulations. 

Morris was the last living apprentice boy entitled to wear the apprentice &quot;knot&quot; on his uniform, and he was the founder and chairman of the &quot;Great White Fleet Association,&quot; which held annual reunion dinners to commemorate the cruise at the U. S. Grant Hotel in downtown San Diego.

<doc id="564545" wikidata="Q6177834" url="?curid=564545" title="Jenners">
<text>Jenners was a department store in Edinburgh, Scotland, situated on Princes Street. It was Scotland&#x27;s oldest independent department store until the retail business was acquired by House of Fraser in 2005. It closed in December 2020 and was vacated by House of Fraser in May 2021. The building is currently undergoing restoration to be repurposed as a hotel.

== History ==
Jenners was founded as &quot;Kennington &amp; Jenner&quot; in 1838 by Charles Jenner FRSE (1810–1893), a linen draper, and Charles Kennington. The store has never left its site on Princes Street, but its original building was destroyed by fire in 1892. In 1893 the Scottish architect William Hamilton Beattie was appointed to design a replacement, which subsequently opened in 1895. It is now a category A listed building.

Jenners was run for many years by the Douglas Miller family, descendants of James Kennedy, who took charge of the store after Charles Jenner retired in 1881. Known as the &quot;Harrods of the North&quot;, it has held a Royal Warrant since 1911, and was visited by Queen Elizabeth II on the occasion of its 150th anniversary in 1988. 

=== Sale to House of Fraser ===
On 16 March 2005 it was announced that the Douglas Miller family were in advanced negotiations to sell the business to the House of Fraser, at an estimated price of £100–200 million, but a month later it was sold for £46.1 million. While other acquisitions by House of Fraser had been renamed, Jenners kept its identity.
The store made national news in 2007 when it publicly announced that it would stop selling paté de foie gras, following a boycott by the Duke and Duchess of Hamilton. In 2008, House of Fraser invested £3 million in improvements to the store. As a result of this, in 2016 the basement toy department was rebranded under the Hamleys name, before being closed in 2019.

The lease of the building remained with the Jenners holding company JPSE Ltd, owned by the Douglas Miller family. In August 2005 it was sold to Moorcroft Capital Management, owned by Jenners&#x27; former chief executive Robbie Douglas Miller. In 2017 the building was bought by Danish billionaire fashion retailer and landowner in Scotland Anders Holch Povlsen, reportedly for £53 million.

In late 2019 it was reported that the business was considering reducing its size or moving from Princes Street.

=== Department store closure ===
In January 2021, it was announced that Jenners was closing and 200 jobs would be lost. The Jenners signage was removed from the Princes Street building on 14 April 2021, reportedly to the surprise of the owners of the building. Edinburgh City Council issued a Listed Building enforcement notice on 21 April 2021 to Sports Direct Retail, the Mike Ashley company that owns the Frasers Group, to reinstate the Jenners letters on the eastern and southern sides of the department store, as these had been removed without listed building consent. In May 2021, it was announced that the restoration of the building will take four years, and that the store was planned to reopen without the House of Fraser livery once redevelopment had completed.

===Proposed hotel conversion ===
In June 2022, AAA United, the company owned by Anders Holch Povlsen, was granted planning permission to convert the building to a 96-room hotel. Under the plans, the three-storey central atrium would be retained, as would the Jenners signage. The hotel rooms would occupy the upper floors, with new retail use, restaurants and cafés at the lower levels, and a new roof-top bar.

===2023 fire===
On 23 January 2023, a fire broke out at the rear of the empty building. Five firefighters were injured, one of whom, 38-year old Barry Martin, was critically injured and died four days later. Eyewitnesses described smoke pouring out of the basement area of the department store.

==Architecture==
The present Jenners building in Edinburgh was designed in 1893 by William Hamilton Beattie in an ornate, early Renaissance Revival style, embellished with a variety of columns, ornamental cornices and decorative balustrading. The building is situated on a slope, with six storeys and an attic level; on the south-east corner is a canted 7-storey tower. At Charles Jenner&#x27;s insistence the building&#x27;s facade was decorated with rows of female caryatids &quot;to show symbolically that women are the support of the house&quot;. The new store featured many technical innovations such as electric lighting and hydraulic lifts, 
In 1903, the store was extended northwards towards Rose Street by Beattie&#x27;s partner, Andrew Robb Scott, in a style matching Beattie&#x27;s original design. A further extension was added to the west along Princes Street by Tarbolton &amp; Ochterlony in 1955. The Jenners building is especially noted for its grand saloon hall, with consoled wooden galleries rising three storeys with an elaborate strapwork timber stair, and topped with a glass and queen-post timber roof. Each winter, a large Christmas tree erected in the grand hall became a popular annual visitor attraction.

In 1970s, the Jenners store was designated a category A listed building by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.

==Stores==
Jenners had two shops in 2020:
*Princes Street, Edinburgh
*Loch Lomond Shores

The Jenners store in the Loch Lomond Shores outlet in Balloch remains in operation but as a dual Frasers and Sports Direct store, branding from Jenners practically absent.

Jenners previously had stores at Edinburgh Airport and Glasgow International Airport that closed following a decision announced in April 2007. Jenners said that security measures introduced in UK airports following the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot had led to a significant downturn in trade at the shops.

<text>Alfredo Catalani (19 June 1854 – 7 August 1893) was an Italian operatic composer. He is best remembered for his operas &quot;Loreley&quot; (1890) and &quot;La Wally&quot; (1892). &quot;La Wally&quot; was composed to a libretto by Luigi Illica, and features Catalani&#x27;s most famous aria &quot;Ebben? Ne andrò lontana.&quot; This aria, sung by American soprano Wilhelmenia Fernandez, was at the heart of Jean-Jacques Beineix&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Diva&quot;. Catalani&#x27;s other operas were much less successful.

==Life and career==

Born in Lucca, Catalani came from a musical family. He was trained at the Milan Conservatory, where his teachers included Antonio Bazzini. Despite the growing influence of the &quot;verismo&quot; style of opera during the 1880s and early 1890s, Catalani chose to compose in a more traditional manner, which had traces of Wagner in it. As a result, his operas (&quot;La Wally&quot; excepted) have largely lost their place in the modern repertoire, even compared to those of Massenet and Puccini, whose style his own periodically resembles. (Catalani much resented Puccini&#x27;s emergence and even accused Puccini, falsely, of plagiarism.)

The influence of Amilcare Ponchielli can also be recognized in Catalani&#x27;s output. Catalani&#x27;s reputation, like Ponchielli&#x27;s, now rests almost entirely on one work. However, while &quot;La Wally&quot; enjoys occasional revivals, Ponchielli&#x27;s &quot;La Gioconda&quot; has always been the more popular opera of the two (287 performances, most recently in 2008 at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, as opposed to only four for &quot;La Wally&quot;, not produced there since 1909).

In 1893, upon his premature death from tuberculosis in Milan, Catalani was interred in the Cimitero Monumentale, where Ponchielli and conductor Arturo Toscanini also lie. A passionate admirer of Catalani&#x27;s music, Toscanini even named one of his daughters Wally. Toscanini recorded the prelude to Act IV of &quot;La Wally&quot; and the &quot;Dance of the Water Nymphs&quot; from &quot;Loreley&quot; in Carnegie Hall in August 1952 with the NBC Symphony Orchestra for RCA Victor.

In 1981, his work was highlighted by the release of &quot;Diva&quot;, a thriller directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix which employed the aria from &quot;La Wally&quot;.
==Operas==
*&quot;La falce&quot; (&quot;The Sickle&quot;), Milan, 19 July 1875
*&quot;Elda&quot;, Turin, 31 January 1880 (radically revised as &quot;Loreley&quot;)
*&quot;Dejanice&quot;, Milan, 17 March 1883
*&quot;Edmea&quot;, Milan, 27 February 1886
*&quot;Loreley&quot;, Turin, 16 February 1890
*&quot;La Wally&quot;, Milan, 20 January 1892

==Symphonic works==
*&quot;Sinfonia a piena orchestra&quot; (&quot;Symphony for Full Orchestra&quot;), 1872 
*&quot;Il Mattino, sinfonia romantica&quot; (&quot;Morning&quot;, Romantic symphony), 1874

<doc id="564557" wikidata="Q924692" url="?curid=564557" title="John S. Horner">
<text>John Scott Horner (December 5, 1802 – February 3, 1883) was a U.S. politician, Secretary and acting Governor of Michigan Territory, 1835–1836 and Secretary of Wisconsin Territory, 1836–1837.

==Early life==
Horner was born in what is now Warrenton, Virginia, the third of eight children of Gustavus Brown Horner and Frances Harrison Scott Horner. He attended a private boarding school near Middleburg, Virginia run by a Scottish Presbyterian clergyman. He attended Washington College (now known as Washington and Jefferson College) in Washington County, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1819. He then studied law, was admitted to the bar in Virginia and maintained a successful private practice in Fauquier, Loudoun, and Rappahannock counties. In October, 1834, Horner married Harriet L. Watson, the daughter of James Watson, U.S. Senator from New York.

==Political career==
On August 15, 1835, President Andrew Jackson appointed Horner to be Secretary (and acting Governor) of the Michigan Territory, replacing the popular Stevens T. Mason. The circumspect Horner knew he was entering office in a volatile situation. Michigan had satisfied all the requirements set out in the Northwest Ordinance to become a state, however the U.S. Congress had repeatedly rejected or ignored Michigan&#x27;s petition for statehood, due to two very contentious issues:
# There was an acrimonious border dispute with the state of Ohio, which became known as the Toledo War.
# Southern slave states were reluctant to increase the number of northern free states.
Jackson, facing reelection in 1836, did not want to alienate Ohio, with its many electoral votes. So he removed the popular Mason from office. Mason was agitating for statehood and was, at that time, unyielding in demands regarding the Toledo Strip. At Mason&#x27;s urging, Michigan had drafted a constitution on its own without the sanction of an Enabling Act from Congress. The people adopted the constitution in October 1835 and at the same time elected Mason as governor along with a full slate of state officials (the state government was not recognized by Congress until 1837, when Michigan became a state).

So Horner had to appease irate Ohioans as well as deal with an unauthorized, but popular local government that undermined his own authority as Territorial Governor. Horner was at least partially successful, in that he helped to avert violence (aside from some minor scuffles) and persuaded both parties to wait for the upcoming session of Congress to propose a resolution. Despite heading alternate governments, there was little disagreement between Mason and Horner, with Horner mostly staying out of the way in local politics.

In August 1835, while Michigan prepared itself for statehood, Mason had separated all of the territory which was not going to be part of the state into a separate jurisdiction in order to provide some continuity in governance. Horner had replaced Mason as Territorial Secretary in the interim and was to assume responsibility for the western territory. But he was delayed for various reasons and the western area had its own government for a time without any official representative of the federal government. Congress organized the Wisconsin Territory on July 3, 1836, and Horner assumed the office of Secretary, leaving the &quot;de facto&quot;, if unrecognized, government of the state of Michigan to Mason.

As Secretary of the Wisconsin Territory, Horner&#x27;s first acts were to administer the oaths of office to Governor Henry Dodge and the judges of the supreme court with Charles Dunn as chief justice, and William C. Frazer and David Irvin as associate justices.

In June 1837, Jackson transferred Horner to become Register of the Green Bay Land Office. Horner resisted requests by friends and relatives to move back east to Virginia, and in 1847, Horner moved to a farm on the south shore of Green Lake in present-day Green Lake County. In 1849, he was elected probate judge for Marquette County (which then included Green Lake County). He held this office until the court was abolished in 1854.
==Later life==
Horner was one of the original settlers of the present day city of Ripon, Wisconsin. In 1851, Horner also helped establish Ripon College. His former home, now known as the John Scott Horner House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Death==
Horner died in Ripon in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, at the age of eighty. He is interred at Hillside Cemetery, Ripon, Wisconsin.

==Family life==
He married Harriet L. Watson (1805–1883) in October 1834, who died two months after him in Ripon.

<text>The Tinkertoy Construction Set—commonly known as Tinkertoy, Tinker Toy, or plural forms thereof—is a construction set for children. It was designed in 1914 and was originally manufactured in Evanston, Illinois, U.S. The brand is now owned by Hasbro.

==History==
The construction set was designed in 1914—six years after Frank Hornby&#x27;s Meccano sets—by Charles H. Pajeau, who formed the Toy Tinker Company in Evanston, Illinois, to manufacture them. Pajeau, a stonemason, designed the set after seeing children play with sticks and empty spools of thread. Pajeau partnered with Robert Pettit and Gordon Tinker to market a toy that would allow and inspire children to use their imaginations. After an initially-slow start, over a million were sold.

The cornerstone of the set is a wooden spool roughly in diameter, with holes drilled every 45 degrees around the perimeter and one through the center. Unlike the center, the perimeter holes do not go all the way through. With the differing-length sticks, the set was intended to be based on the Pythagorean progressive right triangle.

The sets were introduced to the public through displays in and around Chicago which included model Ferris wheels. Tinkertoys have been used to construct complex machines, including Danny Hillis&#x27;s tic-tac-toe-playing computer (now in the collection of the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California) and a robot at Cornell University in 1998.

One of Tinkertoy’s distinctive features is the toy’s packaging. Initially, the mailing tube design was chosen to reduce shipping costs. Early versions of the packaging included an address label on the tube with space for postage. To assist buyers in differentiating between the various offerings, sets were placed in mail tube packages of different sizes and also delineated with a number (e.g.: 116, 136) and a name (e.g.: major, prep, big boy, junior, grad). A colorful &quot;how-to&quot; instruction guide accompanied each set. In the 1950s, color was added and the wooden sticks appeared in red, green, blue, and peach.

The main manufacturing location was a four-story plant at 2012 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, Illinois.

Tinkertoys were inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in Rochester, New York, in 1998.

Hasbro bought the Tinkertoy brand and currently produces both Tinkertoy Plastic and Tinkertoy Classic (wood) sets and parts. The US rights are now owned by Basic Fun!. In 2024, Basic Fun filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company will use bankruptcy proceedings to repay its creditors while remaining in operation.

==Standard parts==
In addition to the spools, a standard Tinkertoy set includes:

* Wheels, which are thinner than spools, but larger in diameter. Like spools, their center holes have a snug fit.
* Caps, originally wooden, but later plastic, cylindrical pieces with a single blind axial hole snugly fitted to the rods.
* Couplings, small cylindrical pieces (originally wood; later plastic) approximately long and slightly over in diameter, with snug-fitting blind-drilled holes in either end, and a loose-fitting through-drilled hole crosswise through the center of the part.
* Pulleys, identical to spools, except that the center holes are loose-fitting.
* &quot;Part W&quot;, approximately in diameter with perimeter holes 90 degrees apart, loose-fitting center holes, and four tight-fitting through-drilled holes parallel to the center hole. This allows for free-spinning parts, and also for construction of &quot;cage&quot; or &quot;lantern&quot; gears.
* Short pointed sticks (originally wood, but later plastic), typically red, and flags (&quot;fan blades&quot;), typically green plastic, and various other small parts.

Spools and pulleys all have a single groove around the outside; &quot;Part W&quot; has two parallel grooves.

Sticks (or &quot;rods&quot;) are slotted on each end, both to provide slight flexibility when inserted into snug-fitting holes, and to allow thin cards, flags, and strings to be inserted into the slots. They are color-coded by size; in the 1960s-era sets, they were, in order from shortest to longest, orange, peach, blue, red, green, and violet. Each successively longer rod is (with allowances for the size of the spools) the next smaller size times the square root of two; thus any two of the same size will combine with one of the next size up, and three spools, to form an isosceles right triangle (45°–45°–90°).

Tinkertoy sticks before 1992 were made with a diameter of . The earlier sets had natural wood sticks, but changed to colored sticks in the late 1950s. From measurement, the orange sticks are inches long; peach, ; blue, ; red, ; green, ; and purple, . Spools are inches in diameter with holes of inch depth.

Most of the larger sets also include a driveshaft (an unfinished wooden rod without slotted ends, of an intermediate length between &quot;green&quot; and &quot;violet&quot;, normally turned with a small plastic crank.

The Ultra Construction Set also includes connectors, small cylindrical plastic pieces approximately long with a slot in either end and a slotted hole crosswise through the center of the part.

Sets with battery-powered electric motors were available; these sets also typically included at least one wooden &quot;double pulley&quot; with a single snug-fitting through-drilled center hole, and grooved rims at two diameters, allowing different moving parts to operate at different speeds.

In the Toy Story series:

Tinkertoys are seen in the famous film Toy Story, as seen scattered across Andy&#x27;s room. The characters use these as dumbbells for exercise training.

In the second film, they are seen yet again scattered across Andy&#x27;s room. However, these Tinkertoys are wood, not plastic like the first film. They are shown disorganized in the toy box with no container.

They are last seen in Toy Story 3, being used as the supports for the railroad in the Wild West scene at the beginning at the film. They are yet again wood, with their very last appearance in the Sunnyside Daycare.

<text>The Town class was a group of twenty-one light cruisers built for the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) of the first half of the 20th century. These vessels were long-range cruisers, suitable for patrolling the vast expanse covered by the British Empire. These ships, initially rated as second class cruisers, were built to a series of designs, known as the &quot;Bristol&quot; (five ships), &quot;Weymouth&quot; (four ships), &quot;Chatham&quot; (three RN ships, plus three RAN ships), &quot;Birmingham&quot; (three ships, plus one similar RAN ship) and &quot;Birkenhead&quot; (two ships) classes – all having the names of British towns except for the RAN ships, which were named after Australian cities.

==Design==
=== &quot;Bristol&quot; class ===

The &quot;Bristol&quot; class were all ordered under the 1908–09 Programme and commissioned in late 1910. They were second class cruisers suitable for a variety of roles including both trade protection and fleet duties. They were long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and full load. Twelve Yarrow three-drum boilers fed steam turbines rated at , giving a speed of . One ship, &quot;Bristol&quot;, had Brown-Curtis turbines driving two propeller shafts, while the remaining three ships used Parsons turbines driving four shafts. Speed during sea trials varied between (&quot;Glasgow&quot;) and (&quot;Bristol&quot;). The experimental two-shaft layout of &quot;Bristol&quot; was successful, giving greater efficiency, especially at lower speeds. The ships used both coal and oil for fuel, with 1353 tons of coal and 260 tons of oil carried, giving an endurance of about at .

The &quot;Bristol&quot;s were protected cruisers, with an armoured deck providing protection for the ships&#x27; vitals. The armoured deck was thick over the magazines and machinery, over the steering gear and elsewhere. The conning tower was protected by of armour, with the gun shields having armour, as did the ammunition hoists. As the protective deck was at waterline, the ships were given a large metacentric height so that they would remain stable in the event of flooding above the armoured deck. This, however, resulted in the ships rolling badly, making them poor gun platforms. One problem with the armour of the &quot;Bristol&quot;s which was shared with the other Town-class ships was the sizable gap between the bottom of the gun shields and the deck, which allowed shell splinters to pass through the gap, leading to large numbers of leg injuries in the ships&#x27; gun crews.

It was originally intended that the &quot;Bristol&quot; class would be fitted with a main gun armament of unshielded guns, but the need to counter German light cruisers (such as the ), which were armed with ten guns that outranged British 4-inch guns, resulted in the new class&#x27;s armament being revised. They had two BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XI naval guns mounted on the ships&#x27; centreline fore and aft, with ten BL 4-inch Mk VII guns in waist mountings. All these guns were fitted with shields. Four Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) saluting guns were fitted, while two submerged 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted, with seven torpedoes carried. This armament was considered rather too light for ships of this size, while the waist guns were subject to immersion in a high sea, making them difficult to work.

They had a crew of 480 officers and men, with the officers accommodated in the forward part of the ship, rather than aft as per tradition, following the instructions of Admiral Fisher to improve fighting efficiency. This arrangement was unpopular, however, as it was preferred to keep officer&#x27;s and other ranks accommodation separate for disciplinary reasons, while the &quot;Bristol&quot; class were very cramped, with only for each seaman to live, eat, and sleep. In the First World War, the class&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament was increased with the fitting of a single QF 3 inch (76 mm) 20 cwt gun.

===&quot;Weymouth&quot; class===
The &quot;Weymouth&quot; class were ordered under the 1909–1910 Programme and commissioned between 1911 and 1912. Major changes from the &quot;Bristol&quot; class included a heavier main armament of eight 6 in guns, and changes to improve seaworthiness and reduce overcrowding. They were long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and full load. Machinery was similar to the &quot;Bristol&quot; class, with again a single example (&quot;Yarmouth&quot;) having the Brown-Curtis turbines and two-shaft arrangement used in &quot;Bristol&quot;, while the remaining three ships had the four-shaft, Yarrow turbine machinery. Speed remained 25 knots.
Armour remained unchanged from the &quot;Bristol&quot;s, while the main gun armament was changed to eight BL 6 inch Mk XI guns. The arrangement of the armament was revised, with three guns (one on the centreline and two on the beam) on an enlarged forecastle that also provided accommodation for the ships&#x27; officers. The remaining waist guns were protected by a bulwark to make them more weather resistant. Torpedo armament was increased, with two 21-inch (533 mm) submerged tubes (with seven torpedoes carried), while the ships&#x27; armament was completed by four 3-pounder saluting guns.

The class saw a number of alterations during the war, including the addition of a single 3 in (76 mm) AA gun in 1915, while the surviving ships were fitted with director control equipment for the ships&#x27; guns on a new tripod foremast. In 1917, &quot;Yarmouth&quot; was the first light cruiser to be able to operate aircraft, being fitted with a ramp above the conning tower and forecastle gun to allow a Sopwith Pup to be launched from the ship, although the aircraft could not land back on it so the pilot would have to ditch into the sea if it was not possible to reach land. In 1918, &quot;Weymouth&quot; also received a similar installation.

===&quot;Chatham&quot; class===

The &quot;Chatham&quot; class of six ships, three for the Royal Navy and three for Australia (of which one was to be built in Australia) were ordered under the 1910–1911 Programme. The five British-built ships commissioned between 1912 and 1913, while &quot;Brisbane&quot;, the Australian-built ship was laid down in 1913 and completed in 1916. The major difference between the &quot;Chatham&quot;s and the earlier Towns was a revised armour scheme. While the earlier ships were protected cruisers, depending on an armoured deck deep within the ship to protect machinery and magazines, the &quot;Chatham&quot;s relied on a vertical belt of armour.

The &quot;Chatham&quot; class were long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and full load. The belt consisted of of nickel-steel on top of of high-tensile steel, tapering from forward and to aft. It covered from above the waterline to below it. This belt was part of the load bearing structure of the ship, reducing the overall weight of structure required. A thin armoured deck, over most of its length and over the steering gear, was retained, mainly as a watertight deck. The ships&#x27; forecastle was again extended aft, reaching two-thirds of the length of the ship, and allowing two more guns to be raised up onto the forecastle, while the ships&#x27; metacentric height was reduced, making the ships better gun platforms. Officer&#x27;s accommodation was moved back to the rear of the ships in this class. Machinery layout was again similar to the earlier Towns, with one ship, &quot;Southampton,&quot; having a two-shaft layout. It was rated at giving a speed of .
While main armament again consisted of eight 6 in guns in single mountings, a new gun, the BL 6 inch Mk XII was used. This was shorter and lighter than the Mk XI guns used in earlier ships, and while range was slightly less ( compared to ), they were much easier to handle in rough weather and were more accurate. They had larger magazines, giving up to 200 rounds per gun rather than 150 in earlier ships. The remaining armament was unchanged.

Wartime changes were similar to those made to the &quot;Weymouth&quot;s, with a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun fitted during 1915 and director control with its associated tripod mast fitted later in the war. Four of the ships (&quot;Dublin&quot;, &quot;Southampton&quot;, &quot;Melbourne&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot;) were fitted for platforms for operating aircraft.

===&quot;Birmingham&quot; class===

The 1911–1912 Programme brought the &quot;Birmingham&quot; class. Three ships were ordered for the Royal Navy, commissioning in 1914. A fourth, similar, ship, &quot;Adelaide&quot;, was built in Sydney for Australia. The First World War caused the construction of &quot;Adelaide&quot;, which was reliant on materials and parts from the United Kingdom, to be heavily delayed, with &quot;Adelaide&quot; not completing until 1922. They were closely based on the &quot;Chatham&quot; class but with a revised armament. While in theory, three guns could fire forwards in the previous arrangement (the forward centreline gun and the forward two waist guns), in practice the effects of blast from the waist guns on the bridge and conning tower prevented this. The solution was to mount two guns side-by side on the forecastle, forward of the bridge, giving a total armament of nine BL 6 inch Mk XII guns. The remainder of the armament was unchanged (i.e. four 3-pounder saluting guns and two submerged 21-inch torpedo tubes).

The ships were long overall (&quot;Adelaide&quot; was long), with a beam of and a draught of . They displaced normal and deep load (&quot;Adelaide&quot; displaced normal and deep load). The ships&#x27; forecastle had increased flare to reduce spray. The ships&#x27; machinery was rated at giving a speed of .

A 3-inch anti-aircraft gun was fitted in 1915, while &quot;Lowestoft&quot; and &quot;Birmingham&quot; were fitted with director control. (&quot;Nottingham&quot; was lost before it could be fitted). &quot;Adelaide&quot; was completed with these modifications, and received a major refit in the 1930s, with coal-fired boilers being removed along with a funnel, reducing the ship&#x27;s speed, while one 6-inch was removed, with 4-inch anti-aircraft guns added. She was subject to further armament revisions during the Second World War, with more 6- and 4-inch guns removed to accommodate depth charge throwers, and radar being fitted.

===Further developments: Atlantic cruisers and &quot;Hawkins&quot; class===

In 1912, work began on a new cruiser for trade protection duties in response to rumours of large German cruisers that were thought to being built for commerce raiding. A series of designs were drawn up for what became known as the &quot;Atlantic cruiser&quot;, featuring various combinations of 7.5-inch (190 mm) and 6-inch guns, mixed oil- and coal-fired boilers and speeds of between and . When the rumoured German ships proved to be false, the Atlantic cruiser was abandoned.

In 1915, as a response to German commerce raiding in the early months of the war, the British Admiralty decided to build a new class of large, fast and heavily armed cruisers for trade protection work. Again, a mixed armament of 7.5 in and 6 in guns were chosen, with mixed oil- and coal-fired boilers in order to aid operations in distant waters where oil supplies would be limited. The new design became known as the &quot;Improved &quot;Birmingham&quot;&quot; class or , with five being built, completing between 1918 and 1925.

===&quot;Birkenhead&quot; class===
In early 1914, the Greek Navy, in response to Turkish naval expansion, placed an order with the Coventry Syndicate, a consortium of the shipbuilders Cammell Laird, Fairfields, John Brown and the armament company Coventry Ordnance Works, for two light cruisers and four destroyers. The light cruisers, which were both to be built by Cammell Laird, and to be named &quot;Antinavarchos Kountouriotis&quot; and &quot;Lambros Katsonis&quot;, were based on the design of the &quot;Chatham&quot; and &quot;Birmingham&quot; classes, but with a revised armament to be supplied by the Coventry Ordnance Works.

The new cruisers were long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was between and normal, and between and deep load. Armour was as fitted to the &quot;Chatham&quot;s. Machinery was also as in the &quot;Chatham&quot;s. The first ship, later to become &quot;Birkenhead&quot;, had the same mixed oil-and coal-fired boilers, with the machinery rated at with a speed of , but the second ship (later &quot;Chester&quot;) had all oil-fired boilers, which boosted power to and speed to . The ships&#x27; main armament was ten QF 5.5 in (140 mm) Mark I guns (50 calibres long) to a new design by Coventry Ordnance Works. The guns fired an shell to a range of . The lighter shell was easier to handle, and gave a greater rate of fire. It was planned to fit the ships with two 12-pounder (76 mm) anti-aircraft guns, while two 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted.

Work continued on the two ships for the Greeks after the outbreak of the First World War, but early in 1915, with no sign of an end to the war, the British Admiralty took over the contract for the two ships, which became the &quot;Birkenhead&quot; class, together with the 5.5-inch guns and ammunition. The ships&#x27; main armament was kept by the Royal Navy, and proved to be successful in service, with the 5.5 in gun being selected as secondary armament for the battlecruisers and and the aircraft carrier . The 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns were unavailable, however, and Vickers 3-pounder guns were fitted in their place.

After the war, they were offered for sale back to the Greeks, but this offer was not taken up.

==Ships==
==Operational service==

The class saw much service in the First World War and many of the ships left their mark on history. Ships of the class saw action at the Battles of Coronel, the Battle of the Falkland Islands and the Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914. That same year, &quot;Sydney&quot; attacked in an action that lasted over an hour and resulted in the German warship being beached by her captain to avoid his ship sinking. Also that year, &quot;Birmingham&quot; became the first ship to sink a submarine when she rammed the German submarine on 9 August.

In 1915, HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; found , which had escaped from the engagement at the Falkland Islands the previous year, in which &quot;Glasgow&quot; had helped in sinking . &quot;Dresden&quot; was eventually scuttled by her own crew after a short engagement. Ships of the class also took part in the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915.
In 1916, ships of the class also saw action at the Battle of Jutland, the largest surface engagement of the First World War . In 1917, a Sopwith Pup from HMS &quot;Yarmouth&quot; became the first aircraft from a cruiser to shoot down an aircraft, specifically the Zeppelin L23. The ships of the class saw more service than mentioned above, including action against German merchant ships. During the course of the war, two ships of the class were sunk: these were HMS &quot;Falmouth&quot; and HMS &quot;Nottingham&quot;, both torpedoed by German submarines.

After the end of the First World War, the surviving ships performed a variety of duties, including service on foreign stations. All ships, except &quot;Adelaide&quot;, were scrapped by the 1930s. &quot;Adelaide&quot; saw an extensive refit between 1938 and 1939. However, &quot;Adelaide&quot; was obsolete when the Second World War began, and she saw limited service, performing patrol and escort duties in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. She was decommissioned in 1945, but recommissioned to become a tender at Sydney. She was broken up in 1949.

<text>The Rockefeller family ( ) is an American industrial, political, and banking family that owns one of the world&#x27;s largest fortunes. The fortune was made in the American petroleum industry during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by brothers John D. Rockefeller and William A. Rockefeller Jr., primarily through Standard Oil (the predecessor of ExxonMobil and Chevron Corporation). The family had a long association with, and control of, Chase Manhattan Bank. By 1987, the Rockefellers were considered one of the most powerful families in American history. 

The Rockefellers originated in Rhineland in Germany and family members moved to the Americas in the early 18th century, while through Eliza Davison, with family roots in Middlesex County, New Jersey, John D. Rockefeller and William A. Rockefeller Jr. and their descendants are also of Scots-Irish ancestry.

==Background==
The Rockefeller family traces their origin to the now abandoned German village Rockenfeld in the early 17th century. The American family branch is descended from Johann Peter Rockefeller (1681-1763), who migrated from the Rhineland to Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania around 1723. In the US, he became a plantation owner and landholder in Somerville, and Amwell, New Jersey.
One of the first members of the Rockefeller family in New York was businessman William A. Rockefeller Sr., who was born to a Protestant family in Granger, New York. He had six children with his first wife Eliza Davison, a daughter of a Scots-Irish farmer, the most prominent of which were oil tycoons John D. Rockefeller and William A. Rockefeller Jr., the co-founders of Standard Oil. John D. Rockefeller (known as &quot;Senior&quot;, as opposed to his son John D. Rockefeller Jr., known as &quot;Junior&quot;) was a devout Northern Baptist, and he supported many church-based institutions. While the Rockefeller family are mostly Baptists, some of the Rockefellers were Episcopalians.

==Wealth==

The combined wealth of the family—their total assets and investments plus the individual wealth of its members—has never been known with any precision. The records of the family archives relating to both the family and individual members&#x27; net worth are closed to researchers.

From the outset, the family&#x27;s wealth has been under the complete control of the male members of the dynasty, through the family office. Despite strong-willed wives who had influence over their husbands&#x27; decisions—such as the pivotal female figure Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr.—in all cases they received allowances only and were never given even partial responsibility for the family fortune.

Much of the wealth has been locked up in the family trust of 1934 (which holds the bulk of the fortune and matures on the death of the fourth generation) and the trust of 1952, both administered by Chase Bank, the corporate successor to Chase Manhattan Bank. These trusts have consisted of shares in the successor companies to Standard Oil and other diversified investments, as well as the family&#x27;s considerable real estate holdings. They are administered by a trust committee that oversees the fortune.

Management of this fortune today also rests with professional money managers who oversee the principal holding company, Rockefeller Financial Services, which controls all the family&#x27;s investments. The Rockefeller Center is no longer owned by the family. Its present chairman and patriarch is David Rockefeller Jr.

In 1992, it had five main arms:
*Rockefeller &amp; Co. (Money management: Universities have invested some of their endowments in this company);
* Venrock Associates (Venture Capital: an early investment in Apple Computer was one of many it made in Silicon Valley entrepreneurial start-ups);
*Rockefeller Trust Company (Manages hundreds of family trusts);
*Rockefeller Insurance Company (Manages liability insurance for family members);
*Acadia Risk Management (Insurance Broker: Contracts out policies for the family&#x27;s vast art collections, real estate and private planes.)

== Real estate and institutions ==
The family was heavily involved in numerous real estate construction projects in the U.S. during the 20th century. Chief among them:
* Rockefeller Center, a multi-building complex built at the start of the Depression in Midtown Manhattan. The construction of Rockefeller Center was financed solely by the family
* International House of New York, New York City, 1924 (John Jr.) {Involvement: John III, Abby Aldrich, David &amp; Peggy, David Jr., Abby O&#x27;Neill}
* &quot;Wren Building&quot;, College of William and Mary, Virginia, from 1927 (Renovation funded by Junior)
* Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, from 1927 onwards (Junior), Abby Aldrich, John III and Winthrop, historical restoration
* Museum of Modern Art, New York City, from 1929 (Abby Aldrich, John Jr., Blanchette, Nelson, David, David Jr., Sharon Percy Rockefeller)
* Riverside Church, New York City, 1930 (John Jr.)
* The Cloisters, New York City, from 1934 (John Jr.)
* Rockefeller Apartments, New York City, 1936 (John Jr., Nelson)
* The Interchurch Center, New York City, 1948 (John Jr.)
* Asia Society (Asia House), New York City, 1956 (John III)
* One Chase Manhattan Plaza, New York City, 1961 (David)
* &quot;Nelson A. Rockefeller&quot; Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York, 1962 (Nelson)
* Lincoln Center, New York City, 1962 (John III)
* World Trade Center Twin Towers, New York City, 1973–2001 (David and Nelson)
* Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, 1974 (David)
* Council of the Americas/&quot;Americas Society&quot;, New York City, 1985 (David)
*In addition to this is Senior and Junior&#x27;s involvement in seven major housing developments:
** &quot;Forest Hill Estates&quot;, Cleveland, Ohio
** &quot;City Housing Corporation&quot;&#x27;s efforts, Sunnyside Gardens, Queens, New York City
** &quot;Thomas Garden Apartments&quot;, The Bronx, New York City
** &quot;Paul Laurence Dunbar Housing&quot;, Harlem, New York City
** &quot;Lavoisier Apartments&quot;, Manhattan, New York City
** &quot;Van Tassel Apartments&quot;, Sleepy Hollow, New York (formerly North Tarrytown)
** A development in Radburn, New Jersey
** A further project involved David Rockefeller in a major middle-income housing development when he was elected in 1947 as chairman of Morningside Heights, Inc., in Manhattan by fourteen major institutions that were based in the area, including Columbia University. The result, in 1951, was the six-building apartment complex known as &quot;Morningside Gardens&quot;.
* Senior&#x27;s donations led to the formation of the University of Chicago in 1889; the Central Philippine University in the Philippines (The first Baptist university and second American university in Asia); and the Chicago School of Economics. This was one instance of a long family and Rockefeller Foundation tradition of financially supporting Ivy League and other major colleges and universities over the generations—seventy-five in total. These include:
** Harvard University
** Dartmouth College
** Princeton University
** University of California, Berkeley
** Stanford University
** Yale University
** Massachusetts Institute of Technology
** Brown University
** Tufts University
** Columbia University
** Cornell University
** University of Pennsylvania
** Spelman College
** Case Western Reserve University
** Institutions overseas such as London School of Economics and University College London, among many others.
* Senior (and Junior) also created
** Rockefeller University in 1901
** &quot;General Education Board&quot; in 1902, which later (1923) evolved into the &quot;International Education Board&quot;
** &quot;Rockefeller Sanitary Commission&quot; in 1910
** &quot;Bureau of Social Hygiene&quot; in 1913 (Junior)
** &quot;International Health Division&quot; in 1913
** &quot;China Medical Board&quot; in 1915.
** Rockefeller Museum, British Mandate of Palestine, 1925–30
** In the 1920s, the International Education Board granted important fellowships to pathbreakers in modern mathematics, such as Stefan Banach, Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, and André Weil, which was a formative part of the gradual shift of world mathematics to the US over this period.
** To help promote cooperation between physics and mathematics Rockefeller funds also supported the erection of the new Mathematical Institute at the University of Göttingen between 1926 and 1929
** The rise of probability and mathematical statistics owes much to the creation of the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, partly by the Rockefellers&#x27; finances, also around this time.
** John D Jr. established International House at Berkeley.
** Junior was responsible for the creation and endowment of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, which operates the restored historical town at Williamsburg, Virginia, one of the most extensive historic restorations ever undertaken.

==Residences==
Over the generations, the family members have resided in some historic homes. A total of 81 Rockefeller residences are on the National Register of Historic Places. Not including all homes owned by the five brothers, some of the more prominent of these residences are:

* One Beekman Place - The residence of Laurance in New York City.
* 10 West 54th Street - A nine-story single-family home, the former residence of Junior before he shifted to 740 Park Avenue, and the largest residence in New York City at the time, it was the home for the five young brothers; it was later given by Junior to the Museum of Modern Art.
* 13 West 54th Street - A four-story townhouse used by Junior and Abby between 1901 and 1913.
* 740 Park Avenue - Junior and Abby&#x27;s famed 40-room triplex apartment in the luxury New York City apartment building, which was later sold for a record price.
* Bassett Hall - The house at Colonial Williamsburg bought by Junior in 1927 and renovated by 1936, it was the favourite residence of both Junior and Abby and is now a house museum at the family-restored Colonial Revival town.
* The Casements - A three-story house at Ormond Beach in Florida, where Senior spent his last winters, from 1919 until his death.
* The Eyrie - A sprawling 100-room summer holiday home on Mount Desert Island in Maine, demolished by family members in 1962.
* Forest Hill - The family&#x27;s country estate and a summer home in Cleveland, Ohio, for four decades; built and occupied by Senior, it burned down in 1917.
* Golf House at Lakewood, New Jersey - The former three-story clubhouse for the elite Ocean County Hunt and Country Club, which Senior bought in 1902 to play golf on its golf course.
* Kykuit, also known as the John D. Rockefeller Estate - The landmark six-story, 40-room home on the vast Westchester County family estate, home to four generations of the family.
* The JY Ranch - The landmark ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the holiday resort home built by Junior and later owned by Laurance, which was used by all members of the family and had many prominent visitors, including presidents until Laurance donated it to the federal government in 2001.
* &quot;The Rocks&quot; - 1940 Shepard Street NW and 2121 Park Road NW, Washington, DC - The 12,000 square foot house sits on 15.9 acres bordering Rock Creek Park; and is the largest residential property in the District of Columbia. Built by Daisy Blodgett for her daughter Mona in 1927, the name refers to its location, not the current owner. The property was purchased by Jay Rockefeller in 1984 when he became US Senator for West Virginia. He and his wife, Sharon Percy Rockefeller continue to live there.
* Rockwood Hall - The former home of William Rockefeller Jr. (demolished in the 1940s).
* Rockefeller Guest House - The guest house of Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller.

==Politics==
Prominent banker David Rockefeller Sr. was the family patriarch until his death in 2017. In 1960, when his brother Nelson Rockefeller was governor of New York, David Sr. successfully pressed for a repeal of a New York state law that restricted Chase Manhattan Bank from operating outside the city. David Sr. was twice offered the post of Treasury secretary by President Richard M. Nixon, but declined on both occasions. In 1979, he used his high-level contacts to bring Mohammad Reza Shah of Iran, who had been overthrown in the Iranian Revolution and was in poor health, for medical treatment in the United States. In 1998, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton for his work on International Executive Service Corps.

==Legacy==
A trademark of the dynasty over its 140-plus years has been the remarkable unity it has maintained, despite major divisions that developed in the late 1970s, and unlike other wealthy families such as the Du Ponts and the Mellons. A primary reason has been the lifelong efforts of &quot;Junior&quot; to not only cleanse the name from the disgrace stemming from the ruthless practices of Standard Oil but his tireless efforts to forge family unity even as he allowed his five sons to operate independently. This was partly achieved by regular brothers and family meetings, but it was also because of the high value placed on family unity by first Nelson and John III, and later especially with David.

Regarding achievements, in 1972, on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s philanthropy, the Carnegie Corporation, which has had a long association with the family and its institutions, released a public statement on the influence of the family on not just philanthropy but encompassing a much wider field. Summing up a predominant view among the international philanthropic world, albeit one poorly grasped by the public, one sentence of this statement read: &quot;The contributions of the Rockefeller family are staggering in their extraordinary range and in the scope of their contribution to humankind.&quot;

John D. Rockefeller gave away US$540 million over his lifetime (in dollar terms of that time), and became the greatest lay benefactor of medicine in history. His son, Junior, also gave away over $537 million over his lifetime, bringing the total philanthropy of just two generations of the family to over $1 billion from 1860 to 1960. Added to this, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared in a report in November 2006 that David Rockefeller&#x27;s total charitable benefactions amount to about $900 million over his lifetime.

The combined personal and social connections of the various family members are vast, both in the United States and throughout the world, including the most powerful politicians, royalty, public figures, and chief businessmen. Figures through Standard Oil alone have included Henry Flagler and Henry H. Rogers. Contemporary figures include Henry Kissinger, Richard Parsons (chairman and CEO of Time Warner), C. Fred Bergsten, Peter G. Peterson (Senior Chairman of the Blackstone Group), and Paul Volcker.

In 1991, the family was presented with the Honor Award from the National Building Museum for four generations worth of preserving and creating some of the U.S.&#x27;s most important buildings and places. David accepted the award on the family&#x27;s behalf. The ceremony coincided with an exhibition on the family&#x27;s contributions to the built environment, including John Sr.&#x27;s preservation efforts for the Hudson River Palisades, the restoration of Williamsburg, Virginia, construction of Rockefeller Center, and Governor Nelson&#x27;s efforts to construct low- and middle-income housing in New York state.

John Jr., through his son Nelson, purchased and then donated the land upon which sits the United Nations headquarters, in New York, in 1946. Earlier, in the 1920s, he had also donated a substantial amount towards the restoration and rehabilitation of major buildings in France after World War I, such as the Rheims Cathedral, the Fontainebleau Palace and the Palace of Versailles, for which he was later (1936) awarded France&#x27;s highest decoration, the Grand Croix of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur (subsequently also awarded decades later to his son, David Rockefeller).

He also funded the excavations at Luxor in Egypt, as well as establishing a Classical Studies School in Athens. In addition, he provided the funding for the construction of the Palestine Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem - the Rockefeller Museum.

===Conservation===
Beginning with John D. Rockefeller Sr., the family has been a major force in land conservation. Over the generations, it has created more than 20 national parks and open spaces, including the Cloisters, Acadia National Park, Forest Hill Park, the Nature Conservancy, the Rockefeller Forest in California&#x27;s Humboldt Redwoods State Park (the largest stand of old-growth redwoods), and Grand Teton National Park, among many others. John Jr., and his son Laurance (and his son Laurance Jr. aka Larry) were particularly prominent in this area.

The family was honoured for its conservation efforts in November 2005, by the National Audubon Society, one of the United States&#x27; largest and oldest conservation organizations, at which over 30 family members attended. At the event, the society&#x27;s president, John Flicker, stated: &quot;Cumulatively, no other family in America has made the contribution to conservation that the Rockefeller family has made&quot;.

In 2016 fifth-generation descendants of John Sr. criticized ExxonMobil, one of the successors to his company Standard Oil, for their record on climate change. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Family Fund both backed reports suggesting that ExxonMobil knew more about the threat of global warming than it had disclosed. David Kaiser, grandson of David Rockefeller Sr. and president of the Rockefeller Family Fund, said that the &quot;...company seems to be morally bankrupt.&quot; Valerie Rockefeller Wayne, daughter of former Senator Jay Rockefeller, said, &quot;Because the source of the family wealth is fossil fuels, we feel an enormous moral responsibility for our children, for everyone -- to move forward.&quot; The Rockefeller Brothers Fund announced it was divesting from fossil fuels in September 2014, the Rockefeller Family Fund announced plans to divest in March 2016, and the Rockefeller Foundation pledged to dump their fossil fuel holdings in December 2020. With a $5 billion endowment, the Rockefeller Foundation was &quot;the largest US foundation to embrace the rapidly growing divestment movement.&quot; CNN writer Matt Egan noted, &quot;This divestment is especially symbolic because the Rockefeller Foundation was founded by oil money.&quot; In May 2021 Rockefeller descendants Rebecca Rockefeller Lambert and Peter Gill Case announced a ten-year funding initiative, the Equation Campaign, to fight new fossil fuel development.

===The archives===

Rockefeller Sr. William Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Abby Rockefeller Mauzé, John D. Rockefeller III, Blanchette Rockefeller, and Nelson Rockefeller are processed and open by appointment to readers in the Archive Center&#x27;s reading room.

<text>Dean George Cain (né Tanaka; born July 31, 1966) is an American actor. From 1993 to 1997, he played Clark Kent / Superman in the TV series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. Cain was the host of &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; and appeared in the sports drama series &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;.

==Early life==
Dean George Tanaka was born on July 31, 1966, in Michigan to Roger Tanaka, a U.S. serviceman, and actress Sharon Thomas. Through his biological father, Cain is partly of Japanese descent, with the rest of his ancestry being Welsh, Irish and French Canadian. Cain has said of his biological father, whom he never met: &quot;He&#x27;s not the kind of man I want to be. He was an unfaithful husband and not much of a father.&quot; Soon after Dean&#x27;s birth, his mother, pursuing an acting career, moved him and his older brother Roger to Los Angeles. In 1969, Sharon married film director Christopher Cain, who adopted Dean and Roger. The couple moved to Malibu, California, and later had a daughter, Krisinda.

Cain attended Santa Monica High School, where he excelled in sports. Among his schoolmates were Charlie Sheen, who played on the same baseball team as Cain when they were children, as well as Rob Lowe and his brother, Chad. Cain graduated from high school in 1984 and attended Princeton University, where he starred as a free safety on the football team, set a Princeton season record with 12 interceptions (in just ten games) during the 1987 season, and finished his collegiate career with 22 interceptions in 30 games. During his senior year, Cain was awarded the John P. Poe–Richard W. Kazmaier, Jr. Football Trophy. He dated actress Brooke Shields while at the university. Cain graduated in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. His senior thesis was titled &quot;The History and Development of the Functions of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&quot;.

===NFL===
After graduating, Cain signed on as a free agent with the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills, but a knee injury during training camp ended his football career prematurely.

==Career==

With little hope of returning to sports, Cain turned to screenwriting and then acting, shooting dozens of commercials including a volleyball-themed spot for Kellogg&#x27;s Frosted Flakes and appearing on popular television shows like &quot;Grapevine&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.

In 1993, Cain took on his biggest role to date as Superman in the television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. At the height of its popularity the program brought in an average of at least 15 million viewers per episode. The series ran for four seasons, ending in 1997. Cain later made his first return to the Superman franchise with a special guest role in a season seven episode of &quot;Smallville&quot; as the immortal Dr. Curtis Knox, a character based upon the DC Comics villain Vandal Savage; Cain returned to the &quot;Superman&quot; universe again between 2015 and 2017, in a recurring role on &quot;Supergirl&quot;, as the title character&#x27;s foster father, Jeremiah Danvers.

In 1998, Cain started the Angry Dragon Entertainment production company, which produced the TBS Superstation television series &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; He has also starred in several films, including &quot;The Broken Hearts Club&quot; (2000), &quot;Rat Race&quot; (2001), &quot;Out of Time&quot; (2003), and &quot;Bailey&#x27;s Billion$&quot; (2004). In 2004, he portrayed Scott Peterson in the made-for-television movie &quot;The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story&quot;. He appeared in a recurring role as Casey Manning in the television series &quot;Las Vegas&quot;. He is also the star of the VH1 hit series &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; as Pete Davenport, who is the new head coach of a fictional NBA team and has an illegitimate daughter who is a cheerleader for his NBA team. 

In 2009, Cain was ranked No. 33 on VH1&#x27;s 40 Hottest Hotties of the &#x27;90s.
Cain was a contestant in an NBC celebrity reality competition series called &quot;Stars Earn Stripes&quot;. He won four out of six missions on the show, though he came in third in the finals. In 2012, he participated in Fox&#x27;s dating game show &quot;The Choice&quot;.

In 2013, Cain hosted a reality show about Bigfoot titled &quot;10 Million Dollar Bigfoot Bounty&quot;, where he offered contestants $10 million to prove the existence of Bigfoot. Cain later appeared in the mid-season premiere of &quot;Comic Book Men&quot;, appearing at Kevin Smith&#x27;s Secret Stash where the crew was celebrating 75 years of Superman, where it was claimed that his portrayal of the character helped people care about Superman again. Cain appeared in the film &quot;God&#x27;s Not Dead&quot;, in which he plays an arrogant businessman. In 2016, Cain played a guest role on the Netflix original series &quot;Lady Dynamite&quot; as Graham the ex-fiancé of Maria Bamford.

Cain is known for appearing in 16 Christmas films and several faith-based films.

As of 2018, Cain is hosting a television infomercial for The National Real Estate Network, an entity which seeks to persuade individuals to attend meetings where they can learn about flipping real estate. In October 2018, it was learned that Ronnie Mund (Ronnie the Limo Driver), the personal driver and bodyguard of radio DJ Howard Stern, had been using a photoshopped picture of Cain as a publicity photo. Specifically, Mund&#x27;s head had been transposed onto the body of Cain. Mund initially denied the photo was altered but eventually acknowledged he had been using the fraudulent photo for over five years. Mund claimed he was unaware the photo was not genuine. Cain co-starred in the 2018 film &quot;&quot; about the investigation and trial of Kermit Gosnell. He starred in the film &quot;Andy the Talking Hedgehog&quot;.

In 2019, Cain starred in the play &quot;FBI Lovebirds&quot; alongside Kristy Swanson, a play that mocked Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, two FBI agents who were briefly on the team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

In June 2021, it was announced that he would make his directorial debut with &quot;Little Angels&quot; and star in it.

Cain is the Actor in Residence at High Point University.

==Personal life==
During the 1980s, Cain dated actress Brooke Shields for two years while they were both attending Princeton University. In 1992, he dated professional beach volleyball player and model Gabrielle Reece. In 1997, Cain became engaged to singer Mindy McCready; the couple split the following year.

He has a son named Christopher Dean Cain (born June 11, 2000) with ex-girlfriend and &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate and Spanish model Samantha Torres. Cain named his son after his stepfather, film director Christopher Cain.

On June 19, 2018, Cain was sworn in as a reserve police officer for the St. Anthony Police Department in Idaho.

===Political views===
Cain said in 2018 that he was once a registered Republican, but later became a registered Independent, feeling that the Republican Party did not fully represent his views.

Cain voted for Bill Clinton twice, and voted for Al Gore in the 2000 United States presidential election, the latter of which he later said he regretted. He supported John McCain in the 2008 election, and supported Rick Perry in the 2012 election. In 2016 and 2020, he endorsed and voted for Donald Trump. He also endorsed him for the 2024 election.

Cain has stated he is &quot;very leftist&quot; on social issues, citing his support of marijuana legalization, and conservative on economic and foreign policy issues.

In 2018, Cain was elected to the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America.

<doc id="564568" wikidata="Q379912" url="?curid=564568" title="Bernard Mandeville">
<text>Bernard Mandeville, or Bernard de Mandeville (; 15 November 1670 – 21 January 1733), was an Anglo-Dutch philosopher, political economist, satirist, writer and physician. Born in Rotterdam, he lived most of his life in England and used English for most of his published works. He became famous for &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot;.

==Life==
Mandeville was born on 15 November 1670, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where his father was a prominent physician of Huguenot origin. On leaving the Erasmus school at Rotterdam he showed his ability by an &quot;Oratio scholastica de medicina&quot; (1685), and at Leiden University in 1689 he produced the thesis &quot;De brutorum operationibus&quot;, in which he advocated the Cartesian theory of automatism among animals. In 1691 he took his medical degree, pronouncing an inaugural disputation, &quot;De chylosi vitiata&quot;. He moved to England to learn the language, and succeeded so remarkably that many refused to believe he was a foreigner. His father had been banished from Rotterdam in 1693 for involvement in the Costerman tax riots on 5 October 1690; Bernard himself may well have been involved.

As a physician Mandeville was well respected and his literary works were successful as well. His conversational abilities won him the friendship of Lord Macclesfield (chief justice 1710–1718), who introduced him to Joseph Addison, described by Mandeville as &quot;a parson in a tye-wig.&quot; He died of influenza on 21 January 1733 at Hackney, aged 62.

There is a surviving image of Mandeville but many details of his life still have to be researched. Although the name Mandeville attests a French Huguenot origin, his ancestors had lived in the Netherlands since at least the 16th century.

==Works==
===&quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot;===
In 1705, Mandeville published a poem under the title &quot;The Grumbling Hive, or Knaves Turn&#x27;d Honest&quot; (two hundred doggerel couplets). In &quot;The Grumbling Hive&quot; Mandeville describes a bee community thriving until the bees are suddenly made honest and virtuous. Without their desire for personal gain their economy collapses and the remaining bees go to live simple lives in a hollow tree, thus implying that without private vices there exists no public benefit.

In 1714, the poem was republished as an integral part of the &quot;Fable of the Bees: or, Private Vices, Public Benefits&quot;, consisting of a prose commentary, called &quot;Remarks&quot;, and an essay, &quot;An Enquiry into the Origin of Moral Virtue&quot;. The book was primarily written as a political satire on the state of England in 1705, when the Tories were accusing John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and the ministry of advocating the War of the Spanish Succession for personal reasons.

In 1723, a later edition appeared, including &quot;An Essay on Charity and Charity Schools&quot;, and &quot;A Search into the Nature of Society&quot;. The former essay criticised the charity schools, designed to educate the poor and, in doing so, instil virtue in them. Mandeville disagreed with the idea that education adds virtue because he did not believe that evil desires existed only in the poor, but rather he saw the educated and wealthy as much more crafty. Mandeville also believed that educating the poor increased their desires for material things, defeating the purpose of the school and making it more difficult to provide for them. It was vigorously combatted by, among others, Bishop Berkeley and William Law, author of &quot;The Serious Call&quot;, and in 1729 was made the subject of a prosecution for its immoral tendency.

==Ideas==
Mandeville&#x27;s philosophy gave great offence at the time, and has always been stigmatised as false, cynical and degrading. His main thesis is that the actions of men cannot be divided into lower and higher. The higher life of man is a mere fiction introduced by philosophers and rulers to simplify government and the relations of society. In fact, virtue (which he defined as &quot;every performance by which man, contrary to the impulse of nature, should endeavour the benefit of others, or the conquest of his own passions, out of a rational ambition of being good&quot;) is actually detrimental to the state in its commercial and intellectual progress. This is because it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital (economics) in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress.

===Private vice, public benefit===
Mandeville concluded that vice, at variance with the &quot;Christian virtues&quot; of his time, was a necessary condition for economic prosperity. His viewpoint is more severe when juxtaposed to Adam Smith&#x27;s. Both Smith and Mandeville believed that individuals&#x27; collective actions bring about a public benefit. However, what sets his philosophy apart from Smith&#x27;s is his catalyst to that public benefit. Smith believed in a virtuous self-interest which results in invisible co-operation. For the most part, Smith saw no need for a guide to garner that public benefit. On the other hand, Mandeville believed it was vicious greed which led to invisible co-operation if properly channelled. Mandeville&#x27;s qualification of proper channelling further parts his philosophy from Smith&#x27;s &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitude. Essentially, Mandeville called for politicians to ensure that the passions of man would result in a public benefit. It was his stated belief in the &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot; that &quot;Private Vices by the dextrous Management of a skilful Politician may be turned into Publick Benefits&quot;.

In the &quot;Fable&quot; he shows a society possessed of all the virtues &quot;blest with content and honesty,&quot; falling into apathy and utterly paralysed. The absence of self-love (cf. Hobbes) is the death of progress. The so-called higher virtues are mere hypocrisy, and arise from the selfish desire to be superior to the brutes. &quot;The moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery begot upon pride.&quot; Similarly he arrives at the great paradox that &quot;private vices are public benefits&quot;.

Among other things, Mandeville argues that the basest and vilest behaviours produce positive economic effects. A libertine, for example, is a vicious character, and yet his spending will employ tailors, servants, perfumers, cooks, prostitutes. These persons, in turn, will employ bakers, carpenters, and the like. Therefore, the rapaciousness and violence of the base passions of the libertine benefit society in general. Similar satirical arguments were made by the Restoration and Augustan satirists. A famous example is Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;Modest Defence of Publick Stews,&quot; which argued for the introduction of public, state-controlled brothels. The 1726 paper acknowledges women&#x27;s interests and mentions e.g. the clitoris as the centre of female sexual pleasure. Jonathan Swift&#x27;s 1729 satire &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; is probably an allusion to Mandeville&#x27;s title.

Mandeville was an early describer of the division of labour, and Adam Smith makes use of some of his examples.
=== Vegetarianism ===
Mandeville was a lifelong vegetarian, who embraced the concept, advanced by Gassendi, that non-human animals are sentient. Howard Williams authored a chapter on Mandeville in his 1882 book on the history of vegetarianism, &quot;The Ethics of Diet&quot;, arguing that Mandeville&#x27;s work, the &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot;, contains a sincere criticism of eating meat: &quot;I have often thought [writes Mandeville] if it was not for this tyranny which custom usurps over us, that men of any tolerable good-nature could never be reconciled to the killing of so many animals for their daily food, as long as the bountiful earth so plentifully provides them with varieties of vegetable dainties.&quot; Henry Stephens Salt, in his 1892 seminal book on animal rights, &quot;Animals&#x27; Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress&quot;, included the &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot; in the chapter, a &quot;Bibliography of the Rights of Animals&quot;. The &quot;Fable of the Bees&quot; also inspired the early vegetarianism activist Joseph Ritson to become a vegetarian.

==Influence==
While the author probably had no intention of subverting morality, his views of human nature were seen by his critics as cynical and degraded. Another of his works, &quot;A Search into the Nature of Society&quot; (1723), appended to the later versions of the &quot;Fable&quot;, also startled the public mind, which his last works, &quot;Free Thoughts on Religion&quot; (1720) and &quot;An Enquiry into the Origin of Honour and the Usefulness of Christianity&quot; (1732) did little to reassure. The work in which he approximates most nearly to modern views is his account of the origin of society. His &quot;a priori&quot; theories should be compared with the jurist Henry Maine&#x27;s historical inquiries (&quot;Ancient Law&quot;). He endeavours to show that all social laws are the crystallised results of selfish aggrandizement and protective alliances among the weak. Denying any form of moral sense or conscience, he regards all the social virtues as evolved from the instinct for self-preservation, the give-and-take arrangements between the partners in a defensive and offensive alliance, and the feelings of pride and vanity artificially fed by politicians, as an antidote to dissension and chaos.

Mandeville&#x27;s ironic paradoxes are a criticism of the &quot;amiable&quot; idealism of the Earl of Shaftesbury; their irony contrasts with the serious egoistic systems of Hobbes and Helvétius.

Mandeville&#x27;s ideas about society and politics were praised by Friedrich Hayek, a proponent of Austrian economics, in his book &quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot;. But it was above all Keynes who put it back in the spotlight in his &quot;Essay on Malthus&quot; and in the &quot;General Theory&quot;. Keynes considers Mandeville as a precursor of the foundation of his own theory of insufficient effective demand.

Karl Marx, in his seminal work Capital, praised Mandeville as &quot;an honest man with a clear mind&quot; for his conclusion that the wealth of society depended on the relative poverty of workers.

<text>John Brown of Haddington (1722 – 19 June 1787) was a Scottish minister and author. He was born at Carpow, in Perthshire. He was almost entirely self-educated, having acquired a knowledge of ancient languages while employed as a shepherd. By his own intense 
application to study, before he was twenty years of age, he had obtained an intimate knowledge of 
the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, with the last of which he was critically conversant. He 
was also acquainted with the French, Italian, German, Arabic, Persian, Syriac, and Ethiopic. His early career was varied, and he was in succession a travelling merchant, a soldier in the Edinburgh garrison in 1745, and a school-master. He was, from 1750 till his death, minister of the Burgher branch of the Secession Church in Haddington. From 1768 he was professor of divinity for his denomination, and was mainly responsible for the training of its ministers. He gained a just reputation for learning and piety. The best of his many works are his Self-Interpreting Bible and Dictionary of the Bible, works that were long very popular. The former was translated into Welsh. He also wrote an Explication of the Westminster Confession, and a number of biographical and historical sketches.

==Early life==
John Brown was born at Carpow in the parish of Abernethy, in Perthshire, Scotland, the son of a self-educated weaver and river-fisherman, also called John Brown. His mother was Catherine Millie. His parents had morning and evening worship at home. His father was a poor weaver, who could only afford to send him to school for a few &#x27;quarters.&#x27; During one month of this time he studied Latin. Even at this early period he learnt eagerly, getting up by heart &#x27;Vincent&#x27;s and Havel&#x27;s Catechisms, and the Assembly&#x27;s Larger Catechism.&#x27; When he was eleven his father died. His mother did not long survive. He himself was brought so low by &#x27;four fevers on end&#x27; that his recovery was despaired of. 

Having recovered from this illness, he had the good fortune to find a friend and protector in John Ogilvie, a shepherd venerable for age, and eminent for piety, who fed his flock among the neighbouring mountains. This worthy individual was an elder of the parish of Abernethy, yet, though a person of intelligence and religion, was so destitute of education as to be unable even to read. To supply his own deficiency, Ogilvie was glad to engage young Brown to assist him in tending his flock, and read to him during the intervals of comparative inaction and repose which his occupation afforded. To screen themselves from the storm and the heat, they built a little lodge among the hills, and to this their mountain tabernacle (long after pointed out under this name by the peasants).

Ere long it happened that Ogilvie retired from his occupation as a shepherd, and settled in the town of Abernethy. In consequence of this change, young Brown entered the service of a neighbouring farmer, who maintained a more numerous establishment than his former friend. He began to work as a herd-boy, and his contact with a wider and stranger world &#x27;seemed to cause,&#x27; he tells us, &#x27;not a little practical apostasy from all my former attainments. Even secret prayer was not always regularly performed, but I foolishly pleased myself by making up the number one day which had been deficient another.&#x27; A new attack of fever in 1741 reawakened his conscience, and on his recovery he &#x27;was providentially determined, during the noontide while the sheep which I herded rested themselves in the fold, to go and hear a sermon, at the distance of two miles, running both to and from it.&#x27;

==Secession in the Church of Scotland==

In the year 1733, four ministers of the Church of Scotland, among whom was Mr Moncrieff of Abernethy, declared a secession from its judicatures, alleging as their reasons for taking this step the following list of grievances; &quot;The sufferance of error without adequate censure; the infringement of the rights of the Christian people in the choice and settlement of ministers under the law of patronage; the neglect or relaxation of discipline; the restraint of ministerial freedom in opposing mal-administration, and the refusal of the prevailing party to be reclaimed.&quot; To this body our young shepherd early attached himself; and ventured to conceive the idea of one day becoming a shepherd of souls in that connection. He accordingly prosecuted his studies with increasing ardour and diligence, and began to attain considerable knowledge of Latin and Greek. These acquisitions he made entirely without aid from others, except that he was able occasionally to snatch an hour when the flocks were folded at noon, in order to seek the solution of such difficulties as his unaided efforts could not master, from two neighbouring clergymen the one Mr Moncrieff of Abernethy, who has just been mentioned as one of the founders of the Secession, and the other Mr Johnston of Arngask, father of the late venerable Dr Johnston of North-Leith; both of whom were very obliging and communicative, and took great interest in promoting the progress of the studious shepherd-boy.

During his life as a herd-boy he studied eagerly. He acquired a good knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. His difficulties in regard to the second of those were very great, for he could not for some time get a grammar. Notwithstanding this, he managed by the exercise of patient ingenuity to learn the letters on a method he afterwards described in detail (paper of 6 Aug. 1745 quoted in Biography), He scraped together the price of a Greek testament, and a well-known story describes how he procured it. A companion agreed to take charge of his sheep for a little, so setting out at midnight, he reached St. Andrews, twenty-four miles distant, in the morning. The bookseller questioned the shepherd-boy, and Francis Pringle, a professor of Greek happened to hear the conversation. &#x27;Boy,&#x27; said he, pointing to a passage, &#x27;read this, and you shall have the book for nothing.&#x27; Brown read the passage, got the volume, and walked home again with it (Memoir, p. 29; Dr. John Brown&#x27;s Letter to John Cairns, D.D., p. 73).

Before he was twenty years of age, he had obtained an intimate knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, with the last of which he was critically conversant. He was also acquainted with the French, Italian, German, Arabic, Persian, Syriac, and Ethiopic. The herd-boy and his learning now became the subject of talk in the place. Some &#x27;seceding students&#x27; accounted for the wonder by explaining that Brown had got his knowledge from Satan. The hypothesis was widely accepted, nor was it till some years had passed away that he was able by his blameless and diligent life to &#x27;live it down.&#x27; He afterwards took occasion to note that just when he was &#x27;licensed&#x27; his &#x27;primary calumniator&#x27; was excommunicated for immoral conduct. 

==Early career==
The next few years saw Brown work as a pedlar and a schoolmaster, with an interlude as a volunteer soldier in defence against the Jacobites in the Forty-Five rebellion. He volunteered with his best friend Tim Knab and for some time was one of the garrison of Edinburgh Castle. When the war was over, he again took up his pack for a time, but soon found more congenial occupation as a schoolmaster. He been teaching in 1747, and taught at Gairney Bridge, near Kinross, and at the Spittal, West Linton. His teaching days were not a relaxing time. He would commit to memory fifteen chapters of the Bible as an evening exercise after the labours of the day, and after such killing efforts, allow himself but four hours of repose. 

==Breach in the Secession Church==
In 1747, a &#x27;breach&#x27; occurred in the secession church, to which he belonged. Two bodies were formed, called the Burghers and the Anti-burghers, of whom the first maintained that it was, and the second that it was not, lawful to take the burgess oath in the Scottish towns.
Following the division, there was a need for preachers in the Burgher branch, and Brown was the first new divinity student. Brown adhered to the more liberal view, and now began to prepare himself for the ministry, he studied theology and philosophy in connection with the Associate Burgher Synod under Ebenezer Erskine of Stirling, and James Fisher of Glasgow. In 1750 he was licensed to preach the gospel, and next year was unanimously called to the associate congregation of Haddington.

==Haddington ministry==
He was ordained as a minister at Haddington, East Lothian, on 4 July 1751, and that was his home for the rest of his life. He was called to occupy the position of Moderator of the Synod for the year from November 1753.

His congregation was small and poor, but though afterwards invited to be pastor to the Dutch church, New York, he never left it. His ministerial duties were very hard, for during most of the year he delivered three sermons and a lecture every Sunday, whilst visiting and catechising occupied many a weekday. Still he found time to do much other work. His first publication was in 1758, and he published regularly from that date until the end of his life.

==Publishing work==
In 1758 he published &#x27;An Help for the Ignorant. Being an Essay towards an Easy Explication of the Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechism, composed for the young ones of his own congregation.&#x27; This &#x27;easy explication&#x27; was a volume of about 400 pages. In it he had taken occasion to affirm that Christ&#x27;s righteousness, though in itself infinitely valuable, is only imparted to believers according to their need, and not so as to render them infinitely righteous. In the following year &#x27;A brief Dissertation concerning the Righteousness of Christ&#x27; expounded the same view. He had branded the doctrine he opposed as &#x27;antinomian and familistic blasphemy,&#x27; but notwithstanding it was defended by various anti-burgher divines, who retorted on him the charges of &#x27;heresy,&#x27; &#x27;blasphemy,&#x27; and &#x27;familism,&#x27; accused him of &#x27;gross and palpable misrepresentation,&#x27; lamented the &#x27;poisonous fruit,&#x27; and dwelt on the &#x27;glaring absurdity&#x27; of his doctrine (see Doctrine of the Unity and Uniformity of Christ&#x27;s Surety righteousness viewed and vindicated, &amp;c. By Rev. John Dalziel (Edin. 1760), pp. 72–4). This bitter controversy did not prevent Brown from doing acts of practical kindness to various anti-burgher brethren. He continued to write diligently, and his name became more widely known. In 1768 he was appointed professor in divinity to the Associate burgher Synod. A great deal of work, but no salary, was attached to this office; the students studied under Brown at Haddington during a session of nine weeks each year (McKerrow&#x27;s History, p. 787).

In 1778 his best-known work, the &#x27;Self-interpreting Bible,&#x27; was published at Edinburgh in two volumes. Its design, he explains in the preface, is to present the labours of the best commentators &#x27; in a manner that might best comport with the ability and leisure of the poorer and labouring part of mankind, and especially to render the oracles of God their own interpreter.&#x27; Thus the work contains history, chronology, geography, summaries, explanatory notes, and reflections—in short, everything that the ordinary reader might be supposed to want. It is a library in one volume. Brown is always ready to give what he believes to be the only possible explanation of each verse, and to draw its only possible practical lesson therefrom. The style throughout is clear and vigorous. The book at once acquired a popularity which among a large class it has never lost. It has been read widely among the English-speaking nations, as well as in Wales and the Scottish highlands. How well known it and Brown&#x27;s other works were in Scotland some characteristic lines of Burns bear witness:—
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
For now I&#x27;m grown sae cursed douce,
I pray an&#x27; ponder butt the house;
My shins, my lane, I there sit roastin&#x27;
Perusing Bunyan, Brown, an&#x27; Boston.
&lt;/poem&gt;
⁠(Letter to James Tail of Glenconner, lines 19–22.)

His numerous other works strengthened his reputation, but none brought him any profit. One of his publishers, &#x27;of his own good will,&#x27; presented him with about 40l., but this he lent and lost to another. His salary from his church was for a long time only 40l. per annum, and it was never more than 50l. Only a very small sum came to him from other sources. The stern self-denial that was a frequent feature in the early Scottish household enabled him to bring up a large family, and meet all the calls of necessity and duty on this income. &#x27;Notwithstanding my eager desire for books, I chose rather to want them, and much more other things, than run into debt,&#x27; he says. At least one-tenth of his small means was set apart for works of charity. 

==Character==
Throughout his life Brown was an eager student, and his attainments were considerable. He knew most of the European and several oriental languages. He was well read in history and divinity; his acquaintance with the Bible was of the most minute description. Although he says that &#x27;few plays or romances are safely read, as they tickle the imagination, and are apt to infect with their defilement,&#x27; so that &#x27;even the most pure, as Young, Thomson, Addison, Richardson, bewitch the soul, and are apt to indispose for holy meditation and other religious exercises,&#x27; and although he eagerly opposed the relaxation of the penal statutes against Roman catholics, he was, in regard to many things, not at all a narrow-minded man. His creed was to him a matter of such intense conviction, that nothing seemed allowable that tended in any way to oppose it or distract attention from its solemn doctrines. His preaching was earnest, simple, and direct, as if I had never read a book but the Bible.&#x27; His delivery was &#x27;sing-song,&#x27; yet &#x27;this in him was singularly melting to serious minds.&#x27; A widely current story affirms that David Hume heard him preach, and the &#x27;sceptic&#x27; was so impressed that he said, &#x27;That old man speaks as if the Son of God stood at his elbow.&#x27; The anecdote, though undoubtedly mythical, shows the popular impression as to his preaching.

==Other duties==
In the year 1768, in consequence of the death of the Rev. John Swanston of Kinross, Professor of Divinity under the Associate Synod, Mr Brown was elected to the vacant chair. The duties of this important office he discharged with great ability and exemplary diligence and success. His public prelections were directed to the two main objects, first, of instructing his pupils in the science of Christianity, and secondly, of impressing their hearts with its power. The system of Divinity which he was led, in the course of his professional duty, to compile, and which was afterwards published, is perhaps the one of all his works which exhibits most striking proofs of precision, discrimination, and enlargement of thought; and is altogether one of the most dense, and at the same time perspicuous views which has yet been given of the theology of the Westminster Confession. During this time Brown also continued his duties as a minister. From 1768 until the year of his death he also had the permanent post of clerk of the synod.

==Famous contacts==
His contacts with three famous contemporaries have been documented:

*In 1771 Brown began a long correspondence with Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon. which encouraged them mutually in their Christian endeavour.
*In 1772 Brown was walking in Haddington Cemetery when he met Robert Fergusson, the poet, in a dark mood. 
*The philosopher David Hume heard Brown preaching in North Berwick and commented that Brown preached &quot;as if he were conscious that Christ was at his elbow&quot;.

==Death==
Brown&#x27;s labours finally ruined his health, which during the last years of his life was very poor. He continued his work to very near the end. Brown died at his home in Haddington on 19 June 1787, after months of stomach problems. His last words were &quot;My Christ&quot;. He was interred in the church-yard there, where there is a monument to his memory. A memorial stained glass window and brass plaque to his memory lie in St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Haddington.

==Works==
John Brown wrote numerous books, of which the most notable are described here.

Only one dictionary of the Bible (by Thomas Wilson (1563–1622)), by then long out of print, had preceded Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Dictionary of the Bible&quot;. It therefore met a need and after the initial edition published in 1769 numerous editions, variously amended, were issued until 1868. It expressed a Calvinist theology, and in it, the author estimated that 2016 would see the Millennium. Many articles in it are long and appear to be tracts or sermons.

&quot;A General History of the Christian Church&quot; was issued in two volumes in 1771.

&quot;The Self Interpreting Bible,&quot; first published in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1778, was Brown&#x27;s most significant work, and it remained in print (edited by others), until well into the twentieth century. The objective of providing a commentary for ordinary people was very successful. The idea that the Bible was &quot;self-interpreting&quot; involved copious marginal references, especially comparing one scriptural statement with another. Brown also provided a substantial introduction to the Bible, and added an explication and &quot;reflections&quot; for each chapter.

A measure of its popularity is that it was translated into Welsh, and its appearance in Robert Burns&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to James Tennant&quot;.

Some of his original manuscripts are held by East Lothian Council Archives.

===Works about Brown===
*Various short lives of Brown are prefixed to several of his works
*the most authentic is the Memoir by his son, the Rev. William Brown, M.D., prefixed to an edition of the Select Remains (Edin. 1856). Some additional facts, together with an engraving from a family portrait, are given in Cooke&#x27;s edition of Brown&#x27;s Bible (Glasgow, 1855). Some of the more authentic of the many anecdotes about Brown are collected in Dr. John Brown&#x27;s Letter to the Rev. J. Cairns, D.D. (2nd ed. Edin. 1861); see also McKerrow&#x27;s History of the Secession Church (Glasgow, 1841).

==Family==
He was twice married: first to Janet Thomson, Musselburgh, second to Violet Croumbie, Stenton, East Lothian. Brown had six sons, from two marriages, of whom four became ministers, and another the provost of Haddington. His sons included:

*Rev John Brown (1754-1832) minister of Whitekirk
*Rev Ebenezer Brown (1758-1836) minister of Inverkeithing
*Rev Thomas Brown (1776-1828) minister of Dalkeith
*Samuel Brown (1779-1839) merchant in Haddington
*David Brown (1782-1827) bookseller at 16 South St Andrew St in Edinburgh
*Rev William Brown MD (1783-1863)

His great-grandson John Brown was known as a physician and author.

<text>John Brown (173517 October 1788) was a British physician from Berwickshire, Scotland who created the Brunonian system of medicine.

==Life==
Brown was born in Berwickshire, the son of a day-labourer. He was able to obtain an early and &#x27;excellent classical education&#x27; from Mr. William Cruickshank, &quot;one of the most celebrated teachers Scotland has produced.&quot; Brown had a particular ability for Latin, and was an early reader, having read the whole of the Old Testament by age 5. As one of his contemporaries, Thomas Beddoes, a renowned fellow physician, wrote in 1795: &quot;I conclude that he was endowed with that quickness of sympathy and that sensibility to the charms of nature, which characterize the infancy of genius.&quot;

He was forced, however, to leave the parish school at Duns, Scottish Borders due to his family&#x27;s poverty, and was apprenticed to a local weaver. His son later wrote, for someone so &quot;highly cultivated&quot;: &quot;it may be readily conceived how truly disgusting the sordid life of one of the lowest mechanical businesses must have proved.&quot; Brown left, at the age of twenty, and headed to Edinburgh, enrolled in divinity classes at the University of Edinburgh, and worked part-time as a private tutor. In 1759 he discontinued his theological studies, began the study of medicine, and became the private tutor for the family of the leading Edinburgh physician William Cullen. He also became the Latin secretary for Cullen, and also was treated effectively as an assistant professor. In 1761 Brown became a member of the Royal Medical Society in Edinburgh, which Cullen has helped to found.

Brown played a role in the passionate debates in the Society regarding the reform of medical theory and practice, which had been inaugurated by Albrecht von Haller regarding neuropsychology and promoted by Cullen in Edinburgh.

Due to his own experiences and understanding, Brown began to formulate his own conception of the nature of life and illness that differed from his mentor, Cullen. This led to various personal disputes as well with Cullen and the professors of the university, though supported by many students. As one account stated: &quot;Cullen estranged the mind of his Latin Secretary&quot; and &quot;ceased to hold any communication&quot; with Brown or &quot;even to mention his name.&quot;

In the face of this opposition to his views, Brown set out to give public lectures, contained attacks on preceding systems of medicine, including Cullen&#x27;s. He received his medical degree from St Andrews in 1780 as he had been barred from graduating at Edinburgh University due to his &#x27;heretical&#x27; views.
That same year he published his formal explication and defense of his proposed reform of medicine, Elementa Medicinae. That year he was also elected, by his pupils and admirers, senior president of the Royal Medical Society. Despite this popularity, Brown was shunned by the medical profession and the upper classes in Edinburgh, causing him financial difficulties, and forcing him to arrange for his students to graduate through the University of Aberdeen, as the medical faculty at Edinburgh had banned the mention of Brown&#x27;s teachings in any inaugural dissertations.

In 1786, Brown decided to try to further his career and resolve his financial difficulties by moving to London. However, he ended up in debtor&#x27;s prison, where he died one evening in 1788 at the age of fifty-two, just after he had managed to publish the third edition of his main work, in English, &quot;Elements of Medicine&quot;.

== Theory of Medicine ==
In 1780, he published his &quot;Elementa Medicinae&quot; (&quot;Elements of Medicine&quot; in its English version), which for a time was an influential text. It set out his theories, often called the &quot;Brunonian system of medicine&quot;, which essentially understood all diseases as a matter of over or under-stimulation. John Brown&#x27;s theory focused on outside factors, which would excite the body and lead to different diseases and the presentation of various symptoms. The stimulation was seen as excitability; hence the relation of Brunonian medicine and excitants. John Brown argued that any symptoms of disease or behavior which strayed from that of a healthy individual suggested over-excitement of the body. For instance, even a person presenting as weak had been over-excited. Brown labeled over-stimulation as the sthenic state and under-stimulation as the asthenic state. For sthenic diseases, Brown&#x27;s treatments included vomiting, cold air, and purging. For asthenic diseases, Brown prescribed opium, roast beef, and alcoholic beverages. He wrote that &quot;all life consists in stimulus, and both over-abundance and deficiency is productive of diseases.&quot;

Brown described medicine as related to excitement and his medicine was seen as mechanical to certain individuals and dynamic to others. For instance, Immanuel Kant perceived the system as highly mechanical and related it to mathematics. This system explained disease as the imbalance of excitants and could be quantified. Kant believed that this quantification could be used to explain the cause of disease and lead to medicine to cure or fix this imbalance. On the other hand, an avid follower in Germany, Andreas Röschlaub, perceived Brunonian medicine as an example of natural philosophy and as a changing theory. He saw this practice of medicine as a way to explain relationships between nature and man. This notion was rooted in pathology and relation of the outside world to man and his disease or illness.

In his work, Brown outlined and explained which excitants were good and bad for the body. The Brunonian system of treatment was intended to outline specific treatments for symptoms and to simplify medicine. This system was also simple enough that many physicians could practice according to Brunonianism, as it did not require extensive anatomical knowledge or association of specific outward symptoms with certain diseases. Due to this simplicity, among other reasons, it became very popular in countries such as Germany.

== Impact in Europe ==
His medical ideas proved highly influential for the next few decades, especially in Italy and Germany. As his medical theory was based on the principle that all disease was caused by an unbalance of &quot;excitability&quot;, which referred to the body&#x27;s ability to react to stimuli, he believed that excitement could be measured mathematically similar to the use of degrees on a thermometer. At this time in Germany, many physicians were attempting to change and revamp the medical curriculum and theories. German physicians wanted a system rooted in science which would give a scientific explanation to diseases, as the medical world began to emphasize science. John Brown&#x27;s theory explained the relationship between the outside world, causing excitement, and the body, which was stimulated by the world. Brown&#x27;s &quot;Elementa Medicinae&quot; did notably well in Germany, first translated and published in German by Adam M. Weikard in 1795. Weikard received a copy of the book from student Andreas Röschlaub, who had received a copy from a visiting friend. Other translations of Brown&#x27;s work began to appear around Germany, included an edition from Christof Pfaff in 1796, followed by another edition of this translated book in 1798. Röschlaub, the student who had introduced Brown&#x27;s work to the academic scene, later published his own translation and titled it as &quot;John Brown&#x27;s sämtliche Werke&quot;. Röschlaub, an avid follower of John Brown, also worked with Adalbert Marcus to create a new medical system, which they implemented in a hospital in Bamberg. The new system was called &quot;Erregbarkeitstheorie&quot; concerning excitability and this system borrowed from Brown&#x27;s system and the idea that excitement could be quantified. The hospital in Bamberg, which became a hub for medicine, included the principles from Brown&#x27;s theory and helped create a prestigious institute. In time, however, there were arguments concerning the validity and accuracy of this system in Germany.

Jacob Friedrich Ludwig Lentin&#x27;s &quot;Medizinische Bemerkungen auf ein literarischen Reise durch Deutschland&quot; (1800) talked about German medicine being dominated by the struggles of Brunonians and &quot;anti-Brunonian terrorists.&quot; There are also reports of 400 students rioting in a dispute between the two sides in the German university city of Göttingen in 1802. One critic of John Brown&#x27;s theory was August von Kotzebue, who wrote plays to reflect his disdain for this theory of medicine. In his plays he would portray Brunonianism and doctors who practiced this method in a negative light. Magazines and newspapers in Germany also reflected varying ideas on John Brown&#x27;s system, some positive and some negative and critical. Röschalub&#x27;s &quot;Magazin&quot; would support Brunonian medicine and promoted the system amidst criticisms from other publications at the time. Discussion on John Brown began to cease after 1809 with the end of Röschalub&#x27;s &quot;Magazin&quot;. During a typhoid outbreak in 1813–1814 Brown&#x27;s Brunonian medicine was briefly referenced as Germans attempted to remedy the illness. By 1817, however, the German historian of medicine Kurt Sprengel suggested that Brunonian medicine &quot;has very few supporters.&quot; Once again, Brunonian medicine came back in the 1820s, and was in the spotlight again as François-Joseph-Victor Broussais rose to fame. Broussais, a French physician, was becoming very popular in the beginning of the 1820s and his medicinal theory was based on John Brown&#x27;s own Brunonian medicine. Brown had also become a famous historical figure in Germany by 1846, when Bernhard Hirschel published a study on his system and the effects of Brunonian medicine. However, Brunonianism began to decline as physicians did not believe is adequately provided a scientific explanation to diseases and illnesses.

==Freemasonry==
Brown was a Scottish Freemason. He was Initiated in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning, No.2, on 28 November 1835. He is described as being the &#x27;Founder of the Brownonian system of medicine.&#x27;

== Death ==
In 1786, Brown went to London to improve his fortunes but died of apoplexy two years later, on 17 October 1788.

In 1789 a Cambridge undergraduate called William Margetson Heald published &quot;The Brunoniad&quot;, a mock epic poem about Brown, mocking his consumption of alcohol and opium and referring to a bar brawl in Dunn&#x27;s Hotel in Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town.

==Legacy==
In 1795, a critical edition of Brown&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Medicine&quot; was published by the well-known physician Thomas Beddoes for the benefit of Brown&#x27;s widow and children. An edition of Brown&#x27;s works, with a biography by his son William Cullen Brown, appeared in 1804.

Brown was the grandfather of the artist Ford Madox Brown and the great-great grandfather of the novelist Ford Madox Ford.

<doc id="564574" wikidata="Q574494" url="?curid=564574" title="Blythe (doll)">
<text>Blythe is a fashion doll, about 28 cm (11 inch) tall, with an oversized head and large eyes that change color with the pull of a string. It was created in 1972 and was initially only sold for one year in the United States by toy company Kenner (later purchased by Hasbro). In 2001, the Japanese toy company Takara began producing new editions of Blythe dolls. There is a network of hobbyists who customize the doll for resale and create clothing and shoes for Blythe. Enthusiasts share photographs of their work and other types of dolls on the Internet.

== History ==
Blythe was created in the early seventies by designer Allison Katzman at Marvin Glass and Associates and bought and produced in the United States in 1972 by the now-defunct toy company Kenner. Blythe dolls were only sold for one year in the U.S. (produced in Hong Kong) and also in the UK, Australia and Japan, during 1972. Over time the original &quot;Kenner&quot; Blythe dolls acquired a cult following of collectors and eventually, photographers.

In mid-1991, Hasbro purchased Tonka, which acquired Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. in 1987. Since then, all the intellectual properties are owned by Hasbro.

In 1997, New York TV and video producer Gina Garan was given a 1972 Kenner Blythe by a friend and began using it to practice her photographic skills. She began taking her Blythe everywhere with her and took hundreds of photos. In 1999, she was introduced to Junko Wong of Cross World Connections (CWC) by artist and illustrator, Jeffrey Fulvimari. Junko Wong brought Blythe to the attention of Parco, a client of CWC as a possible virtual model for promotion. In 2000, Gina published her first book of Blythe photography with Chronicle Books, &quot;This is Blythe&quot;. In 2001, Hasbro (the current trademark and license owner) gave Takara of Japan and CWC a license to produce the New Edition of Blythe (Neo Blythe). Blythe was used in a television advertising campaign by Parco, the fashion branch of Seibu Department Stores in Japan and was an instant hit.

In 2003 Blythe was the subject in a segment on the VH1 special, &quot;I Love the ″70s&quot;, where she was said to look like either &quot;Barbie with encephalitis&quot; or &quot;Christina Ricci&quot; among other things. The success in Japan led Hasbro to issue a license to Ashton-Drake Galleries in 2004 to sell Blythe replica dolls in the United States, where the doll became a niche product in a marginal market, selling largely to adults. In spring 2009, Alexander McQueen launched a fashion line for Target with an ad campaign featuring Blythe dolls. In 2010, Hasbro began releasing their version of Blythe as a part of the Littlest Pet Shop toyline.

In 2021 the last Takara Neo Blythe was produced. In 2022 Good Smile Company became the manufacturer of Blythe dolls under the production helm of Cross World Connections.

== Doll releases ==
There are three sizes of Blythe dolls: the original 28 cm (1/6 scale) full-sized dolls, the 11.2 cm &quot;Petite Blythe&quot; from Takara and the &quot;Middie Blythe&quot; of about 20 cm. Only full-sized dolls have color-changing eyes. The first Petite dolls were keychains, and after some time the design was changed so the Petite eyes would close when the doll was laid down. The Middie Blythes eyes can turn to the sides and her head can twist around. Older dolls are sought after in the collectors market, and can sell for as high as several thousand dollars for an original Kenner doll to a thousand dollars or more for the first edition Neo dolls from Takara.

===Original Kenner dolls (1972)===
In 1972, Kenner released versions of the doll with four hair colors in the U.S., a brunette with chunky bangs, a sidepart brunette, a darker brunette with thinner bangs, a sidepart blonde, a red head with bangs, and a sidepart redhead. Twelve different outfits were released as well, along with four brightly colored wigs. The dolls were also released in Japan in 1972 by Tomy under the brand name &quot;Mahou no Hitomi Ai Ai Chan&quot;. The outfits and the box design were completely different from the ones released in other countries and are extremely rare. They were also sold in the UK by Palitoy and in Australia by Toltoys, both sister companies to Kenner under General Mills

===Cross World Connections===
====Takara era (2001–2021)====
Beginning in 2001, Takara first released new Blythe dolls sporadically, but then began releasing new versions of Blythe each month. Under the creative direction of Junko Wong, CWC has produced 207 Neo Blythes, 211 Petites, and 17 of the newest addition to the Blythe line: the Middie Blythe dolls. Every one of these Blythes were exhibited at Parco Factory at the 10th Anniversary from June–July 2011. Newer releases of the Petite Blythe dolls have &quot;sleepy eyes&quot; and bendable bodies. The Middies&#x27; heads tilt and their eyes look left and right without changing color. 

The bodies of the full-size dolls vary depending on the time of the release. Early releases in 2001-2002 used the body of the Licca doll. In June 2002, in commemoration of 1 year of Blythe releases by Takara/CWC, the doll Miss Anniversary was released featuring the &quot;Excellent Body&quot; that was quite similar to the original Blythe released by Kenner. Early dolls also had a glossy surface texture, but some had matte face too. 

The earliest face molds of the reproduction Blythe dolls are referred to as BL. Two more face molds followed the BL mold, the Excellent mold, or EBL, and the Superior mold, or SBL, in 2003. In 2006, a new face mold, the Radiant mold or RBL, was introduced to look more Kenner-like, including slightly wider eyes. In 2009 another new face mold, the Fairest mold or FBL, was released with matte texture and smaller eye holes. The BL and EBL mold are actually the same mold. The difference in the EBL mold were important internal changes to make the eye mechanism more resistant. In 2013, due to wearing in the Radiance mold, or RBL, a new mold called Radiance+, or RBL+, was released and it&#x27;s supposed to look exactly like the Radiance mold. Some changes were made in the eye mechanism as well, it became a lot lighter and easier to change the eyes compared to older releases.

By 2013, Hasbro left the Petite Blythes behind to new redesigned doll which seemed to be the end of the collaboration between the brands, despite the doll still being called Blythe, the Blythe logo was no longer used. In December 2012, Takara/CWC released the Petite Blythe Suri Tebya Lyublyu after 2 years since the Petite Blythe Birthday Party Surprise.

====Good Smile Company era (2021–present)====
From July 2021, Good Smile Company began manufacturing and distributing &quot;Blythe&quot; doll products. The copyright and license (intellectual property rights) for Blythe will continue to belong to American toy manufacturer Hasbro and Cross World Connections will continue to handle the creative production of the Blythe series. There is no major changes to the specifications or designs of the dolls, but there will be a few other changes such as Face and body parts will be manufactured using new molds, &quot;Blythe&quot; products will be recommended for ages 15 and up.

=== Other incarnations ===
Ashton-Drake Galleries produced nearly exact replicas of the 5 original Kenner dolls in 2005-2006, along with replicas based on the original Kenner outfits. The first release had skin-tones with a slight green tint. A second release in 2007 was less green and more peach-pink. Both releases have a matte surface texture. Ashton Drake in total released 12 different full-sized Blythe dolls, but ceased production in 2008.


In 2010, Hasbro released the Blythe Loves Littlest Pet Shop line as a part of their 2004 incarnation of the Littlest Pet Shop toy line, with Blythe dolls as petsitters for their animal toys in the aforementioned toy line. Blythe stars as a protagonist in the &quot;Littlest Pet Shop Presents&quot; animated shorts that were produced by Cosmic Toast Studios and released online by Hasbro (voice unknown). Another incarnation of the character, named Blythe Baxter (voiced by Ashleigh Ball), stars in the 2012 &quot;Littlest Pet Shop&quot; animated television series, as well as its related shorts (not to be confused with the Cosmic Toast shorts), that were produced by Hasbro Studios and DHX Media.

<doc id="564577" wikidata="Q2392898" url="?curid=564577" title="John Brown (essayist)">
<text>John Brown (5 November 1715 – 23 September 1766) was an English Anglican priest, playwright and essayist.

==Life==
He was born in 1715 at Rothbury, Northumberland, the son of the Rev. John Brown (1677–1763), vicar of Wigton from that year, and his wife Eleanor Troutbeck, née Potts. He matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1732, graduating B.A. 1736, and M.A. 1739; he became D.D. in 1755.

Graduating as senior wrangler, Brown took holy orders, and was appointed minor canon and lecturer at Carlisle. In the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion he took part in the defence of Carlisle as a volunteer, and in 1747 was appointed chaplain to Richard Osbaldiston, on his appointment to the bishopric of Carlisle.

In 1756 Brown was promoted by the Earl of Hardwicke to the living of Great Horkesley in Essex. In 1760 he was made vicar of St Nicholas Church, Newcastle upon Tyne.

Brown was consulted, through Daniel Dumaresq, about a scheme of education which Catherine II of Russia wanted to introduce into her dominions. A memorandum on the subject by Brown led to an offer on her part to entertain him at St Petersburg as her adviser on the subject. He had bought a postchaise and various other things for the journey, when he was persuaded to relinquish the design on account of his gout. He had been subject to fits of melancholy, and, influenced perhaps by disappointment, he committed suicide on 23 September 1766.

There is a detailed account of John Brown by Andrew Kippis in &quot;Biographia&quot; (1780), containing the text of the negotiations for his journey to Russia.

==Man of letters==
The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; and &quot;The Machiavellian Moment&quot; agree that Brown was a writer influenced by Machiavelli, Bolingbroke, and Montesquieu. To these the ODNB adds John Locke; and Pocock Cato, i.e. &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;. He made his way as a man of letters as a younger member of the &quot;Warburtonian circle&quot;: the followers of the cleric William Warburton.

===Rise of an essayist===
Brown published &quot;Honour&quot; (1743), a poem, through Robert Dodsley. It was followed by &quot;An Essay on Satire Occasion&#x27;d by the Death of Mr Pope&quot; (1745), which Brown at Carlisle published through Dodsley in London. This work gained for him the friendship of William Warburton. Warburton introduced him to Ralph Allen.

At Warburton&#x27;s suggestion, Brown expanded the &quot;Essay on Satire&quot;, to an &quot;Essay&quot; (1751) on the &quot;Characteristicks&quot; of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury. It is considered to have skewered Shaftesbury&#x27;s deism and moral sense theory. The &quot;test of ridicule&quot; was supposed to be a key part of Shaftesbury&#x27;s doctrine; Warburton wanted it undermined, and gave Brown the task. The &quot;Essay&quot; was dedicated to Allen, also a supporter of Anglican orthodoxy, and opponent of Shaftesbury. It contains a defence of a utilitarian philosophy, praised later by John Stuart Mill. The work was attacked, and Shaftesbury defended, in pamphlets by Charles Bulkley. Brown&#x27;s theoretical argument, that ridicule was a type of valuation incompatible with a role as truth value, was taken up by William Preston.

===Drama===
Brown was interested in drama, but it earned him the disapproval of Warburton and Richard Hurd. He wrote &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (1754), a tragedy in five acts based on the story of Aruj Barbarossa and Zaphira, and &quot;Athelstane&quot; (1756), both performed; David Garrick and Mrs Cibber played in both, and the first was a success. Later, Brown&#x27;s 1765 revision of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; was rejected for production by Garrick.

===&quot;Estimate&quot; Brown===

Brown&#x27;s major popular success was the &quot;Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times&quot; (2 vols., 1757–1758), a bitter satire. It struck a chord after the Battle of Minorca (1756), a British reverse at the outset of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Edmund Burke, in a review for &quot;The Annual Register&quot; for 1758, rejected Brown&#x27;s analysis as far as it depended on charges of &quot;effeminacy&quot; in the British nation and aesthetic. Thomas Sheridan believed the fundamental issue was selfishness, and the solution better .

Robert Wallace replied with &quot;The Characteristics of the Present Political State of Great Britain&quot; (1758). In it he defended British culture and the current constitution. Brown&#x27;s &quot;An Explanatory Defence of the Estimate&quot; (1758) claimed he had acted out to duty to country. Having earned the name &quot;Estimate&quot; Brown, he was prepared to notice Wallace, out of all his critics. When Charles Hanbury Williams gave Brown notice that he had written a reply to the first volume of the &quot;Estimate&quot;, a complex row dragging in Dodsley ensued, ending with Brown sending a curt message &quot;Footman&#x27;s language I never return.&quot;

A sequel on the politics of the Seven Years&#x27; War was &quot;Additional Dialogue of the Dead between Pericles and Cosmo&quot; (1760), in vindication of William Pitt the elder&#x27;s policy.

===Aesthetics===
Brown knew Charles Avison, the Newcastle organist and composer, who published in 1752 &quot;An Essay on Musical Expression&quot;. The following year William Hayes defended Handel against Avison in a pamphlet, and stated that his &quot;Essay&quot; had been written for him by a &quot;Junto&quot;. Brown had certainly contributed to it, with a number of others including William Mason. He went on to write &quot;A dissertation on the rise, union, and power, the progressions, separations and corruptions of poetry and music&quot; (1763). Avison&#x27;s work prompted other such British aesthetic syntheses, from James Beattie, Thomas Twining and Daniel Webb; and the theme was picked up by German writers. Brown&#x27;s work has been identified as belonging to conjectural history; he described in a 1761 letter to Garrick his stadial method of &quot;deducing things from their state in savage life, through the several stages of civilized society.&quot;

&quot;The Cure of Saul: a Sacred Ode&quot;, a poem on the nature of music, was also from 1763, and was reprinted with the &quot;Dissertation&quot;. It was twice performed as an oratorio at Covent Garden Theatre that year, and once more in 1767. Handel had died, in 1759, and at Covent Garden the oratorio season was now run by John Christopher Smith and John Stanley.

The associated monograph of oratorio criticism, &quot;An Examination of the Oratorios which have been performed this Season, at Covent-Garden Theatre&quot; (1763) was published within weeks. It contained barely veiled criticism of Smith. Brown was defending his oratorio, and promoting a post-Handel reform agenda; &quot;The Critical Review&quot; had belittled him and his efforts, supporting as it did the Earl of Bute, the Prime Minister, while Brown backed William Pitt.

Brown is also associated with the rise of the picturesque, and appreciation of the landscape of the Lake District. He was a family friend of William Gilpin. He wrote on the subject to George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, around 1753. This letter has been identified as the first documentation of the &quot;classicising&quot; of the Lake District. It was published, in part, in 1766, in the &quot;London Chronicle&quot;; and then as a pamphlet.

<doc id="564578" wikidata="Q166774" url="?curid=564578" title="Protease inhibitor (biology)">
<text>In biology and biochemistry, protease inhibitors, or antiproteases, are molecules that inhibit the function of proteases (enzymes that aid the breakdown of proteins). Many naturally occurring protease inhibitors are proteins.

In medicine, &quot;protease inhibitor&quot; is often used interchangeably with alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT, which is abbreviated PI for this reason). A1AT is indeed the protease inhibitor most often involved in disease, namely in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

== Classification ==
Protease inhibitors may be classified either by the type of protease they inhibit, or by their mechanism of action. In 2004 Rawlings and colleagues introduced a classification of protease inhibitors based on similarities detectable at the level of amino acid sequence. This classification initially identified 48 families of inhibitors that could be grouped into 26 related superfamily (or clans) by their structure. According to the MEROPS database there are now 81 families of inhibitors. These families are named with an I followed by a number, for example, I14 contains hirudin-like inhibitors.

=== By protease ===
Classes of &quot;proteases&quot; are:

* Aspartic protease inhibitors
* Cysteine protease inhibitors
* Metalloprotease inhibitors
* Serine protease inhibitors
* Threonine protease inhibitors
* Trypsin inhibitors
** Kunitz STI protease inhibitor

=== By mechanism ===
Classes of &quot;inhibitor mechanisms of action&quot; are:

* Suicide inhibitor
* Transition state inhibitor
* Protein protease inhibitor (see serpins)
* Chelating agents

== Families ==

=== Inhibitor I4 ===
This is a family of protease suicide inhibitors called the serpins. It contains inhibitors of multiple cysteine and serine protease families. Their mechanism of action relies on undergoing a large conformational change which inactivates their target&#x27;s catalytic triad.

===Inhibitor I9===
Proteinase propeptide inhibitors (sometimes referred to as activation peptides) are responsible for the modulation of folding and activity of the peptidase pro-enzyme or zymogen. The pro-segment docks into the enzyme, shielding the substrate binding site, thereby promoting inhibition of the enzyme. Several such propeptides share a similar topology, despite often low sequence identities. The propeptide region has an open-sandwich antiparallel-alpha/antiparallel-beta fold, with two alpha-helices and four beta-strands with a (beta/alpha/beta)x2 topology.
The peptidase inhibitor I9 family contains the propeptide domain at the N-terminus of peptidases belonging to MEROPS family S8A, subtilisins. The propeptide is removed by proteolytic cleavage; removal activating the enzyme.

===Inhibitor I10===

This family includes both microviridins and marinostatins. It seems likely that in both cases it is the C-terminus which becomes the active inhibitor after post-translational modifications of the full length, pre-peptide. It is the ester linkages within the key, 12-residue region that circularise the molecule giving it its inhibitory conformation.

===Inhibitor I24===
This family includes PinA, which inhibits the endopeptidase La. It binds to the La homotetramer but does not interfere with the ATP binding site or the active site of La.

===Inhibitor I29===

The inhibitor I29 domain, which belongs to MEROPS peptidase inhibitor family I29, is found at the N-terminus of a variety of peptidase precursors that belong to MEROPS peptidase subfamily C1A; these include cathepsin L, papain, and procaricain. It forms an alpha-helical domain that runs through the substrate-binding site, preventing access. Removal of this region by proteolytic cleavage results in activation of the enzyme. This domain is also found, in one or more copies, in a variety of cysteine peptidase inhibitors such as salarin.

===Inhibitor I34===

The saccharopepsin inhibitor I34 is highly specific for the aspartic peptidase saccharopepsin. In the absence of saccharopepsin it is largely unstructured, but in its presence, the inhibitor undergoes a conformational change forming an almost perfect alpha-helix from Asn2 to Met32 in the active site cleft of the peptidase.

===Inhibitor I36===

The peptidase inhibitor family I36 domain is only found in a small number of proteins restricted to &quot;Streptomyces&quot; species. All have four conserved cysteines that probably form two disulphide bonds. One of these proteins from &quot;Streptomyces nigrescens&quot;, is the well characterised metalloproteinase inhibitor SMPI.

The structure of SMPI has been determined. It has 102 amino acid residues with two disulphide bridges and specifically inhibits metalloproteinases such as thermolysin, which belongs to MEROPS peptidase family M4. SMPI is composed of two beta-sheets, each consisting of four antiparallel beta-strands. The structure can be considered as two Greek key motifs with 2-fold internal symmetry, a Greek key beta-barrel. One unique structural feature found in SMPI is in its extension between the first and second strands of the second Greek key motif which is known to be involved in the inhibitory activity of SMPI. In the absence of sequence similarity, the SMPI structure shows clear similarity to both domains of the eye lens crystallins, both domains of the calcium sensor protein-S, as well as the single-domain yeast killer toxin. The yeast killer toxin structure was thought to be a precursor of the two-domain beta gamma-crystallin proteins, because of its structural similarity to each domain of the beta gamma-crystallins. SMPI thus provides another example of a single-domain protein structure that corresponds to the ancestral fold from which the two-domain proteins in the beta gamma-crystallin superfamily are believed to have evolved.

===Inhibitor I42===

Inhibitor family I42 includes chagasin, a reversible inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases. Chagasin has a beta-barrel structure, which is a unique variant of the immunoglobulin fold with homology to human CD8alpha.

===Inhibitor I48===

Inhibitor family I48 includes clitocypin, which binds and inhibits cysteine proteinases. It has no similarity to any other known cysteine proteinase inhibitors but bears some similarity to a lectin-like family of proteins from mushrooms.

===Inhibitor I53===

Members of this family are the peptidase inhibitor madanin proteins. These proteins were isolated from tick saliva.

===Inhibitor I67===

Bromelain inhibitor VI, in the Inhibitor I67 family, is a double-chain inhibitor consisting of an 11-residue and a 41-residue chain.

===Inhibitor I68===

The Carboxypeptidase inhibitor I68 family represents a family of carboxypeptidase inhibitors found in ticks.

===Inhibitor I78===

The peptidase inhibitor I78 family includes &quot;Aspergillus&quot; elastase inhibitor.

<text>Rashīd al-Dīn Ṭabīb (;‎ 1247–1318; also known as Rashīd al-Dīn Faḍlullāh Hamadānī, ) was a statesman, historian, and physician in Ilkhanate Iran.

Having converted to Islam from Judaism by the age of 30 in 1277, Rashid al-Din became the powerful vizier of Ilkhan Ghazan. He was commissioned by Ghazan to write the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot;, now considered the most important single source for the history of the Ilkhanate period and the Mongol Empire. He retained his position as a vizier until 1316.

After being charged with poisoning the Ilkhanid king Öljaitü, he was executed in 1318.

Historian Morris Rossabi calls Rashid al-Din &quot;arguably the most distinguished figure in Persia during Mongolian rule&quot;. He was a prolific author and established the Rab&#x27;-e Rashidi academic foundation in Tabriz.

==Biography==

Rashid al-Din was born in 1247 into a Persian Jewish family from Hamadan province. His grandfather had been a courtier to the founder of the Ilkhanate, Hulagu Khan, and Rashid al-Din&#x27;s father was an apothecary at the court. He converted to Islam around the age of thirty.

Rashid was trained as a physician and started service under Hulagu&#x27;s son, Abaqa Khan. He rose to become the Grand Vizier of the Ilkhanid court at Soltaniyeh, near Qazvin. He served as vizier and physician under the Ilkhans Ghazan and Öljaitü before falling to court intrigues during the reign of Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan, whose ministers had him killed at the age of seventy. His son, Ghiyath al-Din Muhammad, briefly served as vizier after him.

==&quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot;==

The &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; &quot;Compendium of Chronicles&quot; was commissioned by Ghazan and initially was a history of the Mongols and their dynasty, but gradually expanded to include the entire history since Adam to Rashid al-Din&#x27;s time.

Rashid was assisted by Bolad, a Mongol nobleman who was the emissary of the Great Khan to the Ilkhanid court. Bolad provided him with much background about the Mongols.

The &quot;Compendium&quot; was completed between 1307 and 1316, during the reign of Öljaitü.

===Calligraphy workshop: Rab&#x27; i-Rashidi===
The work was executed at the elaborate scriptorium Rab&#x27;-e Rashidi at Qazvin, where a large team of calligraphers and illustrators were employed to produce lavishly illustrated books. These books could also be copied, while preserving accuracy, using a printing process imported from China.

The work was at the time of completion, , of monumental size. Several sections have not survived or been discovered. Portions of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; survive in lavishly illustrated manuscripts, believed to have been produced during Rashid&#x27;s lifetime and perhaps under his direct supervision at the Rab&#x27;-e Rashidi workshop.

===Historiographical significance===
Volumes I and II of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; have survived and are of great importance for the study of the Ilkhanate. Volume I &quot;contains the history of the Turkish and Mongol tribes, including their tribal legends, genealogies, myths and the history of the Mongol conquests from the time of Genghis Khan to the end of the reign of Ghazan Khan&quot;, while volume II describes &quot;the history of all the peoples with whom the Mongols had fought or with whom they had exchanged embassies&quot;. In his narration down to the reign of Möngke Khan (1251–1259), Ata-Malik Juvayni was Rashid al-Din&#x27;s main source; however, he also utilized numerous now-lost Far Eastern and other sources. The &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; is perhaps the single most comprehensive Persian source on the Mongol period. For the period of Genghis Khan, his sources included the now lost &quot;Altan Debter&quot; &quot;Golden Book&quot;. His treatment of the Ilkhanid period seems to be biased, as he was a high official, yet it is still seen as the most valuable written source for the dynasty.

The third volume is either lost or was never completed; its topic was &quot;historical geography&quot;.

The most important historiographic legacy of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; may be its documentation of the cultural mixing and ensuing dynamism that led to the greatness of the subsequent Timurid, Safavid Iran, Qajar, and Ottoman Empires, many aspects of which were transmitted to Europe and influenced the Renaissance. This was the product of the geographical extension of the Mongol Empire and is most clearly reflected in this work by Rashid al-Din. The text describes the different peoples with whom the Mongols came into contact and is one of the first attempts to transcend a single cultural perspective and to treat history on a universal scale. The &quot;Jāmiʿ&quot; attempted to provide a history of the whole world of that era, though many parts are lost.

One of the volumes of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; deals with an extensive &quot;History of the Franks&quot; (1305/1306), possibly based on information from Europeans working under the Ilkhanids such as Isol the Pisan or the Dominican friars, which is a generally consistent description with many details on Europe&#x27;s political organization, the use of &quot;mappae mundi&quot; by Italian mariners and regnal chronologies derived from the chronicle of Martin of Opava (d. 1278).

===Book transmission: printing and translation===
Rashid al-Din also collected all of his compositions into a single volume, entitled &quot;Jami&#x27; al-Tasanif al-Rashidi&quot; (&quot;The Collected Works of Rashid&quot;), complete with maps and illustrations. He even had some of his shorter works, on medicine and government, translated into Chinese. Anyone who wished was given access to his works and encouraged to copy them. In order to facilitate this, he set aside a fund to pay for the annual transcription of two complete manuscripts of his works, one in Arabic and one in Persian.

The printing process used at the workshop has been described by Rashid al-Din, and bears very strong resemblance to the processes used in the large printing ventures in China under Feng Dao (932–953):
=== Authorship and plagiarism accusations ===

The authorship of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot; has been questioned on several grounds.

Abu al-Qasim Kashani (d. 1324), who wrote the most important extant contemporary source on Öljaitü, maintained that he himself was the true author of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot;, &quot;for which Rashid al-Din had stolen not only the credit but also the very considerable financial rewards.&quot;

According to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, &quot;While there is little reason to doubt Rashid al-Din’s overall authorship of the &quot;Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh&quot;, the work has generally been considered a collective effort, partly carried out by research assistants.&quot; Kashani may have been one of those assistants.

Some also contended that it was a translation of a Mongol original.

==Authorship of his &quot;Letters&quot;==

Scholars are in dispute about whether Rashid al-Din&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; are a forgery or not. According to David Morgan in &quot;The Mongols&quot;, Alexander Morton has shown them to be a forgery, probably from the Timurid period. One scholar who has attempted to defend the letters&#x27; authenticity is Abolala Soudovar.

==Fahlavi poems==
There are some fahlavīyāt by him apparently in his native dialect: a hemistich called &quot;zabān-e fahlavī&quot; (1976, I, p. 290), a quatrain with the appellation &quot;bayt-efahlavī&quot;, and another hemistich titled &quot;zabān-e pahlavī&quot; (&quot;Fahlavi language&quot;).

==Loss of influence and death==
In 1312, his colleague Sa&#x27;d-al-Din Mohammad Avaji fell from power and was replaced by Taj-al-Din Ali-Shah Jilani. Then, in 1314, Öljaitü died and power passed to his son, Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan, who sided with Ali-Shah. In 1318, Rashid al-Din was charged with having poisoned Öljaitü and was executed on July 13, at the age of seventy. His Jewish ancestry was referenced numerous times in the court. His head was carried around the city after the execution and people were chanting: &quot;This is the head of the Jew who abused God&#x27;s name, may God&#x27;s curse be upon him.&quot;

His property was confiscated and &quot;Rab&#x27;-e Rashidi&quot;, with its scriptorium and its precious copies, were turned over to the Mongol soldiery. A century later, during the reign of Timur&#x27;s son Miran Shah, Rashid al-Din&#x27;s bones were exhumed from the Muslim cemetery and reburied in the Jewish cemetery.

==National and political thoughts==
Rashid al-din has been described as an ardent Sunni Muslim, an Iranian patriot and an admirer of the Iranian state traditions. His letters intensely criticize the sub-national Mongol amirs (whom he referred to as &quot;Turks&quot;), who made the centralized administration of the Ilkhan difficult. However, his historical writings do not express the same anti-Mongol and Iranian patriotic views so clearly or frequently. The authorship of the letters, which do express them clearly, is disputed and many historians consider them a forgery, as explained above.

<doc id="564586" wikidata="Q2945624" url="?curid=564586" title="John Brown (physician, born 1810)">
<text>John Brown (22 September 1810 – 11 May 1882) was a Scottish physician and essayist known for his three-volume &quot;Horae Subsecivae&quot; (Leisure Hours, 1858), containing essays and papers on art, medical history and biography. Best remembered are his dog story &quot;Rab and his Friends&quot; (1859) and his essays &quot;Pet Marjorie&quot; (1863), on Marjorie Fleming, the ten-year-old prodigy and alleged &quot;pet&quot; of Walter Scott, &quot;Our Dogs&quot;, &quot;Minchmoor&quot;, and &quot;The Enterkine&quot;. Brown was half-brother to the organic chemist Alexander Crum Brown.

==Life==

Brown was born in Biggar, Scotland, the son of Jane (née Nimmo) and clergyman John Brown (1784–1858). His mother died when he was six years old.

Brown, who was descended from eminent Presbyterian clergy, was educated at the Edinburgh High School. In 1833, he graduated with an MD from the University of Edinburgh, and practised as a physician in the city. After qualifying, he was apprenticed to James Syme. Brown subsequently acquired a large medical practice in Edinburgh at a time when infectious diseases took a heavy toll of life.

Brown&#x27;s house at 23 Rutland Street was the scene of many social gatherings. In 1840 he married Catherine Scott McKay and together they had three children; a daughter who died shortly after birth, another daughter, Helen, who was to marry Captain Alexander Laws, and a son &quot;Jock&quot; Brown. Helen Laws moved to Ireland and outlived her father. However, Jock was to survive into the 20th century and worked hard to pay tribute to his father, collecting all his letters, and working to erect a plaque on his house which remains to this day. In 1847, Brown became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and for a while was Honorary Librarian. He held strong views on the inappropriateness of examinations for evaluating student progress and was unimpressed by the view that scientific advances were in patients&#x27; best interests.

Brown was the friend of many contemporaries, including Thackeray and Mark Twain. His reputation is based on the two volumes of essays, &quot;Horae Subsecivae&quot; (&quot;Leisure Hours&quot;) (1858, 1861), &quot;John Leech and Other Papers&quot; (1882), &quot;Rab and His Friends&quot; (1859), and &quot;Marjorie Fleming: a Sketch&quot; (1863) (generally called &quot;Pet Marjorie&quot;). His first writing was in response to a request for contributions to the notices of paintings exhibited by the Royal Scottish Academy. The editor of the &quot;Scotsman&quot; newspaper then asked him to write regularly for the paper. He was 48 years old when he published &quot;Rab and His Friends&quot;. His writings were philosophical, classical, artistic, medical, of rural life, the Jacobite Rebellion, notable characters, humble folk and canine friends. These were published as a collection in 1858 as &quot;Horæ Subsecivæ&quot;, which ran to many editions. The first volume deals mainly with the equipment and duties of a physician, the second with subjects outside his profession.

Brown was revered and beloved to uncommon degree, and he was the cherished friend of many distinguished contemporaries, including Thackeray. Among those whose writing he encouraged was Henrietta Keddie, then a schoolgirl in Leith, who would become a prolific novelist and writer for children. In the mingling of tenderness and delicate humour, Brown has much in common with Lamb; in his insight into dog-nature he is unique. He wrote comparatively little; but all he wrote is good, some of it perfect of its kind.

Brown suffered during the latter years of his life from attacks of melancholy. He died at home at 23 Rutland Street in Edinburgh. on 11 May 1882, and was buried in his father&#x27;s plot in New Calton Cemetery. The grave lies on the western side on the edge of one of the terraces. The inscription to Brown and the base and are largely obscured, but it is confirmed by his mother&#x27;s name above.

==Family==
In 1840, Brown married Catherine Scott McKay (1819–1864).

==Publications==
*&quot;The Life of Dr Henry Marshall&quot;.
*&quot;Pet Marjorie&quot;
*&quot;The Little Book of Children&quot;

== Memorials ==
In 1923 a plaque was erected to Brown in the south-west corner of St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh. It was sculpted by Pilkington Jackson.

<text>Wait Chapel is a building on the campus of Wake Forest University. The first building constructed on the university&#x27;s Reynolda campus, in October 1956, it is named for Samuel Wait, the university&#x27;s first president. Its steeple reaches to . The chapel stands on the northeastern side of Hearn Plaza (Upper Quad), opposite Reynolda Hall.

The chapel, which seats 2,250 people, houses the Janet Jeffrey Carlile Harris Carillon of 48 bells and the Williams Organ, donated by Walter McAdoo Williams, namesake of Walter M. Williams High School.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at Wait Chapel on October 11, 1962. On March 17, 1978, president Jimmy Carter made a major National Security address in the chapel. In 1988, it hosted a presidential debate between George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis and, in 2000, between George W. Bush and Al Gore. On September 13, 2007, it hosted a broadcast of National Public Radio (NPR) show &quot;Wait, Wait, Don&#x27;t Tell Me&quot;. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke here in November 2011. A private memorial ceremony for Dr. Maya Angelou was held in Wait Chapel on June 7, 2014. Attendees included first lady Michelle Obama, president Bill Clinton, and Oprah Winfrey.

The chapel is linked to a vast underground series of tunnels crisscrossing the campus carrying utilities.

The congregation of Wake Forest Baptist Church once held regular Sunday services in the chapel; the church dissolved in 2022. In the late 1990s the chapel became the center of controversy when members of the church decided to conduct a same-sex commitment ceremony; this became the subject of the documentary &quot;A Union in Wait&quot;. Other events held in the chapel throughout the year include a Moravian lovefeast during the Christmas season.

<text>Serpins are a superfamily of proteins with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and are found in all kingdoms of life. The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors). They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt the target&#x27;s active site. This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.

Protease inhibition by serpins controls an array of biological processes, including coagulation and inflammation, and consequently these proteins are the target of medical research. Their unique conformational change also makes them of interest to the structural biology and protein folding research communities. The conformational-change mechanism confers certain advantages, but it also has drawbacks: serpins are vulnerable to mutations that can result in serpinopathies such as protein misfolding and the formation of inactive long-chain polymers. Serpin polymerisation not only reduces the amount of active inhibitor, but also leads to accumulation of the polymers, causing cell death and organ failure.

Although most serpins control proteolytic cascades, some proteins with a serpin structure are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead perform diverse functions such as storage (as in egg white—ovalbumin), transport as in hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin) and molecular chaperoning (HSP47). The term &quot;serpin&quot; is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, since they are evolutionarily related.

== History ==
Protease inhibitory activity in blood plasma was first reported in the late 1800s, but it was not until the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated, with the subsequent recognition of their close family homology in 1979. That they belonged to a new protein family became apparent on their further alignment with the non-inhibitory egg-white protein ovalbumin, to give what was initially called the &quot;alpha1-antitrypsin-antithrombin III-ovalbumin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors,&quot; but was subsequently succinctly renamed as the Serpins. The initial characterisation of the new family centred on alpha1-antitrypsin, a serpin present in high concentration in blood plasma, the common genetic disorder of which was shown to cause a predisposition to the lung disease emphysema and to liver cirrhosis. The identification of the S and Z mutations responsible for the genetic deficiency and the subsequent sequence alignments of alpha1-antitrypsin and antithrombin in 1982 led to the recognition of the close homologies of the active sites of the two proteins, centred on a methionine in alpha1-antitrypsin as an inhibitor of tissue elastase and on arginine in antithrombin as an inhibitor of thrombin.

The critical role of the active centre residue in determining the specificity of inhibition of serpins was unequivocally confirmed by the finding that a natural mutation of the active centre methionine  in alpha1-antitrypsin to an arginine, as in antithrombin, resulted in a severe bleeding disorder. This active-centre specificity of inhibition was also evident in the many other families of protease inhibitors but the serpins differed from them in being much larger proteins and also in possessing what was soon apparent as an inherent ability to undergo a change in shape. The nature of this conformational change was revealed with the determination in 1984 of the first crystal structure of a serpin, that of post-cleavage alpha1-antitrypsin. This together with the subsequent solving of the structure of native (uncleaved) ovalbumin indicated that the inhibitory mechanism of the  serpins involved a remarkable conformational shift,  with the movement of the exposed peptide loop containing the reactive site and its incorporation as a middle strand in the main beta-pleated sheet that characterises the serpin molecule. Early evidence of the essential role of this loop movement in the inhibitory mechanism came from the finding that even minor aberrations in the amino acid residues that form the hinge of the movement in antithrombin resulted in thrombotic disease. Ultimate confirmation of the linked displacement of the target protease by this loop movement was provided  in 2000 by the structure of the post-inhibitory complex of alpha1-antitrypsin with trypsin, showing how the displacement results in the deformation and inactivation of the attached protease. Subsequent structural studies have revealed an additional advantage of the conformational mechanism in allowing the subtle modulation of inhibitory activity, as notably seen at tissue level with the functionally diverse serpins in human plasma.

Over 1000 serpins have now been identified, including 36 human proteins, as well as molecules in all kingdoms of life—animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and archaea—and some viruses. The central feature of all is a tightly conserved framework, which allows the precise alignment of their key structural and functional components based on the template structure of alpha1-antitrypsin. In the 2000s, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in order to categorise members of the serpin superfamily based on their evolutionary relationships. Serpins are therefore the largest and most diverse superfamily of protease inhibitors.

== Activity ==

Most serpins are protease inhibitors, targeting extracellular, chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. These proteases possess a nucleophilic serine residue in a catalytic triad in their active site. Examples include thrombin, trypsin, and human neutrophil elastase. Serpins act as irreversible, suicide inhibitors by trapping an intermediate of the protease&#x27;s catalytic mechanism.

Some serpins inhibit other protease classes, typically cysteine proteases, and are termed &quot;cross-class inhibitors&quot;. These enzymes differ from serine proteases in that they use a nucleophilic cysteine residue, rather than a serine, in their active site. Nonetheless, the enzymatic chemistry is similar, and the mechanism of inhibition by serpins is the same for both classes of protease. Examples of cross-class inhibitory serpins include serpin B4 a squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (SCCA-1) and the avian serpin myeloid and erythroid nuclear termination stage-specific protein (MENT), which both inhibit papain-like cysteine proteases.

==Biological function and localization==

=== Protease inhibition ===
Approximately two-thirds of human serpins perform extracellular roles, inhibiting proteases in the bloodstream in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples of the range of functions performed by human serpin, as well as some of the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.

The protease targets of intracellular inhibitory serpins have been difficult to identify, since many of these molecules appear to perform overlapping roles. Further, many human serpins lack precise functional equivalents in model organisms such as the mouse. Nevertheless, an important function of intracellular serpins may be to protect against the inappropriate activity of proteases inside the cell. For example, one of the best-characterised human intracellular serpins is Serpin B9, which inhibits the cytotoxic granule protease granzyme B. In doing so, Serpin B9 may protect against inadvertent release of granzyme B and premature or unwanted activation of cell death pathways.

Some viruses use serpins to disrupt protease functions in their host. The cowpox viral serpin CrmA (cytokine response modifier A) is used in order to avoid inflammatory and apoptotic responses of infected host cells. CrmA increases infectivity by suppressing its host&#x27;s inflammatory response through inhibition of IL-1 and IL-18 processing by the cysteine protease caspase-1. In eukaryotes, a plant serpin inhibits both metacaspases and a papain-like cysteine protease.

=== Non-inhibitory roles ===
Non-inhibitory extracellular serpins also perform a wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen&#x27;s triple helix whilst it is being processed in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Some serpins are both protease inhibitors and perform additional roles. For example, the nuclear cysteine protease inhibitor MENT, in birds also acts as a chromatin remodelling molecule in a bird&#x27;s red blood cells.

== Structure ==
All serpins share a common structure (or fold), despite their varied functions. All typically have three β-sheets (named A, B and C) and eight or nine α-helices (named hA–hI). The most significant regions to serpin function are the A-sheet and the reactive centre loop (RCL). The A-sheet includes two β-strands that are in a parallel orientation with a region between them called the &#x27;shutter&#x27;, and upper region called the &#x27;breach&#x27;. The RCL forms the initial interaction with the target protease in inhibitory molecules. Structures have been solved showing the RCL either fully exposed or partially inserted into the A-sheet, and serpins are thought to be in dynamic equilibrium between these two states. The RCL also only makes temporary interactions with the rest of the structure, and is therefore highly flexible and exposed to the solvent.

The serpin structures that have been determined cover several different conformations, which has been necessary for the understanding of their multiple-step mechanism of action. Structural biology has therefore played a central role in the understanding of serpin function and biology.

==Conformational change and inhibitory mechanism==
Inhibitory serpins do not inhibit their target proteases by the typical competitive (&quot;lock-and-key&quot;) mechanism used by most small protease inhibitors (e.g. Kunitz-type inhibitors). Instead, serpins use an unusual conformational change, which disrupts the structure of the protease and prevents it from completing catalysis. The conformational change involves the RCL moving to the opposite end of the protein and inserting into β-sheet A, forming an extra antiparallel β-strand. This converts the serpin from a stressed state, to a lower-energy relaxed state (S to R transition).

Serine and cysteine proteases catalyse peptide bond cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue of the active site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is hydrolysed and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolysed. The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.

Since the RCL is still covalently attached to the protease via the ester bond, the S to R transition pulls protease from the top to the bottom of the serpin and distorts the catalytic triad. The distorted protease can only hydrolyse the acyl enzyme intermediate extremely slowly and so the protease remains covalently attached for days to weeks. Serpins are classed as irreversible inhibitors and as suicide inhibitors since each serpin protein permanently inactivates a single protease, and can only function once.

===Allosteric activation===

The conformational mobility of serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, the function of inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted into the top of the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.

The archetypal example of this situation is antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward the body of the serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.

=== Latent conformation ===
Certain serpins spontaneously undergo the S to R transition without having been cleaved by a protease, to form a conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is not exactly the same as the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.

Regulation of the latency transition can act as a control mechanism in some serpins, such as PAI-1. Although PAI-1 is produced in the inhibitory S conformation, it &quot;auto-inactivates&quot; by changing to the latent state unless it is bound to the cofactor vitronectin. Similarly, antithrombin can also spontaneously convert to the latent state, as an additional modulation mechanism to its allosteric activation by heparin. Finally, the N-terminus of , a serpin from &quot;Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis&quot;, is required to lock the molecule in the native inhibitory state. Disruption of interactions made by the N-terminal region results in spontaneous conformational change of this serpin to the latent conformation.

=== Conformational change in non-inhibitory functions ===
Certain non-inhibitory serpins also use the serpin conformational change as part of their function. For example, the native (S) form of thyroxine-binding globulin has high affinity for thyroxine, whereas the cleaved (R) form has low affinity. Similarly, transcortin has higher affinity for cortisol when in its native (S) state, than its cleaved (R) state. Thus, in these serpins, RCL cleavage and the S to R transition has been commandeered to allow for ligand release, rather than protease inhibition.

In some serpins, the S to R transition can activate cell signalling events. In these cases, a serpin that has formed a complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells to the presence of protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.

==Degradation==
When a serpin inhibits a target protease, it forms a permanent complex, which needs to be disposed of. For extracellular serpins, the final serpin-enzyme complexes are rapidly cleared from circulation. One mechanism by which this occurs in mammals is via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), which binds to inhibitory complexes made by antithrombin, PA1-1, and neuroserpin, causing cellular uptake. Similarly, the &quot;Drosophila&quot; necrotic serpin is degraded in the lysosome after being trafficked into the cell by the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (homologous to the mammalian LDL receptor family).

==Disease and serpinopathies==
Serpins are involved in a wide array of physiological functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common hereditary diseases.

=== Inactivity or absence ===

Since the stressed serpin fold is high-energy, mutations can cause them to incorrectly change into their lower-energy conformations (e.g. relaxed or latent) before they have correctly performed their inhibitory role.

Mutations that affect the rate or the extent of RCL insertion into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by reducing the amount of active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants &quot;wibble&quot; and &quot;wobble&quot;, both promote formation of the latent state.

The structure of the disease-linked mutant of antichymotrypsin (L55P) revealed another, inactive &quot;δ-conformation&quot;. In the δ-conformation, four residues of the RCL are inserted into the top of β-sheet A. The bottom half of the sheet is filled as a result of one of the α-helices (the F-helix) partially switching to a β-strand conformation, completing the β-sheet hydrogen bonding. It is unclear whether other serpins can adopt this conformer, and whether this conformation has a functional role, but it is speculated that the δ-conformation may be adopted by Thyroxine-binding globulin during thyroxine release. The non-inhibitory proteins related to serpins can also cause diseases when mutated. For example, mutations in SERPINF1 cause osteogenesis imperfecta type VI in humans.

In the absence of a required serpin, the protease that it normally would regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies. Consequently, simple deficiency of a serpin (e.g. a null mutation) can result in disease. Gene knockouts, particularly in mice, are used experimentally to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of their absence.

=== Specificity change ===
In some rare cases, a single amino acid change in a serpin&#x27;s RCL alters its specificity to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) causes the α1-antitrypsin serpin to inhibit thrombin, causing a bleeding disorder.

=== Polymerisation and aggregation ===
The majority of serpin diseases are due to protein aggregation and are termed &quot;serpinopathies&quot;. Serpins are vulnerable to disease-causing mutations that promote formation of misfolded polymers due to their inherently unstable structures. Well-characterised serpinopathies include α1-antitrypsin deficiency (alpha-1), which may cause familial emphysema, and sometimes liver cirrhosis, certain familial forms of thrombosis related to antithrombin deficiency, types 1 and 2 hereditary angioedema (HAE) related to deficiency of C1-inhibitor, and familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB; a rare type of dementia caused by neuroserpin polymerisation).

Each monomer of the serpin aggregate exists in the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the endoplasmic reticulum of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the details of how serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.

Physiological serpin polymers are thought to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with the final stages of serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both dimer and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the dimer (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule&#x27;s RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped dimer and trimer structures are thought to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.

====Therapeutic strategies====
Several therapeutic approaches are in use or under investigation to treat the most common serpinopathy: antitrypsin deficiency. Antitrypsin augmentation therapy is approved for severe antitrypsin deficiency-related emphysema. In this therapy, antitrypsin is purified from the plasma of blood donors and administered intravenously (first marketed as Prolastin). To treat severe antitrypsin deficiency-related disease, lung and liver transplantation has proven effective. In animal models, gene targeting in induced pluripotent stem cells has been successfully used to correct an antitrypsin polymerisation defect and to restore the ability of the mammalian liver to secrete active antitrypsin. Small molecules have also been developed that block antitrypsin polymerisation &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==Evolution==
Serpins are the most widely distributed and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.

Protease-inhibition is thought to be the ancestral function, with non-inhibitory members the results of evolutionary neofunctionalisation of the structure. The S to R conformational change has also been adapted by some binding serpins to regulate affinity for their targets.

==Distribution==

===Animal===

====Human====
The human genome encodes 16 serpin clades, termed through , including 29 inhibitory and 7 non-inhibitory serpin proteins. The human serpin naming system is based upon a phylogenetic analysis of approximately 500 serpins from 2001, with proteins named , where X is the clade of the protein and Y the number of the protein within that clade. The functions of human serpins have been determined by a combination of biochemical studies, human genetic disorders, and knockout mouse models.


====Specialised mammalian serpins====
Many mammalian serpins have been identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) as well as the uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in transplacental transport.

===Insect===
The &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; genome contains 29 serpin encoding genes. Amino acid sequence analysis has placed 14 of these serpins in serpin clade Q and three in serpin clade K with the remaining twelve classified as orphan serpins not belonging to any clade. The clade classification system is difficult to use for &quot;Drosophila&quot; serpins and instead a nomenclature system has been adopted that is based on the position of serpin genes on the &quot;Drosophila&quot; chromosomes. Thirteen of the &quot;Drosophila&quot; serpins occur as isolated genes in the genome (including Serpin-27A, see below), with the remaining 16 organised into five gene clusters that occur at chromosome positions 28D (2 serpins), 42D (5 serpins), 43A (4 serpins), 77B (3 serpins) and 88E (2 serpins).

Studies on &quot;Drosophila&quot; serpins reveal that Serpin-27A inhibits the Easter protease (the final protease in the Nudel, Gastrulation Defective, Snake and Easter proteolytic cascade) and thus controls dorsoventral patterning. Easter functions to cleave Spätzle (a chemokine-type ligand), which results in toll-mediated signaling. As well as its central role in embryonic patterning, toll signaling is also important for the innate immune response in insects. Accordingly, serpin-27A also functions to control the insect immune response. In &quot;Tenebrio molitor&quot; (a large beetle), a protein (SPN93) comprising two discrete tandem serpin domains functions to regulate the toll proteolytic cascade.

===Nematode===
The genome of the nematode worm &quot;C. elegans&quot; contains 9 serpins, all of which lack signal sequences and so are likely intracellular. However, only 5 of these serpins appear to function as protease inhibitors. One, SRP-6, performs a protective function and guards against stress-induced calpain-associated lysosomal disruption. Further, SRP-6 inhibits lysosomal cysteine proteases released after lysosomal rupture. Accordingly, worms lacking SRP-6 are sensitive to stress. Most notably, SRP-6 knockout worms die when placed in water (the hypo-osmotic stress lethal phenotype or Osl). It has therefore been suggested that lysosomes play a general and controllable role in determining cell fate.

===Plant===
Plant serpins were amongst the first members of the superfamily that were identified. The serpin barley protein Z is highly abundant in barley grain, and one of the major protein components in beer. The genome of the model plant, &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; contain 18 serpin-like genes, although only 8 of these are full-length serpin sequences.

Plant serpins are potent inhibitors of mammalian chymotrypsin-like serine proteases &quot;in vitro&quot;, the best-studied example being barley serpin Zx (BSZx), which is able to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin as well as several blood coagulation factors. However, close relatives of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases are absent in plants. The RCL of several serpins from wheat grain and rye contain poly-Q repeat sequences similar to those present in the prolamin storage proteins of the endosperm. It has therefore been suggested that plant serpins may function to inhibit proteases from insects or microbes that would otherwise digest grain storage proteins. In support of this hypothesis, specific plant serpins have been identified in the phloem sap of pumpkin (CmPS-1) and cucumber plants. Although an inverse correlation between up-regulation of CmPS-1 expression and aphid survival was observed, &quot;in vitro&quot; feeding experiments revealed that recombinant CmPS-1 did not appear to affect insect survival.

Alternative roles and protease targets for plant serpins have been proposed. The &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; serpin, AtSerpin1 (At1g47710; ), mediates set-point control over programmed cell death by targeting the &#x27;Responsive to Desiccation-21&#x27; (RD21) papain-like cysteine protease. AtSerpin1 also inhibits metacaspase-like proteases &quot;in vitro&quot;. Two other &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; serpins, AtSRP2 (At2g14540) and AtSRP3 (At1g64030) appear to be involved in responses to DNA damage.

===Fungal===
A single fungal serpin has been characterized to date: from &quot;Piromyces&quot; spp. strain E2. &quot;Piromyces&quot; is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains in addition to its serpin domain. Dockerins are commonly found in proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.

===Prokaryotic===
Predicted serpin genes are sporadically distributed in prokaryotes. &quot;In vitro&quot; studies on some of these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors &quot;in vivo&quot;. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although &quot;Clostridium thermocellum&quot; serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.

===Viral===
Serpins are also expressed by viruses as a way to evade the host&#x27;s immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of interest because of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase 1 and caspase 8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.

<text>Robert Lawrence Trask (10 November 1944 – 27 March 2004) was an American-British professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex, and an authority on the Basque language and the field of historical linguistics.

==Biography== 
Born in Olean, New York, he initially studied chemistry in his home country, but – after a brief stint in the Peace Corps – he took an interest in linguistics. He received his doctorate in linguistics from the University of London, and thereafter taught at various universities in the United Kingdom. He became a professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex.

He was considered an authority on the Basque language: his book &quot;The History of Basque&quot; (1997) is an essential reference on diachronic Basque linguistics and probably the best introduction to Basque linguistics as a whole. He was at work compiling an etymological dictionary of that language when he died; the unfinished work was posthumously published on the Internet by Max W. Wheeler. He was also an authority on historical linguistics, and had written about the problem of the origin of language.
He also published two introductory books to linguistics: &quot;Language: The basics&quot; (1995) and &quot;Introducing Linguistics&quot; (coauthored with Bill Mayblin) (2000), and several dictionaries on different topics of this science: &quot;A dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics&quot; (1993), &quot;A dictionary of phonetics and phonology&quot; (1996), &quot;A student&#x27;s dictionary of language and linguistics&quot; (1997), &quot;Key concepts in language and linguistics&quot; (1999), &quot;The dictionary of historical and comparative linguistics&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Penguin dictionary of English grammar&quot; (2000).

Trask died on 27 March 2004 as a result of complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), aged 59.

<doc id="564598" wikidata="Q7712954" url="?curid=564598" title="The Al Franken Show">
<text>The Al Franken Show was the flagship talk show of the former talk radio network, Air America Radio. Hosted by Al Franken, it featured commentary and interviews arguing for liberal positions on the issues of the day, and comically poking fun at the George W. Bush Administration. Franken had been a comedian, satirist, and the author of several books, including the 2003 &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;. He was a writer and performer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he usually teamed with fellow writer/performer Tom Davis.

The show began as The O&#x27;Franken Factor on March 31, 2004. Between January 3, 2006, and February 14, 2007, the show was recorded and broadcast from the 28th floor of the historic Foshay Tower in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. Prior to that date it was based in New York City. The final show was broadcast on February 14, 2007, the day Franken announced his candidacy for the United States Senate election of 2008. Franken&#x27;s bid for the Senate was successful, with him serving there until resigning in 2018.

== History ==

From the show&#x27;s inception in March 2004 until October 7, 2005, the show was co-hosted by experienced journalist Katherine Lanpher. Lanpher left the show to write &quot;Leap Days&quot;, a memoir about her experiences moving to New York City. Lanpher did not rejoin the show because she did not wish to move again when Franken relocated to Minnesota. In November 2005, Franken told an audience in Berkeley, California that he would not seek a replacement for Lanpher. Her departure did not substantially change the content of the show.

When the show began, Franken signed a one-year contract. &quot;I&#x27;m doing this because I want to use my energies to get Bush unelected. I&#x27;d be happy if the election of a Democrat ended the show&quot;, he said in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Bush won a second term on November 2, 2004, but Franken said that the show would continue whether a Democrat or a Republican was in office.

Beginning on September 7, 2004, Sundance Channel broadcast a one-hour televised version of the show on weekdays. The show aired its last episode in November 2004. The channel inked a new contract with Franken and aired a second season of the show from June 6, 2005, until early November 2005.

On November 15, 2006, Air America affiliate KQKE-AM in San Francisco announced that Franken would leave Air America on December 10, as indicated by an audio clip posted on Whatamockery.com. After December 10, though Franken was still on Air America, KQKE began airing the &quot;Thom Hartmann Program&quot; in place of the &quot;Al Franken Show&quot;.

On his January 29, 2007, show, Franken announced that his last show on Air America Radio would be that Valentine&#x27;s Day. Affiliates who carried the Franken show carried Thom Hartmann after that date, while XM Satellite Radio now carries Ed Schultz in that time slot. At the end of his final show, Franken announced his intention to run for the United States Senate from Minnesota.

==The O&#x27;Franken Factor==
Until July 12, 2004, the name of the show was &quot;The O&#x27;Franken Factor&quot;. That name was a jibe at Bill O&#x27;Reilly and his &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;. O&#x27;Reilly is widely thought to have instigated Fox News Channel&#x27;s lawsuit against Franken for using their trademarked phrase &quot;fair and balanced&quot;, which was thrown out of court in summary judgment, but ended up giving publicity to Franken and his book &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them&quot;. Franken said that he chose the title to &quot;annoy and bait&quot; O&#x27;Reilly into suing him again, thus generating additional publicity. That lawsuit never came, and on July 12, 2004, the program was renamed &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot;.

Franken described his show as taking place in a &quot;Zero Spin Zone&quot; where Franken pledged to tell the truth and there was &quot;no spinning allowed&quot;. This was a parody of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s characterization of the &quot;O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; as a &quot;No-Spin Zone&quot;.

==Regular guests==
The show&#x27;s regular guests included respected progressive issues and current events analysts: Jonathan Alter, David Brock, Joe Conason, John Dickerson, James Fallows, Howard Fineman, Christy Harvey, Paul Krugman, Thomas Oliphant, Norman Ornstein, George Packer, Melanie Sloan, David Sirota, Bernie Sanders, and Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell Jr.

==Regular features==
In addition to general political discussion, the show featured several recurring comic relief segments. These included:

; Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Lie To Me! : Every Friday afternoon, Franken hosted a mini-game show with fellow judge Joe Conason. The contestant listened to a series of audio clips from earlier in the week, and was asked to identify whether each statement made is the truth, a lie, or a &quot;weasel&quot; (defined as &quot;a statement that is technically true, but intended to mislead&quot;). The title was based on the National Public Radio show &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; Contestants received a copy of &quot;The Al Franken Show Party Album&quot; regardless of their performance, though Franken referred to the CD as both the prize for winning and consolation prize for losing. In the spirit of the lying theme, Franken frequently stated that the game won ever increasing numbers of Peabody Awards—over one hundred by the end of the show—which itself was a humorous dig at Bill O&#x27;Reilly, who incorrectly boasted that his former show, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, won two Peabodies. The segment&#x27;s theme music was the 1987 Fleetwood Mac hit song &quot;Little Lies&quot;.
; Hate Email of the Day : Franken picked his favorite hate email and read it on the air, often noting spelling and grammatical errors, and usually concluding with &quot;We take your criticisms very seriously.&quot;
; Boring Correction : Taking great pride in the veracity of the information cited by his program, Franken invited his audience to bring any factual errors to his attention so they could be addressed. Franken would then issue a live on-air &quot;Boring Correction&quot; where, to a jaunty tune and the sound of typewriter in the background, he corrected the error. Most of the time, the &quot;boring correction&quot; addressed a hypertechnicality rather than a substantive error.
; &quot;Resident Dittohead&quot; Mark Luther : The show regularly featured a segment with Mark Luther, Franken&#x27;s childhood friend and self-proclaimed dittohead. Franken would play a clip by Rush Limbaugh, take issue with Limbaugh&#x27;s facts or logic, and argue about it with Luther.
; Good Ribbin&#x27; : A correspondent would travel to some of the best southern barbecue hot spots in the country, to talk with people who love barbecue and hate Franken&#x27;s show. Patrons were invited to tell the audience what they were eating and then argue with Franken.
; The Fifteen Second Debunk : An audio clip was played, and then debunked by another audio clip from the same person. Although the two clips were usually less than fifteen seconds, they were preceded by very lengthy introduction and followed by a lengthy outro.
; Nigel Chestley : Franken played a BBC correspondent who sometimes reported on international news, and other times simply provided an update on the Queen&#x27;s long running drum solo.
; Senior Moment : Franken played Enid Davenport, a crotchety old woman who offered an extremely confused perspective on the news (she preferred to call the segment &quot;A piece of my mind&quot;). This character was somewhat reminiscent of Gilda Radner&#x27;s Emily Litella from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.
; The Slide Whistle : Franken played a slide whistle along with the highs and lows of President Bush&#x27;s approval rating since taking office. The whistle started with a moderate note, raised to a high note to reflect the time period following 9/11, then steadily sunk to lower notes as Bush&#x27;s popularity decreased (with occasional blips of higher notes in between). This was a popular segment surrounding State of the Union addresses.
; Right-Wing Non-Lie of the Day : Franken would play a clip of a conservative telling a &quot;non-lie,&quot; which would usually last for about ten seconds. On &quot;The Very Best of the O&#x27;Franken Factor&quot;, featured non-lies included Rush Limbaugh saying he was looking at an op-ed piece in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and Bill O&#x27;Reilly reading the definition of the word &quot;conundrum.&quot;

Some other skits no longer occurred regularly after Katherine Lanpher left the show. These included:
* The Oy Yoy Yoy Show, in which Franken played &quot;old Al&quot; and responded to a litany of depressing news items by saying &quot;Oy&quot;, along with a constant expression of concern for Israel
* Mastication Theater, in which Franken and Lanpher would perform a skit while stuffing their mouths with food

==Swing State Tour==
In the run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, the show went on a &quot;Swing State Tour&quot; that included stops in
* San Diego, California (though California was not often considered a swing state)
* San Francisco, California
* Denver, Colorado
* Minneapolis, Minnesota
* Madison, Wisconsin
* Columbus, Ohio
* Miami, Florida

==Music==

* Theme: Grateful Dead - &quot;Terrapin Station&quot; (live)
* Grateful Dead - &quot;Sugaree&quot; (live)
* Grateful Dead - &quot;China Cat Sunflower&quot; (live)
* Commercial Bumpers: Grateful Dead &quot;Going Down the Road Feeling Bad&quot; (live)

Launched between 1967 and 1988 to monitor NATO and merchant vessels using radar, the satellites were powered by nuclear reactors.

Because a return signal from an ordinary target illuminated by a radar transmitter diminishes as the inverse of the fourth power of the distance, for the surveillance radar to work effectively, US-A satellites had to be placed in low Earth orbit. Had they used large solar panels for power, the orbit would have rapidly decayed due to drag through the upper atmosphere. Further, the satellite would have been useless in the shadow of Earth. Hence the majority of the satellites carried type BES-5 nuclear reactors fuelled by uranium-235. Normally the nuclear reactor cores were ejected into high orbit (a so-called &quot;disposal orbit&quot;) at the end of the mission, but there were several failure incidents, some of which resulted in radioactive material re-entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

The US-A programme was responsible for orbiting a total of 33 nuclear reactors, 31 of them BES-5 types with a capacity of providing about two kilowatts of power for the radar unit. In addition, in 1987 the Soviets launched two larger TOPAZ nuclear reactors (six kilowatts) in Kosmos satellites (Kosmos 1818 and Kosmos 1867) which were each capable of operating for six months. The higher-orbiting TOPAZ-containing satellites were the major source of orbital contamination for satellites that sensed gamma-rays for astronomical and security purposes, as radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) do not generate significant gamma radiation as compared with unshielded satellite fission reactors, and all of the BES-5-containing spacecraft orbited too low to cause positron pollution in the magnetosphere.

The last US-A satellite was launched 14 March 1988.

==Incidents==
* Launch failure, 25 April 1973. Launch failed and the reactor fell into the Pacific Ocean north of Japan. Radiation was detected by US air sampling airplanes.
* Kosmos 367 (04564 / 1970-079A), 3 October 1970, failed 110 hours after launch, moved to higher orbit.
* Kosmos 954. The satellite failed to boost into a nuclear-safe storage orbit as planned. Nuclear materials re-entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 24 January 1978 and left a trail of radioactive pollution over an estimated 124,000 square kilometres of Canada&#x27;s Northwest Territories.
* Kosmos 1402. Failed to boost into storage orbit in late 1982. The reactor core was separated from the remainder of the spacecraft and was the last piece of the satellite to return to Earth, landing in the South Atlantic Ocean on 7 February 1983.
* Kosmos 1900. The primary system failed to eject the reactor core into storage orbit, but the backup managed to push it into an orbit below its intended altitude.

== Other concerns ==
Although most nuclear cores were successfully ejected into higher orbits, their orbits will still eventually decay.

US-A satellites were a major source of space debris in low Earth orbit. The debris is created two ways:

*During 16 reactor core ejections, approximately 128 kg of NaK-78 (a fusible alloy eutectic of 22% and 78% w/w sodium and potassium, respectively) escaped from the primary coolant systems of the BES-5 reactors. The smaller droplets have already decayed/reentered, but larger droplets (up to 5.5 cm in diameter) are still in orbit. Since the metal coolant was exposed to neutron radiation, it contains some radioactive argon-39, with a half-life of 269 years. There is no risk of surface contamination, as the droplets will burn up completely in the upper atmosphere on re-entry and the argon, a chemically inert gas, will dissipate. The major risk is impact with operational satellites.
*An additional mechanism is through the impact of space debris hitting intact contained coolant loops. A number of these old satellites are punctured by orbiting space debris—calculated to be 8 percent over any 50-year period—and release their remaining NaK coolant into space. The coolant self-forms into frozen droplets of solid sodium-potassium of up to around several centimeters in size, and these solid objects then become a significant source of space debris themselves.

<text>Janjevci (, , ), Kosovo Croats (, ) or Janjevci Croats () are a Croat community in Kosovo, inhabiting the town of Janjevo and surrounding villages near Pristina, as well as villages centered on Letnica near Vitia (Šašare, Vrnez, and Vrnavokolo), who are also known as &quot;Letničani&quot;. They are not officially recognised as a national minority group.

They are considered among the oldest of the Croatian diaspora communities.

==Identity and culture==
The Janjevci, an ethnic Croat community, derive their name from their traditional community center, Janjevo. It is believed that the community descends from migrating merchants, miners and entrepreneurs from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik and its hinterland, families Glasnović, Macukić, Ćibarić, Matić, Ivanović), Bosnia and Herzegovina (families Ivanović and Brkić) and Kotor who settled the area in the 14th century medieval Serbia, The earliest written record of Catholics in Janjevo is a letter from Pope Benedict XI, dated 1303, which mentions the Catholic parish of St. Nicholas with its center in Janjevo. Together with the Saxons from Saxony, they worked in the Serbian mines. The Croatian population of Shasharë is believed to be of partial Saxon origin. Stronger national awareness among Janjevci came in the 19th century thanks to the work of the Herzegovinian Franciscan Franjo Brkić and the teacher Jakov Slišković, as well as during the interwar period.

===Folklore===
The Albanian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Turkish influences are visible in folk costumes, songs and oral tradition.

====Oral traditions====
Janjevci have several legends related to the origin of Janjevo. The first one describes how in the &quot;dilbokoj planini&quot; (&quot;deep mountain&quot;), after a general famine, a sister and a brother lived alone, who did not know that they were related to the new Janjevo, while the second story mentions the terrible fate of people after the war and how they are the only ones Jana Palić &quot;Nedokoljka&quot; and one of the Glasnovićs are still alive; both stories are based on massive deaths and suffering during the Mongol invasion of the area.

====Folk costume====
The costume of adult men consisted of a mixture of oriental and Bulgarian costumes: a &quot;šubara&quot; on the head, then a shirt, a &quot;čakšire&quot; (long trousers with a long tour and narrow legs that fasten on the sides), &quot;mintan&quot; or &quot;palta&quot; (coat). A belt was tied around the middle of the body, and &quot;kondure&quot; or &quot;jemenije&quot; (shoes) were put on the feet.

Women, on the contrary, kept the oriental costume influenced by the Ottomans. Married women wore a &quot;fes&quot; or &quot;otos&quot; (a cloth cap sewn from velvet) on their head, and unmarried women wore a &quot;kucelj&quot; (braid) down their backs. A &quot;šamija&quot; (scarf) was also put on the head, woolen outside the house, and ordinary inside the house. On the upper part of the body, a &quot;mintan&quot; or &quot;mintanče&quot; (jacket) was worn, that is, a &quot;jelek&quot; or &quot;žamadan&quot; (vest), under which was a shirt with a lace collar. Women did not wear skirts, but &quot;dimije&quot;, over which a richly decorated &quot;bošča&quot; (apron) was draped, and the waist was tied with a &quot;kušak&quot; (belt). On working days, they wore &quot;nalunas&quot; (loafers), and when they went out of the house they put on &quot;jemenije&quot; (shoes) similar to civilian ones. Formal women&#x27;s clothing was very expensive and colorful, so it was accompanied by appropriate jewelry: &quot;dukati&quot;, gold necklaces, &quot;đinđuves&quot; (pearl necklaces), &quot;curaće&quot; (earrings) and rings. Women&#x27;s wedding clothing included, in addition to &quot;mintančet&quot;, &quot;dimije&quot;, shirts and a fez, a terlik (saffian shoes with ornaments), a &quot;duak&quot; (veil), earrings, a ring, two rows of &quot;rubije&quot; (Ducats) as head jewelry and one larger Ducat that went on forehead.

===Language===
According to Croatian classification, they speak in Janjevo-Lepenica idiom, which belongs to Torlak dialect group.

The names for the parts of the day are borrowed from Turkish: &quot;saba&quot; (morning), &quot;ićindije&quot; (afternoon after sunset) and &quot;akšam&quot; (dusk after sunset). Turkicisms are also &quot;belendzika&quot; (a thin oriental bracelet in a series of five to six), &quot;džam&quot; (glass), &quot;ćumbe&quot; (stove), &quot;tendžera&quot; (pot), &quot;duvar&quot; (wall). From Bulgarian &quot;chromid&quot; they took &quot;chromit&quot; (onion). Some family names are also Turkicisms: &quot;adža&quot; (uncle, father&#x27;s brother), &quot;balduza&quot; (wife&#x27;s sister), &quot;teza&quot; (maternal aunt), &quot;badžanak&quot; (each of the husbands of two sisters in relation to each other) and Albanisms: &quot;tota&quot; (grandmother) and &quot;nana&quot; (mother).

===Religion===
They have maintained their Catholic faith until today. Accordingng to the work of Croatian historian Đuro Arnold, the Janjevci have adopted the tradition of celebrating &quot;Slava&quot; - patron saint of the family (Arnold, 2013). Most of the families together celebrate Saint Nicholas (December 6 and May 9), Christmas and &quot;Veligdan&quot; (lit. &quot;Great Day&quot;, Easter) along with Saint Sebastian, Saint Anne and Anthony of Padua. According to the research of anthropologist Pero Lučin, on the evening before the main feast, traditional &quot;Pogača&quot; bread and a candle are blessed by a priest and used at the family gathering (Lučin, 2004). 

Family pilgrimages are made in Letnica at the &quot;Gulem Gospođindan&quot; (lit. &quot;Great Lady-day&quot;, Assumption of Mary), &quot;Mali Gospođindan&quot; (lit. &quot;Small Lady-day&quot;, Birth of Mary), Our Lady of Mount Carmel, St. Anne and in Pristina on the St. Anthony of Padua feastday. Janjevci would go on a pilgrimage to Letnica for the feast of the Assumption since the feast of St. Ane, on July 26, and they would stay there until August 19, then the whole family life would move to Letnica, where they would stay in &quot;zagrađi&quot; (&quot;enclosures&quot;, special buildings in a row with a common wall that closed in a circle). However, the central place in the piety of the Janjevci was occupied by the veneration of St. Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors and travelers, and such a connection of the people of Janjevo on land with this saint connected to the sea is considered as a connection with the Franciscan ancestors who arrived in Kosovo from the Adriatic coast. Since the Middle Ages, they have attended Feast of St. Blaise in Dubrovnik and are regular members of the procession in which they are dressed in their folk costumes.

The community also celebrates Saint George&#x27;s Day (known among Janjevci as &quot;Đurđevdan&quot;) - an important holiday, especially for teen Janjevci who would prepare a special celebration called &quot;rifana&quot;, which lasted all night, where mischievous &quot;bećari&quot; (guys) tried to steal the prepared food from the girls they loved and cut the rope on the swings on which they were swinging. The parish church celebrates its feast day on the day of Translation of the Relics of Saint Nicholas from Myra to Bari (May 9 in byzantine calendar) which is known among Janjevci as &quot;sveti Nikola ljetni&quot; (lit. &quot;Summer St. Nicholas&quot;, also &quot;župna slava&quot; (&quot;parish Slava&quot;) or &quot;dan župe&quot; (&quot;parish day&quot;)). On the feast of St. John the Baptist, they would burn straw that children jumped over, the custom was called &quot;kalavešnica&quot; and is connected to the pre-Christian celebration of the summer solstice.

==Demographic history==
In 1948, there were 5,290 Croats (0.7%) in Kosovo; in 1971 - 8,264; in 1981 - 8,718 (0.6%); in 1991 - 8,161 (0.4%). Considering Janjevo, in 1981 there were 3,534 Croats (out of 5,086 inhabitants), in 1991 2,589 (out of 3,319), by the end of the 1990s around 400, in 2008 - 300, in 2011 - 237 to 270. During and after the Kosovo War, most of the community had fled to Croatia. 1998 estimations had their number at only 1,800, of which 350 lived in Janjevo. The Croatian government has planned to resettle the remaining Janjevci in Kosovo to Croatia. According to the Kosovan 2011 census, there was a total of ca. 400 Janjevci, of whom 80 remain in the Vitia municipality.

==Janjevci community in Croatia==
Janjevci families started migrating to SR Croatia, part of Yugoslavia, in the 1950s, mostly settling in Zagreb. By the beginning of the 1970s, there was a large community of Janjevci along and within the vicinity of Konjšćinska Street in Dubrava, a district in the eastern part of Zagreb. They have since turned this area into a vibrant shopping district. They are widely known as goldsmiths and merchants and recognised for their craftsmanship (&quot;kujundžijstvo&quot;).

During the Yugoslav Wars, a significant part of the Janjevci emigrated to Croatia in several waves (1992, 1995, 1997, 1999), and Letničani were settled by the authorities in Voćin and Đulovac (western Slavonia) and Janjevci in Kistanje (the Dalmatian hinterland) in the abandoned homes of Serbs. Following the end of the Kosovo War from June to October 1999, the Janjevci population of Kosovo dropped from 700 to 360. Ongoing acts of violence and harassment from Kosovo Albanians and general uncertainty instigated the mass exodus.

In April 2017, 196 displaced Letničani, composed of 41 families who were waiting on homes promised by the state, were finally given newly built houses in the settlement Dumače, in the municipality of Petrinja.

According to records in 2002, there are 966 families of Janjevci in Croatia, with the majority of them residing in the capital Zagreb (669 families), and the rest in other parts of Croatia (297 families).

<text>Lysefjord or Lysefjorden is a fjord located in the Ryfylke area in Rogaland county in southwestern Norway. The long fjord lies in the municipalities of Strand and Sandnes, about east of the city of Stavanger.

The name means &quot;light fjord&quot;, and is said to be derived from the lightly coloured granite rocks along its sides. It is particularly well known for the huge Preikestolen cliff overlooking the fjord, which is a major tourist destination for the region. The fairly isolated village of Lysebotn lies at the eastern end of the fjord and the villages of Forsand and Oanes both lie at the western end of the fjord near the Lysefjord Bridge, the only crossing of the fjord.

==Geology==
The fjord was carved by the action of glaciers in the ice ages and was flooded by the sea when the later glaciers retreated. The geology of Lysefjorden was thoroughly investigated and described by Professor Bjørn G. Andersen in his Master&#x27;s thesis (1954) &quot;(On the glacial retreat in the area between the Lysefjord and the Jøsenfjord in Ryfylke)&quot;.

End to end, it measures with rocky walls falling nearly vertically over into the water. Not only is the fjord long and narrow, it is in places as deep as the mountains are high. Starting at a depth of only deep where it meets the sea near Forsand village, the Lysefjord then heads inland and drops to a depth of over below the Preikestolen.

==Population==
Because of the inhospitable, mountainous terrain, the fjord is only lightly populated and only has two villages on its length - Forsand and Lysebotn, located at opposite ends of the fjord. There is a small farming area on the north shore of the fjord, about halfway between the two ends. That farm area is accessible by road from the village of Årdal over the mountains to the north. There are a few other very small, scattered settlements along the fjord, but those are only accessible by boat along the fjord. There are no roads along the fjord since the sides of the fjord are too steep for roads.

Lysebotn, at the far eastern end of the fjord, is largely populated by workers at the nearby hydroelectric plants at Lyse and Tjodan, both built inside the mountains. At the Lyse plant, the water falls to the turbines, producing up to of electricity. At Tjodan, the water falls to yield an output of . The two power plants provide electricity for more than 100,000 people. A spectacular road which rises almost through a series of 27 hairpin bends including a long hairpin tunnel inside the mountain is the only road access to Lysebotn from the outside world.

==Gallery==
==Tourism==
Lysefjorden is an extremely popular tourist attraction and day trip from the nearby city of Stavanger, from where cruise ships travel the full distance of the fjord. As well as the extraordinary scenery of the fjord itself, two points along its length are popular side trips. The towering cliff of Preikestolen, located above the fjord with a vertical drop of , can be seen from the fjord, but is more impressive from above. At the end of the fjord lies the tall Kjerag mountain, a popular hiking destination with even more spectacular drops. The Kjeragbolten is a famous boulder located at the Kjerag mountain. BASE jumping is legally allowed along the cliffs of the fjord.

==&quot;Toilers of the Sea&quot;==
French writer Victor Hugo wrote the novel, Toilers of the Sea, in which he admires the scenery of the fjord after a visit here in 1866.

<text>John Brown (July 12, 1784 – October 13, 1858) was a Scottish minister and theologian, known for his exegesis as a preacher.

==Life==
The grandson of John Brown of Haddington, he was born at Whitburn, Linlithgowshire. He studied at Glasgow university, and afterwards at the divinity hall of the Burgher branch of the Secession church at Selkirk, under George Lawson. In 1806 he was ordained minister of the Burgher congregation at Biggar, Lanarkshire, where he laboured for sixteen years. While there he had a controversy with Robert Owen the socialist.

Transferred in 1822 to the charge of Rose Street church, Edinburgh, he at once took a high rank as a preacher. In 1829 he succeeded James Hall at Broughton Place church, Edinburgh. In. 1835 he was appointed one of the professors in the theological hall of the Secession church. The first in Scotland to use in the pulpit the exegetical method of exposition of Scripture, and as a professor he illustrated the method and extended its use. To him chiefly is due the abandonment of the principle of interpretation according to the analogy of faith, which practically subordinated the Bible to the creed. He had a considerable share in the Apocrypha controversy; and he was throughout life a vigorous and consistent upholder of anti-state-church or voluntary views. He supported the separation of church and state.

In Edinburgh an impost called the annuity tax was levied for the support of the city&#x27;s Church of Scotland ministers. This Brown finally refused to pay, whereupon in 1838 his goods were twice seized and sold. His two sermons on &quot;The Law of Christ&quot; respecting civil obedience, especially in the payment of tribute, called forth by this grievance and the controversy it engendered, were later published with extensive additions and notes. The part he took in the discussion on the Atonement, which agitated all the Scottish churches, led to a formal charge of heresy against him by those who held the doctrine of a limited atonement. In 1845, after a protracted trial, he was acquitted by the synod.

From that time he enjoyed the thorough confidence of his denomination (after 1847 merged in the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland), of which in his later years he was generally regarded as the leading representative.

In later life he lived in Arthur Lodge, an impressive Georgian villa in the Newington district.

==Family==

He was married to Jane Nimmo (d.1816). Their children included Dr John Brown. His second wife was Margaret Fisher Crum, mother of Alexander Crum Brown.

==Works==
His major works were:

*&quot;Expository Discourses on First Peter&quot; (1848)
*&quot;Exposition of the Discourses and Sayings of our Lord&quot; (1850)
*&quot;Exposition of our Lord&#x27;s Intercessory Prayer&quot; (1850)
*&quot;The Resurrection of Life&quot; (1851)
*&quot;Expository Discourses on Galatians&quot; (1853)
*&quot;Analytical Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans&quot; (1857).
*&quot;An Exposition of the Epistle of the Apostle Paul to the Hebrews&quot; (1862)

<text>The Gate of Supreme Harmony (; Manchu: ; Möllendorff: &quot;amba hūwaliyambure duka&quot;) is the second major gate in the south of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China.

The gate was originally built during the Ming dynasty, when it was called Fengtianmen (奉天門). Following the Manchu conquest of China, the gate was given its present Chinese and Manchu names. The gate burned down in 1886 due to a fire started by a tipped lamp in the guard room. The present gate dates from the rebuilding after this fire, which was completed in 1894.

In the Ming dynasty, the Emperor held morning court sessions at the Gate of Supreme Harmony to discuss state affairs with his ministers, although throughout most of the Ming dynasty the court sessions were purely ceremonial, a demonstration of the Emperor&#x27;s diligence and the status of the titular first minister. In the Qing dynasty, when the Emperor attended court far more frequently, morning court sessions were held at the Gate of Heavenly Purity, which is much closer to the Emperor&#x27;s living quarters. The Gate of Supreme Harmony was used occasionally for banquets and other ceremonies.

The gate is three bays deep and seven bays wide, covering a total area of . It is flanked by two minor gates, Zhendu Gate to the west and Zhaode Gate to the east. The gate and the Meridian Gate form the north and south boundaries of a great plaza that is divided by a serpentine waterway, the Inner River of the Golden Water, which is spanned by a set of five bridges. On the north (inner) side of the gate is Harmony Square, leading to the grand Hall of Supreme Harmony, the ceremonial centre of the Forbidden City.

Many incense burners are arrayed around the stairs. The central stairway was reserved exclusively for the Emperor and his immediate attendants, as was the central entrance of Meridian Gate.

<text>Lizz Winstead (born August 5, 1961) is an American comedian, radio and television personality, abortion rights activist, and podcast host. A native of Minnesota, Winstead is the co-creator of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; along with Madeleine Smithberg, and served as head writer and one of the original correspondents. Winstead is the founder and chief creative officer of Abortion Access Front, a nonprofit made up of “activists, writers and producers and comedians that uses humor to destigmatize abortion” and fight against anti-abortion forces nationwide.

==Early life==
Winstead was the youngest child born into a conservative Catholic family in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

==Career==
Winstead made her standup comedy debut in 1983 in Minneapolis at the Brave New Workshop. She was a national headlining comedian appearing on shows like HBO&#x27;s &quot;Women of the Night&quot; and the Aspen Comedy Festival. She wrote and performed for early Comedy Central shows like &quot;Women Aloud&quot;, and produced the syndicated talk series &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;, starring the future &quot;Daily Show&quot; host. She also created Court TV&#x27;s &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; and served as the consulting producer on the pilot of &quot;The Man Show&quot;.

During her time at &quot;The Daily Show&quot; she helped staff the program with signature talents like Stephen Colbert, Beth Littleford, Brian Unger, and Lewis Black. After &quot;Daily Show&quot; host Craig Kilborn publicly made offensive remarks about Winstead, she left the show in January 1998.

Winstead has appeared on various shows on CNN and MSNBC. In 2002, she and Brian Unger created, wrote and co-hosted &quot;O2Be&quot;, a satire of network morning programs that was broadcast on the Oxygen network.

In 2003, she co-founded and served as the program director at Air America Radio. Until March 2005, she was also co-host of &quot;Unfiltered&quot; on Air America Radio, along with Rachel Maddow and Chuck D.

In 2006, she served as the executive producer of the &quot;Weekends with Maury and Connie&quot; program on MSNBC. The show was canceled later that year and in the last episode Connie Chung performed a musical number with lyrics by Winstead that was called &quot;Thanks for the Memories.&quot; Since 2007, she has produced and hosted a live show in New York City called &quot;Shoot the Messenger&quot;, a satirical wrap-up of the week&#x27;s news as seen through the eyes of six-hour morning show &quot;Wake Up World&quot;, and featuring interviews with such media notables as Rachel Maddow, Sarah Silverman, Chuck D., Amy Goodman, Susie Essman, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. 

On May 10, 2012, her first book, &quot;Lizz Free or Die&quot;, was published by Riverhead Hardcover; it is a collection of autobiographical essays on her life. In 2015, she founded Lady Parts Justice League, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that changed its name in 2019 to Abortion Access Front to become more inclusive to people of all genders who need reproductive care. Abortion Access Front is dedicated to using humor to expose anti-abortion forces, support abortion providers, and expand access to abortion in all 50 states.

Winstead co-hosts the Abortion Access Front podcast “Feminist Buzzkills Live!”, which “break[s] down the weekly news from patriarchy’s evil trilogy of misogyny, white supremacy, and anti-abortion extremism.”

On July 17, 2022, a month after Roe v. Wade was overturned, Winstead and Abortion Access Front along with 60 partners launched Operation Save Abortion, an ongoing campaign beginning with a daylong virtual training session for thousands of new abortion rights activists nationwide. Winstead told Cosmopolitan: “They’ll learn about all the different ways they can channel their outrage into action, they’ll come away knowing this fight requires every single one of us, and they’ll know exactly where their special talents fit into that equation.”

According to Winstead, over 10,000 people participated on the first day. Operation Save Abortion maintains an activist toolkit and calendar to help new abortion activists stay involved.

<doc id="564640" wikidata="Q7759400" url="?curid=564640" title="The Randi Rhodes Show">
<text>The Randi Rhodes Show is a talk radio show hosted by Randi Rhodes. The show combines her progressive political commentary with listener participation and live interviews. It was originally broadcast on Air America Radio, Nova M Radio, and Premiere Networks. The show ended with Premiere on May 16, 2014. The show returned on Monday, June 6, 2016 as a podcast through www.randirhodes.com.

== History ==

&quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; was a local program on WIOD in Miami in 1992 and moved to WJNO in West Palm Beach, Florida in 1994. On March 31, 2004, the program made its national debut on the Air America Radio network. In 2005, the Anti-Defamation League reprimanded Rhodes for comparing Hurricane Katrina refugees with Holocaust victims. The show ran for four hours until September 2006, when it was reduced to three hours.

=== Suspension ===
Despite what Air America stated, Randi Rhodes contended that she was not suspended for comments made about Hillary Clinton.
In an appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; following her departure from Air America, Rhodes explained that the reason for her suspension was not really about the stand-up performance, but rather a ploy to force Rhodes to renegotiate her contract. Rhodes alleged that unless she renegotiated her contract to remove a right in her contract that did not allow Air America to fire her, she would never be permitted to return to the air. Air America suspended her until a settlement could be reached concerning the contract which was still in place and had an additional year to run. In the interim, Air America management decided to conduct market research to assess her value to the company. According to Rhodes, it was Air America who issued the press release that called attention to the video of her performance in San Francisco simply as a way to gauge her audience loyalty and her value to the network. According to Rhodes, Air America soon asked her to return to the air, with an offer of more money but still holding to the condition that she had to amend her contract. Rhodes refused and left Air America because of the stalemate over the new contract.

On April 9, 2008, Air America Radio CEO Charlie Kireker issued a press release stating that Rhodes was leaving the network, in the aftermath of a brief suspension following a controversial live appearance in San Francisco. One of her affiliates, KKGN in San Francisco, California, immediately announced that they would continue airing her show.

=== Nova M Radio (2008-09)===

On April 10, 2008, Nova M Radio announced that &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; would join its radio network, which also syndicated &quot;The Mike Malloy Show&quot;. During the first broadcast on April 14, 2008, Rhodes went into detail concerning the events surrounding her suspension. She described what happened as &quot;a great radio story and I&#x27;ve heard some great radio stories in my day.&quot; The Randi Rhodes show returned to the airwaves on April 21, 2008 on 23 affiliate stations, compared to Air America&#x27;s 60 affiliates. As of May 5, 2008, the show was heard on 28 stations, including XM 167, the Air America channel on XM Radio.

She also reiterated in this same episode that the issue with Air America was primarily about Air America&#x27;s new owners demanding her contract be amended to remove her walk-away clause, and that another issue was her high salary.

However, Rhodes stopped broadcasting on Nova M on February 3, 2009, with shows hosted by Nancy Skinner until the closing of the network. A statement from one of the Nova M network owners appeared on their official website, but offered no explanation, claiming terms of Rhodes&#x27; contract. &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; Web site was temporarily inaccessible on February 16, 2009 but returned online later that day with the following statement:

Nova M ceased operations a few days later.

=== Premiere Radio Networks (2009-14)===

On April 23, 2009, &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; became part of the Premiere Radio Networks affiliate network. Premiere announced that Rhodes would be joining the network beginning May 11, 2009, and would air daily in the 3-6 PM Eastern time slot. The show was based out of Washington, D.C. and can be heard on XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s &#x27;Talk Radio&#x27; channel 168.

In March 2010, WJNO replaced Rhodes with &quot;The Schnitt Show&quot;, and WBZT began carrying the Rhodes show live in her local West Palm Beach area. WJNO continued to play Randi Rhodes on tape delay in evenings.

&quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; ended on May 16, 2014.

=== Dark Horse Broadcasting (June 2016)===
As of February 11, 2016, Randi Rhodes started a Kickstarter campaign to return, this time her show appears to not be returning to radio, but live streaming on the internet. Her Kickstarter campaign raised $152,064. According to her Kickstarter page entry on May 5, 2016, the Randi Rhodes Show returned on Monday, June 6, 2016. Construction of new studios in South Florida delayed her first broadcast.

The Randi Rhodes Show can now be heard and seen live weekdays from 3 to 5pm ET via Periscope, Progressive Voices Network with their app and Randi&#x27;s - YouTube, Facebook, Tunein pages, as a paid podcast to subscribers, and is also available on Free Speech TV - DishTV (ch. 9415), DirecTV (ch. 348), Roku, AppleTV &amp; Sling.
The following radio stations have the Randi Rhodes Show on tape deal: 
Minneapolis, MN: 950 KTFN (10p-Mid.)[19.]
San Bernardino: 102.3/1050 KCAA (2-3p) [20.]

<doc id="564641" wikidata="Q1423137" url="?curid=564641" title="Virtual ground">
<text>In electronics, a virtual ground (or virtual earth) is a node of a circuit that is maintained at a steady reference potential, without being connected directly to the reference potential. In some cases the reference potential is considered to be that of the surface of the earth, and the reference node is called &quot;ground&quot; or &quot;earth&quot; as a consequence. 

The virtual ground concept aids circuit analysis in operational amplifiers and other circuits and provides useful practical circuit effects that would be difficult to achieve in other ways. 

In circuit theory, a node may have any value of current or voltage but physical implementations of a virtual ground will have limitations in terms of current handling ability and a non-zero impedance which may have practical side effects.

==Construction==
A voltage divider, using two resistors, can be used to create a virtual ground node. If two voltage sources are connected in series with two resistors, it can be shown that the midpoint becomes a virtual ground if

:formula_1


An active virtual ground circuit is sometimes called a rail splitter. Such a circuit uses an op-amp or some other circuit element that has gain. Since an operational amplifier has very high open-loop gain, the potential difference between its inputs tends to zero when a feedback network is implemented. 
This means that the output supplies the inverting input (via the feedback network) with enough voltage to reduce the potential difference between the inputs to microvolts. More precisely, it can be shown that the output voltage of the amplifier in the figure is approximately equal to formula_2. 
Thus, as far as the amplifier is working in its linear region (output not saturated, frequencies inside the range of the opamp), the voltage at the inverting input terminal remains constant with respect to the real ground, and independent from the loads to which the output may be connected. 
This property is characterized a &quot;virtual ground&quot;.

== Applications ==

Voltage is a differential quantity, which appears between two points. In order to deal only with a voltage (an electrical potential) of a single point, the second point has to be connected to a reference point (ground). Usually, the power supply terminals serve as steady grounds; when the internal points of compound power sources are accessible, they can also serve as real grounds.

If there are no accessible source internal points, external circuit points with steady voltage relative to the source terminals can serve as artificial &quot;virtual grounds&quot;. Such a point has to have steady potential, which does not vary when a load is attached.

The district, encompassing about 60% of the county&#x27;s area is located northeast of Stavanger and east of Haugesund. It includes the mainland, which is northeast and east of the Boknafjorden and east of the Høgsfjorden. It also consists of the islands on the south side of the Boknafjorden. To the east, Ryfylke borders the districts of Setesdal and Sirdal, to the south is Jæren, and to the west is Haugalandet. Ryfylke is one of the 15 districts in Western Norway.

Ryfylke comprises the contemporary municipalities of Sauda, Suldal, Hjelmeland, Strand, Kvitsøy, the eastern island portion of Stavanger, the Forsand part of Sandnes, and eastern Gjesdal. There are no large cities in Ryfylke, but there are two large towns, Sauda and Jørpeland. 

Scenic attractions include the Lysefjord with the mountains of Preikestolen (&quot;Pulpit Rock&quot;) and Kjerag. The landscape of Ryfylke is characterized by high mountains in the interior; the highest and wildest are located in the north and are formed by hard, igneous rock.

At Haukalivatnet Lake (near Lysefjorden), there is a distinct end moraine presumably created by a prehistoric glacier. This moraine led professor Jens Esmark (in 1824) to formulate the theory of an ice age over Scandinavia and other parts of the world. Esmark believed that climate change due to changes in Earth&#x27;s orbit caused the ice ages.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Rygjafylki&quot;. The first element is the genitive plural of &quot;rygir&quot;, which means &quot;person that eats rye&quot;, and the last element is &quot;fylke&quot;, which means &quot;people&quot; and has the same origin as German &quot;volk&quot;.

<text>Martin Professional (&quot;Harman Professional Denmark ApS&quot;) is a Danish manufacturer and distributor of stage and architectural lighting and effects fixtures. It is owned by Harman International Industries, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics. The company is based in Aarhus, Denmark.

==History==
The history of Martin began in 1978 when founder Peter Johansen realized how to make a smoke generator from a coffee maker. The company was founded in Aarhus in 1986 and began producing primarily fog machines and a small selection of disco lights in 1987. Its name was acquired through cooperation with a French smoke machine company.

In 1993 Martin established Mach, an audio unit.

In 1994 the revenue exceeded 100 million Danish kroner and in 1995 the company was listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, raising a net value of 85.5 million Danish kroner. In 1999, Danish industrial firm Schouw &amp; Co. purchased a 60 percent stake in the company. By 2001, Schouw had fully acquired Martin and delisted it from the stock exchange. Martin expanded production in 2002 through a new factory in Frederikshavn, and a year later the company began outsourcing production to China at a factory in Zhuhai.

In 2006 Mach Audio was phased out.

Martin enjoyed continued growth until 2008 but was hit hard by the financial crisis and reported a loss of more than 200 million Danish kroner in 2009 and had layoffs of 130 employees at their production sites in Frederikshavn.

Continued innovation especially within LED technology has helped the company through the crisis and resulted in several product awards.
In 2010 the Confederation of Danish Industries awarded with its annual product price for the MAC 350 Entour LED based automated lighting fixture. The LED technology used in the product was a result of a three-year collaboration with Aalborg University. Furthermore, the MAC Aura luminaire and MAC Viper Profile won the PLASA award for innovation in 2011 and 2012 respectively. Martin started moving its production back to Denmark in the first half of 2012 their factory in Frederikshavn with 26 new employees. The move was made possible by a reduced labor demand in Martins new production lines.

===Under Harman===
In 2013 Harman International Industries completed the acquisition of Martin from Schouw. The acquisition did not include the two factories in Frederikshavn, but included an agreement to rent the buildings from Schouw. The acquisition led to the release of the Mach brand which was sold to a cooperation of Canadian and Hong Kong investors. They relaunched the brand under its own company.

In August 2015 Harman announced the intention to close the factory in Frederikshavn. The closure was completed on 31 March 2016.

In March 2018 the M-Series range of lighting controllers and software were acquired by Elation Professial. Harman sees lightning as the core product. Since then Martin belongs to Harman Professional Solutions.

==Today==
Martin has been displayed both a number of major international events such as the 2001 Eurovision song contest in Copenhagen, the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and at
the Beijing 2008 summer olympics where Martin was the main provider of automated lighting with over 1100 luminaries at the opening ceremony.
Furthermore, Martin is one of the chief technology companies in the Aarhus area, and has a strategic partnership with Aarhus University School of Engineering.

==Products==
Early on, Martin specialized in fog effect machines; They produced few lighting fixtures. In 1993, the company started producing the Mach series of live sound products, which were quickly discontinued. By 1997, the company realized its full potential as a leading manufacturer in the emerging market of DMX intelligent stage lighting products with the launch of the MAC 500 and 600.

Martin&#x27;s most prominent product to date is the MAC 2000 moving head fixture. It is used primarily by large theaters, concert producers and major television networks and production companies.

In addition to moving heads, Martin also manufactures flat mirror and rotating drum-style scanners, strobes, color changers, semi-intelligent effects, LED fixtures, controllers for Intelligent lighting, media servers and a line of smoke machines.

Martin&#x27;s current product line includes the Martin MAC Viper, the LED MAC Quantum series and MAC Aura and the RUSH DJ range, a successor to the Martin Mania range.

Another of Martin&#x27;s current product line is the Era series featuring the era 400 performance, the era 500 hybrid up, the era 600 performance, the era 300 profile and the era 800 performance.

In October 2018 the LED moving head MAC Allure Profile was launched.

<text>Luigj Gurakuqi (19 February 1879 – 2 March 1925), also called Louis Gurakuchi, was an Albanian writer and politician. He was an important figure of the Albanian National Awakening and was honored with the People&#x27;s Hero of Albania medal.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gurakuqi was born to a Catholic family in Shkodër, a vilayet center of the Ottoman Empire at the time, on February 19, 1879. He studied at the Jesuit-run St. Xavier College He was also a poet and published under the pen name &quot;Jakin Shkodra&quot; and &quot;Lekë Gruda&quot;. He published articles in &quot;Albania&quot;, &quot;Drita&quot;, &quot;Kalendari-kombëtar&quot;, &quot;Liria e Shqipërisë&quot;, and &quot;La Nazione Albanese&quot;.

===Albanian independence===
By September 1912, Gurakuqi and Ismail Kemal traveled to Bucharest to consult with the large Albanian diaspora regarding Albanian geopolitical issues.

===Principality of Albania and Noli&#x27;s Government===
In 1924 Gurakuqi was one of the leaders of the revolution that overthrew the regime of Ahmet Zogu and established a democratic government. Fan S. Noli became the new prime minister, while Luigj Gurakuqi was part of the new cabinet as Minister of Economy and Finance.

===Exile and death===
After the restoration of the Zogist regime, Gurakuqi lived in Bari, Italy, where he was murdered in a café by Balto Stambolla.

Balto Stambolla was extradited back to his homeland in 1942 during the Italian occupation of Albania, by a personal request from Mustafa Merlika-Kruja. He then ordered the prison guards of Fier to murder Stambolla. This was done in order to avenge Gurakuqi.

==Honors==
Luigj Gurakuqi was awarded the titles &quot;Hero i Popullit&quot; (Hero of the People) and &quot;Mësues i Popullit&quot; (Teacher of the People). A statue of him stands in the center of Shkodër.

<doc id="564661" wikidata="Q2702296" url="?curid=564661" title="Video game producer">
<text>A video game producer is the top person in charge of overseeing development of a video game.

==History==
The earliest documented use of the term &quot;producer&quot; in games was by Trip Hawkins, who established the position when he founded Electronic Arts in 1982:

Sierra On-Line&#x27;s 1982 computer game &quot;Time Zone&quot; may be the first to list credits for &quot;Producer&quot; and &quot;Executive Producer&quot;. As of late 1983 Electronic Arts had five producers: A product marketer and two others from Hawkins&#x27; former employer Apple (&quot;good at working with engineering people&quot;), one former IBM salesman and executive recruiter, and one product marketer from Automated Simulations; it popularized the use of the title in the industry. Hawkins&#x27; vision—influenced by his relationship with Jerry Moss—was that producers would manage artists and repertoire in the same way as in the music business, and Hawkins brought in record producers from A&amp;M Records to help train those first producers. Activision made Brad Fregger their first producer in April 1983.

Although the term is an industry standard today, it was dismissed as &quot;imitation Hollywood&quot; by many game executives and press members at the time. Over its entire history, the role of the video game producer has been defined in a wide range of ways by different companies and different teams, and there are a variety of positions within the industry referred to as &quot;producer&quot;.

There are relatively few superstars of game production that parallel those in film, in part because top producers are usually employed by publishers who choose to play down publicizing their contributions. Unlike many of their counterparts in film or music, these producers do not run their own independent companies.

== Types of producers ==
Most video and computer games are developed by third-party developers. In these cases, there may be external and internal producers. External producers may act as &quot;executive producers&quot; and are employed by the game&#x27;s publisher. Internal producers work for the developer itself and have more of a hands-on role. Some game developers may have no internal producers, however, and may rely solely on the publisher&#x27;s producer.

For an internal producer, associate producers tend to specialize in an area of expertise depending on the team they are producing for and what skills they have a background in. These specializations include but are not limited to: programming, design, art, sound, and quality assurance. A normal producer is usually the project manager and is in charge of delivering the product to the publisher on time and on budget. An executive producer will be managing all of the products in the company and making sure that the games are on track to meet their goals and stay within the company&#x27;s goals and direction.

For an external producer, their job responsibilities may focus mainly on overseeing several projects being worked on by a number of developers. While keeping updated on the progress of the games being developed externally, they inform the upper management of the publisher of the status of the pending projects and any problems they may be experiencing. If a publisher&#x27;s producer is overseeing a game being developed internally, their role is more akin to that of an internal producer and will generally only work on one game or a few small games.

As games have grown larger and more expensive, line producers have become part of some teams. Based on filmmaking traditions, line producers focus on project scheduling and costing to ensure titles are completed on time and on budget.

== Responsibilities ==
An internal producer is heavily involved in the development of, usually, a single game. Responsibilities for this position vary from company to company, but in general, the person in this position has the following duties:
* Negotiating contracts, including licensing deals
* Acting as a liaison between the development staff and the upper stakeholders (publisher or executive staff)
* Developing and maintaining schedules and budgets
* Overseeing creative (art and design) and technical development (game programming) of the game
* Ensuring timely delivery of deliverables (such as milestones)
* Scheduling timely quality assurance (testing)
* Arranging for beta testing and focus groups, if applicable
* Arranging for localization
* Pitching game ideas to publishers

In short, the internal producer is ultimately responsible for timely delivery and final quality of the game.

For small games, the producer may interact directly with the programming and creative staff. For larger games, the producer will seek the assistance of the lead programmer, art lead, game designer and testing lead. While it is customary for the producer to meet with the entire development staff from time to time, for larger games, they will only meet with the leads on a regular basis to keep updated on the development status. In smaller studios, a producer may fill any slack in the production team by doing the odd job of writing the game manual or producing game assets.

For most games, the producer does not have a large role but does have some influence on the development of the video game design. While not a game designer, the producer has to weave the wishes of the publisher or upper management into the design. They usually seek the assistance of the game designer in this effort. So the final game design is a result the effort of the designer and some influence of the producer.

== Compensation ==
In general, video game producers earn the third most out of game development positions, behind business (management) and programmers.
According to an annual survey of salaries in the industry, producers earn an average of USD$75,000 annually. A video game producer with less than 3 years of experience makes, on average, around $55,000 annually. A video game producer with more than 6 years of experience makes, on average, over $125,000 annually. The salaries of a video game producer will vary depending on the region and the studio.

==Education==

Most video game producers complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in game design, computer science, digital media or business. Popular computer programming languages for video game development include C, C++, Assembly, C# and Java. Some common courses are communications, mathematics, accounting, art, digital modeling and animation.

Employers typically require three plus years of experience, since a producer has to have gone through the development cycle several times to really understand how unpredictable the business is. The most common path to becoming a video game producer begins by first working as a game tester, then moving up the quality assurance ladder, and then eventually on to production. This is easier to accomplish if one stays with the same studio, reaping the benefits of having built relationships with the production department.

<doc id="564669" wikidata="Q559213" url="?curid=564669" title="Thomas Sydenham">
<text>Thomas Sydenham (10 September 1624 – 29 December 1689) was an English physician. He was the author of &quot;Observationes Medicae&quot; (1676) which became a standard textbook of medicine for two centuries so that he became known as &#x27;The English Hippocrates&#x27;. Among his many achievements was the discovery of a disease, Sydenham&#x27;s chorea, also known as St Vitus&#x27; Dance. To him is attributed the prescient dictum, &quot;A man is as old as his arteries.&quot;

==Early life==
Thomas Sydenham was born at Wynford Eagle in Dorset, where his father was a gentleman of property. His brother was Colonel William Sydenham.

At the age of eighteen Sydenham attended Magdalen Hall, Oxford; after a short period his college studies appear to have been interrupted, and he served for a time as an officer in the Parliamentarian army during the Civil War. He completed his Oxford course in 1648, graduating as bachelor of medicine, and about the same time he was elected a fellow of All Souls College. It was not until nearly thirty years later (1676) that he graduated as MD, not at Oxford, but at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where his eldest son was by then an undergraduate.

After 1648 he seems to have spent some time studying medicine at Oxford, where he cites the physician Thomas Coxe as an important influence - Coxe was caring for his brother. But he was soon back in military service, and in 1654 he received the sum of £600, as a result of a petition he addressed to Oliver Cromwell, pointing out the various arrears due to two of his brothers who had been killed and reminding Cromwell that he himself had also faithfully served the parliament with the loss of much blood.

In 1655 he resigned his fellowship at All Souls and married Mary Gee in his home village of Wynford Eagle. They had two sons, William (–1738) and Henry (1668?–1741); another son, James, apparently died young. In 1663 he passed the examinations of the College of Physicians for their licence to practice in Westminster and 6 miles round; but it is probable that he had been settled in London for some time before that. This minimum qualification to practice was the single bond between Sydenham and the College of Physicians throughout the whole of his career.

He seems to have been distrusted by some members of the faculty because he was an innovator and something of a plain-dealer. In a letter to John Mapletoft he refers to a class of detractors &quot;qui vitio statim vertunt si quis novi aliquid, ab illis non-prius dictum vel etiam inauditum, in medium proferat&quot; (&quot;Who by a technicality suddenly turn if something is new, if someone should disclose something not previously said or heard&quot;); and in a letter to Robert Boyle, written the year before his death (and the only authentic specimen of his English composition that remains), he says, &quot;I have the happiness of curing my patients, at least of having it said concerning me that few miscarry under me; but [I] cannot brag of my correspondency with some other of my faculty ... Though yet, in taken fire at my attempts to reduce practice to a greater easiness, plainness, and in the meantime letting the mountebank at Charing Cross pass unrailed at, they contradict themselves, and would make the world believe I may prove more considerable than they would have me.&quot;

Sydenham attracted to his support some of the most discriminating men of his time, such as Boyle and John Locke. His religious views have been described as an early form of natural theology.

==Works and innovations==

===Published works===

His first book, &#x27; (&quot;The Method of Curing Fevers&quot;), was published in 1666; a second edition, with an additional chapter on the plague, in 1668; and a third edition, further enlarged and bearing the better-known title of &#x27; (&quot;Observations of Medicine&quot;), in 1676. His next publication was in 1680 in the form of two &quot;&quot; (&quot;Letters &amp; Replies&quot;), the one, &quot;On Epidemics&quot;, addressed to Robert Brady, Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge, and the other, &quot;On the Lues venerea&quot;, (&quot;On Venereal Diseases&quot;) to Henry Paman, public orator at Cambridge and Gresham Professor of Physic in London.

In 1682 he published another &quot;Dissertatio epistolaris&quot; (&quot;Dissertation on the Letters&quot;), on the treatment of confluent smallpox and on hysteria, addressed to Dr William Cole of Worcester. The &#x27; (&quot;The Management of Arthritis and Dropsy&quot;) came out in 1683, and the &#x27; (&quot;The Schedule of Symptoms of the Newly Arrived Fever&quot;) in 1686. His last completed work, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Process of Healing&quot;), is an outline sketch of pathology and practice; twenty copies of it were printed in 1692, and, being a compendium, it has been republished more often both in England and in other countries than any other of his writings separately. A fragment on pulmonary consumption was found among his papers. His collected writings occupy about 600 pages 8vo, in the Latin, translated into that language by various scholars.

===Father of English medicine===
Although Sydenham was a successful practitioner and witnessed, besides foreign reprints, more than one new edition of his various treatises called for in his lifetime, his fame as the father of English medicine, or the English Hippocrates, was posthumous. For a long time he was held in vague esteem for the success of his cooling (or rather expectant) treatment of smallpox, for his laudanum (the first form of a tincture of opium), and for his advocacy of the use of &quot;Peruvian bark&quot; in &quot;quartan agues&quot; (in modern terms, the use of quinine-containing cinchona bark for treatment of malaria caused by &quot;Plasmodium malariae&quot;). There were, however, those among his contemporaries who understood something of Sydenham&#x27;s importance in larger matters than details of treatment and pharmacy, among them Richard Morton and Thomas Browne who owned copies of several of Sydenham&#x27;s books.

But the attitude of the academical medicine of the day is doubtless indicated in Martin Lister&#x27;s use of the term sectaries for Sydenham and his admirers, at a time (1694) when the leader had been dead five years. If there were any suspicion that the opposition to him was quite other than political, it would be set at rest by the testimony of Dr Andrew Brown, who went from Scotland to inquire into Sydenham&#x27;s practice and has incidentally revealed what was commonly thought of it at the time, in his Vindicatory Schedule concerning the &quot;New Cure of Fevers&quot;. In the series of Harveian Orations at the College of Physicians, Sydenham is first mentioned in the oration of Dr John Arbuthnot (1727), who styles him &quot;aemulus Hippocratis&quot; (&quot;rival of Hippocrates&quot;). Herman Boerhaave, the Leyden professor, was wont to speak of him in his class (which had always some pupils from England and Scotland) as &quot;Angliae lumen, artis Phoebum, veram Hippocratici viri speciem&quot; (&quot;The light of England, the skill of Apollo, the true face of Hippocrates&quot;). Albrecht von Haller also marked one of the epochs in his scheme of medical progress with the name of Sydenham. He is indeed famous because he inaugurated a new method and a better ethics of practice, the worth and diffusive influence of which did not become obvious (except to those who were on the same line with himself, such as Morton) until a good many years afterwards. It remains to consider briefly what his innovations were.

First and foremost he did the best he could for his patients, and made as little as possible of the mysteries and traditional dogmas of the craft. Stories told of him are characteristic: Called to a gentleman who had been subjected to the lowering treatment, and finding him in a pitiful state of hysterical upset, he conceived that this was occasioned partly by his long illness, partly by the previous evacuations, and partly by emptiness. &quot;I therefore ordered him a roast chicken and a pint of canary.&quot; A gentleman of fortune he diagnosed with hypochondria was at length told he could do no more for him, but that there was living at Inverness a certain Dr Robertson who had great skill in cases like his; the patient journeyed to Inverness full of hope, and, finding no doctor of the name there, came back to London full of rage, but cured withal of his complaint.

Of a piece with this is his famous advice to Sir Richard Blackmore. When Blackmore first engaged in the study of physic he inquired of Dr Sydenham what authors he should read, and was directed by that physician to &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, which, said he, &quot;is a very good book; I read it still.&quot; There were cases, he tells us, in his practice where &quot;I have consulted my patients&#x27; safety and my own reputation most effectually by doing nothing at all.&quot;

In 1679, Sydenham gave Whooping cough the name pertussis, meaning a violent cough of any type. A zealous Puritan, &quot;he rejected on religious grounds attempts such as pathological anatomy and microscopic analysis to uncover the hidden causes of disease,&quot; arguing that &quot;God only gave man the ability to perceive the outer nature of things with his senses.&quot;

===Quotations and Attributions===
&quot;Of all the remedies it has pleased almighty God to give man to relieve his suffering, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium.&quot;

&quot;A man is as old as his arteries.&quot;

&quot;The arrival of a good clown exercises a more beneficial influence upon the health of a town than of twenty asses laden with drugs.&quot;

&quot;I confidently affirm that the greater part of those who are supposed to have died of gout, have died of the medicine rather than the disease - a statement in which I am supported by observation.&quot;

&quot;For humble individuals like myself, there is one poor comfort, which is this, viz. that gout, unlike any other disease, kills more rich men than poor, more wise men than simple. Great kings, emperors, generals, admirals, and philosophers have all died of gout. Hereby Nature shows her impartiality: since those whom she favors in one way she afflicts in another - a mixture of good and evil pre-eminently adapted to our frail mortality.&quot;

&quot;It becomes every man who purposes to give himself to the care of others, seriously to consider the four following things: First, that he must one day give an account to the Supreme Judge of all the lives entrusted to his care. Secondly, that all his skill, and knowledge, and energy as they have been given him by God, so they should be exercised for his glory, and the good of mankind, and not for mere gain or ambition. Thirdly, and not more beautifully than truly, let him reflect that he has undertaken the care of no mean creature, for, in order that he may estimate the value, the greatness of the human race, the only begotten Son of God became himself a man, and thus ennobled it with his divine dignity, and far more than this, died to redeem it. And fourthly, that the doctor being himself a mortal man, should be diligent and tender in relieving his suffering patients, inasmuch as he himself must one day be a like sufferer.&quot;

The aphorism &quot;Primum non nocere&quot; (First, do no harm), often misattributed to Hippocrates, is attributed to Sydenham in a book written by the English surgeon Thomas Inman, but this attribution is not authenticated by Sydenham&#x27;s available works.

===Nosology===
Sydenham&#x27;s fundamental idea was to take diseases as they presented themselves in nature and to draw up a complete picture (&quot;Krankheitsbild&quot; of the Germans) of the objective characters of each. Most forms of ill-health, he insisted, had a definite type, comparable to the types of animal and vegetable species. The conformity of type in the symptoms and course of a malady was due to the uniformity of the cause. The causes that he dwelt upon were the evident and conjunct causes, or, in other words, the morbid phenomena; the remote causes he thought it vain to seek after.

Acute diseases, such as fevers and inflammations, he regarded as a wholesome conservative effort or reaction of the organism to meet the blow of some injurious influence operating from without; in this he followed the Hippocratic teaching closely as well as the Hippocratic practice of watching and aiding the natural crises. Chronic diseases, on the other hand, were a depraved state of the humours, mostly due to errors of diet and general manner of life, for which we ourselves were directly accountable. Hence his famous dictum: &quot;acutos dico, qui ut plurimum Deum habent authorem, sicut chronici ipsos nos&quot; (&quot;I say what hurts, most over which God has authority, just like we ourselves over the chronic&quot;).

Sydenham&#x27;s nosological method is essentially the modern one, except that it lacked the morbid anatomy part, which was first introduced into the natural history of disease by Morgagni nearly a century later. In both departments of nosology, the acute and the chronic, Sydenham contributed largely to the natural history by his own accurate observation and philosophical comparison of case with case and type with type. The &quot;Observationes medicae&quot; and the first &quot;Epistola responsoria&quot; contain evidence of a close study of the various fevers, fluxes and other acute maladies of London over a series of years, their differences from year to year and from season to season, together with references to the prevailing weather, the whole body of observations being used to illustrate the doctrine of the epidemic constitution of the year or season, which he considered to depend often upon inscrutable telluric causes. The type of the acute disease varied, he found, according to the year and season, and the right treatment could not be adopted until the type was known.

There had been nothing quite like this in medical literature since the Hippocratic treatise, &quot;On Airs, Waters and Places&quot;; and there are probably some germs of truth in it still undeveloped, although the modern science of epidemiology has introduced a whole new set of considerations. Among other things Sydenham is credited with the first diagnosis of scarlatina and with the modern definition, of chorea (in &quot;Sched. monit.&quot;). After smallpox, the diseases to which he refers most are hysteria and gout, his description of the latter (from the symptoms in his own person) being one of the classical pieces of medical writing. While Sydenham&#x27;s natural history method has doubtless been the chief ground of his great posthumous fame, there can be no question that another reason for the admiration of posterity was that which is indicated by RG Latham, when he says, &quot;I believe that the moral element of a liberal and candid spirit went hand in hand with the intellectual qualifications of observation, analysis and comparison.&quot;

==Death==
Hardly anything is known of Sydenham&#x27;s personal history in London. He died at his house in Pall Mall on 29 December 1689, aged 65. He is buried in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly, where a mural slab was put up by the College of Physicians in 1810.

A memorial stone dedicated to Thomas can be found halfway up the staircase of St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. It was put there by the now-defunct &quot;Sydenham Society&quot;.

==Biographies==
Among the lives of Sydenham are one (anonymous) by Samuel Johnson in John Swan&#x27;s translation of his works (London, 1742), another by C. G. Kühn in his edition of his works (Leipzig, 1827), and a third by Robert Gordon Latham in his translation of his works published in London by the Sydenham Society in 1848. See also Frédéric Picard, &quot;Sydenham, sa vie, ses œuvres&quot; (Paris, 1889), and Joseph Frank Payne, &quot;Thomas Sydenham&quot; (London, 1900). Dr John Brown&#x27;s &quot;Locke and Sydenham&quot;, in &quot;Hores subsecivae&quot; (Edinburgh, 1858), is of the nature of eulogy. Many collected editions of his works have been published, as well as translations into English, German, French and Italian. William Alexander Greenhill published the Latin text (London, 1844, Syd. Soc.).

The most interesting summary of doctrine and practice by the author himself is the introduction to the 3rd edition of &quot;Observationes medicae&quot; (1676). A colleague, Dr John Browne, described him as &quot;the prince of practical medicine, whose character is as beautiful and as genuinely English as his name&quot;.

<text>The English football league system, also known as the football pyramid, is a series of interconnected leagues for men&#x27;s association football clubs in England, with five teams from Wales, one from Guernsey, one from Jersey and one from the Isle of Man also competing. The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels, allowing even the smallest club the theoretical possibility of ultimately rising to the very top of the system, the Premier League. Below that are levels 2–4 organised by the English Football League, then the National League System from levels 5–10 administered by the FA, and thereafter Regional feeder leagues run by relevant county FAs on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. It also often happens that the Premier Division of a Regional Feeder League (Step 7 or Level 11) has its constitution given to it by the FA. They have to accept it or appeal but cannot reject it at an annual general meeting.

The exact number of clubs varies from year to year as clubs join and leave leagues, merge, or fold altogether, but an estimated average of 15 clubs per division implies that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are members of a league in the English men&#x27;s football league system.

The pyramid for women&#x27;s football in England runs separately into ten tiers. There are no official definitions of any level below 11 for men or below 10 for women. Any references to the structure at lower levels should not be regarded as definitive. 

Some England-based men&#x27;s clubs play outside the English football league system.

==History==

The world&#x27;s first association football league, named simply The Football League, was created in 1888 by Aston Villa&#x27;s club director William McGregor. It was dominated by those clubs who had supported professionalism. The twelve founding members were six from Lancashire (Accrington, Blackburn Rovers, Burnley, Bolton Wanderers, Everton and Preston North End) and six from the Midlands (Aston Villa, Derby County, Notts County, Stoke, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers).

==About the system==
The system consists of a pyramid of leagues, bound together by the principle of promotion and relegation. A certain number of the most successful clubs in each league can rise to a higher league, whilst those that finish the season at the bottom of their league can be sent down a level. In addition to sporting performance, promotion is usually contingent on meeting criteria set by the higher league, especially concerning appropriate facilities and finances.

In theory, it is possible for a lowly local amateur club to achieve annual promotions and within a few years rise to the pinnacle of the English game and become champions of the Premier League. While this may be unlikely in practice (at the very least, in the short run), there certainly is significant movement within the pyramid.

The top five levels contain one division each and are nationwide in scope. Below this, the levels have progressively more parallel leagues, with each covering progressively smaller geographic areas. Many leagues have more than one division. At the lower levels the existence of leagues becomes intermittent, although in some of the more densely populated areas there are leagues more than twenty layers below the Premier League. There are also leagues in various parts of the country which are not officially part of the system as they do not have formal agreements with other leagues, but are recognised at various levels by county football associations. Clubs from these leagues may, if they feel they meet the appropriate standard of play and have suitable facilities, apply to join a league which does form part of the system.

The six levels immediately below the Premier League and three-level English Football League are known as the National League System and come under the jurisdiction of The Football Association. In May 2014 The FA announced provisional plans for a new division between the English Football League and the National League which would include &quot;B&quot; teams of higher-level clubs. They later reneged on the plan to include Premier League &quot;B&quot; teams in the new division and shortly thereafter scrapped the idea altogether.

The English football league system does not include the amateur version of the game often called Sunday league football. These leagues are independent entities with no promotion or relegation involving the football pyramid. However, some Sunday league clubs have been known to join pyramid leagues if they desire to progress higher. There are also some Saturday leagues which are not officially part of the pyramid, although teams frequently leave these for pyramid leagues.

==Structure==
The FA Premier League was founded on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. As a result at the top is the single division of the Premier League (level 1, which is often referred to as the &quot;top flight&quot;), containing 20 clubs. Below the Premier League is the English Football League (EFL) (formerly &#x27;the Football League&#x27;), which is divided into three divisions of 24 clubs each: The Championship (level 2), League One (level 3), and League Two (level 4). The 20 clubs in the Premier League and 72 clubs in the English Football League are all full-time professional clubs. Before the establishment of the Premier League in 1992, the Football League, as it was called then, included all 92 clubs, in four divisions. Clubs outside the Football League were referred to as non-League clubs, and this naming continues for clubs below the four professional divisions.

The top tier of non-League football is the National League. It contains a nationwide division (also called the National League) (level 5) of 24 clubs, and is the lowest level with a single nationwide league. This division, like the four above, is a full-time professional competition, although some promoted clubs retain part-time status. There are two divisions at level 6, covering the north (National League North) and south (National League South), with 24 clubs each. Some of these clubs are full-time professional and the others are semi-professional. Below level 6, some of the stronger clubs are semi-professional, but continuing down the tiers, soon all the clubs are amateur.

Below the National League are three regional leagues at levels 7 and 8, each covering different parts of England, though with some geographical overlap. These are the Northern Premier League (covering northern England), the Southern Football League (serving the Midlands, southern, and southwestern England, with one club from South Wales) and the Isthmian League (including clubs from southeastern England as well as Guernsey in the Channel Islands). The Southern League manages two parallel Premier Divisions at level 7 and two lower divisions at level 8. The Northern Premier League and Isthmian League each administer one Premier Division at level 7 and three level 8 divisions. All divisions typically consist of 22 teams.

Level 9 contains the top divisions of a large group of 16 sub-regional leagues. Each of these leagues has a different divisional setup, but they all have one thing in common: there are yet more leagues below them, each covering smaller and smaller geographical levels.

==Promotion and relegation rules for the top eight levels==

#Premier League (level 1, 20 teams): The bottom three teams are relegated.
#English Football League Championship (level 2, 24 teams): Top two automatically promoted; next four compete in the play-offs, with the winner gaining the third promotion spot. The bottom three are relegated.
#English Football League One (level 3, 24 teams): Top two are automatically promoted; next four compete in play-offs, with the winner gaining the third promotion spot. The bottom four are relegated.
#English Football League Two (level 4, 24 teams): Top three teams are automatically promoted; next four compete in play-offs, with the winner gaining the fourth promotion spot. The bottom two are relegated.
#National League (level 5, 24 teams): The champions are promoted; next six compete in play-offs, with the winner gaining the second promotion spot. The bottom four are relegated to either North or South division as appropriate.
#National League North and National League South (level 6, 24 teams each, running in parallel): The champions in each division are automatically promoted; next six teams in each division compete in play-offs, with the play-off winner in each division getting the second promotion spot, with four teams qualifying to the National League in total. The bottom four teams in each division relegated to either Northern Premier League, Southern League or Isthmian League as appropriate. If, after promotion and relegation, the number of teams in the North and South divisions is not equal, one or more teams are transferred between the two divisions to even them up again based on geographic factors.
#Northern Premier League Premier Division, Southern Football League Premier Central, Southern Football League Premier South, and Isthmian League Premier Division (level 7, 22 teams each, leagues running in parallel): The champions in each division are automatically promoted; next four teams in each division compete in play-offs, with the play-off winners also promoted. The bottom four teams in each division relegated to a level 8 division as appropriate. If, after promotion and relegation, the number of teams in the divisions is not equal, one or more teams are transferred among the four divisions to even them up again.
#Northern Premier League Division One East, Northern Premier League Division One Midlands, Northern Premier League Division One West, Southern Football League Division One East, Southern Football League Division One West, Isthmian League Division One North, Isthmian League Division One South Central and Isthmian League Division One South East (level 8, running in parallel, 22 teams in each division): The champions in each division are automatically promoted; next four teams in each division compete in play-offs, with the play-off winners also promoted. The bottom four teams in each division are relegated to a level 9 division as appropriate. If, after promotion and relegation, the number of teams in the divisions is not equal, one or more teams are transferred between the divisions to even them up again.

==Cup eligibility==
Being members of a league at a particular level also affects eligibility for Cup, or single-elimination, competitions.
*FA Cup: Levels 1 to 10 &quot;(Teams from Levels 1 to 4 qualify automatically for the main competition, teams from Levels 5 to 10 enter the qualifying rounds)&quot;
*EFL Cup: Levels 1 to 4
*EFL Trophy: Levels 3 to 4 &quot;(16 U21 teams from clubs in Levels 1 and 2 compete since 2016–17)&quot;
*FA Trophy: Levels 5 to 8
*FA Vase: Levels 9 to 10
*FA Inter-League Cup: Level 11 &quot;(contested by representative teams from each league)&quot;
*National League Cup: Level 5 &quot;(16 U21 teams from clubs in Levels 1 and 2 also compete)&quot;

In the case of the FA Cup, entrance from Level 10 clubs depends upon ranking within the league the club is in, and depends on the number of Level 9 clubs participating. For instance, the 2017–18 FA Cup saw 77 teams compete from level 10 out of the 338 in total at that level.

Below level 11 the pyramid becomes regional and the cups become accordingly regional. Further down the pyramid is split on a county basis, counties having their own cups accordingly. This excludes some tournaments marked &quot;Senior Cups&quot;, which often are competitions between teams representing top professional clubs in a given district, and may be little more than derbies, such as the Gloucestershire Cup, which originally included all teams in Gloucestershire, but then came to be contested as a Bristol derby.

==The system==
Level one in the pyramid, the top division of English football, is run by the Premier League (which gives its name to the competition in that division), the winners of which are regarded as the champions of England. Levels two to four are run by the English Football League. Together, these four divisions make up what is known as &quot;league football&quot;.

The leagues below level four are classed as &quot;non-League football&quot;, meaning they are outside the EFL. The leagues at levels five to ten comprise the National League System (NLS), and come under the direct jurisdiction of the Football Association. The top level (level 5) of the NLS is known as &quot;step 1&quot;, the next (level 6) as &quot;step 2&quot;, and so on. Until 2020, level 11 divisions were designated as &quot;step 7&quot;, but that year were re-designated as &quot;Regional Feeder Leagues&quot;.

After the 2023–24 season, four runners-up competed in the play-offs where an additional club was guaranteed promotion from each step 5 division, with the number of relegations from each of the eight level 8 divisions remained at two as each step 4 division increased its divisional size to 22 teams. The resulting 16 vacancies at step 5 were filled by relegating only one club per level 9 division, rather than two. Ahead of 2024–25, two promotions out of each step 5 division into its step 4 counterpart remained and the number of clubs automatically relegated out of each step 5 division reverted to two, reflecting a long-term FA aim to &quot;create consistency&quot; at each step of the NLS pyramid.

The system is only defined as far as level 11. What follows is a notional structure, based on which leagues promote and relegate to each other.

<text>Edward Patrick Francis Eagan (April 26, 1897 – June 14, 1967) was an American athlete who won a gold medal as a light-heavyweight boxer at the 1920 Summer Olympics and a gold medal in four-man bobsled at the 1932 Winter Olympics. Few athletes have competed in both the Summer and Winter Olympic games; Eagan is the only one to have won gold in each in different events.

==Early life==

Eagan was born into a modest family in Denver, Colorado. He graduated from Longmont High School and attended college at Denver University for one year, during which time he won the western middleweight boxing title. During World War I he was an artillery lieutenant and was the middleweight champion of the American Expeditionary Forces. After the war he attended Yale University. In 1919, he won the AAU&#x27;s heavyweight title. After graduating from Yale in 1921, Eagan attended Harvard Law School and the University of Oxford. In 1923 he won Amateur Boxing Association heavyweight title.

Eagan wrote in his autobiography about how he had modeled his behavior after Frank Merriwell, a fictional athlete from Yale who was the subject of hundreds of widely read dime novels: &quot;To this day I have never used tobacco, because Frank Merriwell didn&#x27;t. My first glass of wine, which I do not care for, was taken under social compulsion in Europe. Frank never drank.&quot;

==Olympics==
===Summer Olympics===
In 1920, he competed as a boxer at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and won the gold medal in the light-heavyweight division. He also competed at the 1924 Summer Olympics, but this time as a heavyweight. He failed to medal, having lost in the first round to Arthur Clifton (see Boxing at the 1924 Summer Olympics - Men&#x27;s heavyweight).

===Winter Olympics===
Eagan returned to the Olympics eight years later, this time as a member of the bobsled crew of Billy Fiske, who steered to victory at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. Eagan became the first of six Olympians to medal in both the Winter and Summer Games, followed by Jacob Tullin Thams (Norway), Christa Luding-Rothenburger (East Germany), Clara Hughes (Canada), and Lauryn Williams (United States). Eddy Alvarez joined Eagan and Williams in 2020 as the only Americans to win medals in both the Winter and Summer Olympics. Eagan is one of two competitors to win gold in both Olympic seasons (the other being Gillis Grafström whose only summer gold was in figure skating).

In 1927 Eagan married Margaret Colgate, who was a member of the family that founded Colgate-Palmolive. In 1932 he was admitted to the New York bar and began a career in private practice. He spent five years as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York before joining the United States Army Air Forces. During World War II, he served in the Air Transport Command and visited nearly every place where the Army had planes. He retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel and earned numerous decorations. After the war, Eagan was appointed chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. He resigned in 1951 to focus on his law practice.

Eddie Eagan set a world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe by scheduled airlines on December 13, 1948. He traveled 20,559 miles stopping at 18 different stations and beat the previous record by 20 hours and 15 minutes.

He died at age 70 in New York City and was interred at Greenwood Union Cemetery.

<text>An abstract strategy game is a type of strategy game that has minimal or no narrative theme, an outcome determined only by player choice (with minimal or no randomness), and in which each player has perfect information about the game. For example, Go is a pure abstract strategy game since it fulfills all three criteria; chess and related games are nearly so but feature a recognizable theme of ancient warfare; and Stratego is borderline since it is deterministic, loosely based on 19th-century Napoleonic warfare, and features concealed information.

==Definition==

Combinatorial games have no randomizers such as dice, no simultaneous movement, nor hidden information. Some games that do have these elements are sometimes classified as abstract strategy games. (Games such as &quot;Continuo&quot;, Octiles, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot;, and Sequence, could be considered abstract strategy games, despite having a luck or bluffing element.) A smaller category of abstract strategy games manages to incorporate hidden information without using any random elements; the best known example is &quot;Stratego&quot;.

Traditional abstract strategy games are often treated as a separate game category, hence the term &#x27;abstract games&#x27; is often used for competitions that exclude them and can be thought of as referring to &quot;modern&quot; abstract strategy games. Two examples are the IAGO World Tour (2007–2010) and the Abstract Games World Championship held annually since 2008 as part of the Mind Sports Olympiad.

Some abstract strategy games have multiple starting positions of which it is required that one be randomly determined. For a game to be one of skill, a starting position needs to be chosen by impartial means. Some games, such as &quot;Arimaa&quot; and &quot;DVONN&quot;, have the players build the starting position in a separate initial phase which itself conforms strictly to combinatorial game principles. Most players, however, would consider that although one is then starting each game from a different position, the game itself contains no luck element. Indeed, Bobby Fischer promoted randomization of the starting position in chess in order to &quot;increase&quot; player dependence on thinking at the board.
As J. Mark Thompson wrote in his article &quot;Defining the Abstract&quot;, play is sometimes said to resemble a series of puzzles the players pose to each other: There is an intimate relationship between such games and puzzles: every board position presents the player with the puzzle, What is the best move?, which in theory could be solved by logic alone. A good abstract game can therefore be thought of as a &quot;family&quot; of potentially interesting logic puzzles, and the play consists of each player posing such a puzzle to the other. Good players are the ones who find the most difficult puzzles to present to their opponents.

Many abstract strategy games also happen to be &quot;combinatorial&quot;; i.e., there is no hidden information, no non-deterministic elements (such as shuffled cards or dice rolls), no simultaneous or hidden movement or setup, and (usually) two players or teams take a finite number of alternating .

Many games which are abstract in nature historically might have developed from thematic games, such as representation of military tactics. In turn, it is common to see thematic version of such games; for example, chess is considered an abstract game, but many thematic versions, such as Star Wars-themed chess, exist.

There are also many abstract video games, which include open ended solutions to problems, one example is &quot;Shapez&quot;, a game which you must deliver a set amount of shapes, but it is entirely up to you how to do so.

== History ==

Mancala is among the oldest known games to still be widely played today. Chess is believed to have originated in northwest India, in the Gupta Empire ( 280–550), where its early form in the 6th century was known as &quot;chaturaṅga&quot; (), literally &quot;four divisions&quot; [of the military] – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. &quot;Chaturanga&quot; was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board, called &quot;ashtāpada&quot;. Shogi was the earliest chess variant to allow captured pieces to be returned to the board by the capturing player. This drop rule is speculated to have been invented in the 15th century and possibly connected to the practice of 15th century mercenaries switching loyalties when captured instead of being killed.

As civilization advanced and societies evolved, so too did strategy board games. New inventions such as printing technology in the 15th century allowed for mass production of game sets, making them more accessible to people from various social classes. Games like backgammon and mancala became popular during this time, showcasing different styles of strategic gameplay.

A board resembling a Draughts board was found in Ur dating from 3000 BC, found by British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley in the 1920s. In the British Museum are specimens of ancient Egyptian checkerboards, found with their pieces in burial chambers, and the game was played by Queen Hatasu. Plato mentioned a game, πεττεία or &quot;&quot;, as being of Egyptian origin, and Homer also mentions it. The game was later imported into the Roman Empire under the name &quot;ludus latrunculorum.&quot;

Go was considered one of the four essential arts of the cultured aristocratic Chinese scholars in antiquity. The earliest written reference to the game is generally recognized as the historical annal &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; (c. 4th century BC).

Englishmen Lewis Waterman and John W. Mollett both claim to have invented the game of Reversi in 1883, each denouncing the other as a fraud. The game gained considerable popularity in England at the end of the nineteenth century. The game&#x27;s first reliable mention is on 21 August 1886 edition of &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;.

After the end of World War 2, these games became more complex. Risk (game) and Diplomacy (game) were released in the 1950s. &quot;Risk&quot; saw the player try to conquer the world from other players after claiming land at the start of the game, while &quot;Diplomacy&quot; saw the player go back to Europe during the time just before The Great War, to build alliances with other players, as to secure his safety and victory.

== Comparison ==
Analysis of &quot;pure&quot; abstract strategy games is the subject of combinatorial game theory. Abstract strategy games with hidden information, bluffing, or simultaneous move elements are better served by Von Neumann–Morgenstern game theory, while those with a component of luck may require probability theory incorporated into either of the above.

As for the qualitative aspects, ranking abstract strategy games according to their interest, complexity, or strategy levels is a daunting task and subject to extreme subjectivity. In terms of measuring how finite a mathematical field each of the three top contenders represents, it is estimated that checkers has a game-tree complexity of 1040 possible games, whereas chess has approximately 10123. As for Go, the possible legal game positions range in the magnitude of 10170.

==Champions==
The Mind Sports Olympiad first held the &quot;Abstract Games World Championship&quot; in 2008 to try to find the best abstract strategy games all-rounder. The MSO event saw a change in format in 2011 restricting the competition to players&#x27; five best events, and was renamed the &quot;Modern Abstract Games World Championship&quot;.

<doc id="564679" wikidata="Q2462636" url="?curid=564679" title="Carterton, Oxfordshire">
<text>Carterton is a town in West Oxfordshire district in the county of Oxfordshire, England and is south-west of Witney. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 15,769.

==History==
Much of what is now the northern part of the town was held by the Moleyns family from at least 1369, but in 1429 William Lord Moleyns was killed at the siege of Orléans and the land passed to the Hungerford family. During the medieval period the main road through Carterton was one of the most important in the country, taking trains of packhorses laden with Cotswold wool over Radcot Bridge and on to Southampton for export to the weaving centre of Europe. In the 1770s the land was acquired by the Duke of Marlborough.

The pattern of the present settlement dates from 1894 when part of the estate was sold to Homesteads Limited whose director was William Carter. The land was divided into plots of 6 acres and sold for £20 an acre with bungalows costing from £120. Many of the settlers were retired soldiers and people moving from the towns. Carterton soon made its name in the market gardening world. Black grapes from Frenchester Nurseries and the famous Carterton tomatoes were sold at Covent Garden Market.

Carterton, which by the late 20th century was one of the largest towns in Oxfordshire, was founded soon after 1900 as a colony of smallholders, on agricultural land in the northern part of Black Bourton parish. The founder was William Carter of Branksome (Dorset), a speculator who, through his company Homesteads Ltd of London, bought estates in several counties, in order to establish smallholdings and attract people back to the land. In Oxfordshire he acquired from W. C. Arkell, in 1900, the 740-a. Rock farm north of Black Bourton village, part of an estate sold by the duke of Marlborough in 1894. By late 1902 there were 16 houses, and the following year the new settlement, already called Carterton, was included in a local trades directory.

=== Development from the Second World War ===
Carterton&#x27;s later growth was closely related to the construction in 1937 of the nearby RAF Brize Norton airbase. This development profoundly altered the settlement&#x27;s character as Brize Norton became the Royal Air Force&#x27;s largest operating base. A small group of substantial two-storey houses for RAF personnel, called Brizewood, was built east of Swinbrook Road about 1938, and in the 1950s was expanded with uniform bungalows for American servicemen. By 1953 Carterton was a &quot;busy and expanding village&quot;, and its rapid population increase was creating severe housing problems: in 1962 the plight of significant numbers of caravan dwellers prompted an article in the &quot;Lancet&quot;, though many residents took exception to the town&#x27;s portrayal, and denied that the picture was typical. By then there were claimed to be more civilians than servicemen living in mobile homes, some of them single women, and the &quot;shack-like houses of the early settlers&quot;, their &quot;meagre appearance [bearing] eloquen&quot; elsewhere on the &quot;busy village main street&quot;. 

A few scattered &quot;Robin&quot; hangars, hastily built during the Second World War to allow aircraft to be housed away from the airfield itself, were converted to other uses during the same period, one on Alvescot Road surviving in the early 21st century as part of a motor repair garage. Rock Farm and its converted agricultural buildings, all stone-built, survived as a small group at the intersection of Lawton and Arkell Avenues, with William Wilkinson&#x27;s pair of model labourers&#x27; cottages set back from the Alvescot road between modern housing. In 1967 an ambitious scheme was launched for controlled expansion and for regeneration of the town centre, with a ring road (Upavon Way) to serve new housing, to divert traffic from the centre, and to contain future expansion. New RAF housing was to provide over 1,450 dwellings and private enterprise another 300, while local authorities were to provide shops and other much needed facilities around the central crossroads. A reduced scheme for the town centre was launched in 1975 after repeated delays and controversy, and Upavon Way was opened soon after.

By 1976 over 2,000 houses had been built since the 1960s, those on the large estates in the north-east mostly of uniform appearance with concrete exteriors, and 850 more were planned. Settlement by then spilled over the parish boundary into Brize Norton, though on the north there was no expansion beyond the parish boundary, and expansion south of Milestone Road was constrained by the airfield perimeter. A large transit hotel within the airfield precinct was built by the RAF in 1970 to serve military personnel and their families. The number of people in mobile homes still caused controversy in 1980, when there were almost 250 permanent or temporary pitches distributed among several sites, and in the early 1980s some sites were closed and replaced by council houses. Expansion in the town&#x27;s eastern part, chiefly for housing, continued in the mid 1980s. 

By 1997 the town centre had been transformed: shops in a variety of styles lined the four broad main streets, interspersed with a few older buildings such as the Beehive Hotel and the former Emporium, and the crossroads was dominated by a tall domed tower built in 1996, surmounting new shops and offices. A large Co-operative Society supermarket of flamboyant design, on the site of the earlier building on Black Bourton Road, was erected in 1998, and in 2000 work began on a major expansion programme on the town&#x27;s eastern edge, to include another 1,200 houses, a shopping centre, leisure facilities, and a new access road. A variety of early settlers&#x27; houses also survived scattered among the modern buildings, though by 2004 several had been recently demolished or were semiderelict and under threat from developers, prompting mounting local controversy.

== Public buildings and social provision ==

In the late 1960s a new police station was built on Burford Road for a staff of eight, together with six police houses, and the original police house was demolished. A war memorial erected at the crossroads about 1920 was moved to the new town hall on Alvescot Road which was completed in 1983. A reading room mentioned in 1917 was succeeded by a small library also in part of the former Emporium. Refreshment rooms were mentioned in 1924, the Beehive Hotel on Burford Road was opened in 1932, and the Golden Eagle (renamed the Olde Aviator in 1996) was opened in the former Emporium in 1954. 

Land for a recreation ground north of Alvescot Road was given by Carter in 1906, and football, cricket, tennis, and bowls clubs were formed around 1920, together with a choral society. From 1904 to the 1920s there was a resident physician, and in 1928 a solicitor visited once a week. Construction work on RAF Brize Norton began in 1935. Wartime saw the rapid growth of the base. An air raid destroyed 46 aircraft; the remainder were then dispersed round the village and one hangar which is now an Aldi supermarket on the Alvescot Road. From 1950 to 1965 the camp was to be the home of the USAF bomber wings. The RAF returned in 1965 and undertook a large building programme, making RAF Brize Norton its main air transport base in the country. 

Carterton Town Hall was built south of Alvescot Road in 1982–3. With the growth of the village, the small mission church at the central crossroads was replaced in 1963 by the church of St John the Evangelist. The link with the mother church of St. Mary&#x27;s at Black Bourton was kept alive by the donation of one of the bells from the tower. This was made by H. Knight of Reading and is dated 1619. 

In the first decade of the 21st century, the new Shilton Park development in Northeast Carterton was built, providing a mix of housing for private ownership and social letting. The new St. John&#x27;s Church of England primary school has been built at Shilton Park and construction of a local shopping centre is now complete. A new Memorial Garden has been built near the town to continue the public mourning seen at Royal Wootton Bassett as military repatriations for dead service personnel have now been routed to Brize Norton.
==Governance==
The grandfather of Theo Walcott, Windell &quot;Joe&quot; Walcott (1926–2018), was council chairman between 2002 and 2006 and mayor of Carterton from 2000 to 2002. He was awarded an MBE in 2006 for his services to the community in Carterton and West Oxfordshire.

<doc id="564685" wikidata="Q2720568" url="?curid=564685" title="Digital control">
<text>Digital control is a branch of control theory that uses digital computers to act as system controllers.
Depending on the requirements, a digital control system can take the form of a microcontroller to an ASIC to a standard desktop computer.
Since a digital computer is a discrete system, the Laplace transform is replaced with the Z-transform. Since a digital computer has finite precision (&quot;See quantization&quot;), extra care is needed to ensure the error in coefficients, analog-to-digital conversion, digital-to-analog conversion, etc. are not producing undesired or unplanned effects.

Since the creation of the first digital computer in the early 1940s the price of digital computers has dropped considerably, which has made them key pieces to control systems because they are easy to configure and reconfigure through software, can scale to the limits of the memory or storage space without extra cost, parameters of the program can change with time (&quot;See adaptive control&quot;) and digital computers are much less prone to environmental conditions than capacitors, inductors, etc.

== Digital controller implementation ==
A digital controller is usually cascaded with the plant in a feedback system. The rest of the system can either be digital or analog.

Typically, a digital controller requires:
*Analog-to-digital conversion to convert analog inputs to machine-readable (digital) format
*Digital-to-analog conversion to convert digital outputs to a form that can be input to a plant (analog)
*A program that relates the outputs to the inputs

=== Output program ===
*Outputs from the digital controller are functions of current and past input samples, as well as past output samples - this can be implemented by storing relevant values of input and output in registers. The output can then be formed by a weighted sum of these stored values.

The programs can take numerous forms and perform many functions
*A digital filter for low-pass filtering
*A state space model of a system to act as a state observer
*A telemetry system

=== Stability ===
Although a controller may be stable when implemented as an analog controller, it could be unstable when implemented as a digital controller due to a large sampling interval. During sampling the aliasing modifies the cutoff parameters. Thus the sample rate characterizes the transient response and stability of the compensated system, and must update the values at the controller input often enough so as to not cause instability.

When substituting the frequency into the z operator, regular stability criteria still apply to discrete control systems. Nyquist criteria apply to z-domain transfer functions as well as being general for complex valued functions. Bode stability criteria apply similarly.
Jury criterion determines the discrete system stability about its characteristic polynomial.

=== Design of digital controller in s-domain ===
The digital controller can also be designed in the s-domain (continuous). The Tustin transformation can transform the continuous compensator to the respective digital compensator. The digital compensator will achieve an output that approaches the output of its respective analog controller as the sampling interval is decreased.

formula_1

==== Tustin transformation deduction ====
Tustin is the Padé(1,1) approximation of the exponential function formula_2 :

: formula_3

And its inverse

: formula_4

Digital control theory is the technique to design strategies in discrete time, (and/or) quantized amplitude (and/or) in (binary) coded form to be implemented in computer systems (microcontrollers, microprocessors) that will control the analog (continuous in time and amplitude) dynamics of analog systems. From this consideration many errors from classical digital control were identified and solved and new methods were proposed:

*Marcelo Tredinnick and Marcelo Souza and their new type of analog-digital mapping
*Yutaka Yamamoto and his &quot;lifting function space model&quot;
*Alexander Sesekin and his studies about impulsive systems.
*M.U. Akhmetov and his studies about impulsive and pulse control

=== Design of digital controller in z-domain ===
The digital controller can also be designed in the z-domain (discrete). The Pulse Transfer Function (PTF) formula_5 represents the digital viewpoint of the continuous process formula_6 when interfaced with appropriate ADC and DAC, and for a specified sample time formula_7 is obtained as:

formula_8

Where formula_9 denotes z-Transform for the chosen sample time formula_7. There are many ways to directly design a digital controller formula_11 to achieve a given specification. For a type-0 system under unity negative feedback control, Michael Short and colleagues have shown that a relatively simple but effective method to synthesize a controller for a given (monic) closed-loop denominator polynomial formula_12 and preserve the (scaled) zeros of the PTF numerator formula_13 is to use the design equation:

formula_14

Where the scalar term formula_15 ensures the controller formula_11 exhibits integral action, and a steady-state gain of unity is achieved in the closed-loop. The resulting closed-loop discrete transfer function from the z-Transform of reference input formula_17 to the z-Transform of process output formula_18 is then given by:

formula_19

Since process time delay manifests as leading co-efficient(s) of zero in the process PTF numerator formula_13, the synthesis method above inherently yields a predictive controller if any such delay is present in the continuous plant.

<text>Phalerum or Phaleron ( &quot;&quot; ; &quot;()&quot;, ) was a port of Ancient Athens, 5 km southwest of the Acropolis of Athens, on a bay of the Saronic Gulf. The bay is also referred to as &quot;Bay of Phalerum&quot; ( &quot;).&quot;

The area of Phalerum is now occupied by the towns Palaio Faliro, Kallithea, Moschato and Neo Faliro, all of which are part of the Athens agglomeration.

Phalerum was the major port of Athens before Themistocles had the three rocky natural harbours by the promontory of Piraeus developed as alternative, from 491 BC. It was said that Menestheus set sail with his fleet to Troy from Phalerum, as did Theseus when he sailed to Crete after the death of Androgeus.

Recently, archaeologists have uncovered what appear to be traces of ancient Athens’s first port before the city’s naval and shipping centre was moved to Piraeus. The site, some 350 m from the modern coastline, contained pottery, tracks from the carts that would have served the port, and makeshift fireplaces where travelers waiting to take ship would have cooked and kept warm.

The Park of Maritime Tradition, a collection of preserved historic ships, is located at the site. At the southern tip is the permanent anchorage of the armored cruiser &quot;HS Averof&quot; (now a floating museum), which was the admiralty ship of the Hellenic Navy during the Balkan Wars and World War I. Other museum ships include the Hellenic Navy destroyer &quot;HS Velos&quot; (D16), the old cable ship &quot;Thalis o Milisios&quot; (Thales of Miletos) and &quot;Olympias&quot;, a modern reconstruction of an ancient trireme naval ship.

<doc id="564692" wikidata="Q1163304" url="?curid=564692" title="Relative strength index">
<text>The relative strength index (RSI) is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets. It is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period. The indicator should not be confused with relative strength.

The RSI is classified as a momentum oscillator, measuring the velocity and magnitude of price movements. Momentum is the rate of the rise or fall in price. The relative strength RS is given as the ratio of higher closes to lower closes. Concretely, one computes two averages of absolute values of closing price changes, i.e. two sums involving the sizes of candles in a candle chart. The RSI computes momentum as the ratio of higher closes to overall closes: stocks which have had more or stronger positive changes have a higher RSI than stocks which have had more or stronger negative changes.

The RSI is most typically used on a 14-day timeframe, measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with high and low levels marked at 70 and 30, respectively. Short or longer timeframes are used for alternately shorter or longer outlooks. High and low levels—80 and 20, or 90 and 10—occur less frequently but indicate stronger momentum.

The relative strength index was developed by J. Welles Wilder and published in a 1978 book, &quot;New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems&quot;, and in &quot;Commodities&quot; magazine (now &quot;Modern Trader&quot; magazine) in the June 1978 issue. It has become one of the most popular oscillator indices.

The RSI provides signals that tell investors to buy when the security or currency is oversold and to sell when it is overbought. 

RSI with recommended parameters and its day-to-day optimization was tested and compared with other strategies in Marek and Šedivá (2017). The testing was randomised in time and companies (e.g., Apple, Exxon Mobil, IBM, Microsoft) and showed that RSI can still produce good results; however, in longer time it is usually overcome by the simple buy-and-hold strategy. 

==Calculation==
For each trading period an upward change &quot;U&quot; or downward change &quot;D&quot; is calculated. Up periods are characterized by the close being higher than the previous close:
:formula_1
:formula_2
Conversely, a down period is characterized by the close being lower than the previous period&#x27;s close,
:formula_3
:formula_4
If the last close is the same as the previous, both &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are zero. Note that both U and D are nonnegative numbers.

Averages are now calculated from sequences of such &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, using an &quot;n&quot;-period smoothed or modified moving average (SMMA or MMA), which is the exponentially smoothed moving average with &quot;α = 1 / n&quot;. Those are positively weighted averages of those positive terms, and behave additively with respect to the partition.

Wilder originally formulated the calculation of the moving average as: &quot;newval = (prevval * (n - 1) + newdata) / n&quot;, which is equivalent to the aforementioned exponential smoothing. So new data is simply divided by &quot;n&quot;, or multiplied by &quot;α&quot; and previous average values are modified by &quot;(n - 1) / n&quot;, i.e. &quot;1 - α&quot;.
Some commercial packages, like AIQ, use a standard exponential moving average (EMA) as the average instead of Wilder&#x27;s SMMA.
The smoothed moving averages should be appropriately initialized with a simple moving average using the first &quot;n&quot; values in the price series.

The ratio of these averages is the &quot;relative strength&quot; or &quot;relative strength factor&quot;:
:formula_5
The relative strength factor is then converted to a relative strength index between 0 and 100:
:formula_6
If the average of &quot;U&quot; values is zero, both RS and RSI are also zero.
If the average of &quot;U&quot; values equals the average of &quot;D&quot; values, the RS is 1 and RSI is 50.
If the average of &quot;U&quot; values is maximal, so that the average of &quot;D&quot; values is zero, then the RS value diverges to infinity, while the RSI is 100.

==Interpretation==

===Basic configuration===
The RSI is presented on a graph above or below the price chart. The indicator has an upper line and a lower line, typically at 70 and 30 respectively, and a dashed mid-line at 50. Wilder recommended a smoothing period of 14 (see exponential smoothing, i.e. &quot;α&quot; = 1/14 or &quot;N&quot; = 14).

===Principles===
Wilder posited that when price moves up very rapidly, at some point it is considered overbought. Likewise, when price falls very rapidly, at some point it is considered oversold. In either case, Wilder deemed a reaction or reversal imminent.

The level of the RSI is a measure of the stock&#x27;s recent trading strength. The slope of the RSI is directly proportional to the velocity of a change in the trend. The distance traveled by the RSI is proportional to the magnitude of the move.

Wilder believed that tops and bottoms are indicated when RSI goes above 70 or drops below 30. Traditionally, RSI readings greater than the 70 level are considered to be in overbought territory, and RSI readings lower than the 30 level are considered to be in oversold territory. In between the 30 and 70 level is considered neutral, with the 50 level a sign of no trend.
===Divergence===
Wilder further believed that divergence between RSI and price action is a very strong indication that a market turning point is imminent. Bearish divergence occurs when price makes a new high but the RSI makes a lower high, thus failing to confirm. Bullish divergence occurs when price makes a new low but RSI makes a higher low.

Furthermore, traders often use &quot;hidden&quot; divergences to indicate possible trend reversals. A hidden bullish divergence occurs when the price makes a lower high, while the RSI makes a higher high. Conversely, a hidden bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher low, but the RSI makes a lower low.

===Overbought and oversold conditions===

Wilder thought that &quot;failure swings&quot; above 50 and below 50 on the RSI are strong indications of market reversals. For example, assume the RSI hits 76, pulls back to 72, then rises to 77. If it falls below 72, Wilder would consider this a &quot;failure swing&quot; above 70.

Finally, Wilder wrote that chart formations and areas of support and resistance could sometimes be more easily seen on the RSI chart as opposed to the price chart. The center line for the relative strength index is 50, which is often seen as both the support and resistance line for the indicator.

===Uptrends and downtrends===

In addition to Wilder&#x27;s original theories of RSI interpretation, Andrew Cardwell has developed several new interpretations of RSI to help determine and confirm trend. First, Cardwell noticed that uptrends generally traded between RSI 40 and 80, while downtrends usually traded between RSI 60 and 20. Cardwell observed when securities change from uptrend to downtrend and vice versa, the RSI will undergo a &quot;range shift.&quot;
Next, Cardwell noted that bearish divergence: 1) only occurs in uptrends, and 2) mostly only leads to a brief correction instead of a reversal in trend. Therefore, bearish divergence is a sign confirming an uptrend. Similarly, bullish divergence is a sign confirming a downtrend.

===Reversals===

Finally, Cardwell discovered the existence of positive and negative reversals in the RSI. Reversals are the opposite of divergence. For example, a positive reversal occurs when an uptrend price correction results in a higher low compared to the last price correction, while RSI results in a lower low compared to the prior correction. A negative reversal happens when a downtrend rally results in a lower high compared to the last downtrend rally, but RSI makes a higher high compared to the prior rally.

In other words, despite stronger momentum as seen by the higher high or lower low in the RSI, price could not make a higher high or lower low. This is evidence the main trend is about to resume. Cardwell noted that positive reversals only happen in uptrends while negative reversals only occur in downtrends, and therefore their existence confirms the trend.

==Cutler&#x27;s RSI==
A variation called Cutler&#x27;s RSI is based on a simple moving average of &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, instead of the exponential average above. Cutler had found that since Wilder used a smoothed moving average to calculate RSI, the value of Wilder&#x27;s RSI depended upon where in the data file his calculations started. Cutler termed this Data Length Dependency. Cutler&#x27;s RSI is not data length dependent, and returns consistent results regardless of the length of, or the starting point within a data file.

: formula_7

Cutler&#x27;s RSI generally comes out slightly different from the normal Wilder RSI, but the two are similar, since SMA and SMMA are also similar.

==General definitions==

In analysis,
* If formula_8 is a real function with positive formula_9-norm on a set formula_10, then formula_11 divided by its norm integral, the normalized function formula_12, is an associated distribution.
* If formula_13 is a distribution, one can evaluate measurable subsets formula_14 of the domain. To this end, the associated indicator function formula_15 may be mapped to an &quot;index&quot; formula_16 in the real unit interval, via the pairing formula_17.

Now for formula_18 defined as being equal to formula_19 if and only if the value of formula_20 is positive, the index formula_21 is a quotient of two integrals and is a value that assigns a weight to the part of formula_20 that is positive. 
A ratio of two averages over the same domain formula_10 is also always computed as the ratio of two integrals or sums.

Yet more specifically, for a real function on an ordered set formula_10 (e.g. a price curve), one may consider that function&#x27;s gradient formula_20, or some weighted variant thereof. In the case where formula_26 is an ordered finite set (e.g. a sequence of timestamps), the gradient is given as the finite difference. 

In the &quot;relative strength index&quot;, formula_27 evaluates a sequence formula_20 derived from closing prices observed in an interval of formula_29 so called market periods formula_30. The positive value formula_31 equals the absolute price change formula_32, i.e. formula_33 at formula_34, multiplied by an exponential factor according to the SMMA weighting for that time. The denominator formula_35 is the sum of all those numbers. In the numerator one computes the SMMA of only formula_36, or in other words formula_20 multiplied by the indicator function for the positive changes. The resulting index in this way weighs formula_36, which includes only the positive changes, over the changes in the whole interval.

<text>Chipping Norton is a market town and civil parish in the Cotswold Hills in the West Oxfordshire district of Oxfordshire, England, about south-west of Banbury and north-west of Oxford. The 2011 Census recorded the civil parish population as 5,719. It was estimated at 6,254 in 2019.

== History ==

===Pre-1800===
The Rollright Stones, a stone circle north of Chipping Norton, reflect prehistoric habitation in the area. The town name means &quot;market north town&quot;, with &quot;Chipping&quot; (from Old English &quot;cēping&quot;) meaning &quot;market&quot;. Chipping Norton began as a small settlement beneath a hill, where the earthworks of the motte-and-bailey Chipping Norton Castle can still be seen. The Church of England parish church dedicated to St Mary the Virgin stands on the hill next to the castle. Parts of today&#x27;s building may date from the 12th century. It retains features of the 13th and 14th centuries. The nave was largely rebuilt in about 1485 with a Perpendicular Gothic clerestory. It is believed to have been funded by John Ashfield, a wool merchant, making St Mary&#x27;s an example of a &quot;wool church&quot;.

In July 1549, the Vicar of Chipping Norton, Henry Joyes or Joyce, led parishioners in a popular rising after the suppression of chantries and other religious reforms left him to minister alone to a congregation of 800 and reduced the budget for schooling. The rising was brutally put down by Lord Grey de Wilton. Joyes was captured, then hanged in chains from the tower of his church. The bell tower rebuilt in 1825 has a ring of eight bells, all cast in 1907 by Mears and Stainbank of Whitechapel Bell Foundry. It also has a Sanctus bell cast in 1624 by Roger I Purdue of Bristol.

Wool in the Middle Ages made the Cotswolds one of England&#x27;s wealthiest parts and many of the medieval buildings survive in the centre of Chipping Norton. There is still a market every Wednesday and a mop fair in September, when the High Street is closed to through traffic. In 1205 a new market place was laid out higher up the hill. Sheep farming was largely displaced by arable, but agriculture remained important. Many original houses round the market place received fashionable Georgian façades in the 18th century. An inscription on the almshouses records them as founded in 1640 as &quot;The work and gift of Henry Cornish, gent&quot;.
In the mid-18th century, extract of willow bark became recognized for its soothing effects on fever, pain, and inflammation after the Revd Edward Stone of Chipping Norton (1702–1768) noticed that the bitter taste of willow bark resembled the taste of the bark of the cinchona tree, known as &quot;Peruvian bark&quot;, which was used successfully in Peru to treat a variety of ailments. Stone experimented with preparations of powdered willow bark on people in the town for five years. He found it to be as effective as Peruvian bark and a cheaper domestic version, and in 1763 he sent a report of his findings to the Royal Society in London. His discovery became the basis of the drug aspirin. A blue plaque commemorating his work is displayed on a building in West Street near the Fox Hotel.

===Post-1800===
In 1796, James and William Hitchman founded Hitchman&#x27;s Brewery in West Street. The business moved in 1849 to a larger brewery in Albion Street that included a malthouse and its own water wells. Three generations of Hitchmans ran this, but in 1890 Alfred Hitchman sold it as a limited company that acquired other breweries in 1891 and 1917. In 1924, it merged with Hunt Edmunds of Banbury; in 1931, the brewery here was closed. Other local industries included a woollen mill (see below), a glove-maker, a tannery and an iron foundry.

Chipping Norton had a workhouse by the 1770s. In 1836 the architect George Wilkinson built a larger one with four wings round an octagonal central building, similar to one he was building at Witney. The architect G. E. Street added a chapel to Chipping Norton workhouse in 1856–1857. The building became a hospital in the Second World War. It was taken over by the National Health Service in 1948 as Cotshill Hospital, later became a psychiatric hospital, and was closed in 1983. It has been redeveloped as private residences.

The Town Hall, designed in the neoclassical style was completed in 1842.

Chipping Norton Railway (CNR) opened in 1855, linking with on the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway. In 1887, a second railway opened to the Oxford and Rugby Railway at and the CNR became part of the Banbury and Cheltenham Direct Railway (B&amp;CDR). Extending the railway from Chipping Norton involved a tunnel long under Elmsfield Farm west of the town. In 1951, British Railways withdrew passenger services between Chipping Norton and . In 1962, it closed the station at Kingham, and two years later the B&amp;CDR to freight, and dismantled the line. The disused railway tunnel is bricked up at both ends for safety and used as a refuge for bats. (&quot;See Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981&quot;)

In May 1873, rioting occurred after the sentencing of the Ascott Martyrs – 16 local women accused of trying to interfere with strikebreakers at a farm. Bliss Tweed Mill in the west of town was built as a tweed mill by William Bliss in 1872. In 1913 to 1914, the millworkers struck for eight months. The mill closed in 1980 and was turned into flats. It remains a landmark, visible from Worcester Road. The neoclassical Holy Trinity Roman Catholic church was built in 1836 by the architect John Adey Repton, grandson of the English garden designer Humphry Repton.


== Governance ==

There are three tiers of local government covering Chipping Norton, at civil parish (town), district and county level: Chipping Norton Town Council, West Oxfordshire District Council and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council meets at the Town Hall and has its offices in the 16th century Guildhall at the opposite end of the Market Place.

Until May 2024, Chipping Norton was in the Witney parliamentary constituency, whose Member of Parliament from 2001 to 2016 was David Cameron, prime minister from 2010 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005. From 2016 to 2024 the MP was the Conservative Robert Courts. Boundary changes for the 2024 general election placed Chipping Norton in the Banbury parliamentary constituency, with new Labour MP Sean Woodcock being elected. One Conservative and two Labour councillors represent the town on West Oxfordshire District Council.

===Administrative history===
Chipping Norton was an ancient parish. It was subdivided into two townships, being Over Norton to the north and a Chipping Norton township covering the rest of the parish to the south, including the town itself. Such townships became separate civil parishes in 1866.

In 1607 the township of Chipping Norton was granted a charter which incorporated it as a borough. Prior to that, the town had been a lower status seigneurial borough, controlled by the lord of the manor. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.

The borough of Chipping Norton was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new West Oxfordshire District Council. A successor parish called Chipping Norton was created covering the area of the abolished borough, with its parish council taking the name Chipping Norton Town Council.

== Amenities ==

The town&#x27;s theatre, The Theatre Chipping Norton, began life as a Salvation Army Citadel, its first stones, now visible in the auditorium, being laid in 1888. It continued as a furniture warehouse before being spotted by two Royal Shakespeare Company actors, Tamara and John Malcolm, in 1968. In 1973, fundraising for the new theatre began in earnest, and a pantomime, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was staged in the town hall. The Theatre was opened in 1975 by Tom Baker (who played the title character, the Doctor, in the BBC science-fiction TV show &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), beginning with a light programme including films and lunchtime jazz. The adjoining cottage was bought and converted into the bar and gallery. In 1990 a building bought in Goddards Lane now serves as green room, offices and rehearsal room.

In 2023, a cinema opened in the town. The Living Room Cinema has two screens as well as a bar.

The town hosts annual arts festivals: Chipping Norton Literary Festival (&#x27;ChipLitFest&#x27;), Chipping Norton Music Festival, and a jazz festival. The Theatre Chipping Norton opened in 1975 as a theatre, cinema, gallery and music venue for original productions and touring companies.

The town acts as a retail and leisure centre, with three supermarkets and numerous shops, including branches of national chain stores. It has six pubs, two hotels with public bars, and three schools. Holy Trinity Roman Catholic School and St Mary&#x27;s Church of England School are primary schools. Chipping Norton School is the town&#x27;s secondary school with a sixth form.

Chipping Norton Golf Club, now the Cotswold Club and part of Cotswold Hotel and Spa, is the oldest in Oxfordshire. It began in 1890 on Chipping Norton Common.

The first XV of Chipping Norton Rugby Union Football Club plays in the Southern Counties North League. It was league champion in 2007/08.

Chipping Norton has a purpose-built veterinary hospital, serving the community and the local zoos. The hospital&#x27;s building was opened in July 2015 by then prime minister David Cameron. The previous premises were on Albion Street, where the practice had been based since it was founded in the 1970s. The hospital has a boarding cattery, a CT Scanner, and hosts one of only 15 radioiodine treatment units for hyperthyroid cats in the UK.

From 1989, the veterinary hospital had a partnership with the remote island of St Helena, using funding provided by the DfID for vets to visit the island. Since 2010, the island has had its own permanent vet and the connection has since been lost.

Chipping Norton Town (&quot;The Magpies&quot; or &quot;Chippy&quot;) was founded in 1893 and plays at Walterbush Road. It resigned from the Hellenic Football League in favour of the Witney &amp; District Football League.

Chipping Norton Town Cricket Club plays in Oxfordshire Cricket Association Division 6. The town also has a bowls club.

The town has a Women&#x27;s Institute, a Rotary Club, and a Lions Club.

== Landmarks ==

===St Mary’s Church===

The nave of St Mary’s Church in Chipping Norton, built circa 1485, is described by Pevsner as being one of the finest interiors in the county. The chancel and aisles are earlier, and contain 13th- and 14th-century work. The west tower was rebuilt in 1825. At the east end of the south aisle is a large Decorated window which is thought to have been brought from the demolished Bruern Abbey in Oxfordshire. There is a fourteenth-century octagonal font and a two-storeyed fifteenth-century vestry. There are some damaged alabaster tomb effigies, and some monumental brasses are now displayed on wooden panels.

===Recording studio===
From 1972 to 1999, the former British Schools building in New Street was Chipping Norton Recording Studios. &quot;Baker Street&quot; by Gerry Rafferty, &quot;In The Army Now&quot; by Status Quo, &quot;Too Shy&quot; by Kajagoogoo, &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; by Jim Diamond, &quot;Perfect&quot; by Fairground Attraction, &quot;I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight&quot; by Cutting Crew and &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot; by the Bay City Rollers were recorded there. Jeff Beck, Barbara Dickson, Duran Duran, Marianne Faithfull, Alison Moyet, Nektar, Radiohead, The Supernaturals, Wet Wet Wet, XTC, Mark Owen and Chris Rea also used them.

===Castle===
Chipping Norton Castle was a timber Norman motte-and-bailey castle to the north-west of the town. Little of the original structures remains apart from earthworks. The remains have been a Scheduled Monument since 1949.

== Transport ==
Chipping Norton railway station served the town until 1962. The nearest stations now are at and . A community bus network called The Villager links residential roads and nearby villages with the town centre. Longer-distance buses run to Oxford and Banbury. Diamond and Stagecoach in Warwickshire operate service X50/50 to Stratford-upon-Avon. Pulham&#x27;s Coaches operate both the 801 to Cheltenham via Moreton-in-Marsh, Bourton-on-the-Water and Andoversford, and the X9 service to Witney via Chadlington, Charlbury and Finstock.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated north west of the town. BBC West Midlands and ITV Central can also be received from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM, Heart South on 102.6 FM and Witney Radio that broadcast from Witney on 107.4 FM.

The town is served by these local newspapers: &quot;The Oxford Times&quot; and the &quot;Banbury Guardian&quot;. There is also a longstanding community newspaper, &quot;The Chipping Norton News&quot;, which is staffed by a volunteer team and published monthly.

== Chipping Norton set ==
Several media, political and show-business acquaintances living near the town, including former British Prime Minister David Cameron, have been called the &quot;Chipping Norton set&quot;.
Members regularly met socially. It gained notoriety after the News International phone hacking scandal, which involved several members. Those affected, along with several attending social functions, were victims of phone hacking by the &quot;News of the World&quot;. Notable group meetings included the nearby wedding reception of Rebekah and Charlie Brooks, a 2010 Christmas dinner at the Brooks&#x27;s, and Elisabeth Murdoch and Matthew Freud&#x27;s 2011 Summer party at Burford Priory.

<text>In theoretical computer science, a discrete system is a system with a countable number of states. Discrete systems may be contrasted with continuous systems, which may also be called analog systems. A final discrete system is often modeled with a directed graph and is analyzed for correctness and complexity according to computational theory. Because discrete systems have a countable number of states, they may be described in precise mathematical models.

A computer is a finite-state machine that may be viewed as a discrete system. Because computers are often used to model not only other discrete systems but continuous systems as well, methods have been developed to represent real-world continuous systems as discrete systems. One such method involves sampling a continuous signal at discrete time intervals.

<doc id="564697" wikidata="Q3267946" url="?curid=564697" title="Floptical">
<text>Floptical refers to a type of floppy disk drive that combines magnetic and optical technologies to store data on media similar to standard -inch floppy disks. The name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;floppy&quot; and &quot;optical&quot;. It refers specifically to one brand of drive and disk system, but is also used more generically to refer to any system using similar techniques.

The original Floptical technology was announced in 1988 and introduced late in 1991 by Insite Peripherals, a venture funded company set up by Jim Adkisson, one of the key engineers behind the original -inch floppy disk drive development at Shugart Associates in 1976. The main shareholders were Maxell, Iomega and 3M. This original format normally held 21 MB of data, compared to the contemporary 3.5&quot; floppy capacity of 720 kB or 1.44 MB.

Over the next several years, similar products were introduced by other companies with ever increasing capacity, eventually reaching 240 MB in some systems. All of these, along with competing systems like the Zip drive, were replaced by writable CD-ROMs in many roles, and later, by thumb drives which were simpler, smaller, and faster.

== Technical aspects ==

The technology involves reading and writing data magnetically, while optically aligning the read/write head in the drive using grooves in the disk being sensed by an infrared LED and sensor (a form of visual servo). The magnetic head touches the recording surface, as it does in a normal floppy drive. The optical servo tracks allow for an increase in the tracking precision of the magnetic head, from the usual 135 tracks per inch to tracks per inch. Floptical disks provide 21 MB of storage. The drive has a second set of read/write heads so that it can read from and write to standard 720 KB and 1.44 MB ( KB) disks as well.

To allow for a high degree of compatibility with existing SCSI host adapters, Floptical drives were designed to work as a standard floppy disk drive, and not as a removable hard disk. To ensure this, a &quot;write lockout&quot; feature was added in the firmware, effectively inhibiting writing (including any kind of formatting) of the media. It is possible to unlock the drive by issuing a SCSI Mode Sense Command, and Insite also issued EPROMs where this feature was not present.

At least two models were produced, one with a manual lever that mechanically ejected the disc from the drive, and another with a small pinhole into which a paperclip can be inserted, in case the device rejected or ignored SCSI eject commands.

== Market performance ==
Insite licensed the floptical technology to a number of companies, including Matsushita, Iomega, Maxell/Hitachi and others. A number of these companies later formed the Floptical Technology Association, or FTA, to try to have the format adopted as a replacement of standard floppy disks.

Around 70,000 Insite Flopticals are believed to have been sold worldwide in the product&#x27;s lifetime. Silicon Graphics used them in their SGI Indigo and SGI Indy series of computer workstations. It was also reported that Commodore International had selected the Insite Floptical for its Amiga 3000. However, this did not take place, and while Flopticals were installed in many Amiga systems, they were sold by either Insite, TTR Development or Digital Micronics (DMI), and not bundled by Commodore.

Iomega licensed the Floptical technology as early as 1989 and produced a compatible drive known as the Insider.

A few years later, a number of other companies introduced Floptical-like but incompatible systems:

Iomega introduced their own ZIP-100 system storing 100 MB in 1994, which would go on to sell into the tens of millions. Later versions would increase the capacity to 250 and 750 MB. These had the disadvantage of not being able to read or write normal floppies, which generally required a second drive to be available.

Another similar system was Imation&#x27;s LS‑120 &quot;SuperDisk&quot; in 1996. The LS-120 stored 120 MB of data while retaining the ability to work with normal -inch disks, interfacing as a standard floppy for better compatibility. A later LS-240 version would store up to 240 MB.

A smaller competitor was the almost unknown Caleb UHD144 in 1997. Their primary advantage was the low cost of their disks.

Since 1998, Sony also tried their own Floptical-based format, the Sony HiFD, but quality control problems ruined its reputation. The first version could store 150 MB, but it was soon replaced by a 200 MB version.

There was serious consideration that one of these systems would succeed where the Floptical failed and replace the standard floppy disk outright, but the rapid introduction of writable CD-ROM systems in the early 2000s made the market disappear.

== Operating system support ==
Support of Floptical drives is present in all Microsoft Windows NT operating systems up to Windows 2000, where it figures as 20.8 MB drive format option in the FORMAT command options. The FORMAT command in Windows XP and newer lacks support of the Floptical drive. Floptical support exists in SCO OpenServer as well. SCSI-equipped Macintosh computers could boot from a Mac operating system installed on a Floptical; a formatting utility application was provided to erase and format Floptical disks. Likewise, Silicon Graphics&#x27;s IRIX operating system includes Floptical support.

<doc id="564699" wikidata="Q511841" url="?curid=564699" title="Giovanni Battista Morgagni">
<text>Giovanni Battista Morgagni (25 February 1682 – 6 December 1771) was an Italian anatomist, generally regarded as the father of modern anatomical pathology, who taught thousands of medical students from many countries during his 56 years as Professor of Anatomy at the University of Padua.

His most significant literary contribution, the monumental five-volume &quot;On the Seats and Causes of Disease&quot;, embodied a lifetime of experience in anatomical dissection and observation, and established the fundamental principle that most diseases are not vaguely dispersed throughout the body, but originate locally, in specific organs and tissues.

==Education==
His parents were in comfortable circumstances, but not of the nobility; it appears from his letters to Giovanni Maria Lancisi that Morgagni had ambitions to improve his rank. It may be inferred that he succeeded from the fact that he is described on a memorial tablet at Padua as &quot;nobilis forolensis&quot;, &quot;noble of Forlì&quot;, apparently by right of his wife. At the age of sixteen he went to Bologna to study philosophy and medicine, and graduated with much praise as a doctor in both faculties three years later, in 1701. He acted as prosector to Antonio Maria Valsalva (one of the distinguished pupils of Malpighi), who held the office of demonstrator anatomicus in the Bologna school, and whom he assisted more particularly in preparing his celebrated work on the &quot;Anatomy and Diseases of the Ear&quot;, published in 1704.

==Career==

===Early career===
Many years after, in 1740, Morgagni edited a collected edition of Valsalva&#x27;s writings, with important additions to the treatise on the ear, and with a memoir of the author. When Valsalva was transferred to Parma Morgagni succeeded to his anatomical demonstratorship. At this period he enjoyed a high repute in Bologna; he was made president of the Academia Enquietorum when in his twenty-second year, and he is said to have signalized his tenure of the presidential chair by discouraging abstract speculations, and by setting the fashion towards exact anatomical observation and reasoning.

He published the substance of his communications to the academy in 1706 under the title of &quot;Adversaria anatomica&quot;, the first of a series by which he became favorably known throughout Europe as an accurate anatomist; the book included &quot;Observations of the Larynx&quot;, the &quot;Lachrymal Apparatus&quot;, and the &quot;Pelvic Organs in the Female&quot;. After a time he gave up his post at Bologna, and occupied himself for the next two or three years at Padua, where he had a friend in Domenico Guglielmini (1655–1710), professor of medicine, but better-known as a writer on physics and mathematics, whose works he afterwards edited (1719) with a biography. Guglielmini desired to see him settled as a teacher at Padua, and the unexpected death of Guglielmini himself made the project feasible, Antonio Vallisneri (1661–1730) being transferred to the vacant chair, and Morgagni succeeding to the chair of theoretical medicine. He came to Padua in the spring of 1712, being then in his thirty-first year, and he taught medicine there with the most brilliant success until his death on 6 December 1771.

=== Middle career ===

When he had been three years in Padua, which at the time was part of the Republic of Venice, an opportunity occurred for his promotion (by the Venetian senate) to the chair of anatomy. In this prestigious position he became the successor of an illustrious line of scholars, including Vesalius, Gabriele Falloppio, Geronimo Fabrizio, Gasserius, and Adrianus Spigelius, and enjoyed a stipend that was increased from time to time by vote of the senate until it reached twelve hundred gold ducats. Shortly after coming to Padua he married a noble lady of Forlì, who bore him three sons and twelve daughters.

Morgagni enjoyed an unequaled popularity among all classes. He was of tall and dignified figure, with blonde hair and lilac eyes, and with a frank and happy expression; his manners were polished, and he was noted for the elegance of his Latin style. He lived in harmony with his colleagues, who are said not even to have envied him his unprecedentedly large stipend; his house and lecture-theatre were frequented &quot;tanquam officina sapientiae&quot; by students of all ages, attracted from all parts of Europe; he enjoyed the friendship and favor of distinguished Venetian senators and of cardinals; and successive popes conferred honours upon him.

Before he had been long in Padua the students of the German nation, of all the faculties there, elected him their patron, and he advised and assisted them in the purchase of a house to be a German library and club, for all time. He was elected into the imperial Caesareo-Leopoldina Academy in 1708 (originally located at Schweinfurth), and to a higher grade in 1732, into the Royal Society in 1724, into the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1731, the St. Petersburg Academy in 1735, and the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1754. Among his more celebrated pupils were Antonio Scarpa (who died in 1832, connecting the school of Morgagni with the modern era), Domenico Cotugno (1736–1822), and Leopoldo Marco Antonio Caldani (1725–1813), the author of the magnificent atlas of anatomical plates published in 2 volumes at Venice in 1801–1814.

In his earlier years at Padua, Morgagni brought out five more series of the &quot;Adversaria anatomica&quot; (1717–1719); these his strictly medical publications were few and casual (on gallstones, varices of the Venae cavae, cases of stone, and several memoranda on medico-legal points, drawn up at the request of the curia). Classical scholarship in those years occupied his pen more than anatomical observation.

===Late career===

It was not until 1761, when he was in his eightieth year, that he brought out the great work which, once for all, made pathological anatomy a science, and diverted the course of medicine into new channels of exactness or precision—the &quot;De Sedibus et causis morborum per anatomen indagatis&quot; &quot;Of the seats and causes of diseases investigated through anatomy&quot;, in five books printed as two folio volumes, which during the succeeding ten years, notwithstanding its bulk, was reprinted several times (thrice in four years) in its original Latin, and was translated into French (1765, republished 1820), English (1769), and German languages (1771). In 1769, he gave possibly the first description of what was later named Crohn&#x27;s disease.

The only special treatise on pathological anatomy previous to that of Morgagni was the work of Théophile Bonet of Neuchâtel, &quot;Sepulchretum: sive anatomia practica ex cadaveribus morbo denatis&quot;, &quot;The Cemetery, or, anatomy practiced from corpses dead of disease&quot;, first published (Geneva, 2 vols. folio) in 1679, three years before Morgagni was born; it was republished at Geneva (3 vols., folio) in 1700, and again at Leiden in 1709. Although the normal anatomy of the body had been comprehensively, and in some parts exhaustively, written by Vesalius and Fallopius, it had not occurred to any one to examine and describe systematically the anatomy of diseased organs and parts. Harvey, a century after Vesalius, poignantly remarks that there is more to be learned from the dissection of one person who had died of tuberculosis or other chronic malady than from the bodies of ten persons who had been hanged.

Francis Glisson indeed (1597–1677) shows in a passage quoted by Bonet in the preface to the &quot;Sepulchretum&quot;, that he was familiar with the idea, at least, of systematically comparing the state of the organs in a series of bodies, and of noting those conditions which invariably accompanied a given set of symptoms. The work of Bonet was, however, the first attempt at a system of morbid anatomy, and, although it dwelt mostly upon curiosities and monstrosities, it enjoyed much repute in its day; Haller speaks of it as an immortal work, which may in itself serve for a pathological library.

Morgagni, in the preface to his own work, discusses the defects and merits of the &quot;Sepulchretum&quot;: it was largely a compilation of other men&#x27;s cases, well and ill authenticated; it was prolix, often inaccurate and misleading from ignorance of the normal anatomy, and it was wanting in what would now be called objective impartiality, a quality which was introduced as decisively into morbid anatomy by Morgagni as it had been introduced two centuries earlier into normal human anatomy by Vesalius.

Morgagni has narrated the circumstances under which the &quot;De Sedibus&quot; took origin. Having finished his edition of Valsalva in 1740, he was taking a holiday in the country, spending much of his time in the company, of a young friend who was curious in many branches of knowledge. The conversation turned upon the &quot;Sepulchretum&quot; of Bonet, and it was suggested to Morgagni by his dilettante friend that he should put on record his own observations. It was agreed that letters on the anatomy of diseased, organs and parts should be written for the perusal of this favoured youth (whose name is not mentioned); and they were continued from time to time until they numbered seventy. Those seventy letters constitute the &quot;De sedibus et causis morborum&quot;, which was given to the world as a systematic treatise in 2 vols., folio (Venice, 1761), twenty years after the task of epistolary instruction was begun.

The letters are arranged in five books, treating of the morbid conditions of the body &quot;a capite ad calcem&quot;, and together containing the records of some 646 dissections. Some of these are given at great length, and with a precision of statement and exhaustiveness of detail hardly surpassed in the so-called protocols of the German pathological institutes of the present time; others, again, are fragments brought in to elucidate some question that had arisen. The symptoms during the course of the malady and other antecedent circumstances are always prefixed with more or less fullness, and discussed from the point of view of the conditions found after death. Subjects in all ranks of life, including several cardinals, figure in this remarkable gallery of the dead. Many of the cases are taken from Morgagni&#x27;s early experiences at Bologna, and from the records of his teachers Valsalva and I.F. Albertini (1662–1738) not elsewhere published. They are selected and arranged with method and purpose, and they are often (and somewhat casually) made the occasion of a long excursus on general pathology and medicine.

== Legacy ==

During his career as a physician he was careful to take extensive notes on many of his consultations. These writings allow the modern reader to observe his practice and description of the body through his own words. We are further able to examine the progress of Morgagni&#x27;s study of anatomy as it related to his treatment of patients. We are further able to view a particular perspective of a single physician in the context of the 18th century when he lived in order better understand medical practice during this time period.

The range of Morgagni&#x27;s scholarship, as evidenced by his references to early and contemporary literature, was very broad. It has been contended that he was himself not free from prolixity, the besetting sin of the learned; and certainly the form and arrangement of his treatise are such as to make it difficult to use by subsequent practitioners, notwithstanding that it is well indexed in the original edition, in that of Tissot (3 vols., 4to, Yverdon, 1779), and in more recent editions. It differs from modern treatises insofar as the symptoms determine the order and manner of presenting the anatomical facts.

His 1769 work described the post mortem findings of air in cerebral circulation and surmised this was the cause of death. Although Morgagni&#x27;s cases resulted from gas embolism due to damage to the bowel, the same pathology is seen in decompression illness.
Although Morgagni was the first to understand and to demonstrate the absolute necessity of basing diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment on an exact and comprehensive knowledge of anatomical conditions, he made no attempt (like that of the Vienna school sixty years later) to exalt pathological anatomy into a science disconnected from clinical medicine and remote from practical experience with the scalpel. His precision, his exhaustiveness, and his freedom from bias are his essentially modern or scientific qualities; his scholarship and high consideration for classical and foreign work, his sense of practical ends (or his common sense), and the breadth of his intellectual horizon prove him to have lived before medical science had become largely technical or mechanical.

His treatise was the commencement of the era of steady, or cumulative progress in pathology and in practical medicine. From that time on, symptoms ceased to be made up into more or less conventional groups, each of which was a disease; on the other hand, they began to be viewed as the cry of the suffering organs, and it became possible to develop Thomas Sydenham&#x27;s grand conception of a natural history of disease in a catholic or scientific spirit.

A biography of Morgagni by Mosca was published at Naples in 1768. His life may also be read in Angelo Fabroni&#x27;s &quot;Vitae illustr. Italor.&quot;, and a convenient abridgment of Fabroni&#x27;s memoir will be found prefixed to Tissot&#x27;s edition of the &quot;De sedibus&quot;, etc. A collected edition of his works was published at Venice in 5 volumes, in 1765.

<text>In stock market technical analysis, support and resistance are certain predetermined levels of the price of a security at which it is thought that the price will tend to stop and reverse. These levels are denoted by multiple touches of price without a breakthrough of the level.

== Support versus resistance ==

A support level is a level where the price tends to find support as it falls due to an increase in demand for the asset. This means that the price is more likely to &quot;bounce&quot; off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue falling until meeting another support level.

A resistance level is the opposite of a support level. It is where the price tends to find resistance as it rises due to an increase in selling interest. Again, this means that the price is more likely to &quot;bounce&quot; off this level rather than break through it. However, once the price has breached this level, by an amount exceeding some noise, it is likely to continue rising until meeting another resistance level.

Traders use support and resistance levels in different chart patterns.

== Reactive versus proactive support and resistance ==

Proactive support and resistance methods are &quot;predictive&quot; in that they often outline areas where price has not actually been. They are based upon current price action that, through analysis, has been shown to be predictive of future price action. Proactive support and resistance methods include Measured Moves, Swing Ratio Projection/Confluence (Static (Square of Nine), Dynamic (Fibonacci)), Calculated Pivots, Volatility Based, Trendlines and Moving averages, VWAP, Market Profile (VAH, VAL and POC).

Reactive support and resistance are the opposite: they are formed directly as a result of price action or volume behaviour. They include Volume Profile, Price Swing lows/highs, Initial Balance, Open Gaps, certain Candle Patterns (e.g. Engulfing, Tweezers) and OHLC.

A price histogram is useful in showing at what price a market has spent more relative time. Psychological levels near round numbers often serve as support and resistance.

== Identifying support and resistance levels ==

Support and resistance levels can be identified by trend lines (technical analysis). Some traders believe in using pivot point calculations.

The more often a support/resistance level is &quot;tested&quot; (touched and bounced off by price), the more significance is given to that specific level.

If a price breaks past a support level, that support level often becomes a new resistance level. The opposite is true as well; if price breaks a resistance level, it will often find support at that level in the future.

Psychological Support and Resistance levels form an important part of a trader&#x27;s technical analysis. As price reaches a value ending in 50 (ex. 1.2050) or 00 (ex. 1.3000), people often see these levels as a strong potential for interruption in the current movement. The price may hit the line and reverse, it could hover around the level as Bulls and Bears fought for supremacy, or it may punch straight through. A trader should always exercise caution when approaching 00 levels in general, and 50 levels if it has previously acted as Support or Resistance.

<doc id="564703" wikidata="Q663599" url="?curid=564703" title="Faringdon">
<text>Faringdon is a historic market town in the Vale of White Horse, Oxfordshire, England, south-west of Oxford, north-west of Wantage and east-north-east of Swindon. Its views extend to the River Thames in the north and the highest ground visible is on the Ridgeway in the south. Faringdon was Berkshire&#x27;s westernmost town until the 1974 boundary changes transferred its administration to Oxfordshire. The civil parish is formally known as &quot;Great Faringdon&quot;, to distinguish it from Little Faringdon in West Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census gave a population of 7,121; it was estimated at 7,992 in 2019. On 1 February 2004, Faringdon became the first place in south-east England to be awarded Fairtrade Town status.

==History==
The toponym &quot;Faringdon&quot; means &quot;hill covered in fern&quot;. Claims, for example by P. J. Goodrich, that King Edward the Elder (reigned 899–924) died in Faringdon are unfounded. The Domesday Book of 1086 records &quot;Farendone&quot; as large settlement with 45 households (in the top 20% of all settlements in England for population) in the ancient hundred of Wyfold in Berkshire. Faringdon was one of many settlements owned by the king, so had the benefit of paying no geld, a land tax.

After the Conquest a castle was erected in Faringdon by the Earl of Gloucester, which was afterwards razed by Stephen, who built upon its site a priory for Cistercian monks, subject to Beaulieu Abbey, in Hampshire. Faringdon developed into a borough and was apparently already separate from the hundred of Wyfold when granted by King John to Beaulieu Abbey. King John established an abbey in Faringdon in 1202 (probably on the site of Portwell House), but its monks removed to Beaulieu Abbey in 1203. The Faringdon land grant became an outlying grange, one of a network of farms, worked to provide food for the monks and also to help support the abbey&#x27;s economy. The hundred of Faringdon, as held by the abbot of Beaulieu, included the parishes of Great and Little Faringdon and Coxwell.

The town was granted a weekly market in 1218, and as a result came to be called Chipping Faringdon. A weekly outdoor market is still held on Tuesdays.

In 1417 the aged Archbishop of Dublin, Thomas Cranley, died in Faringdon while journeying to London.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the early sixteenth century, the abbey lands in Faringdon were sold to wealthy nobles.

In 1838, Faringdon (also written as Farringdon Great), and Faringdon Little located six miles distant, and other parishes were mainly within Faringdon hundred, Berkshire. In the late 19th century as technology increased the ability to provide higher general standard of living, new specialized units were formed to provide additional functions such as poor law unions rather than parish-level charity, and rural sewer districts to provide sub-county level health improvements, leading to the formation of the Faringdon Rural District. So the hundred faded from use, especially as county- and city-level courts of justice were instituted.

Due to major populations increases in boroughs and cities, the increase in transportation between regions, and longstanding ties between communities, the centuries-old county boundaries had in many areas become a hindrance to &quot;getting things done&quot;, both in the administration of government functions and in some areas in daily business and personal activities. So in the 20th century a major restructuring across England and Wales meant that the local impact would cause Faringdon and nearby parishes (i.e. all the parishes of the hundred of Faringdon) to be transferred from Berkshire to Oxfordshire when the border was redrawn on 1 April 1974 due to the Local Government Act 1972.

==Places of interest==
===All Saints&#x27; Church===

The Church of England parish church of All Saints may date from the 12th century, and the clerestory and possibly the west end of the nave survive from this period. A Norman doorway survives, although not in its original position, in the baptistery. The chancel and north transept are 13th century and the west chapel is 14th century. The north chapel is a late medieval Perpendicular Gothic addition with 15th-century windows.

All Saints has a central bell tower, which was reduced in height in 1645 after it was damaged by a cannonball in the English Civil War. Faringdon was fought over because it commanded the road to the Radcot Bridge over the River Thames. The tower now has a ring of eight bells. The three oldest bells were cast in 1708. James Wells of Aldbourne, Wiltshire, cast the tenor bell in 1779 and another bell in 1803. The three youngest bells, including the treble, were cast in 1874 by Mears and Stainbank.

===Local legend===
The churchyard is said to be haunted by the headless ghost of a naval officer, Hampden Pye. Local legend has it that Pye was decapitated in a battlefield explosion while fighting in the War of the Spanish Succession, after being convinced to join up by his mother, who sought to separate him from a local girl she considered an unsuitable match. An alternative legend states that Pye was an unfaithful husband who was decapitated by his wife with a gun. The ghost was reportedly exorcised shortly after Pye&#x27;s death.

===Old Town Hall===
The Old Town Hall (once the Market Hall) in the Market Place dates from the 17th century. It is a Grade II* listed building. The Corn Exchange, which was designed in the Gothic Revival style, is more recent and dates from 1863.

=== Faringdon Folly ===

Just east of the town is Folly Hill or Faringdon Hill, a Greensand outcrop. In common with Badbury Hill to the west of the town, it has an ancient ditched defensive ring (hill fort). This was fortified by supporters of Matilda sometime during the Anarchy of 1135–1141, when she claimed the throne from King Stephen, but was soon defeated by him. Oliver Cromwell fortified it in an unsuccessful campaign to defeat the Royalist garrison at Faringdon House. The Pye family had Scots pines planted around the summit, around the time that Faringdon House was rebuilt in the late 18th century. The building is a conspicuous landmark from the Vale of White Horse, White Horse Hill, the Berkshire Downs near Lockinge, and the Cotswolds to the north-west.

The folly on Folly Hill was designed by Lord Gerald Wellesley, later 7th Duke of Wellington, for Lord Berners, and built in 1935. It is high and affords panoramic views of the Vale of White Horse. It once bore a sign saying &quot;Members of the public committing suicide from this tower do so at their own risk.&quot; During the Second World War the Home Guard used it as an observation post. The scholar John Garth has suggested that the folly was inspiration for Saruman&#x27;s tower, Orthanc, in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and that Berners&#x27;s painting of the Folly atop its hill led Tolkien to make a similar painting of a view in the Shire, &quot;The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water&quot;. In 1982 Robert Heber-Percy restored it and gave it to the town in trust. It has been a Grade II listed building since 1986. Near the top of London Street near Faringdon Folly is a pub bearing that name.

===Faringdon House===
There is a manor house and estate, close to the edge of Faringdon, called Faringdon House. The original house was damaged during the civil war. Its owner at the time, Sir Robert Pye, who was a Royalist, was put under siege by his own son Robert who was a Parliamentarian colonel. Building of the current, smaller, house began about 1780 and was not completed until after 1785. The house was bought in 1787 by William Hallett Esq. It was the home of Lord Berners in the mid-20th century. For a time it was owned by the writer Sofka Zinovieff, the granddaughter of Berners&#x27; companion, Robert Heber-Percy, who inherited it on Berners&#x27; death in 1950.

==Geology==

Faringdon is the site of the Faringdon Sponge Gravel Member, part of the Cretaceous Lower Greensand Group. It is rich in fossil sponges, other invertebrates, a few vertebrate bones and teeth, and good examples of bioerosion.

==Transport==
===Roads===
The £1.6-million A420 Faringdon Bypass was opened in July 1979.

===Buses===
Stagecoach West run the S6 service up to every 15 minutes between Swindon, Shrivenham, Watchfield, Faringdon, Buckland, Southmoor, Besselsleigh, Botley and Oxford. Pulham&#x27;s Coaches run both the 67 service up to every hour between Faringdon, Stanford in the Vale, East Challow and Wantage, and the 68 service 2-4 times a day between Faringdon, Uffington, Childrey, East Challow and Wantage.

===Railway===
A Faringdon branch line was opened in 1864 between Faringdon and the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Uffington, with construction funded by the Faringdon Railway Company (bought outright by the GWR in 1886). Passenger traffic peaked in 1913, but later declined to an extent that the passenger service was withdrawn in 1951. Goods traffic continued until the Beeching closures of 1964. The Faringdon railway station building remains. It currently houses a nursery school.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM, Heart South on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio on 106.4, and Witney Radio which broadcasts to the town on 107.1 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspapers the Herald Series and the &quot;Oxfordshire Guardian&quot;.

==Cultural pursuits==
Faringdon is notable for the dyed pigeons at Faringdon House. The custom of dyeing pigeons was started by the eccentric Lord Berners. Around the town can be seen stone plaques with comments such as &quot;Please do not throw stones at this notice&quot;, reflecting the ongoing influence of Berners. Since 2004, Faringdon has held an annual weekend festival known originally as the &quot;Faringdon Arts Festival&quot;, now as &quot;FollyFest&quot;. It is generally held as a non-profit event on the last summer weekend of the school year.

<doc id="564706" wikidata="Q6860304" url="?curid=564706" title="Milo Bloom">
<text>Milo Bloom is a fictional character in the American comic strip &quot;Bloom County&quot;. He was originally the main character, but was soon overshadowed by his best friend Michael Binkley and later on by Opus the penguin.

==In &quot;Bloom County&quot;==

Milo is the most worldly and cynical of all the characters; he is seemingly the only county resident who cares about politics and goings-on in the world outside his small town. He lives in the Bloom County Boarding House with his grandparents, Major Bloom and Bess Bloom. Said grandparents run the boarding house where most of the characters live. To amuse himself when alone, Milo likes to do things like going spear fishing at a small creek with a whale harpoon.

Milo is also a reporter for the &quot;Bloom Beacon&quot; and later the &quot;Bloom Picayune&quot;, where he engages in controversial reporting (he says he graduated from the &quot;Rupert Murdoch School of Exuberant Journalism&quot;). In early strips, he regularly bothers Senator Bedfellow with ridiculous questions, asking for confirming accusations (usually about the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa), and attempting to convict him for virtually anything, although Bedfellow is not his only target. A noteworthy scandal he creates (with some help from Oliver Wendell Jones) involved changing the front page article of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, from &quot;Reagan Calls Women &#x27;America&#x27;s Most Valuable Resource&#x27;&quot; to &quot;Reagan Calls Women &#x27;America&#x27;s Little Dumplins&#x27;&quot;, resulting in an attack on the White House by angry feminists but earning praise from Phyllis Schlafly. He has also changed the headline of the Russian newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;, intending for it to say &quot;Gorbachev urges disarmament: Total! Unilateral!&quot;. Unfortunately, Oliver gets the translation wrong, resulting in the headline being &quot;Gorbachev sings tractors: Turnip! Buttocks!&quot;

Milo appears to be the only staff reporter on the &quot;Bloom Beacon&quot;. The only other employees seen are the editor-in-chief and Opus, who serves, at various times, as personals editor, editorial writer, ombudsman, and cartoonist (or, as he styles it, &quot;stripper&quot;).

He also helps create and manage Bill the Cat&#x27;s band, Deathtöngue, and cofounds with Binkley a political party, The Meadow Party, with Bill and Opus on their presidential ticket.

==Post-&quot;Bloom County&quot;==
Milo didn&#x27;t have an active role in either of Breathed&#x27;s later syndicated strips. He appeared in &quot;Outland&quot; only as a background extra on a bus headed far away a week before the feature ended. He appeared in only two frames of the weekly strip &quot;Opus&quot;, both in the form of visions. The first of these, early on in the strip, was as part of Opus&#x27; vision of former &quot;Bloom County&quot; residents he wished to find - Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Steve Dallas, and Bill the Cat. The latter four would all reunite with Opus during the course of the strip, but not Milo. His other appearance was just prior to the strip&#x27;s conclusion, as part of Steve Dallas&#x27; vision of former &quot;Bloom County&quot; residents (Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, Portnoy, and Bill the Cat) waving goodbye as they rode off into the distance atop Cutter John&#x27;s wheelchair.

==Bloom County Revival==
Milo returned in the first strip of the 2015 revival of &quot;Bloom County&quot;, informing Opus that he had been &quot;asleep&quot; for twenty-five years. He continues to play an active role in the comics, though his appearances are relatively minor compared to those of Opus and Bill the Cat. Milo&#x27;s Uncle Dewey and his niece Baby Boo have appeared in the strip as well.
