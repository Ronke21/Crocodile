<text>The House of Wettin () was a dynasty which included Saxon kings, prince-electors, dukes, and counts, who once ruled territories in the present-day German federated states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. The dynasty is one of the oldest in Europe, and its origins can be traced back to the town of Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt. The Wettins gradually rose to power within the Holy Roman Empire. Members of the family became the rulers of several medieval states, starting with the Saxon Eastern March in 1030. Other states they gained were Meissen in 1089, Thuringia in 1263, and Saxony in 1423. These areas cover large parts of Central Germany as a cultural area of Germany.

The family divided into two ruling branches in 1485 by the Treaty of Leipzig: the Ernestine and Albertine branches. The older Ernestine branch played a key role during the Protestant Reformation. Many ruling monarchs outside Germany were later tied to its cadet branch, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The Albertine branch, while less prominent, ruled most of Saxony and played a part in Polish history.

Agnates of the House of Wettin have, at various times, ascended the thrones of the United Kingdom, Portugal, Bulgaria, Poland-Lithuania, Electorate of Saxony (later the Kingdom of Saxony), Mexico and Belgium. Only the Belgian line retains their throne today.

== Origins: Wettin of Saxony ==

The oldest member of the House of Wettin who is known for certain is Theodoric I of Wettin, also known as &quot;Dietrich&quot;, &quot;Thiedericus&quot;, and &quot;Thierry I of Liesgau&quot; (died c. 982). He was most probably based in the Liesgau (located at the western edge of the Harz). Around 1000, the family acquired Wettin Castle, which was originally built by the local Slavic tribes (see Sorbs), after which they named themselves. Wettin Castle is located in Wettin in the Hassegau (or Hosgau) on the Saale River. Around 1030, the Wettin family received the Eastern March as a fief.

The prominence of the Wettins in the Slavic Saxon Eastern March (or &quot;Ostmark&quot;) caused Emperor Henry IV to invest them with the March of Meissen as a fief in 1089. The family advanced over the course of the Middle Ages: in 1263, they inherited the landgraviate of Thuringia (although without Hesse) and in 1423, they were invested with the Duchy of Saxony, centred at Wittenberg, thus becoming one of the prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire.

== Ernestine and Albertine Wettins ==

The family split into two ruling branches in 1485 when the sons of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony divided the territories hitherto ruled jointly. The elder son Ernest, who had succeeded his father as Prince-elector, received the territories assigned to the Elector (&quot;Electorate of Saxony&quot;) and Thuringia, while his younger brother Albert obtained the March of Meissen, which he ruled from Dresden. As Albert ruled under the title of &quot;Duke of Saxony&quot;, his possessions were also known as Ducal Saxony.

===Ernestines===
The older Ernestine branch remained predominant until 1547 and played an important role in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation. Frederick III (&quot;Friedrich der Weise&quot;) appointed Martin Luther (1512) and Philipp Melanchthon (1518) to the University of Wittenberg, which he had established in 1502.

The Ernestine predominance ended in the Schmalkaldic War (1546/7), which pitted the Protestant Schmalkaldic League against the Emperor Charles V. Although itself Lutheran, the Albertine branch rallied to the Emperor&#x27;s cause. Charles V had promised Moritz the rights to the electorship. After the Battle of Mühlberg, Johann Friedrich der Großmütige, had to cede territory (including Wittenberg) and the electorship to his cousin Moritz. Although imprisoned, Johann Friedrich was able to plan a new university. It was established by his three sons on 19 March 1548 as the &quot;Höhere Landesschule&quot; at Jena. On 15 August 1557, Emperor Ferdinand I awarded it the status of university.

The Ernestine line was thereafter restricted to Thuringia and its dynastic unity swiftly crumbled, dividing into a number of smaller states, the Ernestine duchies. Nevertheless, with Ernst der Fromme, Duke of Saxe-Gotha (1601–1675), the house gave rise to an important early-modern ruler who was ahead of his time in supporting the education of his people and in improving administration. In the 18th century, Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, established what was to become known as Weimar Classicism at his court in Weimar, notably by bringing Johann Wolfgang von Goethe there.

It was only in the 19th century that one of the many Ernestine branches, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, regained importance through marriages as the &quot;stud of Europe&quot;, by ascending the thrones of Belgium (in 1831), Portugal (1853–1910), Bulgaria (1908–1946) and the United Kingdom (1901-present, though the relevant marriage had taken place in 1840) and also providing a consort to the future Habsburg Emperor of Mexico (1857).

====Residences of Ernestine branches====
===Albertines===
The junior Albertine branch maintained most of the territorial integrity of Saxony, preserving it as a significant power in the region, and used small appanage fiefs for its cadet branches, few of which survived for significant lengths of time. The Ernestine Wettins, on the other hand, repeatedly subdivided their territory, creating an intricate patchwork of small duchies and counties in Thuringia.

The Albertine Wettins ruled as Electors (1547–1806) and Kings of Saxony (1806–1918), and also played a role in Polish history – two Wettins were Kings of Poland (between 1697–1763) and a third ruled the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–1814) as a satellite of Napoleon I. After the Napoleonic Wars, the Albertine branch lost about 40% of its lands (the economically less-developed northern parts of the old Electorate of Saxony) to Prussia, restricting it to a territory coextensive with the modern Saxony (see Final Act of the Congress of Vienna 18 May 1815). Frederick Augustus III lost his throne in the German Revolution of 1918.

The role of current head of the Albertine &quot;House of Saxony&quot; is claimed by his great-grandson Prince Rüdiger of Saxony, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen (born 23 December 1953). However, the headship of Prince Rüdiger is contested by his second cousin, Alexander (born 1954), son of Roberto Afif (later by change of name Mr Gessaphe) and Princess Maria Anna of Saxony, a sister of the childless former head of the Albertines, Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen (died 2012), who had adopted his nephew and granted him the name Prince of Saxony, contrary to the rules of male descent under the Salic Law. Both are however not recognized by the Nobility Archive in Marburg, nor by the Conference of the Formerly Ruling Houses in Germany – Prince Rüdiger because his father Timo was expelled from the House of Wettin, and Prince Alexander because he is not of agnatic noble descent (his father was Roberto Afif from Lebanon). Consequently, the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin is officially treated by the German nobility as extinct in its legal succession-line.

====Albertine Electors and Kings of Saxony====

====Residences of the Albertine branch====
== The House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ==
The senior (Ernestine) branch of the House of Wettin lost the electorship to the Albertine line in 1547, but retained its holdings in Thuringia, dividing the area into a number of smaller states. One of the resulting Ernestine houses, known as Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until 1826 and as Saxe-Coburg and Gotha after that, went on to contribute kings of Belgium (from 1831) and Bulgaria (1908–1946), as well as furnishing consorts to queens regnant of Portugal (Prince Ferdinand) and the United Kingdom (Prince Albert), and the Emperor of Mexico (Carlota of Mexico) Thus, the British and Portuguese thrones became possessions of persons who belonged to the House of Wettin for a time.

From King George I to Queen Victoria, the British Royal family was called the House of Hanover, being a junior branch of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg and thus part of the dynasty of the Guelphs. In the late 19th century, Queen Victoria charged the College of Arms in England to determine the correct personal surname of her late husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha—and, thus, the proper surname of the royal family upon the accession of her son. After extensive research, they concluded that it was Wettin, but this name was never used, either by the Queen or by her son (King Edward VII) or by her grandson (King George V); they were simply Kings of the House of &quot;Saxe-Coburg-Gotha&quot;.

Severe anti-German sentiment during World War I (1914-1918) led some influential members of the British public (especially radical Republicans such as H. G. Wells) to question the loyalty of the royal family. Advisors to King George V searched for an acceptable surname for the British royal family, but &quot;Wettin&quot; was rejected as &quot;unsuitably comic&quot;. An Order in Council legally changed the name of the British royal family to &quot;Windsor&quot; (originally suggested by Lord Stamfordham) in 1917.

=== Residences of the family ===
==Branches and titles of the House of Wettin and its agnatic descent==

===Early Wettins===
* Counts of Wettin
* Margraves of Landsberg
* Margraves of Meissen
* Margraves of Lusatia
* Dukes of Saxony, Landgraves of Thuringia
* Electors of Saxony and Arch-Marshals of the Holy Roman Empire
===Ernestines===
* Electors of Saxony and Arch-Marshals of the Holy Roman Empire (1464–1547)
====Existing Ernestine branches====

Branch of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach
* Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, extant lines all shared last common ancestor in the person of William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. However there are only two members of this line left, Michael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Prince Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. Both were born in 1946. Since Prince Michael has no sons, and Prince Wilhelm Ernst; whose only son Prince Georg-Constantin (13 April 1977 – 9 June 2018), a banker who was married but without issue, was killed in a horse riding accident on 9 June 2018 while riding with Jean Christophe Iseux von Pfetten. Therefore, the Grand Ducal House of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach will most likely become extinct in the male line. These two represent the last non-morganatic descendants of William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar
** Illegitimate line of Barons of Heygendorff, four males left

Branch of Saxe-Meiningen
* Saxe-Meiningen lines all shared common descent from Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen
** Morganatic lines from Ernst, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen
** Morganatic line from Bernhard, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen
** Legitimate line from Bernhard, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen of whom only Prince Frederick Konrad of Saxe-Meiningen (Born on 14 April 1952) is still alive today.

In the very likely event of the extinction of these two senior branches, the sole represantation of the Ernestine Wettins will pass to the descendants of Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, who are the present Saxe-Coburg-Gothas led by Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (b. 21 March 1943), the House of Windsor, the Royal Family of Belgium and the Royal Family of Bulgaria. Francis and his nephew Ludwig Frederick Emil von Coburg are also ancestors to morganatic lines.
* Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, last common descent from Francis Josias, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, further divided into:
** Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, last common descent from Francis, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, further divided into:
*** House of Windsor, last common descent from Albert, Prince Consort of the United Kingdom, as in 1863 Edward VII and his son, the future George V renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the succession fell into the line of the Duke of Albany.
**** Gloucester line Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester
**** Kentian Line, from Prince George, Duke of Kent
*** Mainline (Albany) Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, from Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who until 1919 was the Duke of Albany

*** House of Belgium, all living members share common descent from Albert II of Belgium. However as absolute primogeniture is in effect in Belgium, if and on the ascencion of Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant to the throne, the ruling house of Belgium will no longer considered agnates to the House of Wettin
****Eppinghoven, illegitimate agnatic branch to the House of Belgium from Leopold I of Belgium and Arcadie Claret

<doc id="578491" wikidata="Q2341962" url="?curid=578491" title="Glossary of rail transport terms">
<text>Rail transport terms are a form of technical terminology applied to railways. Although many terms are uniform across different nations and companies, they are by no means universal, with differences often originating from parallel development of rail transport systems in different parts of the world, and in the national origins of the engineers and managers who built the inaugural rail infrastructure. An example is the term &quot;railroad&quot;, used (but not exclusively) in North America, and &quot;railway&quot;, generally used in English-speaking countries outside North America and by the International Union of Railways. In English-speaking countries outside the United Kingdom, a mixture of US and UK terms may exist.

Various terms, both global and specific to individual countries, are listed here. The abbreviation &quot;UIC&quot; refers to terminology adopted by the International Union of Railways in its official publications and thesaurus.

; Harmonic rock or harmonic rock and roll
: The condition of locomotives and cars swaying in opposite directions when traversing depressions on the roadbed. A potentially dangerous condition that can cause coupler damage, lading damage, or derailments at slower speeds.
; Head-End Power
: A scheme whereby the locomotive engine or a separate generator provides hotel power to carriages
; Headboard
: A sign attached to a locomotive to identify a named train or charter, or for other special occasions
; Headstock
: A transverse structural member located at the extreme end of a rail vehicle&#x27;s underframe. The headstock supports the coupling at that end of the vehicle, and may also support buffers, in which case it may also be known as a &quot;buffer beam&quot;.
; Heavy haul
: Heavy freight operations
; High rail
: The upper rail in a curve or superelevation, which typically experiences higher lateral loads and greater wear
; Hole
: A passing siding. Inferior trains &quot;lay over in the hole&quot; to let superior ones pass.
; Home signal
: See absolute signal.
; Horn blocks
: Plates lining the axlebox cut-outs in a locomotive frame to allow smooth vertical movement under control of the springs
; Hostling
: The action of shuttling a locomotive from the yard to the engine house or vice versa
; Hotbox
: An axle bearing that has become excessively hot due to friction
; Hotbox detector
: A device attached to the track that monitors passing trains for hot axles, and reports results via radio transmission (typical in the US) or a circuit to the signal box (typical in the UK). See &quot;defect detector&quot;.
; Hudson type
: A steam locomotive with a 4-6-4 wheel arrangement
; Hump
: A raised section in a rail sorting yard that allows operators to use gravity to move freight railcars into the proper position within the yard when making up trains of cars. This is faster and requires less effort than moving cars with a switching engine.
; Hunting
: Swaying motion of a railway vehicle or bogie caused by the coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. The truck or bogie wanders from side to side between the rails, &quot;hunting&quot; for the optimum location based on the forces at play.

== I ==
; Independent brake or locomotive brake
: The braking system that applies or releases the brakes of a locomotive independently from its train
; Infill station or in-fill station
: A train station built on an existing passenger line to address demand in a location between existing stations
; Injector
: A device to force water into a steam locomotive&#x27;s boiler by steam pressure
; Insulated rail joint (IRJ) or insulated block joint (IBJ)
: Rail joints incorporating insulation to isolate individual track circuits
; Interchange
: Any track or yard where rail cars are transferred from one carrier to another
; Interlocking
: An arrangement of switches and signals interconnected in a way that each movement follows the other in a proper and safe sequence
; Intermodal freight transport
: Moving goods by more than one type of vehicle, often achieved using shipping containers that are transferred among railroad &quot;flatcars&quot;, ships, airplanes, and tractor-trailer trucks
; Intermodal passenger transport
: Moving people by more than one type of vehicle
; Interoperability
: Ability of a transport network to operate trains and infrastructures to provide, accept and use services so exchanged without any substantial change in functionality or performance
; Island platform
: A railway platform that has tracks along the full lengths of both sides

== J ==

; Jacobs Bogie
: A Bogie, or truck (American), shared between two pieces of rolling stock. Cars joined with Jacobs bogies are semi-permanently joined in an articulated configuration. A weight-saving feature used on lightweight passenger trains.
; Joint bar or rail joiner
: A metal plate that joins the ends of rails in jointed track
; Jointed track
: Track in which the rails are laid in lengths of around 20 m and bolted to each other end-to-end by means of fishplates or joint bars
; Journal bearing
: A bearing without rolling elements; a plain bearing
; Journal box
: The housing of a journal bearing. See also Axlebox above.
; Jubilee type
: A steam locomotive with a 4-4-4 wheel arrangement
; Junction
: A point at which two lines or separate routes diverge from each other

== K ==
; Keeper
: A padlock or hook securing the lever of a hand-operated switch, thereby preventing the switch points from moving as rolling stock passes over them
; Kick
: To shove a car a short distance and uncouple it in motion, allowing it to roll free under gravity and/or its own inertia onto a track. Commonly practiced in bowl or hump yards to make up or break down trains or classify large numbers of cars in an expedient fashion. Differs from a flying switch in that the locomotive is pushing the car rather than pulling it when the cut is made.
; Kicker
: A freight car with a defect in its brake valve that causes the entire train&#x27;s brake system to go into emergency when any application is made
; Kinematic envelope (KE)
: The outline of the space beside and above the track that must be kept clear of obstructions for the train to pass. This can be larger than the static clearance around an unmoving engine or car. See also: loading gauge and structure gauge
; Knuckle
: The articulating part of a coupler that locks automatically in its closed position to join rail cars; so named because its movement resembles that of the human finger

== L ==
; Lead track
: A non-main track from which several others branch within a short distance, such as within a rail yard or engine terminal
; Level crossing (LC), railroad crossing, railway crossing, train crossing, or grade crossing
: A crossing on one level (&quot;at-grade intersection&quot;)—without recourse to a bridge or tunnel—generally of a railway line by a road or path. Not to be confused with non-dead-end railways (see Rail crossing)
; Light engine
: A locomotive travelling on its own, or perhaps with just a caboose (brake van) attached
; Light rail
: A city-based rail system based on tram design standards that operates mostly in private rights-of-way separated from other traffic but sometimes, if necessary, mixed with other traffic in city streets. Light rail vehicles (LRVs) generally have a top speed of around though mostly operating at much lower speeds, more akin to road vehicles.
; Link and pin
: An obsolete method of coupling rail cars, consisting of manually dropping the coupling pin into the drawbar as the cars joined. Extremely hazardous to the brakemen of its day, it was outlawed in the United States by the Railroad Safety Appliance Act of 1893.
; Local train
: A train that stops at most, if not all, stations along its route
; Lunar
: An off-white color of railway signal light, like the Moon, achieved by the use of a clear lens of very light blue, to make it distinct from a light that has a broken lens.

== M ==
; Maglev
: A system of high speed train transportation that uses two sets of magnets: one set to repel and push the train up off the track, and another set to move the elevated train ahead, taking advantage of the lack of friction.
; Main generator
: The electric generator in a diesel–electric locomotive that is coupled directly to the prime mover and feeds electrical energy to the traction motors
; Main reservoir
: The compressed-air tank of a locomotive containing source air for the brakes and other pneumatic appliances
; Mallet
: A type of compound articulated locomotive designed by the Swiss mechanical engineer Anatole Mallet (pronounced &quot;mallay&quot;). See Compound engine.
; Manifest
: An express freight train carrying a variety of general merchandise
; Mars Light
: A nose-mounted mechanically oscillated light used to warn traffic of an approaching locomotive. Functionally replaced by ditch lights on modern locomotives.
; Mechanical semaphore signal
: A signal in which the aspect is conveyed by moving an arm
; Meet
: In rail transport operations, a meet occurs when two trains arrive at a location and pass each other on parallel tracks, such as on a siding, usually in opposing directions. This is also sometimes referred to as a crossing of two trains.
; Mikado type
: A steam locomotive with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement
:In the U.S., milk trains ran from the countryside to cities making numerous stops at minor depots to pick up cans of fresh milk, making them a colloquial expression for a very slow train.
: In the U. K., an aggregator for transporting milk from farms to dairies, such as British Railways Milk Trains; as these trains invariably ran very early in the morning, &quot;milk train&quot; became a colloquialism for a particularly early train.
; Modalohr
: An inter-modal car
; Mogul type
: A steam locomotive with a 2-6-0 wheel arrangement
: A track that is still serviceable but no trains are running on them.
; Mountain type
: A steam locomotive with a 4-8-2 wheel arrangement
; Mud ring

<text>Robert David Grusin (born June 26, 1934) is an American composer, arranger, producer, jazz pianist, and band leader. He has composed many scores for feature films and television and has won numerous awards for his soundtrack and record work, including an Academy Award and 10 Grammy Awards. Grusin was also a frequent collaborator with director Sydney Pollack, scoring many of his films like &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), &quot;Absence of Malice&quot; (1981), &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993), and &quot;Random Hearts&quot; (1999). In 1978, Grusin founded GRP Records with Larry Rosen, and was an early pioneer of digital recording.

==Early life==
Grusin was born in Littleton, Colorado, to Henri and Rosabelle (née de Poyster) Grusin. His family originates from the Gruzinsky princely line of the Bagrationi dynasty, the royal family that ruled the Kingdom of Georgia in the ninth to 19th centuries. In Slavic languages, &quot;Grusin&quot; is an ethnonym for Georgians.
 Grusin’s father, Henri, was a violinist of Jewish ancestry who was born and raised in Riga, Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire, from where he emigrated to the United States in 1913. Grusin&#x27;s mother, Rosabelle, was a pianist. He is the older brother of fellow jazz keyboardist, composer, and producer Don Grusin.

Grusin studied music at the University of Colorado at Boulder and graduated in 1956. His teachers included Cecil Effinger; and Wayne Scott, a pianist, arranger, and professor of jazz.

==Career==
Grusin produced his first single in 1962, &quot;Subways Are for Sleeping&quot;, and his first film score, for &quot;Divorce American Style&quot;, in 1967. Other scores followed, including &quot;The Graduate&quot; (1967), &quot;Winning&quot; (1969), &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot; (1973), &quot;The Midnight Man&quot; (1974), and &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975).

In 1978, Grusin founded GRP Records with his business partner Larry Rosen, and began producing some of the first commercial digital recordings. Grusin was the composer for &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981), &quot;Tootsie&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). In 1988, he won the Oscar for Best Original Score for &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;. Grusin composed the musical signatures for the 1984 TriStar Pictures logo (which was credited at the end of &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking Too&quot;) and the 1993 Columbia Pictures Television logo.

In 1998, Grusin ranked #5 and #8 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top 10 Jazz Artists, at mid-year and at year&#x27;s end, respectively, based on sales of his album &quot;Dave Grusin Presents &quot;West Side Story&quot;.&quot;

From 2000–11, Grusin concentrated on classical and jazz compositions, touring and recording with collaborators including jazz singer and lyricist Lorraine Feather and guitarist Lee Ritenour. Their album &quot;Harlequin&quot; won a Grammy Award in 1985. Their classical crossover albums, &quot;Two Worlds&quot; and &quot;Amparo&quot;, were nominated for Grammys.

Grusin has a filmography of about 100 titles. His many awards include an Oscar for best original score for &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot;, as well as Oscar nominations for &quot;The Champ&quot;, &quot;The Fabulous Baker Boys&quot;, &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;Havana&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, and &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. Grusin received a Best Original Song nomination for &quot;It Might Be You&quot; from the film &quot;Tootsie&quot;. Six of the 14 cuts on the soundtrack from &quot;The Graduate&quot; are his. Other film scores Grusin has composed include &quot;Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?&quot;, &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Hope Floats&quot;, &quot;Random Hearts&quot;, &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot;, and &quot;The Firm&quot;. He composed the original opening fanfare for film studio TriStar Pictures.

Grusin composed theme music for the TV programs &quot;Good Morning World&quot; (1967), &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot; (1968), &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; (1968), &quot;Dan August&quot; (1970), &quot;The Sandy Duncan Show&quot; (1971–72), &quot;Maude&quot; (1972), &quot;Good Times&quot; (1974), &quot;Baretta&quot; (1975), &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1982), and, for Televisa in Mexico, &quot;Tres Generaciones&quot; (1987). He composed music for individual episodes of each of those shows. Grusin&#x27;s other TV credits include &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (1966), &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1966), and &quot;Columbo: Prescription: Murder&quot; (1968). He composed and performed the 1984-1991 theme music for &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1968). Grusin wrote the music for the &quot;This Is America, Charlie Brown&quot; episode &quot;The Smithsonian and the Presidency&quot;, and two of the cues from the episode &quot;History Lesson&quot; and &quot;Breadline Blues&quot; (the latter covered by Kenny G) appear on the tribute album &quot;Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown&quot;. &quot;History Lesson&quot; also appears in the Amiga CDTV version of &quot;Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game&quot;.

In 1994, GRP was in charge of MCA&#x27;s jazz operations. Founders Grusin and Rosen left in the following year and were replaced by Tommy LiPuma. In 1997, Grusin and Rosen founded N2K Encoded Music, which was renamed N-Coded Music.

Grusin received honorary doctorates from Berklee College of Music in 1988 and University of Colorado, College of Music in 1989. He was initiated into the Beta Chi chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at the University of Colorado in 1991.

==Personal life==

Grusin has been married to Nan Newton for many years and they have three adult sons: Scott, Michael, and Stuart. He is also the stepfather of Nan&#x27;s adult daughter, Annie Vought. Grusin is the subject of a 2018 feature-length documentary, “Dave Grusin: Not Enough Time.”

<doc id="578505" wikidata="Q920360" url="?curid=578505" title="Emphatic consonant">
<text>In Semitic linguistics, an emphatic consonant is an obstruent consonant which originally contrasted, and often still contrasts, with an analogous voiced or voiceless obstruent by means of a secondary articulation. In specific Semitic languages, the members of the emphatic series may be realized as uvularized, pharyngealized, velarized or ejective, or by plain voicing contrast; for instance, in Arabic, emphasis involves retraction of the dorsum (or root) of the tongue, which has variously been described as velarization or pharyngealization depending on where the locus of the retraction is assumed to be. The term is also used, to a lesser extent, to describe cognate series in other Afro-Asiatic languages, where they are typically realized as ejective, implosive or pharyngealized consonants.

In Semitic studies, emphatic consonants are commonly transcribed using the convention of placing a dot under the closest plain consonant in the Latin alphabet. However, exceptions exist: original emphatic developed into in most Semitic languages; strictly speaking, it has thus ceased to be an emphatic version of and has become a different consonant, being most commonly transcribed as (rather than ) accordingly.

Within Arabic, the emphatic consonants vary in phonetic realization from dialect to dialect, but are typically realized as pharyngealized consonants. In Ethiopian Semitic and Modern South Arabian languages, they are realized as ejective consonants. While these sounds do not necessarily share any particular &quot;phonetic&quot; properties in common, most historically derive from a common source.

Five such &quot;emphatic&quot; phonemes are reconstructed for Proto-Semitic: 
An extra emphatic labial occurs in some Semitic languages, but it is unclear whether it was a phoneme in Proto-Semitic.
* The classical Ethiopian Semitic language Geʽez is unique among Semitic languages for contrasting all three of , , and . While and occur mostly in loanwords (especially from Greek), there are many other occurrences whose origin is less clear (such as &#x27;strike&#x27;, &#x27;wash clothes&#x27;).
* According to Hetzron, Hebrew developed an emphatic labial phoneme to represent unaspirated from Persian and Greek; this phoneme is not attested in Hebrew orthography.

General Modern Israeli Hebrew and Maltese are notable exceptions among Semitic languages to the presence of emphatic consonants. In both languages, they have been lost under the influence of Indo-European languages (chiefly Yiddish and Sicilian, respectively, though other languages may also have had an influence; see revival of the Hebrew language).

* In Hebrew, the letter tsadi (from Proto-Semitic , , ) remains distinct, but has been replaced by a non-pharygealized affricate . Emphatic has been merged with plain in non-lenited positions, but remains distinct post-vocally, where the plain consonant becomes (phonetically ), while the original emphatic does not. Semitic has been fully merged with plain .
* In Maltese, only emphatic (spelled ) remains distinct. It is still realised as a uvular stop in a few villages but has otherwise developed into a glottal consonant stop . All other emphatics have been merged into plain consonants. However, they are often still recognizable from special vocalic developments that they triggered before the mergers: compare (, from Arabic ) with (, from Arabic ). The emphatic prevented the from being raised to as it did with the plain ).

<doc id="578510" wikidata="Q163547" url="?curid=578510" title="Republic of Ireland national football team">
<text>The Republic of Ireland national football team () represents the Republic of Ireland in men&#x27;s international football. It is governed by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).

The team made their debut at the 1924 Summer Olympics, reaching the quarter-finals. Between 1924 and 1936, the team competed as the Irish Free State and from then until 1950, it was referred to by the FAI as Éire or Ireland. During the same period, another Ireland team also existed; this was overseen by the Irish Football Association (IFA) and had previously been the sole national team for the entire island of Ireland. In 1953, FIFA decreed that for competitive matches in tournaments that both Irish teams could enter, the FAI team would be officially called Republic of Ireland while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland was allowed to keep using the title Ireland by FIFA in the British Home Championship (which was discontinued in 1984). The Republic of Ireland was the first nation from outside the United Kingdom to defeat England at home, in a fixture played at Goodison Park, Liverpool, in 1949. The team reached the quarter-final stage of the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup, where they lost to the eventual champions Spain.

Under the guidance of Jack Charlton, the team enjoyed their most successful era, reaching their highest FIFA world ranking ever at sixth in August 1993, and qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 in their first appearance at the UEFA European Championship, reaching the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in their first appearance at the finals, as well as making the last 16 at the 1994 edition. Charlton&#x27;s successor Mick McCarthy lost out on the next two major tournaments but ultimately qualified for the 2002 World Cup, making it to the last 16, a feat repeated at the 2016 Euros by manager Martin O&#x27;Neill.

The team&#x27;s home stadium is the Aviva Stadium, in Dublin, although some of their home games have been played in other stadiums across the country. Their traditional colours are green shirts and white shorts. The position of manager is currently filled by Heimir Hallgrímsson. Séamus Coleman has served as team captain since 2016.

==History==

===1920s–1980s===
Between 1882 and 1924, Ireland was represented by a single national football team organised by the Belfast-based Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920, Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State (the latter in turn becoming Éire or Ireland after adopting a new Constitution in 1937, followed by declaring itself a republic in 1949.) Following the initial political upheavals surrounding Partition, a Dublin-based organisation calling itself the Football Association of the Irish Free State (FAIFS) split from the IFA in 1921 and began organising its own league and national football team.

In 1923, the FAIFS was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of football in the Irish Free State and at the 1924 Summer Olympics, the Irish Free State made their international debut. On 28 May, at the Stade Olympique, they beat Bulgaria 1–0, with Paddy Duncan scoring the team&#x27;s first-ever goal.
As a result, they qualified for the quarter-finals where they lost to the Netherlands. On 14 June 1924, the Irish Free State made their home debut against the United States, who had embarked on a brief European tour after competing in the same Summer Olympics. Ed Brookes scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 home win at Dalymount Park.

The Irish Free State did not play their next game until 21 March 1926, an away game against Italy lost 3–0. In subsequent years, the status of the Olympic Games football competition was downgraded and as a result, this game is widely regarded as the Irish Free State&#x27;s first official game. On 25 February 1934, the Irish Free State made their FIFA World Cup debut, drawing 4–4 with Belgium at Dalymount Park in a 1934 FIFA World Cup qualifier. Paddy Moore scored all four of the Free State&#x27;s goals and became the first player ever to score four goals in a World Cup game.

After 1936, they reverted to the designation &quot;Football Association of Ireland&quot; and began to refer to their team as &quot;Éire&quot; or &quot;Ireland&quot;. During this entire period, there were two Irish international football teams, chosen by two rival Associations. Both Associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Irish Free State-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and considered themselves entitled to select players from the entire island. At least 38 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams, however the overwhelming majority of these were Southerners who also agreed to play for the IFA team, with only a bare handful &quot;crossing the border&quot; in the other direction.

A 2–0 win over England at Goodison Park on 21 September 1949 was the first time England suffered a home defeat by a team outside the Home Countries of Scotland, Wales and the Ireland team run by the Belfast-based Irish FA. FIFA eventually intervened when both teams entered 1950 World Cup qualification, the first time they had entered the same competition. Four players – Tom Aherne, Reg Ryan, Davy Walsh, Con Martin – actually played for the two different teams in the same FIFA World Cup tournament. All four players concerned had been born in the Irish Free State and made their full international debut in FAI colours before agreeing to represent the IFA team. This may have alarmed the FAI since they subsequently lobbied FIFA to prevent the IFA from picking Southern-born players (as well as attempting to exert pressure on the players themselves, sometimes through their clubs). FIFA&#x27;s response was to restrict the eligibility of players on the basis of the (political) border, further ruling in 1953 that neither team could be referred to as &quot;Ireland&quot; in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter; i.e., initially the FIFA World Cup and subsequently the European Nations Cup (now the UEFA European Football Championship). FIFA decreed that the FAI team officially be called the &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; while the IFA team was to be named Northern Ireland.

The 1958 World Cup qualifiers saw the Republic of Ireland drawn with England. In their home game against England, Alf Ringstead put the hosts 1–0 up before John Atyeo equalised in the last minute to salvage a 1–1 draw for England. Under the rules of the day, a win for the Republic of Ireland would have meant a play-off with England for a place in the World Cup.

After reaching the quarter-finals of the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup, the Republic of Ireland was drawn to face Spain and Syria in 1966 World Cup qualifying. Despite Syria&#x27;s withdrawal, this was still considered a qualifying group with the Irish winning 1–0 at home and losing 4–1 away. This meant a play-off at the Parc des Princes in Paris, which Spain won 1–0 Eamon Dunphy made his Ireland debut in this game. The play-off was originally scheduled to take place at Wembley Stadium in London, home to a large Irish diaspora, but the FAI agreed with the Royal Spanish Football Federation to have the match moved to Paris, where a large Spanish diaspora lived. The FAI was criticised for this move to boost revenue from gate receipts.

In 1965, the Republic of Ireland team made history when selecting Manchester United full-back Shay Brennan for the senior national team. This was the first instance of a player born outside the Republic being selected to play for the national team due to having an Irish parent. Since then, many of the Republic&#x27;s most prominent players have been born in England, including Mark Lawrenson, David O&#x27;Leary, John Aldridge, Tony Cascarino and David Kelly. A number of players born in Scotland, including Ray Houghton, have since represented the Republic due to having Irish parentage. The selection rules were later relaxed to allow for the selection of players with an Irish grandparent.

In 1969, the FAI appointed Mick Meagan as the first permanent manager of the national side. His two years in charge were marked by exceptionally poor results, however with the team losing five out of six matches and gaining just one point in their 1970 World Cup qualification, and doing no better in the UEFA Euro 1972 qualifiers, leading to his dismissal. His replacement, Liam Tuohy, did a somewhat better in the 1974 qualification, and more importantly, oversaw major improvements to the national team&#x27;s training facilities and persuaded many English club sides to end their policies of not releasing Irish players for international games during the domestic season. Ultimately, however, the team still failed to qualify for the World Cup, and Tuohy resigned following a dispute over his wages. Johnny Giles became the side&#x27;s first player-manager in the 1970s. This was followed by the debut of a young Liam Brady and results improved markedly. The side missed out on the 1978 World Cup by two points, having defeated France at home during qualification. After a less than impressive performance at Euro 1980 qualifying, in which the team finished well behind group winners England and Northern Ireland, Giles resigned, saying that he had taken the national side as far as he could.

Eoin Hand took over as manager for the 1982 World Cup qualifiers, and once more the Republic of Ireland narrowly missed out on qualification, this time on goal difference behind France, whom they had defeated at home once more. Disappointing qualifying campaigns for both Euro 1984 and the 1986 World Cup followed, ending Hand&#x27;s time in charge.

===1986–1995: The golden generation===
In 1986, the Republic of Ireland appointed Jack Charlton, a top rated English manager who had been part of England&#x27;s World Cup-winning side of 1966. During the 1970s, he had developed Middlesbrough into a side which provided many players to the dominant Liverpool team of the time.

After taking charge of the Republic of Ireland, Charlton influenced changes in the national side which resulted in the most successful period of its history, qualifying for two World Cups and a European Championship. Prominent players in this period included Paul McGrath, Packie Bonner, Niall Quinn, and the Liverpool trio of Ray Houghton, John Aldridge and Ronnie Whelan.

Ireland&#x27;s first appearance at a major finals tournament came in Euro 1988. With Ireland&#x27;s fixtures already complete, qualification was secured through Gary Mackay&#x27;s 87th-minute goal in Sofia when Scotland beat Bulgaria 1–0; the Scottish win left Ireland top of the group. In spite of the enforced absence of Liam Brady and Mark Lawrenson from their squad, in the finals in West Germany, Ireland shocked Europe by beating England 1–0 in Stuttgart with a header from Ray Houghton in their competitive debut; drew 1–1 with the Soviet Union in Hannover, with Ronnie Whelan the scorer; and lost to eventual champions the Netherlands 1–0 in Gelsenkirchen, coming within seven minutes of a draw that would have meant a semi-final place.

The Republic of Ireland&#x27;s longest competitive winning streak was achieved in 1989 during the 1990 World Cup qualifying campaign. Five games against Spain, Northern Ireland, Hungary and Malta twice, were all wins. Subsequently, the side made it to the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Three draws in the group stage against England, Egypt and the Netherlands were enough to make the knockout stage. Virtually the entire country watched as they beat Romania on penalties, with Packie Bonner making a vital save and David O&#x27;Leary scoring the decisive spot-kick. Ireland was then beaten 1–0 by hosts Italy in the quarter-final at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. During the tournament, the team had an audience with Pope John Paul II, the only team to do so.

After missing out on Euro 1992 (despite being unbeaten in qualifying), the Republic of Ireland qualified for the 1994 World Cup, held in the United States, via a qualification group which again included Spain and Northern Ireland, and ended with the Republic finishing above European champions Denmark by a very narrow margin (goals scored). In their first match at the 1994 finals, they beat the previous World Cup hosts and third-place finishers, Italy, 1–0 in their opening game at Giants Stadium just outside New York City, but lost to Mexico 2–1 at the Citrus Bowl in the heat and humidity of Orlando, Florida. They ended the group stage with a 0–0 draw with Norway at Giants Stadium, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. With these results, they made it to the second round, eventually losing 2–0 to the Netherlands in Orlando.

Ireland finished second behind Portugal in Euro 1996 qualifying&#x27;s Group 6, but narrowly missed out on the Euro 1996 finals after losing 2–0 to the Netherlands in the qualifying play-off. Anfield in Liverpool was chosen as the neutral venue for the match between the two worst-ranked group runners-up, with Patrick Kluivert scoring both goals to send his team through. It was Jack Charlton&#x27;s final game as manager.

===1996–2007: Post Golden Generation and decline===
Charlton was replaced by Mick McCarthy but Ireland still missed out on the next two major tournaments. Ireland just managed to finish second to Romania in their 1998 World Cup qualification campaign after Tony Cascarino scored a late goal to win the away match with Lithuania. A play-off with Belgium followed, with the match at Lansdowne Road finishing in a 1–1 draw, the match in Belgium finishing 2–1 to the home team and substitute David Connolly being sent off in the latter, preventing Ireland from progressing to the 1998 World Cup. FIFA awarded the FIFA Fair Play Award for 1997 to the Irish supporters &quot;for their exemplary behaviour at Ireland team matches, especially the FIFA World Cup qualifying play-offs against Belgium&quot;. Ireland&#x27;s opponents in UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying Group 8 were Yugoslavia, Croatia, Malta and North Macedonia (then known as FYRO Macedonia (see Macedonia naming dispute)). North Macedonia scored a last-minute equaliser that denied Ireland top spot in the group; instead, they faced Turkey in a play-off to decide which team would participate in Euro 2000. The match in Dublin finished in a 1–1 draw, although Turkey qualified through the away goals rule after a 0–0 draw, at the end of which Tony Cascarino became involved in a fight and retired from international football.

Ireland took on both Portugal and the Netherlands in 2002 World Cup qualifiers in UEFA&#x27;s Group 2, ending the group in second place with 24 points from 10 matches (seven victories and three draws). Despite this unbeaten run, Ireland were drawn in a play-off with Iran. The match in Dublin finished in a 2–0 victory to Ireland with goals from Ian Harte (penalty) and Robbie Keane, while the match in Tehran, played in front of 100,000 spectators, finished in a 1–0 win for Iran. McCarthy thus managed to lead Ireland to the 2002 World Cup final stages, though only for the team to lose inspirational captain Roy Keane due to the pair&#x27;s infamous public spat in Saipan. 1–1 draws with Cameroon and Germany were followed by a 3–0 victory over Saudi Arabia in Group E. The Irish once again progressed to the knockout stage, only losing narrowly 3–2 on penalties to Spain in Suwon after Robbie Keane&#x27;s last minute equalising penalty kick forced the game into extra time.

After a poor start to qualifying for Euro 2004, McCarthy was replaced by Brian Kerr, but he too struggled to guide the side to the tournament or the subsequent 2006 World Cup in Germany, and was ultimately sacked in October 2005. Kerr was replaced by Steve Staunton (assisted by Bobby Robson in the position of &quot;international football consultant&quot;) in January 2006. Under Staunton, results varied widely but the team still failed to qualify for Euro 2008 and Staunton lost the position in October 2007. His reign included a humiliating 5–2 defeat to Cyprus during the qualifiers&#x27; Group D, one of the worst defeats in the team&#x27;s history.

===2008–2019: Trapattoni &amp; O&#x27;Neill spells in charge and Mick McCarthy&#x27;s return===
Giovanni Trapattoni was appointed manager in February 2008 following a spell with assistant coach Don Givens in charge. Trapattoni went through all ten first round 2010 World Cup qualifying games unbeaten, winning four of the ten games. Ireland lost out on a place in the finals, however, after a controversial, narrow loss to France in the play-offs. Ireland went down 1–0 in the first leg, and lost 2–1 on aggregate, with William Gallas scoring a controversial goal in extra time in the second leg after Thierry Henry had handled the ball before crossing for Gallas to score. This followed another controversy over FIFA&#x27;s last-minute decision to seed the play-off draw.

In 2011, Ireland hosted and won the inaugural Nations Cup with wins against Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland without conceding a goal.

In their Euro 2012 qualifying group, Ireland finished second, losing only the home fixture against Russia. They thus reached the play-offs and were drawn against Estonia, whom they beat 5–1 on aggregate. Euro 2012 was Ireland&#x27;s first major tournament since 2002, but in Group C they lost all three matches, against Croatia, Spain, and Italy. UEFA, however, announced a special award for the fans of the Irish team, who notably sang in the last few minutes against Spain, despite trailing 4–0. 

Ireland was drawn in Group C of UEFA&#x27;s 2014 World Cup qualification alongside Germany, Sweden, Austria, the Faroe Islands and Kazakhstan. On 12 October, Ireland suffered their largest ever competitive home defeat, 6–1 against Germany, at the Aviva Stadium. Ireland then lost against Sweden and Austria in early September 2013, effectively ending the qualification campaign, and Giovanni Trapattoni resigned as team manager the following day. Noel King was appointed interim senior manager on 23 September 2013 following his resignation.

On 5 November 2013, the FAI announced that Martin O&#x27;Neill would be Trapattoni&#x27;s replacement as manager, with former team captain Roy Keane as his assistant. They assumed their roles when the team met on 11 November where they won against Latvia 3–0 and drew against Poland 0–0.

For the Euro 2016 qualification phase, the Republic of Ireland was drawn in Group D against Georgia, Germany, Gibraltar, Poland and Scotland. The team played against Gibraltar for the first time, beating them 7–0, and achieved an away draw against World Cup champions, Germany, a few days later in October 2014.

On 8 October 2015, the Republic of Ireland beat world champions Germany 1–0 in a Euro 2016 qualifier at the Aviva Stadium. Shane Long scored the game&#x27;s only goal with an excellent finish in the 70th minute, rewarding the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s impressive defensive display. The result, hailed as one of the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s greatest, guaranteed the Republic of Ireland a play-off place at least, with hopes of automatic qualification still a reality going into the final group game against Poland in Warsaw. A win, or a draw of 2–2 or more, would guarantee at least second place in the group and ensure automatic qualification for the finals in France. The Republic of Ireland, however, lost 2–1, thus entering them into the play-offs.

The draw for the Euro 2016 Play-off was held in Nyon, Switzerland, on 18 October 2015. Ireland were unseeded in the draw, meaning they could face one of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, Sweden or Hungary. Ireland were drawn against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the top seeded team in the play-off. The only previous meeting between the teams resulted in a 1–0 win for the Republic of Ireland in a friendly in 2012, Shane Long scoring the game&#x27;s only goal. Owing to injuries and suspensions, Ireland had only the &quot;B&quot; squad available for the first leg of the play-off, played in Bilino Polje Stadium. A goal from Robbie Brady almost secured a victory for the Irish until Edin Džeko equalised 1–1 to end off the match. In the second leg played at the Aviva Stadium, Jonathan Walters scored two goals leading to a 2–0 victory for the Irish. In the end, Ireland won the play-off 3–1 on aggregate, qualifying them for Euro 2016.

At the tournament&#x27;s final stages in France, Ireland were drawn into Group E against Italy, Belgium and Sweden. In their opener at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, Paris, Wes Hoolahan scored the opener with a spectacular half-volley off a Séamus Coleman cross, but Sweden equalised after Ciaran Clark headed into his own net attempting to clear a cross from Zlatan Ibrahimović, leading to a 1–1 draw. At the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux against Belgium, the Belgians cruised to a 3–0 victory after two goals from Romelu Lukaku and one from Axel Witsel, leaving Ireland needing to win their final match against already qualified Italy to qualify for the knockout stage. Against Italy at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Villeneuve-d&#x27;Ascq, Lille, Ireland played strongly but were five minutes plus stoppage time away from elimination when Robbie Brady headed in Hoolahan&#x27;s cross. The Republic held on to win 1–0, sending Ireland through as one of the four best third-place teams. On 26 June, Ireland played France in the round of 16 in Lyon. Ireland took the lead in the match with an early penalty from Robbie Brady, but France went on to win 2–1 to advance to the quarter-finals.

The 2018 World Cup qualification draw took place on 25 July 2015 when the team were drawn in Group D against Austria, Georgia, Moldova, Serbia and Wales. Ireland started qualifying strongly with a hard-fought 2–2 draw away to Serbia preceding two impressive victories over Georgia and Moldova.

On 12 November 2016, Ireland beat Austria in Vienna to go top of the 2018 World Cup qualifying group. However, a run of three draws against Wales, Austria and Georgia followed by a devastating 1–0 loss at home to Serbia looked to have diminished any chances of the Republic of Ireland qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. The Republic of Ireland were soon back on form however after securing a 2–0 victory at home to Moldova thanks to a brace from Daryl Murphy.

On 9 October 2017, Ireland defeated Wales 1–0 in Cardiff to qualify for the qualification play-offs after a James McClean goal fired Ireland to second place in the group. They went on to play Denmark in the play-offs.

In the first leg of the play-offs on 11 November, Ireland drew 0–0 against Denmark in Copenhagen. In the second leg on 14 November in Dublin, Ireland lost 5–1 to Denmark after taking the lead in the game. Shane Duffy&#x27;s early header looked to have given the Republic of Ireland hope in qualifying for their first World Cup since 2002, however, an Andreas Christensen goal, a Christian Eriksen hat-trick and a late Nicklas Bendtner penalty shattered Irish dreams.

Ireland competed in the first UEFA Nations League from September to November in 2018 and went on to finish bottom of their group, picking up just two points in two 0–0 draws against Denmark and were relegated to League C for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League.

On 21 November 2018, Martin O&#x27;Neill and Roy Keane left their posts with the Ireland senior team following a run of poor results.

The FAI confirmed on the weekend of 23 November 2018, Mick McCarthy&#x27;s appointment as the Republic of Ireland manager after the 59-year-old agreed to return to the role following a meeting with chief executive John Delaney. McCarthy appointed Terry Connor as his assistant, who he had worked with at Wolverhampton Wanderers and Ipswich Town respectively. Ireland&#x27;s record goalscorer Robbie Keane was announced as a member of the backroom team. He started poorly with an unconvincing 1–0 win over Gibraltar after having previously beaten them 7–0 and 4–0 in the past. However, a good performance against Georgia saw another 1–0 win thanks to a Conor Hourihane free kick. The wins left them top of the group, a position they still held three matches later in mid-September 2019, with just three matches remaining. Ireland failed to automatically qualify and were placed into a semi-final play-off against Slovakia.

===2020–2023: Stephen Kenny era===
On 4 April 2020, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, McCarthy stood down as manager and was immediately replaced by Stephen Kenny. On 3 September 2020, Ireland drew 1–1 away to Bulgaria in Kenny&#x27;s first match as manager. The following month, Ireland played its postponed Euro 2020 semi-final play-off match against Slovakia. The match finished 0–0 after extra time and a 4–2 penalty shootout defeat saw Slovakia progress to the play-off final.

In March 2021, Ireland played two 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers; losing 3–2 away to Serbia before losing at home 1–0 to Luxembourg. Ireland would ultimately fail to qualify for the World Cup as they ended the campaign with a third-place finish in their group.

On 8 June 2021, Chiedozie Ogbene became the first African-born player to represent the Republic of Ireland, when he made his debut in a 0–0 draw away to Hungary.

In the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying, Ireland was placed in Group B. After recording only two wins against Gibraltar, Ireland finished the group in fourth place behind France, the Netherlands and Greece, failing to qualify for the fourth tournament in a row.

In October 2023, the Republic of Ireland was confirmed as co-host of UEFA Euro 2028 alongside England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However, due to the unusually high number of involved associations in the bid, Ireland was not granted automatic qualification to the tournament. Instead, all teams will participate in qualifying, with two spots allocated to the best performing hosts which are unable to qualify on merit. Ireland will host games at Aviva Stadium.

=== 2023–present ===
Stephen Kenny&#x27;s contract was due to expire at the end of 2023, with the manager himself admitting after a friendly against New Zealand that while he would like to continue in the position, his &quot;instinct [was] that’s not going to happen.&quot; The match was eventually confirmed to be his last, as the FAI announced on 22 November 2023 that Kenny&#x27;s contract would not be renewed. While Kenny recorded only six wins in 29 competitive matches during his tenure and is widely considered as one of Ireland&#x27;s worst managers in modern history, he was also credited with introducing younger players to the squad.

In the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League B, Ireland was drawn in Group 2 along with England, Finland and Greece.

==Team image==
=== Kits ===
Traditionally, the team has played in a home strip of green shirt, white shorts and green socks. The second strip is usually the reverse of these colours, although there have been exceptions, such as an orange shirt in the late 1990s. Squad numbers are either white with an orange trim, on the home shirts, or green with an orange trim. The shirts worn in the team&#x27;s first international match at the 1924 Olympics were St. Patrick&#x27;s blue; this was their change jersey at the time, but the match was against Bulgaria, whose home strip was green. In 2021, Ireland again wore a blue jersey in a friendly against Qatar to commemorate the FAI&#x27;s centenary.

A limited edition grey shirt was used just once, in a match against Wales on 17 November 2007. A black jersey with a green stripe across the chest was worn in the final game of the 2011 Nations Cup against Scotland and in a friendly against Italy in Liège, Belgium.

The previous kit was supplied by Umbro since 1994. In March 2009, Umbro signed a deal with the FAI to keep them as kit suppliers to the team until 2020. However New Balance became kit suppliers in August 2017. This deal only lasted 3 years before Umbro returned as kit suppliers in November 2020. Umbro&#x27;s return was also brief however, with Castore taking over in 2023.

===Home stadium and other venues===
Since the 1980s, most home matches have been played at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, the national rugby stadium owned by the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU). The ground was closed for redevelopment in 2007, with the replacement ground, the Aviva Stadium, opening on 14 May 2010. The first football match in the Aviva was Manchester United against a League of Ireland XI side, managed by Damien Richardson, on 4 August 2010. Manchester United won the game 7–1, with Park Ji-Sung scoring the first goal in the Aviva Stadium. Aviva Stadium is jointly owned by the IRFU and FAI, although it will return to solely IRFU ownership on expiry of the current 60-year lease. The first football international played at Lansdowne Road by a FAI team was a friendly against Italy in 1971 (an IFA team first played in 1878 against England); a 5–0 victory over San Marino in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D match on 15 November 2006 was the last game there before the reconstruction. The all-seater capacity of Lansdowne Road prior to the renovation was 36,000, although higher attendances, using the standing only areas, were permitted for friendly matches. The Aviva Stadium&#x27;s status as an all-seater increased capacity for competitive games to 51,700. The opening game at the Aviva Stadium, a controversial 1–0 friendly defeat to Argentina, was noted for Robbie Keane securing his membership in the FIFA Century Club and manager Giovanni Trapattoni&#x27;s absence due to surgery, with assistant manager Marco Tardelli taking charge.

With the announcement of the rebuilding of Lansdowne Road, a new venue was required to stage the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s home internationals. The only stadium in Ireland deemed suitable to stage international football was the 82,300 capacity Croke Park, home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). To accommodate this, the GAA temporarily relaxed its rule governing the playing of &quot;foreign&quot; games on its property. Initially, four UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group D matches were played at Croke Park in 2007, resulting in two wins and two draws. The GAA initially agreed to allow the FAI use until the end of 2008, and later extended the permission until the completion of Aviva Stadium. The Hill 16 end of Croke Park is a terrace, which means like Lansdowne Road before it, the capacity of the stadium was reduced to around 74,500 for competitive matches as temporary seating must be used.

Prior to the 1980s, the Republic of Ireland played most home games at Dalymount Park, home of Bohemians, but progressively more games were played at Lansdowne Road following a safety review which reduced Dalymount&#x27;s capacity. The last international match played there was against Morocco in 1990. The Republic of Ireland have also played home matches in Tolka Park (twice) and the RDS Arena in Dublin as well at the Mardyke and Flower Lodge grounds in Cork. These games in Cork were, until 2009, the only two home Irish internationals played outside of Dublin. During the construction of the Aviva Stadium, two friendly games were played in Thomond Park, Limerick, in 2009. Two further friendlies were played in the RDS Arena in May 2010. Ireland played a friendly against Belarus in Cork&#x27;s 7,000 capacity Turners Cross stadium in May 2016.

===Media coverage===
Ireland matches currently broadcast by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) (qualifiers only), Sky Sports, and highlights on Virgin Media Television. Sky Sports shows most of Ireland&#x27;s friendly matches, while RTÉ shows competitive games such as World Cup and European Championship qualifiers. RTÉ briefly lost its broadcast rights in 2002 when the FAI controversially sold them in a multi-million deal to Sky Sports, a subscription based satellite channel. The decision was criticised by fans and politicians, and the Consumers&#x27; Association of Ireland (CAI) described the FAI as &quot;greedy&quot;. The FAI was eventually forced to reverse its decision and to allow RTÉ to continue its broadcasts after the government intervened to stop the sale of important Irish sporting events to non-terrestrial television broadcasters. RTÉ (for qualifiers) and Eir Sport (for friendlies) will hold the rights until 2018.

===Selection and nationality issues===
The selection of young players born in Northern Ireland, especially those who have already represented Northern Ireland at youth level, into Republic of Ireland national teams has been controversial, as these players are able to claim Irish nationality even though born and brought up outside the Republic&#x27;s territory. This has led to accusations of unfairness and predatory behaviour. In Northern Ireland it is seen by Northern Ireland supporters as having the effect of dividing international football in their country along sectarian lines, whereby Nationalists will declare for the Republic of Ireland while Unionists continue to play for Northern Ireland. It has also been argued that it is actually the sectarian divisions, which already existed in Northern Irish football, that are a factor in a number of players switching to the Republic. The switches of Darron Gibson, and James McClean brought matters to a head in the 2010,&#x27;s as a previous unspoken reluctance to be seen to &#x27;pilfer&#x27; players, and some ambiguity on the rules, broke down after the Good Friday Agreement clarified in both British and Irish law the right of anyone born in Northern Ireland to Irish citizenship as a birthright. FIFA accepting this gave any northern born players the right to switch to play for the Republic unless they had a full competitive cap for Northern Ireland. Traditionally, those in Northern Ireland who identify as Irish, predominantly Catholics and nationalists, support the Republic of Ireland team. Martin O&#x27;Neill, captain of the 1982 Northern Ireland team that reached the World Cup that year in Spain, has managed the Republic, and Brendan Rodgers, and Neil Lennon, both high profile Northern Ireland football figures have been linked with the next vacancy.

Between 1921 and 1969, a committee of selectors chose the team, on occasions a coach or team manager was appointed; Mick Meagan was the first manager to actually select the team. Managers from the periods in which the national side was known as the &quot;Irish Free State&quot; or simply &quot;Ireland&quot; are obscure and many are not currently known, however it is known that Val Harris, Bill Lacey and Alex Stevenson managed the side.

===FIFA World Cup===
In the 1934 qualifiers, Paddy Moore (v. Belgium) became the first player anywhere to score 4 goals in a World Cup match. For the 1950 World Cup, after three qualified teams withdrew, FIFA invited the FAI to compete as a replacement, however they declined. During qualification for the 1962 World Cup, it was the only qualifying tournament in which the team had a 0% record. During qualification for the 1966 World Cup, Ireland reached their first play-off against Spain. Goal difference did not count, so a play-off was contested at the Stade Colombes, Paris, and Ireland failed to progress. Ireland almost qualified but lost on goal difference to France in a tough and tight group. Fans lamented some controversial refereeing decisions.

For the 1990 World Cup, Ireland reached the quarter finals of the tournament for the first time in their history. It was Ireland&#x27;s first participation in a FIFA World Cup. Ireland played England in the first drawing 1–1. Ireland drew the next two matches but ultimately qualified for the knockout stages where they played Romania. The match ended 0–0 and Ireland won on penalties 5–4 which sent Ireland into the quarter-final showdown against the tournament host Italy. There Ireland lost 1–0 via a Salvatore Schillaci goal in the 38th minute that sent the Irish out of the competition.
In 1994, Ireland participated in their second consecutive World Cup. This time they were drawn with Mexico, Norway and Italy. Ireland won their first game against Italy which was the first time Ireland had won a World Cup match and their first victory over Italy with a notable goal from Ray Houghton. Ireland lost against Mexico in the second group match and drew with Norway but still made to the knockout phase where they faced the Netherlands. Ireland lost 2–0.

For the 1998 qualification campaign, Ireland scraped into the play-offs largely due to Tony Cascarino&#x27;s seven goals in ten games. They lost in the play-off against Belgium, drawing 1–1 in the first leg then losing 2–1 in the second leg. Although for next campaign Ireland were drawn with two big European nations, the Netherlands, Portugal. Ireland went the whole campaign unbeaten, beating the Netherlands 1–0 in the process; Jason McAteer scored the sole goal.

At the start of the tournament, captain Roy Keane and manager Mick McCarthy where involved in a &quot;bust up&quot; and Keane was sent home. Despite this, McCarthy did not call up a replacement and continued with 22 players. Ireland drew in their first match against Cameroon and in their second match they drew again against the tournaments runner up Germany. In Ireland&#x27;s final group match, they defeated Saudi Arabia, their second ever victory in a World Cup, and progressed to the round of 16. There, they met Spain, and lost in a penalty shoot-out.

After failure to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, Ireland reached a play-off against France for a place at the 2010 tournament.

France&#x27;s Thierry Henry&#x27;s handball stirred international controversy after the move set up William Gallas to score in extra-time of the second leg of the play-off; the referee did not notice and allowed the goal to stand, leading to widespread media controversy, protests at the French embassy in Dublin and comments from senior government officials from both countries.
:&quot;*Draws include knockout matches decided via penalty shoot-out.&quot;

===UEFA European Championship===
Ireland reached the quarter-finals of the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup, but failed to qualify for the final tournament after losing on aggregate to Spain.

Ireland did not qualify for a European Championship until Euro 1988. On 12 June 1988 in Stuttgart, the Irish team took to the pitch in its first match at a major championship finals against England. Ray Houghton of Liverpool scored the only goal of the match as Ireland recorded a memorable and historic victory. The game is fondly remembered in Irish folklore through the song &quot;Joxer goes to Stuttgart&quot; by Irish folk legend Christy Moore. Ireland took on the former Soviet Union next and took the lead late in the first half via a spectacular volley from Liverpool&#x27;s Ronnie Whelan. Unfortunately for both Whelan and Ireland the lead was cancelled out midway through the second half by Oleh Protasov as the match ended in a 1–1 draw. In their final match, Ireland lost out to the Netherlands 1–0.

It was not until 2011 that Ireland clinched a place at another European Championship, qualifying for Euro 2012 with a 5–1 aggregate victory over Estonia. At the tournament itself, however, Ireland lost all three of its matches and conceded nine goals, the nation&#x27;s worst performance in a major tournament to date.

Ireland qualified to Euro 2016 following a play-off victory over Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the group stages they drew 1–1 with Sweden, having initially taken the lead through a Wes Hoolahan strike, before being beaten 3–0 by Belgium in the following game. However, a 1–0 victory over Italy in their final game, courtesy of a late header from Robbie Brady, earned the side a spot in the round of 16, the first time the team had ever advanced from the group stage at a European Championship. In the round of 16, Ireland faced the hosts France and, after taking an early lead through a Brady penalty, were beaten 2–1.

===Opponents===

The team&#x27;s head-to-head records against all 80 nations whom they have played to date ( &#x27;B&#x27; internationals were played against Italy and West Germany in the past), including friendly internationals: Three of these teams no longer exist (Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia), so Ireland have played against 80 of the 211 FIFA members: 52 UEFA, 8 CONMEBOL, 7 CAF, 6 CONCACAF, 6 AFC and 1 OFC members as of 9 June 2022. The only UEFA members against whom Ireland have not played are Kosovo and Slovenia.

<text>The Tech Interactive (formerly The Tech Museum of Innovation, commonly known as The Tech) is a science and technology center that offers hands-on activities, labs, design challenges and other STEAM education resources. It is located in downtown San Jose, California, adjacent to the Plaza de César Chávez.

==Description==

The building has a distinctive mango and azure color, and has three floors. On the lower level there is a complex multi-story sculpture titled &quot;Origin&quot;, inside a cylindrical tower. The artwork portrays relationships among art, technology, and natural resources of the earth. Near the entrance to the building, there is &quot;Science on a Roll&quot;, a popular rolling ball sculpture by George Rhoads. The front wall is inscribed with quotations from iconic Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Bill Hewlett, David Packard, Bob Noyce, and Gordon Moore. The building was designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta.

The IMAX Dome Theater, opened in 1998 and upgraded since then, shows mainstream movies as well as educational films. It is Northern California&#x27;s only domed IMAX theater and has the first dome laser projector in the world, seating up to 280 people.

The Tech is a registered 501(c)(3) organization.

==History==
Planning began in 1978 by members of the Junior League of Palo Alto, with later assistance by the San Jose Junior League. The City of San Jose promised funding for a Technology Center of Silicon Valley in the 1980s, but progress was slow.

The first temporary exhibit opened in 1990; The Garage, named in homage to the HP Garage, was housed in San Jose&#x27;s former convention center. On October 31, 1998, a brand-new facility was inaugurated, named The Tech Museum of Innovation. In May 2019, the organization was renamed as The Tech Interactive and announced a partnership with Discovery Education.

In 2018, an expansion of Tech Interactive by was proposed, as part of a major high-rise office development in Park Habitat.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, The Tech Interactive temporarily closed for in-person visits in March, 2020, and published online STEM resources through &quot;The Tech Interactive at Home&quot;, in English, and &quot;The Tech Interactive en Casa&quot;, in Spanish.

== Programs ==

=== The Tech for Global Good ===

The Tech for Global Good is a program aimed at inspiring young people to become problem-solvers who make the world a better place. It evolved from The Tech Awards, a yearly ceremony known as the Oscars of Silicon Valley in which individuals and organizations were recognized for their technological contributions to improving the human condition. In 2016, The Tech announced it was expanding The Tech Awards program from a once-a-year event to a year-round program with educational materials and exhibits. Since then, Tech for Global Good has focused every year on a different theme, such as health care or data. It honors organizations under that theme as its laureates for the year, focusing on their problem-solving abilities in lesson plans, videos and other materials for students.

=== The Tech Challenge ===
The Tech Challenge is a design challenge competition for students Grades 4–12. Since its inception in 1988, more than 25,000 students have participated in the program, in which teams of students use the engineering design process to solve a real-world problem. In past years, participants have been asked to design and build a hovercraft; a structure to withstand an earthquake; and a device to deliver water, among other challenges. One of the program&#x27;s key goals is to engage students underrepresented in STEM fields.

=== The Tech Academies ===
The Tech Academies program, launched in 2014, provides in-depth professional development for educators to help them integrate high-quality STEM curriculum in their classrooms in Silicon Valley. The two-year Tech Academies Fellowship program, through The Tech and San José State University’s College of Science, trains educators in STEM instruction, with a focus on engineering and computer science. In 2020, the Tech Academies program received the EdCom award for Innovation in Museum Education from the American Alliance of Museums, and in 2019 it won the Excellence in Museum Education award from the California Association of Museums and the office of the state superintendent of education.

=== School programs ===
The Tech offers in-person and virtual field trips to school groups from September to June each year. 

The Tech offers field trip scholarships to underserved schools.

<doc id="578515" wikidata="Q5538423" url="?curid=578515" title="George Davis (robber)">
<text>George Davis (born 1941) is an armed robber, born in Bletchley, England and active in England. He became known through a successful campaign by friends and supporters to free him from prison after his wrongful conviction in March 1975, for an armed payroll robbery at the London Electricity Board (LEB) offices in Ilford, Greater London, on 4 April 1974. Following his release, Davis was jailed for two cases of armed robbery.

==Evidence==
A number of blood samples (matching different blood groups) were recovered and formed part of the prosecution case. Of four accused, only Davis was convicted. At a number of specific locations, Davis was identified but the blood obtained from the location did not match his; neither did the blood match any of his co-accused.

A further complication turned on the fact that Davis might never have been committed for trial from the lower courts had blood test results been disclosed at the committal stage. Although it subsequently became clear that evidence had by then become available to police, it was suppressed and this abuse of due process became one of the core allegations relied upon by those campaigning for the release of Davis.
&quot;The blood samples taken from ... Davis ... at Walthamstow on 18 May 1974 were passed on to the Yard&#x27;s Senior Scientific Officer, Peter Martin, on 21 May and he reported his negative findings to the police officer in charge of the case on 20 June. At as late as November 1974 on a third bail application, this time before a judge in chambers, and after committals had been completed (28 October) the police were saying that they still awaited the blood results from forensic.&quot;

==Campaign for release==
===Public activism===
On 19 August 1975, while Davis was serving a 20-year prison sentence for the Ilford LEB robbery, his supporters dug holes in the pitch and poured oil over one end of the wicket at the Headingley Cricket Ground, preventing further play in the Test match between England and Australia. This direct action protest by relatives and friends of George Davis was accompanied by Davis Campaign graffiti proclaiming &quot;FREE GEORGE DAVIS ... JUSTICE FOR GEORGE DAVIS ... GEORGE DAVIS IS INNOCENT ... SORRY IT HAD TO [BE] DONE&quot;. Three men and one woman were tried for this incident, and one, Peter Chappell, was eventually jailed for 18 months. The Davis campaigners who were remanded to prison to await trial for the Headingley sabotage continued their campaigning in support of one another within the prison system. One, Geraldine Hughes, refused to accept bail until it had also been granted to all of her co-accused. The campaign was also characterised by the graffiti “GEORGE DAVIS IS INNOCENT OK” or some variant thereof, in plain white paint, appearing on dozens of walls and bridges in London and on motorways.

===Celebrity support===
Roger Daltrey of The Who went on stage in 1975 wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;George Davis Is Innocent&quot;. &quot;George Davis Is Innocent&quot; was a song on Sham 69&#x27;s 1978 debut album &quot;Tell Us the Truth&quot;, and the song &quot;The Cockney Kids Are Innocent&quot; ends with a namecheck. Patrik Fitzgerald also showed support with &quot;George&quot; on the 1979 EP &quot;The Paranoid Ward&quot;. Davis received a namecheck in the Duran Duran song &quot;Friends of Mine&quot; on the album &quot;Duran Duran&quot; (1981): the chorus begins &quot;Georgie Davis is coming out&quot;.

The back cover of the Tom Robinson Band&#x27;s LP &quot;Power in the Darkness&quot; (1978) contains a cropped photo of the band seated on a street in front of a wall; the 2004 CD issue of that album shows the uncropped photo, showing the wall contained the graffito &quot;GEORGE DAVIS IS GUILTY&quot;.

===Media sympathy===
Before Chappell&#x27;s 1976 trial and conviction there was media criticism of the decision by the courts to refuse bail to the Headingley defendants (for example &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; editorial &quot;WHEN TO GIVE BAIL&quot;, 28 August 1975) and eventually bail was granted to all of them. Bail conditions were stringent and denied the four Headingley accused the right to discuss Davis&#x27;s wrongful conviction in public.

===Related campaigns===
Importantly, the original campaign to free Davis overlapped with, variously influenced, and was in turn influenced by other criminal justice campaigns in London, particularly the Free George Ince Campaign. Ince, another London victim of identification evidence, was also eventually freed. Although the &quot;EAST END SOLIDARITY CAMPAIGN...TO STOP EAST END FIT UPS&quot; (October 1975, UPAL/INCE Campaign political poster) had pre-dated the Davis Campaign, it went on to parallel it.

Both campaigns had support from London political activists who had a history of organising radical defence campaigns around the criminal justice system. In particular, among these core activists (who had supported and helped organise &quot;defence campaigns&quot; in connection with The Angry Brigade arrests and criminal prosecutions) were a number who went on to establish &quot;Up Against The Law&quot; (UPAL), a London-based &quot;political collective&quot;. This Collective publicised the Ince case and went on to produce the most detailed publicly available investigation of the 1974 Davis Case armed robbery.

In September 1975, Peter Chappell while awaiting trial in prison for the August 1975 Headingley sabotage, wrote to UPAL:
&quot;When this campaign started 18 months ago I was completely on my own and, if the truth were known, I was probably being labelled as a well meaning nut case, even in East London with no friends at all that I could seriously talk to about Davis’s case… I value UPAL’S help a great deal … I thought that I must find other people and that if I make sacrifices then sooner or later others would join the fight…. George Davis is not on his own any more thanks to people like you. There are more things twixt life and death than a pound note.&quot;

Some of UPAL&#x27;s core activists, involved with both the Davis and Ince Campaigns, had also had late &#x27;60s early &#x27;70s activist connections with the &quot;Release Collective&quot;.

==Release ==
In May 1976, despite a then-recent Court of Appeal decision (11 December 1975) not to overturn Davis&#x27;s criminal conviction, the Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, on partial completion of a police review of the case, agreed to recommend the release of Davis without further referral back to the Court of Appeal. Jenkins undertook this highly exceptional exercise of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy because of doubts over the evidence presented by the police which helped convict Davis. Davis&#x27;s release was announced on 11 May 1976.

At the time of Davis&#x27;s release, former Home Office Minister Alex Lyon wrote at some length to explain the genuine difficulties he had faced in seeking to resolve the constitutional difficulties he saw as preventing Davis&#x27;s release from a conviction that he had regarded as unsafe.

According to a BBC Radio 4 documentary, although Davis was released because his conviction was deemed to be &quot;unsafe&quot; by the Home Secretary he extraordinarily held that Davis was not held to be &quot;innocent&quot;. The period of official embargo on the release to the Public Record Office of official papers, related to the 1976 decision to free Davis, has now been extended by 20 years until 2026.

However, according to a report in &quot;The Independent&quot; written by the newspaper&#x27;s Law Editor, Robert Verkaik, Davis and one of his original trial barristers, David Whitehouse, later a QC, intended to make representations to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in the hope that they would return to court citing new evidence and establish Davis&#x27;s innocence and seek compensation for his period of imprisonment. The appeal was heard &quot;explicitly on the basis that (Davis) has no expectation of compensation or other recognition. His reputation is, clearly, that of an armed robber whatever the result&quot;.

On 24 May 2011, Davis&#x27;s conviction for the 1974 raid on the London Electricity Board was quashed by three judges at the Court of Appeal. One of the judges, Lord Justice Hughes, said that the conviction, based on dubious identification evidence, was unsafe but that the court was not able positively to exonerate Davis.

==Further robberies==
In 1978, two years after his release from prison, Davis was jailed again, having pleaded guilty to involvement in an armed bank raid on 23 September 1977 at the Bank of Cyprus, Seven Sisters Road, London. Davis was caught at the wheel of the getaway van with weapons beside him; in the raid shots were fired and a security guard clubbed to the ground. He was released early in 1984 but jailed again in 1987 for attempting to steal mailbags. Davis pleaded guilty.

==Personal life==
Some time after his release from prison in 1976, Davis separated from his first wife Rose. Some years later he married Jennifer, the daughter of a North London police Chief Inspector.

His first wife, Rose Dean-Davis (d. 31 January 2009), wrote a book, &quot;The Wars of Rosie: Hard Knocks, Endurance and the &#x27;George Davis Is Innocent&#x27; Campaign&quot; in 2008.

<text>Exceller (May 12, 1973 – April 7, 1997) is widely considered one of the best horses to race in the United States not to win a year-end championship. Despite his exemplary achievements as a racehorse, and his unique accomplishment in being the only horse to ever defeat two U.S. Triple Crown winners in the same race (and only the second ever to do so in his career), Exceller is now remembered more for the tragic manner of his death and the horse rescue movement it helped inspire.

==Background==
Exceller was foaled on May 12, 1973 in Kentucky. Bred by Mrs. Charles W. Engelhard, he was sold as a yearling for approximately $27,000 to Nelson Bunker Hunt. Hunt&#x27;s advisors figured that a son of European champion stayer Vaguely Noble with long and upright pasterns, would be better suited to European racing and sent him to France.

==European racing career==
Trained at first by François Mathet, who had been the trainer for François Dupré, and later by Maurice Zilber, Exceller didn&#x27;t accomplish much racing as a two-year-old but blossomed as the distances got longer during his three-year-old season. While stablemates Empery and Youth were taking down the French and English Derbys, Exceller won in the grueling Prix Royal-Oak (run at 1 7/8 mile) and the Group 1 Grand Prix de Paris. Shipped to England at age four, he wound up a half-length behind The Minstrel and Orange Bay in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and won the Coronation Cup. Sent to Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Canada, Exceller won the Canadian International.

==American racing career==
In the middle of 1977, Exceller was shipped to California and placed in the care of Charlie Whittingham. At first, Whittingham didn&#x27;t have high expectations for a horse who walked stiffly on arrival and seemed the worse for wear. However, a little time off and some of Whittingham&#x27;s expertise soon had Exceller competing and winning against some of the best horses in America.

As a five-year-old in 1978, Exceller had his best season on the racecourse, winning 7 of 10 starts, all in top company, on both dirt and turf racetracks. After claiming the Hollywood Gold Cup, Hollywood Invitational Turf Handicap, San Juan Capistrano Handicap, Sunset Handicap, and Oak Tree Invitational Stakes, Exceller had his crowning moment. With Bill Shoemaker in the saddle, he came from 22 lengths back to beat Triple Crown winners Seattle Slew and Affirmed in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Affirmed&#x27;s saddle had slipped, effectively taking him out of the race, and Seattle Slew had hung up almost suicidal fractions on the lead, but Exceller still powered through the Belmont Park mud to win by a nose.

Exceller came back again at age six and managed some placings, but was not quite the same horse.

In sum, he had won 15 of 33 starts, including 13 stakes races, and placed in 11 more in France, England, Canada, and the United States and had earned $1,654,003. He and Noor were the only horses in history to defeat two U.S. Triple Crown winners, and Exceller was the only one to pull off this feat in a single race. Most racing writers agree that, along with Gallant Man and Lure, he may have been the best horse to race in the United States and not win a year-end championship.

Exceller ran best, like many European horses, &quot;covered up&quot;—deep in the pack early. In the late stages of the race he produced a powerful burst of speed and caught the leaders in the stretch. His final quarter mile times are notable because he regularly sprinted this distance in under 25 seconds. His fractions of 23 2/5 seconds at the end of the Hollywood Gold Cup and Oak Tree Invitational is very fast, as 23 seconds is considered a quick first quarter in such a race.

==Stud career==
Exceller was syndicated and retired to stud at Gainesway Farm in Lexington, Kentucky for the 1980 breeding season. He shared a small stallion barn with his sire Vaguely Noble and classic-winning champion stablemate, Youth. In 1986 (and probably before), he stood for a $50,000 stud fee, the second-highest listed fee at Gainesway at the time.

As time went on, however, it became obvious that Exceller was never going to be a leading sire. By 1991, his stud fee had plummeted to $2,500.

==Death==
In 1991, the syndicate was bought out by a breeder from Sweden and Exceller was shipped back across the Atlantic Ocean. He sired a few crops of foals, then was diagnosed with a mysterious infection that forced his removal from stud service for several years. When Exceller&#x27;s owner went bankrupt, the horse was moved to a small farm where he remained for a year before owner Göte Östlund ordered him killed. He was taken to a slaughterhouse and killed for meat on April 7, 1997. According to the woman who tended him- and whose duty it became to kill him- and the Scandinavian Racing Bureau, he wasn&#x27;t destroyed due to illness or injury, but because he became a liability to his bankrupt owner Göte Östlund.

==Legacy==
Exceller left behind 16 crops of foals in the United States, including 19 stakes winners and 40 stakes horses, none of them of his quality. His runners were headed by the fillies Slew&#x27;s Exceller and Squan Song.

Exceller was elected to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1999. Although the museum&#x27;s website mentions the manner of his death, his plaque in the museum does not, stating only that he died in 1997. His fate, essentially unheard of for an American stallion of his racing class, generated debate over the proper treatment of race horses after their careers on the track were over.

Today, a number of grassroots organizations, such as The Exceller Fund, ReRun, The Communication Alliance to Network Thoroughbred Ex-Racehorses (CANTER), and Old Friends, among others, take inspiration from Exceller&#x27;s story as they work to purchase and retrain former racehorses for new careers. In addition, had the horse been in the United States, he may well have been given a proper home at the Kentucky Horse Park&#x27;s Hall of Champions in Lexington as was done after the retired champion thoroughbred Cigar was found to be infertile at stud. Or, the owner might have been able to have handed him over to the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation in Shrewsbury, New Jersey, the world&#x27;s largest and most respected organization devoted to equine rescue.

Like Exceller, Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand ended up in a slaughterhouse in Japan in 2002.

In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Exceller was ranked #96.

<text>The Marcel Benoist Prize, offered by the Marcel Benoist Foundation, is a monetary prize that has been offered annually since 1920 to a scientist of Swiss nationality or residency who has made the most useful scientific discovery. Emphasis is placed on those discoveries affecting human life. Since 1997, candidates in the humanities have also been eligible for the prize.

The Marcel Benoist Foundation was established by the will of the French lawyer Marcel Benoist, a wartime resident of Lausanne, who died in 1918. It is managed by a group of trustees comprising the Swiss interior minister and heads of the main Swiss universities. It has been dubbed the &quot;Swiss Nobel Prize.&quot;
== History ==

The first award was given to immunologist Maurice Arthus (1862–1945) at the University of Lausanne. Other winners have included computer scientist Niklaus Wirth, astronomer Michel Mayor, and cardiologist Max Holzmann. , eleven Marcel Benoist winners have later also won the Nobel Prize: Paul Karrer, Leopold Ruzicka, Walter R. Hess, Tadeus Reichstein, Vladimir Prelog, Niels Kaj Jerne, Johannes G. Bednorz, Karl. Alexander Müller, Richard R. Ernst, Kurz Wüthrich, and Michel Mayor.

In 2009, Françoise Gisou van der Goot (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) was the first woman to win the Marcel Benoist Prize.

<text>Fabian Núñez (also transcribed variously as Fabián Núñez, Fabian Nuñez and Fabian Nunez; born December 27, 1966) is an American politician and labor union adviser. A member of the Democratic Party, he served three two-year terms as a member of the California State Assembly, leaving office in late 2008. During his last two terms, Núñez served as the 66th Speaker of the California State Assembly.

==Early life==
Fabian Núñez is the tenth of twelve children. He was born in San Diego, California, to Mexican parents, but the family lived in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico until Núñez was 7 years old. He spent the rest of his youth in the Logan Heights neighborhood of San Diego. His parents eventually became United States citizens. At the age of 31, Núñez earned Bachelor of Arts degrees in both political science and education from Pitzer College in Claremont, California.

From 1996 to 2000, Fabian Núñez served as the Political Director for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor and, between 2000 and 2002, was the Government Affairs Director for the Los Angeles Unified School District.

==California State Assembly==
Núñez was elected to the California State Assembly to represent the 46th district in 2002. Later, on February 9, 2004 he was selected as the Speaker of the California Assembly.

When Núñez was elected, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that he promised to &quot;foster a spirit of bipartisanship in the Assembly ...&quot; He was quoted saying, &quot;We should reestablish this great legislative body as the house of ideas. And more importantly, we must work together for the benefit of all Californians.&quot; During his tenure as speaker, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; editorialized that the 2005/2006 &quot;legislative session represented one of the most productive in recent memory.&quot;

Throughout his term, Núñez authored several laws including a $1.25 increase in the minimum wage, and a measure to promote competition among cable television providers.

In August 2005, Núñez traveled to Mexico to meet with then-president of Mexico, Vicente Fox, other high level government officials, and business leaders. The declared purpose of his journey was to strengthen ties between Mexico and California that he claimed had deteriorated under California&#x27;s governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger. At Núñez&#x27;s invitation, president Fox eventually traveled to Sacramento and addressed a special joint session of the California State Legislature.

Núñez supported and advocated for the passage of the 2006 infrastructure bonds. He authored both the education (Proposition 1B) and water levee bond (Proposition 1D) in the Legislature. Former Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg spoke about Núñez&#x27; involvement with the passage of the bonds on May 17, 2006: &quot;And ultimately credit goes to Speaker Fabian Núñez, who is a very keen legislator who understands how to put the pieces and parts together and see the big picture. He was instrumental in taking what was failure last time and putting it all together this time. Fabian is willing to work with all sides and wants to get things done.&quot;

Núñez passed a law in 2006 to establish a program to provide prescription drugs at discount prices to about five million uninsured and underinsured Californians. The new law will require the state department of Health Services to negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers. In 2006, he also authored AB 32, which was signed into law by Schwarzenegger. AB 32 created the nation&#x27;s first cap on greenhouse gas emissions. The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities, refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere.

In 2007, Núñez was named &quot;Public Official of the Year&quot; by &quot;Governing Magazine&quot;. The magazine highlighted his legislative leadership and accomplishments:

Fabian Núñez doesn&#x27;t think compromise is a dirty word. California&#x27;s Assembly speaker has played a classic legislative leadership role as the bridge between Republican governor and a strongly liberal majority Democratic caucus, helping to forge and shepherd through a long list of impressive legislation over the past couple of years.His personal scorecard includes a $40 billion infrastructure bond package, a $7 billion prison building and rehabilitation measure, and a landmark global-warming law that is already being imitated by other states. &quot;Some people feel you can&#x27;t compromise because you&#x27;re setting your values aside,&quot; he continues. &quot;I believe the opposite. You&#x27;re fighting for your beliefs when you can move the ball forward.&quot;

On October 10, 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Núñez had allegedly spent tens of thousands of dollars of campaign money for personal expenses. However, October 27, 2009, Political Blotter reported that the FPPC had cleared Núñez of all accusations.

Due to term limits, Núñez had to retire from the Assembly after 2008. Starting in fall 2007, he actively campaigned in support of a statewide proposition to amend the term limits law, including being made eligible to serve an additional six years as speaker. This ballot measure, California Proposition 93 (2008), was widely seen as a power grab on the part of Núñez and Senate Majority Leader Don Perata. On February 5, 2008 election, a majority of California voters rejected Proposition 93. Núñez was succeeded by Karen Bass.

After serving as speaker of the Assembly, Núñez was named as co-chair of the Hillary Clinton 2008 presidential bid. He joined a national bipartisan public strategy firm, Mercury, as a partner managing the Sacramento and Los Angeles offices. Núñez also serves on the Board of Directors for the U.S Soccer Federation and previously serviced on the University of California Board of Regents.

In October 2008, Núñez&#x27;s son Esteban and his friends provoked a fight where Luis Santos was murdered. Esteban admitted to stabbing two other students. In May 2010, Esteban entered into a plea agreement in which he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 16 years in prison for the death of Santos.
Núñez was a close friend and key political ally of then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.

When Esteban Núñez was first arrested, his father used his influence to get him more favorable conditions. Letters pleading for a reduction in his son&#x27;s $2-million bail were sent to the San Diego County Superior Court. One letter, on official stationery, came from Núñez&#x27;s longtime friend, then Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa; one letter came on official stationery from Maria Elena Durazo, head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor; one came from California Assembly Republican Leader Michael Villines; and one was sent by California State Assemblyman Kevin de León. His bail was reduced to $1 million.

Just hours before he left office, Schwarzenegger commuted Esteban Núñez&#x27;s sentence to seven years. The commutation, along with Schwarzenegger&#x27;s failure to notify the family of the victim, outraged them who then tried to sue to stop the commutation but were unsuccessful. Subsequently, Schwarzenegger&#x27;s successor Jerry Brown signed a bipartisan bill in 2011 requiring victims and their families to be given at least 10 days notice before prison sentence commutations. In April 2016, Esteban Núñez was released from Mule Creek State Prison after serving less than six years.

In 2010, Núñez filed paperwork to run for the California State Senate but withdrew. Núñez created a campaign finance committee and announced that he would run for California State Treasurer in 2014, when incumbent Bill Lockyer was termed out. Núñez formed an exploratory committee for California State Treasurer in 2018.

Núñez is currently a partner at the public relations and lobbying firm Actum.

<doc id="578528" wikidata="Q15196918" url="?curid=578528" title="Nickernut">
<text>Nickernuts or nickar nuts are smooth, shiny seeds from tropical leguminous shrubs, particularly &quot;Guilandina bonduc&quot; and &quot;Guilandina major&quot;, both known by the common name warri tree. &quot;C. bonduc&quot; produces gray nickernuts, and &quot;C. major&quot; produces yellow. Accordingly, these species are locally known in the Caribbean as &quot;grey nickers&quot; and &quot;yellow nickers&quot;.

The word &quot;nicker&quot; probably derives from the Dutch word &quot;knikker&quot;, meaning marble.

In the Caribbean, nickernuts are used to play mancala games such as oware. The nickernut is marble-like and good for other uses, such as for jewellery; it is also sometimes ground up to make a medicinal tea.

The seeds are often found on the beach, and are also known as sea pearls or eaglestones.

&quot;Guilandina&quot; and &quot;Merremia&quot; seeds sometimes drift long distances. In 1693 James Wallace referred to them being often found in Orkney: &quot;After Storms of Westerly Wind amongst the Sea-weed, they find commonly in places expos&#x27;d to the Western-Ocean these Phaseoli . . . . [F]rom the West-Indies, where they commonly grow, they may be thrown in on Ireland, the Western parts of Scotland and Orkney&quot;. In 1751 Erich Pontoppidan described one found on the coast of Norway: &quot;It is of the size of a chestnut, orbicular, yet flat, or as it were compressed on both sides. Its colour is a dark brown yet in the middle, at the junction of the shells, it is varied with a circle of shining-black, and close by that another of a lively red, which have a very pretty effect&quot;. They were known as &#x27;sea beans&#x27; in Scandinavia, where one has been found fossilised in a Swedish bog, and &#x27;Molucca beans&#x27; in the Hebrides, where a visitor to Islay in 1772 wrote of them as seeds of &quot;&quot;Dolichos wrens&quot;, &quot;Guilandina bonduc&quot;, &quot;G. bonducetta&quot;, and &quot;Mimosa scandens&quot;…natives of &quot;Jamaica&quot;&quot;. The 1797 Edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; said that they were used only for &quot;the making of snuff-boxes out of them&quot;; however, there is a long tradition of using them as amulets for good luck, banishment of ill luck or to ease childbirth.

<text>The Indian River is a river in Lanark County in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Saint Lawrence River drainage basin and is a left tributary of the Mississippi River.

==Course==
The river begins at an unnamed lake in geographic Lavant Township in the municipality of Lanark Highlands. It flows east into geographic Darling Township, under Lanark County Road 511 near the settlement of White, turns southeast, passes the settlement of Halls Mills on the border of geographic Lanark Township, and reaches Clayton Lake, where it takes in the outflow from Taylor Lake. The river passes into geographic Ramsay Township in the municipality of Mississippi Mills on the lake, and leaves over the Clayton Lake Dam at the settlement of Clayton. It heads northeast, takes in the right tributary Union Hall Creek, and passes through the Mill of Kintail Conservation Area, which has a former grist mill, and a former home of medical doctor, sculptor and Ramsay Township native R. Tait McKenzie. The mill is home to a museum to Mackenzie and to another famous native of Ramsay Township, inventor of basketball James Naismith. The river then reaches its mouth at the Mississippi River, upstream of the settlement of Blakeney; the Mississippi flows via the Ottawa River to the Saint Lawerence River.

<text>Church Street is a main north-south running street in the city of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. It contains many of Wollongong&#x27;s well known and lesser known attractions and historic sites.

To the north it runs from the northern high rise district west of the harbour through apartments and flats and then down Smith&#x27;s Hill, up Church Hill and down to Wollongong Central. At the summit of Church Hill is the site of St Michael&#x27;s Anglican Pro-Cathedral.

At the mall a portion runs for pedestrian only use (though this is currently up for debate as to whether cars should be let back in limited amounts and times on Crown Street, the street running through the mall east-west) and then turns back to traffic along a section of light density commerce and residence for just over a kilometre. For the first half of this there is a long car park within the street, used often by mall shoppers and people watching games at local WIN Stadium a few blocks to the east, due to no cost parking. On the west side of this section is McCabe Park (often mis-spelt McCabe), a local park with a playground and youth centre. South of this the street goes through residential areas to the immediate southern suburb of where it ends at J.J. Kelly Park, a local sporting venue, also used on occasion by circuses for tent sites.

==Historic sites and history==
The street was created in the early 19th century, and contained a bottle factory and many houses. There are two historic churches on Church Hill, and many houses on the southern part of the street are over seventy years old. The old Wollongong Court House sits on the east side of the hill square, and is known for its clock tower. It was renovated in 2006.

<doc id="578531" wikidata="Q3516661" url="?curid=578531" title="Te Puea Hērangi">
<text>Te Puea Hērangi (9 November 1883 – 12 October 1952), known by the name Princess Te Puea, was a Māori leader from New Zealand&#x27;s Waikato region. Her mother, Tiahuia, was the elder sister of King Mahuta.

==Early life==
She was born at Whatiwhatihoe, near Pirongia, in the Waikato, daughter of Te Tahuna Hērangi and Tiahuia. Te Tahuna Hērangi was the son of William Nicholas Searancke, an English surveyor. Tiahuia was daughter of the second Māori king, Tāwhiao Te Wherowhero, by his principal wife.

As the eventual successor to her grandfather, she was educated in the traditional Māori ways. At age 12 she began attending Mercer Primary School and then went on to attend Mangere Bridge School and Melmerly College in Parnell. She was fluent in speaking and writing Māori and she could speak English, but her written English was very poor. She married Rāwiri Tūmōkai Kātipa in 1922. She was unable to have children.

In her twenties, Te Puea settled at Mangatāwhiri and began dairy farming. She began collecting and recording waiata (songs), whakapapa (genealogies) and kōrero tawhito (history) from her extended family.

==Leadership role==
When her mother died in 1898, Te Puea returned home reluctantly at the age of 15, supposedly to take her mother&#x27;s place. However, being young and believing also that she was dying of tuberculosis, she rejected the traditional role expected of her and cut herself off from her people.

This phase passed and in 1911 she returned to her people and resumed her hereditary role. Her first task, the one that re-established her mana among her people, was to successfully campaign on behalf of Māui Pōmare in his election bid to become the Kingite Member of Parliament. Te Puea later fell out with Pōmare because he supported Māori soldiers fighting for New Zealand overseas. Te Puea worked against this behind Pōmare&#x27;s back. He became aware of her attitude and in the winter of 1918 attended an anti-conscription hui called by Te Puea where he was roundly abused by all the elders of the Kīngitanga. Te Puea&#x27;s support base was mainly with the lower Waikato tribes initially – she was a minor figure for up-river iwi such as Maniapoto.

Because of Waikato&#x27;s anti-government stance on conscription during WW1 and Te Puea&#x27;s personal involvement in hiding conscripts, she was not a popular figure with government or local Pākehā after WW1. After WW1, farmers were reluctant to offer Kingites work and during the Royal visit of the Prince of Wales the Kingites&#x27; desire to host the prince was snubbed in favour of an Arawa visit that was open to all Māori to attend. Arawa had been selected as they had the experience and facilities to host a large Māori occasion. They were an iwi that had remained loyal to the government, taking an active part against the Kingites in the land wars and playing a full role in WW1.

==Achievements==
She was soon acknowledged as one of the leaders of the Kīngitanga Movement and worked to make it part of the central focus of the Māori people. She also began farming at Mangatāwhiri. Te Puea was firmly opposed to conscription when it was introduced in 1917 and provided a refuge at her farm for those who refused to be conscripted into the New Zealand Army.

Following the influenza epidemic of 1918, she took under her wing some 100 orphans, who were the founding members of the community of Tūrangawaewae at Ngāruawāhia. It was through Tūrangawaewae that Te Puea began to extend her influence beyond the Waikato Region. The construction of its carved meeting house was strongly supported by Sir Āpirana Ngata and the Ngāti Porou people. She became friendly with the Prime Minister, Gordon Coates who was raised in a rural community where many Māori lived, and with journalist Eric Ramsden who publicised her tours and the development of the Kīngitanga base at Tūrangawaewae. Coates was keen to lift Waikato Māori out of their sullen depression by addressing land grievances. Coates had been shocked at the conditions in which Waikato Māori lived-calling them the poorest people he had seen in his life. It was through her friendship with Ramsden that articles about her and her work began to appear in the national newspapers. In these she was usually identified as Princess Te Puea, a title that she herself deplored, saying that the role of princess does not exist in Māoritanga. Pōmare pointed out that neither does King.

During 1913 and 1914 the Māori community suffered a smallpox epidemic. The main problem was that many of them believed that disease was a punishment from displeased spirits, and refused to go to Pākehā hospitals. In response, Te Puea set up a small settlement of nīkau huts devoted to nursing people back to health. This was successful as not one person died and the isolation of the village largely prevented spread of disease. 

Te Puea&#x27;s main drive was to establish Tūrangawaewae as a base for the Kīngitanga but she was always short of funds. In 1922 she decided to raise money for her ambitious building programme by starting a Māori concert party called Te Pou o Mangawhiri . Choosing this name (the place where General Cameron crossed into rebel held territory in 1863) she hoped to remind the Pākehā of the war and the confiscations. TPM, as it was known, travelled around New Zealand performing haka, poi dances, Hawaiian hula dances, with steel guitars, mandolins, banjos and ukuleles. In a three-month tour the group saved 900 pounds which was used to build a new kitchen dining room. Te Puea restarted the Kīngitanga taxation scheme whereby all Kīngitanga supporters were required to pay levies to support Kīngatanga programmes. This was commonly called the whitebait levy. At other times Te Puea levied every supporter for an additional donation of 2s 6d. Te Puea was known to keep meticulous records of these finances.

===Tour of the East Coast and controversy over gifted farm===
During her tour of the East Coast in the late 1930s Te Puea visited Ngāti Porou marae where, to her surprise, she was accepted, despite her links to the King movement which Ngāti Porou had always despised for its isolation and backwardness. For her part Te Puea was surprised at the affluence that Ngāti Porou enjoyed as well as their acceptance of European lifestyle. The East coast tour was a great success and raised more money for Tūrangawaewae buildings. Following this she was invited to Wellington to take part in a wide range of official and social arrangements. Te Puea used the contacts she had made, especially with Māori MP and minister Āpirana Ngata to further her development of the Kīngitanga base. She was able to acquire from the government a block of land near the meeting house for growing vegetables, increased pensions and a local post box. The Prime Minister Gordon Coates also gave her a 200-acre farm, built her a house and made a gift of £1,000 for farm development; and also subsidised a Māori workers&#x27; hostel in Tuakau. Coates said this was given in recognition of her work for Waikato orphans and the poor but also to consolidate her political support at a time when the Rātana church was becoming a major and threatening political force. Ngata gave Te Puea government loans and another 300-acre block to grow food to support the Kīngitanga. This farm needed a developer and an experienced Pākehā farmer paid for by the government was appointed supervisor. Ngata fired him and replaced him with Te Puea. She was given a car so she could move around the three farms. Her husband was given another farm at Tikitere in Rotorua. However concerns were raised in Parliament about how Ngata was operating and misusing government funds in 1934. This led to an investigation held by a Royal Commission that found there had been a host of irregularities involving the expenditure of £500,000. Labour MP Bob Semple said that the commission revealed one of the worst specimens of abuse of political power, maladministration and misappropriation of public funds. Ngata resigned.

In 1935, she was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.

Te Puea was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for social welfare services, in the 1937 Coronation Honours. Initially she was confused and reluctant to accept the award because of her dealings with the government. The CBE was awarded for her self-sacrificing devotion and stupendous personal efforts and extraordinary capacity for leadership and organisation, with a talent for diplomacy in her dealings with other tribes and leaders amongst the Pakeha... she turned idle lands into productive excellent farms. A year later another carved meeting house was opened by the Governor General, Lord Galway.

===1940s===
In 1940 she bought a farm near Ngāruawāhia and began developing it provide an economic base for the Tūrangawaewae community. It was there that she began teaching the beliefs that would sustain the King Movement: work, faith (specifically the Pai Mārire faith, which became strongly established in the Waikato region), and pan-Māori unity through the King Movement. Te Puea always stressed the importance of iwi over hapū (the tribe over the sub-tribe or family grouping).

The Government planned nationwide celebrations for the centenary in 1940 of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, the document that founded modern New Zealand. Initially Te Puea was in favour, but then withdrew her support when the government refused her request that the Māori king be given the same tax status as the governor-general. At the time she said:
==Reconciliation with Pākehā==
Te Puea was raised by people who had fought war to resist the government invasion of the Waikato in 1863, and by people who had lived through the bitter years that followed. She had little reason to love or trust Pākehā. However, as time went by she came to see the need for reconciliation. In 1946 Te Puea approached the government to say the tribe would be willing to accept money to compensate for the loss of lands after the defeat of the Kīngitanga in 1863. A large meeting was held at Tūrangawaewae in which a wide range of opinions were aired. Then the leadership met privately with Prime Minister Peter Fraser and worked out what would be accepted by the tribe. A deal had already been settled with Taranaki tribes and Waikato were keen to do better. The final deal gave Waikato nearly twice the income of Taranaki. The deal was accepted by Roore Edwards at the urging of Te Puea. After nearly 20 years of negotiation she accepted, on behalf of Tainui, a settlement offered by the Prime Minister of an initial grant of 10,000 pounds and 5,000 pounds (later $15,000) a year spread over 40 years. No provision was made for inflation which at that time was very low. By the time the deal was presented to the tribe the next day the money had been increased again to 6,000 pounds for 50 years and thereafter 5,000 pounds in perpetuity. She recognised this as an acceptable offer. However the payment acknowledged that a grievous wrong had been done to her people. Te Puea also built Tūrangawaewae marae and has a statue of her in front of the house called Mahinārangi.

==Later life==
In the last few years of her life, Te Puea fell out with many of the Māori and Pākehā friends who had worked with her for most of her adult life. She became increasingly demanding and unreasonable when she did not get her way. Te Puea died at her home after a long illness. During her lifetime, she had raised the profile of the King Movement, especially outside of Waikato, and had helped raise the standard of living of Waikato to that of other Māori.
In December 1947, Te Puea became a member of a trust that administered a Māori land reserve in Māngere Bridge, Auckland. The land had been settled in the 19th century by her Ngāti Mahuta relatives, including Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, prior to his becoming the first Māori King, and Kati Takiwaru. Confiscated prior to the invasion of the Waikato, a section of the land was returned by the Native Land Court to Ngāti Mahuta individuals, including Te Puea&#x27;s mother, Tiahuia, in 1890. Before her death, Te Puea expressed a wish for a marae to be built at the site, and in 1965 the Te Puea Memorial Marae was opened, named after her to acknowledge her contributions to the people of Aotearoa.

In 1998, Te Puea was posthumously inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame.

==Biography by Michael King==
In 1974 the historian Michael King, who had worked for the &quot;Waikato Times&quot; and learnt te reo Māori, became interested in writing about Te Puea. He discovered there was very little written about her and wanted to write about her while the people who knew her at first hand, were still alive. King tried to persuade the Māori author Pei te Hurinui Jones, to write the biography but he refused, saying he knew too much about her. Jones said it would be difficult to write about Te Puea without damaging her reputation (mana). After discussions with the tribe and Dame Te Atairangikaahu it was agreed that King would write her biography. He was given restricted access to many of Te Puea&#x27;s papers by Alex McKay, formerly Te Puea&#x27;s secretary. McKay said he could not have all the papers as there was too much private and family information that should remain confidential. Many of Te Puea&#x27;s elderly friends gave valuable time to King. Within a few years nearly all were dead. After the book was published some non-Waikato/Tainui Māori criticised them for allowing a Pākehā to write about a highly tapu person.

<text>Fairy Meadow is a suburb in the City of Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Located in the Illawarra region and only 4 km from the city centre, it is a mainly low-density residential area, with a large strip of commercial and industrial properties along and off the Princes Highway.

==Overview==
Fairy Meadow is popular with tourists and surfers, due to its long beach (Fairy Meadow Beach) and views of Mount Keira, and Mount Kembla. Fairy Meadow residents live mainly in older-style houses, though apartments are now being built along the aforementioned strip. The main shopping area includes Coles, Woolworths and Aldi supermarkets and many smaller stores and boutiques.

A local historical building is the old Northern Illawarra Council Chambers.

To the southeast of Fairy Meadow in North Wollongong is Puckeys Estate Reserve, a bush reserve known for bird watching and coastal environment protection, open to the public for walking on the tracks, once the site of a saltworks. The area is also bordered by a long beach which stretches from Towradgi Point in the north, to Wollongong in the south, interrupted only by the rocks at the Fairy Lagoon entrance.

North of Puckey&#x27;s Reserve and east of Fairy Meadow is Fairy Meadow Beach, the picnic facilities, playground and toilets in 2007 went under upgrades along with several other beachside areas in the Illawarra. The beach is patrolled in summer and has a surf life saving club, established in 1951.

West of Puckey&#x27;s Reserve is Brandon Park, a greyhound racing track and the Wollongong Science Centre and Planetarium complex as well as an area of university property. The science centre is known for its laser concerts. The science centre was opened on 15 May 2000 by MP Colin Markham. The centre building is overtly white and clearly visible from Wollongong&#x27;s higher points. Outside the entrance there stands a sculpture called &#x27;Southern Cross&#x27;, featuring poles in the shape of the constellation with graphics on them. The science and planetarium centre contains two levels, including a laser theatre, observatory, dinosaur and fossil exhibit, electronics exhibit and other attractions such as a setup demonstrating solar power with a model railroad and a forest logging simulation game

<doc id="578536" wikidata="Q5248529" url="?curid=578536" title="Debra Wong Yang">
<text>Debra Wong Yang (; pinyin: Yáng Huáng Jīnyù) is the former United States Attorney for the Central District of California. She was appointed in May 2002 by President George W. Bush, who made her the first Asian American woman to serve as a United States Attorney. In 2009, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa nominated Yang to a vacancy on the Los Angeles Police Commission. In 2016, she was listed as the potential choice for SEC Chief in Donald Trump&#x27;s cabinet.

== Education ==
In 1981, Yang received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Pitzer College and in 1985, a Juris Doctor from Boston College Law School

==Career==

Yang served as President of the Chinese American Museum in Los Angeles, where she played an instrumental role in the creation of this new landmark for Southern California. Yang was a founding member and officer of the first Asian American Bar Association in Chicago, and she has been an officer and board member of the Southern California Chinese Lawyer Association.

In 2002, the Los Angeles City Council honored her for her long-standing commitment to victims&#x27; rights. The Asian Pacific Bar Association selected her as the 2002 recipient of their Public Service Award. The National Asian Pacific American Bar Association selected her as the 2003 recipient of the Trailblazer Award. In 2004, she was appointed to the President&#x27;s Council of Pitzer College of the Claremont Colleges, received Pitzer College&#x27;s inaugural Distinguished Alumni Award, and was recognized by the Inglewood Court as a champion of civil rights.

Yang has been an adjunct professor at the USC Gould School of Law, where she taught trial advocacy. She has also been an instructor at the National Institute of Trial Advocacy and an instructor at California&#x27;s Judicial College.

===California state judge===

Yang was a California state judge. She was appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1997 and became a member of the Los Angeles Superior Court bench in 2000. As a judge, Yang acted as the Supervising Judge for the Hollywood Courthouse. She sat on the Criminal Law Advisory Committee and the Subcommittee on the Quality of Judicial Service for the Court&#x27;s Judicial Council.

===United States Attorney===
Yang led the largest United States Attorney&#x27;s Office outside of Washington, D.C. The office serves the approximately 18 million people who live in Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, Ventura County, Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County, California. 

Yang served as an Assistant United States Attorney for approximately seven years prior to her judicial career. As a federal prosecutor, she handled violent crimes, white-collar crimes, international money laundering, arson and computer crimes. As an Assistant United States Attorney, Yang successfully prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including a Glendale arson investigator convicted of setting fires throughout the state of California; the first federal carjacking case in California; the kidnapping of a local real estate agent; and a computer hacker who received what was then the longest prison sentence for computer intrusion. 
Yang resigned her position as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California on November 11, 2006, to join Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has raised questions about Yang&#x27;s departure in light of the subsequent firing of seven US Attorneys. Yang&#x27;s office had opened an investigation into the relationship between Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-CA) and a lobbyist five months before she left to join the law firm that represented Rep. Lewis. Yang has denied that any pressure was put on her to resign.

===Los Angeles Police Commission===
On August 13, 2009, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa nominated Yang to a vacancy on the Los Angeles Police Commission. She will have a role in guiding the department past the end of the post-Rampart scandal consent decree and in selecting a new police chief to replace outgoing Chief William Bratton. Villaraigosa cited her &quot;extensive law enforcement credentials&quot; in making the selection.

===Private law practice===
After leaving the US Attorney&#x27;s office, Yang became a partner at Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher’s Los Angeles office, becoming Co-Chair of the firm&#x27;s Crisis Management Practice Group and the White Collar Defense and Investigations Practice Group.

<doc id="578538" wikidata="Q370513" url="?curid=578538" title="Robert Hass">
<text>Robert L. Hass (born March 1, 1941) is an American poet. He served as Poet Laureate of the United States from 1995 to 1997. He won the 2007 National Book Award and shared the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for the collection &quot;Time and Materials: Poems 1997–2005.&quot; In 2014 he was awarded the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets.

==Life==
Hass&#x27;s works are well known for their West Coast subjects and attitudes. He was born in San Francisco and grew up in San Rafael. He grew up with an alcoholic mother, a major topic in the 1996 poem collection &quot;Sun Under Wood&quot;. His older brother encouraged him to dedicate himself to his writing. Awestruck by Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg, among others in the 1950s Bay Area poetry scene, Hass entertained the idea of becoming a beatnik. He graduated from Marin Catholic High School in 1958. When the area became influenced by East Asian literary techniques, such as haiku, Hass took many of these influences up in his poetry. He has been hailed as &quot;a lyrical virtuoso who is able to turn even cooking recipes into poetry&quot;.

Hass is married to the poet and antiwar activist Brenda Hillman, who is a professor at Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California.

==Career==
Hass graduated from Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Moraga, California in 1963, and received his MA and Ph.D. in English from Stanford University in 1965 and 1971 respectively. 

From 1995 to 1997, during Hass&#x27;s two terms as the US Poet Laureate (Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress), he became a champion of literacy, poetry, and ecological awareness. He criss-crossed the country lecturing in places as diverse as corporate boardrooms and for civic groups, or as he has said, &quot;places where poets don&#x27;t go.&quot; After his self-described &quot;act of citizenship,&quot; he wrote a weekly column on poetry in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; until 2000. He serves as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets, was a trustee of the Griffin Poetry Prize (now trustee emeritus), and works actively for literacy and the environment.

As major influences on his poetry, Hass cites Beat poet Lew Welch, and has praised the slogan &quot;Raid Kills Bugs Dead,&quot; which Welch crafted while working for an advertising firm. 

==Poetry==
Hass&#x27;s poems tend to vary in structure as he alternates between prose-like blocks and free verse. His poems have been said to have a stylistic clarity, seen in his simple, clear language and precise imagery. His collection &quot;Praise&quot; features themes of seasons, nature, location, and transformation, with a running motif of blackberries. Poet Stanley Kunitz said of Hass&#x27;s work, &quot;Reading a poem by Robert Hass is like stepping into the ocean when the temperature of the water is not much different from that of the air. You scarcely know, until you feel the undertow tug at you, that you have entered into another element.&quot;

The January 2017 &quot;Gift Horse&quot; episode of the TV series &quot;Madam Secretary&quot; alludes to Hass. At a presidential inauguration, the poet laureate character (&quot;Roland Hobbs&quot;) recites a poem that describes &quot;the privilege of being&quot;, an allusion to Hass&#x27;s 1999 poem of that title.

==Activism==

Hass has been actively engaged in promoting ecoliteracy. In 1995 he began working with writer and environmentalist Pamela Michael on a program that encourages &quot;children to make art and poetry about their watersheds&quot; and fosters interdisciplinary environmental education. In April 1996, when he was poet laureate, he organized a 6-day conference at the Library of Congress that brought together American nature writers to celebrate writing, the natural world and community.

On November 9, 2011, while participating in an Occupy movement demonstration at UC Berkeley called Occupy Cal, a police officer hit Hass in the ribs with a baton.

<text>The cardoon (Cynara cardunculus ), also called the artichoke thistle, is a thistle in the family Asteraceae. It is a naturally occurring species that also has many cultivated forms, including the globe artichoke. It is native to the Mediterranean region, where it was domesticated in ancient times and still occurs as a wild plant.

==Description==
The wild cardoon is a stout herbaceous perennial plant growing tall, with deeply lobed and heavily spined green to grey-green tomentose (hairy or downy) leaves up to long, with yellow spines up to 3.5 cm long. The flowers are violet-purple, produced in a large, globose, massively spined capitulum up to in diameter.

It is adapted to dry climates, native across a circum-Mediterranea area from Morocco and Portugal east to Libya and Greece and north to Croatia and Southern France; it may also be native on Cyprus, the Canary Islands and Madeira. In France, the frost-tender cardoon only occurs wild in the Mediterranean south (Gard, Hérault, Aude, Pyrénées-Orientales, Corsica). It has become an invasive weed in the pampas of Argentina, and is also considered a weed in Australia and California.

The &quot;giant thistle of the Pampas&quot; reported by Charles Darwin has been identified as cardoon.

==Cultivation==

The two main cultivar groups are the cardoon (&quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot; Cardoon Group, syn. &quot;C. cardunculus&quot; var. &quot;altilis&quot; DC), selected for edible leaf stems, and the artichoke (&quot;Cynara cardunculus&quot; Scolymus Group, sometimes distinguished as &quot;Cynara scolymus&quot; or &quot;C. cardunculus&quot; var. &quot;scolymus&quot; (L.) Fiori), selected for larger edible flower buds. They differ from the wild plant in being larger (up to 2 m tall), much less spiny, and with thicker leaf stems and larger flowers, all characteristics selected by humans for greater crop yield and easier harvest and processing. Wild and cultivated cardoons and artichokes are very similar genetically, and are fully interfertile, but have only very limited ability to form hybrids with other species in the genus &quot;Cynara&quot;.

The earliest description of the cardoon may come from the fourth-century BC Greek writer Theophrastus, under the name (), although the exact identity of this plant is uncertain. The cardoon was popular in Greek, Roman, and Persian cuisine, and remained popular in medieval and early modern Europe. It also became common in the vegetable gardens of colonial America, but fell from fashion in the late 19th century and is now very uncommon.

In Europe, cardoon is still cultivated in France (Provence, Savoie, Lyonnais), Spain, and Italy. In the Geneva region, where Huguenot refugees introduced it about 1685, the local cultivar &quot;Argenté de Genève&quot; (&quot;Cardy&quot;) is considered a culinary specialty. &quot;Before cardoons are sent to table, the stalks or ribs are blanched tying them together and wrapping them round with straw, which is also tied up with cord, and left so for about three weeks&quot;. Cardoons also are common vegetables in northern Africa, often used in Algerian or Tunisian &quot;couscous&quot;.

Cardoon stalks can be covered with small, nearly invisible spines that can cause substantial pain if they become lodged in the skin. Several spineless cultivars have been developed to overcome this.

Cardoon requires a long, cool growing season (about five months), and while it is not particularly frost-sensitive, in heavier freezes it may lose its leaves and resprout, or in extended hard freezes, die. It also typically requires substantial growing space per plant, so is not much grown except where it is regionally popular.

In cultivation in the United Kingdom, this plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==As food==
===Nutrition===
Raw cardoon is 94% water, 4% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). A 100 gram reference amount provides 17 calories and moderate amounts (10–19% of the Daily Value) of folate, magnesium, manganese, and sodium (table).

===Culinary===

While the flower buds can be eaten much as small (and spiny) artichokes, more often the stems are eaten after being braised in cooking liquid. Cardoon stems are part of Lyonnaise cuisine (e.g. &quot;gratin de cardons&quot;). Only the innermost, white stalks are considered edible, and cardoons are therefore usually prepared for sale by protecting the leaf stalks from the sunlight for several weeks. This was traditionally done by burying the plant underground, thus, cardoon plantations in Spain are often formed by characteristic earth mounds surrounding each plant, the earth covering the stalks. In modern cultivation, the plant is usually instead wrapped in black plastic film or other opaque material.

The flower buds of wild cardoons are still widely collected and used in southern Italy and Sicily. In Spain and Portugal, the flower buds are also employed in cheesemaking: the pistils of the cardoon flower are used as a vegetable rennet in the making of some cheeses such as the Torta del Casar and the Torta de la Serena cheeses in Spain, or the Queijo de Nisa and Serra da Estrela cheeses in Portugal. Cardoons were also said to have been used by the Romani or &quot;gypsies&quot; and this would make sense as their encampments would often be situated near sources of water. The vegetable was free for the picking, and could account for the widespread use of the plant. That part is speculative.

Cardoon leaf stalks, which look like giant celery stalks, can be served steamed or braised, and have an artichoke-like flavor with a hint of bitterness. They are harvested in winter and spring, being best just before the plant flowers. In the Abruzzo region of Italy, Christmas lunch is traditionally started with a soup of cardoon cooked in chicken broth with little meatballs (lamb or, more rarely, beef), sometimes with the further addition of egg (which scrambles in the hot soup – called &quot;stracciatella&quot;) or fried chopped liver and heart.

The cardoon stalks are considered a delicacy in Spain, particularly in the northerns regions of Navarre and Aragon, where they are grown in large quantities. In Spain, cardoons are typically cooked by first boiling the stalks to soften them, and then adding simple sauces such as almond sauce or small amounts of jamón; they are sometimes combined with clams, artichokes, or beans as well.

Because of their seasonality (from November to February), cardoons are a staple of the Christmas dinner in Navarre and the surrounding regions; for the same reason, cardoons are often sold as vegetable preserves, usually in water or brine, so that they can be eaten all year round. Cardoons are an ingredient in one of the national dishes of Spain, the &quot;cocido madrileño&quot;, a slow-cooking, one-pot, meat and vegetable dish simmered in broth.

In Crete, cardoons are eaten raw, with a drizzle of lemon juice, as a meze, and are considered an excellent accompaniment for raki.

In the US, it is rarely found in conventional grocery stores but is available in supermarkets that cater to largely Italian and European neighborhoods in the mid Atlantic states,
as well as some farmers&#x27; markets in the months of May, June, and July. As suggested above, they become available in the late autumn near Thanksgiving and Christmas. The main root can also be boiled and served cold. The stems are also traditionally served battered and fried at St. Joseph&#x27;s altars in New Orleans. 

Cardoons can also be found in their &quot;wild&quot; state, on the banks of streams and rivers, and even drainage ditches on the sides of roads in rural areas. These plants look little like the cultivated variety found in stores. They have many thin stems with broad broad leaves at their ends. There is a reddish color on the stems, which grow tough, hollow and inedible as they age. The wild ones are picked in the spring and early summer. To use them, the leafy part should be removed, and the stems cleaned of &quot;stringy&quot; fibers.

Cardoon is one of the herbs used to flavour Amaro liqueur, which may be called &quot;Cardamaro&quot;.

==Other uses==
Cardoons are used as a vegetarian source of enzymes for cheese production. In Portugal, traditional coagulation of the curd relies entirely on this vegetable rennet. This results in cheeses such as the Serra da Estrela and Nisa.

The cardoon is also grown as an ornamental plant for its imposing architectural appearance, with very bright silvery-grey foliage and large flowers in selected cultivars.

Cardoon has attracted recent attention as a possible source of biodiesel fuel. The oil, extracted from the seeds of the cardoon, and called artichoke oil, is similar to safflower and sunflower oil in composition and use. Cardoon is the feedstock for the first biorefinery in the world converting the installations of a petrochemical plant in Porto Torres, Sardinia, providing biomass and oils for the building blocks of bioplastics.

<text>The bush dog (Speothos venaticus) is a canine found in Central and South America. In spite of its extensive range, it is very rare in most areas except in Suriname, Guyana and Peru; it was first described by Peter Wilhelm Lund from fossils in Brazilian caves and was believed to be extinct.

The bush dog is the only extant species in the genus &quot;Speothos&quot;, and genetic evidence suggests that its closest living relative is the maned wolf of central South America or the African wild dog. The species is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

In Brazil, it is called (&#x27;vinegar dog&#x27;) and (&#x27;bush dog&#x27;). In Spanish-speaking countries, it is called (&#x27;vinegar dog&#x27;), (&#x27;vinegar fox&#x27;), (&#x27;water dog&#x27;), and (&#x27;shrub or woodland dog&#x27;).

== Description ==
Adult bush dogs have soft long brownish-tan fur, with a lighter reddish tinge on the head, neck and back and a bushy tail, while the underside is dark, sometimes with a lighter throat patch. Younger individuals, however, have black fur over their entire bodies. Adults typically have a head-body length of , with a tail. They have a shoulder height of and weigh . They have short legs relative to their body, as well as a short snout and relatively small ears.

The teeth are adapted for its carnivorous habits. Uniquely for an American canid, the dental formula is for a total of 38 teeth. The bush dog is one of three canid species (the other two being the dhole and the African wild dog) with trenchant heel dentition, having a single cusp on the talonid of the lower carnassial tooth that increases the cutting blade length. Females have four pairs of teats and both sexes have large scent glands on either side of the anus. Bush dogs have partially webbed toes, which allow them to swim more efficiently.

=== Genetics ===
&quot;Speothos&quot; has a diploid chromosome number of 74. This makes it unable to produce fertile hybrids with other canid species.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Bush dogs are found from Costa Rica in Central America and through much of South America east of the Andes, as far south as central Bolivia, Paraguay, and southern Brazil. They primarily inhabit lowland forests up to elevation, wet savannas and other habitats near rivers, but may also be found in drier cerrado and open pasture. The historic range of this species may have extended as far north as Costa Rica where the species may still be found in suitable habitat. New, repeated observations of bush dog groups have been recorded in east-central (Barbilla National Park) and south-eastern (La Amistad International Park) Costa Rica, and a substantial portion of the Talamanca Mountains up to to the north-northwest and at elevations up to . Very recent fossils dating from 300 AD to 900 AD (the Late Ceramic Age) have been found in the Manzanilla site on the eastern coast of Trinidad.

There are three recognised subspecies:
* The South American bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus venaticus&quot;), with a range including southern Colombia and Venezuela, the Guyanas, most of Brazil, eastern Ecuador and Peru, Bolivia, and northern Paraguay.
* The Panamanian bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus panamensis&quot;), with a range including Panama, northern Colombia and Venezuela, western Ecuador.
* The southern bush dog (&quot;Speothos venaticus wingei&quot;), with a range including southern Brazil and Paraguay, as well as extreme northeastern Argentina. The first camera trap photos of this species in Argentina were obtained in April 2016 from the Selva Paranaense Don Otto Ecological Private Reserve, located in Eldorado Department of the Misiones province of Argentina.

== Behavior ==
Bush dogs are carnivores and hunt during the day. Their typical prey are pacas, agoutis, acouchis and capybaras, all large rodents. Although they can hunt alone, bush dogs are usually found in small packs. The dogs can bring down much larger prey, including peccaries and rheas, and a pack of six dogs has even been reported hunting a tapir, where they trailed the animal and nipped at its legs until it was felled. When hunting paca, part of the pack chases it on land and part wait for it in the water, where it often retreats.

Bush dogs appear to be the most gregarious South American canid species. They use hollow logs and cavities such as armadillo burrows for shelter. Packs consist of a single mated pair and their immediate relations, and have a home range of . Only the adult pair breed, while the other members of the pack are subordinate, and help with rearing and guarding any pups. Packmates keep in contact with frequent whines, perhaps because visibility is poor in the undergrowth where they typically hunt. While eating large prey, parents position themselves at either ends of the animal, making it easier for the pups to disembowel it.

== Reproduction ==
Bush dogs mate throughout the year; oestrus lasts up to twelve days and occurs every 15 to 44 days. Like many other canids, bush dog mating includes a copulatory tie, during which the animals are locked together. Urine-marking plays a significant role in their pre-copulatory behavior.

Gestation lasts from 65 to 83 days and normally results in the birth of a litter of three to six pups, although larger litters of up to 10 have been reported. The young are born blind and helpless and initially weigh . The eyes open after 14 to 19 days and the pups first emerge from the nativity den shortly thereafter. The young are weaned at around four weeks and reach sexual maturity at one year. They can live for up to 10 years in captivity.

== Conservation ==
Bush dogs are among the least-studied canines, and their conservation efforts are still in early stages. Due to their rarity, when bush dog bones were discovered in a cave in 1839, paleontologist Peter Wilhelm Lund mistakenly believed they were extinct. Living individuals were later found.

Research shows they are generalists capable of thriving in diverse habitats. However, conservation is challenging due to their dense habitats and sparse, scattered populations, making them difficult to locate. Bush dogs require large, undisturbed territories to support their pack-based lifestyle, and they are notably shy.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists bush dogs as Near Threatened due to a population decline of approximately 20-25% over the past 12 years. The main threats include habitat loss (particularly from deforestation for wood, cattle farming, and palm oil production), loss of prey due to human hunting, and diseases contracted from domestic dogs. Habitat loss, especially through Amazonian clear-cutting, is the most significant threat, while disease transmission from unvaccinated domestic dogs has also become a growing concern due to human encroachment.

Hunting bush dogs is illegal in most of their range, including countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Bolivia, Panama, and Argentina. However, Guyana and Suriname lack explicit hunting bans for bush dogs, and many countries in the bush dog’s range have limited resources to enforce existing wildlife laws.

To better understand and protect bush dogs, scientists are experimenting with various monitoring methods. Traditional camera traps have proven ineffective due to bush dogs&#x27; elusive nature, so researchers are now using scent-detection dogs to locate bush dog burrows. This approach aims to provide valuable insights into their habitat use, prey preferences, and pack dynamics, including when cubs leave the pack. Protected areas such as the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve may support stable populations.

In a positive development, bush dogs were recently captured on camera traps in Costa Rica&#x27;s Talamanca Mountains in 2020, suggesting they may be expanding their range northward and into higher elevations. This could indicate that with dedicated conservation efforts, bush dogs may stabilize or even increase in numbers.

<text>Norris Green is a suburb and ward of Liverpool, England, in the east of the city. At the 2001 Census it had a population of 17,784, which had fallen to 15,047 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
Historically a part of Lancashire, Norris Green&#x27;s development was announced in late 1925 and named after the Liverpool-based Norris family.

It is thought the land Norris Green was built on was donated to the city by Lord Derby, who was at the time resident at nearby Knowsley Hall. It is also suggested Lord Derby did not give the land away - he didn&#x27;t own it in the first place.

The area called Norris Green was a farming estate; it stretched as far as Stone Bridge House to the north and Norris Green Farm (opposite the junction of Hornspit Lane and Almonds Green) to the south. The sale boundary in the 1920s consisted of the railway, Carr Lane, Dwerryhouse Lane and Hornspit Lane. It was bought by the council for the sum of £65,000 from the estate of Leyland &amp; Naylor.

==Geography==
The area is defined by a number of major thoroughfares. These are: the A580 East Lancashire Road and a small portion of Walton Hall Avenue to the north; Lowerhouse Lane and Dwerryhouse Lane to the east; Muirhead Avenue and Queens Drive to the south and Townsend Avenue back to Walton Hall Avenue to the west.

The area is bordered by Walton to the west, Fazakerley to the north, Croxteth to the north east and east, West Derby to the south and Clubmoor to the south-west

Norris Green&#x27;s district centre is known locally as &quot;Broadway&quot;, consisting of mainly shops found around Broadway and Broad Lane (though this is actually located in neighbouring Clubmoor ward). The former North Liverpool Extension Line runs past this area and includes Broadway Bridge.

There are no actual pubs in the main residential area, but a small number of public houses do exist particularly around the vicinity of Broadway shops.

==Housing==
Homes on the periphery of the estate and on the main routes through the area are largely brick and well-built, with those on minor routes and residential roads made of concrete. It is this concrete group of housing that was considered defective.

The estate was subject to large-scale upgrading and renovation in the early 1970s, when it was still almost entirely under local authority ownership. This was several years before the introduction of the right to buy scheme, which gave council tenants the right to buy their homes from local authorities.

A large number of new homes have been constructed on derelict land cleared following the demolition of defective houses on the &quot;Boot Estate&quot;. Most of these demolitions took place around 2000.

==Landmarks==
The most notable landmark when approaching Norris Green from the north or west is the large former Cheshire Lines railway bridge, on the former Loop Line, crossing the junction of Utting Avenue and Townsend Avenue from north to south. A 1930s art deco public library is also widely recognised. The exterior and interior of Norris Green Youth Centre have been refurbished; this 2011 refurbishment, supported by the annual charity event &quot;Children in Need&quot;, was featured on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;DIY SOS&quot;.

==Transport==
There are a number of frequent bus services to and from Liverpool city centre via Norris Green and the Broadway area. The No.14 (will accept both Arriva or Stagecoach bus tickets or passes) bus is the main bus route running from the city centre to Willow Way, Croxteth. A major cross city bus route, the 61 Aigburth to Seaforth bus service also passes through the area. 
A project to provide a tram service, Merseytram, was abandoned due to a lack of funds.

<doc id="578553" wikidata="Q23004" url="?curid=578553" title="Bread roll">
<text>A bread roll is a small, oblong individual loaf of bread served as a meal accompaniment (eaten plain or with butter). Rolls can be served and eaten whole or are also commonly cut and filled – the result of doing so is considered a &quot;sandwich&quot; in English.

==Europe==
Rolls are common throughout Europe. Even in the same languages, rolls are known by a variety of names. Some European languages have many local and dialectal terms for bread rolls. These include German language diminutives of &quot;Brot&quot; (bread) in most of western and central Germany (where they are called &quot;Brötchen&quot;) and in Switzerland (where they are called &quot;Brötli&quot;). Other German language terms include &quot;Rundstück&quot; (&quot;round piece&quot;) in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein; &quot;Weckerl&quot; or more specific &quot;Semmel&quot; in Austria, Saxony and southern Bavaria; &quot;Weck&quot; and &quot;Weckle&quot; in much of Baden-Württemberg, Franconia and Saarland; &quot;Schrippe&quot; in Berlin and parts of Brandenburg. Some of these names reappear in other European languages as well, for example as &quot;zsemle&quot; in Hungarian, or &quot;rundstykker&quot; (&quot;round pieces&quot;) in Danish and Norwegian.
In the Netherlands they are called &quot;broodje&quot;.

&quot;Small bread&quot; is also found as Italian &quot;panino&quot;, which also commonly denotes a stuffed small bread roll. The &quot;Kaisersemmel&quot; reappears in Italy as the &quot;Michetta&quot; or &quot;Rosetta&quot;. In Swedish, a bread roll is a &quot;(frukost) bullar&quot; (&quot;(breakfast) buns&quot;), &quot;franskbrödbullar&quot; (&quot;french bread bun&quot;) or simply &quot;fralla&quot; (&quot;bun&quot;), comfort food eaten with butter and any kind of topping (marmalade, cheese, ham, salami) for special weekend breakfasts. The &quot;Doppelweck or Doppelbrötchen&quot; is a type of bread roll originating from the Saarland which consists of two rolls joined together side-by-side before baking.

There are many terms for a bread roll within the United Kingdom depending on region. These names include roll, and for a minority of the population (usually concentrated in specific regions) bap, barm cake, batch, breadcake, bun, cob, teacake and muffin. 

A variety of rolls are found in Europe, from white rolls made with wheat flour, to dark rolls containing mostly rye flour. Many variants include spices, such as coriander and cumin, or nuts. Also common are bread rolls containing or garnished with whole seeds such as sesame, poppy, pumpkin or sunflower.

<text>Ivan Frederick Boesky (; March 6, 1937 – May 20, 2024) was a convicted criminal and an American stock trader who was infamous for his prominent role in an insider trading scandal in the mid-1980s. After getting caught he became a government informant and then pleaded guilty, and was fined a record $100 million, and served twenty months in prison.

== Early life and education ==
Boesky was born to a Jewish family in Detroit. His family owned several delicatessens and taverns in the city. He attended the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills before graduating from Detroit&#x27;s Mumford High School. He then attended courses at Wayne State University in Detroit, Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Although he lacked an undergraduate degree, he was admitted to Detroit College of Law (now Michigan State University College of Law) and graduated in 1965. In the 1980s, Boesky served as an adjunct professor at Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Business and at New York University&#x27;s Graduate School of Business.

== Career ==
In 1966, Boesky and his wife moved to New York where he worked for several stock brokerage companies including L.F. Rothschild and Edwards &amp; Hanly. In 1975, he initiated his own stock brokerage company, Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Company, with $700,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) worth of start-up money from his wife&#x27;s family with a business plan that speculated on corporate takeovers. The company grew from profits as well as buy-in investments from new partnerships. By 1986, he had become an arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of more than US$200 million by betting on corporate takeovers and the $136 million in proceeds from the sale of the Beverly Hills Hotel.

In 1986, Boesky entered an agreement with the United States Attorney&#x27;s office for the Southern District of New York, agreeing to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit violations of the federal securities laws. He used inside information provided by Robert Wilkis and Ira Sokolow, two investment bankers, and purchased securities for entities with which he was affiliated. The inside information typically involved tender offers, mergers or other possible business combinations, for companies such as Nabisco Brands, Inc., R.J. Reynolds, and Houston Natural Gas Corp. &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a December 1, 1986, cover story about his &quot;scam,&quot; dubbing him &quot;Ivan the Terrible.&quot;

Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. He cooperated with the SEC and informed on others, including the case against financier Michael Milken and, per a plea bargain, received a prison sentence of years and was fined US$100 million. Although he was released after two years, he was permanently prohibited from working with securities. He served his sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison Camp near Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Boesky, unable to rehabilitate his reputation after being released from prison, paid hundreds of millions of dollars as fines and compensation for his Guinness share-trading fraud role and a number of separate insider-dealing scams. Later he began practicing Judaism, attended classes at Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and donated money to the seminary. In 1987, after the financial scandal fallout, he asked that his name be removed from the Jewish Theological Seminary Library.

== Personal life ==
In 1962, Boesky married Seema Silberstein, the daughter of a Detroit real estate magnate whose holdings included The Beverly Hills Hotel in California. After her father&#x27;s death, they won a court battle against her sister and brother-in-law over the hotel&#x27;s ownership.

In 1991, Silberstein divorced Boesky and agreed to pay him $23 million and $180,000 a year for life. They had four children. Ivan Boesky and his second wife, Ana, had another child. They lived in La Jolla, California, until his death on May 20, 2024 at the age of 87.

Boesky smoked Marlboro cigarettes.

== In popular culture ==
The character of Gordon Gekko in the movie &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987) is based in part on Boesky, particularly his &quot;greed is good&quot; speech which resembled the commencement speech Boesky delivered in May 1986 at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley: &quot;I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.&quot;

Boesky was featured in a CNBC documentary titled &quot;Empires of New York&quot;.

<text>William Sherille Levise Jr. (born February 26, 1945), known professionally as Mitch Ryder, is an American rock singer who has recorded more than 25 albums over more than four decades.

==Career==
Ryder was born on February 26, 1945, in Hamtramck, Michigan. He spent his high school years in Warren, Michigan, a suburb north of Detroit. He formed his first band, Tempest, when he was in high school, and the group gained some notice playing at a Detroit soul music club called The Village. Ryder next appeared fronting a band named Billy Lee &amp; The Rivieras, which had limited success until they met songwriter / record producer Bob Crewe. He selected his stage name when he saw &quot;Mitch Ryder&quot; in the Manhattan telephone directory and renamed the group Mitch Ryder &amp; The Detroit Wheels. They recorded several hit records for his DynoVoice Records and New Voice labels in the mid to late 1960s, most notably 1966&#x27;s &quot;Devil with a Blue Dress On&quot;, their highest-charting single at number four, as well as &quot;Jenny Take a Ride!&quot; which reached number 10 in 1965, and &quot;Sock It to Me, Baby!&quot;, a number six hit in 1967. The Detroit Wheels were John Badanjek on drums, Mark Manko on lead guitar, Joe Kubert (not to be confused with the comic book illustrator Joe Kubert) on rhythm guitar, Jim McCarty (not to be confused with the Yardbirds drummer of the same name) on lead guitar and Jim McAllister on bass.

In December 1966, producer Bob Crewe&#x27;s vision for Mitch as a blue-eyed soul singer backed by a horn band (a la Wilson Pickett, Joe Tex, etc.) was put into motion. They assembled a 10 piece band of white R&amp;B musicians: from Baltimore, Maryland; Jimmy Wilson (trumpet), Bob Shipley (sax), Jimmy Loomis (sax), Don Lehnhoff (trombone), Frank Invernizzi (organ); from Chicago, Illinois; John Siomos (drums), Bob Slawson (guitar), Carmine Riale (bass guitar); from Miami, Florida; Andy Dio (trumpet); from New York; Johnny ? (lead guitar). The band rehearsed for a month in a dance studio above Cheetah, a night club at Broadway and 53rd, then hit the road as The Mitch Ryder Show in February 1967.

Ryder was the last person to perform with Otis Redding; they performed the song &quot;Knock On Wood&quot;, on December 9, 1967, in Cleveland, Ohio, on a local TV show called &quot;Upbeat&quot;. Redding and four members of his touring band, The Bar-Kays, died in a plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin the following day, December 10, 1967.

Ryder&#x27;s musical endeavors were less successful after the early 1970s. Ryder&#x27;s participation with the Detroit Wheels ended just as the counterculture was becoming dominant in 1968. During 1968, trumpeters Mike Thuroff and John Stefan were hired to tour with his horn section and band. Thuroff and Stefan also recorded the trumpet parts of Ryder&#x27;s song, &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;. This song was not permitted to be played by radio in many states due to its sexual innuendos. Ryder had one hit single from that period, a cover version of &quot;What Now, My Love&quot;. In the early 70&#x27;s, he formed the band Detroit. The only other original Wheel in the group was the drummer John Badanjek; other members were guitarists Steve Hunter, Brett Tuggle, organist Harry Phillips, and bassist W.R. Cooke. A single album was released by this grouping, a 1971 self-titled LP issued on Paramount Records (US #176 in 1972). They had a hit with their version of the Lou Reed-penned song &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, which Reed liked enough to ask Steve Hunter to join his backing band. Detroit was tagged by the critics as the &quot;American Rolling Stones&quot;. 

According to AllMusic (which calls Ryder &quot;the unsung hero&quot; of Michigan rock and roll), Ryder withdrew from music in 1973 after experiencing throat trouble, moving to Colorado with his wife and taking up writing and painting. In 1983, Ryder returned to a major label with the John Mellencamp-produced album &quot;Never Kick a Sleeping Dog&quot;. The album featured a cover version of the Prince song &quot;When You Were Mine&quot;, which was Ryder&#x27;s last score on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Ryder continues to record and tour in the United States and Europe. In 2005, Mitch Ryder &amp; The Detroit Wheels were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. In 2009, Mitch Ryder was inducted as a solo artist. On February 14, 2012, Ryder released &quot;The Promise&quot;, his first US release in almost 30 years.

==Influence==

Ryder has influenced the music of such blue collar rock music artists as Bob Seger, John Mellencamp, and also Bruce Springsteen, whose version of the song &quot;Devil With a Blue Dress&quot; was part of the &quot;No Nukes&quot; concert album in the early 1980s. He has also been cited as a primary musical influence by Ted Nugent.

In concert, Bruce Springsteen has often featured a performance informally known as &quot;Detroit Medley&quot; that includes the songs &quot;Devil with a Blue Dress&quot;, &quot;Jenny Take a Ride&quot;, &quot;Good Golly Miss Molly&quot; and &quot;C.C. Rider&quot;. The medley from time to time blends in a variety of other songs, but this remains the core section, often featuring guitar solos from Springsteen and piano solos by Roy Bittan.

Winona Ryder, the stage name of Winona Laura Horowitz, was inspired by Mitch Ryder&#x27;s music.

Ryder has been credited by guitarist Steve Hunter for giving Hunter his first real break in rock and roll and introducing Hunter to producer Bob Ezrin. In 2017 he was inducted into the Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame.

Ritchie Blackmore acknowledged the influence of Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels on the type of beat Deep Purple chose for their version of &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot;, the song by Neil Diamond.

<text>Patricide (or paternal homicide) is the act of killing one&#x27;s own father. The word &quot;patricide&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;pater&quot; (father) and the suffix &quot;-cida&quot; (cutter or killer). Patricide is a sub-form of parricide, which is defined as an act of killing a close relative. In many cultures and religions, patricide was considered one of the worst sins. For example, according to Marcus Tullius Cicero, in the Roman Republic it was the only crime for which the civilian could be sentenced to death.

==Patricides in myths and religions==
Patricide is a common motif that is prevalent throughout many religions and cultures, and particularly in the mythology and religion of Greek culture. Some key examples of patricide from various cultures are included as follows:
* Apsu, in the Babylonian creation epic the &quot;Enûma Elish&quot;, was killed by his son Ea in the struggle for supremacy among the gods.
* In the mythology of the neighboring Mesopotamian Hurrian people the storm god Teshub kills his father Kumarbi, sometimes jointly with his grandfather Anu in reciprocity for an attempted patricide by Kumarbi.
* In the Greek creation epic, first recorded in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Cronus was jealous of his father Uranus&#x27; power as ruler of the universe. Cronus thus killed or castrated his father. Cronus, in turn, was overthrown by his own son, Zeus.
* Oedipus was fated to kill his father, a king, and marry his mother. His parents attempted to prevent this by leaving him on the side of a mountain as an infant. He was found and raised by a shepherd. Once grown, Oedipus meets his father while his father is traveling, but not knowing who he is, ends up killing him. He then unknowingly marries his mother to become king, ultimately fulfilling the prophecy.
* Pelias was killed by his daughters, who were deceived by Medea into thinking he could be resurrected.
* In the Hindu epic Mahabharata, Babruvahana killed his father Arjun, but Arjun was brought back to life by his wife, the snake goddess Uloopi.
* In Chinese belief, people who commit patricide (or matricide) will be killed by a lightning strike as a punishment from filial and warrior deity Erlang Shen.
* In Norse mythology, Fafnir murdered his father Hreidmar to gain the cursed golden ring of Andvari that he had obtained. Some versions say that his brother Regin helped him.
*In the legend of West Java, Indonesia, Tangkuban Perahu, Sangkuriang, is said to have killed his father, who was a dog, because he did not get any prey.

<text>The Sargasso Sea () is a region of the Atlantic Ocean bounded by four currents forming an ocean gyre. Unlike all other regions called seas, it has no land boundaries. It is distinguished from other parts of the Atlantic Ocean by its characteristic brown &quot;Sargassum&quot; seaweed and often calm blue water.

The sea is bounded on the west by the Gulf Stream, on the north by the North Atlantic Current, on the east by the Canary Current, and on the south by the North Atlantic Equatorial Current, the four together forming a clockwise-circulating system of ocean currents termed the North Atlantic Gyre. It lies between 20° and 35° north and 40° and 70° west and is approximately wide by long. Bermuda is near the western fringes of the sea.

While all of the above currents deposit marine plants and refuse into the sea, ocean water in the Sargasso Sea is distinctive for its deep blue color and exceptional clarity, with underwater visibility of up to . It is also a body of water that has captured the public imagination, and so is seen in a wide variety of literary and artistic works and in popular culture.

==History==
A chart drawn by the Catalan cartographer, Gabriel de Vallseca of Mallorca, has been interpreted to indicate that the Azores were first discovered by Diogo de Silves in 1427. In 1431, Gonçalo Velho was dispatched with orders to determine the location of &quot;islands&quot; first identified by de Silves. Velho apparently got as far as the Formigas, in the eastern archipelago, before having to return to Sagres, probably due to bad weather.

By this time, the Portuguese navigators had also reached the Sargasso Sea (western North Atlantic region), naming it after the &quot;Sargassum&quot; seaweed growing there (&quot;sargaço&quot; / &quot;sargasso&quot; in Portuguese).

Later in 1492, Christopher Columbus wrote about seaweed that he feared would trap his ship and potentially hide shallow waters that could run them aground, as well as a lack of wind that he feared would trap them.

The sea may have been known to earlier mariners, as a poem by the late fourth century author Avienius describes a portion of the Atlantic as being covered with seaweed and windless, citing a now-lost account by the fifth century BC Carthaginian Himilco the Navigator. Columbus himself was aware of this account and thought Himilco had reached the Sargasso Sea, as did several other explorers. However, modern scholars consider this unlikely.

In 1609, the English vessel &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was blown to the shore of Bermuda. The sea has also been the site of whaling and fishing.

The 1920–1922 Dana expeditions, led by Johannes Schmidt, determined that the European eel&#x27;s breeding sites were in the Sargasso Sea. The sea has played a role in a number of other pioneering research efforts, including William Beebe and Otis Barton&#x27;s 1932 dive where they conducted observations of animals and radio broadcasts, John Swallow&#x27;s work on the Swallow float in the late 1950s, the discovery of &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; by a team of researchers in the 1980s, and various oceanographic data gathering programs such as those of Henry Stommel.

In July 1969, British businessman and amateur sailor Donald Crowhurst disappeared after his yacht became mired in the Sargasso Sea. He had been competing in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Golden Globe Race, a single-handed, round-the-world yacht race when his poorly prepared boat began to take on water. He abandoned his circumnavigation attempt, but reported false positions by radio in an attempt to give the impression that he was still participating. Eventually, Crowhurst wound up drifting in the Sargasso Sea, where he deteriorated psychologically, filling his logbooks with metaphysical speculation and delusional comments. His last entry was July 1, and his yacht was found unoccupied and drifting on July 10. It is unclear whether his death came as the result of suicide or misadventure.

== Boundaries ==
The sea is bounded on the west by the Gulf Stream, on the north by the North Atlantic Current, on the east by the Canary Current, and on the south by the North Atlantic Equatorial Current, the four together forming a clockwise-circulating system of ocean currents termed the North Atlantic Gyre. It lies between 20° to 35° N and 40° and 70° W and is approximately wide by long. Bermuda is near the western fringes of the sea.

Because the Sargasso Sea is bordered by oceanic currents, its precise borders may change. The Canary Current in particular is widely variable, and often the line utilized is one west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. A 2011 report based the sea&#x27;s boundaries on several variables including currents, presence of seaweed, and the topography of the ocean floor, and determined that the specific boundaries of the sea were &quot;between 22°–38°N, 76°–43°W and centred on 30°N and 60°W&quot; for a total of around .

==Ecology==

The Sargasso Sea is home to seaweed of the genus &quot;Sargassum&quot;, which floats en masse on the surface. The Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt is the largest such mass in the world. The sargassum masses generally are not a threat to shipping, and historic incidents of sailing ships being trapped there are due to the often-calm winds of the horse latitudes.

The Sargasso Sea plays a role in the migration of catadromous eel species such as the European eel, the American eel, and the American conger eel. The larvae of these species hatch within the sea, and as they grow they travel to Europe or the East Coast of North America. Later in life, the matured eel migrates back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn and lay eggs. It is also believed that after hatching, young loggerhead sea turtles use currents such as the Gulf Stream to travel to the Sargasso Sea, where they use the sargassum as cover from predators until they are mature. The sargassum fish is a species of frogfish specially adapted to blend in among the sargassum seaweed. Millions of European eel babies are born there and then make a three-year journey back to UK waters; many seabird species also fly and feed across it on their way to Britain. 

In the early 2000s, the Sargasso Sea was sampled as part of the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition, to evaluate its diversity of microbial life through metagenomics. Contrary to previous theories, results indicated the area has a wide variety of prokaryotic life.

Commonly called seaweed, &quot;Sargassum&quot; is a type of macroalgae. Like all algae, it produces oxygen. Based on 1975 measurements of oxygen production, and estimates of the total mass of &quot;Sargassum&quot; in the sea, it can be calculated that the Sargasso Sea may produce 2.2 billion litres of O₂ per hour, making the sea one of the primary sources of atmospheric oxygen.

== Threats ==
The Sargasso Sea, like many unique ocean ecosystems, is under various threats, such as industrial-scale fishing, plastic waste pollution, oil drilling, and deep-sea mining. 
===Pollution===
Owing to surface currents, the Sargasso accumulates a high concentration of non-biodegradable plastic waste. The area contains the huge North Atlantic garbage patch.

Several nations and nongovernmental organizations have united to protect the Sargasso Sea. These organizations include the Sargasso Sea Commission
established 11 March 2014 by the governments of the Azores (Portugal), Bermuda (United Kingdom), Monaco, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Bacteria that consume plastic have been found in the plastic-polluted waters of the Sargasso Sea; however, it is unknown whether these bacteria ultimately clean up poisons or simply spread them elsewhere in the marine microbial ecosystem. Plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution, potentially poisoning anything that eats it.

=== Others ===
Human activity in the Sargasso Sea has negatively affected it, such as over-fishing and shipping.

==Depictions in popular culture==
The Sargasso Sea is often portrayed in literature and the media as an area of mystery. It is often depicted in fiction as a dangerous area where ships are mired in weed for centuries, unable to escape. Outer-space equivalents are a recurring motif in science fiction.

=== Literature ===
Ezra Pound&#x27;s opens with the line: &quot;Your mind and you are our Sargasso Sea&quot;, suggesting that the woman addressed in the poem is a repository of trivia and disconnected facts.

The Sargasso Sea features in classic fantasy stories by William Hope Hodgson, such as his novel &quot;The Boats of the &quot;Glen Carrig&quot;&quot; (1907), Victor Appleton&#x27;s Don Sturdy novel &quot;Don Sturdy in the Port of Lost Ships: Or, Adrift in the Sargasso Sea&quot;, and several related short stories. Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot; describes the Sargasso Sea and gives an account of its formation. Thomas Allibone Janvier&#x27;s 1898 novel is titled &quot;In the Sargasso Sea&quot;.

&quot;Uncharted Seas&quot; (1938) is a fantasy novel by Dennis Wheatley about a tramp steamer trapped in the Sargasso Sea surrounded by killer seaweed, murderous crustaceans, and previously marooned descendants of Spanish Conquistadores and pirates. This was made into an adventure film, &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; (1968), by Hammer Films and Seven Arts.

&quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; (1966) by Jean Rhys is inspired by Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and gives Bertha Mason&#x27;s history, experiences and perspective. Two film adaptations of the same name have been released, one in 1993 and another in 2006.

&quot;Prisoners of the Sargasso Sea&quot; was a story published in &quot;Batman&quot; number 122 dated March 1959. Batman encounters ships trapped there for centuries. Batman and Robin are welcomed by the pirate Jolly Roger, Erik of Norway and Flavius from ancient Rome. They explain to Batman that a strange mist from the seaweed keeps them alive and ageless.

<text>The Mendenhall Valley (colloquially The Valley) [Lingít: &quot;Áakʼw Táak&quot;] is the drainage area of the Mendenhall River in the U.S. state of Alaska. The valley contains a series of neighborhoods, comprising the largest populated place within the corporate limits of the City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska&#x27;s capital.

The valley was formed by Mendenhall Glacier over the course of roughly three thousand years. It was named for the American physicist and meteorologist Thomas Corwin Mendenhall.

The Mendenhall Valley begins ten miles from the downtown area, at the intersection of Egan Drive and Glacier Highway, and ends ten miles farther west at the intersection of Glacier Highway and Mendenhall Loop Road at Auke Bay. The Valley comprises an area stretching from the wetlands along Fritz Cove and Auke Bay back to the Mendenhall Glacier as well as Mendenhall Lake and the Mendenhall River, which for the most part drains the Valley.

The Valley forms the core of Alaska&#x27;s 34th election (or state House) district, which is represented in the Alaska House of Representatives by Andi Story, a Democrat. Along with the rest of Juneau and adjoining communities, it is part of Senate District Q, represented in the Alaska Senate by Jesse Kiehl, a Democrat.

There are four elementary schools (Auke Bay, Glacier Valley, Mendenhall River, and Riverbend), one middle school (Floyd Dryden), and one high school (Thunder Mountain) located in Mendenhall Valley. Most of Juneau&#x27;s churches are located in the Valley.

<text>Mud season (US English) or breakup (Canadian English) is a period in late winter and early spring when travel over ice is no longer safe and travel overland is more difficult as frozen earth thaws and soil becomes muddy from melting snow.

==Description==

Mud season occurs in places where the ground freezes in winter and thaws in spring. Dirt roads and paths become muddy because the deeply frozen ground thaws from the surface down as the air temperature warms above freezing. The frozen lower layers of ground prevent water from percolating into the soil so the surface layers of soil become saturated with water.

Clay-based soil, especially when combined with poor drainage, is especially prone to forming deep and sticky mud. In sandy soils, the top unfrozen layer becomes waterlogged during thaws, but does not form viscous mud. On the Great Plains, a particular type of clay (bentonite clay, or aluminum phyllosilicate) turns into a sticky form of soil called gumbo during snowmelt and spring rains.

Mud season can be expensive for towns due to the damage done to dirt roads. One report concluded that the cost of re-engineering dirt roads so that they would remain passable during mud season in the state of Vermont could run as high as .

Transportation problems during mud season have military implications, due to the bogging down of horses and military equipment in deep mud. 

During mud season, soil becomes fragile and care must be exercised in protected and recreational areas.

===&quot;Breakup&quot;===
&quot;Breakup&quot; originally referred to the &quot;breaking up&quot; of river and lake ice. This event is eagerly anticipated in many regions of Canada, because it marks when different modes of transportation can be used. Vehicles from dog sleds to snowmobiles and even tractor trailers can safely traverse ice roads in the winter and aircraft with skis for landing gear can land on ice in winter, but not near breakup. By contrast after breakup, various boats can once again use the water.

The exact date this occurs varies across the North, and corresponds to different seasons in the indigenous calendars of different regions. In the Cree and Ojibwe calendars, one of the six seasons is called minoskamin (Woods Cree: , &quot;mithoskamin&quot;; Atikamekw: &quot;miroskamin&quot;, etc.) which is usually translated as &quot;breakup&quot;. For the Woods Cree of Northern Saskatchewan this occurred in roughly May and June on the English calendar before the effects of recent climate change. By contrast the New England mud season of (or &quot;unlocking&quot; as Kurt Vonnegut called it) is in March and April.

Famously, the exact date of the breakup on the Yukon River in Dawson City has been the subject of gambling since the Klondike Gold Rush, providing climate researchers with a rare unbroken record of climate data in such a remote region.

The sense of &quot;breakup&quot; was later expanded to the time of the year when the frozen soil that can support heavy vehicles softens. This is especially used in the oil patch (which is concentrated on the Great Plains and western portions of the boreal forest of Canada (i.e. the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin) when well drilling activity halts and work camps &quot;break up&quot; for the spring.

==Around the world==
The term &quot;mud season&quot; is used in northern climates in North America, particularly in rural northern New England and the northern areas of the Great Lakes. It is often jokingly called the &quot;fifth season&quot;. While significantly muddy conditions also occur throughout the Appalachians and in other mountainous regions, they are not as tightly tied to season.

Similar terms are Swedish &quot;bad going&quot; and Finnish &quot;broken state of roads&quot; (lit. &quot;weather-break&quot;), but both also apply to when water is too iced over for boats but not strong enough to cross on foot or in other vehicles. Finnish eastern dialects also have the loanword (), which has the same usage as .
===Eastern Europe===
The in Russian (literally &quot;season of bad roads&quot;), or in Ukrainian, is a term for the mud season that occurs in various rural areas of Eastern Europe, when the rapid snowmelt or thawing of frozen ground combined with wet weather in Spring, or heavy rains in the Autumn, lead to muddy conditions that make travel on unpaved roads problematic and even treacherous.

Rasputitsa has repeatedly &quot;rescued&quot; Russia during wars by causing enemy vehicles and artillery pieces to become mired in the mud, and has been credited, alongside the general conditions of winter, with incumbering both the military campaigns of Napoleon and Hitler in the 20th century, as well as Putin in his 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Further back in history, the Mongols may also have been deterred from attacking Novgorod by the muddy bog produced by an early spring thaw. 

Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, some analysts identified the logistical challenges of the mud season as a likely hindrance to any large-scale invasion in spring. When Russia crossed the border, many of its mobile units found themselves stranded in fields and limited to major roads, where resistance and logistical issues significantly slowed the advance toward Kyiv and elsewhere.

== Cultural references ==
In Maine, Vermont, upstate New York, and New Hampshire, the phrase &quot;mud season&quot; can be used as a shorthand reference to the vicissitudes and peculiarities of life in the region. The term has been used as the title of magazines, books, and at least one movie.

<doc id="578606" wikidata="Q4570148" url="?curid=578606" title="Zhanshan Temple">
<text>Zhanshan Temple (; ) is a Buddhist temple in Shinan District of Qingdao, Shandong, China. It is located on the southern side of Zhanshan (literally &#x27;clear&#x27; or &#x27;deep mountain&#x27;), facing the sea.

In 2004 a major renovation was initiated. As of June 2009, the renovation remains in progress.

Cham Shan Monastery in Hong Kong is named after it and is designed based on it.

== Features ==
The monastery was completed in 1945 and is an active, functional Buddhist sanctuary. Apart from the Stupa and the Olympic Mascot Bell Tower, located on the right-hand side of the grounds, the remaining buildings are situated in a rectangular format. To the right of the entry portal is one of the several Buddhist scripture shops. Here, incense sticks and other Buddhist supplies are available for purchase. Adjacent the scripture shop is a Bell tower with the first of many statues of Buddha. At the right of the entry is the Drum tower with another Buddha.

Returning to the central path, directly ahead is the Four Heavenly Kings Hall. The large Buddha, which is the focal point of this shrine, is flanked by four large statues, one depicting a pipa player. Directly behind Heavenly King Hall is the larger Mahavira Hall, which honors the founder of Buddhism, the son of a king of the Sakya clan of the Kshatriya (i.e., warriors). His given name was Siddhartha, his family name, Gautama. The epithet “Sakyamuni” means “sage of the Sakyas.” In this magnificent hall, a large, central Buddha is flanked by two smaller statues, each attended by eight priests. This hall is an active place of prayer equipped with cushions for kneeling, candles for lighting incense, and other Buddhist prayer supplies.

Behind the Hall of Sakyamuni is the Hall of Three Saints (). In the center of the hall are three large, gilded statues, each about twelve feet in height.

Continuing along the central path, the next building is the Preaching Hall (). To the left of Preaching Hall is the Hall of the Recumbent Buddha (), where, behind a long, gilded altar, a gilded, bejeweled statue of Buddha stretches out almost twenty feet in length.

Opposite the Hall of the Recumbent Buddha is the Shandong Zhanshan Buddhist College (). To the right of the Hall of the Recumbent Buddha is the headquarters of the Qingdao Buddhist Association (). Exiting the monastery grounds, one passes the Olympic Mascot Bell (). The view from the top of this bell tower is panoramic; however, there is an additional fee of 10 CNY to see that view.

== Annual events ==
The 8 April of the lunar calendar is traditionally observed as the birthday of the Buddha. On that day, thousands of Buddhists flock to the monastery grounds to attend religious events.

<text>In political science, a proxy war is an armed conflict where at least one of the belligerents is directed or supported by an external third-party power. In the term &quot;proxy war&quot;, a belligerent with external support is the &quot;proxy&quot;; both belligerents in a proxy war can be considered proxies if both are receiving foreign military aid from a third party country. Acting either as a nation-state government or as a conventional force, a proxy belligerent acts in behalf of a third-party state sponsor. 

A proxy war is characterised by a direct, long-term, geopolitical relationship between the third-party sponsor states and their client states or non-state clients, thus the political sponsorship becomes military sponsorship when the third-party powers fund the soldiers and their &quot;matériel&quot; to equip the belligerent proxy-army to launch and fight and sustain a war to victory, and government power. However, the relationship between sponsors and proxies can be characterized by principal-agent problems whereby the sponsor may be unable to control the actions of the proxy.

==History==

During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, many non-state proxies were external parties that were introduced into an internal conflict and aligned themselves with a belligerent to gain influence and to further their own interests in the region. Proxies could be introduced by an external or local power and most commonly took the form of irregular armies which were used to achieve their sponsor&#x27;s goals in a contested region. Some medieval states like the Byzantine Empire used proxy warfare as a foreign-policy tool by deliberately cultivating intrigue among hostile rivals and then backing them when they went to war with each other. Other states regarded proxy wars as merely a useful extension of a pre-existing conflict, such as France and England during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, both of which initiated a longstanding practice of supporting privateers, which targeted the other&#x27;s merchant shipping. France used England&#x27;s turmoil of the Wars of the Roses from their victory as a proxy, siding with the Lancastrians against the Yorkists who were backed by the Burgundian State. The Ottoman Empire likewise used the Barbary pirates as proxies to harass Western European powers in the Mediterranean Sea.

Frequent application of the term &quot;proxy war&quot; indicates its prominent place in academic research on international relations. Distinct implementations of soft power and hard power have proved to be unsuccessful in recent years. Accordingly, great failures in classic wars increased the tendency to use proxy wars. Since the early twentieth century, proxy wars have most commonly taken the form of states assuming the role of sponsors to non-state proxies and essentially using them as fifth columns to undermine adversarial powers. That type of proxy warfare includes external support for a faction engaged in a civil war, terrorists, national-liberation movements, and insurgent groups, or assistance to a national revolt against foreign occupation. For example, the British government partially organized and instigated the Arab Revolt to undermine the Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Many proxy wars began assuming a distinctive ideological dimension after the Spanish Civil War, which pitted the fascist political ideology of Italy and Nazi Germany against the communist ideology of the Soviet Union without involving these states in open warfare with each other. Sponsors of both sides also used the Spanish conflict as a proving ground for their own weapons and battlefield tactics.

During the Cold War, proxy warfare was motivated by fears that an armed conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union by conventional warfare would result in nuclear holocaust, which rendered the use of ideological proxies a safer way to conduct hostilities. The Soviet government found that supporting parties antagonistic to the U.S. and other Western nations was a cost-effective way to combat NATO&#x27;s influence compared to direct military engagement. Additionally, the proliferation of televised media and its impact on public perception made the U.S. public especially susceptible to war-weariness and being skeptical of risking life abroad. That encouraged the American practice of arming insurgent forces, such as the funnelling of supplies to the mujahideen during the Soviet–Afghan War. Other examples of proxy war include the Korean War and the Vietnam War.

==Abstract==

The governments of some nations, particularly liberal democracies, may choose to engage in proxy warfare (despite their military superiority) if most of their citizens oppose declaring or entering a conventional war. That featured prominently in US strategy following the Vietnam War because of the so-called &quot;Vietnam Syndrome&quot; of extreme war weariness among the American population. That was also a significant factor in motivating the US to enter conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War by proxy actors after a series of costly drawn-out direct engagements in the Middle East spurred a recurrence of war weariness, the &quot;War on Terror syndrome.&quot;

Nations may also resort to proxy warfare to avoid potential negative international reactions from allied nations, profitable trading partners, or intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations. That is especially significant when standing peace treaties, acts of the alliance or other international agreements ostensibly forbid direct warfare. Breaking such agreements could lead to a variety of negative consequences due to either negative international reaction (see above), punitive provisions listed in the prior agreement, or retaliatory action by the other parties and their allies.

In some cases, nations may be motivated to engage in proxy warfare because of financial concerns: supporting irregular troops, insurgents, non-state actors, or less-advanced allied militaries (often with obsolete or surplus equipment) can be significantly cheaper than deploying national armed forces, and the proxies usually bear the brunt of casualties and economic damage resulting from prolonged conflict.

Another common motivating factor is the existence of a security dilemma. A nation may use military intervention to install a more favorable government in a third-party state. Rival nations may perceive the intervention as a weakened position to their own security and may respond by attempting to undermine such efforts, often by backing parties favorable to their own interests (such as those directly or indirectly under their control, sympathetic to their cause, or ideologically aligned). In that case, if one or both rivals come to believe that their favored faction is at a disadvantage, they will often respond by escalating military and/or financial support. If their counterpart(s), perceiving a material threat or desiring to avoid the appearance of weakness or defeat, follow suit, a proxy war ensues between the two powers. That was a major factor in many of the proxy wars during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as in the ongoing series of conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran, especially in Yemen and Syria.

==Effects==
Proxy wars can have a huge impact, especially on the local area. A proxy war with significant effects occurred between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Vietnam War. Operation Rolling Thunder, a U.S bombing campaign in North Vietnam destroyed significant amounts of infrastructure. Many bombs were also dropped on North Vietnamese supply routes in Cambodia and Laos. Equally, if not more, significant was the Soviet–Afghan War, which saw the U.S. fund the Afghan mujahideen against the invading Soviet forces (see Operation Cyclone). This war cost hundreds of thousands of lives and billions of dollars, bankrupting the Soviet Union and contributing to its collapse.

The conflict in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran is another example of the destructive impact of proxy wars. Since 2003, nearly 500,000 have died in the Iraqi conflict. Since 2011, more than 500,000 have died in the Syrian Civil War. Over 377,000 people had died in the Yemeni Civil War by early 2022. In the war in Afghanistan, more than 176,000 were killed between 2001 and 2021. In Pakistan, more than 57,000 have been killed since 2003.

In general, lengths, intensities, and scales of armed conflicts are often greatly increased if belligerents&#x27; capabilities are augmented by external support. Belligerents are often less likely to engage in diplomatic negotiations, peace talks are less likely to bear fruit, and damage to infrastructure can be many times greater.

<doc id="578615" wikidata="Q5630713" url="?curid=578615" title="HMCS Athabaskan (G07)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was the first of three destroyers of the Royal Canadian Navy to bear this name. It was a destroyer of the , that served in the Second World War. She was named for the First Nations peoples who make up the Athabaskan language group. She was torpedoed in the English Channel and sunk in 1944.

&quot;Athabaskan&quot; was ordered 5 April 1940 as part of the 1940-1941 building programme. She was laid down in the United Kingdom on 31 October 1940 by Vickers-Armstrongs of High Walker and built in consort with CA Parsons engine works. She was launched on 18 November 1941 and commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 3 February 1943.

==Service history==
HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot; had a relatively short service of about 14 months between her commissioning and sinking. The ship also experienced several major mishaps and battle damage that required her being taken out of service for repairs for a total of about five months. When these repair periods are taken into account, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was available for actual service at sea for a total of only nine months prior to her sinking.

After a short work-up subsequent to commissioning on 3 February 1943, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; sailed on 29 March 1943 to patrol the Iceland-Faeroes Passage for blockade runners, but heavy seas damaged her hull, which took five weeks to repair at South Shields. Shortly after returning to service, in early June 1943 she took part in Operation Gearbox III, the relief of the garrison at Spitsbergen.

On 18 June 1943, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; sustained damage during a collision with the boom defence vessel &quot;Bargate&quot; at Scapa Flow, resulting in a month under repair at Devonport. In July and August 1943, she was based in Plymouth, carrying out anti-submarine patrols in the Bay of Biscay.

&quot;Athabaskan&quot; was heavily damaged by a Henschel Hs 293 glider bomb, dropped by a KG 100 aircraft, during an anti-submarine chase off Cape Ortegal, in the Bay of Biscay, on 27 August 1943. was sunk in the same incident. The glider bomb passed entirely through &quot;Athabaskan&quot; before detonating on the outside of the ship.

Returning to Scapa Flow in December 1943 she escorted convoy JW55A to the Soviet Union but in February 1944, rejoined Plymouth command and was assigned to the newly formed 10th Destroyer Flotilla carrying out ‘Operation Hostile’ (Minelaying) and ‘Operation Tunnel’ (Patrol) missions off the coast of France. On 26 April, she assisted in the destruction of the German in the English Channel off Ushant as part of an ‘Operation Tunnel’ mission that included the British cruiser , destroyer and Canadian Tribals , and &quot;Athabaskan&quot;. Three days later &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was sunk in another action.

==Final action, sinking==
On 29 April 1944 at about 0300 hours &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was patrolling with her sister Tribal-class destroyer &quot;Haida&quot; in support of a British minelaying operation off the coast of France near the mouth of the Morlaix River. She received the first of a series of Admiralty orders to intercept German warships near Ile de Bas (sometimes Île de Batz) as spotted by coastal radar in southern England. During the subsequent engagement with German naval vessels, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was torpedoed and sank. 128 men were lost, 44 were rescued by &quot;Haida&quot; and 83 were taken prisoner by three German minesweepers sortied from the coast after the departure of &quot;Haida&quot;.

As might be expected with a night-time naval battle, various sources and even eyewitnesses provide widely differing accounts of the events surrounding the sinking of &quot;Athabaskan&quot;. Some survivors recount that the ship was initially struck by shore-battery gunfire, and then by a torpedo. At least one survivor tells of a second torpedo hit fifteen minutes after the first, but the official history of the Royal Canadian Navy attributes the second major explosion to the fires touching off the ammunition magazine.

&quot;Athabaskan&quot; was apparently torpedoed by the German torpedo boat . &quot;Athabaskan&quot;″s commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander John Stubbs, was killed in action after declining rescue by &quot;Haida&quot; to swim back for more crew members. In 2004, the Royal Canadian Navy provided a brass plaque to be laid on the wreck to commemorate the loss. The expedition found more information about the sinking but did not clarify the actual cause. The wreck is in a shattered condition spread over the sea bed.

==HMCS &quot;Haida&quot; motor cutter rescue==

When &quot;Haida&quot; quickly departed the area due to the onset of daylight and heightened risk from air and sea attacks, she left behind her motor cutter manned by Leading Seaman W. A. MacLure, Jack Hannam and three volunteers. MacLure and his comrades rescued six &quot;Athabaskan&quot; survivors along with two &quot;Haida&quot; crew who had been washed from the scramble nets as the ship departed. As recounted in Canada&#x27;s official naval history, the German minesweepers chased the motor cutter but gave up for unknown reasons. After a series of breakdowns and encounters with enemy aircraft, MacLure&#x27;s motor cutter eventually made landfall in England under Royal Air Force escort just before midnight on 29 April 1944.

==Legacy==
Athabaskan Island, near Bella Bella on the Central Coast of British Columbia, was named in memory of &quot;Athabaskan&quot;.

École John Stubbs Memorial School near Victoria, British Columbia is named for Lieutenant Commander John Stubbs.

<text>George Johnson Clarke (October 10, 1857 – February 26, 1917) was a New Brunswick lawyer, journalist and politician.

A native of St. Andrews, New Brunswick, George Clarke taught school for a time in Charlotte County before studying law. He was called to the bar in 1885 and set up practice in St. Stephen. He was also editor of the &quot;Saint Croix Courier&quot; newspaper in St. Stephen. In 1907, he was named King&#x27;s Counsel.

In 1891, Clarke was an unsuccessful candidate in the Charlotte riding for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. He served as mayor of St. Stephen from 1898 to 1899 and was Warden of Charlotte County. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick for Charlotte County in 1903 and served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1909 to 1914. On January 22, 1914, Clarke was appointed by Premier James K. Flemming to the province&#x27;s Executive Council as Attorney General and Commissioner of Provincial Hospitals. He served until December 17 of that year when he was appointed Minister of Lands and Mines, a position he held until February 1, 1917.

Highly regarded for his integrity, George Clarke became the 15th premier of New Brunswick in March 1914 when his predecessor, James Kidd Flemming, was forced to resign as a result of a scandal. In addition to his responsibilities as Premier, Clarke also served as the Minister of Lands and Mines during his entire administration.

George Clarke was in very poor health during his time in office and his administration&#x27;s accomplishments were limited. Because of the health problems, he stepped down as premier on February 1, 1917, handing over the reins of power to James Alexander Murray just before the general election. Clarke had been selected for appointment as the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor but was not able to accept the post due to poor health. Clarke died at home in St. Stephen a few weeks later.

<doc id="578631" wikidata="Q1063710" url="?curid=578631" title="High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection">
<text>High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a form of digital copy protection developed by Intel Corporation to prevent copying of digital audio and video content as it travels across connections. Types of connections include DisplayPort (DP), Digital Visual Interface (DVI), and High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), as well as less popular or now deprecated protocols like Gigabit Video Interface (GVIF) and Unified Display Interface (UDI).

The system is meant to stop HDCP-encrypted content from being played on unauthorized devices or devices which have been modified to copy HDCP content. Before sending data, a transmitting device checks that the receiver is authorized to receive it. If so, the transmitter encrypts the data to prevent eavesdropping as it flows to the receiver.

In order to make a device that plays HDCP-enabled content, the manufacturer must obtain a license for the patent from Intel subsidiary Digital Content Protection LLC, pay an annual fee, and submit to various conditions. For example, the device cannot be designed to copy; it must &quot;frustrate attempts to defeat the content protection requirements&quot;; it must not transmit high definition protected video to non-HDCP receivers; and DVD-Audio works can be played only at CD-audio quality by non-HDCP digital audio outputs (analog audio outputs have no quality limits). If the device has a feature like Intel Management Engine disabled, HDCP will not work.

Cryptanalysis researchers demonstrated flaws in HDCP as early as 2001. In September 2010, an HDCP master key that allows for the generation of valid device keys was released to the public, rendering the key revocation feature of HDCP useless. Intel has confirmed that the crack is real, and believes the master key was reverse engineered rather than leaked. In practical terms, the impact of the crack has been described as &quot;the digital equivalent of pointing a video camera at the TV&quot;, and of limited importance for consumers because the encryption of high-definition discs has been attacked directly, with the loss of interactive features like menus. Intel threatened to sue anyone producing an unlicensed device.

== Specification ==
HDCP uses three systems:
# Authentication prevents non-licensed devices from receiving content.
# Encryption of the data sent over DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, GVIF, or UDI interfaces prevents eavesdropping of information and man-in-the-middle attacks.
# Key revocation prevents devices that have been compromised and cloned from receiving data.

Each HDCP-capable device has a unique set of 40 56-bit keys. Failure to keep them secret violates the license agreement. For each set of values, a special private key called a KSV (Key Selection Vector) is created. Each KSV consists of 40 bits (one bit for each HDCP key), with 20 bits set to 0 and 20 bits set to 1.

During authentication, the parties exchange their KSVs under a procedure called Blom&#x27;s scheme. Each device adds its own secret keys together (using unsigned addition modulo 256) according to a KSV received from another device. Depending on the order of the bits set to 1 in the KSV, a corresponding secret key is used or ignored in the addition. The generation of keys and KSVs gives both devices the same 56-bit number, which is later used to encrypt data.

Encryption is done by a stream cipher. Each decoded pixel is encrypted by applying an XOR operation with a 24-bit number produced by a generator. The HDCP specifications ensure constant updating of keys after each encoded frame.

If a particular set of keys is compromised, their corresponding KSV is added to a revocation list burned onto new discs in the DVD and Blu-ray formats. (The lists are signed with a DSA digital signature, which is meant to keep malicious users from revoking legitimate devices.) During authentication, the transmitting device looks for the receiver&#x27;s KSV on the list, and if it is there, will not send the decrypted work to the revoked device.

== Uses ==

HDCP devices are generally divided into three categories:
;Source: The source sends the content to be displayed. Examples include set-top boxes, DVD, HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc players, and computer video cards. A source has only an HDCP/HDMI transmitter.
;Sink: The sink renders the content for display so it can be viewed. Examples include TVs and digital projectors. A sink has one or more HDCP/HDMI receivers.
;Repeater: A repeater accepts content, decrypts it, then re-encrypts and retransmits the data. It may perform some signal processing, such as upconverting video into a higher-resolution format, or splitting out the audio portion of the signal. Repeaters have HDMI inputs and outputs. Examples include home theater audio-visual receivers that separate and amplify the audio signal, while re-transmitting the video for display on a TV. A repeater could also simply send the input data stream to multiple outputs for simultaneous display on several screens.

Each device may contain one or more HDCP transmitters and/or receivers. (A single transmitter or receiver chip may combine HDCP and HDMI functionality.)

In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved HDCP as a &quot;Digital Output Protection Technology&quot; on 4 August 2004. The FCC&#x27;s Broadcast flag regulations, which were struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, would have required DRM technologies on all digital outputs from HDTV signal demodulators. Congress is still considering legislation that would implement something similar to the Broadcast Flag. The HDCP standard is more restrictive than the FCC&#x27;s Digital Output Protection Technology requirement. HDCP bans compliant products from converting HDCP-restricted content to full-resolution analog form, presumably in an attempt to reduce the size of the analog hole.

On 19 January 2005, the European Information, Communications, and Consumer Electronics Technology Industry Associations (EICTA) announced that HDCP is a required component of the European &quot;HD ready&quot; label.

Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows 7 both use HDCP in computer graphics cards and monitors.

== Circumvention ==
HDCP strippers decrypt the HDCP stream and transmit an unencrypted HDMI video signal so it will work in a non-HDCP display. It is currently unclear whether such devices would remain working if the HDCP licensing body issued key-revocation lists, which may be installed via new media (e.g. newer Blu-ray Discs) played-back by another device (e.g. a Blu-ray Disc player) connected to it.

=== Cryptanalysis ===
In 2001, Scott Crosby of Carnegie Mellon University wrote a paper with Ian Goldberg, Robert Johnson, Dawn Song, and David Wagner called &quot;A Cryptanalysis of the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection System&quot;, and presented it at ACM-CCS8 DRM Workshop on 5 November.

The authors concluded that HDCP&#x27;s linear key exchange is a fundamental weakness, and discussed ways to:
* Eavesdrop on any data.
* Clone any device with only its public key.
* Avoid any blacklist on devices.
* Create new device key vectors.
* In aggregate, usurp the authority completely.

They also said the Blom&#x27;s scheme key swap could be broken by a so-called &quot;conspiracy attack&quot;: obtaining the keys of at least 40 devices and reconstructing the secret symmetrical master matrix that was used to compute them.

Around the same time, Niels Ferguson independently claimed to have broken the HDCP scheme, but he did not publish his research, citing legal concerns arising from the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

In November 2011 Professor Tim Güneysu of Ruhr-Universität Bochum revealed he had broken the HDCP 1.3 encryption standard.

=== Master key release ===
On 14 September 2010, Engadget reported the release of a possible genuine HDCP master key which can create device keys that can authenticate with other HDCP compliant devices without obtaining valid keys from The Digital Content Protection LLC. This master key would neutralize the key revocation feature of HDCP, because new keys can be created when old ones are revoked. Since the master key is known, it follows that an unlicensed HDCP decoding device could simply use the master key to dynamically generate new keys on the fly, making revocation impossible. It was not immediately clear who discovered the key or how they discovered it, though the discovery was announced via a Twitter update which linked to a Pastebin snippet containing the key and instructions on how to use it. Engadget said the attacker may have used the method proposed by Crosby in 2001 to retrieve the master key, although they cited a different researcher. On 16 September, Intel confirmed that the code had been cracked. Intel has threatened legal action against anyone producing hardware to circumvent the HDCP, possibly under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
=== HDCP v2.2, v2.1 and v2.0 breach ===

In August 2012 version 2.1 was proved to be broken. The attack used the fact that the pairing process sends the &quot;Km&quot; key obfuscated with an XOR. That makes the encryptor (receiver) unaware of whether it encrypts or decrypts the key. Further, the input parameters for the XOR and the AES above it are fixed from the receiver side, meaning the transmitter can enforce repeating the same operation. Such a setting allows an attacker to monitor the pairing protocol, repeat it with a small change and extract the &quot;Km&quot; key. The small change is to pick the &quot;random&quot; key to be the encrypted key from the previous flow. Now, the attacker runs the protocol and in its pairing message it gets &quot;E(E(Km))&quot;. Since &quot;E()&quot; is based on XOR it undoes itself, thus exposing the &quot;Km&quot; of the legitimate device.

V2.2 was released to fix that weakness by adding randomness provided by the receiver side. However the transmitter in V2.2 must not support receivers of V2.1 or V2.0 in order to avoid this attack. Hence a new erratum was released to redefine the field called &quot;Type&quot; to prevent backward compatibility with versions below 2.2. The &quot;Type&quot; flag should be requested by the content&#x27;s usage rules (i.e. via the DRM or CAS that opened the content).

In August 2015, version 2.2 was rumored to be broken. An episode of AMC&#x27;s series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; was leaked to the Internet in UHD format; its metadata indicated it was an &quot;HDMI cap&quot;, meaning it was captured through HDMI interface that removed HDCP 2.2 protection.

On 4 November 2015, Chinese company LegendSky Tech Co., already known for their other HDCP rippers/splitters under the HDFury brand, released the HDFury Integral, a device that can remove HDCP 2.2 from HDCP-enabled UHD works. On 31 December 2015, Warner Bros and Digital Content Protection, LLC (DCP, the owners of HDCP) filed a lawsuit against LegendSky. Nevertheless, the lawsuit was ultimately dropped after LegendSky argued that the device did not &quot;strip&quot; HDCP content protection but rather downgraded it to an older version, a measure which is explicitly permitted in DCP&#x27;s licensing manual.

== Problems ==
HDCP can cause problems for users who want to connect multiple screens to a device; for example, a bar with several televisions connected to one satellite receiver or when a user has a closed laptop and uses an external display as the only monitor. HDCP devices can create multiple keys, allowing each screen to operate, but the number varies from device to device; e.g., a Dish or Sky satellite receiver can generate 16 keys. The technology sometimes causes handshaking problems where devices cannot establish a connection, especially with older high-definition displays.
Edward Felten wrote &quot;the main practical effect of HDCP has been to create one more way in which your electronics could fail to work properly with your TV,&quot; and concluded in the aftermath of the master key fiasco that HDCP has been &quot;less a security system than a tool for shaping the consumer electronics market.&quot;
Additional issues arise when interactive media (i.e. video games) suffer from control latency, because it requires additional processing for encoding/decoding. Various everyday usage situations, such as live streaming or capture of game play, are also adversely affected.
There is also the problem that all Apple laptop products, presumably in order to reduce switching time, when confronted with an HDCP-compliant sink device, automatically enable HDCP encryption from the HDMI / Mini DisplayPort / USB-C connector port. This is a problem if the user wishes to use recording or videoconferencing facilities further down the chain, because these devices most often do not decrypt HDCP-enabled content (since HDCP is meant to avoid direct copying of content, and such devices could conceivably do exactly that). This applies even if the output is not HDCP-requiring content, like a PowerPoint presentation or merely the device&#x27;s UI. Some sink devices have the ability to disable their HDCP reporting entirely, however, preventing this issue from blocking content to videoconferencing or recording. However, HDCP content will then refuse to play on many source devices if this is disabled while the sink device is connected.

When connecting a HDCP 2.2 source device through compatible distribution to a video wall made of multiple legacy displays the ability to display an image cannot be guaranteed.

== Versions ==
== HDCP v2.x ==
The 2.x version of HDCP is not a continuation of HDCPv1, and is rather a completely different link protection. Version 2.x employs industry-standard encryption algorithms, such as 128-bit AES with 3072 or 1024-bit RSA public key and 256-bit HMAC-SHA256 hash function. While all of the HDCP v1.x specifications support backward compatibility to previous versions of the specification, HDCPv2 devices may interface with HDCPv1 hardware only by natively supporting HDCPv1, or by using a dedicated converter device. This means that HDCPv2 is only applicable to new technologies. It has been selected for the WirelessHD and Miracast (formerly WiFi Display) standards.

HDCP 2.x features a new authentication protocol, and a locality check to ensure the receiver is relatively close (it must respond to the locality check within 7 ms on a normal DVI/HDMI link). Version 2.1 of the specification was cryptanalyzed and found to have several flaws, including the ability to recover the session key.

There are still a few commonalities between HDCP v2 and v1.
# Both are under DCP LLC authority.
# They share the same license agreement, compliance rules and robustness rules.
# They share the same revocation system and same device ID formats.

<text>Gregory Oliver Diamond (May 4, 1949 – March 14, 1999) was an American pianist, drummer, songwriter, and producer who was active in the jazz and disco music scenes of the 1970s.

==Career==
Diamond played drums and percussion for the Creatures, the backing band for Jobriath. He wrote &quot;Hot Butterfly&quot;, released in 1978 under one of his group&#x27;s names, Bionic Boogie. Luther Vandross provided lead vocals. The song was later covered by David Lasley, the Sweet Inspirations, and Chaka Khan.

His other popular songs included &quot;Risky Changes&quot; and &quot;Dance Little Dreamer&quot; (both released by Bionic Boogie in 1977), &quot;Cream (Always Rises to the Top)&quot; (released by Bionic Boogie in 1978), &quot;Starcruisin&#x27;&quot; (1978), &quot;Fancy Dancer&quot; (1978), and &quot;Tiger, Tiger (Feel Good For a While)&quot; (1979). &quot;Dance Little Dreamer&quot; reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart in 1978. &quot;Cream (Always Rises to the Top)&quot; reached #61 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1979.

Diamond&#x27;s association with Vandross came from the success of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Young Americans&quot; album, which included contributions by Vandross and Diamond&#x27;s brother Godfrey (his sound engineer). Diamond wrote and produced an album for TK Records recording artist George McCrae, scoring a club hit with &quot;Love in Motion&quot;.

His biggest commercial success was as writer and producer of the single &quot;More, More, More&quot; recorded by the Andrea True Connection in 1975. Diamond received a posthumous songwriting credit for Len&#x27;s 1999 hit &quot;Steal My Sunshine&quot;, which sampled &quot;More, More, More&quot;.

Diamond died of internal bleeding on March 14, 1999, at age 49.

<doc id="578635" wikidata="Q1345794" url="?curid=578635" title="James Darren">
<text>James William Ercolani (June 8, 1936 – September 2, 2024), known by his stage name James Darren, was an American television and film actor, television director, and singer. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he had notable starring and supporting roles in films including the youth and beach-culture film &quot;Gidget&quot; (1959) and its sequels. He also appeared in &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot; (1959), &quot;All the Young Men&quot; (1960), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), and &quot;Diamond Head&quot; (1962). As a teen pop singer, he sang hit singles including &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot; in 1961. He later became more active in television, starring as Dr. Anthony Newman in the science fiction series &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; (1966–1967). He had the regular role of Officer James Corrigan in the police drama &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; (1982–1986) and performed as Vic Fontaine, a recurring role in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (1998–1999).

== Early life ==
James William Ercolani was born in Philadelphia, on June 8, 1936. He was of Italian descent and grew up in South Philadelphia near where Fabian and Frankie Avalon lived. In an interview with the &quot;News Press&quot; of Fort Myers, Florida he said that the area where he lived was &quot;a real neighborhood. It made you feel that you could be successful, too.&quot; He mentioned that Al Martino and Eddie Fisher were from the neighborhood. 

Darren wanted to be an actor and studied in New York City with Stella Adler for a number of years. He also occasionally sang although he later said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really a singer. I was a kid in Philly whose dad would take him to bars and nightclubs and I would get up and sing two songs.&quot;

== Career ==
Darren was discovered by talent agent and casting director Joyce Selznick after he got some photographs taken by Maurice Seymour to show potential agents:

His secretary, a woman by the name of Yvonne Bouvier, asked me if I was interested in getting into film. I said yeah, I was. She said I know someone you should meet. She set up a meeting between me and Joyce Selznick, who worked for Screen Gems. I went down to 1650 Broadway, the Brill Building. On my way to a meeting with Joyce, we just happened to get on the elevator at the same time. She kept staring at me. I never met her. She never met me. We got off at the same floor and walked to the same office. That was our meeting. Joyce brought me over to Columbia Pictures about a week later and got me a contract there.

=== Columbia ===
Columbia signed Darren to a long-term contract in July 1956. A few weeks later he was filming his first film, &quot;Rumble on the Docks&quot; (1956), a low-budget &quot;B&quot; movie produced by Sam Katzman, where Darren played the lead. Darren&#x27;s appearance was well received and he got a lot of fan mail–second at the studio only to Kim Novak. He guest starred on an episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Web&quot; (&quot;Kill and Run&quot;) and then Columbia gave him a support role in an &quot;A&quot; picture, the comedy &quot;Operation Mad Ball&quot; (1957), starring Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs.

He had support roles in two films directed by Phil Karlson: &quot;The Brothers Rico&quot; (1957), a film noir, playing the brother of Richard Conte; and &quot;Gunman&#x27;s Walk&quot; (1958), a Western with Van Heflin and Tab Hunter. In between he was second billed in another movie for Katzman, &quot;The Tijuana Story&quot; (1957), although his role was relatively small.

=== &quot;Gidget&quot; and singing ===

Darren was third billed in the surf film, &quot;Gidget&quot; (1959), starring Sandra Dee and Cliff Robertson, playing Moondoggie, essentially the film&#x27;s leading man. He also sang the title track. &quot;They were thinking about having someone do the vocal and I would lip sync&quot;, he recalled. &quot;I told them I could do it. So we went into one of the sound stages and I sang &#x27;Gidget&#x27;. They said, &#x27;He sings fine,&#x27; then I did all the other songs.&quot;

The film was a hit with teen audiences and so was the song. Darren wound up recording a string of pop hits for Colpix Records, the biggest of which was &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot; (No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1961). It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. He also recorded this song in Italian, as &quot;Addio Mondo Crudele&quot;, which was very successful in Europe. His follow-ups also became hits: &quot;Her Royal Majesty&quot; (No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1962) and &quot;Conscience&quot; (No. 11, 1962). He is also featured in one of the Scopitone series of pop-music video jukebox films (&quot;Because You&#x27;re Mine&quot;).

Twice, in 1959 and 1961, Darren played teen idols on episodes of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;. He did an episode of &quot;The Lineup&quot; (1959). He was third billed in a series of films for Columbia: &quot;The Gene Krupa Story&quot; (1959), a biopic with Sal Mineo; &quot;All the Young Men&quot; (1960), a Korean War movie with Alan Ladd and Sidney Poitier; and &quot;Let No Man Write My Epitaph&quot; (1960) with Burl Ives and Shelley Winters, which was a sequel to &quot;Knock on Any Door&quot; (1949). He had a cameo as himself in a teen film, &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot; (1960), singing the title track.

Darren had a supporting role in the World War II film &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), a huge hit at the box office. However, he later said &quot;The people handling my career at that point didn&#x27;t really take advantage of it.&quot; Also popular was &quot;Gidget Goes Hawaiian&quot; (1961) where Darren reprised his role as Moondoggie; he had a new Gidget (Deborah Walley) and was given top billing.

Darren had a good support role in a melodrama, &quot;Diamond Head&quot; (1962) with Charlton Heston. He played Moondoggie a third time in &quot;Gidget Goes to Rome&quot; (1962) which he later said he &quot;hated... I didn&#x27;t want to do it. I thought that I&#x27;d be doing those for the rest of my life.&quot; He told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2024, &quot;They (Columbia Pictures) had me under contract; I was a prisoner. But with those young ladies (Sandra Dee, Deborah Walley, and Cindy Carol), it was the best prison I think I&#x27;ll ever be in.&quot; 

He sang the title track for &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot; (1963). He also did voice-over work for Screen Gems&#x27; Hanna-Barbera animation unit. He was caricatured as teen idol &quot;Jimmy Darrock&quot; on an episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, and was the singing voice of Yogi Bear in the theatrical feature, &quot;Hey There, It&#x27;s Yogi Bear!&quot; (released 1964), on the song &quot;Ven-e, Ven-o, Ven-a&quot;. Darren&#x27;s seven-year contract with Columbia expired in 1963, and he did not renew it. His recording agreement with Colpix remained in force, and Colpix issued new records into 1965. In the same year he changed labels, signing with Warner Bros. Records where he had a Top-40 hit (&quot;All&quot;, No. 35, 1967).

=== Universal ===
In 1963 Darren signed a seven-picture deal with Universal, starting with &quot;The Lively Set&quot; (1963). That teamed him with Pamela Tiffin, who was also in &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; (1964), a teen film Darren made for United Artists. Nancy Sinatra appeared in the movie as well. Darren was the godfather of Nancy&#x27;s daughter, AJ Lambert.

=== Irwin Allen ===

Darren guest-starred on an episode of Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. Allen then cast Darren in the lead of a series, as impulsive scientist and adventurer Tony Newman on the science fiction series &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; (1966–1967) with Robert Colbert and Lee Meriwether. When the series ended, Allen shot a pilot for a new series starring Darren, &quot;The Man from the 25th Century&quot;, but it was not picked up.

Darren went to Europe to make &quot;Venus in Furs&quot; (1969) for Jess Franco and was reunited with Allen in &quot;City Beneath the Sea&quot; (1971).

=== TV guest star ===
In the 1970s, Darren performed regularly in night clubs. He focused on guest starring on TV series, such as &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; &quot;S.W.A.T.,&quot; &quot;Police Woman,&quot; &quot;Black Sheep Squadron,&quot; &quot;The Feather &amp; Father Gang,&quot; &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels,&quot; &quot;Police Story,&quot; &quot;Hawaii Five-O,&quot; &quot;Vegas,&quot; &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

He had a role in the TV movie &quot;The Lives of Jenny Dolan&quot; (1975) and the film &quot;The Boss&#x27; Son&quot; (1978). In the early 1980s Darren appeared on &quot;Scruples&quot; (1981) and &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;.

=== &quot;Portrait of a Legend&quot; ===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Darren was the host of &quot;Portrait of a Legend&quot;, a weekly show in which he conducted an interview with a popular musician about their career interspersed with classic performance footage of that artist. Artists who appeared included Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, Sly Stone, and Herb Alpert. The show appeared mostly on PBS.

=== &quot;TJ Hooker&quot; and directing ===

From 1983 to 1986 Darren had a regular role as Officer James Corrigan on the television police drama &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;. &quot;Every career has its hills and valleys&quot;, Darren said in 1983. &quot;The most important thing is that you are happy with you. Not anybody&#x27;s career, no one that I know of, has always been climbing. It always levels out and you want to make sure you have good investments and financial security and bread on the table. If projects aren&#x27;t coming to you, then you seek them out and you try to develop and put projects together.&quot;

He directed some episodes and launched a career as a director, notably of action-based series, including &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot;, &quot;Silk Stalkings&quot;, &quot;Renegade&quot;, and &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; as well as dramas such as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. He continued to act on such shows as &quot;Raven&quot;.

=== &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; ===
In 1998, Darren achieved popularity anew as a singer through his appearances on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; in the role of holographic crooner and adviser Vic Fontaine. His role in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; inspired his return to singing. Many of his vocal performances on the show were re-recorded for the album &quot;This One&#x27;s from the Heart&quot; (1999). The album shows Darren, a close friend of Frank Sinatra, singing in the Sinatra style. The 2001 follow-up &quot;Because of You&quot; showed similar inspiration from Tony Bennett.

Darren&#x27;s later appearances include &quot;Random Acts&quot; (2001) and &quot;Lucky&quot; (2017).

== Personal life and death ==

In 1955, Darren married Gloria Terlitsky, his sweetheart since 1953. Her father opposed their marriage because Terlitsky was Jewish while Darren was Roman Catholic. Darren and Terlitsky had a son, James Jr. (&quot;Jimmy&quot;), and divorced in 1958. Jimmy was adopted by Gloria&#x27;s third husband and is now known as Jim Moret, a journalist and television commentator.

Two years after the divorce, Darren married Evy Norlund, Miss Denmark 1958. They had two sons, Christian (born c. 1960) and Anthony (born c. 1964).

Darren died from congestive heart failure in his sleep, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, on September 2, 2024. He was 88. In the weeks before his death, Darren was experiencing issues relating to the function of his aortic valve. His doctors judged his condition too fragile to undergo surgery and repair it.

<text>The International Association of Gay Square Dance Clubs (or IAGSDC) is an international umbrella organization for gay square dance. The association includes over eighty clubs. Most clubs are in the United States and Canada, with one club in Japan. There are no longer any active clubs in Britain, Denmark, or Australia.

==Annual conventions==
An annual convention is held usually in early July drawing gay and lesbian dancers, their partners and other friendly square dancers from around the world. In addition to 4 days of dancing to top callers, other highlights of the conventions include &quot;The Honky Tonk Queen Contest&quot;— a ribald country-western drag queen contest and show, the &quot;Fun Badge Tour&quot;&quot;— a bus tour of the hosting town with stops to square dance at the most unexpected places, and the convention banquet. Peter Lawlor from Neasden and his Kingsbury lover Nick Gaul are known to be founding members.

At the 2010 IAGSDC Convention held in Chicago over 4 July weekend, an IAGSDC History Wiki was unveiled.

<doc id="578648" wikidata="Q1685123" url="?curid=578648" title="The Trammps">
<text>The Trammps are an American disco and soul band, who were based in Philadelphia and were one of the first disco bands.

The band&#x27;s first major success was their 1972 cover version of &quot;Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart&quot;, while the first disco track they released was &quot;Love Epidemic&quot; in 1973. However, they are best known for their song &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; which was included on the Grammy-winning &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack. When originally released in 1976, &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; became a UK pop hit and US R&amp;B and Dance hit topping the Dance chart for 6 weeks in early 1977. After inclusion on the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack, the song was re-released in 1978 and became a US pop hit peaking at number 11.

==History==
===1970s===
The history of the Trammps grew from the 1960s group the Volcanos, who later became the Moods. With a number of line-up changes by the early 1970s, the band membership included gospel-influenced lead singer Jimmy Ellis, drummer and singer (bass voice) Earl Young, with brothers Stanley and Harold &#x27;Doc&#x27; Wade. Members of the Philadelphia recording band MFSB played with the group on records and on tour in the 1970s with singer Robert Upchurch joining later. The group was produced by the Philadelphia team of Ronnie Baker, Norman Harris and Young, all MFSB mainstays who played on the recording sessions and contributed songs.

Their debut chart entry came via an upbeat cover version of the standard &quot;Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart&quot;, featuring Young&#x27;s bass voice, which became a top 20 US R&amp;B chart hit in 1972.

Their first few recordings were released on Buddah Records, including &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot;, which was a hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1973, before a re-release saw it climb in the UK two years later. Several R&amp;B hits followed during a stay with Philadelphia International subsidiary Golden Fleece (run by Baker-Harris-Young) before they signed to Atlantic Records. 
Their single &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; (1976), which was included on the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Saturday Night Fever: The Original Movie Sound Track&quot; in 1977, reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in May 1978.

Other major hits included &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; (1975) (UK No. 5) and &quot;That&#x27;s Where the Happy People Go&quot; (1976). In late 1977, the Trammps released the song &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out&quot; to commemorate the electrical blackout that affected New York City on July 13–14, 1977.

Their signature song &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; has been covered by Tina Turner and Cyndi Lauper. In addition, Graham Parker covered &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; on &quot;The Pink Parker EP&quot; in 1977, and reached No. 24 in the UK Singles Chart, and top 60 in the US. In 2021, &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry, together with &quot;Can We Come Together&quot; (from the album &quot;Where the Happy People Go&quot;).

===Dissolution and aftermath===
On September 19, 2005, the group&#x27;s &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; was inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame at a ceremony held in New York. The song was part-written by Ron Kersey, a producer-arranger and a member of MFSB, who also played with the Trammps in the 1970s for a time. During the ceremony, the original band members performed together for the first time in 25 years. Disco Inferno has also had a resurgence and has garnered new fans with the 2016 presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in the USA due to the song&#x27;s refrain of &quot;burn, baby, burn&quot; (slightly altered to &quot;Bern, baby, Bern&quot;).

By 2007, two versions of the group, with differing line-ups, toured the nostalgia circuit.

On March 8, 2012, lead singer Jimmy Ellis died at a nursing home in Rock Hill, South Carolina (where he was born on November 15, 1937), at the age of 74. The cause of death was not immediately known but he suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

The music journalist Ron Wynn noted: &quot;the Trammps&#x27; prowess can&#x27;t be measured by chart popularity; Ellis&#x27; booming, joyous vocals brilliantly championed the celebratory fervor and atmosphere that made disco both loved and hated among music fans.&quot;

On June 30, 2019, the Trammps appeared on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, Season 2, episode 4 entitled &quot;She Knows&quot;.

Stan Wade died in January 2021.

<doc id="578650" wikidata="Q643614" url="?curid=578650" title="Scholz conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Scholz conjecture is a conjecture on the length of certain addition chains.
It is sometimes also called the Scholz–Brauer conjecture or the Brauer–Scholz conjecture, after Arnold Scholz who formulated it in 1937 and Alfred Brauer who studied it soon afterward and proved a weaker bound.

Neill Clift has announced an example showing that the bound of the conjecture is not always tight.

==Statement==
The conjecture states that
where is the length of the shortest addition chain producing &quot;n&quot;.

Here, an addition chain is defined as a sequence of numbers, starting with 1, such that every number after the first can be expressed as a sum of two earlier numbers (which are allowed to both be equal). Its length is the number of sums needed to express all its numbers, which is one less than the length of the sequence of numbers (since there is no sum of previous numbers for the first number in the sequence, 1). Computing the length of the shortest addition chain that contains a given number can be done by dynamic programming for small numbers, but it is not known whether it can be done in polynomial time measured as a function of the length of the binary representation of . Scholz&#x27;s conjecture, if true, would provide short addition chains for numbers of a special form, the Mersenne numbers.

==Example==
As an example, : it has a shortest addition chain
:1, 2, 4, 5
of length three, determined by the three sums
:1 + 1 = 2,
:2 + 2 = 4,
:4 + 1 = 5.
Also, : it has a shortest addition chain
:1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 31
of length seven, determined by the seven sums
:1 + 1 = 2,
:2 + 1 = 3,
:3 + 3 = 6,
:6 + 6 = 12,
:12 + 12 = 24,
:24 + 6 = 30,
:30 + 1 = 31.
Both and equal 7.
Therefore, these values obey the inequality (which in this case is an equality) and the Scholz conjecture is true for the case .

==Partial results==
By using a combination of computer search techniques and mathematical characterizations of optimal addition chains, showed that the conjecture is true for all . Additionally, he verified that for all , the inequality of the conjecture is actually an equality.

The bound of the conjecture is not always an exact equality. For instance, for formula_1, formula_2, with formula_3.

<text>Joseph Atallah Ghiz (January 27, 1945 – November 9, 1996) was a Canadian politician and lawyer. He was the 27th premier of Prince Edward Island from 1986 to 1993, and was a justice of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island from 1995 until his death in 1996. He was the father of Robert Ghiz, the 31st premier of Prince Edward Island. Ghiz was the first premier of a Canadian province to be of non-European descent, since followed by Ujjal Dosanjh and Ghiz&#x27;s son, Robert.

==Early life and family==
Ghiz was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, to Atallah Joseph Ghiz, a Lebanese corner store owner, and Marguerite F. Ghiz (née McKarris). Ghiz was a graduate of Dalhousie and Harvard law schools and was a Charlottetown lawyer before entering into politics.

==CBA Committee on the Constitution==
Ghiz was active in the Canadian Bar Association. In 1977, in the aftermath of the election of the separatist Parti Québécois government in 1976, he was asked to sit on the CBA Committee on the Constitution. The mandate of the Committee was to study and make recommendations on the Constitution of Canada. The members of the Committee were drawn from each province of Canada, and included two future provincial premiers (Ghiz and Clyde Wells), a future Supreme Court of Canada justice, two future provincial chief justices, and a future Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations. The Committee presented its report to the CBA at the next annual meeting, in 1978. The Committee made wide-ranging recommendations for constitutional change, including a completely new constitution, abolishing the monarchy, changing the Senate, entrenching language rights and a bill of rights, and changing the balance of powers between the federal government and the provinces.

==Political career==
He became president of the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party in 1977 and then party leader in 1981. His party lost the 1982 election but Ghiz was elected to the legislature and became leader of the opposition. He led the party to victory in 1986 with the Liberals gaining 20 seats to 11 for the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island.

In January 1988, Ghiz declared that Islanders would vote in a plebiscite on the question of a &quot;fixed link&quot; to mainland Canada - probably the single most divisive topic in Prince Edward Island during the latter part of the 20th century. Ghiz later in life reported to have voted against the fixed link on his personal vote.

Ghiz supported the Meech Lake Accord and opposed the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement. His participation in both debates made him a national figure. His government was re-elected in 1989 winning 30 out of 32 seats; it is speculated that this was in reaction to the federal PC government of Brian Mulroney&#x27;s decision to close CFB Summerside. Ghiz&#x27;s government subsequently accepted a $200 million funding agreement for highway construction in exchange for the provincial government allowing the federal Crown corporation CN Rail to abandon railway service in the province.

Ghiz favoured concessions to Quebec in constitutional negotiations and campaigned for the Charlottetown Accord, resigning three months after the accord was defeated in a 1992 referendum.

==Later life==
Following his decision to leave politics, Ghiz served as dean of his alma mater, the Dalhousie Law School until 1995, when he was appointed as a justice to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island. Ghiz died of cancer in 1996. Several weeks before his death, he was driven by construction personnel across the largest completed section of the Confederation Bridge which had yet to be connected to the North American mainland.

His son Robert, served as the 31st premier of Prince Edward Island from June 12, 2007 to February 23, 2015 (leader of the PEI Liberal Party, 2003–2015). This was the second time in the history of Prince Edward Island that a father-son team both served as premier, the other pair (also Liberal) being Thane Campbell (1936–1943) and his son Alexander B. Campbell (1966–1978).

It has also been marketed as the [[Fiat Talento]], the Nissan NV300, the Nissan Primastar and the Mitsubishi Express. Until 2019, it was also sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro (briefly sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Arena earlier) by Opel and its associated company Vauxhall. From early 2022 onwards, the van is also marketed by Renault Trucks as the Renault Trucks Trafic. 

Previous versions of the Renault Trafic have been sold under Inokom, Chevrolet and Tata badges.

The second generation Vauxhall/Opel Vivaro was produced in GM Manufacturing Luton and in Sandouville Renault Factory plant starting in 2014. However, following the takeover of Opel/Vauxhall by Groupe PSA, the Trafic-based Vivaro went out of production in 2019, and was replaced by the next generation Vivaro based on the Citroën Jumpy EMP2 Platform for the 2020 model year.


== First generation (1980)==
The original Renault Trafic was sold from 1980 to 2001 and was somewhat revised and updated during its lifetime.

Originally, the van had some variations in the front end shape depending on which engine was fitted, with the original 1397 cc motor fitting behind a flat grille, and the 2.1-litre diesel engine and larger 1647 cc petrol engines requiring an extended plastic grille and deeper bumper.

The 1721 cc OHC engine replaced the 1647 cc OHV unit in the mid 1980s, which fitted under the shorter grille, but required a small lump in the bonnet. The diesel and 2.2-litre petrol carried on with the extended grille.

In the end of 1984, a four-wheel drive version was introduced. This was a part time system coupled with the diesel engine and a five speed manual transmission. This model operated as a front wheel drive until the rear wheels were engaged with a dog clutch, a system similar to the one used by Renault on the R18 4x4.

In May 1989, the Trafic underwent a major front end facelift, with a rounder shape and a plastic bumper, and the new longer body shape covering all varieties of engine. In 1995, the Mk1 Trafic got its final facelift, with a new grille, new tail lights, large double rear view mirrors, and a new interior with a modern dashboard and multi adjustable seats.

===Winnebago===
The chassis and cab of the 1980s models were used as the base vehicle by Winnebago Industries to build the Winnebago &#x27;LeSharo&#x27; from 1983, and Itasca Phasar.

For the chassis and cab version to meet safety and emission requirements in the United States, this version was sold with Renault&#x27;s J7T gasoline engine, and 2.1-litre diesel and turbo diesel engines, coded as J8S and shared with the 1985 to 1987 AMC/Jeep Cherokee/Commanche.

Jeep versions used the Garrett T2 turbocharger while Winnebagos received the larger T3 type. CARB granted a series of yearly waivers to Winnebago for non compliance in omitting On Board Diagnostics (OBD I), these waivers remained in effect throughout the model run from 1983 to 1992.

===Campervan Variants===
The Mk1 Trafic became popular for professional conversion into budget family motorhomes due to the flexibility of the design and the generous internal space for what was a relatively small van. Popular converters were &quot;Auto Sleepers&quot; and &quot;Holdsworth&quot; (now defunct). Other motorhome builders using the Trafic Mk1 as a base include Hymer, Elddis, Eriba, and Autostar.

===Opel Arena===
From 1997 to 2001, the Renault Trafic was marketed as the Opel Arena in Germany and as the Vauxhall Arena in the United Kingdom. Nick Reilly, Vauxhall&#x27;s chairman and managing director commented that the Arena marked the first time the company could offer a total commercial range ever since the days of the old Bedford CF, which ended production in 1986.

===Tata Winger===

In June 2007, Tata Motors announced the introduction of the Winger, a panel van and minibus based on the 1995 to 2001 version of the Renault Trafic, but fitted with Tata&#x27;s own two litre diesel engines, with or without turbo.

===Inokom Permas===
The Inokom Permas was launched in Malaysia in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inokom Permas launch 07/1998 library.perdana.org.my&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the van was at Kulim District.

===South America===
For South America, the vehicle was made in the Renault Argentina facility at Santa Isabel, Córdoba. In Brazil, it was badged as Chevrolet Trafic and later as the Renault Trafic or Chevrolet SpaceVan. A pickup version was sold as the Renault Trafic Rodeo. Production ended in 2002.

== Second generation (X83; 2001)==
The second Trafic resulted from a joint venture between German Opel, Japanese Nissan, and French Renault. It is also sold as an Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro and Nissan Primastar.

Designed by Renault&#x27;s corporate design department based within the company&#x27;s Technocentre outside Paris, the Trafic was developed by the engineering team of Renault&#x27;s light commercial vehicle unit at Villiers-Saint-Frédéric. Manufactured by GM Manufacturing Luton at its plant in Luton — beside Primastar and the Vivaro — the Trafic was the first Renault vehicle to be built in the United Kingdom in more than thirty years.

In an agreement between Renault and Nissan, versions of the van are also manufactured at Nissan&#x27;s plant in Barcelona, Spain. In particular, high roof versions for Opel, Vauxhall, Renault, and Nissan are made in Barcelona because the Luton assembly plant has a low roof which cannot accommodate the extra height of the high roof.

The van exists in several versions, from a three seater with all the rear space available for loads, to a nine seater, also known as a &quot;Passenger van&quot;. Its name is based on the French word for &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;traffic&quot; (depending on the context). The van was designed by Renault in Paris, and both Renault-Nissan and Opel/Vauxhall versions are manufactured by Opel/Vauxhall at their plant in Luton. In 2012, production of the Vauxhall Vivaro totalled 36,982 and 16,483 for the Renault Trafic.

A mild facelift in October 2006 had the orange indicators swapped for clear ones, which were more integrated into the headlamp housings. On the Opel/Vauxhall model, the indicators moved from the front bumpers, up into the headlamp housings, thus looking more similar to the Renault one. Production ended in June 2015.

===Nissan Primastar===
The Nissan Primastar was also launched in 2001, and is available in panel van, combi, bus, and chassis cab configurations. Two wheelbases and two roof heights are available, as well as three diesel engines and a petrol one. In the end of 2014, the last Primastar rolled off the production line. It was replaced by the NV300 in September 2016.

===Opel Vivaro A===
The Opel Vivaro from the German automaker Opel was launched in September 2001. While the Vivaro is sold as an Opel in most European markets, in the United Kingdom it was sold as a Vauxhall. The Vivaro is primarily manufactured at GM Manufacturing Luton (previously IBC) in Luton, England and by Nissan at their Zona Franca (Barcelona) facility in Spain.

The Vivaro is available in panel van, minibus, combined bus/van, and platform crew cab configurations. Two different wheelbase styles, and two roof height options are also available, as well as three diesel engine power options and a petrol engine.

The vehicle was given a mild facelift in 2006, during which the front indicators were moved from the front bumper, up into the headlight housing and only a 2.0 L four cylinder diesel engine is available in two states of tune; a or mated to a six speed manual or optional automatic transmission.

The Vivaro e Concept debuted September 2010 at the IAA Commercial Vehicle Show in Hanover, Germany. It is plug in hybrid vehicle, with an extended range up to and includes 21 kWh lithium ion batteries enabling over of pure electric driving range.

== Third generation (X82; 2014)==
Renault released a new generation Trafic in September 2014. It was again rebadged and sold as the Opel Vivaro in Europe and Vauxhall Vivaro in the UK. Styling was updated for the 2019 model year and again for the 2021 model year, then in 2024 with the new Renault logo.

Two lower power variants (95 PS and 115 PS) use a variable geometry turbocharger, while the highest output (125 PS and 145 PS) variant employs a twin turbocharger arrangement; other features include variable output water and oil pumps and a maintenance free timing chain.

===Rebadged variants===
Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro variants for the United Kingdom and mainland Europe were manufactured at GM Manufacturing Luton and at Sandouville, except for the high roof variants and the left-hand drive variants, which were manufactured at Sandouville. The new Vivaro dropped the previous larger capacity diesel engines, in favour of a 1.6 Energy dCi (Renault/Renault Trucks/Nissan/)/CDTI (Opel/Vauxhall)/MultiJet (Fiat)/Di-D (Mitsubishi) engine. From 2016, Vauxhall Vivaro models gained a &quot;Made In Britain&quot; badge at the rear. The Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro went out of production in 2019, when Opel/Vauxhall was acquired by Groupe PSA; it was replaced by a new generation Vivaro which was a rebadged Citroën Jumpy for the model year of 2019.

Renault–Nissan Alliance partner Nissan sold a rebadged Trafic II (X83) as the Primastar. The Primastar was renamed to the NV300 for 2016 and moved to the Trafic III (X82). The light commercial vehicle variant of the NV300 reverted to using the Primastar nameplate in 2021.

In July 2016, Fiat introduced a rebadged Trafic, called Talento to replace its Scudo, which had been a rebadged Citroën Jumpy. In October 2019, all of the vans were given a facelift which introduced a new 2.0-litre EcoJet diesel engine which is 11 percent more fuel efficient than the older 1.6 litre and variable-geometry turbocharger for smoother engine performance at low speeds. Small exterior changes include revised front bumper and black plastic wing mirrors instead of painted ones. Interior received a updated steering wheel, textured crash pads on the dashboard, new choice of interior trims and 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto supported. In September 2020, Renault announced it would stop supplying Talentos to Fiat, as Fiat Chrysler had declared plans to merge with Renault&#x27;s rival Groupe PSA to form Stellantis. The Talento was replaced by a new Scudo/Ulysses, which was again a rebadged Jumpy.

In 2020, the Trafic was rebadged and introduced as the third-generation Mitsubishi Express for Australia, and as a replacement for the former L300 in the New Zealand market.
It was discontinued two years later. The existing Renault Trafic has also been sold in these markets since 2014.

In 2022, Renault starts to supply the Trafic to Renault Trucks (company owned by Volvo AB) to sell Trafics on its dealerships using the Renault Trucks badging.

===Models===
====Trafic Formula Edition====

Launched in 2018, the Formula Edition was available on the Trafic alongside the Kangoo and Master, and featured a new paint and wheels, plus black and yellow trim.
====Trafic X-Track====
Launched in 2016, the Trafic X-Track is a front-wheel drive offroad version of the Trafic.

====Trafic Van E-Tech====

The 100% electric Trafic was officially presented at the 2022 IAA. It is equipped with a electric traction motor drawing from the same 52 kW-hr battery as the larger electric Master E-Tech, giving a WLTP range of . The van can accept charging power of up to 7 kW (single-phase AC) or 22 kW (three-phase AC), and a fast-charging option (50 kW DC) is available. A passenger van variant may be based on the Hippie Caviar Hotel concept shown in 2021.

<doc id="578656" wikidata="Q4681316" url="?curid=578656" title="Addition chain">
<text>In mathematics, an addition chain for computing a positive integer can be given by a sequence of natural numbers starting with 1 and ending with , such that each number in the sequence is the sum of two previous numbers. The &quot;length&quot; of an addition chain is the number of sums needed to express all its numbers, which is one less than the cardinality of the sequence of numbers.

==Examples==
As an example: (1,2,3,6,12,24,30,31) is an addition chain for 31 of length 7, since
:2 = 1 + 1
:3 = 2 + 1
:6 = 3 + 3
:12 = 6 + 6
:24 = 12 + 12
:30 = 24 + 6
:31 = 30 + 1

Addition chains can be used for addition-chain exponentiation. This method allows exponentiation with integer exponents to be performed using a number of multiplications equal to the length of an addition chain for the exponent. For instance, the addition chain for 31 leads to a method for computing the 31st power of any number using only seven multiplications, instead of the 30 multiplications that one would get from repeated multiplication, and eight multiplications with exponentiation by squaring:
:2 = × 
:3 = 2 × 
:6 = 3 × 3
:12 = 6 × 6
:24 = 12 × 12
:30 = 24 × 6
:31 = 30 × 

==Methods for computing addition chains==
Calculating an addition chain of minimal length is not easy; a generalized version of the problem, in which one must find a chain that simultaneously forms each of a sequence of values, is NP-complete. There is no known algorithm which can calculate a minimal addition chain for a given number with any guarantees of reasonable timing or small memory usage. However, several techniques are known to calculate relatively short chains that are not always optimal.

One very well known technique to calculate relatively short addition chains is the &quot;binary method&quot;, similar to exponentiation by squaring. In this method, an addition chain for the number formula_1 is obtained recursively, from an addition chain for formula_2. If formula_1 is even, it can be obtained in a single additional sum, as formula_4. If formula_1 is odd, this method uses two sums to obtain it, by computing formula_6 and then adding one.

The &quot;factor method&quot; for finding addition chains is based on the prime factorization of the number formula_1 to be represented. If formula_1 has a number formula_9 as one of its prime factors, then an addition chain for formula_1 can be obtained by starting with a chain for formula_11, and then concatenating onto it a chain for formula_9, modified by multiplying each of its numbers by formula_11. The ideas of the factor method and binary method can be combined into &quot;Brauer&#x27;s m-ary method&quot; by choosing any number formula_14 (regardless of whether it divides formula_1), recursively constructing a chain for formula_16, concatenating a chain for formula_14 (modified in the same way as above) to obtain formula_18, and then adding the remainder. Additional refinements of these ideas lead to a family of methods called &quot;sliding window methods&quot;.

==Chain length==
Let formula_19 denote the smallest formula_20 so that there exists an addition chain
of length formula_20 which computes formula_1.
It is known that
formula_23
formula_24
where formula_25 is the Hamming weight (the number of ones) of the binary expansion of formula_1.

One can obtain an addition chain for formula_27 from an addition chain for formula_1 by including one additional sum formula_29, from which follows the inequality formula_30 on the lengths of the chains for formula_1 and formula_27. However, this is not always an equality,
as in some cases formula_27 may have a shorter chain than the one obtained in this way. For instance, formula_34, observed by Knuth. It is even possible for formula_27 to have a shorter chain than formula_1, so that formula_37; the smallest formula_1 for which this happens is formula_39, which is followed by formula_40, formula_41, and so on .

==Brauer chain==
A Brauer chain or star addition chain is an addition chain in which each of the sums used to calculate its numbers uses the immediately previous number. A Brauer number is a number for which a Brauer chain is optimal.

Brauer proved that
where is the length of the shortest star chain. For many values of formula_1, and in particular for formula_43, they are equal: . But Hansen showed that there are some values of &quot;n&quot; for which , such as which has . The smallest such &quot;n&quot; is 12509.

==Scholz conjecture==

The Scholz conjecture (sometimes called the &quot;Scholz–Brauer&quot; or &quot;Brauer–Scholz conjecture&quot;), named after Arnold Scholz and Alfred T. Brauer), is a conjecture from 1937 stating that
:formula_44

This inequality is known to hold for all Hansen numbers, a generalization of Brauer numbers; Neill Clift checked by computer that all formula_45 are Hansen (while 5784689 is not). Clift further verified that in fact formula_46 for all formula_47.

<doc id="578664" wikidata="Q1468572" url="?curid=578664" title="Violin Concerto (Sibelius)">
<text>The Violin Concerto in D minor, Op. 47 of Jean Sibelius, originally composed in 1904 and revised in 1905, is the only concerto by Sibelius. It is symphonic in scope and included an extended cadenza for the soloist that takes on the role of the development section in the first movement.

== History ==
Sibelius originally dedicated the concerto to the noted violinist Willy Burmester, who promised to play the concerto in Berlin. For financial reasons, however, Sibelius decided to premiere it in Helsinki, and since Burmester was unavailable to travel to Finland, Sibelius engaged (1873–1914), a Hungarian violin pedagogue of Czech origin who was then teaching at the Helsinki Institute of Music (now the Sibelius Academy).

The initial version of the concerto premiered on 8 February 1904, with Sibelius conducting. Sibelius had barely finished the work in time for the premiere, giving Nováček little time to prepare, and the piece was of such difficulty that it would have sorely tested even a player of much greater skill. Given these factors, it was unwise of Sibelius to choose Nováček, who was a teacher and not a recognised soloist, and it is not surprising that the premiere was a disaster. However, Nováček was not the poor player he is sometimes painted as. He was the first violinist hired by Martin Wegelius for the Helsinki Institute, and in 1910 he participated in the premiere of Sibelius&#x27;s string quartet &quot;Voces intimae&quot;, which received favourable reviews.

Sibelius withheld this version from publication and made substantial revisions. He deleted much material he felt did not work. The new version premiered on 19 October 1905 with Richard Strauss conducting the Berlin Court Orchestra. Sibelius was not in attendance. Willy Burmester was again asked to be the soloist, but he was again unavailable, so the performance went ahead without him, the orchestra&#x27;s leader Karel Halíř stepping into the soloist&#x27;s shoes. Burmester was so offended that he refused ever to play the concerto, and Sibelius re-dedicated it to the Hungarian &quot;wunderkind&quot; Ferenc von Vecsey, who was aged 12 at the time. Vecsey championed the work, first performing it when he was only 13, although he could not adequately cope with the extraordinary technical demands of the work.

The initial version was noticeably more demanding on the advanced skills of the soloist. The revised version still requires a high level of technical facility on the part of the soloist. The original is somewhat longer than the revised, including themes that did not survive the revision. Certain parts, like the very beginning, most of the third movement, and parts of the second, have not changed at all. The cadenza in the first movement is exactly the same for the violin part.

===Recent history of the 1904 version===
The Sibelius family has granted occasional permission for a small number of orchestras and soloists to perform the original 1904 version in public. The first such documented authorisation was for a September 1990 performance by Manfred Gräsbeck, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra and Osmo Vänskä. In January 1991, BIS made a commercial recording of the original 1904 version, with Leonidas Kavakos, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra and Vänskä. Subsequent performances of the 1904 version have been as follows:
* 3 September 2015: Elina Vähälä, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Hannu Lintu (conductor)
* 28 November 2015: Maxim Vengerov, Queensland Symphony Orchestra, Nicholas Carter (conductor)
* 5 June 2016: Maxim Vengerov, Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra, Marios Papadopoulos (conductor) (The Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, UK)
* 6 June 2016: Maxim Vengerov, Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra, Marios Papadopoulos (conductor) (Barbican Centre, London)
* 5 and 6 October 2016: Maxim Vengerov, Orchestre de Paris, Christoph Eschenbach (conductor).
* 7 and 8 January 2022: Elina Vähälä, Minnesota Orchestra, Osmo Vänskä (conductor)
* 30 and 31 March 2023: Elina Vähälä, Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra, Osmo Vänskä (conductor)
In 2020, Robert Lienau Musikverlag produced the first published version of the original 1904 version of the Violin Concerto.

== Music ==
This is the only concerto that Sibelius wrote, though he composed several other smaller-scale pieces for solo instrument and orchestra, including the six Humoresques for violin and orchestra.

One noteworthy feature of the work is the way in which an extended cadenza for the soloist takes on the role of the development section in the sonata form first movement. Much of the violin writing is purely virtuosic, but even the most showy passages alternate with the melodic. 

This concerto is generally symphonic in scope, departing completely from the often lighter, &quot;rhythmic&quot; accompaniments of many other concertos. Donald Tovey regarded the concerto as an unparalleled example of this styling and wrote that he had &quot;not met a more original, a more masterly, and a more exhilarating work than the Sibelius violin concerto&quot;.

=== Scoring ===
The concerto is scored for solo violin, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani and strings.

=== Movements ===

Like most concertos, the work is in three movements:

==== I. Allegro moderato ====
The first movement opens with a cushion of pianissimo strings pulsating gently. The soloist then enters with a first theme featuring a G-A-D motif, which is briefly echoed by a clarinet solo.

After a passionate high F and an unexpected E-flat major chord, the soloist introduces a new, dark theme on the G string. The lower woodwinds and timpani accompany the violinist in several runs. Cadenza-like arpeggios, double stops, and more runs from the soloist are accompanied by more woodwind restatements of the theme. The soloist then plays a relatively brief cadenza featuring rapid sixteenth notes and quick string crossings. After an ascending scale from the solo violin in broken octaves, the strings then enter in a symphonic manner, announcing the second half of the exposition material in. The music is then carried on by the bassoons and clarinets before another entrance of the soloist.

The violin plays a gentle, ascending motif, followed by a quick arpeggio which ascends into a heroic theme in B♭ minor, culminating in &quot;affettuoso&quot; octaves. The soloist softly soars in a slow, D♭ major arpeggio which leads into a tender, winding broken-octave passage built upon the heroic theme. These octaves build to a trill on one string with the winding figure played articulately on another. Another forceful orchestral tutti leads to an extensive violin cadenza. The cadenza occupies the developmental portion of the movement and ends just before the recapitulation, the heroic theme being played by the violin a semitone higher than before, in B minor. Returning to D minor, a long trill from the soloist suddenly transitions into the virtuosic coda, requiring remarkable skill in octaves, rapid and wide shifts to harmonics, and ricochet bowing. An upward cascade of double stops, a chord with a fingered harmonic, and a strong final D conclude the first movement.

==== II. Adagio di molto ====
The second movement is very lyrical. A short theme from the clarinets and oboes leads into the main theme, played by the solo violin over pizzicato strings. Dissonant accompaniments by the brass dominate the first part of the song-like movement.

After, the orchestra enters boldly with the introductory theme in a tempestuous mood. Suddenly, the solo violin enters with plaintive, double-stopped, polyrhythmic phrases. The passage develops into continuous triplet-sixteenth notes, which lead into a building trill section. After a climactic high C and B-flat, the music relaxes, leading to graceful upward scales in broken octaves by the violinist. Soon after, the solo violin increases the tension once again and finally comes to the movement&#x27;s main climax, which is essentially a variation of the first theme.

Then, the solo violin restates the first theme and, playing gently grace-noted figures, ends with a light float up to an all-serene harmonic D. Soft B-flat major chords by the orchestra accompany this tranquil close to the movement.

==== III. Allegro, ma non tanto ====
Tovey describes the final movement as a &quot;polonaise for polar bears&quot;. It opens with four bars of rhythmic percussion, with the lower strings playing &#x27;eighth note – sixteenth note – sixteenth note&#x27; figures. The violin boldly enters with the first theme on the G string. This first section offers a complete and brilliant display of violin gymnastics with up-bow staccato double-stops and a run with rapid string-crossing, then octaves, that leads into the first tutti.

The second theme in G minor is taken up by the orchestra and is almost like a waltz; the violin takes up the same theme in variations, with arpeggios and double-stops. Another short section concluding with a run of octaves makes a bridge into a recapitulation of the first theme.

The second theme is restated, this time in D minor, before leading to the final section introduced by the clarinets and low brass. A passage of harmonics in the violin precedes a sardonic passage of chords and slurred double-stops. A passage of broken octaves leads to an incredibly heroic few lines of double-stops and leaping octaves. A brief orchestral tutti comes before the violin leads the concerto to the finish with a D major scale up, returning down in flatted supertonic (then repeated). A flourish of ascending slur-separate sixteenth notes, punctuated by a resolute D from the violin and orchestra, concludes the concerto.

<doc id="578666" wikidata="Q1331405" url="?curid=578666" title="Frequency counter">
<text>A frequency counter is an electronic instrument, or component of one, that is used for measuring frequency. Frequency counters usually measure the number of cycles of oscillation or pulses per second in a periodic electronic signal. Such an instrument is sometimes called a cymometer, particularly one of Chinese manufacture.

==Operating principle==
Most frequency counters work by using a counter, which accumulates the number of events occurring within a specific period of time. After a preset period known as the &quot;gate time&quot; (1 second, for example), the value in the counter is transferred to a display, and the counter is reset to zero. If the event being measured repeats itself with sufficient stability and the frequency is considerably lower than that of the clock oscillator being used, the resolution of the measurement can be greatly improved by measuring the time required for an entire number of cycles, rather than counting the number of entire cycles observed for a pre-set duration (often referred to as the &quot;reciprocal technique&quot;). The internal oscillator, which provides the time signals, is called the &quot;timebase&quot;, and must be calibrated very accurately.

If the event to be counted is already in electronic form, simple interfacing with the instrument is all that is required. More complex signals may need some conditioning to make them suitable for counting. Most general-purpose frequency counters will include some form of amplifier, filtering, and shaping circuitry at the input. DSP technology, sensitivity control and hysteresis are other techniques to improve performance. Other types of periodic events that are not inherently electronic in nature will need to be converted using some form of transducer. For example, a mechanical event could be arranged to interrupt a light beam, and the counter made to count the resulting pulses.

Frequency counters designed for radio frequencies (RF) are also common and operate on the same principles as lower frequency counters. Often, they have more range before they overflow. For very high (microwave) frequencies, many designs use a high-speed prescaler to bring the signal frequency down to a point where normal digital circuitry can operate. The displays on such instruments consider this so they still display the correct value. Microwave frequency counters can currently measure frequencies up to almost 56 GHz. Above these frequencies, the signal to be measured is combined in a mixer with the signal from a local oscillator, producing a signal at the difference frequency, which is low enough to be measured directly.

==Accuracy and resolution==

The accuracy of a frequency counter is strongly dependent on the stability of its timebase. A timebase is very delicate, like the hands of a watch, and can be changed by movement, interference, or even drift due to age, meaning it might not &quot;tick&quot; correctly. This can make a frequency reading, when referenced to the timebase, seem higher or lower than the actual value. Highly accurate circuits are used to generate timebases for instrumentation purposes, usually using a quartz crystal oscillator within a sealed temperature-controlled chamber, known as an oven-controlled crystal oscillator or crystal oven.

For higher accuracy measurements, an external frequency reference tied to a very high stability oscillator, such as a GPS disciplined rubidium oscillator, may be used. Where the frequency does not need to be known to such a high degree of accuracy, simpler oscillators can be used. It is also possible to measure frequency using the same techniques in software in an embedded system. A central processing unit (CPU), for example, can be arranged to measure its own frequency of operation, provided it has some reference timebase to compare with.

Accuracy is often limited by the available resolution of the measurement. The resolution of a single count is generally proportional to the timebase oscillator frequency and the gate time. Improved resolution can be obtained by several techniques such as oversampling/averaging.

Additionally, accuracy can be significantly degraded by jitter on the signal being measured. It is possible to reduce this error by oversampling/averaging techniques.

==I/O Interfaces==

I/O interfaces allow the user to send information to the frequency counter and receive information from the frequency counter. Commonly used interfaces include RS-232, USB, GPIB and Ethernet. Besides sending measurement results, a counter can notify users when user-defined measurement limits are exceeded. Common to many counters are the SCPI commands used to control them. A new development is built-in LAN-based control via Ethernet complete with GUI&#x27;s. This allows one computer to control one or several instruments and eliminates the need to write SCPI commands.

<text>An archivist is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to records and archives determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==

As Richard Pearce-Moses wrote:

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service. The theory and scholarly work underpinning archives practices is called archival science.

The most common related occupations are librarians, museum curators, and records managers. The occupation of archivist is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate professional organizations. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the metadata, such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on provenance). The Society of American Archivists (SAA) also notes that while both professions preserve, collect, and make materials accessible, librarians can often obtain &quot;new copies of worn-out or lost books&quot;, while records in archival collections are unique and irreplaceable. The SAA further distinguishes libraries and archives based on the materials they keep and how they are accessed by patrons.

Because archival records are frequently unique, archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this sense, the archivist may have more in common with the museum curator than with the librarian. The SAA states that museum curators and archivists sometimes overlap in their duties, but that curators often collect and interpret three-dimensional objects, while archivists deal with paper, electronic, or audiovisual records. Even so, archival selections are sometimes exhibited in museums.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of records manager, although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

The SAA additionally notes that historians and archivists have a long-standing partnership, as archivists preserve, identify, and make records accessible, while historians use those records for their research.

==Duties and work environment==

Archivists&#x27; duties include acquiring and appraising new collections, arranging and describing records, providing reference service, and preserving materials. In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: provenance and original order. Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of &quot;respect des fonds&quot;, which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, finding aids need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost. However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.

Archivists&#x27; work encompasses a range of ethical decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a primary source of knowledge, and influence collective memory and identity. In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by codes of ethics. The Society of American Archivists first adopted a code of ethics in 1980; the International Council on Archives adopted one in 1996.

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist&#x27;s job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as processing archivist and reference archivist) may be delineated.

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including government agencies, local authorities, museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, colleges and universities, national parks and historic sites, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, genealogists, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an individual.

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or outreach programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as exhibitions, promotional events, community engagement, or even media coverage.

The advent of Encoded Archival Description (EAD), along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade. Many archivists are now acquiring basic XML skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.

==Skills==
Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of skills:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the preservation of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The Australian Society of Archivists is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses. The first University to offer archival training was the University of New South Wales, starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

 courses are offered at Curtin University, Charles Sturt University, Monash University and University of South Australia at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at Edith Cowan University is being phased out.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.

Many universities in Brazil, such as the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES), Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), and thirteen other universities, offer the degree in &quot;archivology&quot; which roughly translates to &quot;archival science.&quot;

===Canada===
There are various institutions which offer an archival science degree. One of those institutions is the University of British Columbia.

===Colombia===
The Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje – SENA – in chain training with the Tecnológico de Antioquia Tecnológico de Antioquia offers an archival science degree.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the &quot;École des chartes&quot;, founded in 1821. This prestigious &quot;grande école&quot; (literally, &quot;grand schools) offers a diploma in &quot;Archivist-Paleography&quot;, created in 1849, after a three-year curriculum. Many graduates become curators in archives, museums, and libraries or become researchers in universities.

Some universities, like University of Angers, Jean Moulin University Lyon 3, and Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University, offer a master&#x27;s degree in Archival Science,
while the Burgundy has a course for their history degree focusing on archives of 20th and 21st century Europe.

===Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the School of History of the University College Dublin (UCD) offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, providing the only recognized course in Ireland for the training of professional archivists, which is accredited by the Archives and Records Association. UCD also offers certificates in Archives Management and Records Management.

===New Zealand===
Victoria University of Wellington is the only tertiary institution in New Zealand that provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia. The Open Polytechnic of New Zealand has an undergraduate course in archives management.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently postgraduate courses in archives administration or management from Aberystwyth University, University College Dublin, University of Dundee, University of Glasgow, University of Liverpool, and University College London which are recognised by the Archives and Records Association (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary work experience before obtaining a place on the UK courses, while professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in archival science, public history, history, library science, or library and information science. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs. In 2002, the Society of American Archivists published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics, which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.

The Academy of Certified Archivists offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program. When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, .

A history of women in the archival professions detailed the Committee on the Status of Women in the political, social and cultural context of feminism and its lasting effect on the field.

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the Society of American Archivists, the Association of Canadian Archivists, the Archives and Records Association (UK/Ireland), the Colombian College of Archivists - CCA, and the Australian Society of Archivists, as well as any number of local or regional associations. These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners. In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of media preservation and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist&#x27;s job in order to stay current in the profession.

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen&#x27;s manuals of 1571. and Baldassarre Bonifacio&#x27;s &quot;De Archivis libris singularis&quot; of 1632.

In 1883, French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled &quot;Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques&quot; (&quot;Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives&quot;), in which he systematized the archival theory of the &quot;respect des fonds&quot;, first published by Natalis de Wailly in 1841.

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the &quot;Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven&quot; (&quot;Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives&quot;). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving provenance and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description. Many of these principles were subsequently adopted and developed by the British archivist Hilary Jenkinson in his &quot;Manual of Archive Administration&quot;, first published in 1922, with a revised edition appearing in 1937. 

In 1956, T. R. Schellenberg, known as the &quot;Father of American Archival Appraisal&quot;, published &quot;Modern Archives&quot;. Schellenberg&#x27;s work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson&#x27;s organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg&#x27;s methods, especially in the United States of America, modern Records Management as a separate but related discipline was born.

In 1972, Ernst Posner published &quot;Archives in the Ancient World&quot;. Posner&#x27;s work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history. Due to his role in the development of American archival theory and practice, he was sometimes called &quot;the Dean of American archivists.&quot; Norton promoted the establishment of archives as a profession separate from history or library science and developed the American archival tradition to emphasize an administrator/archivist rather than an historian/archivist. She encouraged learning through experimentation, practical usage, and community discussion. While editor of &quot;The American Archivist&quot; she emphasized technical rather than scholarly issues, believing that archival records were useful in ways other than scholarly research.

==On the Internet==
===Archives 2.0===
Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs, wikis, as well as open access and open source philosophies. Archives 2.0, by extension, is more of a participatory online repository than a true-to-form established entity, although it has fallen considerably behind Web 2.0 in overall acceptance by archivists themselves. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience. The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* &quot;Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not &#x27;unmeasurable&#x27; results;
* Iterative products, not &#x27;perfect&#x27; products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars.&quot;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives.

=== Internet libraries ===
Some archivists operate public libraries that are accessible on the Internet. Examples include the illegal shadow libraries Library Genesis and Anna&#x27;s Archive – humanity&#x27;s largest library of books – and Sci-Hub – humanity&#x27;s largest public library of scientific articles. Proponents of these libraries have made use of BitTorrent and IPFS technologies to make these sites decentralized, resilient and uncensorable. There are also other projects that for instance archive digital games and make them accessible via the Internet or that keep content of defunct websites accessible.

The most comprehensive public archive on the Internet is the Internet Archive which provides free public access to collections of digitized materials, including websites (via the Wayback Machine), software applications/games, music, movies/videos, moving images, and books. As of September 2023, the Internet Archive holds over 39 million books and texts, 13.6 million movies, videos and TV shows, 1 million software programs, 15 million audio files, 4.7 million images, and 840 billion web pages.

<doc id="578675" wikidata="Q976768" url="?curid=578675" title="Transition-minimized differential signaling">
<text>Transition-minimized differential signaling (TMDS) is a technology for transmitting high-speed serial data used by the DVI and HDMI video interfaces, as well as by other digital communication interfaces.

The transmitter incorporates a coding algorithm which reduces electromagnetic interference over copper cables and enables robust clock recovery at the receiver to achieve high skew tolerance for driving longer cables as well as shorter low-cost cables.

==Coding==
The method is a form of 8b/10b encoding but using a code-set that differs from the original IBM form. A two-stage process converts an input of 8 bits into a 10 bit code with particular desirable properties. In the first stage, the first bit is untransformed and each subsequent bit is either XOR or XNOR transformed against the previous bit. The encoder chooses between XOR and XNOR by determining which will result in the fewest transitions; the ninth bit encodes which operation was used. In the second stage, the first eight bits are optionally inverted to even out the balance of ones and zeros and therefore the sustained average DC level; the tenth bit encodes whether this inversion took place.

The 10-bit TMDS symbol can represent either an 8-bit data value during normal data transmission, or 2 bits of control signals during screen blanking. Of the 1,024 possible combinations of the 10 transmitted bits:
* 460 combinations are used to represent an 8-bit data value, as most of the 256 possible values have two encoded variants (some values have only one),
* 4 combinations are used to represent 2 bits of control signals (C0 and C1 in the table below); unlike the data symbols these have such properties that they can be reliably recognized even if sync is lost and are therefore also used for synchronizing the decoder,
* 2 combinations are used as a guard band before HDMI data,
* 558 remaining combinations are reserved and forbidden.

Control data is encoded using the values in the table below. Control data characters are designed to have a large number (7) of transitions to help the receiver synchronize its clock with the transmitter clock.

On Channel 0 the C0 and C1 bits encode the Horizontal synchronization (HSync) and Vertical synchronization (VSync) signals. On the other channels they encode the CTL0 through CTL3 signals which are unused by DVI but in the case of HDMI are used as a preamble indicating the type of data about to be transferred (Video Data or Data Island), the HDCP status and so on. 

TMDS was developed by Silicon Image Inc. as a member of the Digital Display Working Group.

TMDS is similar to low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) in that it uses differential signaling to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) which allows faster signal transfers with increased accuracy. TMDS also uses a twisted pair for noise reduction, rather than coaxial cable that is conventional for carrying video signals. Like LVDS, the data is transmitted serially over the data link. When transmitting video data and used in HDMI, three TMDS twisted pairs are used to transfer video data. Each of the three links corresponds to a different RGB component.

The physical layer for TMDS is current mode logic (CML), DC coupled and terminated to 3.3 Volts. While the data is DC balanced (by the encoding algorithm), DC coupling is part of the specification. TMDS can be switched or repeated by any method applicable to CML signals. However, if DC coupling to the transmitter is not preserved, some transmitters&#x27; &quot;monitor detection&quot; features may not work properly.

<text>The Digital Display Working Group (DDWG) was a group whose purpose was to define and maintain the Digital Visual Interface standard, which was formed in 1998. It was organized by Intel, Silicon Image, Compaq, Fujitsu, HP, IBM, and NEC. The best-known published specification is the DVI interface.

The group developed the Digital Visual Interface (DVI) standard in 1999.

In 2011, founding member HP reported that the group had not met in 5 years.

<text>A programmable logic array (PLA) is a kind of programmable logic device used to implement combinational logic circuits. The PLA has a set of programmable AND gate planes, which link to a set of programmable OR gate planes, which can then be conditionally complemented to produce an output. It has 2N AND gates for N input variables, and for M outputs from the PLA, there should be M OR gates, each with programmable inputs from all of the AND gates. This layout allows for many logic functions to be synthesized in the sum of products canonical forms.

PLAs differ from programmable array logic devices (PALs and GALs) in that both the AND and OR gate planes are programmable. PAL has programmable AND gates but fixed OR gates 

== History ==
In 1970, Texas Instruments developed a mask-programmable IC based on the IBM read-only associative memory or ROAM. This device, the TMS2000, was programmed by altering the metal layer during the production of the IC. The TMS2000 had up to 17 inputs and 18 outputs with 8 JK flip-flops for memory. TI coined the term &quot;Programmable Logic Array&quot; for this device.

==Implementation procedure==

# Preparation in SOP (sum of products) form.
# Obtain the minimum SOP form to reduce the number of product terms to a minimum.
# Decide the input connection of the AND matrix for generating the required product term.
# Then decide the input connections of the OR matrix to generate the sum terms.
# Decide the connections of the inversion matrix.
# Program the PLA.

== Advantages over read-only memory ==
The desired outputs for each combination of inputs &quot;could&quot; be programmed into a read-only memory, with the inputs being driven by the address bus and the outputs being read out as data. However, that would require a separate memory location for &quot;every&quot; possible combination of inputs, including combinations that are never supposed to occur, and also duplicating data for &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; conditions (for example, logic like &quot;if input A is 1, then, as far as output X is concerned, we don&#x27;t care what input B is&quot;: in a ROM this would have to be written out twice, once for each possible value of B, and as more &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; inputs are added, the duplication grows exponentially); therefore, a programmable logic array can often implement a piece of logic using fewer transistors than the equivalent in read-only memory. This is particularly valuable when it is part of a processing chip where transistors are scarce (for example, the original 6502 chip contained a PLA to direct various operations of the processor).

== Applications ==
One application of a PLA is to implement the control over a datapath. It defines various states in an instruction set, and produces the next state (by conditional branching). [e.g. if the machine is in state 2, and will go to state 4 if the instruction contains an immediate field; then the PLA should define the actions of the control in state 2, will set the next state to be 4 if the instruction contains an immediate field, and will define the actions of the control in state 4]. Programmable logic arrays should correspond to a state diagram for the system.

The earliest Commodore 64 home computers released in 1982 (into early 1983) initially used a programmed Signetics 82S100 PLA, but as the demand increased, MOS Technology / Commodore Semiconductor Group began producing a mask-programmed PLA, which bore part number 906114-01.

<text>Plena is a genre of music and dance native to Ponce, Puerto Rico.

==Origins==
The plena genre originated in Barrio San Antón, Ponce, Puerto Rico, around 1900. It was influenced by the bomba style of music. Originally, sung texts were not associated with the plena, which was rendered by guitar, accordion and pandero, but eventually, in 1907, singing was added. Plena was often called the &quot;periodico cantado&quot; or &quot;sung newspaper&quot; for the lower classes because it spread messages among people, similar to the corridos in Mexico.

== History ==
The plena was a result of the mixing of the culturally diverse popular class, where their workplace, neighborhood, and life experiences met to create an expressive, satirical style of music. It became a way for the working class to gain empowerment through parody. Due to originating in the lower social class, it was regarded by the upper class as &quot;a menace to public order and private property&quot; and was for many years associated with people of &quot;la vida alegre&quot; (the merry life), referring to prostitutes, dancers, alcoholics, and moral degenerates. Singing and dancing of the plena often happened in &quot;cafetines&quot;, bars that frequently doubled as brothels and where interracial socializing and sexual encounters were free to take place.

According to singers discussing the use of the plena, they stated it was song with lyrics that related to a current event. For example, if someone drowned or was killed, a plena would be written about it. , , , and were some plenas which became wildly popular.

The eventual widespread acceptance of the plena can be attributed to the increased number of people joining the workforce, which led to a new demand for public leisure. It was still considered indecent by the upper class, who fought against its rising popularity. In December 1917, an ordinance was passed banning the dances from happening inside the city limits. It took another decade for the plena to gain widespread popularity throughout Puerto Rico and cross racial and cultural boundaries. Listening to plena at home and at neighborhood- or municipal-sanctioned celebrations became acceptable and was no longer considered morally tainted by &quot;respectable&quot; white upper class Ponceños. Eventually, with much whitewashing to make it more palatable to the masses, plena was embraced in earnest as a style of music that united Puerto Ricans. However, with the acceptance of the upper class, what began as a vitally important cultural identifier and personal expression of philosophy, community, and self to the lower class became an entertaining spectacle for the white upper class.

By the 1930s, the plena was accessible to all through the radio and record industries.

==Genre==
Plena music is generally folkloric in nature. The music&#x27;s beat and rhythm are usually played using hand drums called panderetas, also known as panderos. The music is accompanied by a scrape gourd, the guiro. Panderetas resemble tambourines but without the jingles. These are handheld drums with stretched animal skins, usually goat skin, covering a round wooden frame. Three different sizes of pandereta are used in plena: the Seguidor (the largest of the three), the Punteador (the medium-sized drum), and the requinto. An advantage of this percussion arrangement is its portability, contributing to the plena&#x27;s spontaneous appearance at social gatherings. Other instruments commonly heard in plena music are the cuatro, the maracas, and accordions.

The fundamental melody of the plena, as in all regional Puerto Rican music, has a decided Spanish strain; it is marked in the resemblance between the plena Santa María and a song composed in the Middle Ages by Alfonso the Wise, King of Spain. The lyrics of plena songs are usually octosyllabic and assonant. Following the universal custom the theme touches upon all phases of life—romance, politics, and current events. Generally, anything which appeals to the imagination of the people, such as the arrival of a personage, a crime, a bank moratorium, or a hurricane, can be the subject of plena music.

==Spread==
Plena is played throughout Puerto Rico especially during special occasions such as the Christmas season, and as the musical backdrop for civic protests, due to its traditional use as a vehicle for social commentary. When plena is played the audience often joins in the singing, clapping, and dancing. Plena is also enjoyed by the Puerto Rican diaspora outside of Puerto Rico. Pleneros de la 21, for example, traveled to Hawaii to perform for the Puerto Rican diaspora there which include descendants of Puerto Ricans who immigrated to Hawaii from Puerto Rico in the early 20th century.

==Composers==
As a folk genre, there have been many good composers, some well known in their day and into the present. Perhaps one of the genre&#x27;s most celebrated composers and performers was Manuel Jiménez, known as &#x27;El Canario&#x27;. Certainly, there were many others, including such greats as Ramito, Ismael Rivera, Mon Rivera (the junior), and Rafael Cortijo. In 2006, Tito Matos and Los Pleneros de la 21 received a Grammy nomination for their plena songs recording.

The genre has had a revival recently, as evident by the emergence of many plena bands (such as Plena Libre, Viento de agua and others) and its use in various songs, such as Ricky Martin&#x27;s recent song &quot;Pégate&quot; and Ivy Queen&#x27;s &quot;Vamos A Celebrar&quot;.

In 1953, Puerto Rican writer, Luis Palés Matos wrote urging the Puerto Rican woman to move it and ends the plena with the line (to make &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; angry).

<doc id="578693" wikidata="Q1378651" url="?curid=578693" title="Programmable Array Logic">
<text>Programmable Array Logic (PAL) is a family of programmable logic device semiconductors used to implement logic functions in digital circuits that was introduced by Monolithic Memories, Inc. (MMI) in March 1978. MMI obtained a registered trademark on the term PAL for use in &quot;Programmable Semiconductor Logic Circuits&quot;. The trademark is currently held by Lattice Semiconductor.

PAL devices consisted of a small PROM (programmable read-only memory) core and additional output logic used to implement particular desired logic functions with few components.

Using specialized machines, PAL devices were &quot;field-programmable&quot;. PALs were available in several variants:

* &quot;One-time programmable&quot; (OTP) devices could not be updated and reused after initial programming. (MMI also offered a similar family called HAL, or &quot;hard array logic&quot;, which were like PAL devices except that they were mask-programmed at the factory.)
* UV erasable versions (e.g.: PALCxxxxx e.g.: PALC22V10) had a quartz window over the chip die and could be erased for re-use with an ultraviolet light source just like an EPROM.
* Later versions (PALCExxx e.g.: PALCE22V10) were flash erasable devices.

In most applications, electrically erasable GALs are now deployed as pin-compatible direct replacements for one-time programmable PALs.

==History==
Before PALs were introduced, designers of digital logic circuits would use small-scale integration (SSI) components, such as those in the 7400 series TTL (transistor-transistor logic) family; the 7400 family included a variety of logic building blocks, such as gates (NOT, NAND, NOR, AND, OR), multiplexers (MUXes) and demultiplexers (DEMUXes), flip-flops (D-type, JK, etc.) and others. One PAL device would typically replace dozens of such &quot;discrete&quot; logic packages, so the SSI business declined as the PAL business took off. PALs were used advantageously in many products, such as minicomputers, as documented in Tracy Kidder&#x27;s best-selling book &quot;The Soul of a New Machine&quot;.

PALs were not the first commercial programmable logic devices; Signetics had been selling its field programmable logic array (FPLA) since 1975. These devices were completely unfamiliar to most circuit designers and were perceived to be too difficult to use. The FPLA had a relatively slow maximum operating speed (due to having both programmable-AND and programmable-OR arrays), was expensive, and had a poor reputation for testability. Another factor limiting the acceptance of the FPLA was the large package, a 600-mil (0.6&quot;, or 15.24 mm) wide 28-pin dual in-line package (DIP).

The project to create the PAL device was managed by John Birkner and the actual PAL circuit was designed by H. T. Chua. In a previous job (at mini-computer manufacturer Computer Automation), Birkner had developed a 16-bit processor using 80 standard logic devices. His experience with standard logic led him to believe that user-programmable devices would be more attractive if the devices were designed to replace standard logic. This meant that the package sizes had to be more typical of the existing devices, and the speeds had to be improved. MMI intended PALs to be a relatively low cost (sub $3) part. However, the company initially had severe manufacturing yield problems and had to sell the devices for over $50. This threatened the viability of the PAL as a commercial product, and MMI was forced to license the product line to National Semiconductor. PALs were later &quot;second sourced&quot; by Texas Instruments and Advanced Micro Devices.

==Process technologies==
Early PALs were 20-pin DIP components fabricated in silicon using bipolar transistor technology with one-time programmable (OTP) titanium-tungsten programming fuses. Later devices were manufactured by Cypress, Lattice Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices using CMOS technology.

The original 20- and 24-pin PALs were denoted by MMI as medium-scale integration (MSI) devices.

==PAL architecture==

The PAL architecture consists of two main components: a logic plane and output logic macrocells.

===Programmable logic plane===
The programmable logic plane is a programmable read-only memory (PROM) array that allows the signals present on the device pins, or the logical complements of those signals, to be routed to output logic macrocells.

PAL devices have arrays of transistor cells arranged in a &quot;fixed-OR, programmable-AND&quot; plane used to implement &quot;sum-of-products&quot; binary logic equations for each of the outputs in terms of the inputs and either synchronous or asynchronous feedback from the outputs.

===Output logic===
The early 20-pin PALs had 10 inputs and 8 outputs. The outputs were active low and could be registered or combinational. Members of the PAL family were available with various output structures called &quot;output logic macrocells&quot; or OLMCs. Prior to the introduction of the &quot;V&quot; (for &quot;variable&quot;) series, the types of OLMCs available in each PAL were fixed at the time of manufacture. (The PAL16L8 had 8 combinational outputs, and the PAL16R8 had 8 registered outputs. The PAL16R6 had 6 registered and 2 combinational outputs, while the PAL16R4 had 4 of each.) Each output could have up to 8 product terms (effectively AND gates); however, the combinational outputs used one of the terms to control a bidirectional output buffer. There were other combinations that had fewer outputs with more product terms per output and were available with active high outputs (&quot;H&quot; series). The &quot;X&quot; series of devices had an XOR gate before the register. There were also similar 24-pin versions of these PALs.

This fixed output structure often frustrated designers attempting to optimize the utility of PAL devices because output structures of different types were often required by their applications. (For example, one could not get 5 registered outputs with 3 active high combinational outputs.) So, in June 1983 AMD introduced the 22V10, a 24-pin device with 10 output logic macrocells. Each macrocell could be configured by the user to be combinational or registered, active high or active low. The number of product terms allocated to an output varied from 8 to 16. This one device could replace all of the 24-pin fixed function PAL devices. Members of the PAL &quot;V&quot; (&quot;variable&quot;) series included the PAL16V8, PAL20V8 and PAL22V10.

==Programming PALs==
PALs were programmed electrically using binary patterns (as JEDEC ASCII/hexadecimal files) and a special electronic programming system available from either the manufacturer or a third party, such as DATA I/O. In addition to single-unit device programmers, device feeders and gang programmers were often used when more than just a few PALs needed to be programmed. (For large volumes, electrical programming costs could be eliminated by having the manufacturer fabricate a custom metal mask used to program the customers&#x27; patterns at the time of manufacture; MMI used the term &quot;hard array logic&quot; (HAL) to refer to devices programmed in this way.)

===Programming languages (by chronological order of appearance) ===

Though some engineers programmed PAL devices by manually editing files containing the binary fuse pattern data, most opted to design their logic using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Data I/O&#x27;s ABEL, Logical Devices&#x27; CUPL, or MMI&#x27;s PALASM. These were computer-assisted design (CAD) (now referred to as &quot;electronic design automation&quot;) programs which translated (or &quot;compiled&quot;) the designers&#x27; logic equations into binary fuse map files used to program (and often test) each device.

====PALASM====
The PALASM (from &quot;PAL assembler&quot;) language was developed by John Birkner in the early 1980s and the PALASM compiler was written by MMI in FORTRAN IV on an IBM 370/168. MMI made the source code available to users at no cost. By 1983, MMI customers ran versions on the DEC PDP-11, Data General NOVA, Hewlett-Packard HP 2100, MDS800 and others.

It was used to express Boolean equations for the output pins in a text file, which was then converted to the &#x27;fuse map&#x27; file for the programming system using a vendor-supplied program; later the option of translation from schematics became common, and later still, &#x27;fuse maps&#x27; could be &#x27;synthesized&#x27; from an HDL (hardware description language) such as Verilog.

====CUPL====
Assisted Technology released CUPL (Compiler for Universal Programmable Logic) in September 1983. The software was always referred to as CUPL and never the expanded acronym. It was the first commercial design tool that supported multiple PLD families. The initial release was for the IBM PC and MS-DOS, but it was written in the C programming language so it could be ported to additional platforms. Assisted Technology was acquired by Personal CAD Systems (P-CAD) in July 1985. In 1986, PCAD&#x27;s schematic capture package could be used as a front end for CUPL. CUPL was later acquired by Logical Devices and is now owned by Altium. CUPL is currently available as an integrated development package for Microsoft Windows.

Atmel releases for free WinCUPL (their own design software for all Atmel SPLDs and CPLDs). Atmel was acquired by Microchip in 2016.

====ABEL====
Data I/O Corporation released ABEL in April, 1984. The development team was Michael Holley, Mike Mraz, Gerrit Barrere, Walter Bright, Bjorn Freeman-Benson, Kyu Lee, David Pellerin, Mary Bailey, Daniel Burrier and Charles Olivier.

Data I/O spun off the ABEL product line into an electronic design automation company called Synario Design Systems and then sold Synario to MINC Inc in 1997.
MINC was focused on developing FPGA development tools. The company closed its doors in 1998 and Xilinx acquired some of MINC&#x27;s assets including the ABEL language and tool set. ABEL then became part of the Xilinx Webpack tool suite.
Now Xilinx owns ABEL.

===Device programmers===
Popular device programmers included Data I/O Corporation&#x27;s Model 60A Logic Programmer and Model 2900.

One of the first PAL programmers was the Structured Design SD20/24. They had the PALASM software built-in and only required a CRT terminal to enter the equations and view the fuse plots. After fusing, the outputs of the PAL could be verified if test vectors were entered in the source file.

==Successors==
After MMI succeeded with the 20-pin PAL parts introduced circa 1978, AMD introduced the 24-pin 22V10 PAL with additional features. After buying out MMI (circa 1987), AMD spun off a consolidated operation as Vantis, and that business was acquired by Lattice Semiconductor in 1999.

Altera introduced the EP300 (first CMOS PAL) in 1983 and later moved into the FPGA business.

Lattice Semiconductor introduced the generic array logic (GAL) family in 1985, with functional equivalents of the &quot;V&quot; series PALs that used reprogrammable logic planes based on EEPROM (electrically eraseable programmable read-only memory) technology. National Semiconductor was a second source for GAL parts.

AMD introduced a similar family called PALCE. In general one GAL part is able to function as any of the similar family PAL devices. For example, the 16V8 GAL is able to replace the 16L8, 16H8, 16H6, 16H4, 16H2 and 16R8 PALs (and many others besides).

ICT (International CMOS Technology) introduced the PEEL 18CV8 in 1986. The 20-pin CMOS EEPROM part could be used in place of any of the registered-output bipolar PALs and used much less power.

Larger-scale programmable logic devices were introduced by Atmel, Lattice Semiconductor, and others. These devices extended the PAL architecture by including multiple logic planes and/or burying logic macrocells within the logic plane(s). The term &quot;complex programmable logic device&quot; (CPLD) was introduced to differentiate these devices from their PAL and GAL predecessors, which were then sometimes referred to as &quot;simple programmable logic devices&quot; (SPLDs).

Another large programmable logic device is the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). These are devices currently made by Intel (who acquired Altera) and Xilinx (who was acquired by AMD) and other semiconductor manufacturers.

<doc id="578694" wikidata="Q5630717" url="?curid=578694" title="HMCS Athabaskan (R79)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was a destroyer that served with the Royal Canadian Navy in the immediate post-Second World War era. She was the second destroyer to bear the name &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, after the many tribes throughout western Canada that speak Athabaskan family languages. Both this ship and the original were destroyers and thus this vessel became known as &quot;Athabaskan II&quot; or &quot;Athabee&quot;.

Having missed action within the North Atlantic, &quot;Athabaskan II&quot; served in the Korean War and played an important role in Canadian post-war naval reform following a crew protest in 1949.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Athabaskan&quot; was ordered in April 1942. She was laid down 15 May 1943 at Halifax Shipyards and launched 4 May 1946. She was one of four Tribal-class destroyers built in Halifax during the Second World War. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 20 January 1948 at Halifax.

After commissioning, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; sailed for the west coast to begin her career as a training ship. She performed this task until the outbreak of the Korean War. It was during this period that the mutiny took place.

===1949 &#x27;mutiny&#x27;===

On 26 February 1949, when the &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was on fueling stop at Manzanillo, Colima, Mexico, ninety leading seamen and below – constituting more than half the ship&#x27;s company – locked themselves in their messdecks, and refused to come out until getting the captain to hear their grievances.

The captain acted with great sensitivity to defuse the crisis, entering the mess for an informal discussion of the sailors&#x27; grievances and carefully avoiding using the term &quot;mutiny&quot; which could have had severe legal consequences for the sailors involved. Specifically, while talking with the disgruntled crew members, the captain is known to have placed his cap over a written list of demands which could have been used as legal evidence of a mutiny, pretending not to notice it. Years later, one of her crew suggested that one specific grievance involved the lack of rum rations, a tradition which continued until 1970.

At nearly the same time, similar incidents happened on at Nanjing, China, and on the carrier in the Caribbean, both of whose captains acted similarly to that of the &quot;Athabaskan&quot;.

===Korean War===
&quot;Athabaskan&quot; served three tours of duty during the Korean War, departing from Esquimalt for her first on 5 July 1950 and returning from her third on 11 December 1953. Joining the UN forces, she participated in patrols, anti-submarine protection, ship escorts, and assisted in capturing ports, transporting troops, evacuation, and bombardments. As a result of her actions, she earned the battle honour &quot;Korea 1950–53&quot;

===Post Korean War===
Following Korea, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; underwent a major refit, recommissioning on 25 October 1954 as a destroyer escort. On 1 January 1955, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was assigned to the Second Canadian Escort Squadron of Pacific Command. While on a training cruise with HCMS Cayuga, the 16-year-old female stowaway Joan Pilapil was discovered on 7 August 1955. In November 1955, the Second Canadian Escort Squadron was among the Canadian units that took part in one of the largest naval exercises since the Second World War off the coast of California.

In January 1959, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; left for the east coast to become part of a Tribal-class squadron. She was battered by a major storm during a NATO training exercise in November and December 1959. The &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was damaged by a collision with HMCS &quot;Bonaventure&quot; in 1963.

One of her final actions was rescuing the crew of a Liberian tanker &quot;Amphialos&quot;, which had broken up and sank 40 kilometres off of Liverpool. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was placed in reserve in 1964 at Halifax.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Athabaskan&quot; was paid off for disposal on 21 April 1966. She was sold in 1969 and scrapped in 1970 at La Spezia, Italy.

<doc id="578697" wikidata="Q2008499" url="?curid=578697" title="Vancouver Whitecaps (1986–2010)">
<text>The Vancouver Whitecaps were a Canadian professional soccer club based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Founded in 1986, the team played its final year in the second tier of the United States soccer pyramid in the NASL Conference of the USSF Division 2 Professional League coached by Teitur Thordarson. The team played its home games at Swangard Stadium in nearby Burnaby, British Columbia. The team&#x27;s colours were blue and white.

On March 19, 2009, an ownership group led by principal Greg Kerfoot was granted a Major League Soccer expansion franchise which began play in 2011 under the name Vancouver Whitecaps FC.

In addition to its men&#x27;s side the Whitecaps also field a women&#x27;s team in the USL W-League, two developmental teams (Vancouver Whitecaps Residency, in the USL Premier Development League, and the Whitecaps FC Prospects, in the Pacific Coast Soccer League), and four youth teams in the USL Super Y-League (Coastal WFC, Mountain WFC, Surrey WFC and Okanagan WFC) ranging in age from U13 to U17 for both boys and girls.

The team was previously known as the Vancouver 86ers of both the Canadian Soccer League, American Professional Soccer League (APSL), and later the A-League. The club later played in two later versions of the second tier A-League known as the USL-1 and USSF Division 2 Professional League in North America.

==History==
===Vancouver 86ers===
In 1986, a professional soccer team was again launched in Vancouver. The club was initially going to be named Vancouver United, but that name was rejected for sounding too British. The name Vancouver 86ers was chosen instead to commemorate the founding of the city of Vancouver in 1886, the founding of the team in 1986, the Expo 86 hosted by Vancouver that year, the Canadian national team&#x27;s first World Cup qualification, and the 86 people who contributed $500 each to fund the new team as the West Coast Soccer Society.

The 86ers played in the Canadian Soccer League (CSL). Led by player/head coach Bob Lenarduzzi and his assistant Alan Errington, the 86ers were triumphant in their inaugural CSL match, as they defeated Edmonton Brick Men 4–2 in front of 7,646 fans at Swangard Stadium in Burnaby, BC, on June 7, 1987. The 86ers went on to finish second in the Western Division standings that year before bowing out to inaugural league champions Calgary Kickers in the playoff semifinals. From 1988 to 1991, the 86ers won four straight CSL Championships, as well and five consecutive CSL regular-season first-place finishes from 1988 to 1992.

In 1988–1989, the team, coached by Bob Lenarduzzi, set a North American professional sports record by playing 46 consecutive games without a loss. Also in 1988 the Vancouver 86ers and Calgary Kickers played six friendly matches each against the Western Soccer Alliance in the month of May.

In 1990, the Vancouver 86ers captured the North American Club Championship after defeating the Maryland Bays 3–2 in the final played in Burnaby. The game was played between the champions of the Canadian Soccer League and the champions of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). The 86ers however came up short in the first round of the 1992 Professional Cup North American Club Championship. Facing APSL champions Colorado Foxes over two legs, Vancouver suffered a heartbreaking 3–2 defeat in the first leg in Colorado on August 3, 1992, before the Foxes advanced to the final, as a 2–1 second-leg win at Swangard on August 11, 1992, secured a 5–3 aggregate victory for Colorado. Vancouver played in the CSL from its inception in 1987 until the league folded in 1992, and then moved over to the APSL in 1993 which was later absorbed into the USL hierarchy of leagues in 1997 becoming the A-League, later renamed the USL.

===Vancouver Whitecaps (USL)===

In 2001, the team began to use the old Vancouver Whitecaps moniker (signifying both the &#x27;white caps&#x27; of the nearby mountains, and the waves of the Pacific Ocean). 
In 2003, the name was again changed, albeit only slightly, to Whitecaps FC, which encompasses the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s, and youth development teams within the organization. At this time, the Whitecaps logo changed slightly in colour (the light teal-green was replaced with a brighter blue) and the word &quot;Vancouver&quot; was dropped from the image.

In 2006, the Whitecaps organization won an unprecedented double-championship, claiming both the United Soccer Leagues First Division championship trophy, defeating the host Rochester Rhinos 3–0 at PAETEC Park, and winning the W-League women&#x27;s trophy. The men&#x27;s team also won the Nation&#x27;s Cup, a new tournament established by their club as a way to feature the Whitecaps playing against international competition. The 2006 Nation&#x27;s Cup tournament featured the Chinese and Indian U-20 National teams and Championship Welsh club Cardiff City F.C. (the &quot;Bluebirds&quot;). The gradually added the &quot;Vancouver&quot; back into their name, changing it officially to &quot;Vancouver Whitecaps FC&quot;.

The following season, the Whitecaps signed a deal to play an exhibition match against the Los Angeles Galaxy, which featured international David Beckham, and promoted Director of Soccer Operations Bob Lenarduzzi to team president.

October 12, 2008, they claimed their second United Soccer Leagues First Division championship with a 2–1 victory over the Puerto Rico Islanders. Charles Gbeke scored twice with his head in the second half to help secure the title. In 2009, they placed 7th in the league and were eliminated in the final by the Montreal Impact on a 6–3 aggregate.

In November 2009 the Whitecaps, along with several other teams, announced their intent to leave the USL First Division to become the co-founders of a new North American Soccer League, which was to begin play in 2010. On January 7, 2010, the USSF announced that neither the USL nor the NASL would be permitted to have a second division league,
and the USSF would administer a league where the NASL and USL are conferences within the league.

On November 24, 2009, it was announced that Paul Barber, the former executive director of Tottenham Hotspur, will become the Chief Executive Operations director of the Caps.

Whitecaps played a 30-match regular season, with 15 home games and a 15 games away in the United States Soccer Federation Division 2 Professional League.

===The Whitecaps and Major League Soccer===

In May 2008, the Whitecaps announced plans to move to BC Place stadium once renovations were completed. Following the announcement, MLS commissioner Don Garber commented &quot;there is no doubt the market for professional soccer exists in Vancouver, as we saw last November when nearly 50,000 fans attended the exhibition match between the Los Angeles Galaxy and the Whitecaps&quot;.

On July 24, 2008, the MLS announced they were seeking to add two expansion franchises for the 2011 season. One day later, the Whitecaps officially announced that they were pursuing one of the two expansion slots. The Whitecaps also announced that local sports icon Steve Nash will join the Whitecaps ownership team.

Vancouver&#x27;s bid was officially submitted on October 15, 2008, along with bids from six other cities. Whitecaps representatives Greg Kerfoot and Jeff Mallett met with MLS officials on November 21, 2008, to go over their bid. Don Garber, who was previously involved in National Football League expansion, described the bid presentation as, &quot;one of the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Garber and MLS president Mark Abbott were in Vancouver on December 7, 2008, to tour BC Place Stadium and learn about the proposed renovations, which were scheduled to be completed in time for the 2011 MLS season.

Vancouver was officially named an MLS expansion city on March 18, 2009, and joined the league in 2011. They began their inaugural MLS season at Empire Field, a temporary stadium built at the former site of Empire Stadium, and moved into BC Place Stadium when renovations to the stadium were completed.

* Swangard Stadium; Burnaby, British Columbia (2003–2010)

===Proposed new stadium===
For some time, the City of Vancouver and the ownership group of the Whitecaps were considering the idea to build the team a soccer-specific stadium called Whitecaps Waterfront Stadium. The new stadium was to be built over the railway tracks east of Waterfront Station on Burrard Inlet.

This 16,000-seat stadium would have replaced Swangard Stadium as the home field for the USL&#x27;s Vancouver Whitecaps.

There was a fair degree of controversy with regards to this location; a Vancouver council session to debate the issue was extended to four nights to allow public input. Detractors viewed the proposed stadium as an incongruous addition to nearby historic Gastown that would block waterfront access and promote piecemeal development of the area. Proponents of the development felt that the stadium would attract new business to the downtown and Gastown areas, particularly since the soccer team tended to attract a family-oriented audience.

On July 11, 2006, Vancouver City Council voted unanimously to proceed with the stadium project, so long as the Whitecaps could meet certain conditions regarding land use. On January 22, 2007, the Whitecaps filed a new proposal shifting the proposed site for the stadium project to the current location of the SeaBus terminal, a short distance northwest of the previous site.

With the Whitecaps moving up to MLS, the franchise has signed to initially play at Empire Field, and then BC Place Stadium from 2011 to at least 2015. It was hoped that the new facility would be completed by the 2016 MLS season. Due to the hurdles of getting the new stadium approved, the project has been abandoned with the team committed to playing at BC Place Stadium.

==Club culture==

===Mascot===

The Whitecaps&#x27; mascot was named Winger. He is a bird who wears a Whitecaps jersey and carries a large drum to encourage the crowd. He often uses signs to get fans in the grandstands to cheer.

===Fans===
The Whitecaps have an independent supporters group known as the &quot;Southsiders&quot;. Founded in 1999, the group is named for their preferred seating area in the south end of Swangard Stadium. The Southsiders, once described as a &quot;rabid supporters group&quot;, identify themselves as Canada&#x27;s oldest supporters association for professional domestic soccer.

The group originally called themselves &quot;The Carlsberg Crew,&quot; named for the beer company that sponsored Swangard&#x27;s beer garden. The name was changed to &quot;The Canterbury Chorus&quot; for the subsequent season, as the beer sponsorship had changed between seasons. To avoid changing names every time the sponsor changed, the group chose the name &quot;The Southsiders&quot;.

===Rival clubs===
The Vancouver Whitecaps have two historic rivals, the Pacific Northwest Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders. These three teams competed in the yearly Cascadia Cup through 2008. In 2009, the Cup involved only the Whitecaps and Timbers because the Sounders were replaced by an MLS team of the same name.

The Whitecaps also competed on a yearly basis with the Montreal Impact and Toronto FC for the Voyageurs Cup or Canadian Championship. The winner of this series advances to the CONCACAF Champions League.

<text>Fallout 2 (also known as Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game) is a 1998 role-playing video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Productions. It is a sequel to &quot;Fallout&quot; (1997), featuring similar graphics and game mechanics. The game&#x27;s story takes place in 2241, 79 years after the events of &quot;Fallout&quot; and 164 years after the atomic war which reduced the vast majority of the world to a nuclear wasteland. The player assumes the role of the Chosen One, the grandchild of the first game&#x27;s protagonist, and undertakes a quest to save their small village on the West Coast of the United States.

&quot;Fallout 2&quot; was well received by critics, who praised its gameplay and storyline, and considered it a worthy successor to the original &quot;Fallout&quot;. Its bugs and limited updates to the formula of the first game attracted criticism. In 2008, it was followed by a sequel, &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, developed by Bethesda Game Studios.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Fallout 2&quot; is a role-playing video game. The player begins by selecting one of three pre-made characters, or one with player-customized attributes. The protagonist, known as the Chosen One, has seven primary statistics that the player can set: strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility, and luck. Each statistic may range from one to ten, provided their sum does not exceed 40. Two other statistics set during character creation are skills and, optionally, traits. All 18 skills are learned abilities, their effectiveness determined by a percentage value. Their initial effectivenesses are determined by the primary statistics, but three can be tagged and given a 20% boost. Traits are character qualities with both a positive and negative effect; the player can pick up to two from a list of sixteen. During gameplay, the player can gather experience points through various actions. For gathering experience points, the player will level up and may increase their skills by a set number of points. Every three (or four with the Skilled trait) levels, the player can optionally grant themselves a special ability, or perk. There are 69 perks (plus ten &quot;special&quot; perks which can only be obtained through specific means), and each has prerequisites that must be met. For example, &quot;Pickpocket&quot;, which makes it much easier to steal from people by removing the debuffs from pickpocketing them in their line of sight and from stealing larger items, requires the player to be level fifteen, have an agility of eight, and have a steal skill of 80%.

=== Exploration and combat ===
In &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, the player explores the game world from a trimetric perspective and interacts with non-player characters (NPCs). Characters vary in their amount of dialogue; some say short messages, while others speak at length. Certain characters are illustrated with 3D models, known as &quot;talking heads&quot;, during conversations. The player can barter with other characters by trading unwanted valuables or by using gold coins produced by one of the game&#x27;s major factions as currency. The game has fourteen companions that the player can recruit for exploration and combat and can be configured via a menu to determine their inventory as well as their preferred weapons, armor, and combat style, except for dog characters. Unlike the previous game, it is possible to continue playing after beating the main storyline, and the player has thirteen in-game years to explore the world before the game automatically ends due to engine limits.

A new mechanic is reputations, which dictates how the game&#x27;s various factions and settlements view the player character. Having positive reputation with an entity will usually result in rewards from leaders of the community, as well as opening up new questlines or ways to complete certain quests that might not have been available otherwise. Negative reputation will result in many of the community&#x27;s members shunning the player and refusing to work with them and may even cause them to turn hostile on sight.

There are two main quests where completion is required, although the first one can be mostly skipped. The main quests have no time limit unlike the first game, but the player&#x27;s reputation in their hometown will slowly decrease the longer they take to complete the first quest. Some characters give the player side quests; if the player solves them, they receive experience points and occasionally a reward in the form of money and/or goods. The player can utilize the PIP-Boy 2000, a portable wearable computer that tracks these quests. Many quests feature multiple solutions; they can often be completed through diplomacy, combat, or stealth, and some allow solutions that are unconventional or contrary to the original task. Based on how they completed quests, the player can earn or lose karma, which determine how others treat them. The player&#x27;s actions dictate what future story or gameplay opportunities are available and the ending.

Combat is turn based and uses an action-point system, the number of action points that are available depending on certain perks and the player&#x27;s allocation in the agility statistic. During each turn, multiple actions may be performed by the player until they run out of action points. Different actions such as attacking, moving, reloading, interacting with objects mid-combat, and accessing the inventory consume different amounts of points. The player can rapidly switch between two equipped weapons, and may acquire a diverse range of weapons, many of which can target specific areas of enemies. Melee (hand-to-hand) weapons typically have two attacks: swing or thrust. If the player has equipped no weapon, they can punch or kick.

When a player uses up all of their action points, they end their turn and enemies start theirs. If the player survives, they have their action points restored. Injuries and poisons can reduce the number of action points semi-permanently until the player heals themselves with stimpaks, doctor&#x27;s bags, from an actual doctor, or by resting for a substantial period of time.

Organized crime, prostitution, and slavery are major elements of the setting.

==Plot==
In 2241, the primitive town of Arroyo suffers the worst drought on record. Faced with the calamity, the village elder asks the direct descendant of the Vault Dweller, referred to as the Chosen One, to retrieve a Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK) for Arroyo. The GECK is a device that can create thriving communities out of the post-apocalyptic wasteland. The player, assuming the role of the Chosen One, is given the Vault Dweller&#x27;s jumpsuit, a RobCo PIPBoy 2000, a Vault 13 water flask, a spear and some cash to start on their mission.

The Chosen One finds Vault 13, the supposed location of a GECK, devoid of the majority of its former human inhabitants and instead inhabited by intelligent Deathclaws. The Chosen One returns to find their village captured by the remnants of the United States government known as &quot;The Enclave&quot;. The Enclave terrorizes the inhabitants of the continental United States with their supreme arsenal of advanced technology. The Chosen One, through various means, activates an ancient oil tanker and engages its autopilot, thus allowing them to reach the Enclave&#x27;s main base on an offshore oil rig. It is revealed that the dwellers of Vault 13 were captured as well, to be used as test subjects for the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). Vault 13 was supposed to be closed for 200 years as part of a government experiment, making them perfect test subjects. The Enclave modified the FEV into an airborne disease, designed to attack any living creatures with mutated DNA. With all genetic impurities removed, the Enclave (who remain protected from radiation) could take over. The Chosen One frees both their fellow villagers from Arroyo and the Vault 13 dwellers from Enclave control and subsequently destroys the Enclave&#x27;s oil rig, killing Dick Richardson (Jeffrey Jones), the President of the United States, and Frank Horrigan (Michael Dorn), a cybernetic Super Mutant working for the Enclave&#x27;s Secret Service. In the end, the inhabitants of Vault 13 and the Arroyo villagers usher in a new era of prosperity to the dying village with the help of the GECK, turning Arroyo into a flourishing city.

==Development==
Tim Cain announced &quot;Fallout 2&quot; via a Usenet posting in December 1997, and wrote that it &quot;should take 11 months&quot;. Cain later clarified that the sequel entered development before the launch of &quot;Fallout&quot;, as the previous game had &quot;really caused a buzz in the studio about six months before it was released&quot;. According to co-founder of Black Isle Studios Feargus Urquhart, Interplay was experiencing financial difficulties at the beginning of 1998, which according to Urquhart, gave the studio &quot;basically nine months to make the whole game&quot;. In order to reach this deadline, many staff were taken from the &quot;&quot; development team and made to work on &quot;Fallout 2&quot;. Additionally, the development team were also made to work crunch time to make up for a lack of manpower and time.

==Reception==
&quot;Fallout 2&quot; received positive reviews, according to the review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. It was a finalist for &quot;PC Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; during the AIAS&#x27; 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, along with nominations for role-playing game of the year awards from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot;; all were ultimately given to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;. The editors of GameSpot wrote, &quot;A bigger, better &quot;Fallout&quot;, this sequel to 1997&#x27;s RPG of the Year was populated with more characters, more places to go, and more things to do.&quot;

Positive reviewers praised the gameplay, storyline, and worthiness as a successor to the original &quot;Fallout&quot;, while detractors criticized frequent bugs and lack of improvement over the first game. Daniel Morris of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the mix of action and character interaction as well as the non-linear gameplay. &quot;IGN&quot; applauded the developers for the sizable game world, the writing, and &quot;not fixing something that wasn&#x27;t broken.&quot; &quot;Game Revolution&quot; praised the game&#x27;s depth and storyline but criticized its graphics and interface.

===Sales===
&quot;Fallout 2&quot; was a commercial success. In the United States, it secured third place on PC Data&#x27;s computer game sales rankings for the first week of November 1998. It was absent from the weekly top 10 by the following week, but debuted at #20 for the month of November overall. &quot;Fallout 2&quot; sold 123,000 copies in the United States by March 2000. &quot;GameSpot&quot; writer Desslock considered these &quot;very good sales, especially since the overall [worldwide] figures are likely double those amounts.&quot; According to Keza MacDonald of &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, &quot;Fallout 2&quot; was unsuccessful in the United Kingdom; she noted that the game and its predecessor totaled just over 50,000 sales combined in the region.

==Legacy==
In 2013, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; ranked &quot;Fallout 2&quot; number 68 on their list of top video games of all time. That same year, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it as the 28th best role-playing video game ever. In 2015, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; ranked the game #3 on its list of best RPGs of all time.

In retrospect, the designers of &quot;Fallout 2&quot; expressed reservations about the game, with Chris Avellone calling it &quot;a slapdash project without a lot of oversight&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; described &quot;Fallout 2&quot; as &quot;an impressive feat, yet still one that rubbed &quot;Fallout&quot; diehards the wrong way.&quot;

&quot;Fallout 2&quot; was the first game to feature same sex marriage, and one of the first games to include LGBT representation in general.

<doc id="578712" wikidata="Q3334283" url="?curid=578712" title="HMCS Athabaskan (DDG 282)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was an that served in the Royal Canadian Navy from 1972 until 2017. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was the third ship of her class which is sometimes referred to as the Tribal class or simply as the 280 class. She is the third vessel to use the designation .

&quot;Athabaskan&quot; was laid down on 1 June 1969 at Davie Shipbuilding, Lauzon and was launched on 27 November 1970. She was officially commissioned on 30 September 1972 and carries the hull classification symbol 282.

&quot;Athabaskan&quot; completed a refit known as the Tribal Update and Modernization Project (TRUMP) on 4 June 1994. At this time her classification changed from Destroyer Helicopter (DDH) to Destroyer Guided Missile (DDG). She was assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) homeported at CFB Halifax.

==Service==
&quot;Athabaskan&quot; served on MARLANT missions protecting Canada&#x27;s sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and Exclusive Economic Zone. She was also deployed on missions throughout the Atlantic and to the Indian Ocean; specifically, the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea after Iraq occupied Kuwait.

===NATO missions in Atlantic Ocean===
&quot;Athabaskan&quot; participated in several NATO missions, patrolling the Atlantic Ocean as part of Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT) and its successor Standing NATO Response Force Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1). On 2–3 August 1999 STANAVFORLANT force undertook exercises in the Baltic Sea, where Polish Mil Mi-14 helicopter landed upon &quot;Athabaskan&quot;.

===Iraq–Kuwait war in Persian Gulf===
In August 1990, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was hurriedly refitted with several advanced weapons and took part in Operation Friction and in Operation Desert Shield. The weapons included a close-in weapon system (CIWS). &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was appointed flagship of the Canadian Naval Task Group, which included the destroyer and supply ship . The task group served in the central Persian Gulf, with other coalition naval forces, through the fall of 1990.

After Operation Desert Storm began in January 1991, the task group undertook escort duties for hospital ships and other vulnerable naval vessels of the coalition. The detonated two Iraqi bottom-moored influence mines (MANTAs) at the north end of the Persian Gulf and was seriously damaged. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was not assigned to the area, but the commanding officer of &quot;Princeton&quot; specifically requested her assistance. Unlike most ships of her size, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; could simultaneously operate two large CH-124 Sea King helicopters, which could search out mines for long periods. &quot;Athabaskan&quot; and her helicopters helped both ships avoid mines until the minesweeper USS &quot;Adroit&quot; escorted them out of the minefield. As a gesture of solidarity, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; winched over several cases of beer for the crew of &quot;Princeton&quot;, since United States Navy vessels were dry (officially without alcoholic beverages). &quot;Athabaskan&quot; returned to her task group and remained on station in the Persian Gulf until after the war ended. After the hostilities were complete she was relieved by her sister ship . The professionalism of &quot;Athabaskan&quot; earned praise from &quot;Princeton&quot; commanding officer, Captain Edward Hontz.

===Disaster relief in U.S.===

On 2 September 2005, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was one of several MARLANT vessels and a Canadian Coast Guard ship that were deployed to Mississippi and Louisiana to assist disaster relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. This was part of the larger Canadian response to Hurricane Katrina.

===Disaster relief in Haiti===
On 14 January 2010, as part of Operation Hestia, following rapid outfitting &quot;Athabaskan&quot; and were deployed to Haiti to assist with disaster relief efforts after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. This was as part of the larger multi-pronged Canadian Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART). The crew of &quot;Athabaskan&quot; primarily concentrated relief efforts in the city of Léogâne where the crew assisted in triage efforts with the Canadian Medical Assistance Team, cleared rubble within Notre Dame Asylum, built three orphanages and lent aid to five others. Léogâne is a city of 135,000 that was slow to receive relief efforts and was almost completely destroyed by the earthquake. There were an estimated 20,000–30,000 casualties in the city.

===NATO exercises===
After experiencing a series of engine failures and maintenance issues, the ship underwent repairs. The ship was repaired and set sail on 8 September 2015, NATO naval exercises Joint Warrior and Trident Venture with , , , and . However, the starboard cruise engine failed while crossing the Atlantic. The ship sailed to the United Kingdom where she was joined by a mobile repair team which replaced the engine.

In January 2016, &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was outfitted with one of the Canadian Navy&#x27;s first AN/USC-69(V3) antennas under the Short-Term Satellite Communications Upgrade (STSCU) Project. The installation was meant to increase the ship&#x27;s bandwidth prior to sailing on joint exercises with American forces.

In September 2016 &quot;Athabaskan&quot; was among the Canadian warships deployed to the NATO naval training exercise Cutlass Fury off the east coast of North America.

===Fate===
In September 2016, the RCN announced that &quot;Athabaskan&quot; would be paid off in early 2017, leaving the navy without a platform capable of long-range air defence, at least until the introduction of the planned Canadian Surface Combatant. After returning from her last port visit in Bermuda, the ship conducted two days sails for families and past crew members, on 7 and 8 March 2017, respectively. The vessel conducted a final sail past of Halifax Harbour on 10 March 2017, upon which she was paid off and the ship&#x27;s company reassigned to other units. In February 2018 Marine Recycling Corporation secured a -million contract to dismantle &quot;Athabaskan&quot; at their facility at Sydney, Nova Scotia.

==Engine==
In 2009, a man in Nova Scotia discovered one of &quot;Athabaskan&quot;″s pre-1994 refit engines in a shipping container he had been using as a bridge on his property. The man had bought the container for $400 believing it was empty. The engine was originally valued at $2 million.

<doc id="578724" wikidata="Q1304824" url="?curid=578724" title="Wally Wood">
<text>Wallace Allan Wood (June 17, 1927 – November 2, 1981) was an American comic book writer, artist and independent publisher, widely known for his work on EC Comics&#x27;s titles such as &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; from its inception in 1952 until 1964, as well as for &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;, and work for Warren Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Creepy&quot;. He drew a few early issues of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; and established the title character&#x27;s distinctive red costume. Wood created and owned the long-running characters &quot;Sally Forth&quot; and &quot;Cannon&quot;.

He wrote, drew, and self-published two of the three graphic novels of his magnum opus, &quot;The Wizard King&quot; trilogy, about Odkin son of Odkin before his death by suicide.

Much of his early professional artwork is signed Wallace Wood; some people call him Wally Wood, a name he disliked. Within the comics community, he was also known as Woody, a name he sometimes used as a signature.

In addition to Wood&#x27;s hundreds of comic book pages, he illustrated for books and magazines while also working in a variety of other areas – advertising; packaging and product illustrations; gag cartoons; record album covers; posters; syndicated comic strips; and trading cards, including work on Topps&#x27;s landmark &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; set. 

EC publisher William Gaines once stated, &quot;Wally may have been our most troubled artist ... I&#x27;m not suggesting any connection, but he may have been our most brilliant&quot;.

He was the inaugural inductee into the comic book industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1989, and was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Wallace Wood was born June 17, 1927, in Menahga, Minnesota. He began reading and drawing comics at an early age. He was strongly influenced by the art styles of Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, Milton Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, Hal Foster&#x27;s &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot; and especially Roy Crane&#x27;s &quot;Wash Tubbs&quot;. Recalling his childhood, Wood said that his dream at age six, about finding a magic pencil that could draw anything, foretold his future as an artist.
Wood graduated from high school in 1944, signed on with the United States Merchant Marine at the close of World War II and enlisted in the U.S. Army&#x27;s 11th Airborne Division in 1946. He went from training at Fort Benning, Georgia, to occupied Japan, where he was assigned to the island of Hokkaidō.

In 1947, at age 20, Wood enrolled in the Minneapolis School of Art but only lasted one term. Arriving in New York City with his brother Glenn and mother Alma (of Finnish descent), after his military discharge in July 1948, Wood found employment at Bickford&#x27;s restaurant as a busboy. During his time off he carried his thick portfolio of drawings all over midtown Manhattan, visiting every publisher he could find. He briefly attended the Hogarth School of Art but dropped out after one semester. In 1948, he enrolled in the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (now known as the School of Visual Arts), staying less than one year (although he made a number of professional contacts which helped him later).

By October, after being rejected by every company he visited, Wood met fellow artist John Severin in the waiting room of a small publisher. After the two shared their experiences attempting to find work, Severin invited Wood to visit his studio, the Charles William Harvey Studio, where Wood met Charlie Stern, Harvey Kurtzman (who was working for Timely/Marvel) and Will Elder. At this studio Wood learned that Will Eisner was looking for a &quot;Spirit&quot; background artist. He immediately visited Eisner and was hired on the spot.

Over the next year, Wood also became an assistant to George Wunder, who had taken over the Milton Caniff strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. Wood cited his &quot;first job on my own&quot; as &quot;Chief &quot;, a continuing series of strips for a 1949 political newsletter. He entered the comic book field by lettering, as he recalled in 1981: &quot;The first professional job was lettering for Fox romance comics in 1948. This lasted about a year. I also started doing backgrounds, then inking. Most of it was the romance stuff. For complete pages, it was $5 a page ... Twice a week, I would ink ten pages in one day&quot;.

Artists&#x27; representative Renaldo Epworth helped Wood land his early comic-book assignments, making it unclear if that connection led to Wood&#x27;s lettering or to his comics-art debut, the ten-page story &quot;The Tip Off Woman&quot; in the Fox Comics Western &quot;Women Outlaws&quot; No. 4 (cover-dated January 1949, on sale late 1948). Wood&#x27;s next known comic-book art did not appear until Fox&#x27;s &quot;My Confession&quot; No. 7 (August 1949), at which time he began working almost continuously on the company&#x27;s similar &quot;My Experience&quot;, &quot;My Secret Life&quot;, &quot;My Love Story&quot; and &quot;My True Love: Thrilling Confession Stories&quot;. His first signed work is believed to be in &quot;My Confession&quot; #8 (October 1949), with the name &quot;Woody&quot; half-hidden on a theater marquee. He penciled and inked two stories in that issue: &quot;I Was Unwanted&quot; (nine pages) and &quot;My Tarnished Reputation&quot; (ten pages).

Wood began at EC co-penciling and co-inking with Harry Harrison the story &quot;Too Busy For Love&quot; (&quot;Modern Love&quot; #5), and fully penciling the lead story, &quot;I Was Just a Playtime Cowgirl&quot;, in &quot;Saddle Romances&quot; No. 11 (April 1950), inked by Harrison.

===1950s===
Working from a Manhattan studio at West 64th Street and Columbus Avenue, Wood began to attract attention in 1950 with his science-fiction artwork for EC and Avon Comics, some in collaboration with Joe Orlando. During this period, he drew in a wide variety of subjects and genres, including adventure, romance, war and horror; message stories (for EC&#x27;s &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot;); and eventually satirical humor for writer/editor Harvey Kurtzman in &quot;Mad&quot; including a satire of the lawsuit Superman&#x27;s publisher DC filed against Captain Marvel&#x27;s publisher Fawcett called &quot;Superduperman!&quot; battling Captain Marbles.

Wood was instrumental in convincing EC publisher William Gaines to start a line of science fiction comics, &quot;Weird Science&quot; and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; (later combined under the single title &quot;Weird Science-Fantasy&quot;). Wood penciled and inked several dozen EC science fiction stories. Wood also had frequent entries in &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, as well as the later EC titles &quot;Valor&quot;, &quot;Piracy&quot;, and &quot;Aces High&quot;.

Working over scripts and pencil breakdowns by Jules Feiffer, the 25-year-old Wood drew two months of Will Eisner&#x27;s Sunday-supplement newspaper comic book &quot;The Spirit&quot;, on the 1952 story arc &quot;The Spirit in Outer Space&quot;. Eisner, Wood recalled, paid him &quot;about $30 a week for lettering and backgrounds on &quot;The Spirit&quot;. Sometimes he paid $40 when I did the drawings, too&quot;.

Feiffer, in 2010, recalled Wood&#x27;s studio, &quot;which was at that time in the very slummy Upper West Side [of Manhattan] in the [West] 60s, years before it was [the] Lincoln Center [area]. It was a cartoonist and science-fiction writers&#x27; ghetto – just a huge room where the walls were knocked down, dark, smelly, roach-infested, and all these cartoonists and writers bent over their tables. One was [science-fiction writer] Harry Harrison.&quot;

Between 1957 and 1967, Wood produced both covers and interiors for more than 60 issues of the science-fiction digest &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, illustrating such authors as Isaac Asimov, Philip K. Dick, Jack Finney, C. M. Kornbluth, Frederik Pohl, Robert Silverberg, Robert Sheckley, Clifford D. Simak and Jack Vance. He painted six covers for &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction Novels&quot; between 1952 and 1958. His gag cartoons appeared in the men&#x27;s magazines &quot;Dude&quot;, &quot;Gent&quot; and &quot;Nugget&quot;. He inked the first eight months of the 1958–1961 syndicated comic strip &quot;Sky Masters of the Space Force&quot;, penciled by Jack Kirby.

Wood expanded into book illustrations, including for the picture-cover editions (though not the dust-jacket editions) of titles in the 1959 Aladdin Books reissues of Bobbs Merrill&#x27;s 1947 &quot;Childhood of Famous Americans&quot; series.

===Silver Age and Bronze Age===
Wood additionally did art and stories for comic-book companies large and small – from Marvel (and its 1950s iteration Atlas Comics), DC (including &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot;), and Warren (&quot;Creepy&quot;, &quot;Eerie&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;), to such smaller firms as Avon (&quot;Eerie&quot;, &quot;Strange Worlds&quot;), Charlton (&quot;War and Attack&quot;, &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;), Fox (&quot;Martin Kane, Private Eye&quot;), Gold Key (&quot;M.A.R.S. Patrol Total War&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;), Harvey (&quot;Unearthly Spectaculars&quot;), King Comics (&quot;Jungle Jim&quot;), Atlas/Seaboard (&quot;The Destructor&quot;), Youthful (&quot;Captain Science&quot;) and the toy company Wham-O (&quot;Wham-O Giant Comics&quot;). In 1965, Wood, Len Brown, and possibly Larry Ivie created &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; for Tower Comics. He wrote and drew the 1967 syndicated Christmas comic strip &quot;Bucky&#x27;s Christmas Caper&quot;. During the 1960s, Wood did many trading cards and humor products for Topps Chewing Gum, including concept roughs for Topps&#x27; famed 1962 &quot;Mars Attacks&quot; cards prior to the final art by Bob Powell and Norman Saunders. 

For Marvel during the Silver Age of Comic Books, Wood&#x27;s work as penciler-inker of &quot;Daredevil&quot; #5–8 and inker over Bob Powell of issues #9-11 established the title character&#x27;s distinctive red costume (in issue #7). Wood and Stan Lee introduced the Stilt-Man in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #8 (June 1965). When Daredevil guest-starred in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #39–40, Wood inked that character, over Jack Kirby pencils, on the covers and throughout the interior.

Wood penciled and inked the first four 10-page installments of the company&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Doom&quot; feature in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #1–4 (Aug. 1970-Feb. 1971), and both wrote and drew anthological horror/suspense tales in &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; #5–8 (May–Nov. 1970), as well as sporadic other work.

In circles concerned with copyright and intellectual property issues, Wood is known as the artist of the unsigned satirical Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster, which first appeared in Paul Krassner&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Realist&quot;. The poster depicts a number of copyrighted Disney characters in various unsavory activities (including sex acts and drug use), with huge dollar signs radiating from Cinderella&#x27;s Castle. Wood himself, as late as 1981, when asked who did that drawing, said only, &quot;I&#x27;d rather not say anything about that! It was the most pirated drawing in history! Everyone was printing copies of that. I understand some people got busted for selling it. I always thought Disney stuff was pretty sexy ... Snow White, etc.&quot; Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or &quot;The Realist&quot; but did sue a publisher of a &quot;blacklight&quot; version of the poster, who used the image without Krassner&#x27;s permission. The case was settled out of court.

At DC Comics, he and Jim Shooter launched the &quot;Captain Action&quot; comic book series in 1968. The following year, Wood briefly served as inker of the &quot;Superboy&quot; series. Discovering from Roy Thomas that Jack Kirby had returned to DC in 1970, Wood called editor Joe Orlando in an attempt to get the assignment to ink Kirby&#x27;s new work, but that role was already filled by Vince Colletta. That same year, Wood was a ghost artist for an episode of &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;. Wood worked on various series for DC between 1975 and 1977, producing several covers for &quot;Plop!&quot; and inking the pencil artwork of Steve Ditko and Jack Kirby on &quot;Stalker&quot; and &quot;The Sandman&quot; respectively. He worked on the &quot;Hercules Unbound&quot; series as well, providing inks for José Luis García-López and Walt Simonson. Wood penciled and inked &quot;All Star Comics&quot; and contributed to the creation of Power Girl by exaggerating the size of her breasts. Active with the 1970s Academy of Comic Book Arts, Wood contributed to several editions of the annual &quot;ACBA Sketchbook&quot;. In one of his final assignments, Wood returned to a character he helped define, inking Frank Miller&#x27;s cover of &quot;Daredevil&quot; #164 (May 1980). His last known mainstream credit was inking &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #269 (July 1980).

Over several decades, numerous artists worked at the Wood Studio. Associates and assistants included Dan Adkins, Richard Bassford, Howard Chaykin, Tony Coleman, Nick Cuti, Leo and Diane Dillon, Larry Hama, Russ Jones, Wayne Howard, Paul Kirchner, Joe Orlando, Bill Pearson, Al Sirois, Ralph Reese, Bhob Stewart, Tatjana Wood, and Mike Zeck.

===Publisher===
In 1966, Wood launched the independent magazine &quot;witzend&quot; (originally to be titled &quot;et cetera&quot;, a name which had to be withdrawn when Wood was told another magazine had already used this) one of the first alternative comics, a decade before Mike Friedrich&#x27;s &quot;Star Reach&quot; or Flo Steinberg&#x27;s &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot; for which Wood drew the cover and contributed a story. Wood offered his fellow professionals the opportunity to contribute illustrations and graphic stories that detoured from the usual conventions of the comics industry. After the fourth issue, Wood turned &quot;witzend&quot; over to Bill Pearson, who continued as editor and publisher through the 1970s and into the 1980s.
Wood additionally collected his feature &quot;Sally Forth&quot;, published in the U.S. servicemen&#x27;s periodicals &quot;Military News&quot; and &quot;Overseas Weekly&quot; in 1968–1974, in a series of four oversize (10&quot;x12&quot;) magazines. Pearson, in 1993–95, reformatted the strips into a series of comics published by Eros Comix, an imprint of Fantagraphics Books, which in 1998 collected the entire run into a single 160-page volume.

In 1969, Wood created another independent comic, &quot;Heroes, Inc. Presents Cannon&quot;, intended for his &quot;Sally Forth&quot; military readership as indicated in the ads and indicia. Artists Steve Ditko and Ralph Reese and writer Ron Whyte are credited with primary writer-artist Wood on three features: &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;The Misfits&quot;, and &quot;Dragonella&quot;. A second magazine-format issue was published in 1976 by Wood and CPL Gang Publications. Larry Hama, one of Wood&#x27;s assistants, said, &quot;I did script about three &quot;Sally Forth&quot; stories and a few of the &quot;Cannon&quot;&#x27;s. I wrote the main &quot;Sally Forth&quot; story in the first reprint book, which is actually dedicated to me, mostly because I lent Woody the money to publish it&quot;.

In 1980 and 1981, Wood did two issues of a completely pornographic comic book, titled &quot;Gang Bang&quot;. It featured two sexually explicit &quot;Sally Forth&quot; stories, and sexually explicit versions of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, titled &quot;So White and the Six Dorks&quot;; &quot;Terry and The Pirates&quot;, titled &quot;Perry and the Privates&quot;; &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, titled &quot;Prince Violate&quot;; &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, titled &quot;Stuporman Meets Blunder Woman&quot;; &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, titled &quot;Flasher Gordon&quot;; and &quot;Tarzan&quot; titled &quot;Starzan&quot;. A third volume, published in 1983, contained three more sexually explicit parodies of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, titled &quot;Malice in Blunderland&quot;; a second Flash Gordon sendup titled &quot;Flesh Fucker Meets Women&#x27;s Lib!&quot;; and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, titled &quot;The Blizzard of Ooze&quot;.

=== &quot;Panels That Always Work&quot; ===
Wood struggled to be as efficient as possible in the often low-paying comics industry. Over time he created a series of layout techniques sketched on pieces of paper which he taped up near his drawing table. These &quot;visual notes,&quot; collected on three pages, reminded Wood (and select assistants he showed the pages to) of various layouts and compositional techniques to keep his pages dynamic and interesting. (In the same vein, Wood also taped up another note to himself: &quot;Never draw anything you can copy, never copy anything you can trace, never trace anything you can cut out and paste up.&quot;)

In 1980, Wood&#x27;s original, three-page, 24-panel (not 22) version of &quot;Panels&quot; was published with the proper copyright notice in &quot;The Wallace Wood Sketchbook&quot; (Crouch/Wood 1980). Around 1981, Wood&#x27;s ex-assistant Larry Hama, by then an editor at Marvel Comics, pasted up photocopies of Wood&#x27;s copyrighted drawings on a single page, which Hama titled &quot;Wally Wood&#x27;s 22 Panels That Always Work!!&quot; (It was subtitled, &quot;Or some interesting ways to get some variety into those boring panels where some dumb writer has a bunch of lame characters sitting around and talking for page after page!&quot;) Hama left out two of the original 24 panels as his photocopies were too faint to make out some of the lightest sketches. Hama distributed Wood&#x27;s &quot;elegantly simple primer to basic storytelling&quot; to artists in the Marvel bullpen, who in turn passed them on to their friends and associates. Eventually, &quot;22 Panels&quot; made the rounds of just about every cartoonist or aspiring comic book artist in the industry and achieved its own iconic status.

Wood&#x27;s &quot;Panels That Always Work&quot; is copyright Wallace Wood Properties, LLC as listed by the United States Copyright Office which assigned the work Registration Number VA0001814764.

==== Homages and tributes to &quot;22 Panels&quot; ====
In 1986, Tom Christopher, who had been given a copy by Larry Hama at the DC office in 1978 light-boxed the pages, incorporating a non-linear dialogue, and asked Par Holman to ink it. Holman inked and lettered the piece, and the completed art was distributed through Clay Geerdes&#x27; Comics World Co-Op, whose members produced mini- and digest-sized comics. In 2006, writer/artist Joel Johnson bought the Larry Hama paste-up of photocopies at auction and made it available for wide distribution on the Internet. In 2010 Anne Lukeman of Kill Vampire Lincoln Productions produced a short film adapting the &quot;22 Panels That Always Work&quot; into a &quot;film noir&quot;-style experimental piece called &quot;22 Frames That Always Work&quot;. Artist Rafael Kayanan created a revised version of &quot;22 Panels&quot; that used actual art from published Wood comics to illustrate each frame. In 2006, cartoonist and publisher Cheese Hasselberger created &quot;Cheese&#x27;s 22 Panels That Never Work,&quot; featuring bizarre situations and generally poor storytelling techniques. In 2012, Michael Avon Oeming created a &quot;Powers&quot;-themed update/homage to &quot;22 Panels,&quot; making it available for distribution. In July 2012, Cerebus TV producer Max Southall brought together materials and released a documentary that featured Dave Sim&#x27;s homage to Wallace Wood and a focus on his 22 Panels, including a tribute that features a creation using the motif of one of them, depicting Daredevil and Wood himself, in Wallace Wood style – and the Wallace Wood Estate&#x27;s official print of the panels.

===Personal life and final years===
Wood was married three times. His first marriage was to artist Tatjana Wood, who later did extensive work as a comic-book colorist. Their marriage ended in the late 1960s. His second marriage, to Marilyn Silver, also ended in divorce.

For much of his adult life, Wood had chronic, unexplainable headaches. In the 1970s, following bouts with alcoholism, Wood had kidney failure. A stroke in 1978 caused a loss of vision in one eye. Faced with declining health and career prospects, he shot and killed himself in Los Angeles on 
November 2, 1981. Toward the end of his life, an embittered Wood would say, according to one biography, &quot;If I had it all to do over again, I&#x27;d cut off my hands.&quot;

===Biographies, criticism, collections===

&quot;Wally&#x27;s World: The Brilliant Life &amp; Tragic Death of Wally Wood, the World&#x27;s 2nd Best Comic Book Artist&quot; by Steve Starger &amp; J. David Spurlock, is a comprehensive biography. It was published in 2006 by Vanguard, which also publishes collections of Wood&#x27;s comic book work, including &quot;Wally Wood: Strange Worlds of Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Wally Wood: Eerie Tales of Crime &amp; Horror&quot;, &quot;Wally Wood: Dare-Devil Aces&quot;, &quot;Wally Wood: Jungle Adventures&quot;, &quot;Wally Wood: Torrid Tales of Romance&quot;, new editions of &quot;The Wizard King&quot; books, and the &quot;Wally Wood Sketchbook&quot;.

In 2017 and 2018, Fantagraphics Books published &quot;The Life and Legend of Wallace Wood&quot;, a set of two hardcover books (, ), mainly compiled by his former assistant Bhob Stewart over a 30-year period. It is a revised, expanded, and uncensored version of his previous Wood book &quot;Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood&quot; (TwoMorrows, 2003). It features personal recollections of Wood&#x27;s friends, colleagues, and assistants, including John Severin, Al Williamson, Paul Krassner, Trina Robbins, Larry Hama, and Paul Levitz; previously unpublished artwork and photographs; and a detailed examination of his life and career. It was Stewart&#x27;s last publishing project, but he did not live to see it in print.

<text>Edith Chewanjel Masai (born 4 April 1967) is a Kenyan former long-distance runner who specialised in cross country and track races, then road races in her late career. She represented Kenya at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Her best achievements are three individual gold medals in the short race at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships between 2002 and 2004.

She is also known for reaching global top at the age of 35. On the track she was the bronze medallist over 5000 metres at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics and was the 2006 African Champion over 10,000 metres. She has also won silver medals over 10,000 m at the 2007 All-Africa Games and 5000 m at the 2002 Commonwealth Games.

Her track best of 8:23.23 minutes for the 3000 metres, set in 2002, remains the African record for the event. Over the marathon distance, she ran her career best of 2:27:06 hours to win the 2005 Hamburg Marathon.

===Early life===

Masai was born in Chepkoya village, Mount Elgon District. She is the third born from a family of four. She competed during her high school days while at Kibuk Secondary School. She graduated in 1988. She joined Kenya Prisons Service in 1990, known for recruiting many talented athletes. Masai did not, however, achieve anything until 1999, when she became the national cross-country champion, at the age of 32. Consequently, she started training more seriously. She won the Lotto Cross Cup Brussels in 2001 and went on to take bronze in the short race at the World Cross Country Championships that year. She improved upon this the following year, taking the gold at the 2002 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.

Masai holds the 3000 metres African record set in July 2002 in Monaco

She won a bronze medal at the 2003 World Championships. In 2004, she failed at the Kenyan trials for the Olympics, but since she was one of only three Kenyans who had beaten the Olympic &quot;A&quot;-qualifying time in women&#x27;s 5000 metres that year, she was offered a place on the team. Masai herself initially rejected the offer, but joined the team after lengthy negotiations. At the Olympics she dropped out after suffering a hamstring injury. She made her marathon debut at the age of 38, but gave a confident first performance, clocking 2:27:06 to win the 2005 Hamburg Marathon.

Masai has since been shifting from track running to marathon. She won Hamburg Marathon in 2005 and participated it also in 2006 and 2007. In 2006, she won Berlin Half Marathon, setting the fastest half marathon run that year, 1:07:16 minutes. It was also a personal best and a course record. She also set a new 5000 metres Kenyan record of 14:33.84 minutes.

She won 10,000 metres silver medal at the 2007 All-Africa Games. Her time, 31:31.18 is a new World record for women over 40 years old. The previous record was held by Nicole Lévêque of France, who run 32:12.07 in Helsinki in 1994. Masai participated the 2008 World championships marathon in Osaka, Japan, finishing 8th in a race won by her compatriot Catherine Ndereba.

Masai won the 2008 Virginia Beach Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Half Marathon. She won Singapore Marathon in December 2008. she broke up with her agent Dorothee Paulmann. in 2007 and worked independently.

She currently lives in Ngong and Kitale. She coaches the Kenya Prisons Cross Country team. She is a divorced mother of one, her son Paul Griffin Sakit born in 1992 who ran for Louisiana Tech University. Masai retired from competitive running in early 2010 because of a knee injury.

<doc id="578732" wikidata="Q2001465" url="?curid=578732" title="Zawiya (institution)">
<text>A zawiya or zaouia (; ; also spelled &quot;zawiyah&quot; or &quot;zawiyya&quot;) is a building and institution associated with Sufis in the Islamic world. It can serve a variety of functions such a place of worship, school, monastery and/or mausoleum. In some regions the term is interchangeable with the term &quot;khanqah&quot;, which serves a similar purpose. In the Maghreb, the term is often used for a place where the founder of a Sufi order or a local saint or holy man (e.g. a &quot;wali&quot;) lived and was buried. In the Maghreb the word can also be used to refer to the wider &quot;tariqa&quot; (Sufi order or brotherhood) and its membership.

== Etymology ==
The Arabic term () translates literally as &quot;corner&quot; or &quot;nook&quot;. The term was first applied to the cells of Christian monks, before the meaning was applied to a small mosque or prayer room. In the later medieval period, it came to denote a structure housing a Sufi brotherhood, especially in North Africa. In modern times, the word has still retained the earlier meaning of small prayer room in West Asia and the Muslim countries east of North Africa, where it can be used to contrast small prayer spaces with more important mosques.

== Maghreb ==
=== Religious and social functions ===

In the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) the zawiya is primarily a place for religious activities and religious instruction. It is typically associated with a particular religious leader (&quot;shaykh&quot;) or a local Muslim saint (&quot;wali&quot;), who is housed here along with his family. After his death, the zawiya usually houses his tomb, commonly inside a &quot;qubba&quot; (chamber covered by a dome or pyramidal cupola), which is sometimes a shrine that serves as the focus of a minor pilgrimage (a &quot;ziyarat&quot;). Typically, his descendants continue to lead or maintain the zawiya afterwards. Some zawiyas, particularly in urban areas, are simply meeting places for local members of a wider Sufi order or brotherhood (&quot;tariqa&quot;), where they perform activities such as a &quot;haḍra&quot; or a &quot;dhikr&quot;. Some zawiyas, particularly in rural areas, serve as larger complexes which provide accommodation to pilgrims and contain a library, mosque, workshops, and granaries that serve the local community. Such zawiyas also historically mediated disputes between tribes or between local communities and the central government. In some cases zawiyas could provide asylum to individuals and could wield considerable political and commercial influence in the region. They were financed with the help of &quot;waqf&quot;s (also known as &quot;habous&quot;), charitable endowments that were inalienable under Islamic law.

In precolonial times, zawiyas were the primary sources for education in the area, and taught basic literacy to a large proportion of children even in quite remote mountainous areas – literacy rates in Algeria at the time of the French conquest in 1830 were higher than those of European France. Their curriculum began with memorization of the Arabic alphabet and the later, shorter suras of the Qur&#x27;an; if a student was sufficiently interested or apt, it progressed to law (fiqh), theology, Arabic grammar (usually taught with ibn Adjurrum&#x27;s famous summary), mathematics (mainly as it pertained to the complex legal system of inheritance distribution), and sometimes astronomy. These are still operational throughout the Maghreb, and continue to be a major educational resource in the Sahel of West Africa, from Mauritania to Nigeria.

=== History ===

The zawiya as an institution pre-dates the arrival of formal &quot;tariqa&quot;s in North Africa and traces its origins to the &quot;qubba&quot; tombs which sometimes acted as shrines and to the early ribats on the frontier of the Islamic world to which holy men sometimes retired with their followers. The first zawiya buildings in Ifriqiya (present-day Tunisia) were built under Hafsid rule in the 14th century. The zawiyas of Kairouan are believed to be the oldest and are centered around the tombs of local saints. These include the Zawiya of Sidi Sahib (or Abu Zama&#x27;a al-Balawi), founded in the 14th century (though the current building dates from the 17th century), and the Zawiya of Sidi &#x27;Abid al-Ghariani, which was also established in the 14th century. The first formal zawiyas in Morocco were founded under the Marinid dynasty in the 14th century as well, most notably the zawiya built in Chellah by Abu al-Hasan and the Zawiyat an-Nussak built by his successor Abu Inan in Salé. Both examples, partly ruined today, were similar to madrasas in form and function. In Algeria, another major example is the religious complex of Sidi Abu Madyan (or Sidi Boumediene), also founded by Abu al-Hasan and built around the older tomb of Abu Madyan (d. 1197). In Fez, the tomb of Idris II, a &quot;sharif&quot; (descendant of Muhammad) and one of the city&#x27;s founders, was rebuilt in the early 14th and early 15th centuries and maintained by his Idrisid descendants. In Tunis, the Zawiya of Sidi Ben &#x27;Arus and the Zawiya of Sidi Qasim al-Jalizi, two of the most important zawiyas in the city, were both established near the end of the 15th century around the tombs of important saints.

Under the sharifian dynasties of the Saadis and &#x27;Alawis in Morocco, zawiyas became more common, more socially and politically important, and architecturally more elaborate. In Marrakesh, both dynasties built funerary structures and religious complexes around the tombs of what became known as the Seven Saints of the city. The Zawiya of Idris II in Fez was lavishly rebuilt by Moulay Isma&#x27;il in the early 18th century, becoming a major landmark and marking the growing importance of shrines related to the tombs of sharifian figures. During periods of weak central rule Sufi orders and zawiyas were able to assert their political power and control large territories. In particular, during the so-called Maraboutic Crisis in the 17th century the Dila Zawiya (or Dala&#x27;iyya), a Sufi order among the Berbers of the Middle Atlas, rose to power and controlled most of central Morocco, while another &quot;zawiya&quot; order based in the town of Iligh ruled the Sous region. The Zawiya al-Nasiriyya in Tamegroute, which still exists today, also ruled as an effectively independent principality to the southeast during this time.

By the 19th century, zawiyas, both as individual institutions and as popular Sufi &quot;tariqa&quot;s, had large and widespread memberships across the population of the Maghreb. The Sanusiyya tariqa, for example, was widespread and influential in Libya and the eastern Sahara regions. In Tunisia, many zawiyas were patronized and supported by the government of the Husaynid beys. A late 19th-century French source estimated that in 1880 there were 355 zawiyas in Algeria with a membership of 167,019 out of a population of slightly less than three million Muslims in the country. In Morocco, an estimated 5-10% of the population in 1939 were members of one zawiya or another. During the colonial occupations of these countries some zawiyas collaborated with the authorities while others resisted. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, colonial governments in North Africa confiscated &quot;waqf&quot; properties or marginalized the &quot;waqf&quot; system that funded zawiyas as a way of diminishing their power and influence. Their influence and social importance was also undermined in the 20th century due to the opposition of Salafist and Wahhabist movements.

== Egypt ==
Zawiyas and khanqahs were not established in Egypt until the Ayyubids came to power in the late 12th century. They proliferated during the Mamluk period (1250–1517) and the later Ottoman period of Egypt (after 1517), when Sufi brotherhoods were important religious organizations for much of the population. In Mamluk Egypt a &quot;khanqah&quot; was a formal institution typically founded by an elite patron (the sultan or an emir) and not necessarily associated with a specific Sufi order. The term &quot;zawiya&quot;, on the other hand, was for smaller, less formal institutions of popular Sufism that were usually devoted to a specific &quot;shaykh&quot; and a specific Sufi brotherhood. The only surviving building in Cairo which is explicitly identified as a &quot;zawiya&quot; by its foundation inscription is the Zawiya of Zayn al-Din Yusuf in the Southern Cemetery, founded in 1297–98 and expanded in the early 14th century.

== Sub-Saharan Africa ==
In sub-Saharan Africa zawiyas proliferated somewhat later than in North Africa, appearing in conjunction with the development of Sufi brotherhoods and networks across the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. Zawiyas that were established in towns and staging posts along Saharan trading routes played a major role in the dissemination of Sufism and in establishing the influence of certain &quot;tariqa&quot;s. Among the &quot;tariqa&quot;s of major importance in West Africa were the Qadiriyya, a wide-ranging order originally begun by Abdul Qadir Gilani (d. 1166), and the Tijaniyya, whose founder Ahmad al-Tijani (d. 1815) is buried in his zawiya in Fez. Another example, the Muridiyya, was of major importance in the history of Senegal.

== Outside Africa ==

In the rest of the Islamic world, similar Sufi institutions usually went by other names such as a &quot;khanqah&quot;, &quot;takya&quot; (or &quot;takiyya&quot; in Arabic, &quot;tekke&quot; in Turkish), or &quot;dargah&quot; (shrine), though these terms sometimes had more specific meanings. In the early Ottoman Empire, the cognate term &quot;zaviye&quot; usually designated a multi-purpose religious complex that catered to Sufis and served as a place of worship. Many important early Ottoman mosques such as the Green Mosque in Bursa, built in the early 15th century, are examples of this type.

<text>The Piaggio P.180 Avanti is an executive/VIP light transport aircraft, designed by Piaggio Aero and built in Italy. It features twin, wing-mounted turboprop engines, in a pusher configuration. The Avanti seats up to nine people in a pressurized cabin and may be flown by one or two pilots. The design is of three-surface configuration, having both a small forward wing and a conventional tailplane, as well as its main wing, with the main wing spars passing behind the passenger cabin area. The FAI lists it as the fastest propeller-driven aircraft with speed of .

==Development==


A 1980s wave of new-generation planes, developed to appeal to Fortune 500 clients, included Piaggio&#x27;s Avanti and Beech Aircraft Corp.&#x27;s very similar Starship. Engineering studies for the airplane that would eventually be named &quot;Avanti&quot; began in 1979 and designs were tested in wind tunnels in Italy and the United States in 1980 and 1981, conducted by Professor Jan Roskam from the University of Kansas (using Wichita State University&#x27;s wind tunnel and Boeing&#x27;s transonic wind tunnel in Seattle) along with Professor Gerald Gregorek at Ohio State University (using OSU&#x27;s 2D pressure wind tunnel).

Piaggio&#x27;s chief engineer, , filed in 1982 to patent the Avanti design. Beginning in 1983, Gates Learjet partnered with Piaggio to develop a fuselage for the new aircraft (referred to as &quot;Gates Piaggio GP-180&quot;). Learjet&#x27;s design influence can be seen in the steeply raked windshield and the two large ventral delta fins under the tail. At high angles of attack these delta fins provide a nose-down pitching moment and help to avoid a potential stall, and they increase stability in flight by damping yaw and Dutch roll.

Gates Learjet&#x27;s financial problems ended their collaboration in January 1986, but Piaggio continued the project, and the first prototype flew on 23 September 1986. The P.180 Avanti received Italian certification on 7 March 1990 and American certification was obtained on 2 October 1990.

The first 12 fuselages were manufactured in Wichita, Kansas, with H &amp; H Parts and Plessey Midwest, then flown to Italy for final assembly. Avanti Aviation Wichita ran out of money in 1994; the project languished until a group of investors led by Piero Ferrari became involved in 1998. The 100th aircraft was delivered in October 2005 and the 150th in May 2008. Piaggio reported that, as of October 2010, the Avanti and Avanti II fleets had logged over 500,000 flying hours.

An improved Avanti II obtained European and U.S. certification in November 2005. Six months later, 70 planes had been ordered, including 36 by Avantair. Avanti II received type approval for Russia in 2011. The Avanti II featured uprated Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66B turboprop engines and flies about 18 km/h (11 mph) faster, with better fuel economy; and an all-new &quot;glass panel&quot; avionics suite from Rockwell Collins reduced cockpit clutter. In addition to heading, attitude and navigation information, flat panel color liquid crystal displays add collision avoidance (TCAS), ground proximity (TAWS) and real-time graphic weather depiction.

The Avanti is marketed as being faster than other turboprops and many midsized jets, with cost efficiency as much as 40 percent better than market-competing jets, as a result of less drag and a lower fuel burn rate. Powered by the same Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66 engines as the Beech Super King Air 200, the Avanti II is faster than that model. Flying magazine judged the Avanti to be the &quot;Fastest Civilian Turboprop Twin&quot; in 2014, saying &quot;Avanti&#x27;s speed is pretty much on par with Cessna&#x27;s M2, while providing more space and a lower operating cost.&quot;

First flown in 2013, the P.1HH UAV prototype crashed off Sicily in May 2016 after 100 hours of flight tests; a second prototype flew in July 2017 before two others joined. The first Avanti EVO manufactured at the new $150 million factory at Albenga Airport was delivered in 2016, one year after moving production from its previous Genoa Cristoforo Colombo Airport plant.

On 22 November 2018, Piaggio Aerospace entered receivership after declaring itself insolvent as its restructuring plan failed. After the financial crisis of 2007–2008, a key US fractional customer went bankrupt and P.180 Evo sales dropped from a 2008 peak of 30 deliveries to just three in 2018. By November 2018, no P.1HHs were delivered to the UAE and the Italian Ministry of Defence €766 million support for the P.2HH program was frozen as populist coalition partner Five Star Movement prioritized social programmes over defence spending.

On 21 June 2019, the Italian government committed to €716 million in orders to make the business more attractive to a potential buyer: €260 million from the defence ministry for nine new Avanti Evos, plus an upgrade of 19 earlier aircraft; €200 million for engine maintenance; €160 million for the P1HH HammerHead certification completion and at least one system (two aircraft and one ground station) acquisition; and €96 million for logistics support. While the deals should be approved later, two aircraft had been delivered so far in 2019, and two more remain in the backlog.
Three non-binding expressions of interest to buy the aircraft business had been received, 10 for the engine business and 26 for the whole company. The official tender for the sale of Piaggio Aerospace was to start after the summer of 2019.

By December 2020, the fleet surpassed one million flight hours. 246 aircraft have been produced, of which 213 are in service: 96 in Europe, 95 in the Americas, 18 in Asia-Pacific, and four in Africa and the Middle East.

==Design==
The Avanti&#x27;s counter-rotating turboprop engines are placed on a mid-set, high-aspect-ratio wing located just behind the cabin. The three-surface design incorporates both a T-tail and a pair of small, fixed forewings having slight anhedral and landing flaps. On the Avanti II these flaps automatically deploy in concert with the main wing flaps. This reduces the load on the tailplane, even when the flaps are deployed, by reducing the pitch-down moment created by the deployment of the main wing flaps. This in turn allows the size of both the tailplane and the main wing to be reduced. This particular three-lifting-surface configuration was patented in 1982.

The forward wing&#x27;s angle of incidence is slightly greater than that of the main wing, so that it stalls before the main wing, producing an automatic nose-down effect prior to the onset of main-wing stall; its five-degree anhedral (negative dihedral) keeps the stream wash interference clear of the engine inlets, the main wing and the tailplane.

The cabin cross-section varies continuously along the length of the aircraft; the shape approximates an NACA airfoil section, and the slowly changing curve helps prolong laminar flow on the front of the fuselage. Piaggio claims that the fuselage contributes up to 20% of the Avanti&#x27;s total lift, with the front and rear wing providing the remaining 80%. Due to the unusual fuselage shape, the mid-cabin is considerably wider than the cockpit. The front and rear airfoils are custom sections designed by Jerry Gregorek of Ohio State University&#x27;s Aeronautical and Astronautical Research Laboratory to achieve a drag-reducing 50% laminar flow at cruise. The company claims the overall design of the P.180 Avanti II enables the wing to be 34% smaller than on conventional aircraft.

The P.180 is reported to have good fuel efficiency relative to small turbojets flying in the same speed and altitude range. &quot;Flight International&quot; stated:

&quot;The Avanti has no direct turboprop competitors, its closest jet rivals are the Raytheon Premier I and the Cessna Citation CJ2+ ... Piaggio says low-drag laminar flow is maintained to around 50% of the wing chord, compared with around 20–25% for conventional tractor turboprops where propeller wash disturbs the airflow over the wing... specific air range at high altitude is compared with around for current jets or for other turboprops.&quot;

By this estimate, fuel efficiency is 70% better than comparable jet aircraft, although this greater efficiency is achieved only at a relatively slow 315 KTAS and FL410. P.180 Avanti II Specifications now show slightly lower numbers for specific range of .

Interior noise is lower than in conventional turboprop aircraft, because the propellers and engine exhausts are behind the cabin. Piaggio quotes 68 dBA. However, due to the strongly disturbed flow in which the pusher propellers operate, the exterior noise is higher. The exterior noise level and its higher pitched sound has been shown to be the result primarily of the interaction of the turbine engine exhaust flows and the five-bladed pusher propellers (est. +9 dB). On takeoff, the Avanti has been measured at 81.9 dBA sideline noise level, slightly lower than the Beechcraft King Air at 82.8 dBA. This is below FAA stage-3 noise limits, which set a maximum of 89 EPNdB for takeoff. However, the P.180 has been the subject of noise complaints at airports, such as Aspen–Pitkin County Airport in Colorado, as well as Naples Municipal Airport, Florida, where that airport authority determined that it was the noisiest aircraft using the facility. Alan Parker, chairman of the Naples Municipal Airport Authority&#x27;s technical committee, described the Avanti as &quot;irritating loud&quot; and compared the high-pitched sound to &quot;fingernails on a chalkboard&quot;.

The Piaggio P.180 Avanti has a sea-level standard-day maximum-gross-weight takeoff distance of and a landing roll of .

Deliveries were at a high of 30 in 2008, but only two in 2013.

In 2014 Piaggio announced development of an updated version, named EVO. It uses new Hartzell composite propellers, with blades of scimitar configuration. Its wings carry new winglets; aerodynamic improvements have been incorporated, and an additional 60-gallon (400 lb) fuel tank option to increase range to . The company predicts improved climb performance, 250 nmi greater range, and 3% reduction in fuel usage. The revised propeller shape, combined with a lower engine speed, promises a 68% reduction in external noise. Avanti EVO type certification was granted by EASA on 28 November 2014, and by the FAA on 6 July 2015. Projected purchase price was $7.4 million in 2014. By 2021 the equipped price was $7.695 million. The first EVO was delivered in April 2015, with five more to follow the same year.

==Variants==

;P.180 Avanti
:First production variant.

;P180 M
:Military version with a combination passenger/freighter configuration for use as a VIP and light utility transport.

;P.180 RM
:Variant for use in radio calibration.

;P.180 AMB
:Air ambulance variant.

;P.180 APH
:Aerial cartography.
:Variant with improved avionics and engines.

;EVO
:Variant with 400kt TAS and higher useful load.

;Multirole Patrol Aircraft (MPA)
:Initially called &quot;Maritime Patrol Aircraft&quot;, MPA is a variant of the Avanti II with a larger wingspan and bigger fuel tanks. As with the EVO propulsion system, MPA uses more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-66B engines and Hartzell five-blade scimitar propellers. MPA electronics include the &quot;Albatros&quot; mission system from Saab Group and &quot;Pro Line Fusion&quot; avionics from Rockwell Collins.

;Piaggio-Selex P.1HH Hammerhead
:Medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle based on the Avanti II airframe, with an increased wingspan and the ability to carry up to of weapons. The P.1HH HammerHead Mission Management System is based on the Selex ES (now Leonardo S.p.A.) skyISTAR solution. The vehicle&#x27;s first flight took place in December 2013 from Trapani–Birgi Italian Air Force base. 
:The Italian Air Force signed an agreement with Piaggio Aerospace to buy three Unmanned Aerial System P.1HH HammerHead (six aircraft and three ground control stations) with delivery starting from the early months of 2016. United Arab Emirates Air Force ordered eight P.1HH aircraft. On 31 May 2016 the first P.1HH prototype crashed off the Sicilian coast, delaying flight testing for thirteen months during construction of a second prototype. Piaggio flew the second prototype at Trapani–Birgi military airport on 5 July 2017 The UAE was to take delivery of six P.1HHs in 2018 and the remaining two in 2019, however by November 2018, no P.1HHs had been delivered and Piaggio Aerospace requested to be placed into receivership.

; P.2HH
: Piaggio develops with Leonardo, the Italian and UAE Armed Forces a P.1HH successor for 2023, with a new wing, more composite materials, and re-thought systems. With a larger wing and airframe, maximum endurance rose to 30 h, but following the 2018 Italian election, the country&#x27;s €766 million program for 20 aircraft and 10 control stations was suspended.

==Operators==

===Civil===
The Avanti is operated by charter companies and small feeder airlines, and is also used as a business aircraft. The fractional aircraft operator Avantair was Piaggio&#x27;s largest client, with a fleet of 57 Avanti aircraft, before they went bankrupt and the fleet was liquidated.

In May 2017, 220 aircraft were in operation around the world, with 89 being first-generation Avanti, 126 second-generation Avanti II and 6 Avanti EVO models.

A Piaggio Avanti San Diego-to-Charleston flight in 2003, piloted by Joe Ritchie with co-pilot Steve Fossett, set National Aeronautic Association and Fédération Aéronautique Internationale transcontinental speed records with an average speed of , breaking the previous Los Angeles to New York turboprop record of 395.21 knots set by Chuck Yeager in 1986 in a Piper Cheyenne 400LS. Elapsed time for the Avanti&#x27;s coast-to-coast trip was 3:51:52.
