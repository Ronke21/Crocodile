<text>Craggaunowen is an archaeological open-air museum in eastern County Clare, Ireland. It is named for the 16th-century castle which is one of its main components. 

Craggaunowen is located 10 km east of Quin village. The name Craggaunowen derives from its Irish name &quot;Creagán Eoghain&quot; (Owen&#x27;s little rocky hill). The site is operated by Shannon Heritage.

==Open-air museum==
The open-air museum, sometimes described as a &quot;Living Past Experience&quot;, was started by John Hunt on the site around the castle. It containis reconstructions of ancient Irish architecture including a dolmen, a crannog and the currach boat used in Tim Severin&#x27;s recreation of &quot;The Voyage of St. Brendan the Abbot&quot;. It also shows reconstructions of a Ringfort, Fulachta Fia (Bronze Age cooking and industrial site) and Standing Stone (Ogham Stone).

===Castle===
====Origins to ruins====
Craggaunowen Castle was built around 1550 by John MacSioda MacNamara, a descendant of Sioda MacNamara, who built Knappogue Castle in 1467. It was left in ruins in the 17th century, and rendered uninhabitable by the removal of the roof and staircase, and indefensible by removal of the battlements, at the time of the Cromwellian confiscations around 1653.

====19th century====
The Tower House remained a ruin until it and the estate of Cullane House across the road, were inherited in 1821 by &quot;Honest&quot; Tom Steele, a confederate of Daniel O’Connell, &quot;The Liberator&quot;.

Steele had the castle rebuilt as a summer house in the 1820s and he used it, and the turret on the hill opposite, as places of recreation. His initials can be seen on one of the quoin-stones to the right outside. Following his death in 1848 the lands were divided, Cullane going to one branch of his family, Craggaunowen to his niece Maria Studdert. Eventually, having passed through the hands of his descendants, the castle and grounds were acquired by the &quot;Irish Land Commission&quot;. Much of the poor quality land was given over to forestry and the castle itself was allowed to fall into disrepair.

By the time of the First Ordnance Survey in the 1840s, the castle was in ruins again. In the mid-19th century, the castle, herder&#x27;s house and 96 acres were reported in the possession of a Reverend William Ashworth, who held them from a Caswell (a member of a family from County Clare just north of Limerick). 

====20th century and restoration====
In 1906, a mansion house at the site was owned by Count James Considine (from a family based at Derk, County Limerick).

Craggaunowen Castle was bought and restored by antiquarian John Hunt in the 1960s. Hunt added an extension to the ground floor, which for a while housed part of his collection of antiquities. The collection was later moved to the University of Limerick and as of 2022 is held at the Hunt Museum in the city of Limerick.

<text>Box Hill North is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 14 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whitehorse local government area. Box Hill North recorded a population of 12,337 at the 2021 census.

=== Post-war development ===
Although central Box Hill was established in 1861, Box Hill North was largely developed and organised as a suburban area following the Second World War during a period of suburbanisation and development of its capabilities as a residential neighbourhood. Prior to the end of World War II, much of the area remained rural and mostly filled with orchards and dairy farms. As the post-war boom bought further reorganisation and development opportunities, corresponding local public services were developed. The Kerrimuir Post Office opened on 1 April 1955 and Box Hill North Post Office opened on 1 August 1955 as the population increased, requiring more dedicated postal services to meet the demands of an increasing population.

<text>Burwood is an inner eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 14 kilometres east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Monash and Whitehorse local government areas. Burwood recorded a population of 15,147 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The first settlement in the area, known as Ballyshanassy, was surveyed in 1858. The settlement changed name to Norwood and subsequently Burwood in 1879. The Post Office opened on 1 May 1853 as Ballyshanassy and was renamed Burwood around June 1879.

The name &quot;Burwood&quot; (later &quot;Invergowrie&quot;) was the name of a house built by Sir James Palmer, in Hawthorn West, in 1852. The original settlement was centred near Burwood Cemetery and the Police Station, but the focus shifted to the intersection of Warrigal Road and Toorak Road, with later commercial development. The suburb later spread westwards to the Hartwell railway station, which was renamed as Burwood railway station.

By 1904, Burwood had a population of 600 and had a post office, two hotels, a savings bank and a number of churches. The township at that time was surrounded by farms and market gardens. Albers&#x27; Daffodil Farm is typical of the local market gardens and was established in 1934. It operated on the site where Deakin University&#x27;s Burwood Campus is now located, until the site was sold to the government in 1951.

The extension of the Toorak Road tramline in 1912 was a catalyst for residential development in the area. Following World War II, development headed east along Burwood Highway to and beyond the neighbourhood of Bennettswood, where a post office has been open since 2 February 1954.

===Allambie===
The Allambie Reception Centre for juvenile wards of the state was located at Burwood.

===Burwood Boys Home===
Burwood Boys&#x27; Home, originally located at 155 Warrigal Road, was founded in 1895 by Robert Campbell Edwards, who was concerned about the number of children living on the streets of Melbourne. The facility changed its name to Burwood Children&#x27;s Home when girls began to be admitted after 1972. It was closed in 1986. The location is now used for Cameron Close retirement village.

===Orana Methodist Children&#x27;s Home===
In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s the Methodist Church developed residential units (cottages) on the site of 87 Elgar Road, Burwood, for the care of abandoned and neglected children, children that were deemed wards of the state of Victoria. This site was sold and relocated to Meadow Heights in 1989.

===Princess Elizabeth Kindergarten for the Deaf===
The Princess Elizabeth Kindergarten for the Deaf, the first facility of its kind in Australia, was opened on a site at 90 Elgar Road in 1950. It was later known as the Princess Elizabeth Junior School for Deaf Children.

===Vision Australia===
The Royal Victorian Institute of the Blind (now Vision Australia) purchased of land on Burwood Highway in 1951 for a school, which was opened in 1959. This school was closed down in December 2009. The site was also used by St. Andrews Christian College from 1998 to 2010. It has now been replaced Greenwood business park and a large housing development.

===Drive-in theatre===
The Burwood Skyline, opened in February 1954, was Australia&#x27;s first drive-in theatre. Operated by Hoyts, it had a 652 car capacity, later increasing to 743. The drive-in was located near the intersection of Burwood Highway and McComas Grove, in a natural amphitheatre setting, provided by the Gardiners Creek Valley. The screen was located on a high point on the other side of the creek from the viewing area. The first film publicly screened was &quot;On the Riviera&quot;, starring Danny Kaye and Gene Tierney. The drive in was very popular in its early years, often causing traffic jams in the local area. A playground was provided for children, which included a motorised carousel.

Following a decline in audience numbers over a number of years, the drive-in closed on 22 June 1983, with a screening of &quot;We of the Never Never&quot; and &quot;Local Hero.&quot;

<doc id="568990" wikidata="Q5001058" url="?curid=568990" title="Burwood East, Victoria">
<text>Burwood East is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, located east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whitehorse local government area. Burwood East recorded a population of 10,675 at the 2021 census.

Burwood East is bounded by Springvale Road to the east, Middleborough Road to the west, Eley Road and Hawthorn Road to the north and Highbury Road to the south.

==History==

The Wurundjeri Aboriginal clan, one of four Koorie clans that inhabited the Port Phillip region, were the original occupants of the area now occupied by East Burwood. To the east of present-day Middleborough Road, much of the land was initially not very attractive to European squatters for settlement and parts were mostly covered with open forests, consisting of Red Stringybark, Red Box, Long Leaf Box, Candlebark and Manna Gum. Highbury Park contains some of the few remaining stands of remnant vegetation, including the locally uncommon Shiny Wallaby-grass (Austrodanthonia induta).

By the mid 19th century, East Burwood and the surrounding districts were under cultivation and local horticulturists were supplying Melbourne&#x27;s markets, including the Victoria Markets, with cut flowers and produce. Jonquils and Daffodils were harvested in the area well into the 1950s. Apple, cherry and pear groves covered the hill slopes for close to a century. The earliest orchardist was James Tainton who placed 50 acres of land under cultivation in the 1880s. Another orchardist Walter Mock developed the Red Williams&#x27; pear variety in East Burwood during the 1930s. The &#x27;Reds&#x27; found favour and the variety was exported to Europe and North America. However little more than thirty years later, the last of the orchards located in East Burwood had been ripped up or relocated in one case, to Bacchus Marsh.

==Commercial activity==

Burwood East is notable as the site of the first Kmart department store in Australia. The Kmart Plaza store opened in 1969, at the intersection of Burwood Road (now Highway) and Blackburn Road. It was the first 24-hour Kmart store and proved very popular with locals, frustrated with the limited shopping hours on offer at the time. Burwood East Kmart is the second largest in Australia, with a gross leasable area of .

The Tally Ho Business Park, on the corner of Burwood Highway and Springvale Road, hosts the headquarters of many corporations and organisations, including the Country Fire Authority and former regional headquarters of VicRoads and Yokogawa. The site of the Tally Ho Business Park and its surrounds was previously occupied by the Tally Ho Boys&#x27; Home, which was established on land provided at a reduced price to the Methodist Church by Abel Hoadley, the inventor of the Violet Crumble chocolate bar. The Violet Crumble was supposedly manufactured in a Cottage where the ABC now stands.

On the north side of Burwood Highway, there are additional business buildings including a HP building, expanding the business park beyond the boundary of the original Tally Ho Boys&#x27; Home.

Vision Drive (located adjacent to the Tally Ho Business Park) is the current location of World Vision Australia&#x27;s National Office, The GPT Group and the National Archives of Australia (Melbourne Repository).

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 10,273 people in Burwood East. 48.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 14.8%, Greece 4.1%, India 3.6%, Sri Lanka 3.2% and Malaysia 2.7%. 44.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 15.7%, Greek 8.9%, Cantonese 6.0%, Vietnamese 2.3% and Sinhalese 2.2%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.3%, Catholic 17.8%, Eastern Orthodox 10.4% and Buddhism 7.3%.

==Transport==

Burwood East is serviced by public transport:

*703 Middle Brighton – Blackburn via Bentleigh Station, Clayton, Monash University, Syndal Station (every day). Operated by Ventura Bus Lines.
*732 Box Hill – Upper Ferntree Gully via Vermont South, Westfield Knox (every day). Operated by Ventura Bus Lines.
*735 Box Hill – Nunawading via Forest Hill Chase (every day). Operated by Ventura Bus Lines.
*736 Mitcham – Blackburn via Vermont South, Glen Waverley Station, Forest Hill Chase (every day). Operated by Ventura Bus Lines.

Burwood Highway is part of Melbourne&#x27;s Tram Network. Tram Route 75 originally terminated at the intersection of Blackburn Road and Burwood Highway until July 2005, with the completion of the 3 km line extension to Hartland Road in Vermont South. Also, with the introduction of the new Myki ticketing system, the tram zone boundaries have also been extended. This is good news for Route 75 passengers travelling across Zone 1+2, as they now only need to pay Zone 1 fares.

==Sport==

Burwood East is home to the Nunawading Basketball Centre, Nunawading Velodrome, East Burwood/Bennettswood Cricket Club and East Burwood Football Club, on Burwood Highway.

Football has been played in Burwood East since 1915 and local fruit and flower growers produced an abundance of footballers. The club has built a family tradition and families names such as Fankhauser, Tainton and Mullens. Today the club competes in the Eastern Football League.

==Education==

Schools in the suburb include:

* Forest Hill College
* Burwood East Primary School 
* Burwood Heights Primary School 
* Blackburn English Language School 
* Burwood East Special Developmental School

==Local churches==

* Burwood Heights Uniting Church
* Anglican Church of the Ascension
* Crossway

==Tally Ho==

Tally Ho is a locality within Burwood East centred () on the intersection of Burwood Highway and Springvale Road and is approximately 18 km east of the Melbourne Central Business District. Originally a rural area, the neighbourhood is named after a hotel which stood beside a shop on the corner of Blackburn Road and Highbury Road during the 1870s and 1880s. Opposite the hotel a primitive racecourse was constructed, and although the roads were considered in poor repair, activities there attracted large crowds. In October 1888 the hotel was destroyed by fire but later rebuilt but in 1922 moves were made to close the hotel along with a number of others
A small shopping centre now occupies the area where the hotel once stood.

The Tally Ho Boys Home was established nearby by the Wesley Mission of the Methodist Church in 1902. Later closed, it became the Tally Ho Business Park.

==Current and future developments==
The State Government has declared the Burwood Heights area as a &#x27;Major Activity Centre&#x27; because of the easy access to public transport, current uses and the potential for significant development. In March 2008 Whitehorse Council approved a development plan that will see housing for up to 1000 residents at the old brickworks site in East Burwood.

The development will comprise over 25,000sqm of retail floorspace, multiscreen cinemas, up to 700 dwellings, leisure and entertainment and community facilities, all based around &quot;main street&quot; retail/entertainment precinct and urban plaza. The project is scheduled for completion in 2015. Details of the Burwood Heights Activity Center Project are listed . However, the progress of the project is stalled or very slow.

Kmart Plaza has also undergo a facelift, with renovations scheduled to start early 2010. The owners of the Kmart Plaza, also known as the East Burwood Plaza, will double the size of the complex, on the corner of Burwood Highway and Blackburn Road, from 15,000 square metres to 30,000 square metres. The new leasing floor plan can be viewed here.

Pomeroy Pacific development manager Paul Chiodo said the $35 million extension will add about 30 speciality shops, a Coles Supermarket, a 333-seat restaurant, gymnasium and a First Choice bottle shop. The extension will be built over an existing car park, on the western side of the site.

German discount supermarket chain Aldi has leased the supermarket space currently occupied by Coles. Kmart, which occupies about of space and trades 24-hours a day, will not relocate. Construction work is currently underway, with stage 1 completed in 2011, and the centre is named to be &#x27;Burwood One&#x27; .

RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) Burwood East is the largest RSPCA animal shelter in Victoria and features an animal adoption centre, animal shelter, veterinary clinic, animal behaviour training, grooming and education centre. Animal ambulance services also operate out of the Burwood East location. The site is undergoing a substantial re-development, scheduled for completion is mid-2013.

On 10 December 2019, the shopping centre development at the old brickworks site, called Burwood Brickworks, officially opened. Burwood Brickworks notably has a rooftop farm to service an in house Acre Farm and Eatery restaurant, along with housing a Woolworths store. The centre aims to meet the Living Building Challenge requirements, in terms of having zero carbon footprint, no waste, non toxic materials, growing 20% of the food used, and net generation of electricity and water, aimed to be what the developer describes as &quot;the most sustainable shopping centre in the world&quot;. Despite this, in July 2022, &quot;ABC News&quot; reported that the Brickworks establishment had been given approval to allow untreated stormwater to run into Gardiners Creek. The developer, Frasers Property, originally had plans to build a wetland with support from Melbourne Water, but they later reversed their support, calling the proposal unsafe. Environmentalist Karin Traeger has expressed concerns that this decision will result in more pollution ending up in Gardiners Creek, and consequently the Yarra River. She also said that polluted stormwater is one of the main issues affecting the river&#x27;s health. The developer is instead paying $220,000 in stormwater offsets to meet their obligations. 

The adjacent residences are to be completed some time in mid-2021.

<text>Dorothy Canfield Fisher (February 17, 1879 – November 9, 1958) was an educational reformer, social activist, and best-selling American author in the early 20th century. She strongly supported women&#x27;s rights, racial equality, and lifelong education. Eleanor Roosevelt named her one of the ten most influential women in the United States. Her writing helped increase understanding of the Montessori method of child-rearing in the U.S.; she presided over the country&#x27;s first adult education program; and her service as a member of the Book of the Month Club selection committee from 1925 to 1951 helped shape literary tastes in the U.S.

==Biography==
Dorothea Frances Canfield – named for Dorothea Brooke of the novel &quot;Middlemarch&quot; – was born on February 17, 1879, in Lawrence, Kansas to James Hulme Canfield and Flavia Camp, an artist and writer. From 1877 to 1891 her father was a University of Kansas professor with responsibility for various historical studies, and finally president of the National Education Association. Later he was chancellor of the University of Nebraska, president of Ohio State University, and librarian at Columbia University. Canfield Fisher is most closely associated with Vermont, where she and her mother made trips to the family home and where she spent her adult life. Vermont also served as the setting for many of her books.

In 1899 Canfield received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Ohio State University, where she was a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma. She went on to study Romance languages at the University of Paris and Columbia University (where her father was Librarian from 1899) and earned a doctoral degree from Columbia with the dissertation &quot;Corneille and Racine in English&quot; (1904). With George Rice Carpenter from Columbia she co-wrote &quot;English Rhetoric and Composition&quot; (1906). She was the first woman to receive an honorary degree from Dartmouth College and received others from the University of Nebraska, Middlebury College, Swarthmore College, Smith College, Williams College, Ohio State University, and the University of Vermont.

She married John Redwood Fisher in 1907, and they had two children, a daughter, Sally, and a son, Jimmy.

In 1911, Canfield Fisher visited the &quot;children&#x27;s houses&quot; in Rome established by Maria Montessori. Much impressed, she joined the cause to bring the method back to the U.S., translating Montessori&#x27;s book into English and writing five of her own: three nonfiction and two novels.

Another concern of Canfield Fisher was her war work. She followed her husband to France in 1916 during World War I and while raising her young children in Paris worked to establish a Braille press for blinded veterans. She also established a convalescent home for refugee French children from the invaded areas; continuing her relief work after the war, she earned citations of appreciation from Eleanor Roosevelt, Madame Chiang Kai-shek, and the government of Denmark.

== Activism ==
Canfield Fisher engaged in social activism in many aspects of education and politics. She managed the first adult education program in the U.S. She did war-relief work in 1917 in France, establishing the Bidart Home for Children for refugees and organizing an effort to print books in Braille for blinded combat veterans. In 1919, she was appointed to the State Board of Education of Vermont to help improve rural public education. She spent years promoting education and rehabilitation/reform in prisons, especially women&#x27;s prisons.

After the war, she was the head of the U.S. committee that led to the pardoning of conscientious objectors in 1921, and sponsored financial and emigration assistance to Jewish educators, professionals, and intellectuals.

After her son was killed in World War II, she arranged a fellowship at Harvard Medical School for the two Philippine surgeons who tried to save his life.

== Affiliations ==

Canfield Fisher and Willa Cather&#x27;s decades-long relationship intensely revolved around their writing. Their letters, from 1899 to 1947, reveal a lasting and complicated friendship.

Cather wrote a short story that may have satirized Canfield&#x27;s mother, called &quot;Flavia and Her Artists&quot;—sparking ten years of interrupted friendship between Canfield Fisher and Cather.
Other writers who corresponded with Canfield Fisher included Henry Seidel Canby, Richard Wright, Heywood Broun, Witter Bynner, Isak Dinesen, and Robert Frost.

Canfield Fisher worked with the following organizations over the course of her life.
* Adult Education Association
* American Youth Commission of the American Council of Education, 1936–1940
* Book of the Month Club Committee of Selection, 1926 until 1951
* Honorary Committee of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, 1935
* The Lighthouse Organization, 1917
* National Institute of Arts and Letters, 1931
* Vermont Board of Education, 1921

== Personal life and death ==

Her daughter Sally was born in 1909. She married John Paul Scott and they lived in Bar Harbor, Maine. By 1958 she had published 18 children&#x27;s books as Sally Scott. Canfield Fisher&#x27;s granddaughter Vivian Scott also writes children&#x27;s books.

Her son James (Jimmy) was born in 1913 and during World War II became a surgeon and captain in the U.S. Army. He served with the Alamo Scouts for three months at the end of 1944. Afterwards, his Ranger unit rescued Allied prisoners of war at Cabanatuan in the Philippines. Fisher died on Luzon, January 31, 1945.

Canfield Fisher died at the age of 79 in Arlington, Vermont in 1958. Her husband died the following year.

==Legacy==
Until 2020, the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children&#x27;s Book Award was awarded to new American children&#x27;s books whose winner was chosen by the vote of child readers. In 2017, an Abenaki educator lobbied the Vermont Department of Libraries to pull Fisher&#x27;s name from the children&#x27;s literature award, which was created in the state over half a century ago. Judy Dow claimed that Fisher stereotyped French Canadians and Native Americans in her works of fiction, and that she may have been part of the eugenics movement that promoted cleansing Vermont of people considered genetically less desirable in the 1920s and 1930s. Other voices discussed putting Fisher&#x27;s characterizations in context of the times in which she lived. Yet others suggested that because Fisher&#x27;s works are no longer widely read nor is her name well recognized, perhaps it has become time to retire the title of the literature award. 

No direct connection with the eugenics movement was established. The Vermont State Board of Libraries recommended dropping her name from the award on grounds that &quot;it was no longer relevant to today&#x27;s young people&quot;. The state librarian announced in 2019 that the award would receive a new name. The Vermont State Library announced in 2020 that the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children&#x27;s Book Award would be renamed the &quot;Vermont Golden Dome Book Award,&quot; a name selected by Vermont schoolchildren after a student vote.

== Works ==

===Books===
Canfield Fisher spoke five languages fluently, and in addition to writing novels, short stories, memoirs, and educational works, she wrote extensively as a literary critic and translator. For tax purposes, her novels were written as &quot;Canfield,&quot; her non-fiction as &quot;Fisher.&quot;

Her best-known work today is probably &quot;Understood Betsy&quot;, a children&#x27;s book about a little orphaned girl who is sent to live with her cousins in Vermont. Although the book can be read purely for pleasure, it also describes a schoolhouse which is run much in the style of the Montessori method. Another of her books, &quot;The Home-Maker&quot;, was reprinted by Anita Miller&#x27;s Academy Chicago Publishers calling it &quot;way ahead of its time.&quot; In all, she wrote 22 novels and 18 works of non-fiction.

&quot;The Brimming Cup&quot;, her most commercially successful novel, the number two bestseller in 1921 (following only Sinclair Lewis’ &quot;Main Street&quot;), contains a passage discussing unfair treatment of blacks in Georgia; the book has been called &quot;the first modern best-seller to present criticism of racial prejudice.&quot; (As a trustee of Howard University, Canfield Fisher, noted as Ph.B., PhD., D.Litt., delivered the 1946 commencement address.)
William Lyon Phelps said &quot;All her novels are autobiographical, being written exclusively out of her own experience and observation.&quot;

<doc id="568995" wikidata="Q7069760" url="?curid=568995" title="Nunawading, Victoria">
<text>Nunawading () is an eastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 18 km (11 miles) east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Whitehorse and City of Manningham local government areas. Nunawading recorded a population of 12,413 at the 2021 census.

Most of Nunawading is located in the City of Whitehorse, although the City of Manningham governs part of it. It is centred at the intersection of Whitehorse Road and Springvale Road, in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs and is the site of the main office of the City of Whitehorse, as well as large retail (e.g. furniture, auto dealerships, hardware, and electrical) and wholesale businesses, along Whitehorse Road.

==History==

The name Nunawading, thought to be derived from an Aboriginal word meaning either &quot;battlefield&quot; or &quot;ceremonial ground&quot;, was initially applied to a vast area which now incorporates Box Hill, Blackburn, Mitcham, Forest Hill and Vermont.

The township of Nunawading began life in the 1870s as a site of brick and clay production. The name Tunstall, derived from the famed English pottery town, was given to the area, centred at the intersection of Whitehorse Road and Springvale Road. The former name is still reflected in Tunstall Park, on Luckie Street, Tunstall Avenue, off Springvale Road, and the Tunstall Square Shopping Centre, on Tunstall Road, in nearby Donvale. The opening of the Tunstall railway station contributed to the growth of brick and clay industries, with orchards soon following. Tunstall Post Office opened on 1 February 1889 and was renamed Nunawading in 1945.

Following a series of local government subdivisions in the 1920s, the name Nunawading fell from use. The name was reinstated in 1945 when it replaced Tunstall.

The period following World War II saw a housing boom in the area, as residential blocks began to replace orchards. The civic centre was opened in 1968 and became the administrative centre for the City of Nunawading, which was incorporated into the City of Whitehorse, in 1994, along with the City of Box Hill.

==Today==
Whitehorse Road is the site of the largest retail strip for bulkgoods in Melbourne. The City of Whitehorse has named this strip the Mega Mile, in an attempt to provide brand recognition for retailers. Nunawading is home to a large Pacific Brands clothing factory and a brick factory. A large Seventh-day Adventist campus exists on Central Road, including a church, church offices, a retail book shop, Coronella Retirement Village and the coeducational Nunawading Christian College (primary and secondary). There is also a combined kindergarten and primary school, Mount Pleasant Road Primary School, located on Mount Pleasant Road. The head office of Bird Observation &amp; Conservation Australia is in Springvale Road. The suburb was formerly home to the Winlaton Youth Training Centre, the Wobbies World amusement park, and the original Melbourne studios of Network 10 television, where the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; was and still is filmed.

Nunawading has benefited from the new Nunawading railway station, one of the larger metropolitan stations in the eastern suburbs, and the Springvale Road grade separation, in 2010. The southern and northern areas of Nunawading are now more unified, with better access to the Eastern Freeway, which runs along the north the suburb.

The Nunawading Primary School on Springvale Road closed in 2012 and the main building is now the Nunawading Community Hub, which opened in 2020. The new Whitehorse Primary School opened on the site of the old Springview Primary School, and is next door to St. Phillip&#x27;s Catholic primary school. Mount Pleasant Road Primary School, formerly Nunawading South Primary School, is located on the corner of Mount Pleasant Road and Eugenia Street.

==Demographics==
In the 2016 census, the population of Nunawading was 11,876, with 51.6% being female and 48.4% male.

The Nunawading Cricket Club is based at Mahoneys Reserve, in Forest Hill. Competing in the Box Hill Reporter District Cricket Association, the club holds the record number of premierships in the competition and has been the breeding ground of many prominent Australian cricketers, including the Victorian and Tasmanian seam bowler David Saker, after whose ancestors the club&#x27;s main ground is named.

Nunawading is home to the Nunawading Swimming Club, which is the largest swimming club in the Southern Hemisphere.

Nunawading is also home to the Beavers Basketball Team and Nunawading Netball Team. The Beavers currently play section 9 on Sundays and are aiming to win the championship this season under the guidance of ex-Warrior Nick Papaziakas.

Although their home ground, Nunawading Stadium, is in Burwood East, the Nunawading Spectres represent Nunawading in the Melbourne East Basketball Association (MEBA).

<text>Vermont South is a suburb of Melbourne, Australia, 19 km (12 miles) east of its Central Business District. It had a population of 11,954 at the . The eastern boundary is Dandenong Creek, which flows from the Dandenong Ranges through to Port Phillip. The suburb was mostly developed in the late 1960s through till the mid-1970s after developers bought the orchards in the area. Vermont is derived from the French language meaning &quot;green hill&quot;.

== History ==
Before the first European colonialists, the landscape was thickly timbered bushland, occupied by the Wurundjeri, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group. They were hunters and gatherers, camping in the creeks and gullies. After settlers decided their fortune was not to be made in the Victorian gold fields, they turned to the land as there was a living to be made supplying the needs of the fast growing Melbourne. The settlers sweated to clear their land and sold the timber for firewood in Melbourne for 10/- a load. 

Some carefully carefully burned the timber and sold the charcoal instead. The dusty tracks of summer became quagmires in winter. With the money earned they could purchase supplies to bring home on their return journey. Housewives also made butter to sell at Moran &amp; Catos, grocers in Prahran. The settlers split their own timber for fencing and homes. Some homes were built of wattle and daub with bark roofs. The first crops were hay, potatoes and other root vegetables. 

Cash was scarce and barter arrangements were common. The area was first surveyed in 1855 by Clement Hodgkinson, District Surveyor to the Victoria Survey General&#x27;s Office. By the 1880s, apart from some general farming, orchards dominated much of the area&#x27;s landscape.The peak of growing fruit was 1930-1939 followed by a steady decline due to labour shortages and lack of markets during 1939–1945. In 1968, East Burwood was divided into two suburbs; Vermont South and Burwood East. The scheme also rezoned 13 properties (about 424 acres) in Vermont South just north of Springvale Road for residential purposes.Nunawading Council began approving large-scale residential subdivisions with &quot;Residential C&quot; zoning in early 1968. Subsequent rate increases imposed by the City of Nunawading forced many of Vermont South&#x27;s orchardists and farmers to sell their landholdings to developers. 

Council Engineer Bill Sewart drew up a master plan for Vermont South, so as each parcel of land came up for subdivision the plan had to conform with the road layout and other matters set out in the master plan. In conjunction with the Education Department, land was designated for schools - Livingstone and Weeden Drive (Primary) and a secondary site on the south of Burwood Road which ultimately did not proceed. The site was designated for the Shopping Centre, and land between the Centre and Livingstone Road was set aside for &quot;Municipal Purposes&quot;. 

&quot;The Burwood Rise&quot; estate, which occupies a 95-acre area between Livingstone and Stanley Roads and around Dalroy Crescent &amp; Consort Avenue, was developed between 1968-1971 and formed the suburb&#x27;s first major housing project. It aimed to house future customers of the nearby Forest Hill Shopping Centre, which was owned and managed by an affiliate company of Vista P/L;the developer. &quot;One Sunday afternoon my wife and I went for a drive looking to buy a block of land. As we drove down Burwood Highway and crossed Springvale Road we noticed display homes, still wrapped in plastic, along the service road. We pulled over to have a look at this new subdivision which was then called Burwood Rise. There were many appealing qualities to the area, the new primary school, a local shopping centre but the best part of all would have to have been the Burvale Hotel - a pub! After the salesman told me this we purchased a block straight away. This all happened in the year of 1969.&quot; 

- John Mead via&quot;Vermont South Community House: Celebrating 20 years involvement in the local community 1976-1996&quot;. 
== Commercial ==
In 1967, a company lead by Samuel Jacobson announced that they would establish a modern, car-oriented hotel/motel complex at the north-east corner of the Burwood Highway and Springvale Road. Works commenced in the second half of 1968 and the premises opened in 1969. The Burvale was popular as a live music venue during the 1970s, performances there included a concert by AC/DC in December 1975. A heritage overlay was proposal by Whitehorse Council in 2015 but was ultimately overlooked.

The Vermont South Shopping Centre opened on 22nd October 1974 and was designed by commercial architects Millar &amp; Bernard Brown. The car-oriented centre originally had 40 specialty stores, a Venture department store, a Coles New World supermarket, a Chinese restaurant and a Mobil service station. The centre was given a highly anticipated overhaul in 2021 which included an internal and external repaint, removal of the aged carpet in favour of wooden flooring and replacement of the dilapidated facia and canopies. Shortly after renovations were completed, $10 million was invested into upgrading the 4216m2 Coles supermarket, which received a new deli, bakery, fresh food section and upgraded click-and-collect facilities. 

In 1994, Shell proposed plans to subdivide the site for a 24-hour petrol station, McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, Blockbuster, a cafe and several shops. The proposal caused controversy and objectors claimed it was a conflict of interest for the council as the sale of the land was conditional on council approving the subdivision. This was completed between 1995 and 1996.

In 2005, construction began at Burwood Highway of the largest Bunnings warehouse in Australia at the time - creating more than 200 jobs for the local community and representing an investment of $25 million. The 16,550m2 site includes a 9,858 main warehouse, a 1,880m2 under cover timber drive-through, a 3,540m2 nursery and 450 car spaces. The main store has approximately 979 bays (or 3 km) of merchandise and featured in a &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; special&quot;.&quot; A 2,030m2 Officeworks with 49 parking spaces was completed next to the Bunnings in 2012.

=== Neighbours ===
The year 1988 marked the debut of a new Channel Ten TV series that would go on to achieve notable longevity: a teen-oriented soap opera simply titled Neighbours. Filming took place at the Forest Hill studios, where the old Holiday Island set was repurposed to represent the fictional Lasseter&#x27;s Hotel complex. Location filming was primarily focused on the nearby cul-de-sac, Pin Oak Court, which has stood in for the fictional Ramsay Street for over a quarter of a century. Other locations in the fictional city of Erinsborough include a house in Huskey Court (Beverley Marshall&#x27;s house), the Saxonwood Apartments building (Karl&#x27;s Apartment), Biralee Pre-School (India&#x27;s Pre-School), Weeden Heights Primary School (‘Erinsborough Primary School’) and the Burvale Hotel. Singer-songwriter Adele visited Pin Oak Court in March 2017.

In 1971, Deacon co-starred, along with Elaine Joyce, in the final episode of &quot;Green Acres,&quot; which was a backdoor pilot for a proposed sitcom titled &quot;The Blonde&quot; or &quot;Carol&quot;. Joyce played Oliver&#x27;s former &quot;dizzy blonde&quot; secretary, Carol Rush, who now lives in Los Angeles with her sister and brother-in-law. Deacon played her no-nonsense boss, Mr. Oglethorpe, whom Carol manages to save from a real estate scam. The pilot was not picked up.

In 1969, he co-starred on Broadway as &quot;Horace Vandergelder&quot; in the long-running musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, reuniting him onstage with Diller, who played the title character.

Deacon appeared on the &quot;Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour&quot; in 1983 as a game show participant / celebrity guest star.

In 1983, Deacon reprised his role of Fred Rutherford in the television movie &quot;Still the Beaver&quot;, a sequel to the original TV series. When the television movie spawned a series of the same name on The Disney Channel, he was to reprise the role but died weeks before the series began production.

In 1984, Deacon had a cameo role in the teen comedy film &quot;Bad Manners&quot;.

==Personal life==
Although he was born in Philadelphia, he and his family later moved to Binghamton, New York, living on the west side of that city. He attended West Junior High and Binghamton Central High School, where fellow Binghamton resident Rod Serling was a classmate. After high school, he worked as an orderly at Binghamton General Hospital.

During World War II, Deacon served in the United States Army medical corps. In 1946, upon completion of his service, he returned to Binghamton. He attended Ithaca College, first as a medical student, but later developed an interest in acting. In 1949, Deacon, along with several other male actors, was admitted to Bennington College as a student/assistant in the drama department.

Deacon was a gourmet chef in addition to working as an actor. In the 1970s and 1980s, he wrote a series of cookbooks and hosted a Canadian television series on microwave oven cooking.

While not widely known during Deacon&#x27;s lifetime, he was a charitable man. At his memorial service, a number of people previously unknown to Deacon&#x27;s friends and colleagues spoke of how Deacon had provided for needy people and charitable organizations during his life.

According to academic writers David L. Smith and Sean Griffin, Deacon was gay, and was among &quot;a number of actors and actresses who were closeted homosexuals&quot; working in Hollywood and often employed in Disney films.

==Death==
Deacon died of cardiovascular disease on August 8, 1984, at age 62. His remains were cremated and the ashes scattered at sea.

<text>Gmail is the email service provided by Google. it had 1.5 billion active users worldwide, making it the largest email service in the world. It also provides a webmail interface, accessible through a web browser, and is also accessible through the official mobile application. Google also supports the use of third-party email clients via the POP and IMAP protocols.

At its launch in 2004, Gmail (or Google Mail at the time) provided a storage capacity of one gigabyte per user, which was significantly higher than its competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage for free for individual users, which is divided among other Google services, such as Google Drive, and Google Photos. Users in need of more storage can purchase Google One to increase this 15 GB limit across most Google services. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, and can send emails up to 25 megabytes. Gmail supports integration with Google Drive, allowing for larger attachments. Gmail has a search-oriented interface and supports a &quot;conversation view&quot; similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax.

Google&#x27;s mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter spam and malware and, prior to June 2017, to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates with concerns over unlimited data retention, ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage. The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must &quot;necessarily expect&quot; their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the end of the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services.

==Features==

===Storage===
On April 1, 2004, Gmail was launched with one gigabyte (GB) of storage space, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time.
The limit was doubled to two gigabytes of storage on April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail. Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would &quot;keep giving people more space forever.&quot;

In October 2007, Gmail increased storage to 4 gigabytes, after recent changes from competitors Yahoo and Microsoft.
On April 24, 2012, Google announced the increase of storage included in Gmail from 7.5 to 10 gigabytes (&quot;and counting&quot;) as part of the launch of Google Drive.
On May 13, 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive, and Google+ Photos, allowing users 15 gigabytes of included storage among three services.
On August 15, 2018, Google launched Google One, a service where users can pay for additional storage, shared among Gmail, Google Drive and Google Photos, through a monthly subscription plan. , storage of up to 15 gigabytes is included, and paid plans are available for up to 2 terabytes for personal use.

There are also storage limits to individual Gmail messages. Initially, one message, including all attachments, could not be larger than 25 megabytes. This was changed in March 2017 to allow receiving an email of up to 50 megabytes, while the limit for sending an email stayed at 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message.

===Interface===
The Gmail user interface initially differed from other web-mail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails, grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later copied by its competitors. Gmail&#x27;s user interface designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places.

Gmail&#x27;s interface also makes use of &#x27;labels&#x27; (tags) – that replace the conventional folders and provide a more flexible method of organizing emails; filters for automatically organizing, deleting or forwarding incoming emails to other addresses; and importance markers for automatically marking messages as &#x27;important&#x27;.

In November 2011, Google began rolling out a redesign of its interface that &quot;simplified&quot; the look of Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall Google design change. Majorly redesigned elements included a streamlined conversation view, configurable density of information, new higher-quality themes, a resizable navigation bar with always-visible labels and contacts, and better search. Users were able to preview the new interface design for months prior to the official release, as well as revert to the old interface, until March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert and completed the transition to the new design for all users.

In May 2013, Google updated the Gmail inbox with tabs which allow the application to categorize the user&#x27;s emails. The five tabs are: Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums. In addition to customization options, the entire update can be disabled, allowing users to return to the traditional inbox structure.

In April 2018, Google introduced a new web UI for Gmail. The new redesign follows Google&#x27;s Material Design, and changes in the user interface include the use of Google&#x27;s Product Sans font. Other updates include a &quot;Confidential mode&quot;, which allows the sender to set an expiration date for a sensitive message or to revoke it entirely, integrated rights management and two-factor authentication.

On 16 November 2020, Google announced new settings for smart features and personalization in Gmail. Under the new settings users were given control of their data in Gmail, Chat, and Meet, offering smart features like Smart Compose and Smart Reply.

On 6 April 2021, Google rolled out Google Chat and Room (early access) feature to all Gmail users.

On 28 July 2022, Google rolled out Material You to all Gmail users.

===Spam filter===

Gmail&#x27;s spam filtering features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as spam, this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users.

In the April 2018 update, the spam filtering banners got a redesign, with bigger and bolder lettering.

===Gmail Labs===

The Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail. Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them. This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity.

Popular features, like the &quot;Undo Send&quot; option, often &quot;graduate&quot; from Gmail Labs to become a formal setting in Gmail.

All Labs features are experimental and are subject to termination at any time.

===Search===

Gmail incorporates a search bar for searching emails. The search bar can also search contacts, files stored in Google Drive, events from Google Calendar, and Google Sites.

In May 2012, Gmail improved the search functionality to include auto-complete predictions from the user&#x27;s emails.

Gmail&#x27;s search functionality does not support searching for word fragments (also known as &#x27;substring search&#x27; or partial word search). Workarounds exist.

===Language support===

, the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including: Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian (Bokmål), Odia, Persian, Polish, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh and Zulu.

====Language input styles====

In October 2012, Google added over 100 virtual keyboards, transliterations, and input method editors to Gmail, enabling users different types of input styles for different languages in an effort to help users write in languages that are not &quot;limited by the language of your keyboard.&quot;

In October 2013, Google added handwriting input support to Gmail.

In August 2014, Gmail became the first major email provider to let users send and receive emails from addresses with accent marks and letters from outside the Latin alphabet.

==Platforms==

===Web browsers===

The modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari web browsers on a rolling basis.

Gmail&#x27;s &quot;basic HTML&quot; version works on almost all browsers. This version of Gmail has been discontinued from January 2024.

In August 2011, Google introduced Gmail Offline, an HTML5-powered app for providing access to the service while offline. Gmail Offline runs on the Google Chrome browser and can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.

In addition to the native apps on iOS and Android, users can access Gmail through the web browser on a mobile device.

===Mobile===

Gmail has native applications for iOS devices (including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) and for Android devices.

In November 2014, Google introduced functionality in the Gmail Android app that enabled sending and receiving emails from non-Gmail addresses (such as Yahoo! Mail and Outlook.com) through POP or IMAP.

In November 2016, Google redesigned the Gmail app for the iOS platform, bringing the first complete visual overhaul in &quot;nearly four years&quot;. The update added much more use of colors, sleeker transitions, and the addition of several &quot;highly-requested&quot; features, including Undo Send, faster search with instant results and spelling suggestions, and Swipe to Archive/Delete.

In May 2017, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from phishing attacks. Media outlets noticed that the new protection was announced amid a widespread phishing attack on a combination of Gmail and Google&#x27;s Docs document service that occurred on the same day.

Later in May, Google announced the addition of &quot;Smart Reply&quot; to Gmail on Android and iOS. &quot;Smart Reply&quot;, a feature originally launched for Google&#x27;s Inbox by Gmail service, scans a message for information and uses machine intelligence to offer three responses the user can optionally edit and send. The feature is limited to the English language at launch, with additional support for Spanish, followed by other languages arriving later.

Inbox by Gmail, another app from the Gmail team, was also available for iOS and Android devices. It was discontinued in April 2019.

Third-party programs can be used to access Gmail, using the POP or IMAP protocols. In 2019, Google rolled out dark mode for its mobile apps in Android and iOS.

==Inbox by Gmail==
In October 2014, Google introduced Inbox by Gmail on an invitation-only basis. Developed by the Gmail team, but serving as a &quot;completely different type of inbox&quot;, the service is made to help users deal with the challenges of an active email. Citing issues such as distractions, difficulty in finding important information buried in messages, and receiving more emails than ever, Inbox by Gmail has several important differences from Gmail, including bundles that automatically sort emails of the same topic together, highlights that surface key information from messages, and reminders, assists, and snooze, that help the user in handling incoming emails at appropriate times.

Inbox by Gmail became publicly available in May 2015. In September 2018, Google announced it would end the service at the end of March 2019, most of its key features having been incorporated into the standard Gmail service. The service was discontinued on April 2, 2019.

==Integration with Google products==

In August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail&#x27;s Google Chat interface. The feature initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as both &quot;Google Voice in Gmail chat&quot; and &quot;Call Phones in Gmail&quot;. The service logged over one million calls in 24 hours. In March 2014, Google Voice was discontinued, and replaced with functionality from Google Hangouts, another communication platform from Google.

On February 9, 2010, Google commenced its new social networking tool, Google Buzz, which integrated with Gmail, allowing users to share links and media, as well as status updates. Google Buzz was discontinued in October 2011, replaced with new functionality in Google+, Google&#x27;s then-new social networking platform.

Gmail was integrated with Google+ in December 2011, as part of an effort to have all Google information across one Google account, with a centralized Google+ user profile. Backlash from the move caused Google to step back and remove the requirement of a Google+ user account, keeping only a private Google account without a public-facing profile, starting in July 2015.

In May 2013, Google announced the integration between Google Wallet and Gmail, which would allow Gmail users to send money as email attachments. Although the sender must use a Gmail account, the recipient does not need to be using a Gmail address. The feature has no transaction fees, but there are limits to the amount of money that can be sent. Initially only available on the web, the feature was expanded to the Android app in March 2017, for people living in the United States.

In September 2016, Google released Google Trips, an app that, based on information from a user&#x27;s Gmail messages, automatically generates travel cards. A travel card contains itinerary details, such as plane tickets and car rentals, and recommends activities, food and drinks, and attractions based on location, time, and interests. The app also has offline functionality. In April 2017, Google Trips received an update adding several significant features. The app now also scans Gmail for bus and train tickets, and allows users to manually input trip reservations. Users can send trip details to other users&#x27; email, and if the recipient also has Google Trips, the information will be automatically available in their apps as well.

==Security==

===History===

Google has supported the secure HTTPS since the day it launched. In the beginning, it was only default on the login page, a reason that Google engineer Ariel Rideout stated was because HTTPS made &quot;your mail slower&quot;. However, users could manually switch to secure HTTPS mode inside the inbox after logging in. In July 2008, Google simplified the ability to manually enable secure mode, with a toggle in the settings menu.

In 2007, Google fixed a cross-site scripting security issue that could let attackers collect information from Gmail contact lists.

In January 2010, Google began rolling out HTTPS as the default for all users.

In June 2012, a new security feature was introduced to protect users from state-sponsored attacks. A banner will appear at the top of the page that warns users of an unauthorized account compromise.

In March 2014, Google announced that an encrypted HTTPS connection would be used for the sending and receiving of all Gmail emails, and &quot;every single email message you send or receive —100% of them —is encrypted while moving internally&quot; through the company&#x27;s systems.

Whenever possible, Gmail uses transport layer security (TLS) to automatically encrypt emails sent and received. On the web and on Android devices, users can check if a message is encrypted by checking if the message has a closed or open red padlock.

Gmail automatically scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails for viruses in email attachments. For security reasons, some file types, including executables, are not allowed to be sent in emails.

At the end of May 2017, Google announced that it had applied machine learning technology to identify emails with phishing and spam, having a 99.9% detection accuracy. The company also announced that Gmail would selectively delay some messages, approximately 0.05% of all, to perform more detailed analysis and aggregate details to improve its algorithms.

In November 2020, Google started adding click-time link protection by redirecting clicked links to Google in official Gmail clients.

===Third-party encryption in transit===

In Google&#x27;s Transparency Report under the Safer email section, it provides information on the percentage of emails encrypted in transit between Gmail and third-party email providers.

===Two-step verification===

Gmail supports two-step verification, an optional additional measure for users to protect their accounts when logging in.

Once enabled, users are required to verify their identity using a second method after entering their username and password when logging in on a new device. Common methods include entering a code sent to a user&#x27;s mobile phone through a text message, entering a code using the Google Authenticator smartphone app, responding to a prompt on an Android/iOS device or by inserting a physical security key into the computer&#x27;s USB port.

Using a security key for two-step verification was made available as an option in October 2014.

===24-hour lockdowns===

If an algorithm detects what Google calls &quot;abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised&quot;, the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include:
* Receiving, deleting, or downloading large amounts of mail from POP/IMAP client within a short period of time.
* Sending a large number of messages which fail to deliver.
* Using software which automatically logs into one&#x27;s account.
* Leaving multiple instances of Gmail open.

===Anti-child pornography policy===
Google combats child pornography through Gmail&#x27;s servers in conjunction with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) to find children suffering abuse around the world. In collaboration with the NCMEC, Google creates a database of child pornography pictures. Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash. Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes. When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the appropriate national authorities.

==History==
The idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public. The project was known by the code name &quot;Caribou&quot;. During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google&#x27;s own engineers. This changed once the project improved, and by early 2004, most employees were using it to access the company&#x27;s internal email system.

Gmail was announced to the public by Google on April 1, 2004, as a limited beta release.

In November 2006, Google began offering a Java-based application of Gmail for mobile phones.

In October 2007, Google began a process of rewriting parts of the code that Gmail used, which would make the service faster and add new features, such as custom keyboard shortcuts and the ability to bookmark specific messages and email searches. Gmail also added IMAP support in October 2007.

An update around January 2008 changed elements of Gmail&#x27;s use of JavaScript, and resulted in the failure of a third-party script some users had been using. Google acknowledged the issue and helped users with workarounds.

Gmail exited the beta status on July 7, 2009.

Prior to December 2013, users had to approve to see images in emails, which acted as a security measure. This changed in December 2013, when Google, citing improved image handling, enabled images to be visible without user approval. Images are now routed through Google&#x27;s secure proxy servers rather than the original external host servers. &quot;MarketingLand&quot; noted that the change to image handling means email marketers will no longer be able to track the recipient&#x27;s IP address or information about what kind of device the recipient is using. However, &quot;Wired&quot; stated that the new change means senders can track the time when an email is first opened, as the initial loading of the images requires the system to make a &quot;callback&quot; to the original server.

===Growth===

In June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally. In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had 900 million active users, 75% of whom were using the service on mobile devices. In February 2016, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1 billion active users. In July 2017, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1.2 billion active users.

In the business sector, &quot;Quartz&quot; reported in August 2014 that, among 150 companies checked in three major categories in the United States (Fortune 50 largest companies, mid-size tech and media companies, and startup companies from the last Y Combinator incubator class), only one Fortune 50 company used Gmail – Google itself – while 60% of mid-sized companies and 92% of startup companies were using Gmail.

In May 2014, Gmail became the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion installations on Android devices.

=== Gamil Design company and misspellings ===
Before the introduction of Gmail, the website of product and graphic design from Gamil Design in Raleigh, North Carolina, received 3,000 hits per month. In May 2004, a Google engineer who had accidentally gone to the Gamil site a number of times contacted the company and asked if the site had experienced an increase in traffic. In fact, the site&#x27;s activity had doubled. Two years later, with 600,000 hits per month, the Internet service provider wanted to charge more, and Gamil posted the message on its site &quot;You may have arrived here by misspelling Gmail. We understand. Typing fast is not our strongest skill. But since you&#x27;ve typed your way here, let&#x27;s share.&quot;

==Google Workspace==
As part of Google Workspace (formerly &quot;G Suite&quot;), Google&#x27;s business-focused offering, Gmail comes with additional features, including:
* Email addresses with the customer&#x27;s domain name (@yourcompany.com)
* 99.9% guaranteed uptime with zero scheduled downtime for maintenance
* Either 30 GB or unlimited storage shared with Google Drive, depending on the plan
* 24/7 phone and email support
* Synchronization compatibility with Microsoft Outlook and other email providers
* Support for add-ons that integrate third-party apps purchased from the Google Workspace Marketplace with Gmail

==Reception==
Gmail is noted by web developers for its early adoption of Ajax.

===Awards===

Gmail was ranked second in &quot;PC World&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Products of 2005&quot;, behind Firefox. Gmail also won &#x27;Honorable Mention&#x27; in the Bottom Line Design Awards 2005. In September 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; declared Gmail to be the best webmail application for small businesses. In November 2006, Gmail received PC World&#x27;s 4-star rating.

==Criticism==
===Privacy===

Google has one privacy policy that covers all of its services.

Google claims that they &quot;will not target ads based on sensitive information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.&quot;

===Automated scanning of email content===

Google&#x27;s mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including filtering spam and malware, and (until 2017) adding context-sensitive advertisements next to emails.

Privacy advocates raised concerns about this practice; concerns included that allowing email content to be read by a machine (as opposed to a person) can allow Google to keep unlimited amounts of information forever; the automated background scanning of data raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email usage will be reduced or eroded; information collected from emails could be retained by Google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users; emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to Google&#x27;s privacy policy or terms of service; Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally, and for minor changes to the policy it can do so without informing users; in court cases, governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications; at any time, Google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services; and any internal security problem on Google&#x27;s systems can potentially expose many – or all – of its users.

In 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations also voiced their concerns about Google&#x27;s plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third-party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.

On June 23, 2017, Google announced that, later in 2017, it would phase out the scanning of email content to generate contextual advertising, relying on personal data collected through other Google services instead. The company stated that this change was meant to clarify its practices and quell concerns among enterprise G Suite (now Google Workspace) customers who felt an ambiguous distinction between the free consumer and paid professional variants, the latter being advertising-free.

===Lawsuits===

In March 2011, a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google, claiming that its Gmail service violates users&#x27; privacy by scanning e-mail messages to serve relevant ads.

In July 2012, some California residents filed two class action lawsuits against Google and Yahoo!, claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual non-Gmail or non-Yahoo! email users to Gmail and Yahoo! recipients without the senders&#x27; knowledge, consent or permission. A motion filed by Google&#x27;s attorneys in the case concedes that Gmail users have &quot;no expectation of privacy&quot;.

A court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August 2013 revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails. In response to a lawsuit filed in May 2013, Google explained:&quot;... all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing ...  Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient&#x27;s assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient&#x27;s ECS [electronic communications service] provider in the course of delivery.A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August 15, 2013, that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users &quot;very seriously&quot;.

===April 2014 Terms of service update===
Google updated its terms of service for Gmail in April 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content. The relevant revision states: &quot;Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.&quot; A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies &quot;to be simple and easy for users to understand.&quot;

In response to the update, Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, stated: &quot;The really dangerous things that Google is doing are things like the information held in Analytics, cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts&quot;.

===Microsoft ad campaign against Google===
In 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy &quot;Google&#x27;s kryptonite&quot;. In response, Google stated; &quot;We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant ... No humans read your e-mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information. An automated algorithm — similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering — determines which ads are shown.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; cites &quot;Google supporters&quot;, who say that &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s ads are distasteful, the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products&quot;.

===Other privacy issues===

====2010 attack from China====
In January 2010, Google detected a &quot;highly sophisticated&quot; cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China. The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been &quot;routinely accessed by third parties&quot;. Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that &quot;at least&quot; 20 other large companies from a &quot;wide range of businesses&quot; - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors – had been similarly targeted. Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities. In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails.

====Social network integration====
The February 2010 launch of Google Buzz, a now defunct social network linked to Gmail, immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users&#x27; contacts unless the default settings were changed. A new Gmail feature was launched in January 2014, whereby users could email people with Google+ accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient. Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the feature &quot;troubling&quot;, and compared it to the initial privacy flaw of Google Buzz&#x27;s launch.

====Update to DoubleClick privacy policy====
In June 2016, Julia Angwin of ProPublica wrote about Google&#x27;s updated privacy policy, which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services. This change has allowed Google to merge users&#x27; personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user. After publication of the article, Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting.

===Outages===
Gmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009, causing doubts about the reliability of its service. It suffered a new outage on February 28, 2011, in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to seem empty. Google stated in a blog post that &quot;email was never lost&quot; and restoration was in progress. Other outages occurred on April 17, 2012, September 24, 2013, January 24, 2014, January 29, 2019 and August 20, 2020.

Google has stated that &quot;Gmail remains more than 99.9% available to all users, and we&#x27;re committed to keeping events like [the 2009 outage] notable for their rarity.&quot;

===&quot;On behalf of&quot; tag===
In May 2009, Farhad Manjoo wrote on &quot;The New York Times&quot; blog about Gmail&#x27;s &quot;on behalf of&quot; tag. Manjoo explained: &quot;The problems &quot;[sic]&quot; is, when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you&#x27;re actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail. If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he&#x27;ll see a message like, &#x27;From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com. Manjoo further wrote that &quot;Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn&#x27;t arouse suspicion by spam checking software&quot;. The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the &quot;On behalf of&quot; tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail&#x27;s servers.

<text>AMOS or Advanced Mortar System is a Finno-Swedish 120 mm semi-automatic twin barrelled, breech loaded
mortar turret. AMOS has been fitted to a wide range of armoured vehicles, such as the Sisu Pasi, Patria AMV and Combat Vehicle 90. The Swedish Navy originally planned to fit AMOS to the CB90 assault craft, but found that it was too small to carry it. Instead, a project to develop the larger Combat Boat 2010 was launched specifically to carry AMOS. Sweden cancelled its acquisition of the AMOS in 2009 due to budget regulations by recommendations from Genomförandegruppen. In 2016 a new self propelled mortar system called &quot;Mjölner&quot; based on a CV90 hull was ordered by the Swedish armed forces, it is based on the AMOS and has many visual similarities but is not as advanced.

== Design ==
When fitted to a vehicle, both GPS- and inertia positioning are used. The electronic fire-control system utilizes digital maps. The twin barreled AMOS is able to keep up rate of fire of 12 rounds per minute. Using its computer-controlled Multiple round simultaneous impact (MRSI) feature it is possible to set up a burst of up to 10 rounds that hit the target simultaneously. The first rounds are fired at higher angles with more propellant so that the rounds fly in a high arc. The next rounds are shot later with a slightly smaller angle and less propellant so that they fly a lower arc to the same target. This can be done seven times in a row, always adjusting the angle and power. The adjustment between shots is done by a computer. The strike of one AMOS unit roughly equals one strike of an artillery battery.

An AMOS turret has a full 360-degree field of fire at elevations of −3 to +85 degrees. AMOS is capable of both conventional indirect fire and direct fire for self-protection. In a typical installation, mounted on a Patria AMV or a similar vehicle, the vehicle can dash to the next position roughly 30 seconds after initiating the 14-round salvo, leaving minimal time for detection and counter-attack by enemy; evasion is the primary means of self-protection.

AMOS is manufactured and marketed by Finnish/Swedish Patria Hägglunds, a joint venture between Finnish Patria and Swedish BAE Systems Hägglunds. The system was to be known as the SSG120 in Swedish service. Ammunition for AMOS includes the Strix guided round and a modification of the Spanish Instalaza MAT-120 120 mm Mortar Cargo Round (although the latter is restricted from the Finnish inventory because of Finnish partnership in the Ottawa Treaty abolishing landmines). AMOS is capable of firing standard muzzle-loaded mortar rounds, but due to the breech-load design in the AMOS, the rounds have to be equipped with a short stub case at the base of the fins, similar to a sabot. When the round is fired, the case exits the breech system automatically.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
** 18 AMOS ordered in 2010, delivered from 2013, all in service 

=== Potential orders ===
** The Army is looking for 62 self-propelled mortars, capable of indirect, semi-direct and direct fire and most likely on the 8x8 Pandur II. The competitors are the Patria NEMO and the M120 Rak. The NEMO is the favorite. 

=== Cancelled orders ===
** 6 AMOS were in the end not ordered as 24 were initially ordered, but only 18 were purchased and supplied.
** 40 AMOS was cancelled in 2009 due to financial reasons. It was expected to be installed on the CV90. In 2016, the Mjölner was selected to take over the role of the AMOS. 80 Mjölner turrets have been ordered so far.
** The AMOS purchase was cancelled in 2009 after studies finding out that fitting it to the Combat Boat 2010 was too expensive. Initially, the CB90 was the platform planned, but it was discovered to be too small to carry the AMOS. In 2023, Sweden decided to manufacture such a ship, but with the Patria Nemo as a turret, 8 were ordered.

<doc id="569014" wikidata="Q237207" url="?curid=569014" title="Kathleen Kennedy (producer)">
<text>Kathleen Kennedy (born June 5, 1953) is an American film producer who has been president of Lucasfilm since 2012.

In 1981, Kennedy co-founded the production company Amblin Entertainment with Steven Spielberg and her eventual husband Frank Marshall. Her first film as a producer was &quot;E.T.&quot; (1982). A decade later, again with Spielberg, she produced the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; franchise, the first two of which became two of the top ten highest-grossing films of the 1990s. In 1992, she and Marshall founded The Kennedy/Marshall Company. In 2012, Kennedy became the president of Lucasfilm after The Walt Disney Company acquired the company.

As Lucasfilm&#x27;s president, Kennedy has overseen the development, production, and release of projects such as the &quot;Star Wars&quot; sequel trilogy (2015–2019), the &quot;Star Wars&quot; standalone films &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2018) as well as the fifth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, &quot;The Dial of Destiny&quot; (2023). She has also produced various &quot;Star Wars&quot; series including six live-action series for Disney+, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; (2019–present), &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2021), &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; (2022), &quot;Andor&quot; (2022–present), &quot;Ahsoka&quot; (2023–present), and &quot;The Acolyte&quot; (2024).

Kennedy has produced films which have earned over $11 billion worldwide, including five of the fifty highest-grossing movies in film history. As a producer, she has received eight Best Picture Academy Award nominations.

==Early life and education ==
Kathleen Kennedy was born on June 5, 1953, in Berkeley, California, to Donald R. Kennedy, a judge and attorney, and his wife Dione Marie &quot;Dede&quot; (née Dousseau), a one-time theater actress. She has two sisters. Her twin sister, Connie, formerly a location manager in British Columbia, Canada, is now the executive producer of the Virtual Production company Profile Studios. Her other sister is Dana Middleton-Silberstein, a television host and anchor, and press secretary/communications director for former Governor Gary Locke (D-WA).

Kennedy graduated from Shasta High School in Redding, California, in 1971. She continued her education at San Diego State University where she majored in telecommunications and film. In her final year, Kennedy gained employment at a local San Diego TV station, KCST (now KNSD), taking on various roles including camera operator, video editor, floor director and finally as KCST news production coordinator.

== Career == 
=== 1978–2011 ===
After her employment with KCST, she produced a local talk show entitled &quot;You&#x27;re On&quot; for the station for four years before moving to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, Kennedy secured her first film production job working as an assistant to John Milius, who at the time was executive producer of Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;1941&quot; (1979).

While working under Milius during the production of &quot;1941&quot;, Kennedy caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, who stated in 2015:She was horrible at taking notes... but what she did know how to do was interrupt somebody in midsentence. We&#x27;d be pitching ideas back and forth, and Kathy—who was supposed to be writing these ideas down—suddenly put her pencil down and would say something like, &quot;And what if he didn&#x27;t get the girl, but instead he got the dog?&quot;Spielberg asked Kennedy to become his secretary for her organization abilities, and Kennedy gradually took on larger roles in the moviemaking process. Kennedy was credited as associate to Spielberg on &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), then associate producer on Spielberg&#x27;s production of Tobe Hooper&#x27;s &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982).
Kennedy began receiving producer credit with Spielberg on the major box-office hit &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), and continued serving the role on most of his films for the next three decades. In 1982, she helped and run the production company Amblin Entertainment with Spielberg and her future husband Frank Marshall. She also produced &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984) with George Lucas and Marshall, and appeared in the film&#x27;s opening sequence as a dancer. Following her work on the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films, she rose to become one of Hollywood&#x27;s leading producers. With Amblin, she produced the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, collaborating with such directors as Martin Scorsese, Robert Zemeckis, Barry Levinson, and Clint Eastwood. In 1991, she and Marshall formed The Kennedy/Marshall Company with a deal at DreamWorks. She continued her business relationship with Spielberg and became producer for &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993) and executive producer for the historical drama &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (also 1993). Non-Spielberg films that she produced during this time include &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; (1995), &quot;Twister&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999).

Kennedy was a producer on Spielberg&#x27;s films: &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Munich&quot; (both 2005), the latter of which earned her an Academy Award nomination. Marshall and Kennedy were producers for the US versions of two Studio Ghibli animated features &quot;Ponyo&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot; (2012). She also produced Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), which was nominated for seven Golden Globes and twelve Academy Awards.

In May 2012, she stepped down from Kennedy/Marshall, leaving Marshall as sole principal of their film company. In the following month, Kennedy became co-chair of Lucasfilm Ltd. alongside George Lucas. On October 30, 2012, when Lucas sold his company to Disney, Kennedy was promoted to president. In 2018 and again in 2021, Kennedy&#x27;s contract to remain president of Lucasfilm was extended another three years, first through October 30, 2021 and then to 2024.

<doc id="569017" wikidata="Q5631339" url="?curid=569017" title="HMS Andromeda (F57)">
<text>HMS &quot;Andromeda was a of the [[Royal Navy]]. She was built at [[HMNB Portsmouth|HM Dockyard Portsmouth]]. She was launched on 24 May 1967 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 2 December 1968. She took part in the [[Falklands War]]. She was sold to India in 1995, for use as a training ship, being renamedINS &quot;Krishna. She was finally decommissioned in May 2012.

==Construction==
&quot;Andromeda&quot; was one of three &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates ordered on 12 January 1965, the other two being and . She was laid down at HMNB Portsmouth on 25 May 1966, launched on 24 May 1967 and commissioned on 2 December 1968 with the Pennant number &quot;F57&quot;.
&quot;Andromeda&quot; was a Batch 3, &quot;Broad-Beamed&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;, and as such was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. A single Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher was fitted aft (on the Helicopter hangar roof), while two Oerlikon 20mm cannon provided close-in defence. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Andromeda&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 184 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, together with a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS).

Between 1977 and 1980, &quot;Andromeda&quot; underwent a major reconstruction, in which the ship&#x27;s armament and sensors were greatly revised. The 4.5 inch gun turret, Sea Cat launcher and Limbo anti submarine mortar were removed, with a sextuple Sea Wolf surface-to-air missile launcher and four Exocet missiles fitted forward. Two triple STWS-1 torpedo tubes allowed anti-submarine torpedoes to be launched, while the ship&#x27;s hangar and flight deck was enlarged to allow a Westland Lynx helicopter to be carried instead of the smaller Wasp. A completely new radar outfit was fitted, with a Type 967 air-search radar and a Type 968 low-level air warning and surface search radar fitted back to back on the ship&#x27;s foremast, and with a Type 1006 navigation radar fitted lower down on the ship&#x27;s foremast. A Type 2016 long-range search sonar replaced the Type 184 sonar, while the Type 162 bottom search sonar was retained. Displacement increased to standard and full load, while speed dropped to .

==Royal Navy Service==

===Beira Patrol===
In 1969, &quot;Andromeda&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf and Far East as leader of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, taking part in the Beira Patrol, a deployment that was used to prevent oil reaching Rhodesia via Mozambique. On 1 June 1970, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker , on her way to refuel &quot;Andromeda&quot;, struck an uncharted pinnacle of rock off the Seychelles, and sank. &quot;Andromeda&quot; was the first ship on the scene of the accident, and helped to rescue the crew of &quot;Ennerdale&quot;, the wreck of which was later destroyed by explosives. Later that year, &quot;Andromeda&quot; returned to European waters. On 23 October 1970, the Liberian-flagged tanker collided with the tanker off the Isle of Wight and caught fire with 13 killed aboard &quot;Pacific Glory&quot;. The blazing &quot;Pacific Glory&quot; ran aground on 24 October, and &quot;Andromeda&quot; took part in the large scale clean up operation. On 9 October 1970, &quot;Andromeda&quot; and her helicopter went to the aid of the tug RMAS &quot;Samsonia&quot; which had suffered a mechanical breakdown when towing the landing ship in bad weather through the Pentland Firth. In 1971 she was present at Portsmouth Navy Days. In August 1971 she joined the 6th Frigate Squadron as leader.

===Cod Wars===

In 1973, &quot;Andromeda&quot; took part in the Second Cod War, patrolling to intervene in case of interference on British fishing by Icelandic vessels. On 11 August 1973, &quot;Andromeda&quot; was rammed by the Icelandic gunboat . The following year, &quot;Andromeda&quot; had to evacuate British civilians from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus after Turkey had invaded it. In 1975, during the Third Cod War, the Icelandic gunboat rammed &quot;Andromeda&quot; on 28 December, damaging her guardrail and a chaff launcher. On 7 January 1976, &quot;Andromeda&quot; was involved in another ramming, this time with the gunboat &quot;Þór&quot;. Both warships were damaged, with &quot;Andromeda&quot; receiving a dent as a result of this collision, and had to return to Devonport for repairs.

===Falklands War===

In 1977, &quot;Andromeda&quot; took part in the Fleet Review of the Royal Navy, during the Silver Jubilee celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II. Between November 1977 and December 1980, &quot;Andromeda&quot; underwent modernisation, including the addition of Exocet and Sea Wolf missiles at Devonport dockyard. &quot;Andromeda&quot; took part in the Falklands War in 1982, returning to the United Kingdom from a deployment in the Western Atlantic in April 1982, before sailing for the South Atlantic as part of the &#x27;Bristol Group&#x27;, entering the Total Exclusion Zone on 25 May. She mainly acted as a close-escort for the aircraft carrier , receiving no damage during the war. After visiting South Georgia in August, she sailed for home, reaching Devonport on 10 September.

===Varied duties===
In the subsequent years of the 1980s, &quot;Andromeda&quot; performed a number of varied duties, patrolling the Persian Gulf on Armilla Patrol, and deployments to the Falklands and West Indies. In late summer of 1984, &quot;Andromeda&quot; docked at Baltimore Harbor in the US for 10 days, on her way from the Falklands back home to England.
Armilla deployment 1983. Ports visited included Djibouti, Cochin, Singapore, Mombasa, Mauritius, Reunion and the Maldives
Falklands 1984
Armilla deployment 1985. Ports visited included Muscat, Abu Dhabi, Mombasa and Gibraltar.

==Sale==
Between 1990 and 1991, &quot;Andromeda&quot; underwent a refit. She was decommissioned two-years later. &quot;Andromeda&quot; was sold to the Indian Navy in 1995, where she was commissioned as the training ship, INS &quot;Krishna&quot;. Her armament had been reduced to two Bofors 40 mm guns and two Oerlikon 20 mm cannons.

==Fate==
&quot;Krishna&quot; was decommissioned on 24 May 2012 at Mumbai, 44 years to the day after her launch. The ship was sunk in the Bay of Bengal for target practice by Indian Navy ships.

<doc id="569018" wikidata="Q452067" url="?curid=569018" title="Nicole Powell">
<text>Nicole Kristen Powell (born June 22, 1982) is an American basketball coach who was the head women&#x27;s basketball coach at University of California, Riverside. As a player, she had a standout collegiate career at Stanford University, Powell had an 11-year WNBA career most notably with the Sacramento Monarchs where she was an All-Star and won a WNBA Championship. Powell also played professionally overseas for Fenerbahçe Istanbul. Powell had previously served on the coaching staffs at Gonzaga, Oregon, and Grand Canyon before being named the head coach of UC Riverside in March 2020.

==Early life==
Born in Sierra Vista, Arizona, Powell played for Mountain Pointe High School in Phoenix, where she was named a WBCA All-American. She also was named a 2000 Parade Magazine First Team All-American in 2000 and the Arizona Player of the Century by the Arizona Republic. She participated in the 2000 WBCA High School All-America Game where she scored fourteen points.

In addition, Powell during her high school years earned all-region selection in both tennis and track, won the state badminton singles championships in 1997, 1999 and 2000, won the state discus title in 2000, and was an Arizona 5A doubles runner-up in tennis in 2000.

==College==
Powell played the forward position for Stanford University women&#x27;s NCAA basketball team. During her tenure there, she broke many school records, was named an All-American three times, and won numerous awards. She majored in urban studies.

She was the first women&#x27;s basketball player in the history of what is now the Pac-12 Conference to have achieved multiple triple-double games (that is, 10 totals or more in three different positive statistical categories) during the same season. Powell has since been joined by two other players: Brittany Boyd of California, who recorded two triple-doubles in the 2014–15 season, and Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon, who had multiple triple-doubles in all four of her college seasons (four in 2016–17, six in 2017–18, and eight in both 2018–19 and 2019–20). Powell and Ionescu are also the only NCAA Division I women&#x27;s players to have recorded multiple triple-doubles in the NCAA tournament; Powell had two consecutive triple-doubles in 2002, while Ionescu had one each in 2018 and 2019.

==Coaching==
Powell spent one season, 2013–14, at Gonzaga as an assistant coach for coach Kelly Graves. After Graves accepted the head coaching position for the University of Oregon, Powell took the assistant coach position at Oregon for three years. The 2016–2017 season was the most successful under Powell&#x27;s assistant coaching career; it included a top-five recruiting class in 2016, headlined by Ionescu; a run to the Elite 8 in the 2017 NCAA Tournament; winning 6 out of 23 games against Top 25 opponents; and finishing the season at #16.

In April 2017, Powell accepted the head coaching position at Grand Canyon University.

==WNBA career==
Powell was picked No. 3 overall by the Charlotte Sting in the 2004 WNBA draft. She was used by the Sting as a utility player, appearing in 31 games.

On March 3, 2005, she was traded to the Sacramento Monarchs in a multi-player deal. The trade greatly aided the Monarchs in the 2005 season while Powell enjoyed a breakout year and eventually was named the recipient of that year&#x27;s WNBA&#x27;s Most Improved Player award. She played a pivotal role in the Monarchs&#x27; 2005 WNBA Finals victory over the Connecticut Sun.

Although the Monarchs struggled in subsequent years, Powell&#x27;s statistics continued to improve. In 2009, with several of her teammates hobbled by injuries, Powell averaged 16.7 points per game and was the best free throw shooter in the WNBA with 97.9% of attempts made. She also participated in the 2009 WNBA All-Star Game, where she scored 21 points off the bench.

The Monarchs ceased operations following their 2009 season. The New York Liberty selected Nicole Powell with the first pick in the ensuing dispersal draft. She was traded to the Tulsa Shock before the 2013 season and signed with the Seattle Storm before the 2014 season.

<text> () is one of the three main pillars of the teachings of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikhism. The other two pillars are &quot;Naam Japo&quot; and &quot;Kirat Karo&quot;. It means to share what you have and to consume it together as a community. This could be wealth, food. etc. The term is also used to mean to share ones wealth with others in the community, to give to charity, to distribute in &quot;Langar&quot; and to generally help others in the community who need help. A Sikh is expected to contribute a portion of their wealth or income to people in need or to a worthy cause.

An alternative spelling and meaning, &quot;Vand Ke Chakna&quot;, means to share the fruits of one’s labor with others before considering oneself, thus living as an inspiration and a support to the entire community.

<text>Gaziantep Province () is a province and metropolitan municipality in south-central Turkey. It is located in the westernmost part of Turkey&#x27;s Southeastern Anatolia Region and partially in the Mediterranean Region. Its area is 6,803 km2, and its population is 2,154,051 (2022). Its capital is the city of Gaziantep. It neighbours Adıyaman to the northeast, Şanlıurfa to the east, Syria and Kilis to the south, Hatay to the southwest, Osmaniye to the west and Kahramanmaraş to the northwest.

An important trading center since ancient times, the province is also one of Turkey&#x27;s major manufacturing zones, and its agriculture is dominated by the cultivation of pistachio nuts.

In ancient times, first under the power of Yamhad, then the Hittites and later the Assyrians controlled the region. It saw much fighting during the Crusades, and Saladin won a key battle there in 1183. After World War I and the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s disintegration, it was invaded by the forces of the French Third Republic during the Turkish War of Independence. It was returned to Turkish control after the Treaty of Lausanne was signed, formally ending hostilities between Turkey and the Allies of World War I.

Originally known as Antep, the title &quot;gazi&quot; (meaning &quot;veteran&quot; in Turkish) was added to the province&#x27;s and the provincial capital&#x27;s name in 1921, due to its population&#x27;s actions during the Turkish War of Independence.

Kilis Province was part of Gaziantep Province until it separated in 1994. Turks are the majority in the province.

== Geography ==
Gaziantep is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.
=== Geology ===
Two major active geological faults meet in western Gaziantep near the border with adjoining Osmaniye Province: the Dead Sea Transform and the East Anatolian Fault. These represent the tectonic boundary between the northward-moving Arabian Plate to the east, and the converging African and Eurasian Plates to the west.

On February 6, 2023, at 04:17 TRT (01:17 UTC), a  7.8 earthquake occurred in Gaziantep Province on the East Anatolian Fault, which caused widespread damage and loss of life. The epicenter was west-northwest of the city of Gaziantep. At 13:24, it was followed by a 7.7 earthquake.

==Demographics==


==Districts==

There are nine districts as listed below:

The city of Gaziantep encompasses Şahinbey and Şehitkamil districts; İslahiye and Nurdağı districts form the western part of the province, while the remaining districts lie to the east of Gaziantep city.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-91 (NATO reporting name Boot) was a two-seat Soviet attack aircraft built during the 1950s. It was initially designed as a carrier-borne aircraft, but was converted into a land-based aircraft after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 cancelled the aircraft carriers being designed. Two prototypes had been built and production had been approved by the Soviet Navy when it was inspected by the General Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, in 1956. He remarked how ridiculous the Tu-91 looked and the program was cancelled.

==Development==
Following the end of World War II in 1945, Stalin ordered an aggressive naval expansion to counter the American naval superiority. The expansion called for building a large number of warships oriented around battleships and other heavy ships, with aircraft carriers limited to a supporting role, despite Admiral of the Fleet Nikolai Kuznetsov, Commander-in-chief of the Soviet Navy, pushing for carriers. Stalin restored him to command of the navy in 1951, after having demoted him four years before, and Kuznetsov attempted to persuade him of the value of the carrier in 1952, but Stalin refused to make a decision before his death the following year.

Kuznetsov had ordered preliminary design work to begin on the Project 85 light aircraft carrier and the aircraft for the ship before Stalin&#x27;s death, although the ship was never more than a paper design. This allowed the Tupolev Design bureau to decide upon on a single-engined turboprop aircraft to meet Soviet Naval Aviation&#x27;s requirement for a long-range strike aircraft, capable of attacking targets with bombs or torpedoes. The new leaders of the Soviet Union rejected proposals for carriers and the Council of Ministers issued a requirement for a land-based bomber powered by a Kuznetsov TV-2 turboprop engine that was capable of level and dive bombing attacks on targets with bombs, torpedoes, rockets, gunfire and naval mines, in addition to coastal reconnaissance missions, on 29 April 1953. This forced the bureau to revise the design to eliminate the wing-folding mechanism, arresting gear and other carrier-specific equipment for the second prototype.

The Tu-91 first flew on 17 May 1955, when the manufacturer&#x27;s flight testing began. They concluded successfully about September with the test pilots concluding that the aircraft was highly manoeuverable, although barrel rolls should be forbidden. The aircraft also passed the subsequent state testing and the design bureau began preparing for production at Factory No. 31, in Tbilisi, Georgia. 
The Tu-91 was part of a display of the latest military aircraft for the Soviet leadership in mid-1956, one of the very few propeller-driven aircraft present. When
the newly elected Khrushchev inquired about the aircraft, the officer detailed to the aircraft misspoke, stating that it could do the job of a heavy cruiser rather than it had the firepower of that ship. Khrushchev replied, &quot;But nobody needs heavy cruisers any more&quot;, and commented how ridiculous it looked. This off-hand comment caused the program to be cancelled.

==Description==
The Tu-91 was a duralumin low-winged monoplane with dihedral wings built from three spars. The wing consisted of three sections, two outer panels and the center section that housed four fuel tanks and the tricycle landing gear. Control surfaces on the outer panels consisted of manually tabbed ailerons and slotted flaps. The aircraft had a conventional tail structure with vertical and horizontal stabilisers. The engine was mounted mid-fuselage above the wing spars, driving a six-bladed contra-rotating propeller in the nose via a long shaft that passed through the cockpit. Providing sufficient air to the engine required a lot of development time that eventually included replacing an engine on a Tupolev Tu-4LL flying testbed with a mockup of the Tu-91&#x27;s nose with a working TV-2 installation. The solution adopted consisted of three air intakes: a chin inlet and two cheek inlets below the cockpit that met in a plenum chamber forward of the engine. The engine exhausted through a bifurcated exhaust duct that exited the sides of the fuselage aft of the wing.

The crew of two sat side by side in a cockpit in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, enclosed in an armour &quot;bathtub&quot; that consisted of ANBA-1 light alloy armour. All of the panels in the two canopies were bulletproof except for those directly overhead. In addition to the forward fuel tanks, there were another pair of tanks located between the exhaust ducts, all of which self sealing and filled with inert gases. The internal armament of the Tu-91 consisted of a pair of NR-23 cannon located in the wing roots and another pair of NR-23s in a DK-15 powered tail turret that were remotely controlled by the aircraft&#x27;s navigator using a periscopic gunsight mounted externally above the cockpit. The aircraft could be fitted with five plyons, one under the fuselage and the others under the wings. These could carry a single torpedo or various bombs, rockets and mines up to a total weight of . Two of the wing pylons were plumbed to carry drop tanks in addition to weapons. A camera was fitted in the rear fuselage for reconnaissance missions.

<doc id="569036" wikidata="Q995376" url="?curid=569036" title="Fabada asturiana">
<text>Fabada asturiana, often simply known as fabada, is a rich Asturian bean stew, originally from and most commonly found in the autonomous community of Principality of Asturias, but widely available throughout the whole of Spain and in Spanish restaurants worldwide. Canned fabada is sold in most supermarkets across the country.

Fabada is a hot and heavy dish, and for that reason, it is most commonly eaten during the winter and as the largest meal of the day, lunch. It is usually served as a starter but may also be the main course of the meal. It is typically served with Asturian cider or a red wine.

==Ingredients==
Fabada is made with &quot;fabes de la Granja&quot; (a kind of large white beans from Spain) soaked overnight before use; &quot;lacón&quot; (shoulder of pork); pancetta or bacon (&quot;tocino&quot;), &quot;morcilla&quot; (a kind of blood sausage from Spain); chorizo, olive oil, sweet paprika, garlic and salt. 

==History==
The consumption of &quot;fabes&quot; goes back in Asturias to the 16th century, in which it is known with certainty that they were planted in the territory and consumed. The variety used in fabada is called &quot;de la Granja&quot;; it is a smooth and buttery variety appropriate for this dish. The cultivation of this variety occupies about 2,500 hectares in Asturias. The ingredients of the fabada recipe reveal a humble origin. Scholars think it may have been born in the 18th century, although there is no evidence to support this. Despite the fact that fabas are a purely rural ingredient, the belief that fabada is born in the cities is maintained. There are no written literary references to fabas in any of the works of the time. One of the best known, La Regenta, does not mention it despite making an exhaustive description of the customs of the region. Other authors mention its resemblance to the Languedoc cassoulet from French cuisine that could have reached Spain thanks to the Camino de Santiago via the French route in the Middle Ages.

The first written reference to fabada appears in the Asturian newspaper of Gijón El Comercio in 1884 but does not mention the recipe. Later appearances in Asturian culinary literature relate the dish to the Asturian pot, authors such as Armando Palacio Valdés when describing the characteristics of Asturian shepherds in his work &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; (1931) does not mention the dish. According to the research of different experts, fabada is born in an undetermined period between the 19th and 20th centuries. Some authors lean more towards the twentieth century, but today it is already a well-known dish, not only in Asturias but throughout the Spanish territory. Recipes appear in the literature of the beginning of the century.

Asturian emigrants around the world noticed this dish in other places, in this way there are variants of this dish in some places, such as in the areas near the American city of Tampa.

In Colombia, the paisa tray is a Creole adaptation of the fabada, replacing the fabas with red ball beans (soaked for 16 hours) cooked with pork leg, garlic onion and salt, accompanied by chorizo, pork rinds, cooked ground meat, fried egg, sliced avocado and white rice.

==Variations==
Outside Asturias, the Spanish olla podrida, southern French cassoulet and Portuguese and Brazilian feijoada are similar to fabada asturiana.

<text>Gaziantep, historically Aintab and still informally called Antep, is a major city in south-central Turkey. It is the capital of the Gaziantep Province, in the westernmost part of Turkey&#x27;s Southeastern Anatolia Region and partially in the Mediterranean Region. It is located approximately east of Adana and north of Aleppo, Syria and situated on the Sajur River. The city is thought to be located on the site of ancient Antiochia ad Taurum and is near ancient Zeugma.

As of the 2021 census, the Gaziantep province (Metropolitan municipality) was home to 2,130,432 inhabitants, of whom 1,775,904 lived in the metropolitan area made of two (out of three) urban districts of Şahinbey and Şehitkamil, as Oğuzeli is not conurbated. It is the sixth-most populous city in Turkey. Gaziantep is a diverse city inhabited mostly by ethnic Turks and a significant minority of Kurds and Syrian refugees. It was historically populated by Turkmens, Armenians, Jews, and a plethora of other ethnic groups.

In February 2023, the city was heavily damaged by the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.

==Name==
Due to the city&#x27;s contact with various ethnic groups and cultures throughout its history, the name of the city has many variants and alternatives, such as:
*&quot;Hantab&quot;, &quot;Hamtab&quot;, or &quot;Hatab&quot; as known by the Crusaders,
*&quot;Antab&quot; and its variants in vulgar Turkish and Armenian since 17th century the latest,
*&quot;Aīntāb&quot; () in Ottoman Turkish,
*&quot;Gazi Ayıntap&quot; in official Turkish after February 1921, when the Turkish parliament honored the city as &quot;Ghazi Aīntāb&quot; to commemorate its resistance to the French Siege of Aintab during the Franco-Turkish War,
*&quot;Gaziantep&quot; in official Turkish after 1928,
*&quot;&#x27;Aīntāb&quot; () in Arabic,
*&quot;Êntab&quot; or &quot;Dîlok&quot; in Kurdish,
*&quot;Aïntab&quot; or &quot;Verdun Turc&quot; in French.

The several theories for the origin of the current name include: 
* &quot;Aïntap&quot; may be derived from &quot;khantap&quot;, meaning &quot;king&#x27;s land&quot; in the Hittite language.
* &quot;Aïn&quot;, an Arabic and Aramaic word meaning &quot;spring&quot;, and &quot;tab&quot; as a word of praise.
* &quot;Antep&quot; could be a corruption of the Arabic &quot;&#x27;aīn ṭayyib&quot; meaning &quot;good spring&quot;. However, the Arabic name for the city is spelled with t (), not ṭ ().
* &quot;Ayin dab&quot; or &quot;Ayin debo&quot; in Aramaic, meaning &quot;spring of the wolf&quot;

==History==


===Hellenistic period===
Gaziantep is the probable site of the Hellenistic city of Antiochia ad Taurum (&quot;Antiochia in the Taurus Mountains&quot;).

===Medieval history===
During its early history, Aintab was largely a fortress overshadowed by the city of Dülük, some 12 km to the north. Aintab came to prominence after an earthquake in the 14th century devastated Dülük. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, the region passed to the Umayyads in 661 AD and the Abbasids in 750. It was ravaged several times during the Arab–Byzantine wars. After the disintegration of the Abbasid dynasty, the city was ruled successively by the Tulunids, the Ikhshidids, and the Hamdanids. In 962, it was recaptured by the Byzantines, upon the expansion led by Nikephoros II Phokas.

After Afshin Bey captured the fortress in 1067, Aintab fell to Seljuk rule and was administered by Seljuk emirs of Damascus. One of these emirs, Tutush I appointed Armenian noble Thoros of Edessa as the governor of the region.

It was captured by the Crusaders and united to the Maras Seigneurship in the County of Edessa in 1098. The region continued to be ruled by independent or vassalized Armenian lords, such as Kogh Vasil. It reverted to the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1150, was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206 and captured by the Zengids in 1172 and the Ayyubids in 1181. It was retaken by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm in 1218.

With the turn of the 13th-century, Dülük became one of Aintab&#x27;s dependencies according to geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi. In the next century, Aintab was the capital of its district and a town with fine markets much frequented by merchants and travellers, while Dülük was in ruins, according to Abulfeda. Still, Aintab continued to be hotly contested throughout these centuries. It was besieged by the Mongols in 1270.

It repeatedly changed hands between the Ilkhanate and the Mamluk Sultanate or the Dulkadirids, a Turkoman vassal state of the Mamluks. Gaziantep was near the southern frontier of the Dulkadir emirate, and on several occasions it slipped out of their control. The Ilkhans ruled over it between 1260 and 1261, 1271–1272, 1280–1281 and 1299–1317. The Mamluks controlled the city between 1261 and 1271, 1272–1280, 1281–1299, 1317–1341, 1353–1378, 1381–1389. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the Dulkadir leader Sevli Beg in 1390. Although the Mamluks and their Dulkadirid vassals could control 
the city from 1395 until the Ottoman conquest in 1516, the city was besieged by Timur in 1400, and then in 1420 by the Ak Koyunlu leader Kara Yusuf.

These attacks all caused destruction and suffering among the local population. But at the same time, the city was &quot;acquiring a reputation as a cultured urban center&quot;. Badr al-Din al-Ayni, an Aintab native who became a successful diplomat, judge, and historian under the Mamluks, wrote at the end of the 1300s that the city was called &quot;little Bukhara&quot; because so many scholars came to study there. Ayni also left a firsthand account of the suffering caused during Sevli Beg&#x27;s siege in 1390.

Another rough patch for Aintab&#x27;s people came in the late 1460s, when the Dulkadir prince Şehsuvar rebelled against the Mamluks. Mamluk forces captured Aintab in May 1468, driving out Şehsuvar&#x27;s forces; a report by the governor of Aleppo indicates that resistance had been fierce. Just a month later, Şehsuvar recaptured Aintab after four &quot;engagements&quot; with Mamluk forces. After Şehsuvar&#x27;s final defeat and public execution by the Mamluks in 1473, Gaziantep enjoyed a period of relative peace and stability under his brother and successor Alaüddevle. Alaüddevle appears to have considered Gaziantep an important possession and commissioned several constructions in the city, including a reservoir and a large mosque in the middle of town. The city&#x27;s fortress was also renovated, completed in 1481. These repairs were likely ordered by the Mamluk sultan Qaitbay during his tour of northern Syria in 1477; his name is inscribed above the entrance portal, perhaps symbolically marking his territory.

The end of the Dulkadir principality came around 1515. Alaüddevle refused to fight alongside the Ottomans at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. The Ottomans used this as a pretext to overthrow him, and in June 1515 he was executed. As Alaüddevle had been a Mamluk vassal, the Mamluks considered this an affront, and the Mamluk sultan Qansuh al-Ghawri mobilized an army and marched north towards Aleppo.

The conflict over the region meant that in Gaziantep, anxieties about the fate of the city and its surroundings must have been high. Later court records from the early 1540s provide documentary evidence of &quot;dislocation and loss of population&quot; as people fled; this may have been more pronounced in rural areas than in the city itself.

===Ottoman period===
The Ottoman Empire captured Gaziantep just before the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, under the reign of Sultan Selim I. In the Ottoman period, Aintab was a &quot;sanjak &quot;centred initially in the Dulkadir Eyalet (1516–1818), and later in the Aleppo vilayet (1908–1918). It was also a &quot;kaza&quot; in the Aleppo vilayet (1818–1908). The city established itself as a centre for commerce due to its location straddling trade routes.

Although it was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia only between 1155–1157 and 1204–1206, for most of the last two millennia, Gaziantep hosted a large Armenian community. Armenians played a significant role in the city&#x27;s history, culture, welfare, and prosperity. These communities no longer exist in the city due to the Hamidian massacres in 1895 and the Armenian genocide in 1915.
Gaziantep served a significant trade route within the Ottoman Empire. Armenians were active in manufacturing, agriculture production and, most notably, trade, and became the wealthiest ethnic group in the city, until their wealth was confiscated during the Armenian genocide.

====Battle of Marj Dabiq====
At the beginning of his campaign against the Mamluks in 1516, the Ottoman sultan Selim I brought his army to Gaziantep en route to Syria. The city&#x27;s Mamluk governor, Yunus Beg, submitted to Selim without a fight and gave him the keys to the castle on 20 August. The next day, 21 August, Selim set up camp outside the city &quot;with great majesty and pomp&quot; and held meetings with local military commanders to discuss strategy for the upcoming battle. The fateful Battle of Marj Dabiq took place just days later, on 24 August. Gaziantep, although not an active battle site, thus played a strategic role in the Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk sultanate.

The Ottoman victory at Marj Dabiq had profound consequences for Gaziantep, although its inhabitants had no way of knowing at the time. For the first time in almost 1,000 years, Gaziantep was located in the middle of an empire rather than a contested border region. It lost its strategic importance, but also its vulnerability to attack. For four centuries, until the French occupation in 1921, Gaziantep was relatively peaceful.

====Economic recovery====
In the short term, though, Gaziantep was still reeling from the instability before (and after) the Ottoman conquest. During that period, Gaziantep had suffered from &quot;depredation&quot;, as well as fear caused by political uncertainty. Besides political conflict, the city&#x27;s economic slump at this time can also be partly attributed to a general decline in commerce in the eastern Mediterranean region that caused a general economic downturn in the region in the early 1500s.

Only around the 1530s, when the Ottoman authorities turned their attention to the territories recently conquered from Dulkadir, do cadastral records indicate renewed prosperity in Gaziantep. An important event was Süleyman the Magnificent&#x27;s successful Mesopotamian campaign against Safavid Iran in 1534-36, which took Baghdad and increased the security of trade routes in Gaziantep&#x27;s region. As with the earlier economic downturn, the renewed prosperity in Gaziantep in the 1530s was part of a broader regional pattern of economic growth during this period.

As a disclaimer – some of this apparent economic growth may be an artifact of using tax documents as a source. Tax assessors may have simply been doing more accurate counts in later surveys, or the government might have been applying more strict scrutiny as their control increased. Part of this was deliberate – the Ottomans had a policy of lowering taxes in recently conquered territories, both to placate locals and to provide an economic stimulus to help war-torn areas recover. Later, as their control solidified, the authorities would raise taxes again. According to Leslie Peirce, this seems to have been the case in Gaziantep – tax rates in 1536 were significantly lower than the rates in 1520, which she assumes were the pre-Ottoman rates. The rates went up again in the 1543 survey, which she interprets as the Ottomans raising taxes again in the meantime.

====Administrative changes====
The Dulkadir emirate did not simply go away immediately after the Ottoman victory at Marj Dabiq. It stuck around as an Ottoman vassal until 1522, when the last Dulkadir ruler &quot;resisted discipline by the Ottoman administration&quot;. The Ottomans had him executed and officially dismantled the Dulkadir principality, annexing its territories to the empire to form the &quot;beglerbeglik&quot; of Dulkadir.

Despite being part of the former Dulkadir territories, though, the &quot;sanjak&quot; of Gaziantep was initially put under the &quot;beglerbeglik&quot; of Aleppo instead of Dulkadir. This indicates how, just as in the Mamluk period, Gaziantep was then seen more as part of northern Syria than as part of Anatolia. The area was &quot;culturally mixed&quot;, and many locals were bilingual in Turkish and Arabic (as well as other languages). Gaziantep&#x27;s cultural and economic ties were mostly with Aleppo, which was a major international center of trade.

At some point in the 1530s, Gaziantep was moved into the &quot;beglerbeglik&quot; of Dulkadir, whose capital was Maraş. Even though it was now administratively part of Dulkadir, Gaziantep remained commercially more connected to Aleppo.

====17th through 19th centuries====
The 17th-century Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi noted it had 3,900 shops and two &quot;bedesten&quot;s.

In 1818, Gaziantep was moved back into the Aleppo province.

By the end of the 19th century, Aintab had a population of about 45,000, two-thirds of whom were Muslim—largely Turkish, but also partially Arab. A large community of Christians lived in the Armenian community. In the 19th century, considerable American Protestant Christian missionary activity occurred in Aintab. In particular, Central Turkey College was founded in 1874 by the American Mission Board and largely served the Armenian community. The Armenians were systemically slaughtered during the Hamidian massacres in 1895 and later the Armenian genocide in 1915. Consequently, the Central Turkey College was transferred to Aleppo in 1916.
===Republic of Turkey===
After the First World War and Armistice of Mudros, Gaziantep was occupied by the United Kingdom on 17 December 1918, and it was transferred to France on 5 November 1919. The French Armenian Legion was also involved in occupation. In April 1920 irregular Turkish troops known as Kuva-yi Milliye besieged the city, but the 10-month-long battle resulted in French victory. Around 6,000 Turkish civilians were killed in the process.

The French made the last attempt to revive the Armenian community in the city during the Siege of Aintab, where the Armenians who fled the genocide were promised their homes back in their native lands. However, on 25 December 1921, the Treaty of Ankara was signed, and as a result, the French evacuated the city.

According to Ümit Kurt, born in modern-day Gaziantep and an academic at Harvard&#x27;s Center for Middle East Studies, &quot;The famous battle of Aintab against the French … seems to have been as much the organised struggle of a group of genocide profiteers seeking to hold onto their loot as it was a fight against an occupying force. The resistance … sought to make it impossible for the Armenian repatriates to remain in their native towns, terrorising them [again] to make them flee. In short, not only did the local … landowners, industrialists, and civil-military bureaucratic elites lead to the resistance movement, but they also financed it to cleanse Aintab of Armenians.&quot; The same Turkish families who made their wealth through the expropriation of Armenians in 1915 and 1921/1922 continued to dominate the city&#x27;s politics through the one-party period of the Republic of Turkey.

In 2013, Turkey, a member state of NATO, requested deployment of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Gaziantep to be able to respond faster in a case of military operation against Turkish soil in the Syrian Civil War, which was accepted.

On 6 February 2023, the city and nearby areas were devastated by catastrophic earthquakes. Around 900 buildings collapsed and 10,777 other buildings were heavily damaged in the city, which have been slated for demolition. Historic buildings including the Gaziantep Castle, the Şirvani Mosque and the Liberation Mosque were also heavily damaged.

== Geography ==
The city is located on the Aintab plateau.

=== Climate ===
Gaziantep has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cs&quot;), with very hot, dry summers and cool, wet and often snowy winters.

According to 1966 data, on average, Gaziantep experiences 4.6 snowy days per winter with 10 days of snow cover, along with 2.5 days of hail.

Highest recorded temperature: on 29 July 2000 and 14 August 2023&lt;br&gt;Lowest recorded temperature: on 15 January 1950

==Politics==
The current mayor of Gaziantep is Fatma Şahin, who had previously served as the minister of family and social policies in the third cabinet of Erdoğan.

==Economy==
Gaziantep is famous for its regional specialities: copperware and &quot;Yemeni&quot; sandals, specific to the region, are two examples. The city is an economic centre for Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The number of large industrial businesses established in Gaziantep comprise four percent of Turkish industry in general, while small industries comprise six percent. Also, Gaziantep has the largest organised industrial area in Turkey and holds first position in exports and imports. The city is the centre of the green olive oil-based Nizip Soap industry.

Traditionally, commerce in Gaziantep was centre in covered markets known as &#x27;Bedesten&#x27; or &#x27;Hans&#x27;, the best known of which are the Zincirli Bedesten, Hüseyin Pasha Bedesten and Kemikli Bedesten.

Gaziantep also has a developing tourist industry. Development around the base of the castle upgrades the beauty and accessibility to the castle and to the surrounding copper workshops. New restaurants and tourist-friendly businesses are moving into the area. In comparison with some other regions of Turkey, tourists are still a novelty in Gaziantep and the locals make them very welcome. Many students studying the English language are willing to be guides for tourists.

Gaziantep is one of the leading producers of machined carpets in the world. It exported approximately US$700 million of machine-made carpets in 2006. There are over 100 carpet facilities in the Gaziantep Organized Industrial Zone.

With its extensive olive groves, vineyards, and pistachio orchards, Gaziantep is one of the important agricultural and industrial centres of Turkey.

Gaziantep is the centre of pistachio cultivation in Turkey, producing in 2007, and lends its name to the Turkish word for pistachio, &quot;Antep fıstığı&quot;, meaning &quot;Antep nut&quot;.

Gaziantep is the main centre for pistachio processing in Turkey, with some 80% of the country&#x27;s pistachio processing (such as shelling, packaging, exporting, and storage) being done in the city. &quot;Antep fıstığı&quot; is a protected geographical indication in Turkey; it was registered under this status in 2000.

In 2009, the largest enclosed shopping centre in the city and region, Sanko Park, opened, and began drawing a significant number of shoppers from Syria.

Ties between Turkey and Syria have severely deteriorated since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011.

==Demographics==
Gaziantep is mostly inhabited by Turks. It is also inhabited by a significant minority of Kurds, about 450 thousand people, and roughly 470 thousand Syrian refugees.

===History===
In early 14th century, Arab geographer Dimashki noted that the people of Aintab were Turkomans. Aintab continued to be Turkish or Turkoman majority through 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Armenians inhabited Aintab from at least 10th century until the Armenian genocide. Having abandoned Armenian in favour of Turkish as early as the 16th century, the Armenians of Aintab predominantly spoke Turkish, while the usage of Armenian increased after 1850. The city also housed a smaller Jewish minority predominantly of Sephardic origin. The Jewish population quickly decreased in mid-20th century, reaching zero people by 1980s. Unlike most Southeastern Anatolian cities, the city of Gaziantep did not have a significant Kurdish minority until the 20th century, when it saw an increase in its Kurdish population through economically motivated migration from Turkish Kurdistan. Up until the late 2010s, the Kurdish population increased to one fourth of the city and the province with 400,000 - 450,000 Kurds. In the late Ottoman era, the city included a number of Europeans and Americans. Aintab also had a sizable Uzbek minority dating back to the Ottoman rule.


==Culture==
===Cuisine===

Gaziantep is largely regarded as the city with the richest cuisine in Turkey. It was the first city in Turkey to be designated as a City of Gastronomy by UNESCO in 2015. In 2013, Gaziantep baklava became the first Turkish product with a European protected designation of origin and geographical indication.

The cuisine of Aintab was attested to be &quot;rich&quot; by many travellers throughout the centuries. 19th-century British traveller noted: 

Types of kofta (; Gaziantep dialect: &quot;küfte&quot;) include &quot;içli küfte&quot; ( &#x27;stuffed kofta&#x27;), &quot;sini küfte&quot;, &quot;yoğurtlu küfte&quot;, &quot;yağlı küfte&quot; ( &#x27;greasy kofta&#x27;), &quot;tahinli küfte&quot;, &quot;pendir ekmekli küfte&quot; ( &#x27;kofta with bread and cheese&#x27;), and more. Some koftas do not include any meat such as &quot;yapma&quot; and &quot;malhıtalı küfte&quot; ( &#x27;lentil kofta&#x27;).

Pilafs in the Aintab cuisine often accompany the main dish and are not the main course alone. Traditionally, bulgur is used for the pilafs. The bulgur pilafs can include orzo (; &quot;Şʿāreli burgul pilov&quot;) or ground beef ( or , &#x27;tavern pilaf&#x27;).

There are several types of exclusively-Armenian soups in Aintab cuisine. These include vardapet soup and &quot;omız zopalı&quot;.

Vegetable dishes of Aintab often include meat but can be vegetarian as well. These include &quot;dorgama&quot; (), moussaka, &quot;bezelye&quot;, &quot;bakla&quot;, &quot;kuru fasulye&quot;, &quot;mutanya&quot;, &quot;türlü&quot;, and &quot;kabaklama&quot;. Dolma is a very common dish, different variants of which are cooked. One is &quot;kış dolması&quot; ( &#x27;winter dolma&#x27;), for which dried vegetables, such as squash, eggplants, and peppers are used. 
Common sweets include &quot;bastık&quot; and &quot;sucuk&quot;.
===Local Turkish dialect===
The local Turkish dialect of Gaziantep is classified as a part of the Western Turkish dialects based on phonetic and grammatical similarities. The dialect carries influences mainly from Armenian and Arabic. The local Turkish dialect of Gaziantep is an integral part of the native identity of the city and is being preserved through often humorous plays by theatrical troupes, such as &quot;Çeled Uşaglar&quot; ( naughty children).

===Museums===
The Gaziantep Museum of Archaeology has collections of ceramic pieces from the Neolithic Age; various objects, figures and seals from the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages; stone and bronze objects, jewellery, ceramics, coins, glass objects, mosaics and statues from the Hittite, Urartu, Greek Persian, Roman, Commagene, and Byzantine periods.

====Other====
Zeugma is an ancient city which was established at the shallowest passable part of the river Euphrates, within the boundaries of the present-day Belkıs village in Gaziantep Province. Due to the strategic character of the region in terms of military and commerce since antiquity (Zeugma was the headquarters of an important Roman legion, the &quot;Legio IV Scythica&quot;, near the border with Parthia) the city has maintained its importance for centuries, also during the Byzantine period.

Gaziantep Castle, also known as &quot;Gala&quot; ( &#x27;the castle&#x27;), located in the centre of the city displays the historic past and architectural style of the city. Although the history of castle is not fully known, as a result of the excavations conducted there, Bronze Age settlement layers are thought to exist under the section existing on the surface of the soil.

Pişirici Kastel, a &quot;kastel&quot; (fountain) which used to be a part of a bigger group of buildings, is thought to have been built in 1282. &quot;Kastels&quot; are water fountains built below ground, and they are structures peculiar to Gaziantep. They are places for ablution, prayer, washing and relaxation.

==Sports==
Beslenspor has played in the Turkish Basketball League between 1986 and 1992 and presented Gaziantep at basketball once.

==Cityscape==
The historical core of Gaziantep is located on the Alleben Creek to the north and with heights to the south. The location of the city among these heights was likely because of their defensibility.

Historically, the main trade axis was the route from the castle then going southeast along the road to Aleppo. A number of hans were built along this street. Due to the hot climate, the city&#x27;s streets were very narrow in order to maximize shade from the buildings. Orientation of buildings was important so they could not see into each other&#x27;s courtyards (an important private space, especially for women) and so that they would not block sunlight from neighboring houses.

Generally, the city&#x27;s population was organized according to ethno-religious groups who lived close together in the same neighborhood. Around the time of World War I, the city&#x27;s population was divided between Muslims in the east and non-Muslims (mostly Armenians) in the west. Muslims lived in the Karagöz, Çukur, Tıslaki, and Şekeroğlu districts; Armenians lived in the Akyol and Bey districts; and Jews lived in the Düğmeci and Karagöz districts.

An early city planning effort took place in 1891 under Mustafa Ağa, the first mayor of Gaziantep, involving a city plan and province map. According to Kuyucu and Özer, though, the resulting maps and plans are unavailable. Another early city plan for Gaziantep was drawn up by Barsumyan and Nazaryan in the early 1920s, during the Turkish War of Independence. The Barsumyan-Nazaryan plan included an airport for the city but omitted any railway connections. During this period, because the Jewish and Armenian communities had left the city during the war period, the city did not expand into new areas; instead, now-vacant neighborhoods were used to meet new demand.

===The Jansen plan (1938)===
In the first years of the Republic of Turkey, new city planning laws were enacted requiring all major cities to have development plans. In 1938, the Gaziantep municipality requested that Hermann Jansen draw up a plan for the city. The resulting Jansen plan was the first large-scale city planning initiative in Gaziantep, and many of its proposals were ultimately put into action.

The Jansen plan sought to preserve the existing urban character of Gaziantep while also planning new areas outside the traditional core. It mainly focused on new development on the north, south, and west sides of the city. New industrial zones were drawn up along important transportation arteries, particularly the Nizip and Aleppo roads. The most important was a 33-hectare industrial zone on the north side of town, which was to be connected to the railway network. The new industrial area was specifically chosen to be on the northeast because the prevailing wind direction is from the northwest, so this way air pollution would not be blown over the city.

The plan introduced several important changes to the city&#x27;s transportation network. One of the most important was the addition of a rail line to connect Gaziantep to the national rail system. Up to now, Turkish railway construction had ignored Gaziantep (partly because of its mountainous surroundings); a national railway plan also introduced in 1938 left Gaziantep unconnected to the rail network. The Jansen plan represented the first major proposal to construct a railway to Gaziantep. Jansen wanted to put the train station on the north side of the city, for multiple reasons. First, because the topography on the north side is flatter; and second, because putting a railway on the south side would separate the old town from the new planned residential areas further south, which Jansen wanted to avoid.

Jansen also planned significant changes to the city&#x27;s streets, opening up several new boulevards and widening pre-existing streets to help make a continuous transportation network. He proposed combining the Narlı and Aleppo roads into İsmet İnönü Caddesi, which was to be the main transportation axis of the city. The existing commercial axis along the Aleppo road, lined with hans and marketplaces, was to be expanded with new commercial buildings along the new İnönü Cd. The plan also sought to create a SW-NE axis connecting the Kilis and Nizip roads by way of İstasyon Caddesi in the north and Atatürk Caddesi in the west; this axis would also be connected to İnönü Cd. Two important pre-existing streets in the old town, Suburcu Cd and Eski Saray Cd, would also be expanded and connected with these other streets. Finally, besides road and rail, Jansen also proposed the construction of an airport on the west side of town.

One of the most important features of the Jansen Plan was the designation of a green belt along Alleben Creek, running east–west across the entire city, where no construction was to take place. This would provide a large open recreational area. Jansen also proposed a large area to the north of the creek to be used for sports fields and a hippodrome, although these were never built.

The Jansen plan zoned for new residential areas to the south of the old city. This may have been done to follow the pre-existing main axis along the southbound Aleppo road. It may have also been because Jansen wanted the existing houses of the old city to be visible from the south. He wanted to build new residential areas in a similar fashion, with two-story houses arranged on parallel streets that followed the slope of hills. In order to provide space for the southward residential expansion, Jansen proposed that the pre-existing cemetery on the south side of town be moved to a new planned location in the northeast.

To the northwest of the old city, Jansen wanted to build one-story houses among vineyards in a low-density agricultural area. The proposed workers&#x27; quarter, in the northeast near the planned industrial zone, was to follow a similar plan, with low-cost single-story houses.

For the city&#x27;s new administrative buildings, Jansen chose to develop the Çukurbostan area, located in the old city center but with some vacant space available. In a departure from his typical policy of not modifying the old urban fabric, also proposed demolishing some existing buildings and altering the pre-existing street layout to accommodate this new construction.

====Impact====
Many elements of the Jansen plan were ultimately put into action, and it had a significant influence on how Gaziantep was built during the 20th century. It especially shaped the city&#x27;s transport network: the construction of a rail line on the north side, the opening of new transportation axes such as İnönü Cd, and the expansion of existing roads were all realized. The expansion of commercial areas along the old Aleppo road led to the development of İnönü Cd as one of the city&#x27;s main commercial axes, a role it still plays today. The airport area he proposed, however, was never built – in the 1950s, as urbanization and population growth created new demand, the area was turned into a residential zone instead.

The planned residential expansion to the south did take place, as did the proposed relocation of the cemetery to the northeast, but ultimately the main direction of residential expansion shifted to the northwest instead. This is partly because the hilly area to the south is less conducive for construction. The industrial zone on the northeast was built, but the adjacent workers&#x27; quarter never materialized. Although the recreational areas to the north were never built, the Alleben green belt became an important green space in the city, and it remains to this day (although some of it has since been turned over for new construction). Jansen&#x27;s recommendation of low-rise development also succeeded at preserving the silhouette of the city until the 1970s.

One failing of the Jansen plan was that it significantly underestimated the population growth of the city during the next 50 years, particularly after 1945. This lack led to the growth of uncontrolled, unplanned settlements in the city. In addition, Jansen&#x27;s general non-intervention policy with the old city center proved insufficient to maintain its character – in the absence of managed oversight, many old buildings ended up deteriorating, ultimately getting demolished, and then being replaced with new structures that architecturally did not blend in.

===The Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan (1955)===
By the 1950s, Gaziantep&#x27;s rapid growth was outpacing the Jansen plan&#x27;s limits, resulting in the creation of unplanned settlements (such as Karşıyaka in the north and Düztepe in the south) and prompting the creation of a new city plan. This plan, drawn up by Kemal Ahmet Aru and Hamit Kemali Söylemezoğlu in 1955, continued the basic principles of the Jansen plan while adding some revisions. The city&#x27;s shape remained compact and focused around a single center, which was now being extended towards the south and west.

The main goal of the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan was to provide new housing to meet the needs of the growing urban population. There was also an effort to shift from agriculturally-oriented economy to industrial.

Among the important features introduced in the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan were the railway station, now in its current location, and the addition of the new İpek Yolu highway as a northwards continuation of İstasyon Cd. The new planned upscale residential neighborhoods of Bahçelievler, Kavaklık, and Öğretmenevleri signalled a shift towards building new neighborhoods to the southwest. Ordu Cd, a westward extension of Atatürk Cd, was opened up, and the Kilis-Aleppo axis shifted to this route. In general, the Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan planned a grid plan for the city&#x27;s streets.

The area north of Alleben Creek, which under the Jansen plan had been designated as recreational areas, were converted into residential development under Aru-Söylemezoğlu plan. Several small new industrial areas were also developed around Nizip Cd, Araban Yolu, and İpek Yolu.

===The Can plan (1973)===
In 1973, a competition was organized under the supervision of İller Bank to draft a third city zoning plan for Gaziantep; it was held simultaneously with ones in Konya and Kayseri. The Gaziantep contest was won by a team led by Zühtü Can and also including Yalçın Alaybeyoğlu, Abdullah Dellaloğlu, Müzeyyen Can, and Haluk Aral. The resulting Can plan consisted of several stages guiding the city&#x27;s development until a target year of 1995, when they projected a population of 1 million for Gaziantep.

The Can plan focused on developing Gaziantep as an industrial center, with an increasing share of land dedicated to industrial use. These industrial areas were also increasingly set apart from residential areas. The Can plan envisioned a three-pole city with industrial areas at the west and east ends and new residential development in the south. Gaziantep&#x27;s Organized Industrial Zone had been established in 1969 and was one of the first in Turkey. By 1978, manufacturing had reached 11.6% of Gaziantep&#x27;s GDP, compared to about 17% for the country as a whole.

The 1970s were Gaziantep&#x27;s highest period of immigration. New residential development during this period was clustered into two main areas. The first area was neighborhoods on the south and east sides of town like Karşıyaka, Düztepe, and Çıksorut, where many manufacturing jobs were available. The second consisted of areas on the north and west where relatively higher-income people who worked in the service sector lived. The patterns for urban development differed between these two areas. In the south and east, there was an irregular settlement pattern formed by purchasing land around factories. In the north and west, there was a regular grid of wide streets lined with houses and apartment complexes.

Beginning in the mid-1980s, the Can plan was undermined by illegal building and zoning amnesties, which disrupted the plan&#x27;s form and caused the city to grow in unplanned ways. The municipal government tried to address the situation by performing piecemeal interventions to rehabilitate these areas, but ultimately the effect was that poorly integrated pockets of the city were formed.

===The Aldan plan (1990)===
The problem of illegal construction in the late 80s, combined with the introduction of the Metropolitan Municipality Law and changes to national zoning regulations such as Zoning Law 3194 (both giving cities increased authority in urban planning as opposed to the central government), necessitated an updated city plan. This plan, the fourth one in Gaziantep&#x27;s history, was drafted in 1990 by H. Oğuz Aldan. The Aldan plan had a target year of 2005, with a predicted population of about 1.8 million. It planned for the city to expand to 8010 ha, of which 26% would be residential, 22% would be industrial, and 17% would be open green spaces.

The Aldan plan followed a metropolitan, polycentric model, with new commercial zones mixed in with the residential areas to serve as secondary urban centers. The main directions for new development were toward the west and south. A new ring road on the east, south, and west helped boost growth in these directions. Some of the new secondary centers were built in the Karataş and İbrahimli areas. Another major addition was a new commercial area on the east side of the city called the Gaziantep Ticaret ve Endüstri Merkezi (Gaziantep Trade and Industry Center), or GATEM for short. Located on the Araban-Adıyaman highway, on the city&#x27;s outskirts, the GATEM was to occupy 40 ha and also include an intercity bus terminal.

===In the 21st century===
Since the 2000s, a number of smaller-scale targeted projects have taken place, such as local rezoning of industrial areas in the Ünaldı neighborhood; reworking unplanned settlements that do not meet building standards; and various other development projects (for example in areas like Bağlarbaşı, Geneyik, Sarıgüllük, Halep Bulvarı, Kilis Yolu, and Orta Tepe).

===Zoo===
Gaziantep Zoo is one of the largest zoos in Turkey. Especially interesting are the bird pavilion and the aquarium. Gaziantep Zoo offers a large variety of animals, attractive picnic grounds, and a cafeteria. The facility is established on field. There are 264 species and 6,814 animals.

<text>Dubliners is a collection of fifteen short stories by James Joyce, first published in 1914. It presents a naturalistic depiction of Irish middle class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century.

The stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak, and a search for a national identity and purpose was raging; at a crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by various converging ideas and influences. Joyce felt Irish nationalism, like Catholicism and British rule of Ireland, was responsible for a collective paralysis. He conceived of &quot;Dubliners&quot; as a &quot;nicely polished looking-glass&quot; held up to the Irish and a &quot;first step towards [their] spiritual liberation&quot;.

Joyce&#x27;s concept of epiphany is exemplified in the moment a character experiences self-understanding or illumination. The first three stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists, while the subsequent stories are written in the third person and deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people, in line with Joyce&#x27;s division of the collection into &quot;childhood, adolescence, maturity, and public life&quot;. Many of the characters in &quot;Dubliners&quot; later appeared in minor roles in Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

==Publication history==
Between 1905, when Joyce first sent a manuscript to a publisher, and 1914, when the book was finally published (on 15 June), Joyce submitted the book 18 times to a total of 15 publishers. The London house of Grant Richards agreed to publish it in 1905. Its printer, however, refused to set one of the stories (&quot;Two Gallants&quot;), and Richards then began to press Joyce to remove a number of other passages that he claimed the printer also refused to set. Under protest, Joyce eventually agreed to some of the requested changes, but Richards ended up backing out of the deal.

Joyce submitted the manuscript to other publishers, and, about three years later (1909), he found a willing candidate in Maunsel &amp; Roberts of Dublin. A similar controversy developed, and Maunsel too refused to publish the collection, even threatening to sue Joyce for printing costs already incurred. Joyce offered to pay the printing costs himself if the sheets were turned over to him and he was allowed to complete the job elsewhere and distribute the book, but, when he arrived at the printers, they refused to surrender the sheets and burned them the next day, though Joyce managed to save one copy, which he obtained &quot;by ruse&quot;. He returned to submitting the manuscript to other publishers, and in 1914 Grant Richards once again agreed to publish the book, using the page proofs saved from Maunsel as copy.

==The stories==
* &quot;The Sisters&quot; – After the priest Father James Flynn dies, a young boy who was close to him hears some less-than-flattering stories about the father.
* &quot;An Encounter&quot; – Two schoolboys playing truant encounter a perverted, middle-aged man.
* &quot;Araby&quot; – A boy falls in love with the sister of his friend Mangan, but fails in his quest to buy her a worthy gift from the Araby Bazaar.
* &quot;Eveline&quot; – The young Eveline Hill weighs her decision to flee Ireland with a sailor, Frank, to &#x27;Buenos Ayres&#x27;.
* &quot;After the Race&quot; – College student Jimmy Doyle tries to fit in with his wealthy friends.
* &quot;Two Gallants&quot; – Lenehan wanders around Dublin to kill time while waiting to hear if his friend, Corley, was able to con a maid out of some money.
* &quot;The Boarding House&quot; – Mrs Mooney successfully manoeuvres her daughter Polly into an upwardly mobile marriage with her lodger, Bob Doran.

Also originally considered for the &quot;Dubliners&quot; collection was a short story called &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;. It was rejected by the author, though a sentence of it was later reincorporated into &quot;Clay&quot;.

== Style ==
Besides first-person and third-person narration, &quot;Dubliners&quot; employs free indirect discourse and shifts in narrative point of view. The collection progresses chronologically, beginning with stories of youth and progressing in age to culminate in &quot;The Dead&quot;. Throughout, Joyce can be said to maintain &quot;invisibility&quot;, to use his own term for authorial effacement. He wrote the stories &quot;in a style of scrupulous meanness&quot;, withholding comment on what is &quot;seen and heard&quot;. &quot;Dubliners&quot; can be seen as a preface to the two novels that will follow, and like them it &quot;seeks a presentation so sharp that comment by the author would be interference&quot;.

Joyce&#x27;s modernist style entailed using dashes for dialogue rather than quotation marks. He asked that they be used in the printed text, but was refused. &quot;Dubliners&quot; was the only work by Joyce to use quotation marks, but dashes are now substituted in all critical and most popular editions.

The impersonal narration doesn&#x27;t mean that Joyce is undetectable in &quot;Dubliners&quot;. There are autobiographical elements and possible versions of Joyce had he not left Dublin. The Dublin he remembers is recreated in the specific geographic details, including road names, buildings, and businesses. Joyce freely admitted that his characters and places were closely based on reality. (Because of these details, at least one potential publisher, Maunsel and Company, rejected the book for fear of libel lawsuits.) Ezra Pound argued that, with the necessary changes, &quot;these stories could be retold of any town&quot;, that Joyce &quot;gives us things as they are... for any city&quot;, by &quot;getting at the universal element beneath&quot; particulars.

Joyce referred to the collection as &quot;a series of epicleti&quot;, alluding to the transubstantiation of bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. He is said to have &quot;often agreed... that &#x27;imagination is nothing but the working over of what is remembered. But he used the eucharist as a metaphor, characterizing the artist as &quot;a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life&quot;.

The theme of &quot;Dubliners&quot;, &quot;what holds [the stories] together and makes them a book [is] hinted on the first page&quot;, the &quot;paralysis&quot; or &quot;living death&quot; of which Joyce spoke in a letter of 1904.

The concept of &quot;epiphany&quot;, defined in &quot;Stephen Hero&quot; as &quot;a sudden spiritual manifestation&quot;, has been adapted as a narrative device in five stories in &quot;Dubliners&quot;, in the form of a character&#x27;s self-realization at the end of the narrative. One critic has suggested that the concept is the basis of an overall narrative strategy, &quot;the commonplace things of Dublin [becoming] embodiments or symbols . . . of paralysis&quot;. A later critic, avoiding the term &quot;epiphany&quot;, but apparently not the concept, has examined in considerable detail how &quot;church and state manifest themselves in &quot;Dubliners&quot;&quot; as agents of paralysis. There are numerous such &quot;manifestations&quot;.

What immediately distinguishes the stories from Joyce&#x27;s later works is their apparent simplicity and transparency. Some critics have been led into drawing facile conclusions. The stories have been pigeonholed, seen as realist or naturalist, or instead labeled symbolist. The term &quot;epiphany&quot; has been taken as synonymous with symbol. Critical analysis of elements of stories or stories in their entirety has been problematic. &quot;Dubliners&quot; may have occasioned more conflicting interpretations than any other modern literary work.

It&#x27;s been said that &quot;Dubliners&quot; is unique, defying any form of classification, and perhaps no interpretation can ever be conclusive. The only certainty is that it&#x27;s a &quot;masterpiece&quot; in its own right and &quot;a significant stepping-stone . . . into the modernist structure of Joyce&#x27;s mature work&quot;.

===Christ in &quot;Dubliners&quot;===
On 10 June 1904, Joyce met Nora Barnacle for the first time. They met again on 16 June. On both days, the Feast of the Sacred Heart was celebrated in Irish Catholic churches. The feast originated on another 16 June, in 1675. A young nun, Margaret Mary Alacoque, had visions of Christ exposing his heart. During the so-called &quot;great apparition&quot; on that date, he asked that a new feast be established to commemorate his suffering. (In the Library episode, Mulligan calls the nun &quot;Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!&quot;) The Feast of the Sacred Heart was formally approved in the same year. The Jesuits popularized the devotion, and Ireland was the first nation to dedicate itself to the Sacred Heart.

The young nun claimed that Christ had made 12 promises to all who would dedicate themselves to the Sacred Heart. The 12th promise offers &quot;salvation to the one who receives communion on nine consecutive First Fridays&quot;. Mrs. Kiernan in the &quot;Dubliners&quot; story &quot;Grace&quot; and Mr. Kearney in &quot;A Mother&quot; try to take advantage of this promise, as did Stephen&#x27;s mother. A colored print of the 12 promises hangs on Eveline&#x27;s wall, and there are resemblances between her and Margaret Mary Alacoque and between Frank, her &quot;open-hearted&quot; suitor, and the Sacred Heart. Both young women have been made a promise of salvation by a man professing love. Hugh Kenner argues that Frank has no intention of taking Eveline to Buenos Aires and will seduce and abandon her in Liverpool, where the boat is actually headed. Since &quot;going to Buenos Aires&quot; was slang for &quot;taking up a life of prostitution&quot;, it appears that Frank does intend to take Eveline to Buenos Aires, but not to make her his wife. That Eveline&#x27;s print of the 12 promises made by the Sacred Heart hangs over a &quot;broken&quot; harmonium confirms the close similarity between the two suitors. In &quot;Circe&quot;, the Sacred Heart devotion is concisely parodied in the apparition of Martha Clifford, Bloom&#x27;s pen pal. She calls Bloom a &quot;heartless flirt&quot; and accuses him of &quot;breach of promise&quot;.

==Media adaptations==
* Hugh Leonard adapted six stories as &quot;Dublin One&quot;, which was staged at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in 1963.
* In 1987, John Huston directed a film adaptation of &quot;The Dead&quot;, written for the screen by his son Tony and starring his daughter Anjelica as Mrs. Conroy.
* In October 1998, BBC Radio 4 broadcast dramatisations by various writers of &quot;A Painful Case&quot;, &quot;After the Race&quot;, &quot;Two Gallants&quot;, &quot;The Boarding House&quot;, &quot;A Little Cloud&quot;, and &quot;Counterparts&quot;. The series ended with a dramatization of &quot;The Dead&quot;, which was first broadcast in 1994 under the title &quot;Distant Music&quot;. The broadcasts were accompanied by nighttime abridged readings of other stories from &quot;Dubliners&quot;, starting with &quot;Ivy Day in the Committee Room&quot; (in two parts, read by T. P. McKenna), and continuing with &quot;The Sisters&quot;, &quot;An Encounter&quot;, &quot;Araby&quot;, &quot;Eveline&quot;, and &quot;Clay&quot; (all read by Barry McGovern).
* In 1999, a short film adaptation of &quot;Araby&quot; was produced and directed by Dennis Courtney.
* In 2000, a Tony Award-winning musical adaptation of &quot;The Dead&quot; premiered, written by Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey and directed by Nelson.
* In April 2012, Stephen Rea read &quot;The Dead&quot; on RTÉ Radio 1.
* In February 2014, Stephen Rea read all fifteen stories spread across twenty 13-minute segments of &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot; on BBC Radio 4.
* In July 2014, Irish actor Carl Finnegan released a modern retelling of &quot;Two Gallants&quot; as a short film. Finnegan wrote the script with Darren McGrath and also produced, directed, and performed the role of Corley in the film.
* In May 2023, Irish folk music act Hibsen released the album &quot;The Stern Task of Living&quot;, inspired by &quot;Dubliners&quot;. The 15-track album by duo Gráinne Hunt and Jim Murphy follows the sequence of the stories in the novel, with each song based on the story after which it is named.

<doc id="569058" wikidata="Q7142196" url="?curid=569058" title="Paskahousu">
<text>Paskahousu (; &quot;scaredy pants&quot;) is a popular Finnish card game for two to six players, but three to five are best. The object of the game is to play higher cards than the previously played cards, first to get replacement cards from the stock pile, and, after the stock pile has exhausted, to get rid of one&#x27;s cards.

The game has many rule variations, some of which are described. One of the most widespread variants is Valepaska, in which the cards are played face down, and players don&#x27;t need to announce their plays truthfully.

== Rules ==
The following rules are based on those at pagat.com.

=== Deal ===
One deck of 52 cards is used, with cards ranking in descending order as follows: 2 A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3. Twos, Tens and Aces have special privileges. Each player is initially dealt five cards (2–2–1). The rest of the cards form a face-down stock.

=== Play ===
In turn each player, with or without drawing the top card from the stock, places one or more cards of the same rank from their hand onto a pile next to the stock according to the following rules:
* If the pile is empty, any card (or set of cards) may be played to start it.
* If the pile is not empty, the new cards must be of at least the same rank than the previous cards in the pile.
* Twos can be played on any card except an ace or ten. Only a two can be played on top of another two.
* Nothing can be played on a ten except another ten; likewise only an ace may be played on an ace.
* If the top card is lower than a seven, no court cards may be played.
* Aces can only be played onto a court card or another ace.

A player who cannot or does not want to play, must take the entire pile in hand and the turn rotates left.

A player who, after playing, has fewer than five cards in hand, must draw cards from the top of the stock to bring the hand up to five cards. Obviously this is only possible if the stock is not exhausted. 

A player who gets rid of all their cards after the stock has been exhausted is &quot;out&quot; and does not participate in the game any more. The first player to go out is the winner. The loser is the player who has cards left when everyone else has gone out. In some circles the loser is called &quot;paskahousu&quot;.

== Variants ==
=== Valepaska ===
In Valepaska, also called Valepaskahousu and Kusetuspaskahousu and often considered standard &quot;Paskahousu&quot; in English literature, the cards are played face down, and players announce the cards that they play (for example &quot;one jack&quot; or &quot;three eights&quot;). Players are allowed to lie, and plays may be challenged by any other player. In a challenge, the played cards are exposed: if the play was honest, the challenger must pick the pile up (and the challenged player starts the new pile); if the play was deceitful, the challenged player takes the pile (and play passes to the next player). Only the immediately preceding play may be challenged.

According to Finnish website Korttipelit (card games), there are no standard rules for which player continues play following a challenge. The website recommends that an exposed liar never start the new pile.

=== Pöytäpaska ===
Pöytäpaska (&quot;Table Paskahousu&quot;) also known as Espanjalainen paskahousu (&quot;Spanish Paskahousu&quot;) In addition to their regular hands, each of the 2–3 players is dealt four face-down cards and four face-up cards. These cards are played after the stock and the cards in the player&#x27;s hand have been exhausted. The face-up cards are played first. The player can then attempt to play the face-down cards without looking at their rank. If the play is not in accordance with the rules, the player must pick up the entire pile into their hand. These cards in hand must be played before the player can attempt to play another face-down card.

To avoid deadlocks and lengthy games, some rules may be relaxed after the stock is depleted, such as:
*rules restricting the play of court cards
*rule that the ace does not clear the play pile
*rule restricting the play of the ten
*rule restricting the play of other cards on a two

=== Ruotsalainen paskahousu ===
In Ruotsalainen paskahousu (&quot;Swedish Paskahousu&quot;) all the cards are dealt, and there is no stock. The game proceeds like the ordinary Paskahousu.

=== Miscellaneous rule variations ===
These rules can be used with the basic game or with any of the variants mentioned above.

==== Four same cards fall piles ====

* Four twos do not cause the pile to &quot;fall&quot;. (This rule is recommended in particular for &quot;Valepaska&quot;.)
* Four same cards do not cause the pile to &quot;fall&quot;. Only aces and tens &quot;fall&quot; piles.

==== Face cards ====

* Face cards can be only played on the top of eights and higher.
* Face cards can be played on the empty table and on the top of all smaller cards (except for twos.) Aces can be played on the top of the face cards.
* Face cards can be played on the empty table and on the top of all smaller cards (except for twos) after the stock has exhausted.
* Face cards can be played on the empty table and on the top of eights and higher.
* One is allowed to play only one face card per turn.

==== Aces and tens on an empty table ====

* A player is allowed to play an ace on an empty pile, but then the next player must take it and the same player plays again.
* A player is allowed to play an ace on an empty pile, but then the next player must take it, and the turn passes to the left.
* Both tens and aces work like aces in the previous point.

==== Lack of playable card ====

* If a player does not have a suitable card to play, they are allowed to attempt to play the top card from the stock. If this play is not in accordance with the rules, the player must take up the entire pile (including the card they attempted to play) into their hand.

<text>Percy Heath (April 30, 1923 – April 28, 2005) was an American jazz bassist, brother of saxophonist Jimmy Heath and drummer Albert Heath, with whom he formed the Heath Brothers in 1975. Heath played with the Modern Jazz Quartet throughout their long history and also worked with Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Wes Montgomery, Thelonious Monk and Lee Konitz.

==Biography==
Heath was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, United States, and spent his childhood in Philadelphia. His father played the clarinet and his mother sang in the church choir. He started playing violin at the age of eight and also sang locally. He was drafted into the Army in 1944, trained with the Tuskegee Airmen, graduating as a 2nd Lieutenant pilot, but saw no combat.

Deciding after the war to go into music, he bought a stand-up bass and enrolled in the Granoff School of Music in Philadelphia. Soon he was playing in the city&#x27;s jazz clubs with leading artists. In Chicago in 1948, he recorded with his brother on a Milt Jackson album, as members of the Howard McGhee Sextet. After moving to New York in the late 1940s, Percy and Jimmy Heath found work with Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s groups. Around this time, Percy was also a member of Joe Morris&#x27;s band, together with Johnny Griffin.

It transpired that other members of the Gillespie big band, pianist John Lewis, drummer Kenny Clarke, Milt Jackson, and bassist Ray Brown, decided to form a permanent group; they were already becoming known for their interludes during Gillespie band performances that, as AllMusic.com stated, gave the rest of the band much-needed set breaks – that would eventually become known as the Modern Jazz Quartet (MJQ). When Brown left the group to join his wife Ella Fitzgerald&#x27;s band, Heath joined and the group was officially begun in 1952, with Connie Kay replacing Clarke, who left in January 1955. The MJQ played regularly until it disbanded in 1974; it reformed in 1981 and last recorded in 1993.

In 1975, Percy Heath and his brothers formed the Heath Brothers with pianist Stanley Cowell. Percy would sometimes play the cello instead of the bass in these later performances.

As a sideman, he performed on approximately 300 recording dates in a career of more than 57 years.

In 1989, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

In 2003, at the age of 80, Heath released his first album as a leader through the Daddy Jazz label. The album, entitled &quot;A Love Song&quot;, garnered rave reviews and served as a fitting coda for his illustrious career. It featured brother Albert Heath on drums, bassist Peter Washington and pianist Jeb Patton.

Percy Heath died, after a second bout with bone cancer, two days short of his 82nd birthday, in Southampton, New York. The month after his death, bassist William Parker recorded the tribute album &quot;For Percy Heath&quot;.

Heath was an avid striped bass fisherman, and surfcaster, who could be found on many a day, along the surf line of his beloved Montauk Point. He was well respected by the community, and his fellow fishermen. He also relished time away from the stage on his fishing boat, appropriately named &quot;The Fiddler&quot;, kept in Montauk as well. On May 27, 2006, a plaque was set into a 5,000lb stone, at Turtle Cove, at Montauk Point, as a memorial. The ceremony was attended by his wife, June, and three sons.

<text>Zonguldak () is a city of about 100 thousand people in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It is the seat of Zonguldak Province and Zonguldak District. It was established in 1849 as a port town for the nearby coal mines in Ereğli. The current mayor is Tahsin Erdem, representing the CHP.

==Etymology==
There are several different theories concerning the origin of the city&#x27;s name:
* That it comes from &quot;Zone Geul-Dagh&quot;, the name given to the area by French and Belgian mining companies from French &quot;zone&quot; and a French spelling of Turkish Göldağı (&#x27;Lake Mountain&#x27;), the highest mountain in the vicinity of the Devrek district.
* That the name came from Turkish which means &quot;swamp&quot;, or .
* That the name may derive from the name of the nearby ancient settlement of Sandaraca or Sandarake (in Ancient Greek Σανδαράκη).
* That the name may have come from &quot;jungle&quot; (which the French entrepreneurs called the area due to its uneven wooded geography) plus Turkish &#x27;mountain&#x27;.

In a 1920 report, the British Foreign Office spelled Zonguldak &quot;Zunguldak&quot;.

==History==
The port city of Zonguldak suffered a heavy bombardment by the Russians during World War I, according to the caption of a Lubok popular print.

As of 1920, the port was under the control of the Heraclea Coal Company. The northern part of the bay featured a man-made harbor, for steamship use. At that time, they had two cranes which distributed coal to exporting vessels.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification, Zonguldak has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), though it was, until recently, considered to have an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), with its warmest month being well below the 22 °C threshold. In recent decades climate change and the city&#x27;s urban heat island has warmed the city enough to change its classification. Summers are warm, the average temperature is around 22.5 °C in July and August. Winters are cool, the average temperature is around 6 °C in January and February. Precipitation is frequent, while it is generally heaviest in autumn and early winter, lightest (although still frequent) in spring. Snow is sporadic in winter, but is heavy once it occurs.

The water temperature is cool to mild and fluctuates between 8 °C and 20 °C throughout the year.

==Health==
It was determined that coal-related lung diseases are more common than normal. During the quarantine period in Turkey, Zonguldak was also quarantined in addition to the metropolitan cities.

== Economy ==
Jobs in coal in Turkey are being lost and in 2020 the EBRD proposed a just transition. However a 2021 study said the city was unprepared for coal-phase out. In 2024 a local journalist alleged that hundreds of Afghans were being employed in illegal coal mines, and in 2024 a court case re the death of an Afghan was ongoing.

==Transportation==


The city is the terminus of a railway line to Irmak, with the terminating station Zonguldak Railway Station built in 1937.

==International relations==
Zonguldak is twinned with:
* Brindisi, Apulia, Italy
* Castrop-Rauxel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany
* Kherson, Kherson Oblast, Ukraine
* Monfalcone, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy

== Notable people ==

Ergün Penbe - Turkish former footballer

Murat Boz - Turkish singer-songwriter and actor

Nilgün Efes - Turkish entrepreneur and journalist

<text>Saqqez (; ; ) is a city in the Central District of Saqqez County, Kurdistan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

== Etymology ==

The name Saqqez derives from the Scythian word &quot;&quot;Eskit&quot; and then &quot;Sakez&quot;&quot;. Before that, it was Izirtu, the capital of Mannaeans. In some historical sources it has been mentioned that the name of the city is derived from the name of powerful Median ruler Cyaxares (reigned 625–585 BC), who turned the empire into a regional power, but other historians believe that the name of the city is derived from &quot;Sakez&quot; and is attributed to the Scythians who settled in the city during the reign of Cyaxares.

== History ==

Saqqez&#x27;s history goes back to the seventh millennium BC. Based on historical ruins and Antiques which have been found in Saqqez, like the historical treasures of Ziwiye hoard in the Ziwiyeh Castle, experts like Roman Ghirshman believe that the modern city of Saqqez is built on the site of the ancient capital of the Median kingdom. When the Assyrian king Sargon II (reigned 722 – 705 BC) attacked the Median kingdom, he forced them to flee to Ecbatana (modern day Hamadan) and made this city his capital. On the attack of Sargon II, the ruler of Assyria, the Medes were defeated and their fortifications were destroyed. Thereafter, the Scythians tried to rebuild this city and they chose Saqqez, then named Eskit as their capital. This city was repeatedly attacked by Assyrians and Romans.

According to Vladimir Minorsky, Saqqez is the site of the earlier medieval city of Barza. According to Theophanes the Confessor, who calls the city &quot;Barzan&quot; (), the Byzantine emperor Heraclius stayed at Barza for seven days in March 628 while on his way to Ganzak. Barza was an important crossroads in the medieval period, where there was a fork in the road from Dinavar to Maragheh with one branch splitting off towards Urmia. In the early 9th century, Barza was the capital of a separate principality.

==Demographics==
===Language and ethnicity===
Most of the people in this city are Kurds who speak the Sorani dialect of the Kurdish language. David D&#x27;Beth Hillel (d. 1846) stated that the city was home to a small Jewish community with one synagogue dating from around 1827.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 131,349 in 31,336 households. The following census in 2011 counted 139,738 people in 37,262 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 165,258 people in 48,488 households.

== Geography ==
=== Geology ===
The city of Saqqez is built on long plains and hills, which are crossed by the main tributaries of rivers such as Zarrineh River and Simineh River. The lowlands and heights inside the city and the view of Saqqez River that passes through the center of this city are its special features. Saqqez is located in mountainous and highlands between the irregular heights of Zagros Mountains, and this special geomorphological feature has led to relatively cold climates and long winters and sometimes frost.

=== Climate ===
At an altitude of 1,476 metres (4,842 feet), Saqqez has a Mediterranean continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dsa&quot;) with hot, very dry summers and cold, snowy winters. Summers feature large diurnal temperature variation due to decreased air density at high altitude and low humidity. In 1969 Saqqez recorded a temperature of , the lowest ever recorded by an Iranian weather station until Kheirabad Zanjan recorded on January 29, 1997. Saqqez again reached −36 °C during the February 3–9 1972 Iran blizzard.

Saqqez unofficially reached in December 2006 and in January 2007, the lowest temperatures recorded in an Iranian city. Rainfall is mild throughout the year, with late winter and early spring having the most precipitation, and the summers being practically rainless. Due to the foehn effect, the rainfall is not as heavy as it is in the exposed sites of the Zagros to the west, such as in Sardasht, which lies on the same altitude but is more exposed to the westerly cold front systems.

== Culture and art ==
The city of Saqqez has been a place of culture and art since ancient times. In this city, performing arts and culture has a special place, and artists have created valuable works in various fields of art such as theater, painting, sculpture, music, literature, poetry, and cinema. In this city, every year at the end of the autumn season, a theater festival called The Kurdish Theater Festival is held, in which theater groups from all over Kurdistan perform their works. Also, in Saqqez, famous musicians and singers, such as Rashid Fayznejad perform their music and songs in the Kurdish language. Also there are well-known poets in this city, such as Abdul Karim Sahib, Mullah Ghafoor Dabbaghi, Jila Hosseini, Rahim Loghmani, Malekoalkalam majdi and Sheikh Hassan Molanabad.

==Transportation==
This city has an airport and a central bus terminal. Saqqez Airport officially started working after 18 years on November 3, 2023 with the presence of the President of Iran. This airport covers several cities in the western part of Iran and a population of nearly one and a half million people, especially Baneh and Marivan free trade zones.

<doc id="569071" wikidata="Q3618213" url="?curid=569071" title="Free-air gravity anomaly">
<text>In geophysics, the free-air gravity anomaly, often simply called the free-air anomaly, is the measured gravity anomaly after a free-air correction is applied to account for the elevation at which a measurement is made. It does so by adjusting these measurements of gravity to what would have been measured at a reference level, which is commonly taken as mean sea level or the geoid.

== Applications ==
Studies of the subsurface structure and composition of the Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle employ surveys using gravimeters to measure the departure of observed gravity from a theoretical gravity value to identify anomalies due to geologic features below the measurement locations. The computation of anomalies from observed measurements involves the application of corrections that define the resulting anomaly. The free-air anomaly can be used to test for isostatic equilibrium over broad regions.

== Survey methods ==
The free-air correction adjusts measurements of gravity to what would have been measured at mean sea level, that is, on the geoid. The gravitational attraction of Earth below the measurement point and above mean sea level is ignored and it is imagined that the observed gravity is measured in air, hence the name. The theoretical gravity value at a location is computed by representing the Earth as an ellipsoid that approximates the more complex shape of the geoid. Gravity is computed on the ellipsoid surface using the International Gravity Formula. 

For studies of subsurface structure, the free-air anomaly is further adjusted by a correction for the mass below the measurement point and above the reference of mean sea level or a local datum elevation. This defines the Bouguer anomaly.

== Calculation ==

The free-air gravity anomaly formula_1 is given by the equation:

:formula_2

Here, formula_3 is observed gravity, formula_4 is the &quot;free-air correction&quot;, and formula_5 is theoretical gravity.

It can be helpful to think of the free-air anomaly as comparing observed gravity to theoretical gravity adjusted up to the measurement point instead of observed gravity adjusted down to the geoid. This avoids any confusion of assuming that the measurement is made in free air. Either way, however, the Earth mass between the observation point and the geoid is neglected. 
The equation for this approach is simply rearranging terms in the first equation of this section so that reference gravity is adjusted and not the observed gravity:

:formula_6

=== Correction ===
Gravitational acceleration decreases as an inverse square law with the distance at which the measurement is made from the mass. The free air correction is calculated from Newton&#x27;s Law, as a rate of change of gravity with distance:

:formula_7
At 45° latitude, formula_8 mGal/m.

The free-air correction is the amount that must be added to a measurement at height formula_9 to correct it to the reference level:
:formula_10

Here we have assumed that measurements are made relatively close to the surface so that R does not vary significantly. The value of the free-air correction is positive when measured above the geoid, and negative when measured below. There is the assumption that no mass exists between the observation point and the reference level. The Bouguer and terrain corrections are used to account for this.

== Significance ==
Over the ocean where gravity is measured from ships near sea level, there is no or little free-air correction. In marine gravity surveys, it was observed that the free-air anomaly is positive but very small over the Mid-Ocean Ridges in spite of the fact that these features rise several kilometers above the surrounding seafloor. The small anomaly is explained by the lower density crust and mantle below the ridges resulting from seafloor spreading.  This lower density is an apparent offset to the extra height of the ridge indicating that Mid-Ocean Ridges are in isostatic equilibrium.

<text>Sitiawan(alternate spelling: Setiawan; origin: from Malay, a portmanteau of &quot; &quot;, meaning &quot;Loyal Friend&quot;) is a mukim and town in Manjung District, Perak, Malaysia.

The region spans an area of . In the year 2000, the population was 95,920 and by 2015, has grown to more than 150,000. Sitiawan (&quot;mukim&quot;), is located at .

==History==
Folklore makes reference to Sitiawan of the past as Kampung Sungai Gajah Mati. It was a thriving settlement for Fuzhounese (Foochow) migrants. They were predominantly from the Gutian County in Fuzhou, China.

According to the folklore, Kampung Sungai Gajah Mati (literally: &quot;Dead Elephant River Village&quot;) was the place where two large elephants drowned after one of them, overladen with tin ore, got stuck in the mud of the Dinding River at low tide. Efforts to save the elephant were in vain and eventually, everyone gave up and left. However, the second elephant refused to budge and hung on to its friend, resulting in them drowning together in the rising tide. Thus the &quot;setia kawan&quot; (loyal friend) name was derived.

In late 19th century, tin ores and rubber sheets were main commodities for commerce. They were often transported by elephants and then loaded onto steamships heading for Penang. During the 1870s, a smallpox outbreak struck the settlement and locals chose to rename the locality Setia Kawan — the &quot;loyal friend&quot;—to honor and appease the spirits of the dead elephants. This action is also in line with the Chinese beliefs of naming a place to enhance its feng-shui. Over time, the name is shortened and eventually became &quot;Sitiawan&quot;.

In September 1903, the settlement experienced an influx of more than 360 Christian Fuzhou immigrants seeking refuge from violence during the Qing dynasty. The Chinese Christians were attacked by the Boxer rebels, also known as Yihetuan in Chinese (义和团), and the Qing dynasty government supported their cause, causing a violent conflict in Fujian in 1901 known as the Boxer Rebellion. The Chinese Christians were led by two Chinese pastors and settled down in what is today known as Kampung Koh. Most of these immigrants worked in rubber plantations in Sitiawan. The Fuzhou settlers also built four wells, two in the 1930s and another two in the 1950s. These heritage wells still exist but are no longer used.

Chin Peng, who led the Malayan Communist Party for many years, was born in Sitiawan in 1924.

==Climate==
Sitiawan has a Tropical rainforest climate (Af).

==Demographics==
Sitiawan&#x27;s population is primarily Chinese—56.2% Chinese, 23.9% Malay, 19.4% Indian and 0.5% other.

=== Politics ===

==Precipitation==
Sitiawan is one of the driest places after Kuala Klawang Town (Jelebu), Malacca City (Malacca) and Lubok Merbau (Perak) in Malaysia with average annual rainfall of a little under . Most of the time, the average rainfall is just above with October and November being wetter months while June is the driest month of the year.

In recent years Sitiawan has suffered from haze swept in by winds from raging open fires in Sumatra, Indonesia.

==Economy==
Sitiawan grew from a small settlement with rubber tapping and latex processing as its main economic activities. The town was flanked by various Chinese settlements composed mostly of the descendants of immigrants from the Kutien district of Fuzhou, China. The original settlers were encouraged by the British to plant rice. The settlers, however, found that paddy-planting is not suited to the soil of the region and so they switched to livestock farming before discovering that the land was much better suited for rubber plantations.

The rapid development of urban settlements saw the plantation and estate areas develop, and eventually converted into residential and commercial areas. In the 1980s, a large remainder of the rubber estates underwent mass conversions into oil palm plantations, due to better yield and profits compared to rubber sheets and latex. Oil palm is less labour-intensive crop compared to rubber, as rubber needs to be tapped regularly.

Tourism has not been a major economic activity, but the town centre derives some economic advantages from its close proximity to Pangkor Island which is a famous niche tourist destination.

The development of the town had been rapid in the 1990s. One of the main reasons was the establishment of the Royal Malaysian Navy&#x27;s Naval Base in Lumut, approximately 10 km from the town centre. The Naval Base is currently the largest in Malaysia. The base has acted as a catalyst for the development of commercial activities in the town, serving both the residents of the base and sailors visiting from other countries.

Located at the western coast of Perak with direct access to the Straits of Malacca, it is no surprise that port-related activities, marine services and industries play a major role. Its main port, Lumut Port consists of the Lumut Maritime Terminal (LMT) and Lekir Bulk Terminal (LBT) and it serves the surrounding regions and the state of Perak. LMT, a Royal Malaysian Customs Gazetted Port, is a river port, located along the banks of the Dindings River. The Terminal is an integrated common user port facility, and is International Ship Port Security code compliant. Since 1995, the Terminal has been improved and upgraded and its facilities have been extended to include additional open and covered storage. The main berth has been extended for another 280m in 2001, with the alongside depth of 12m ACD, resulting in a total overall linear berth length of 510m.

LBT is a deepwater seaport, and with a natural depth of 20 metres, LBT is currently South-East Asia&#x27;s largest dry bulk unloading facility. The terminal is capable of berthing an entire range of vessels in Panamax and Capemax ships up to 165,000 DWT. LBT is designed to handle dry bulk cargoes. It currently is a dedicated terminal to handle coal for Station Janakuasa Sultan Azlan Shah (TNBJ) in Seri Manjung.

An industrial zone, Lumut Port Industrial Park (LPIP), located within Lumut Port itself with direct sea, trade access, is home to various industries and companies. LPIP is home to companies such as Sapura Kencana Petroleum Berhad, an oilfield service company, Kencana Torsco Sdn. Bhd., B.I.G. Industrial Gas Sdn. Bhd., IMPSA, etc. In recent years, bio-diesel, oleo and palm oil based companies have been set up due to the proximity to its raw material source.

A secondary jetty, located at Teluk Rubiah is built and managed by Vale Malaysia Minerals Sdn Bhd, a Brazilian mining giant. It was built as a transshipment hub for iron ore. The raw material is brought in from Brazil in gigantic 400,000 DWT bulk carriers some 360 metres in length. The Vale Jetty serves a maximum 90 million tonnes per annum of iron ore and functions as entry and exit points for all material including iron ore, sinter pellets, blast furnace pellets and pelletizing plant additives. The jetty is designed to bring in incoming iron ore from the largest bulk carrier of 400,000 DWT Valemax, and to export it with a maximum of 80,000 DWT panamax size vessel.

The project has been controversial due to environmental concerns. Fears expressed by civic groups and local residents concern the destruction of the environment, the livelihood of locals, particularly fishermen, and beach-side tourism. Nevertheless, the nearby Outward Bound School has alleged that part of the jungle is inaccessible to its teams. Other education and training institutions are also barred from entering the area. Consumer and environmental groups have joined in the condemnations with claims that the ecosystem of the area, formerly gazetted as a forest reserve, would be destabilised. The plant is located on a 450-acre site which was originally a Permanent Forest Reserve but the state government re-gazetted it to an ‘Industrial Zone’. The Perak Department of Wildlife and National Parks said that the area is rich in flora and fauna and protected under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. The site is surrounded by mature and regenerating natural primary forest whilst the bird life and mammals are protected by national and international laws. The area is also home to leopards, white-bellied eagles and the endangered palm plant, &quot;Phoenix paladosa&quot;.

Another major industry is its rich rubber latex resource, YTY Industry Sdn Bhd, a world leader in Nitrile Gloves production for examination and surgical use, TNB JanaManjung Sdn Bhd an independent power generation company, TNB&#x27;s Sultan Aziz Shah Coal-Fired Power Plant and several other industrial manufacturing and mining companies.

==Education==


There are many schools in Sitiawan, such as Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Ahmad Boestamam, Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan Nan Hwa, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Convent Sitiawan, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan ACS (Anglo Chinese School) Sitiawan, Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tok Perdana. The first mentioned school is named after Ahmad Boestamam, an historical figure who helped to gain independence from the British.

SMJK Nan Hwa was previously a private Chinese school which had been converted into a partially subsidised government school which uses the Chinese medium. Nan Hwa was founded in 1935 from the amalgamation of the High School section of 4 Chinese primary schools (Chung Cheng Primary School, Kuok Min Primary School, Uk Dih Primary School and Uk Ing Primary School) in the Sitiawan area. Ong Seok Kim was elected as first Chairman of the School Board in 1936 and again in 1946 to 1947. Its 70th anniversary was celebrated on 1 September 2006 in SMJK Nan Hwa school hall. A thousand-person dinner was held at the Ku Tien Association Hall to commemorate that auspicious day.

There are 24 Chinese primary schools and 5 Chinese secondary schools in the district. Of these, 5 schools were founded by Ong Seok Kim. They are SJK (C) Chung Cheng, Sitiawan in 1920, SMJK Nan Hwa (which split into Sekolah Tinggi Nan Hwa, Ayer Tawar Road in 1984) in 1935, SJK (C) Ping Min, Lumut in 1951 and SMJK Dindings, Lumut in 1953. Ong Seok Kim died in 1964. The following year, the Manjung community established the Ong Seok Kim Memorial Education Fund in his honour. The Fund offers scholarships and loans to students in the Manjung District, irrespective of ethnicity.

SMK Methodist ACS Sitiawan, formerly an English school, was founded by Christian missionaries back in 1903. It is currently a national school under the Malaysian education system and subjects are taught in Bahasa Malaysia. Its 100th anniversary was celebrated in 2003 and it is also the oldest secondary school in Sitiawan. ACS is the first school in Manjung district to have established a scout troop.

==Fuzhou heritage==
Sitiawan is known for its strong Fuzhou heritage. Various traditional Foochow dishes such as red rice wine vermicelli, &quot;Kompiang&quot; or &quot;Kong Piang&quot; (traditional Fuzhou buns made with a type of unleavened flatbread stuffed with seasoned pork and baked in a clay oven), as well as &quot;Go-row&quot; (; a thick sweet and sour broth cooked with fish maw) are cooked in both restaurants and homes. Local dishes such as red rice wine and Fuzhou vermicelli continue to play an important role in the livelihood and traditions of those living in or from Kampung Koh.

==Modern Sitiawan==

In recent years, intense development on routes connecting Lumut, Seri Manjung and Sitiawan have brought prosperity and pollution to what was once a relatively quiet town. The primary industries within Sitiawan are rubber production, manufacturing of rubber gloves, palm oil production, mineral ores, fishing, fisheries and shipbuilding.

Around the year 2000, Sitiawan residents began to get involved in swiftlet bird breeding activity. This activity was partly attributed to the development of two major roads which indirectly &quot;disconnect&quot; Kampung Koh and Simpang Empat from traffic travelling to Lumut. All traffic was directed to the planned township of Seri Manjung. All local government administrative offices were also relocated to Manjung in recent years. This development renders shop and small business owners in Kampung Koh and Simpang Empat obsolete, resulting in many businesses shutting down. Empty shop lots were later converted to become shelters for swiftlets. At its peak about 8–10 years ago, swiftlet breeding caused property prices to skyrocket.

Sitiawan also is known for the Tua Pek Kong temple located 15 minutes from the town. The temple has monumental statues and structures. A row of statues carved to resemble Chinese deities are situated in the garden area of the temple facing the Pasir Panjang seashore.

<text>The Barbarian Football Club, known as the &quot;Barbarians&quot;, is a British-based invitational rugby union club. The Barbarians play in black and white hoops, though players wear socks from their own club strip. Membership is by invitation. As of 2011, players from 31 countries had played for them. Traditionally at least one uncapped player is selected for each match.

Until rugby union became a professional sport, the Barbarians usually played six annual matches: with Penarth, Cardiff, Swansea and Newport at Easter; a game with Leicester on 27 December and the Mobbs Memorial Match against East Midlands in the spring. In 1948, the Barbarians were invited to face Australia as part of the Wallabies&#x27; tour of Britain, Ireland and France. Although initially designed as a fundraiser towards the end of the tour, the encounter became a popular and traditional fixture. Initially played every three years, it has become more frequent in the professional era, with the Barbarians now often playing one of the national teams visiting Britain each autumn.

On 29 May 2011, at halftime in the Barbarians&#x27; match against England at Twickenham, the Barbarians and their founder William Percy Carpmael were honoured with induction to the IRB Hall of Fame. A women&#x27;s team was established in 2017.

Many rugby clubs around the world are based on the Barbarians model of an invitational scratch team, including the French Barbarians, Australian Barbarians, New Zealand Barbarians and South African Barbarians.

==History==

The Barbarian Club was formed by William Percy Carpmael, who had played rugby for Cambridge University, and had been part of the Cambridge team which had undertaken a tour of Yorkshire in 1884. Inspired by the culture behind short rugby tours he organised his first tour in 1889 with Clapham Rovers, which was followed by an 1890 tour with an invitational team calling themselves the Southern Nomads. At the time practically every club ceased playing in early March; there were no tours and players just &#x27;packed up&#x27; until the following season. In 1890 he took the Southern Nomads – mainly composed of players from Blackheath – on a tour of some northern counties of England.

His idea – collecting a touring side from all sources to tackle a few leading clubs in the land – received strong support from leading players, particularly ex-university players. On 8 April 1890, in Leuchters Restaurant and later at the Alexandra Hotel in Bradford, the concept of the Barbarians was agreed upon. The team toured later that year and beat Hartlepool Rovers 9–4 on 27 December in their first fixture.

The team was given the motto by Walter Julius Carey, former Bishop of Bloemfontein and a former member of the Barbarians:


===Penarth===

The concept took hold over the years and the nearest thing to a club home came to be the Esplanade Hotel at Penarth in South Wales, where the Barbarians always stayed on their Easter tours of Wales. The annual Good Friday game against the Barbarians was the highlight of the Penarth club&#x27;s year and was always attended by enthusiastic capacity crowds. This fixture marked the start of the Baa-Baas&#x27; annual South Wales tour from their &quot;spiritual home&quot; of Penarth, which also included playing Cardiff RFC on the Saturday, Swansea RFC on Easter Monday and Newport RFC on the Tuesday.

The non-match day of Easter Sunday would always see the Barbarians playing golf at the Glamorganshire Golf Club, in Penarth, while the former Esplanade Hotel, which was located on the seafront at Penarth, would host the gala party for the trip, sponsored by Penarth RFC. The first match took place in 1901, and over the next 75 encounters, Penarth won eleven games, drew four and lost 60. Between 1920 and the first Athletics Field game in 1925, the Good Friday games were hosted on Penarth County Grammar School&#x27;s sports field.

The final Penarth v Barbarians game was played in 1986, by which time the Penarth club had slipped from its prominent position in Welsh rugby. However, a special commemorative game, recognising the 100 years since the first Good Friday match, took place in 2001 and was played at the Athletic Field next to the Penarth clubhouse the day before the Barbarians played Wales at the Millennium Stadium. Gary Teichmann, captain of South Africa and the Barbarians, unveiled a plaque at the clubhouse to mark the event.

===The Final Challenge===
After the Second World War, in 1948, the Barbarians were asked by the British and Irish unions to raise a side to play the touring Australia team, to raise funds for the Australians&#x27; journey home via Canada. This started the tradition of the &quot;Final Challenge&quot; – played as the last match in a tour of Britain and Ireland by Australia, New Zealand or South Africa.

====&#x27;The best try ever scored&#x27;====

The Barbarian &#x27;Final Challenge&#x27; match with the All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park on 27 January 1973 is celebrated as one of the best games of rugby union ever played. It was a game of attack and counterattack, and the Barbarians won the match 23–11, handing the All Blacks their fourth defeat of the tour. Gareth Edwards scored a try widely considered to be one of the best ever in rugby union.

Cliff Morgan described Gareth Edwards&#x27; try:
Gareth Edwards said of the match:
===Traditional matches===
The nature of the Barbarians as a touring side made for a diverse fixture list, but at a number of points in the club&#x27;s history they have settled for a time into a regular pattern. Most of these regular matches have fallen by the wayside, whilst others continue to the present day:

* &quot;27 December game against Leicester Tigers&quot; – this began in 1909 as the third and final match of the Christmas Tour. It was played for the last time as a regular fixture in March 2006 but returned in November 2014 when the Barbarians beat Leicester 59–26 in their 125th anniversary season.
* &quot;The Edgar Mobbs Memorial Match&quot; – held for Edgar Mobbs, who was killed in the First World War. Played at Franklins Gardens against Northampton Saints, Bedford Blues or the East Midlands select XV. The first took place on 10 February 1921, and in later years became a tradition on the first Thursday in March. The last Mobbs Match to feature the Barbarians took place in April 2011. Since then, the invited opposition has been a British Army side instead of the Barbarians.
* &quot;Easter Tour&quot; – traditionally four matches against Penarth RFC (Good Friday), Cardiff RFC/Cardiff Blues (Holy Saturday); Swansea RFC (Easter Monday) and Newport RFC (Tuesday following Easter Monday). The Penarth match was dropped after 1986 as a regular fixture although in 2001 a special commemorative game, recognising 100 years since the first Good Friday match, was played at the Athletic Field next to the Penarth clubhouse the day before the Barbarians played Wales at the Millennium Stadium. The game against Newport was moved away from Easter after the 1982 fixture due to problems fielding a team for the fourth match of the tour and was played as a midweek game early in the season from September 1982 onwards. The Barbarians last played Newport in November 1996.
* &quot;The Final Challenge&quot; – played as the last match in a tour of the UK by Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. Initially played every three years, these games have become more frequent in the professional era. The fixture on 3 December 2008 between the Barbarians and Australia was played at Wembley Stadium, the first rugby union match played there since its redevelopment.
* Remembrance Day game against the Combined Services, played in November. The fixture was first played in 1997 and the most recent game, in 2014, resulted in a 31–15 win for the Barbarians.

They typically compete against teams from the home nations (England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland) as well as other international sides. Other matches are played against club teams, often to celebrate anniversaries. The 2014–15 fixture list included matches against Leicester Tigers and Heriot&#x27;s Rugby Club in addition to the Final Challenge game with Australia and the annual Combined Services match. The Heriot&#x27;s game celebrated the 125th anniversary of both that club and the Barbarians, while the Leicester game was also part of the Barbarians&#x27; 125th anniversary schedule. The Barbarians were also invited to play in the first ever Rugby match at the London Olympic Stadium in 2015 against Samoa.

===Olympic rugby union centenary celebration match===
Australia was approached by the British Olympic Association to play the Barbarians at Wembley Stadium on 3 December 2008. The match formed part of the BOA&#x27;s programme of events to celebrate the centenary of the first London Olympic Games where Australia defeated a Great Britain (Cornwall) side in the final 32–3. In 1908 France were the defending Olympic champions, but when they withdrew from the event, leaving just Australia and Great Britain to contest the gold medal, it was then County champions Cornwall who took to the field to represent the host nation. Cornwall had already been defeated in Australia&#x27;s earlier 31-match tour. Cornwall&#x27;s 1908 contribution was also further recognised by the presentation of the Cornwall Cup to the winning 2008 captain at Wembley, with the players of the respective sides receiving gold or silver commemorative medals. The 2008 game was the first rugby union fixture to take place in the new Wembley Stadium. Australia went on to win 18 points to 11.

In a change to the tradition of the Barbarians players wearing their own club socks, in this game, they all wore Cornwall&#x27;s black and gold socks. The break with the tradition was highly regarded by the secretary of the Cornwall Rugby Football Union, Alan Mitchell, who was said to have been humbled by the honour.

===Women&#x27;s team===

In October 2017 a women&#x27;s team was announced for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Their first match was a 19–0 victory against Munster on 10 November 2017, played as part of a double header with the men&#x27;s team playing Tonga. They subsequently played a match against the British Army in March 2018, winning 37–0.

Their first-ever match against international competition saw six tries scored in a 34–33 victory against the USA at Infinity Park in the Denver suburb of Glendale, Colorado. On 2 June 2019, Barbarians Women took on England at Twickenham as the prelude to a men&#x27;s Barbarians match against an England XV (non-cap match) losing the contest 40–14 (two tries scored to six conceded). They went on to beat Wales at the Principality Stadium 43–33 on 30 November 2019 scoring 5 tries to 3 conceded.

<doc id="569079" wikidata="Q1416417" url="?curid=569079" title="Valedictorian">
<text>Valedictorian is an academic title for the highest-performing student of a graduating class of an academic institution in the United States.

The valedictorian is generally determined by an academic institution&#x27;s grade point average (GPA) system but other methods of selection may be factored in such as volunteer work, scholastic awards, research, and extra-curricular activity.

== Origin ==
The term is an Anglicised derivation of the Latin (&quot;to say farewell&quot;), historically rooted in the valedictorian&#x27;s traditional role as the final speaker at the graduation ceremony commencement before the students receive their diplomas. The valedictory address, also known as the valediction, is generally considered a final farewell to classmates, before they disperse to pursue their individual paths after graduating.

=== Other terms ===
The term is not widely used outside the United States, Canada, and the Philippines, although some countries may award equivalent titles. In Australia, the title is sometimes awarded to a member of a graduating university class on the basis of a contribution to the school rather than academic success. The highest-ranking student in a graduating class is often referred to as (Latin for &quot;leader&quot;), and may or may not give a speech. In France the term (&quot;first in class&quot;) is used, although the term is not related to any ceremonial role, as there are rarely graduation ceremonies in schools or universities.

== Selection ==
The most common method of selection is typically based upon the highest grade point average. Some institutions confer the title on the class member chosen to deliver the final graduation address, regardless of the speaker&#x27;s academic credentials. Historically and traditionally, however, schools confer the title upon the top ranked graduate of the class, whether determined by GPA or some other means such as a faculty vote, who thereby earns the honor of delivering the valedictory address.

Some institutions award the title based upon various criteria such as an overall academic record of grades and credits, a student&#x27;s grade point average, the level of rigor within a student&#x27;s academic program of studies, a vote by school administrators, the level of participation in and dedication to extracurricular activities, and one&#x27;s public-speaking skills and abilities. In other schools, the position may be elected by the school body or appointed directly by the school administration based on various systems of merit. Some schools may feature &quot;co-valedictorians&quot; in lieu of conferring the title on a single individual from among the graduating class. This may occur in the case of a numerical tie in grade point averages, as part of a Latin honors system.

=== Controversy ===
The awarding of the valedictorian honor may be the subject of controversy. Often the differences separating the top student from the nearest competitors are small, and sometimes there are accusations that the winner took advantage of the rules in a way that seemed unfair, such as taking easy courses to get additional credits. Some schools have dropped the honor or changed the rules to allow multiple recipients. In turn, such changes have led to complaints that it is unfair to change the rules after a competition has begun. The New Jersey Commissioner of Education, for example, required schools to make changes to valedictorian award policy effective only for the incoming freshman class, not students already enrolled. 

In 2003, a New Jersey case raised the question of whether accommodations for students under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and related laws should affect valedictorian honors. In &quot;Hornstine v. Township of Moorestown&quot;, a U.S. District Court judge blocked the Moorestown Superintendent of Schools from retroactively changing school policy to deny a disabled student sole honors. While those who do well in school often find success in university and professional life, one study claimed to show that valedictorians were not any more likely to excel at a global scale than other students, with the argument being made that those with passions for subjects are more likely to excel, yet those same students tend to find it more difficult to work hard at subjects that they are not interested in.

== Valedictory address ==

The valedictory address, or valediction, is the closing or farewell statement delivered at a graduation ceremony. It is an oration at commencement (in Canada, called convocation in university and graduation in high school) exercises in U.S. and some Canadian high schools, colleges, and universities delivered by one of the graduates. The mode of discourse generally is inspirational and persuasive. The various aims of this address are to inspire the graduates and to thank individuals responsible for their successes while reflecting on youthful frivolity and the accomplishments of the class. Above all, however, the primary aim of the valedictory address is to allow a representative of the graduating class to bid a final farewell to the students and to the school, as the graduates prepare to disperse and to begin the next phase of their lives.

<doc id="569080" wikidata="Q7406322" url="?curid=569080" title="Salutatorian">
<text>Salutatorian is an academic title given in Armenia, the Philippines and the United States to the second-highest-ranked graduate of the entire graduating class of a specific discipline. Only the valedictorian is ranked higher. This honor is traditionally based on grade point average (GPA) and number of credits taken, but consideration may also be given to other factors such as co-curricular and extracurricular activities. The title comes from the salutatorian&#x27;s traditional role as the first speaker at a graduation ceremony, delivering the salutation (where the valedictorian, on the other hand, speaks last, delivering the valediction). In a high school setting, a salutatorian may also be asked to speak about the current graduating class or to deliver an invocation or benediction. In some instances, the salutatorian may even deliver an introduction for the valedictorian. The general themes of a salutation and valediction are usually of growth, outlook towards the future, and thankfulness.

== College ==

=== Latin salutatorian ===
At Harvard University and Princeton University, a Latin orator, often a classics major, is chosen for his or her ability to write and deliver a speech to the audience in that language. At Princeton, this speaker is known as the &quot;Latin salutatorian&quot;. At Harvard the Latin oration is called the &quot;Latin Salutatory&quot; and is the first of three student orations, and fulfills the traditional function of salutation. These traditions date from the earliest years of the universities, when all graduates were expected to have attained proficiency in Latin and Greek.

Notable Latin salutatorians at Harvard include T.S Eliot in 1909 and Erich Segal in 1958.

<text>Digital rectal examination (DRE), also known as a prostate exam (), is an internal examination of the rectum performed by a healthcare provider.

Prior to a 2018 report from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a digital exam was a common component of annual medical examination for older men, as it was thought to be a reliable screening test for prostate cancer.

==Usage==
This examination may be used:
* for the diagnosis of prostatic disorders, benign prostatic hyperplasia and the four types of prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, chronic bacterial prostatitis, acute (sudden) bacterial prostatitis, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. The DRE has a 50% specificity for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Vigorous examination of the prostate in suspected acute prostatitis can lead to seeding of septic emboli and should never be done. Its utility as a screening method for prostate cancer however is not supported by the evidence;
* for the evaluation of certain clinical symptoms: a male with change in urinary ability, impotence, or dysuria (blood in the urine), pain with bowel movements;
* a DRE with a FOBT might have value for a person with anemia in the emergency room who has no other identifiable cause for anemia, is not actively bleeding, and there is concern that gastrointestinal malignancy may be the cause for their anemia;
* a true active gastrointestinal bleed: vomiting blood, vomiting coffee-grind like material, defecating blood or &quot;black&quot; tarry stools that can not be easily attributed to facial trauma or oral surgery, eating beets or anything with red food dye or overuse of NSAIDS/over the counter pain medication. Doing a rectal exam to examine stool color may provide a clue as to the location of the bleed but is not a reliable indicator;
* for the diagnosis of appendicitis or other examples of an acute abdomen (i.e. acute abdominal symptoms indicating a serious underlying disease). Although a &quot;Journal of Emergency Medicine&quot; paper concludes: &quot;We found the DRE to have a limited role in the diagnosis of acute, undifferentiated abdominal pain and acute appendicitis.&quot;;
* for the estimation of the muscle tone of the anal sphincter, which may be useful in case of fecal incontinence or neurologic diseases, including traumatic spinal cord injuries;
* traditionally, the digital rectal examination (DRE) was considered an essential part of the physical examination for all trauma patients. However, the sensitivity of the DRE for injuries of the spinal cord, pelvis, and bowel is poor, and false positive and negative results are common. Thus, routine performance is unnecessary and generally unhelpful. The examination is warranted in cases where urethral injury or penetrating rectal injury is suspected;
* in females, for the limited gynecological palpations of internal organs when the vaginal vault cannot be accessed or it is too painful (vaginal atrophy);
* for examination of the hardness and color of the feces (i.e. in cases of constipation, and fecal impaction);
* prior to a colonoscopy or proctoscopy;
* to evaluate hemorrhoids although internal hemorrhoids are often too soft to be felt, a visual inspection may be more useful;
* in newborns to exclude imperforate anus;
* through the insertion of medical devices including thermometers or specialized balloons; to identify digestion problems, parasites, organ damage, anal bruising, and foreign objects in the rectal cavity;

== Usage as a screening tool ==

=== In colorectal cancer screening of asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 75 ===
* Even though 1 in 4 colorectal cancers (CRC) is located in the rectum, little evidence supports the effectiveness of using the DRE for rectal cancer detection and it is not recommended in the colorectal cancer screening guidelines. The DRE is inadequate as a screening tool for colorectal cancer because it examines less than 10% of the colorectal mucosa; sigmoidoscopy is preferred.
* Although the DRE is commonly used as a way to obtain a stool sample for a FOBT (fecal occult blood test) in an office based setting, &quot;this is an insufficient way of screening for colorectal cancer and is not recommended.&quot; A single office-based FOBT (fecal occult blood test) performed following a digital rectal examination (DRE) is not an adequate screen due to low sensitivity for advanced tumor and colorectal cancer. Screening for colon cancer this way does not meet HEDIS, Medicare or American Cancer Society standards. The FOBT has never been validated for any purpose other than as a take home colon cancer screening test. A paper published in the &quot;Journal of General Internal Medicine&quot; states, &quot;While FOBT done appropriately (taken home and used according to the instructions) is an important screening option, in-office FOBT may be worse than no screening at all because it misses 95% of cases of advanced tumor, giving many patients a false sense of reassurance.&quot;

=== In prostate cancer screening of asymptomatic men aged 55 to 69 ===
* In men aged 55–69 who have been counseled on the known harms and potential benefits of prostate cancer screening, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force May 2018 statement states, &quot;The use of digital rectal examination as a screening modality is not recommended because there is a lack of evidence on the benefits.&quot; The American Academy of Family Physicians states, &quot;Digital Rectal Exam does not improve detection of prostate cancer and should not be performed as a part of screening.&quot; The American Urological Association 2013 (reviewed and validity confirmed 2018) guideline panel states, &quot;The literature supporting the efficacy of digital rectal exam (DRE) for screening with the goal of reducing prostate cancer mortality provide limited evidence to draw conclusions.&quot; &quot;The guideline panel could find no evidence to support the continued use of DRE as a first-line method of screening.&quot; Although DRE has long been used to diagnose prostate cancer, no controlled studies have shown a reduction in the morbidity or mortality of prostate cancer when detected by DRE at any age.
* A meta-analysis published in the &quot;Annals of Family Medicine&quot; concluded: &quot;Given the considerable lack of evidence supporting its efficacy, we recommend against routine performance of DRE to screen for prostate cancer in the primary care setting.&quot;

==Procedure==
The digital rectal examination is a relatively simple medical procedure. The patient undresses and is then placed in a position where the anus is accessible (lying on the side, squatting on the examination table, bent over it, or lying down with feet in stirrups). If the patient is lying on their side, the physician will usually have them bring one or both legs up to their chest. If the patient bends over the examination table or the back of a chair, the physician will have them place their elbows on the table and squat down slightly. If the patient uses the supine position, the physician will ask the patient to slide down to the end of the examination table until their buttocks are positioned just beyond the end and then place their feet in the stirrups. The physician spreads the buttocks apart and will usually examine the external area (anus and perineum) for any abnormalities such as hemorrhoids, lumps, or rashes. Then, as the patient relaxes and bears down (as if having a bowel movement), the physician slips a lubricated finger into the rectum through the anus and palpates the insides for a short time.
==Society and culture==
Due to the taboos surrounding the anus and the potential for discomfort and embarrassment, the rectal exam is a common comedic device, including in episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Impractical Jokers&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Letterkenny&quot;, and the movie &quot;Fletch&quot;, with M. Emmet Walsh as the general practitioner and Chevy Chase as the patient being examined. Similar activities to the rectal exam are attributed to extraterrestrials in video games such as &quot;Saints Row IV&quot;, &quot;Gaia Online&quot; and &quot;Destroy All Humans!&quot;. The practice of rectal exams without prior consent by medical students has been an area of concern. In 2024, the US Department of Health and Human Services banned rectal examination (and pelvic and breast exams) without written informed consent, when such exams are undertaken by medical students, nurse practitioners, or physician assistants for &quot;educational and training purposes&quot;.

==Veterinary medicine==
In veterinary medicine rectal examination is useful in dogs for analysis of the prostate (as in men), pelvic urethra, sublumbar lymph nodes, and anal glands. In horses it is a vital component of the clinical examination for colic, to determine the presence or absence of bowel torsion, impaction, or displacement. When horses undergo a rectal examination there is a small risk of a rectal tear occurring, which can be a life-threatening event, rapidly leading to peritonitis and septic shock. It is also a common procedure in cattle, and is one method of diagnosing pregnancy in both the horse and the cow.

The procedure in dogs and cats is similar to humans. For the horse, the patient stands in a stock and may be sedated. The examiner puts on a long glove that extends to the shoulder. The examiner inserts the hand and arm into the rectum as far as necessary.

<doc id="569092" wikidata="Q2706556" url="?curid=569092" title="Behavioral modernity">
<text>Behavioral modernity is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits believed to distinguish current &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; from other anatomically modern humans, hominins, and primates. Most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking, planning depth, symbolic behavior (e.g., art, ornamentation), music and dance, exploitation of large game, and blade technology, among others.

Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically by evolutionary and cultural anthropologists. These human universal patterns include cumulative cultural adaptation, social norms, language, and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin.

Within the tradition of evolutionary anthropology and related disciplines, it has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits, in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Period and Last Glacial Maximum causing population bottlenecks, contributed to the evolutionary success of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; worldwide relative to Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other archaic humans.

Debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well. There are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity. These approaches tend to fall into two camps: cognitive and gradualist. The Later Upper Paleolithic Model theorizes that modern human behavior arose through cognitive, genetic changes in Africa abruptly around 40,000–50,000 years ago around the time of the Out-of-Africa migration, prompting the movement of some modern humans out of Africa and across the world.

Other models focus on how modern human behavior may have arisen through gradual steps, with the archaeological signatures of such behavior appearing only through demographic or subsistence-based changes. Many cite evidence of behavioral modernity earlier (by at least about 150,000–75,000 years ago and possibly earlier) namely in the African Middle Stone Age. Anthropologists Sally McBrearty and Alison S. Brooks have been notable proponents of gradualism—challenging Europe-centered models by situating more change in the African Middle Stone Age—though this model is more difficult to substantiate due to the general thinning of the fossil record as one goes further back in time.

== Definition ==

To classify what should be included in modern human behavior, it is necessary to define behaviors that are universal among living human groups. Some examples of these human universals are abstract thought, planning, trade, cooperative labor, body decoration, and the control and use of fire. Along with these traits, humans possess much reliance on social learning. This cumulative cultural change or cultural &quot;ratchet&quot; separates human culture from social learning in animals. In addition, a reliance on social learning may be responsible in part for humans&#x27; rapid adaptation to many environments outside of Africa. Since cultural universals are found in all cultures, including isolated indigenous groups, these traits must have evolved or have been invented in Africa prior to the exodus.

Archaeologically, a number of empirical traits have been used as indicators of modern human behavior. While these are often debated a few are generally agreed upon. Archaeological evidence of behavioral modernity includes:

* Burial
* Fishing
* Figurative art (cave paintings, petroglyphs, dendroglyphs, figurines)
* Use of pigments (such as ochre) and jewelry for decoration or self-ornamentation
* Using bone material for tools
* Transport of resources over long distances
* Blade technology
* Diversity, standardization, and regionally distinct artifacts
* Hearths
* Composite tools

=== Critiques ===

Several critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity, both methodologically and philosophically. Anthropologist John Shea outlines a variety of problems with this concept, arguing instead for &quot;behavioral variability&quot;, which, according to the author, better describes the archaeological record. The use of trait lists, according to Shea, runs the risk of taphonomic bias, where some sites may yield more artifacts than others despite similar populations; as well, trait lists can be ambiguous in how behaviors may be empirically recognized in the archaeological record. In particular, Shea cautions that population pressure, cultural change, or optimality models, like those in human behavioral ecology, might better predict changes in tool types or subsistence strategies than a change from &quot;archaic&quot; to &quot;modern&quot; behavior. Some researchers argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on identifying only those artifacts which are unquestionably, or purely, symbolic as a metric for modern human behavior.

Since 2018, recent dating methods utilized on various cave art sites in Spain and France have shown that Neanderthals performed symbolic artistic expression, consisting of red &quot;lines, dots, and hand stencils&quot; found in caves, prior to contact with anatomically modern humans. This is contrary to previous suggestions that Neanderthals lacked these capabilities.

== Theories and models ==
===Late Upper Paleolithic Model or &quot;Upper Paleolithic Revolution&quot;===
The Late Upper Paleolithic Model, or Upper Paleolithic Revolution, refers to the idea that, though anatomically modern humans first appear around 150,000 years ago (as was once believed), they were not cognitively or behaviorally &quot;modern&quot; until around 50,000 years ago, leading to their expansion out of Africa and into Europe and Asia. These authors note that traits used as a metric for behavioral modernity do not appear as a package until around 40–50,000 years ago. Anthropologist Richard Klein specifically describes that evidence of fishing, tools made from bone, hearths, significant artifact diversity, and elaborate graves are all absent before this point. According to both Shea and Klein, art only becomes common beyond this switching point, signifying a change from archaic to modern humans. Most researchers argue that a neurological or genetic change, perhaps one enabling complex language, such as FOXP2, caused this revolutionary change in humans. The role of FOXP2 as a driver of evolutionary selection has been called into question following recent research results.

Building on the FOXP2 gene hypothesis, cognitive scientist Philip Lieberman has argued that proto-language behaviour existed prior to 50,000 BP, albeit in a more primitive form. Lieberman has advanced fossil evidence, such as neck and throat dimensions, to demonstrate that so-called “anatomically modern” humans from 100,000 BP continued to evolve their SVT (supralaryngeal vocal tract), which already possessed a horizontal portion (SVTh) capable of producing many phonemes which were mostly consonants. According to his theory, Neanderthals and early &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; would have been able to communicate using sounds and gestures.

From 100,000 BP, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; necks continued to lengthen to a point, by around 50,000 BP, where Homo sapiens necks were long enough to accommodate a vertical portion to their SVT (SVTv), which is now a universal trait among humans. This SVTv enabled the enunciation of quantal vowels: [i]; [u]; and [a]. These quantal vowels could then be immediately put to use by the already sophisticated neuro-motor-control features of the FOXP2 gene to generate more nuanced sounds and in effect increase by orders of magnitude the number of distinct sounds that can be produced, allowing for fully symbolic language.

Goody (1986) draws an analogy between the development of spoken language and that of writing: the shift from pictographic or ideographic symbols into a fully abstract logographic writing system (such as hieroglyphics), or from a logoprahic system into an abjad or alphabet, led to dramatic changes in human civilization.

===Alternative models===
Contrasted with this view of a spontaneous leap in cognition among ancient humans, some anthropologists like Alison S. Brooks, primarily working in African archaeology, point to the gradual accumulation of &quot;modern&quot; behaviors, starting well before the 50,000-year benchmark of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution models. Howiesons Poort, Blombos, and other South African archaeological sites, for example, show evidence of marine resource acquisition, trade, the making of bone tools, blade and microlithic technology, and abstract ornamentation at least by 80,000 years ago. Given evidence from Africa and the Middle East, a variety of hypotheses have been put forth to describe an earlier, gradual transition from simple to more complex human behavior. Some authors have pushed back the appearance of fully modern behavior to around 80,000 years ago or earlier in order to incorporate the South African data.

Others focus on the slow accumulation of different technologies and behaviors across time. These researchers describe how anatomically modern humans could have been cognitively the same, and what we define as behavioral modernity is just the result of thousands of years of cultural adaptation and learning. Archaeologist Francesco d&#x27;Errico, and others, have looked at Neanderthal culture, rather than early human behavior exclusively, for clues into behavioral modernity. Noting that Neanderthal assemblages often portray traits similar to those listed for modern human behavior, researchers stress that the foundations for behavioral modernity may in fact, lie deeper in our hominin ancestors. If both modern humans and Neanderthals express abstract art and complex tools then &quot;modern human behavior&quot; cannot be a derived trait for our species. They argue that the original &quot;human revolution&quot; theory reflects a profound Eurocentric bias. Recent archaeological evidence, they argue, proves that humans evolving in Africa some 300,000 or even 400,000 years ago were already becoming cognitively and behaviourally &quot;modern&quot;. These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long-distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the &quot;human revolution&quot; model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviours in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World.

Between these extremes is the view—currently supported by archaeologists Chris Henshilwood, Curtis Marean, Ian Watts and others—that there was indeed some kind of &quot;human revolution&quot; but that it occurred in Africa and spanned tens of thousands of years. The term &quot;revolution,&quot; in this context, would mean not a sudden mutation but a historical development along the lines of the industrial revolution or the Neolithic revolution. In other words, it was a relatively accelerated process, too rapid for ordinary Darwinian &quot;descent with modification&quot; yet too gradual to be attributed to a single genetic or other sudden event. These archaeologists point in particular to the relatively explosive emergence of ochre crayons and shell necklaces, apparently used for cosmetic purposes. These archaeologists see symbolic organisation of human social life as the key transition in modern human evolution. Recently discovered at sites such as Blombos Cave and Pinnacle Point, South Africa, pierced shells, pigments and other striking signs of personal ornamentation have been dated within a time-window of 70,000–160,000 years ago in the African Middle Stone Age, suggesting that the emergence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; coincided, after all, with the transition to modern cognition and behaviour. While viewing the emergence of language as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; development, this school of thought generally attributes it to cumulative social, cognitive and cultural evolutionary processes as opposed to a single genetic mutation.

A further view, taken by archaeologists such as Francesco d&#x27;Errico and João Zilhão, is a multi-species perspective arguing that evidence for symbolic culture, in the form of utilised pigments and pierced shells, are also found in Neanderthal sites, independently of any &quot;modern&quot; human influence.

Cultural evolutionary models may also shed light on why although evidence of behavioral modernity exists before 50,000 years ago, it is not expressed consistently until that point. With small population sizes, human groups would have been affected by demographic and cultural evolutionary forces that may not have allowed for complex cultural traits. According to some authors, until population density became significantly high, complex traits could not have been maintained effectively. Some genetic evidence supports a dramatic increase in population size before human migration out of Africa. High local extinction rates within a population also can significantly decrease the amount of diversity in neutral cultural traits, regardless of cognitive ability.

== Archaeological evidence ==

=== Africa ===
Research from 2017 indicates that &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; originated in Africa between around 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. There is some evidence for the beginning of modern behavior among early African &quot;H. sapiens&quot; around that period.

Before the Out of Africa theory was generally accepted, there was no consensus on where the human species evolved and, consequently, where modern human behavior arose. Now, however, African archaeology has become extremely important in discovering the origins of humanity. The first Cro-Magnon expansion into Europe around 48,000 years ago is generally accepted as already &quot;modern&quot;, and it is now generally believed that behavioral modernity appeared in Africa before 50,000 years ago, either significantly earlier, or possibly as a late Upper Paleolithic &quot;revolution&quot; soon before which prompted migration out of Africa.

A variety of evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other &quot;modern&quot; behaviors have been discovered in Africa, especially South, North, and East Africa. The Blombos Cave site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of ochre engraved with geometric designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was dated to be around 77,000 and 100,000 to 75,000 years old. Ostrich egg shell containers engraved with geometric designs dating to 60,000 years ago were found at Diepkloof, South Africa. Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads dating from significantly prior to 50,000 years ago, and shell beads dating to about 75,000 years ago have been found at Blombos Cave, South Africa.

Specialized projectile weapons as well have been found at various sites in Middle Stone Age Africa, including bone and stone arrowheads at South African sites such as Sibudu Cave (along with an early bone needle also found at Sibudu) dating approximately 72,000–60,000 years ago on some of which poisons may have been used, and bone harpoons at the Central African site of Katanda dating to about 90,000 years ago. Evidence also exists for the systematic heat treating of silcrete stone to increase its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking, beginning approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point and becoming common there for the creation of microlithic tools at about 72,000 years ago.

In 2008, an ochre processing workshop likely for the production of paints was uncovered dating to c. 100,000 years ago at Blombos Cave, South Africa. Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the two abalone shells, and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones, and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the toolkits. Evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources (implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow), possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone, using a probable recipe to produce the compound, and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use. Modern behaviors, such as the making of shell beads, bone tools and arrows, and the use of ochre pigment, are evident at a Kenyan site by 78,000–67,000 years ago. Evidence of early stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, and date to around 279,000 years ago.

Expanding subsistence strategies beyond big-game hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity. A number of South African sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish. Pinnacle Point, in particular, shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000 years ago, perhaps in response to more arid conditions inland. Establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits, for example, could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior. Blombos Cave and Site 440 in Sudan both show evidence of fishing as well. Taphonomic change in fish skeletons from Blombos Cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish, clearly an intentional human behavior.

Humans in North Africa (Nazlet Sabaha, Egypt) are known to have dabbled in chert mining, as early as ≈100,000 years ago, for the construction of stone tools.

Evidence was found in 2018, dating to about 320,000 years ago, at the Kenyan site of Olorgesailie, of the early emergence of modern behaviors including: long-distance trade networks (involving goods such as obsidian), the use of pigments, and the possible making of projectile points. It is observed by the authors of three 2018 studies on the site that the evidence of these behaviors is approximately contemporary to the earliest known &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossil remains from Africa (such as at Jebel Irhoud and Florisbad), and they suggest that complex and modern behaviors had already begun in Africa around the time of the emergence of anatomically modern &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;.

In 2019, further evidence of early complex projectile weapons in Africa was found at Aduma, Ethiopia, dated 100,000–80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.

=== Europe ===
While traditionally described as evidence for the later Upper Paleolithic Model, European archaeology has shown that the issue is more complex. A variety of stone tool technologies are present at the time of human expansion into Europe and show evidence of modern behavior. Despite the problems of conflating specific tools with cultural groups, the Aurignacian tool complex, for example, is generally taken as a purely modern human signature. The discovery of &quot;transitional&quot; complexes, like &quot;proto-Aurignacian&quot;, have been taken as evidence of human groups progressing through &quot;steps of innovation&quot;. If, as this might suggest, human groups were already migrating into eastern Europe around 40,000 years and only afterward show evidence of behavioral modernity, then either the cognitive change must have diffused back into Africa or was already present before migration.

In light of a growing body of evidence of Neanderthal culture and tool complexes some researchers have put forth a &quot;multiple species model&quot; for behavioral modernity. Neanderthals were often cited as being an evolutionary dead-end, apish cousins who were less advanced than their human contemporaries. Personal ornaments were relegated as trinkets or poor imitations compared to the cave art produced by &quot;H. sapiens&quot;. Despite this, European evidence has shown a variety of personal ornaments and artistic artifacts produced by Neanderthals; for example, the Neanderthal site of Grotte du Renne has produced grooved bear, wolf, and fox incisors, ochre and other symbolic artifacts. Although few and controversial, circumstantial evidence of Neanderthal ritual burials has been uncovered. There are two options to describe this symbolic behavior among Neanderthals: they copied cultural traits from arriving modern humans or they had their own cultural traditions comparative with behavioral modernity. If they just copied cultural traditions, which is debated by several authors, they still possessed the capacity for complex culture described by behavioral modernity. As discussed above, if Neanderthals also were &quot;behaviorally modern&quot; then it cannot be a species-specific derived trait.

=== Asia ===
Most debates surrounding behavioral modernity have been focused on Africa or Europe but an increasing amount of focus has been placed on East Asia. This region offers a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of multi-regionalism, replacement, and demographic effects. Unlike Europe, where initial migration occurred around 50,000 years ago, human remains have been dated in China to around 100,000 years ago. This early evidence of human expansion calls into question behavioral modernity as an impetus for migration.

Stone tool technology is particularly of interest in East Asia. Following &quot;Homo erectus&quot; migrations out of Africa, Acheulean technology never seems to appear beyond present-day India and into China. Analogously, Mode 3, or Levallois technology, is not apparent in China following later hominin dispersals. This lack of more advanced technology has been explained by serial founder effects and low population densities out of Africa. Although tool complexes comparative to Europe are missing or fragmentary, other archaeological evidence shows behavioral modernity. For example, the peopling of the Japanese archipelago offers an opportunity to investigate the early use of watercraft. Although one site, Kanedori in Honshu, does suggest the use of watercraft as early as 84,000 years ago, there is no other evidence of hominins in Japan until 50,000 years ago.

The Zhoukoudian cave system near Beijing has been excavated since the 1930s and has yielded precious data on early human behavior in East Asia. Although disputed, there is evidence of possible human burials and interred remains in the cave dated to around 34–20,000 years ago. These remains have associated personal ornaments in the form of beads and worked shell, suggesting symbolic behavior. Along with possible burials, numerous other symbolic objects like punctured animal teeth and beads, some dyed in red ochre, have all been found at Zhoukoudian. Although fragmentary, the archaeological record of eastern Asia shows evidence of behavioral modernity before 50,000 years ago but, like the African record, it is not fully apparent until that time.

<text>Montenegro Airlines a.d. () was the flag carrier of Montenegro, headquartered in Podgorica. It operated scheduled and charter services throughout Europe from its hub at Podgorica Airport with a second base maintained at Tivat Airport. The airline was liquidated from 26 December 2020 due to accumulating heavy losses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2021, the government of Montenegro launched a new flag carrier, Air Montenegro.

==History==
===Master Airways===

The airline was founded on 24 October 1994, by the government of the Montenegro as Montenegro Airlines. The first aircraft, a Fokker 28 Mk4000 (nicknamed &quot;Lovćen&quot;), was purchased almost two years later in 1996. The first commercial flight took place on 7 May 1997, at exactly 10:30 between Podgorica and Bari, Italy.

In April 2000, the company became member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In June 2000, the first of five Fokker 100 aircraft were delivered to the company at Podgorica Airport. The airline joined Amadeus CRS on 5 March 2003. In 2004, Master Airways pilots were the first in the region to be granted the IIIA certificate. On 2 July of the same year, the airline carried its millionth passenger.

After the Montenegrin independence referendum, Serbia became an international market for Montenegrin companies. Montenegro Airlines had to cease international flights from Serbia to countries other than Montenegro, thus losing the profitable Niš - Zurich line, due to lack of Seventh Freedom policy. In an effort to circumvent this, Montenegro Airlines tried to re-register as a separate airline in Serbia returning its name to Master Airways, but it was denied an operating license allegedly due to Serbian Government protectionist policies.
On 23 July 2007, Montenegro Airlines ordered 2 Embraer 195 in order to grow its fleet and destination network. The aircraft being leased from GECAS for a period of 8 years. The first of the two Embraer E-195s arrived at Podgorica Airport on 5 June 2008. The delivery of the first Embraer was followed by introduction of regular flights to London-Gatwick and Milan-Malpensa International Airport.

On 17 April 2009, El Al and Montenegro Airlines issued a joint statement reiterating El Al&#x27;s keen interest in buying 30% of the stock, but the plan failed. The airline remains a government-owned company and enjoys financial and protectionist support from the government.
===Development since 2010===
After the arrival of the airline&#x27;s first pair of Embraer E-195s, Montenegro Airlines requested Embraer to change the remaining backlog order to the E-175. However, the third E-195 was delivered anyway, and thus the fourth remaining order was to be an E-175. On 6 July 2012, local media cited that Montenegro Airlines has yet again changed the fourth order, this time requesting an E-190LR model. The aircraft was delivered in May 2014. In November 2014, Montenegro Airlines put both its Fokker 100s up for sale. However, by June 2015 no buyer has been found and the aircraft are likely to be scrapped.

===Liquidation and the new company===
In August 2016, it was reported that accounts belonging to Montenegro Airlines had been frozen after the airline failed to comply with a court ruling regarding the payment of debts to the operator of the country&#x27;s airports. Montenegro Airlines owed the company more than US$15 million.

In December 2020, the Government of Montenegro announced the shutdown and liquidation of the company in the forthcoming weeks stating mismanagement and accumulating losses for several years. Shortly after, it has been announced that the airline will suspend all flights from 26 December 2020 marking the end of its operations.

On 29 December 2020, it was announced by Minister Mladen Bojanić that the Montenegro Airlines would be reorganized and replaced with a new company the To Montenegro (2 Montenegro), as the new Montenegrin flag carrier airline.

In late 2020 it was uncovered that a number of individuals close to the ruling DPS party, such as controversial religious leader Miraš Dedeić, were given free tickets or significant discount for the flights of the Montenegro Airlines.

In April 2021, it was reported the Montenegrin government made &quot; Air Montenegro&quot; the official name for the ToMontenegro project and that the airline would start up using two of Montenegro Airlines&#x27; former Embraer-195 aircraft.

In June 2021, Montenegro Airlines&#x27; former directors, pilots, flight crew and other employees reported to the Bankruptcy Administration claims of US$205 million for salaries, taxes, contributions, per diems and fees.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 25 January 2005 at about 11 p.m., a Montenegro Airlines Fokker 100 (YU-AOM) ran off the side of the runway during a night landing in snowy conditions at Podgorica. The nosegear collapsed and the airplane skidded for about 700 meters before coming to rest. Two passengers, the pilot, and the co-pilot sustained minor injuries.
*On 7 January 2008, at about 9:30 pm, a Montenegro Airlines Fokker 100 (4O-AOK) was shot at while landing at Podgorica Airport. A routine inspection of the aircraft led to the discovery of a bullet hole in the aircraft&#x27;s tail. The aircraft was carrying 20 passengers, but no one was injured. The reason for the incident is unknown; however, reports indicate that it may have been an inadvertent result of guns being fired during celebrations for Orthodox Christmas.

<doc id="569097" wikidata="Q3778684" url="?curid=569097" title="Melbourne gangland killings">
<text>The Melbourne gangland killings were the murders of 36 underworld figures in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, between January 1998 and August 2010. The murders were retributive killings involving underworld groups. The deaths caused a power vacuum within Melbourne&#x27;s criminal community, and rival factions fought for control and influence. Many of the murders remain unsolved, although detectives from the Purana Taskforce believe that Carl Williams was responsible for at least ten of them. The period culminated in the arrest of Williams, who pleaded guilty on 28 February 2007 to three of the murders.

Since the confession of Williams, the ultimate source of the violence has become public knowledge. On his 29th birthday, while meeting with Jason Moran and his half brother Mark Moran on 13 October 1999 at a suburban park in Gladstone Park, Jason Moran shot Carl Williams in the stomach over a dispute about money relating to their amphetamine trade. Through the period after his run-in with the Moran family, Williams commenced a war with the aim of killing all members of the ‘Carlton Crew’.

The murder of former lawyer Mario Condello on 6 February 2006 caused speculation of a possible resurgence in the killings, although this was denied by police.

On 19 April 2010, Carl Williams was murdered by fellow inmate Matthew Johnson while incarcerated at Barwon Prison. Williams would have been 71 before becoming eligible for parole.

== Background ==

The majority of underworld crime figures and major incidents can be traced back to the Painters and Dockers Union that existed on Melbourne&#x27;s waterfront after the Second World War. The Union had a Mafia-like structure, and most criminal activity was centred around control of the Union, and the cut associated with the drugs (primarily heroin and cocaine) that passed through the port. The Melbourne Markets was used as a distribution point for the illegal drugs, because of its close proximity to the docks.

By 1990 the local manufacture of amphetamines had increased to the point where the police described Melbourne as the &quot;amphetamine capital of Australia&quot;. As well as drug dealing, criminals received income through protection rackets in King Street nightclubs, as well as in prostitution, illegal gambling, and armed robbery.

The genesis of the underworld conflict can be traced to the 1996 arrest of John Higgs, then Australia&#x27;s number one trafficker of amphetamines. Higgs was a well-connected criminal with a wide network of contacts both in the underworld and among corrupt police, and it took several years in one of the country&#x27;s most expensive criminal investigations to finally convict him of drug trafficking charges. The case was controversial and included a major cache of drugs linked to Higgs and his syndicate mysteriously vanishing in the storage depots of Melbourne&#x27;s drug squad, almost certainly thanks to corrupt police involvement. The downfall of Higgs and his closest associates meant younger criminals became keen to enter the drug trade and fill the vacuum left by Higgs&#x27; arrest. This included underworld figures such as Jason Moran and Carl Williams who would become key figures in the Melbourne gangland killings.

The catalyst that ignited the conflict was the 1998 murders of Melbourne gangsters Alphonse Gangitano, shot dead in his own home on 16 January 1998, and Charles Hegyalji known as &quot;Mad Charlie&quot;, murdered in front of his house on 23 November of that same year. Both Gangitano and Hegyalji had been major figures in the Melbourne underworld, and Gangitano in particular had been a close ally of Higgs. Following these two deaths many of Gangitano and Hegyalji&#x27;s former associates suddenly rose to positions of importance in the underworld, and it was several of these figures, such as Vince Mannella and Dimitrios Belias, who became the next victims in Melbourne&#x27;s underworld war as the fight for power escalated. The conflict was further exacerbated by the 1999 shooting of Carl Williams, who was shot in the stomach by the Moran brothers, Jason and Mark, over a drug-related debt. Williams, who survived the shooting, vowed to exterminate the Moran family and in doing so became the most infamous criminal involved in the killings, as he arranged the murders of most of the Moran family and several of their allies in the Carlton Crew.

=== Groups and factions ===
The following groups of people were connected to the murders. A number of those named below were members of more than one group at the same time.

;The Honoured Society
:A Calabrian &#x27;Ndrangheta group that has long been linked with control of Melbourne&#x27;s fruit and vegetable markets.

;The Painters and Dockers / Moran family
:A loose association of Irish waterfront workers and ex-members of the Painters and Dockers Union. Brian, Les &amp; Ray Kane, Graham Kinniburgh, Victor Peirce, and Lewis, Mark, and Jason Moran were all associated with &#x27;the Dockers&#x27;. The Moran family operated jointly with the mostly Italian Carlton Crew.

;The Carlton Crew
:An independent ’Ndrangheta group created by Alphonse Gangitano. Domenic &quot;Mick&quot; Gatto and Mario Condello were also members. Gatto succeeded Gangitano as leader of the organization after the latter&#x27;s death in 1998.

;Radev Gang
:Led by Nikolai &quot;The Russian&quot; Radev, a convicted drug dealer and career criminal who was shot in Queen Street, Coburg in 2003. No killer has been formally identified, although several possibles have been named.

;The Sunshine Crew
:Led by Paul &quot;PK&quot; Kallipolitis. Dino Dibra, Andrew &quot;Benji&quot; Veniamin, Rocco Arico, Mark Mallia, Bluey Watkins, Johnny Auciello, Mark Morrison, Michael Dewhirst, Terrence Chimmiri and Jason Kontek were also known associates. All had been friends since childhood. Veniamin took over the group after Kallipolitis was murdered; Veniamin was himself assassinated in 2004.
;The Williams Family
:Led by Carl Williams, and his father, George Williams. Antonios Mokbel, Andrew Veniamin, and Dino Dibra were known associates.

==Investigation==
The Purana Task Force was established by Victoria Chief Commissioner of Police Christine Nixon in 2003 to investigate the Melbourne gangland killings and major drug syndicates. The taskforce enjoyed success in investigating and halting the killings, despite initially being pushed for staff. In 2008, following the halt in killings, the purview of the task force was expanded.

Investigations were initially hampered by a &quot;code of silence&quot;, with few organised crime figures willing to risk their lives to provide details to state and federal authorities but they were able to cultivate informers and protected witnesses from within the criminal community although Victoria&#x27;s state police have lamented the death of gang figures who were killed before they were able to aid their investigation. The use of one of those informers, barrister Nicola Gobbo, led to multiple court cases including the High Court of Australia decision AB v CD, a Royal Commission and placing hundreds of convictions in doubt. 

During the existence of the Purana taskforce it was led by a number of different officers including:
* Jim O’Brien
* Andrew Gustke

In the first three years of the Purana taskforce
*316 people were investigated
*6000 hours of recordings were made from 328,000 telephone conversations
*39 tracking devices were used which helped the taskforce spend 22,000 hours following suspects
These efforts helped taskforce Purana which was praised for their efforts to stop the killings.

Detective Inspector Andrew Gustke was head of the taskforce in 2016 and stated that if groups like Purana were successful then there would be a reduction in the level of general crime. At the same time it was announced that they would begin investigating firearms trafficking which had caused an increase in shootings in Melbourne. Gustke also wanted international taskforces to be set up to stop drug trafficking before it reaches Australia.

In 2019 it was revealed that, in 2006, Purana detectives hid from the court the fact that they paid money into the prison account of a crown witness. The Court of Appeal ruled this to be a miscarriage of justice and quashed the conviction.

The Purana taskforce was closed after a 2021 review found that the taskforce had achieved what it was set up to do, but a change was required to enable detectives to respond more quickly to changing threats, with a spokesperson saying that whilst &quot;highly successful during this time, the criminal landscape has changed significantly since its inception, which is why we have recommended the operation closes&quot;. Whilst the taskforce was in operation it was responsible for the laying of charges in 15 murders with 11 convictions, as well as intervening to prevent six murders. It also seized $70 million in assets information and assisted the Australian Tax Office in issuing around 1000 tax demand notices which recouped more than $15 million.

==Timeline of events==

===1995===
*7 February 1995 – Greg Workman shot dead by Alphonse Gangitano over a $50,000 debt in Wando Grove, St Kilda.

===1996===
*15 August 1996 – Tim Richards and Les Knowles, two mechanics who also dealt in drugs, were shot dead in their auto-shop by Gerald David Preston. A third mechanic, Kym Traeger, was wounded but survived. The killing was related to drugs and is believed to have been ordered by the Hell&#x27;s Angel outlaw motorcycle club, of which Preston was an associate. Preston was convicted in 1998 and given a life sentence with a 32-year non-parole period, and the driver for the murder, Kevin Wayne Gillard, was also given a life sentence.

===1997===
*20 April 1997 – George Marcus was shot six times in Box Hill North, as he was visiting his partner&#x27;s home. Marcus, suspected of running a massive counterfeit ring, was involved in foreign business deals in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, and was connected to the Chaouk crime family in Melbourne. Marcus was shot dead by two gunmen in front of the house&#x27;s garage, and the killers then sped away in a late-model Commodore or Ford. Police found fake cheques worth between $30,000 and $250,000 in Marcus&#x27;s briefcase, for a total of more than $16,650,000. Marcus was also suspected of being an informant for the Australian Federal Police. In his books, Chopper Read alleged police involvement in the murder of George Marcus.

===1998===
*16 January 1998 – The Melbourne gangland killings are believed to have begun with the murder of 40-year-old Alphonse Gangitano. He was shot and killed in the laundry of his own home, while wearing only his underwear. A coroner&#x27;s report into his death directly implicated Jason Moran and Graham Kinniburgh. They were both found to be in Gangitano&#x27;s home in Templestowe when the murder took place; however, it could not be established who pulled the trigger. Kinniburgh&#x27;s blood was found on a banister inside the house, and his skin was found on a dent on the front security door. Both were excused from giving evidence to the coroner on the grounds they might incriminate themselves. It is widely believed that Jason Moran was the one who shot Gangitano.
*3 August 1998 – John Furlan, a 48-year-old motor mechanic from Coburg, was killed by a car bomb in his Subaru Liberty in Lorensen Avenue, Merlynston. Domenic &quot;Mick&quot; Gatto was initially treated as a suspect since he had been involved in a payment dispute with the deceased; however, no one has been arrested in connection with his death.
*23 November 1998 – 42-year-old stand-over man Charles Hegyalji, known as &quot;Mad Charlie&quot;, was killed at his Caulfield home. He was an acquaintance of Chopper Read and had been associated with the amphetamine industry.

===1999===
*9 January 1999 – Vince Mannella, a former associate of Victor Peirce and Alphonse Gangitano, was ambushed and killed outside his home in North Fitzroy in the evening. Media suspected his death was debt-related or part of an underworld power struggle but no suspects were ever named.
*21 February 1999 – Phong Dui Nguyen, a heroin dealer, was shot six times with a .357 magnum as he exited his car on Gray Street, Yarraville. The gunman was Tom Scarborough, a major Melbourne heroin trafficker.
*24 February 1999 – Damian Catania was the victim of a drive-by shooting at about 6.00 am. Catania was waiting outside his home in Hoppers Crossing in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs for a regular lift to work when a white Holden Commodore slowed as it cruised by. A gunman in the car, (suspected to be Andrew Veniamin) opened fire, hitting Catania at least four times in the legs and groin. Catania, a mid-level &quot;player&quot; in the underworld was an ex-boxer who had a string of minor convictions, mostly for violence. Catania almost lost a leg as a result of the shooting and spent 12 months in hospital recovering. Those in the car were never caught. On Monday 22 May 2006 Catania, then 30, was sentenced to a minimum of six years jail for pouring petrol over a man who had annoyed him and setting the victim alight, causing horrific burns. Catania told the court that on his eventual release from jail, he wanted to &quot;pack up and travel out of Melbourne&quot;.
*28 May 1999 – Joseph Quadara, a 57-year-old greengrocer, was ambushed by two people and killed in a Toorak carpark in the early hours as he was about to start work at a Safeway supermarket. The former millionaire was declared bankrupt in 1994. Police believed that his killing was a horrible case of mistaken identity, due to the existence of another Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Quadara involved in Melbourne&#x27;s fruit and vegetable industry with underworld connections, although Joe himself had connections to the Melbourne&#x27;s fruit and vegetable markets and it is conspired that the Markets God-Father; Frank Benevenuto hired Andrew &quot;Benji&quot; Veniamin to perform the hit.
*12 June 1999 - Vicki Jacobs who previously testified against her husband Gerald David Preston in the murder of Tim Richards and Les Knowles was shot dead in her home.
*9 September 1999 – 38-year-old Brighton businessman Dimitrios Belias was killed with a single shot to the back of the head in an underground carpark on St Kilda road. He had been an associate of Charles Hegyalji and was believed to be heavily in debt. In 2002, a coroner reported that Belias had been trying to use fake diamonds to clear his underworld debts. Police have posted a $100,000 reward for information leading to apprehending Belias&#x27;s killers. On 22 December 2011, Michael John Henderson was sentenced to 7 and a half years in prison for having stolen more than a million dollars through a fraud scheme, in an effort to help settle the debt owed by Belias prior to his murder.
*14 September 1999 – 47-year-old criminal Milorad Dapcevic, a friend and business associate of Belias, was last seen alive on the night that he made a statement in the police station at St Kilda Road. He had prior criminal convictions for armed robbery and was suspected to be involved in heroin trafficking prior to his disappearance. He has never been found, and as of 2014 police investigators believed he had been murdered, possibly by the same people that killed Dimitrios Belias.
*13 October 1999 – Drug dealer Carl Williams, who was 29 at the time, was shot in the stomach and survived in Gladstone Park. Williams told the police he blacked out and could not identify the shooter. Known underworld figures Mark and Jason Moran were present at the time, and police believe there was a dispute related to a failed amphetamines batch and ownership of a pill press. A woman told police she heard a man cry &quot;No, Jason!&quot; moments before a shot was fired.
*20 October 1999 – Vince Mannella&#x27;s brother, 31-year-old Gerardo Mannella, was ambushed and killed outside his brother&#x27;s home, after attempting to flee from two men. The killers of Mannella are also believed to have shot his brother Vince as well as Dimirtrios Belias.
*25 November 1999 – George and Carl Williams were charged with multiple drug offences after police raided an alleged amphetamine factory in Broadmeadows. Police seized around 25,000 amphetamine tablets, a pill press, a loaded pistol and 6.95 kg of powders containing methamphetamine, ketamine, and pseudoephedrine with a street value up to A$20 million. These charges were never brought to trial because of corruption allegations against former drug squad detectives involved in the raid.

===2000–2002===
*8 May 2000 – 52-year-old fruiterer Francesco &quot;Frank&quot; Benvenuto, was fatally shot while sitting in his car in the driveway of his Beaumaris home. Benvenuto was a major underworld figure in Melbourne and the son of Liborio Benvenuto (died 1988), considered to be at one time the &quot;Godfather&quot; of the city&#x27;s mafia. Phone records show that as Benvenuto lay dying he managed to ring ex-employee and associate Victor Peirce on his mobile phone. Mick Gatto was suspected by some to have ordered the assassination, whereas others suggested the murder could be retribution for the death of Alfonso Muratore, a high ranking Mafia member shot dead on 4 August 1992. Police initially treated Gatto as a suspect but later offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Mark Moran and Andrew Veniamin were later named as chief suspects.
*16 May 2000 – Richard Mladenich, a 39-year-old parolee, career criminal, and associate of Mark Moran, was killed with a single bullet in the St Kilda Esquire Hotel. He had recently been released from jail where he once shared a cell with Chopper Read. Police named Rocco Arico as a suspect but were unable to interview him whilst he was in prison. They later named Dino Dibra as their primary suspect Mark Moran was also named as a suspect. It has also been reported that Carl Williams was the getaway driver.
*15 June 2000 – Mark Moran (then 35 years old) was shot and killed by Carl Williams as he was getting out of his white Holden Ute outside his luxury home in Aberfeldie. Moran&#x27;s murder was initially thought of as retribution for the death of Frank Benvenuto. Some underworld rumours suspected Rodney &quot;The Duke&quot; Collins as one of his killers. Dino Dibra and Rocco Arico were also thought to have carried out the killing. Mark Moran had been under close police surveillance but the surveillance was mysteriously switched off hours before he was shot dead.
*14 October 2000 – Dino Dibra (25) was killed after leaving his house in West Sunshine. At the time he was facing charges relating to kidnap and assault. At a police press conference, Detective Inspector Andrew Allen said &quot;We are confident that this gunman is a hired hitman and that he, along with another person, ambushed Mr Dibra that night about 9:16 pm and shot him a number of times ... this is not the only murder (the gunman) has committed&quot;. This police profile strongly suggested that &#x27;Benji&#x27; Veniamin was one of the gunmen. A $100 000 reward was offered by police for information.
*22 March 2001 – 41 year-old George Germanos, a part-time security guard and nightclub bouncer was found with three bullets in his head and one in his chest at an Armadale park. Germanos had been fearing for his life, and only two weeks prior to his murder he had tried to borrow $5000 from a relative in order to purchase a handgun. It is stated that the reason for his killing had to do with an incident where he bashed Ray Mather, son of prominent underworld figure Robert &quot;Bluey Bob&quot; Mather, at a St Kilda nightclub on October 21, 2000. Robert Mather and his gang were believed to be involved in a series of vicious armed robberies as well as considered suspects in the shooting of Dimitrios Belias in 1999, and the murder of Maryanna Lanciana, wife of convicted bank robber Pasquale &#x27;Percy&#x27; Lanciana, who was shot dead in her home in 1984. Robert Mather remained a person of interest to police for the three murders but he died of natural causes in 2014.
*1 May 2002 – 43-year-old Victor Peirce was killed while in a car parked opposite the Coles supermarket in Bay Street, Port Melbourne. A white Holden Commodore pulled up beside Peirce, who exchanged words with the occupants inside the car before being shot four times at close range. Although Pierce was officially employed as a waterfront worker, police believed he was the leader of various drug syndicates in Melbourne and heavily involved with drug trafficking. Peirce was considered a true underworld heavy-weight; he was born into the notorious Pettingill family. It is suspected that this contract killing was organized by Mick Gatto and Vince Benvenuto and executed by Andrew Veniamin; Faruk Orman was initially convicted of the murder, but was acquitted in 2019.
*10 July 2002 – Alexander Kudryavstev was shot by Michael Goldman. Goldman, 55, said he shot to miss a wounded acquaintance on a suburban nature strip despite orders from psychotic criminal, Nik Radev to &quot;finish him&quot;. Goldman said he was &quot;under the gun&quot; and terrified of Radev. Goldman lured Kudryavstev to his Hampton flat and told a Supreme Court jury he was acting like a robot when he shot Kudryavstev in the stomach at the flat. He said Radev told him earlier the same day: &quot;Give him one in the head and I take care of the body.&quot; Goldman, of Highett Road, plead not guilty to the attempted murder of Kudryavstev. The jury heard Kudryavstev, a police informer, was wearing a concealed tape recorder when shot in the abdomen and in the head. He secretly recorded his terrifying brush with death. Goldman shot Kudryavstev in the abdomen as he greeted him at the front door. Kudryavstev said he moved his head when Goldman fired at him on a nature strip near Highett Road. Goldman denied during cross-examination that he knew at the time Kudryavstev was a police informer. He said an angry Radev wanted to meet Mr Kudryavstev over a burglary at a friend&#x27;s warehouse. On 27 May 2004, Goldman was jailed for 14 years. Supreme Court judge Justice Robert Redlich ordered Goldman to serve a minimum non-parole term of 11 years. &quot;Your anger and desire to kill him (Mr Kudryavstev) is evident on listening to the tape recording,&quot; said the judge.
*16 October 2002 – 31 year old drug dealer Paul Kallipolitis was shot dead in his West Sunshine home. He was lying on his bed and had one gunshot wound to the head. Police publicly suspected that his friend Andrew Veniamin was the killer. Veniamin and Kallipolitis had been friends for many years, since they were kids. Kallipolitis shot and killed a man in Deer Park almost a decade earlier after having a gun pulled on him. Angelo Mario Venditti was arrested for this murder on 29 July 2008.
*28 December 2002 – At approximately 8.30 AM, while under police surveillance, Mark Anthony Smith, returned to his home after dropping his daughter off at work. Smith parked the car, and as he was getting out was shot in the neck and hand in the driveway of his Keilor home. Recognizing the gunmen, Smith sprinted after the shooter, Victor Brincat, but upon realising he was losing a lot of blood, turned back to wait for medical assistance. A convicted murderer, he had been sentenced to 13 years in prison for the murder of a man, John Anset, who was undertaking community service at the local high school in Craigieburn during 1987. Rumours surfaced that the hit against Smith was ordered after he accepted the job to kill Jason Moran. But instead of shooting Jason, he went halves in the cash with Moran. Victor Brincat, after turning on his crew and becoming an informant, revealed that Carl Williams had ordered the killing and had not paid him for the hits that had already taken place. Smith survived the assassination attempt, subsequently moving his family to Queensland and away from the violence before returning to Melbourne.

===2003===
*15 April 2003 – 44-year-old Nik Radev, known as &quot;The Bulgarian&quot; (alternately reported as &quot;The Russian&quot; by media outlets, though he was never known by this name. This is suspected to be due to Russia&#x27;s known links to underworld figures.), was killed in Queen Street Coburg. The known drug dealer and standover man was shot seven times in the head and chest as he sat in his Mercedes-Benz coupé. Victoria Police told &quot;The Age&quot; that they believed his death was planned by a father and son drug manufacturing team, and a hitman suspected of four other murders carried out the killing in a red sedan. Andrew Veniamin met Radev on the day of the murder and unambiguously fitted the police description of the prime suspect, along with George and Carl Williams. Radev had been warned that he was a marked man but ignored the warnings refusing to believe his friends would turn on him. Damien Cossu and Alfonso Traglia were with Radev at the time of the murder but claimed they could not identify the gunman, and were subsequently named by police as &#x27;persons of interest&#x27;
*June 2003 – Taskforce Purana was set up by Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Simon Overland to investigate Melbourne&#x27;s underworld.
*4 June 2003 – 28-year-old male prostitute Shane Chartres-Abbott was fatally shot outside his Reservoir home on his way to a County Court trial for raping and bashing a female client in 2002. In 2007, underworld assassin Keith Faure (known as JP) confessed to this murder and said two corrupt detectives were linked to the murder. The murder sparked a media frenzy. The Briars Task Force was formed to investigate the murder.
*21 June 2003 – 35-year-old Jason Moran, and his minder, 40-year-old Pasquale Barbaro were fatally shot as they sat in a parked blue van outside an &quot;Auskick&quot; football clinic in Essendon. Five children were witness to the murder including Moran&#x27;s six-year-old twin boy and girl. The gunman Victor Brincat ran away across the football oval and over a Moonee Ponds Creek footbridge to a waiting vehicle containing Thomas Hentschel.
*21 July 2003 – 39-year-old major drug dealer Willie Thompson was killed while sitting in his car after leaving a mixed martial arts club in Chadstone. He had been a close associate of the Moran family. Police say the gunman strolled up to the car and shot Thompson dead before escaping with a second person in a stolen Ford sedan. Some bullets were lodged in nearby shops. Thompson&#x27;s official occupation was a lollipop vendor inside nightclubs, and a police report said he had recently developed an enmity with Nik Radev. In many rumours Hizir Ferman and Robert Musso are thought to have done this shooting. According to criminals turned testifying witnesses, Carl Williams ordered the death of Thompson to steal a large quantity of drug chemicals from him.
*18 August 2003 – 36-year-old Mark Mallia&#x27;s burnt body was found in a suburban storm drain packed inside a green wheelie-bin. Before his murder, Mallia was kidnapped by drug-boss Carl Williams and a team of 7 men (including Benji Veniamin, Damien Cossu, Chris Orfandis, Hizir Ferman and Alfonso Traglia), the 7 men took Mallia back to a warehouse where they tortured him into confessing where some laundered money was buried. Little details are known if the torture was successful or not, but not long after Mark Mallia was murdered.
*9 September 2003 – 32-year-old Housom Zayat was run off the road, forced from his car and repeatedly shot in the head before being found in a paddock in Tarneit with multiple bullet wounds. Zayat was also a close associate of Nik Radev. Nicholas Ibrahim charged with his murder.
*20 October 2003 – 49-year-old Istvan &quot;Steve&quot; Gulyas and his de facto wife were found executed in their Sunbury home. Together they ran a dating agency, &quot;Partner Search Australia&quot;, which police suspected was a front for a brothel. Gulyas was also a friend of Nik Radev.
*25 October 2003 – 38-year-old Michael Ronald Marshall was shot four times in the head outside his luxury South Yarra home in front of his five-year-old son. He was a hot-dog salesman but also sold ecstasy at the street level. He had been suspected by some, including major crime lord Tony Mokbel, of being the one responsible for Willie Thompson&#x27;s death. Carl Williams, eager to frame Marshall for the Thompson killing, ordered his murder. Victor Brincat and Thomas Hentschel were convicted of killing Michael Marshall. The killing became controversial as Brincat and Hentschel had actually been closely followed and monitored by police, who however at the last minute could not or would not prevent Marshall&#x27;s murder.
*17 November 2003 – Carl Williams was arrested and charged with making threats to kill a Purana Taskforce detective and the investigator&#x27;s girlfriend. The alleged threats were made in a taped phone conversation to Victor Brincat in Barwon Prison. Carl was bailed two weeks later. The arrest was dramatically captured on film by &quot;The Age&quot; photographer Angela Wylie.
*13 December 2003 – 61-year-old Graham Kinniburgh, known as &quot;The Munster&quot;, was ambushed and shot outside his home in Kew just after midnight. Police said he had been killed in front of family members soon after parking his car. Kinniburgh was carrying a gun and managed to return one shot before being killed. He was considered Melbourne&#x27;s most influential criminal at the time of his death. Kinniburgh was also a ring leader in the notorious Drill-bit gang that specialised in safe breaking. Mick Gatto was a pallbearer at his funeral, Lewis Moran and many other underworld figures also attended. Andrew Veniamin was treated as a suspect in his murder, and Carl Williams was also questioned. Stephen John Asling was charged with The Munster&#x27;s murder in 2015.

===2004===
*February 2004 – Carl Williams went on the record with the news magazine &quot;The Bulletin&quot; with a denial that he had paid Andrew “Benji&quot; Veniamin A$100,000 for five of the murders.
*March 2004 – Federal Justice Minister Chris Ellison announced the Australian Crime Commission would be investigating the murders.
*23 March 2004 – Andrew Veniamin (28) was fatally shot by Mick Gatto in the Carlton pizza restaurant &quot;La Porchella&quot; after an argument. Gatto was arrested and charged with his murder, with police alleging that Gatto had set a trap for Veniamin. Veniamin was a close associate of Carl Williams and was suspected of being a hitman involved in as many as seven underworld murders. Gatto was later acquitted on the grounds of self-defence.
*31 March 2004 – Lewis Moran (62), father of Jason Moran and stepfather of Mark Moran, was shot and killed in broad daylight by two balaclava-clad men in the front bar of the Brunswick Club in Brunswick. Lewis had only recently been released on bail for drug trafficking charges, and police had warned him that his life was in danger. His close friend and fellow Painter and Docker, Bert Wrout, sustained injuries but survived. Graham Kinniburgh and Lewis Moran were notorious for their work on the Melbourne docks. It was later proven that Carl Williams paid for the hit and known hard-man Keith Faure was the driver. His brother Noel Faure and Evangelos Goussis were the executioners.
*12 April 2004 – Terrence Blewitt, a hitman connected with the Williams syndicate, and believed to be the one who shot Graham Kinniburgh in 2003, disappeared without a trace. He was last seen walking towards a blue Hyundai Excel, the same car model that was used as a getaway car in the Kinniburgh murder. His remains were found over a decade later during a search of a scrapyard in Pelmet Crescent, Thomastown in Melbourne&#x27;s north with tests determining that he had been shot.
*8 May 2004 – The body of Lewis Caine was found dumped in Brunswick, after being shot at close range with a shotgun. He was a friend of Carl Williams and had been seen dining with him two nights earlier. This murder was a paid hit by Mario Condello, allegedly in reprisal for the killing of Lewis Moran. In May 2008, Evangelos Goussis was convicted of killing Lewis Moran in March 2004. Goussis was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years for the Caine murder, and in February 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison for the Moran killing. He will be eligible for parole in 2039.
*16 May 2004 – Terrence and Christine Hodson were found executed in their home in Kew. Terrence Hodson was revealed to be a police informant. A week before the bodies were found ABC radio reported that a leaked document revealing Hodson as an informant was doing the rounds in certain underworld circles. It is also reported that an associate of Lewis Moran hired Hodson to murder Carl Williams in 2001. Police drug squad detective Paul Dale allegedly paid Carl Williams $150,000 to organize the hit, who used gunman Rodney &quot;The Duke&quot; Collins for the murders.
*9 June 2004 – Purana Taskforce detectives arrested Carl Williams for conspiracy to murder. His associates Sean Sonnet and Gregg Hildebrandt were arrested only metres from the home of Mario Condello. Victoria Police said the raids had &quot;absolutely&quot; saved Mario Condello from becoming the 28th gangland victim.

===2006===
*6 February 2006 – On the eve of his murder trial, Mario Condello was shot and killed in his driveway at around 10 pm. Condello had dined with Mick Gatto earlier that night and police warned Gatto that he was under increased risk as this was possibly the resumption of the gangland war. The killer is known to police as Rodney &quot;The Duke&quot; Collins.
*20 March 2006 – Melbourne business man Tony Mokbel failed to appear in Court during his trial for the importation of cocaine from Mexico in 2000. Mokbel had been granted bail by Magistrate Phillip Goldberg, despite protests from Police. Goldberg had previously dismissed drug cases brought against Mokbel and his brother. A warrant was issued for his arrest, but Mokbel had not been seen since 5 pm on 19 March 2006. His defence team feared for his life. The week before this date, Mokbel raised concerns for his safety, after an incident not related to this case. He was eventually arrested by Greek police in Athens, Greece on 5 June 2007. Mokbel was successfully extradited to Australia on 17 May 2008.
*26 March 2006 – Lee Patrick Torney&#x27;s body was found dumped down a mineshaft. He was a violent Melbourne criminal and drug trafficker connected to the Williams family and suspected of being involved in several murders, including the 1982 shooting of his former associate Sidney James Graham. Torney had been killed several months earlier with a shovel by Graham John Holden, following an argument.
*27 April 2006 - 31-year-old Michael Phillip Dewhirst died after being stabbed following an altercation with two other men in Palmerston St, Melton. Dewhirst had been a close associate of Dino Dibra, Andrew Veniamin and Paul Kallipolitis, all of whom had previously been murdered in the gangland war. He had been present at the 1998 Dome nightclub shooting in Prahran, where two bouncers were shot, with Dibra and Dewhirst being suspects in the attack. A day after Dewhirst&#x27;s death, Craig Vella was arrested for the fatal stabbing.
*14 October 2006 – Michael &quot;Eyes&quot; Pastras was shot once in the buttocks and once in the thigh at a house in Albion St, Brunswick. Pastras gave evidence at Mick Gatto&#x27;s murder trial that he spoke to Andrew Veniamin on 23 March 2004, the day Veniamin was killed by Gatto. He said that Veniamin never mentioned anything to him about wanting to harm Mr Gatto. But after testifying, he approached the Purana gangland killing taskforce and made a statement refuting what he said in the witness box. Pastras told Purana detectives he saw Veniamin with a gun when he went to meet Mr Gatto in Carlton&#x27;s La Porcella restaurant and that Veniamin told him he wanted Mr Gatto dead. He claimed Veniamin told him: &quot;I&#x27;m fucking dirty on Mick Gatto. He&#x27;s gotta go.&quot; That evidence was not presented to the jury in the Gatto murder trial. Pastras was named in a confidential Victoria Police document that was blamed for prompting the executions of police informer Terrence Hodson and his wife, Christine in 2004. It contained details of what Hodson told police and was leaked to Melbourne&#x27;s underworld shortly before the Hodsons were fatally shot in their Kew home in 2004. His brother Savas Pastras was an associate of Lewis Moran. Pastras, 39, turned up at Moran&#x27;s Essendon unit on 25 October 2002, not knowing police were inside raiding it. One of the detectives asked Moran&#x27;s partner, Virginia Strazdas, who was the man walking up the driveway, and she said he was a friend. Moran&#x27;s partner ignored a police command not to warn the man and managed to slightly open the door and tell him to go away. A detective, Senior Constable Victor Anastasiadis, said he opened the door, recognised Pastras and said, &quot;Sav, come in.&quot; He was taken into Moran&#x27;s house and a search discovered he had $44,000 in $100 and $50 notes hidden under his jacket in a green plastic bag. After removing the bag, Pastras hunched over and began to shake, he said. Detective Senior Sergeant Marty Allison told the court that Pastras had a look of shock and horror on his face when police confronted him. &quot;He looked as though he had seen a ghost; he couldn&#x27;t speak. He opened his mouth but words weren&#x27;t coming out,&quot; Senior Sergeant Allison said. Forensic tests revealed the cash showed traces of heroin and cocaine. Savas Pastras was charged with possessing the proceeds of crime. Police alleged the $44,000 was to be paid to Lewis Moran to settle a drug debt. Pastras&#x27;s lawyer, Stephen Shirrefs, SC, told the court that the warrant used to conduct the raid on Moran&#x27;s home was illegal. &quot;The search of Mr Pastras and the seizure of the money on him only arose because he was invited into the house by police,&quot; Shirrefs said. He said the money could not be deemed proceeds of crime because Moran had not touched the cash and police said it was related to a drug deal &quot;purported to have occurred&quot;. Magistrate Ann Collins ruled in April 2004 that Savas Pastras had no case to answer because police could not prove the money was derived from a crime. Collins cleared Pastras in the Broadmeadows Magistrates Court after finding that police could not prove that the money, stashed in a green plastic shopping bag, had anything to do with the sale of drugs. She also found that police could not prove that traces of heroin and cocaine found on the cash did not come from other sources.

===2009===
*15 June 2009 – Underworld identity Desmond Moran was shot and killed at Ascot Vale in Melbourne&#x27;s north-west. Des Moran was the brother of slain underworld figure Lewis Moran, who was murdered in 2004 during Melbourne&#x27;s gangland war, and uncle to Mark and Jason Moran, who were also killed in gangland disputes. Des Moran originally escaped serious injury in March 2009 when shots were fired outside his Ascot Vale home. He was in his car with a friend when one shot was fired through the front windscreen, narrowly missing the pair. At the time, a Purana Task Force detective said police did not believe that incident was related to the Gangland war. On Tuesday 16 June 2009, his sister-in-law Judy Moran was arrested and charged as the driver, along with two other people in relation to the murder. Judy Moran&#x27;s house was coincidentally damaged by fire while she was in custody.

===2010===
* 19 April 2010 – Carl Williams was bashed to death by fellow inmate Matthew Charles Johnson (37) at HM Barwon Prison Johnson was already serving multiple life sentences for unrelated gangland murders.

== Arrests and sentencing ==
Carl Williams was later charged along with Victor Brincat and Thomas Hentschel. He pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges relating to his arrest in 2001 and in October 2004 was given a seven-year jail sentence, which he was serving in the maximum security Acacia unit of Barwon Prison at the time of his death.

17 September 2004, Alfonso Traglia, Victor Brincat and Carl Williams were charged with the murders of Jason Moran and Pasquale Barbaro. In May 2005 Carl Williams was additionally charged with the murder of Mark Moran, after a former employee agreed to testify that he was Carl&#x27;s driver on the day of the incident, and drove him to a location near Mark&#x27;s house at the time of the murder. Zarah Garde-Wilson, the widow of Lewis Caine, is defending all of the men in their court cases.

In May 2005, Keith Faure, brother Noel Faure, 50, and Evangelos Goussis, 37, all of Geelong were charged with the murder of Lewis Moran and the attempted murder of Bert Wrout. Security footage from Moran&#x27;s murder showed that one of the gunmen had a tattoo identical to one of the accused. Previously Keith and Evangelos been charged with the murder of Lewis Caine. Faure and associate, Evangelos Goussis became the first convicted of murder related to the gangland killings on 3 November 2005.

Known underworld figure Nicholas Ibrahim and Abraham Mokdessi was charged with the murder of Housam Zayat. During the trial in June 2005 an eyewitness to the shooting refused at the last minute to testify against Ibrahim, and was charged with contempt of court.

In June 2005, Mick Gatto was found not guilty of the murder of Andrew Veniamin. During the trial, he claimed he had acted in self-defence after Veniamin pulled out a .38 calibre handgun and threatened to kill him. Gatto claims that during a struggle he was able to turn the gun around on Veniamin and fire one shot into his neck, and one shot in the eye. He also claimed that during the argument, Veniamin had implicated himself in the deaths of Dino Dibra, Paul Kallipolitis and Graham Kinniburgh.

On 3 November 2005, Keith Faure and Evangelos Goussis became the first convicted with murder related to the Melbourne gangland killings. Both have appealed their conviction.

On 14 July 2006, Damien Cossu was arrested at gunpoint while driving in Sydney. He was charged with the murder of Mark Mallia whose tortured body was stuffed in a wheelie bin, dumped in a stormwater drain and set alight. Cossu was also present at the murder of Nik Radev.

On 28 February 2007, Carl Williams pleaded guilty to murdering Jason Moran in June 2003 and his father Lewis Moran in March 2004. He also pleaded guilty to a third murder, but the name of that victim was suppressed until recently when it was announced that it was Mark Mallia.

On 6 June 2007, it was announced that Tony Mokbel had been arrested in a café in Athens. At the time of his arrest, his appearance had changed significantly from when he went missing. Wearing a brown stuff wig and having grown a beard, Mokbel was found carrying a fake Australian passport and driver&#x27;s licence in the name of Stephen Papas. Mokbel was finally extradited back to Melbourne (and Barwon Prison) on 17 May 2008, from Athens via a heavily guarded, private charter plane. His flight path included refuelling in the Maldives and Port Hedland, before landing at Tullamarine. He was then flown in a police helicopter to Barwon Prison. He appeared via video link to the Melbourne Magistrates Court on 20 May 2008.

On the same night Mokbel was arrested, police carried out a raid on an underworld gang calling themselves &#x27;The Company&#x27;. Fourteen other underworld figures were arrested in Melbourne. Drugs, weapons and $790,000 in cash were seized.

Purana Taskforce detectives arrested Angelo Mario Venditti for the murder of Paul Kallipoitis on 29 July 2008.

On 9 March 2011, Judy Moran, the mother of slain sons, Mark and Jason Moran and also the ex-de facto partner of Lewis Moran (who was murdered in 2004) was found guilty of the murder of her brother-in-law Desmond &quot;Tuppence&quot; Moran. Moran claimed that she was visiting her son, Mark&#x27;s grave at Fawkner cemetery at the time as the date of the murder was also the ninth anniversary of Mark&#x27;s death. But the real motive for the crime was on ongoing dispute between Judy and Des over the money remaining after the murders of three family members. Judy Moran drove the shooter, Geoffery Armour and also accomplice Michael Farrugia to and from the Ascot Vale deli where Des was eventually shot and killed. It was then revealed that Armour pleaded guilty to the murder of Des Moran with Farrugia pleading guilty to manslaughter months earlier before becoming the prosecution&#x27;s star witness in the case against Judy Moran in which the jury took seven days to deliberate before finally finding Moran guilty of murder. She will be eligible for parole in 2032 at the age of 88.

==2019 Royal Commission==
In December 2018, it was revealed that one of the defence lawyers involved in the prosecutions had become a police informant, prompting a royal commission. The defence lawyer was known by the pseudonym Lawyer X or Informer 3838. On 1 March 2019, the Court of Appeal revealed that former defence barrister Nicola Gobbo was Lawyer X. The Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants will examine the extent to which cases may have been affected by the conduct of Gobbo, who was registered as an informant with Victoria Police from 1 January 1995 to 13 January 2009.

==In popular culture==
A drama series detailing the gangland war and the efforts made by the Purana taskforce to contain it, &quot;Underbelly&quot;, premiered on the Australia local television Nine Network on 13 February 2008. Ongoing legal proceedings in Victoria made Justice Betty King prohibit the Nine Network from airing the show in Victoria and from providing access to the show via their website. An edited version commenced screening in Victoria on 14 September 2008. In 2011, the ban was lifted, and the series aired in an unedited version in Victoria.

The drama series Fat Tony &amp; Co., which detailed the crimes of and specifically the manhunt to catch Tony Mokbel, made regular references to the gangland killings. It aired on the Nine Network from 23 February to 6 April 2014.

In 2020, the mini-series &quot;Informer 3838&quot; dramatised how Nicola Gobbo was a police informant through the latter stages of her career as a criminal defence barrister. It focuses on Gobbo informing on her high-profile client Carl Williams.

During sessions for the previous album &quot;Secret Messages&quot;, bass guitarist Kelly Groucutt departed and the group was pared down to a trio of Jeff Lynne (who doubled on bass as a result of Groucutt&#x27;s absence), Richard Tandy and Bev Bevan. Recording for the album began in mid-1984, with a planned release for Spring 1985. The addition of several synthesizer tracks and mixing work by Reinhold Mack to the album caused its release to be pushed back to March 1986.

Bandleader Jeff Lynne took a one-man-band approach to the recording, doing the production, guitar work, synthesizers, and percussion on the album mostly by himself, though keyboardist Richard Tandy made some key musical contributions as well. Describing their recording process, Richard Tandy said that &quot;the usual way was to have a stack of keyboards in the control room, and me and Jeff [Lynne] playing along to a drum track, and Bev [Bevan] adding his things later.&quot; 

The track &quot;Endless Lies&quot; features Lynne doing a vocal delivery reminiscent of Roy Orbison. Lynne said in a 2013 interview: &quot;I played Roy [Orbison] &#x27;Endless Lies&#x27; in his house, and I went, &#x27;This is me trying to copy you in the middle,; have a listen&#x27;. He listened and he chuckled, and he went, &#x27;That&#x27;s actually pretty good&#x27;.&quot; The song was originally recorded for the double LP version of &quot;Secret Messages&quot;, but was removed from &quot;Secret Messages&quot; when that album was downscaled to a single album. It reappears on &quot;Balance of Power&quot; in a slightly reworked and more compact form.

==Release==

The album is originally issued on the Jet label in various countries however was corrected to epic shortly after. Europe&#x27;s CD releases were on CDEPC26467 (Epic) in March 1986. The US (ZK40048) and Japan (32DP407) CD releases were on CBS Associated.

The single &quot;Calling America&quot; was a Top 40 hit. The video for &quot;Calling America&quot; was shot in Paris, and contains shots of the band playing in front of Centre Georges Pompidou. A video was also made for the single &quot;So Serious.&quot;

A remastered version of the album was released in 2007 by Legacy Recordings. This reissue featured seven bonus tracks, including an alternate version of &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot;, B-sides &quot;Caught in a Trap&quot; and &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;, and previously unreleased songs like &quot;In for the Kill&quot;.

==Tour and aftermath==
For the first time in four years, ELO played live concerts and TV appearances to promote the album in the UK and Europe. The touring lineup consisted primarily of Lynne on lead vocals and electric guitar, Bevan on drums, and Richard Tandy on keyboards. Also in the touring band were Louis Clark on keyboards, Mik Kaminski on violin and synthesizer, Dave Morgan on backing vocals, acoustic guitar, and vocoder, and Martin Smith on bass guitar. For one UK show, George Harrison also performed in a guest appearance.

They played as the opening act for Rod Stewart a handful of times, including on their final show on 13 July 1986 in Stuttgart, Germany. This would be the band&#x27;s last live concert for fifteen years.

&quot;Balance of Power&quot; was the last studio album by the Electric Light Orchestra before their initial disbanding. The band name was briefly resurrected in 2001, then changed to &quot;Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO&quot; from 2014 onwards.

<text>The Fifth Elephant is a 1999 fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the 24th book in the &quot;Discworld&quot; series. It introduces the clacks, a long-distance semaphore system.

==Plot summary==
The Ankh-Morpork City Watch is expanding; there is now a Traffic department, and the clacks is replacing homing pigeons for communications between officers. The Watch is investigating the theft of the replica Scone of Stone (a parody of the real-life Stone of Scone) from the Ankh-Morpork Dwarf Bread Museum and the murder of Wallace Sonky, the inventor of preventatives.

Samuel Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch and Duke of Ankh, is sent to the remote region of Überwald as an ambassador to take advantage of the coronation of the Low King of the Dwarves to negotiate for increased imports of fat. Underground fat deposits are abundant in Überwald as a fifth Discworld-supporting elephant impacted there in prehistoric times, according to legend.

Überwald is the traditional home of the Disc&#x27;s dwarfs. The election of the progressive Rhys Rhysson as Low King resulted from split opposition amongst various dwarf clans and the growing influence of Ankh-Morpork as the largest dwarf city on the Disc. A cabal of local werewolves seek to exploit this opportunity to destabilize the already deeply divided dwarf society. They instigate the apparent theft of the real Scone of Stone hoping to cause a civil war between traditionalist and progressive dwarfs and isolate the country under the werewolves&#x27; feudal leadership.

In his capacity as ambassador Vimes meets the leaders of the local vampires, werewolves and dwarfs, investigating the planned putsch along the way. Back in Ankh-Morpork, Captain Angua, alerted by Gavin, a wolf and old friend, learns that her werewolf brother Wolfgang is the head of the conspiracy and sets out to Überwald to stop him. Consequently, Captain Carrot also abandons the Watch and pursues her across the country, enlisting the talking dog Gaspode to follow her scent. Lord Vetinari appoints the incompetent Sergeant Colon as acting captain.

Colon becomes increasingly strict and paranoid, punishing members of the Watch for minor or imagined infractions. He also makes a number of specisist remarks about troll and dwarf officers, leading officers to leave the Watch, with the number of Watchmen under Colon&#x27;s command eventually dropping by two-thirds.

The Ankh-Morpork City Watch recover the replica Scone of Stone. It is undamaged, but they suspect that someone has made a replica of the replica. In response to Colon&#x27;s refusal to pay the Watchmen (having burnt the pay chitty along with the rest of the mounting paperwork), Corporal Nobby Nobbs, who lost out on promotion as Colon&#x27;s aide de camp, sets up the Guild of Watchmen with himself as Guild President. The other members of the Watch join and protest against Colon, but eventually it dwindles to just Nobby, Constable Visit, zombie Constable Reg Shoe and golem Constable Dorfl.

In Überwald, Vimes begins an unofficial investigation into the theft of the real Scone of Stone. He determines that the Scone was not in fact stolen, but destroyed in situ and its remains concealed by mixing them with the sand on the floor of the cave. Following an attempt on the Low King-designate&#x27;s life, Vimes is wrongly imprisoned by the dwarfs but escapes with the help of Lady Margolota, Überwald&#x27;s most senior vampire. In the forest of the wintry countryside he is forced by Wolfgang into playing &quot;the game&quot;, in which he must outrun the werewolves to survive. Carrot and Angua arrive just in time to save Vimes from the murderous pack.

Vimes&#x27; wife has been taken to the castle of Angua&#x27;s werewolf family, so the commander and his entourage set out to save her. Managing to defeat the power-hungry Wolfgang, they are also able to restore the Scone of Stone. However, it is revealed not only that the Scone recovered is in fact the Ankh-Morpork-made copy, but that the Stone is periodically replaced. It is used to compel the Low King&#x27;s &#x27;Ideas Taster&#x27; (advisor) Dee to confess to his role in its theft and the assassination attempt, being driven by jealousy of Ankh-Morporkian dwarves being allowed to be openly female.

Back in their embassy, Lady Sybil finally manages to tell Vimes that she is pregnant, but the Morporkians are once more attacked by Wolfgang. In a stand-off, Wolfgang resists arrest and is killed by Commander Vimes with a Clacks flare. With the Low King&#x27;s regalia returned, the enthronement ceremony finally takes place, and Vimes is granted prime rates for fat imports to Ankh-Morpork, thus fulfilling his original mission. As the Morporkian delegation leaves, the Low King implies that he is in fact female.

The book finishes with Carrot and Angua returning to Ankh-Morpork whilst Vimes and Lady Sybil take a second honeymoon. Carrot takes back his old rank of captain, returns Colon to his duties as a sergeant and orders him and Nobby to gather the rest of the Watch together.

==Reception==
&quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; was a finalist for the 2000 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel.

At the &quot;SF Site&quot;, Steven H Silver judged it as &quot;not, unfortunately, a good starting place&quot; for readers unfamiliar with Discworld and said that it &quot;may be the weakest of the books featuring the City Watch&quot;, with the subplots involving Carrot and the officers back in Ankh-Morpork being &quot;more entertaining than the portions dealing with Vimes,&quot; but emphasized that it is nonetheless &quot;still a good novel&quot; with a &quot;well-written mystery&quot;.

&quot;January Magazine&quot; found it to be &quot;richer than (...) &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;&quot; and &quot;satisfyingly similar to (...) &quot;Jingo&quot;, and noted its &quot;violent and disturbing denouement&quot;.

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; lauded it as &quot;gloriously uproarious&quot; and &quot;satirical, devious, knowing, irreverent, unsparing and, above all, funny,&quot; while &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; commended it as an &quot;exuberant tale of mystery and invention&quot; and a &quot;heavyweight of lightness&quot;, which &quot;skewers everything from monarchy to fascism, as well as communism and capitalism, oil wealth and ethnic identities, Russian plays, immigration, condoms and evangelical Christianity.&quot;

==Origin==
In a 2000 interview, Pratchett stated that the novel had been inspired by his &quot;finding whole novels in throwaway lines [from earlier novels]. Take Uberwald--a huge empire has crumbled, a lot of political certainties have gone, there are new alliances ... there are a lot of resonances there which I didn&#x27;t realise existed when I put it on the Discworld map.&quot;

<text>Turkmenistan Airlines (, commonly known as Türkmenhowaýollary) is the flag carrier and only airline of Turkmenistan, headquartered in Ashgabat. An Open joint-stock company, it operates domestic and international passenger and cargo services mainly from its hub at Ashgabat International Airport.

== History ==
The state-owned service Turkmenistan Airlines was founded 4 May 1992. In 1992, Turkmenistan Airlines became the first airline in the former Soviet Union to purchase a Boeing 737-300. In April 1993, Turkmenistan became a full member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The first flight on a cargo aircraft IL-76 was completed on 19 April 1993 from Ashgabat to Brest, Belarus.

From 2001, the airline phased out its Soviet-era fleet for a more modern fleet of Boeing 717s, which were extensively used for service on domestic routes until their retirement. Seven of the 717 series were purchased; the first was presented at the MAKS air show in 2001. On 29 April 2009 a Boeing 737-700 was demonstrated in Ashgabat and on 2 September Boeing announced that Turkmenistan Airlines had confirmed an order for three more such aircraft worth $192 million. Autumn airline supplemented by three Boeing airliners. In May 2009, the airline opened the Lachyn () Hotel in Ashgabat for transit passengers. Designed for 200 guests, it is located on Bitarap Türkmenistan şaýoly, which connects the city center to the Ashgabat Airport. On 1 July 2011, the airline began to operate an Electronic ticket system on all flights. Booking flights can be carried out in the standard way, but information about air travel began to be given out in the form of a passenger itinerary receipt.

On 8 May 2013, a Boeing 737-800 was delivered. On 3 June 2013 a fourth Boeing 737-800 arrived, and on 18 December 2013 a fifth Boeing 737-800 arrived.

In 2012, the airline began printing the full-colour magazine &quot;Lachyn&quot; (&quot;Falcon&quot;). This was the first in-flight product in Turkmenistan. The magazine is also distributed in the halls for official delegations and VIP-zones of airports in Turkmenistan. In the same year, the airline carried 57,500 passengers to 15 international destinations and approx. 90,000 passengers on domestic routes per month (c. 1.77 million passengers per year).

In January 2013 regular cargo flights to Brno commenced. In March 2013 a new ticket sales centre was opened at 61 Atatürk Street. This building houses 30 sales offices; 17 for domestic flights and 13 for international routes. In August 2013 a regular passenger flight to Lviv was started. In October of the same year, flights to Donetsk and Riga commenced followed in December by the first scheduled service to Western Europe - Paris. In March 2014, Turkmenistan Airlines announced that it was to commence long-haul flights using its newly acquired Boeing 777-200LRs. The aircraft were utilized on flights to Bangkok, Beijing, Birmingham, Delhi and Istanbul.

=== Re-organization ===

In 2017, the air transport enterprise of the State National Service Türkmenhowaýollary was transformed into a joint-stock company Turkmenistan Airlines.

In 2019, Turkmenistan Airlines officially opened ticket sales on its newly launched website.

On 4 February 2019, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) suspended Turkmenistan Airlines&#x27; permission to fly in the EU. This forced the airline to terminate its routes to the United Kingdom, France and Germany. In December, Turkmenistan Airlines resumed regular passenger traffic to European Union countries after a 10-month break.

In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and for the safety of passengers, Turkmenistan Airlines suspended all international regular passenger flights in March 2020. In order to prevent the import and spread of coronavirus infection, all planes arriving in Turkmenistan from abroad are redirected to the Turkmenabat International Airport or Turkmenbashi International Airport.

Since March 2021, Turkmenistan Airlines switched to the new Piece Concept baggage system.

In May 2022, Turkmenistan Airlines announced the resumption of flights to Dubai, the popular UAE tourist destination as the travel industry starts recovering from the COVID-19 impact. In 2022, regular passenger flights to Istanbul, Kazan, Moscow, Dubai, Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi were resumed. Aircraft began to return to Ashgabat (during the pandemic, they were redirected to Turkmenabat and Turkmenbashi).

In February 2023, the airline launched a stopover service on domestic flights, which involves a flight with a long transfer, when the air carrier offers to spend transit time not at the airport, but in the city next to which the airport is located.

In spring 2023, the airline purchased for the first time two cargo aircraft of the Airbus A330-200P2F type. It was the first of its type to be used in Central Asia. New cargo flights on airplanes Airbus A330-200P2F was opened to Incheon, Hanoi, Milan, Shenzhen and Xi&#x27;an.

The first of Turkmenistan Airlines Boeing 777-300ER aircraft (368-seat, three-class configuration) entered service in December 2023, initially linking Ashgabat with Bangkok. The Boeing 777-300ER have replaced the retired Boeing 757-200s. The Boeing 777-300ER are generally used on Turkmenistan Airlines Far East destinations, to London and Bangkok.

As of December 2023, Turkmenistan Airlines was maintaining services to Russia, Germany, UAE, China PR, Turkey, Thailand and England.

In January 2024, Turkmenistan Airlines confirmed Milan, Ho Chi Minh City, Jeddah and Kuala Lumpur as one of its new destinations for 2024. 

Starting December 2024, Turkmenistan Airlines offers free AdonisOne In-flight entertainment on international flights aboard their aircraft.

<text>The Hôtel Matignon (, ) is the official residence of the Prime Minister of France. It is located in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, at 57 Rue de Varenne. The name Matignon is often used as a metonym for the governmental action of the French prime minister. The current tenant is Prime Minister François Bayrou, who took office on 13 December 2024.

==History==
===17th century===
In 1649, as part of his plan for the construction of the Hôtel des Invalides, Louis XIV decided to restore the old &quot;Chemin du Bois de la Garenne,&quot; which had become the &quot;Rue de Varenne,&quot; that linked Saint-Germain-des-Prés, at the western end of Paris, with the marshy terrain chosen as the new building site. Henceforth the &quot;Noble Faubourg&quot; gained a new lease on life, the proximity of Versailles being irresistible for an aristocracy who lived exclusively by and for the Court.

===18th century===
On 30 September 1717, Christian-Louis de Montmorency Luxembourg, Prince of Tigny and Marshal of France, purchased, for the sum of 91 Livres, 2869 toises (30,000 m2) of land along the Rue de Varenne. He was a lover of gardens and intended to create a country park. In 1722, he commissioned a little-known architect, Jean Courtonne, to conceive and construct a mansion. His success in this endeavour won him entry to the Academy of Architecture, where he wrote a much-remarked &quot;Treatise on Perspectives&quot; (1725). But the expense of the enterprise forced the Prince of Tigny to sell, and it was Jacques Goyon, Count of Matignon who bought the Hôtel, completed in 1725, as a present for his son, the Duke of Valentinois.

Courtonne&#x27;s design was highly original. Rising from a broad terrace, the main residence, a two-storey building crowned by a balustrade, comprises two suites of rooms. Access from the street is gained by a portico ornamented by columns. This archway reveals the main courtyard, bracketed by two low wings of offices and outbuildings, to the right of which are situated another courtyard, the stables and the kitchens. The façade is broken by three advances. Those to the right and left house the staircases, while the central pavilion displays a magnificent balcony sculpted with lion motifs. Visitors&#x27; admiration is drawn by two singular architectural features: the segmented cupola of the entrance hall and, to its right, the first room to have been originally designed for dining. The façade seen from the garden runs the entire length of the buildings, concealing the main courtyard and the servants&#x27; yard. Although the design results in a slight imbalance in the natural disposition of the mansion, it respects the placement of a central pavilion with three panels surmounted by a broken pediment bearing the arms of the owners.
Its rich interiors made the Hôtel Matignon one of the most elegant and most frequented mansions of Paris. The wood panelling is the work of Michel Lange, who had already decorated the Grand Salon of the Hôtel d&#x27;Évreux (today the Ambassadors&#x27; Salon of the Élysée Palace. The cornices and the stucco work are by Jean-Martin Pelletier and Jean Herpin. At the time, any &quot;well-dressed&quot; person was authorised by the owners to visit these splendors in their absence.

In 1731, the wife of Jacques de Matignon, daughter of Anthony I Grimaldi, succeeded her father as head of the principality of Monaco. In 1734, their son, Honoré III, mounted the throne. Although he was open to the revolutionary ideas of the time, he was imprisoned on 20 September 1793. At his liberation a year later, he was ruined, and his property under seal. His sons obtained restitution, but they were obliged to put the mansion up for sale in 1802.

===19th century===
It was bought by Anne Éléonore Franchi. A professional dancer, she caught the eye, at the Carnival of Venice, of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, who had three children by her. The Duke died in 1793, and finding herself in Vienna and once more a dancer, she became the mistress of Joseph II. The Empress, Maria Theresa, who had no love for her, had her expelled from Austria. Exiled to the East Indies, she returned to France in the company of the Scottish banker Quentin Crawford. The two of them refurnished the Hôtel, which once again became a festive gathering place for the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; society and a hotbed of opposition. Close friends of Joséphine de Beauharnais, the couple grew increasingly open in their criticism of Napoleon after the divorce.

In 1808, the Hôtel Matignon passed into the hands of one of the best-known figures of the first half of the 19th century – Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, Prince of Bénévent and Deputy Great Elector. Four times a week, he gave dinners for 36 guests, prepared in his kitchens by the renowned Boucher. As the shrewd diplomat that he was, he held a great number of balls in honour of the imperial family. In 1811, Napoleon called on Talleyrand to reimburse the city of Hamburg the four millions it had paid him to avoid incorporation into the new French &quot;département&quot; of the Bouches-de-l&#x27;Elbe. As the endeavour had failed, Talleyrand did not consider it necessary to return the sum. He was obliged to put the Hôtel up for sale; the Emperor had it purchased for 1,280 000 Francs, but Talleyrand never reimbursed Hamburg.

In 1815, at the start of the &quot;Restoration&quot;, Louis XVIII traded the Hôtel Matignon for the Élysée Palace, which belonged to Louise Marie Thérèse Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans, sister of Philippe Égalité, and the separated wife of the Duc de Bourbon. She promptly installed a community of nuns on the premises, charged with praying for the souls of victims of the French Revolution. Her niece inherited the property in 1822 and moved the community to the Rue de Picpus, so that she could rent out the Hôtel.

By the 1830&#x27;s the Hotel was owned by Bathilde&#x27;s niece, Adelaide d&#x27;Orleans. She rented it to a visiting wealthy American, Colonel Herman Thorn, who lived there with his large family for over a decade, and renovated it extensively. He was rumoured to have spent 1,000,000 francs on the upgrade.

Following the revolution of 1848, it was planned to place the Hôtel Matignon at the disposal of the head of the executive branch of the new Republic. But if General Cavaignac chose to reside there until December 1848, the Prince President, Napoleon III, preferred the Élysée Palace.

A short time later, the Hôtel was sold to the Duke of Galliera, Raffaele de Ferrari, a member of the Genoese nobility and husband of Marie de Brignole Sale, great-niece to the princess of Monaco. Together, they possessed one of the great fortunes of the time; it is claimed that they owned half of Genoa. Founder of the Crédit Mobilier, Raffaele financed many of the major construction projects of the second half of the 19th century – railroads in Austria, Latin America, Portugal and France (the Paris-Lyon-Marseille line), the digging of the Fréjus tunnel and the Suez Canal, and the Paris buildings designed by Baron Haussmann.

Three years after the fall of Napoleon III in 1870, the Duchess proposed that the Count of Paris take up residence at the Rue de Varenne. He came to occupy the ground floor of the Hôtel Matignon. On 14 May 1886, this was the setting of one of the century&#x27;s most sumptuous receptions – three thousand guests, the entire aristocracy of France, the diplomatic corps and numerous political figures thronged to celebrate the marriage of Princess Amélie, the Count&#x27;s daughter, with Carlos, heir to the Portuguese throne. The story goes that, on the day of the reception, the President had a sudden desire to visit the Bois de Boulogne but was unable to leave the Elysée because of the congested traffic. The following day, no doubt alarmed by such a large gathering of monarchists in the capital, the president of the council, Charles de Freycinet, called for a law exiling pretenders to the French throne. The next week, the legislation was passed.

The Duchess of Galliera was disenchanted and quit Paris, leaving her mansion to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor, who made it his embassy in France. But the First World War found the two countries on opposite sides and, confiscated in 1919, the Hôtel Matignon was declared &quot;enemy property&quot;. On 21 November 1922, after prolonged negotiations, France once more assumed ownership. During World War I, the Hôtel was also the place where the philatelic collection of Philipp von Ferrary (the most valuable stamp collection ever assembled) was deposited when its owner, the son of the Duke of Galliera and an Austrian citizen, had to flee France in 1917. The collection was later broken up and sold by the French government after the war, as war reparations. In 1923, the Hôtel Matignon was designated as a historical monument by the state.

==Home of the head of government ==

There were plans to turn the mansion into a museum – the property was to be subdivided and individual dwellings built, including the adjacent mansion built by the architect Jean Walter in 1924. However, Gaston Doumergue learned of the plans and decided to make it the headquarters of the President of the Council of Ministers (&quot;Président du Conseil&quot;), as the position of head of government was known under the Third Republic. The architect Paul Bigot took the necessary steps and, in 1935, Pierre Étienne Flandin became the first new occupant.

In 1936, the &quot;Matignon Accords&quot; were signed between Léon Blum and the leaders of the spring 1936 strikes, introducing the 40-hour work week and paid vacations.

Édouard Daladier, prime minister at the start of the Second World War, did not leave his apartment near the Arc de Triomphe and worked at the War Ministry. During the war the government moved to the city of Vichy, but on 21 August 1944, it was in Paris that the resistance leader Yvon Morandat and his companion seized the &quot;Government Mansion&quot;, the Hôtel Matignon. In their haste they even confused the Avenue Matignon, located on the Right Bank of the Seine, with the Hôtel Matignon, situated on the Left Bank.

It was there that, on 25 August, General Charles de Gaulle convened the &quot;Provisory Council of the Republic&quot;. Subsequent presidents of the council followed his example and, his return in 1958, like the new republic, changed nothing more at Matignon than the occupant&#x27;s name, which, instead of president of the council, became prime minister.

==Miscellaneous==
*Several important agreements were signed here:
** 1936 Matignon Accords between the French employers&#x27; union and the Confédération Générale du Travail workers&#x27; union, following from the accession of the Front Populaire to power. They guaranteed trade union membership and negotiating rights, a 40-hour working week and paid workers&#x27; holidays.
** 1988 Matignon Agreements with respect to New Caledonia. They called for increased New Caledonian territorial autonomy between the French government, Kanak independence activists and French settlers.
*The park of the Hôtel comprises three hectares, in comparison with the two hectares of the gardens of the Elysee Palace, and is considered to be the largest non-public garden in Paris.

<text>Luodian County () (Bouyei language: Lachos xianq) is a county under the administration of Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in the south of Guizhou province, China, bordering Guangxi to the south.

The climate in the area is humid subtropical, with strong monsoon influences bringing heavy rain during the summer. Winters are dry due to the influence of the Siberian high-pressure system.

The county seat and the largest town in the county is also named Luodian; it was formerly known as Longping.

The county is frequented by both Chinese and foreign geologists, with the core area of work called Big Guizhoutan, or Big Guizhou Shoal. This has been called a &quot;treasure land for Triassic Period research.&quot;

==Administrative divisions==
Luodian County is divided into 1 subdistrict, 8 towns and 1 township:
;subdistrict
*Huxing 斛兴街道
;towns
*Longping 龙坪镇
*Bianyang 边阳镇
*Fengting 逢亭镇
*Moyang 沫阳镇
*Maojing 茂井镇
*Luokun 罗悃镇
*Hongshuihe 红水河镇
*Muyin 木引镇
;township
*Fengting 凤亭乡

==History==

In 629, the Tang dynasty put Le&#x27;an County (now Luodian) under the jurisdiction of Zhuangzhou.

Luodian was the seat of the Yi-speaking Luodian Kingdom () in the 9th century.

In 1292, Yuan dynasty set up Yuanfu, Le&#x27;an County was renamed Luobo County, and was put under its jurisdiction.

During the Ming dynasty, Luodian County was affiliated to the Luoboguan Inspection Department of Xilongzhou, Guangxi Province.

In the Qing dynasty, in 1727, Yongfeng Prefecture was set up, and the Luoju Court (now Luodian) was within the territory.

In 1749, Luojing Prefecture was renamed to the Prefecture of Fanzhou and was transferred to Guiyang Prefecture.

In 1913, Luojing was under the jurisdiction of Yuzhong Circuit (in Guiyang). In 1914, Luojing was set up as a county of Guizhou Province.

On March 23, 1951, Luodian was under PRC control, and the next day the Luodian County People&#x27;s Government was established.

<doc id="569111" wikidata="Q810198" url="?curid=569111" title="Basionym">
<text>In the scientific name of organisms, basionym or basyonym means the original name on which a new name is based; the author citation of the new name should include the authors of the basionym in parentheses. The term &quot;basionym&quot; is used in both botany and zoology. In zoology, alternate terms such as original combination or protonym are sometimes used instead. Bacteriology uses a similar term, basonym, spelled without an &quot;i&quot;.

Although &quot;basionym&quot; and &quot;protonym&quot; are often used interchangeably, they have slightly different technical definitions. A basionym is the &quot;correct&quot; spelling of the original name (according to the applicable nomenclature rules), while a protonym is the &quot;original&quot; spelling of the original name. These are typically the same, but in rare cases may differ.

When creating new taxonomic names, there are specific rules about how basionyms can be used. A new combination or name at new rank must be based directly on the original basionym rather than on any intermediate combinations. This means that if a species is transferred between multiple genera over time, each new combination must refer back to the original name rather than to more recent combinations. This helps maintain a clear chain of nomenclature and prevents confusion about the ultimate source of the name. For example, when transferring a species that has already been moved to a different genus, taxonomists must cite the original species name as the basionym, not the intermediate combination.

==Use in botany==
The term &quot;basionym&quot; is used in botany only for the circumstances where a previous name exists with a useful description, and the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; (ICNafp) does not require a full description with the new name. A basionym must therefore be legitimate. Basionyms are regulated by the code&#x27;s articles 6.10, 7.3, 41, and others. 

When a current name has a basionym, the author or authors of the basionym are included in parentheses at the start of the author citation. If a basionym is later found to be illegitimate, it becomes a replaced synonym and the current name&#x27;s author citation must be changed so that the basionym authors do not appear.

Historical rules for basionyms have evolved over time. Prior to 1 January 1953, the requirements for referencing basionyms were less stringent: an indirect reference to a basionym or replaced synonym was sufficient for valid publication of a new combination, name at new rank, or replacement name. After this date, more explicit references became required.

=== Replaced synonyms ===
In some cases, taxonomists may need to publish a replacement name even when working with a legitimate existing name. This situation arises when it is not possible to publish a legitimate new combination or name at new rank, such as when the new name would create an illegitimate homonym (duplicate name) or when the name cannot be validly published under the nomenclatural rules (for example, in the case of tautonyms).

=== Types and original material ===
When working with basionyms and new combinations, there are specific rules regarding type specimens. Because a new combination is typified by the type of its basionym, all original material must also come from the basionym. This means that taxonomists cannot designate a lectotype (a type specimen selected after the original description) from specimens that were only cited or used in the later new combination but were not part of the original material of the basionym. Such specimens could only be designated as neotypes if no original material exists.

=== &quot;Combinatio nova&quot; ===
The basionym of the name &quot;Picea abies&quot; (the Norway spruce) is &quot;Pinus abies&quot;. The species was originally named &quot;Pinus abies&quot; by Carl Linnaeus and so the author citation of the basionym is simply &quot;L.&quot; Later on, botanist Gustav Karl Wilhelm Hermann Karsten decided this species should not be grouped in the same genus (&quot;Pinus&quot;) as the pines, so he transferred it to the genus &quot;Picea&quot; (the spruces). The new name &quot;Picea abies&quot; is &quot;combinatio nova&quot;, a new combination (abbreviated &quot;comb. nov.&quot;). With author citation, the current name is &quot;&quot;Picea abies&quot; (L.) Karst.&quot;

=== &quot;Status novus&quot; ===
In 1964, the subfamily name Pomoideae, which had been in use for the group within family Rosaceae that have pome fruit like apples, was no longer acceptable under the code of nomenclature because it is not based on a genus name. Claude Weber did not consider the family name Malaceae to be taxonomically appropriate, so he created the name Maloideae at the rank of subfamily, referring to the original description of the family, and using the same type. This change of rank from family to subfamily is an example of &quot;status novus&quot; (abbreviated &quot;stat. nov.&quot;), also called a &quot;name at new rank&quot;.

<doc id="569116" wikidata="Q617008" url="?curid=569116" title="Ballyfermot">
<text>Ballyfermot () is a suburb of Dublin, Ireland. It is located seven kilometres (5 miles) west of the city centre, south of Phoenix Park. It is bordered by Chapelizod on the north, by Bluebell on the south, by Inchicore on the east, and by Palmerstown and Clondalkin on the west. The River Liffey lies to the north, and the Grand Canal, now a recreational waterway, lies to the south of Ballyfermot. Ballyfermont lies within the postal district Dublin 10. Cherry Orchard, which is also a suburb, is sometimes considered to be within Ballyfermot.

Ballyfermot is also a civil parish in the historical barony of Uppercross.

==Toponymy==
The place name &quot;Ballyfermot&quot;—rendered in Irish &quot;Baile Formaid&quot; and sometimes &quot;Baile Thormaid&quot;—is derived from the Middle Irish &quot;baile&quot; (&quot;farmstead&quot;), and the Old Norse personal name &quot;Þormundr&quot;. It is also referred to colloquially by Dubliners as &quot;Ballyer&quot; for short.

== History ==
The 12th century saw the Cambro-Normans expand west across the Irish Sea from Pembroke in Wales into Leinster. After the Treaty of Windsor in 1175, through feudal land grants and intermarriage, the Cambro Norman knights came into possession of land in south and west Dublin, along with the local Irish chieftain who supported them, Mac Giolla Mocolmog. Family names associated with the area at this time included Mac Giolla Mocolmog (FitzDermot), O&#x27;Cathasaidhe, Fitzwilliam, Le Gros (Grace), O&#x27;Dualainghe, Tyrrell, O&#x27;Hennessy, O&#x27;Morchain, Dillon, O&#x27;Kelly, De Barneval (Barnewall), and Newcomyn (Newcomen).

In 1307, the manor of Ballyfermot was held by William Fitzwilliam and his wife Avice, who leased part of it to Thomas Cantock, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland. The land passed from the Fitzwilliams to their relatives, the Clahulls from Dundrum, and later to the Barnawalls of Drimnagh Castle.

Ballyfermot Castle was constructed on the site of a Norman motte and baily. Located northwest of the intersection of Le Fanu and Raheen Roads, it was the centre of the Upper (west) and Lower (east) Ballyfermot townships. Built in stone by Wolfram De Barneval in the fourteenth century, it was a stronghold against the O&#x27;Byrne and O&#x27;Toole families. These native Gaelic families had been discommoded from their original lands near Naas.

The castle was inherited by Robert Newcomen, who enhanced it and held it into the mid-seventeenth century. Its political importance subsequently declined with the Newcomens, culminating with the suicide of Thomas Gleadowe-Newcomen in 1825. It later housed a school. The castle defence wing to the south and east is reputed to have been destroyed by fire. Ballyfermot House, known locally as &#x27;the tiled house&#x27;, was built by the Verveer family. In his &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland,&quot; Samuel Lewis places a Captain Lampier and his wife Bridget (Cavanaugh of Goldenbridge) (Lieutenant Joseph Lamphier, 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers and Bridget Mary Cavanagh) as living there in 1834. It stood to the north of the castle&#x27;s aquaculture pond. Built in the early eighteenth century, the house had a slated façade in the Dutch style.

The nineteenth century newspaper publisher and writer Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu, proprietor of the &quot;Dublin Evening Mail&quot;, lived in nearby Chapelizod when not in residence his city townhouse at Merrion Square. Ballyfermot and Chapelizod feature in his novel &quot;The House by the Churchyard&quot; and some of his other works. This large Georgian house still adjoins Church Lane next to St. Laurence&#x27;s parish churchyard in Chapelizod. The eighteenth-century church, alongside the original medieval bell tower, is still in use. It serves the united parish of Ballyfermot, Palmerstown, and Chapelizod in the Church of Ireland. Le Fanu Road is named after him, as is Le Fanu Park, referred to locally as The Lawns. Le Fanu was a mentor of the writer Bram Stoker author of &quot;Dracula&quot;, who did the theatre reviews for his newspaper &quot;The Dublin Evening Mail&quot;.

A short distance from the castle site at the south-east end of Le Fanu Park is a mound which covers the ruins and churchyard of the rectory church of St Laurence. It is believed to have roots in Celtic Christianity, perhaps a minor branch of the Tallaght Maelruain or Kilnamanagh monasteries. It was connected to the Knights of St John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham in the 13th century. The churchyard ruins survived into the 1960s. This church served Ballyfermot and the surrounding townlands into the late 17th century.

Other manor houses of note include Johnstown House (St John&#x27;s College), Colepark House, Sarsfield House, Sevenoaks, Floraville, Auburn Villa and Gallanstown House. The Ballyfermot townlands were transferred from the Barony of Newcastle to the Barony of Uppercross in the late nineteenth century, under the Local Government Act of 1898.

The dairy and stud farms of Ballyfermot were acquired by the authorities in the 1930s. They were developed into suburban housing estates needed to alleviate the post war housing shortage. This development, along with estates at Drimnagh, Crumlin, Walkinstown and other pockets in the south city, and Cabra, Finglas and Donnycarney along with smaller pockets in the north city provided modern accommodation to facilitate the Dublin City Council public/private housing programs. Initially leased to waiting lists, these homes were sold to their residents, even prior to similar government initiatives in the United Kingdom. The first estate was built in the late 1940s at Ballyfermot Lower. South of Sarsfield House and Ballyfermot Road it was originally called the Sarsfield Estate. The street names reflect this historical theme. Gradually, the adjacent townlands to the south of Ballyfermot Road and north of Grange Cross - Ballyfermot Upper, Blackditch, Cherry Orchard, Raheen and Gallanstown were similarly developed. Johnstown, a townland of Palmerstown, located around Johnstown House (St John&#x27;s College De La Salle) south of Chapelizod was developed for residential housing. Now divided along the Drumfin/Glenaulin/Sports Park perimeter, the west portion was retained by Palmerstown, while the east portion became the township/electoral district of Drumfin in Dublin City (Local Government Act 1993), and included in postal district Dublin 10.

During the 1970s Ballyfermot suffered from a lack of facilities and opportunities for its residents; however, these conditions have improved over time.

==Politics==
In local government elections, Ballyfermot is part of the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh Ward. Since the local elections in 2024, the local elected representatives on Dublin City Council are:
* Vincent Jackson (Independent)
* Philip Sutcliffe Snr. (Independent Ireland)
* Hazel de Nortúin (People Before Profit)
* Ray Cunningham (Green Party)
* Daithí Doolan (Sinn Féin)

Ballyfermot is part of the Dublin South-Central Dáil constituency.

== Commerce ==
The area is now a centre of national commercial distribution, with access to the national trunk roads. Ballyfermot is bordered to the north by the N4, to the south by the N7 and to the west by the M50.

A number of Irish motor distributors are based in Ballyfermot. They include Toyota, Nissan, General Motors, J. C. Bamford (JCB), Harris Assembly and Hilux. They are centred around Kylemore Road, home to companies such as Thornton&#x27;s Recycling, C&amp;C, FBD, and Royal Liver Insurance. The industrial estates include Park West and JFK.

===Parks===
The California Hills Park (also known as Glenaulin Park) is the largest recreational space in the area. The name originated as a colloquialism - there were few designated play facilities in the very early days of suburban development and &quot;the California Hills&quot; was the name used by local movie-going kids who played &#x27;Cowboys and Indians&#x27; there. The name later achieved official recognition due to popular usage. The park covers part of the great esker east of Dublin, and overlooks the Liffey Valley from the south. From Le Fanu and Kylemore Roads to the east, it falls to the landscaped valley of a Liffey tributary, the Glenaulin Stream. It runs west toward Glenaulin and Drumfin Roads which adjoin the park as it stretches in a crescent through Palmerstown. The Chapelizod Bypass runs northwest alongside and Kylemore Road joins the motorway near the West County Hotel. California Hills Park has views north over the Strawberry Beds to the Phoenix Park and the Farmleigh clock tower at Castleknock is a prominent landmark. California Hills include&#x27;s Gales-Drumfinn Avenue Park, known locally as &quot;The Gaels&quot;, used for football, golf practice, cross country runs and walks and includes a children&#x27;s play area. There is an entrance to the park beside the Ballyfermot Leisure Co-Op, near the GAA Sports Park, on Gurteen Road.

The Irish National War Memorial, Memorial Gardens and Park, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, are accessible from the Sarsfield Road via East Timor Park (also referred to by locals as &quot;The Gaels&quot; due to the local GAA club which is attached to the park).

Other parks located in the area include Le Fanu Park, Glenaulin Sports Park, Markievicz Park and Cherry Orchard Park. Le Fanu Park houses the Ballyfermot Leisure Centre and The Base.

===Grand Canal===

Due to the large amount of secondary schools in the area many merged into one which leaves Ballyfermot with two secondary schools: St Setons Secondary School and Kylemore College.

The merge between the secondary schools was necessitated due to a shortage of students between the schools.

Ballyfermot College of Further Education is a third-level institution based locally.

Another GAA club was present in the 1990s under the name St. Laurences GAA, which later merged with nearby Quarryvalle GAA in Clondalkin.

Ballyfermot De La Salle is the largest Gaelic football club in the area. The club, which originated in 1953 as Ballyfermot Gaels, play their senior home games in the Drumfin/Glenaulin Sports Park, located on the west side of California Hills Park. The club plays in the California Hills and Markievicz Park areas as well as in Glenaulin Park. The club&#x27;s colours are similar to that of Kerry, as a tribute to the first parish priest, Kerryman Charles Canon Troy, who sponsored the club.

Another club, Liffey Gaels, was founded in 1951. It was known as Rialto Gaels for over twenty years. In the 1970s, it changed its name to SS. Michael and James&#x27;s to reflect the association with these schools. In 1984, a local juvenile club, Donore Iosagain, amalgamated with SS. Michael and James&#x27;s and the club was renamed the Liffey Gaels. Today their immediate catchment area is Inchicore and the parishes of St Michael&#x27;s, St James&#x27;, St Catherine&#x27;s, Rialto and Donore Avenue. The Gaels play their home games Liffeyside at East Timor Park on Sarsfield Road in Inchicore.

<doc id="569117" wikidata="Q6665998" url="?curid=569117" title="Locomotives of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway">
<text>The London, Midland and Scottish Railway had the largest stock of steam locomotives of any of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; Grouping, i.e. pre-Nationalisation railway companies in the UK. Despite early troubles arising from factions within the new company, the LMS went on to build some very successful designs; many lasted until the end of steam traction on British Railways in 1968. For an explanation of numbering and classification, see British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification.

Various locomotives were inherited from pre-grouping companies. Those from the smaller railways, and hence non-standard, were withdrawn quite early, while ex-Midland, LNWR and L&amp;YR types persisted.

The Midland had long had a &#x27;small engine policy&#x27;, i.e. it preferred small engines hauling frequent, fairly short trains, and employing a second locomotive (double-heading) where necessary. Unfortunately this practice, while emininently suitable for the route from Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham to London was not at all suited to the route from Euston to Glasgow via Crewe, Preston and Carlisle (the &#x27;West Coast Main Line&#x27;) and it took several years to convince the senior staff responsible for such matters that this was the case.

The first sign of the change was the Royal Scot 4-6-0 class of 1927, officially designed by Fowler, but actually designed by the North British Locomotive Company with approval from Henry Fowler. Nevertheless, the majority of designs continued to be very much Midland in character.

This changed when William Stanier arrived. His large, streamlined &#x27;Princess Coronation&#x27; class engines were iconic and flew the flag for the LMS against the competing Class A4 of the London and North Eastern Railway.
== Locomotives acquired from constituent companies ==
See LMS locomotive numbering and classification for an explanation of the numbers allocated to inherited locomotives and the power classification system used below.

=== Ex-Midland Railway ===
The Midland shaped the subsequent LMS locomotive policy until 1933. Its locomotives (which it always referred to as engines) followed a corporate small engine policy, with numerous class 2F, 3F and 4F 0-6-0s for goods work, 2P and 4P 4-4-0s for passenger work, and 0-4-4T and 0-6-0T tank engines. The only exceptions to this were its 0-10-0 banking engine for Lickey Incline on its Bristol-Birmingham line, and the 7F 2-8-0 goods engines built by the Midland at their Derby locomotive works for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway.

===Ex-London and North Western Railway===

The LNWR did not have a significant impact on LMS policy as the Midland, although it did inspire the Fowler-built 7F.

===Ex-Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway===
===Ex-North Staffordshire Railway===

The North Staffordshire Railway handed over 192 standard gauge engines into the LMS capital stock.

In addition to the above, also added to the capital stock were the three NSR 0-2-2 railmotors numbered 1–3. These were not renumbered by the LMS before scrapping in 1927.

There were two other additions to the capital stock, the two locomotives of the narrow gauge Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway. These two engines, number 1 &quot;E.R. Calthrop&quot; and number 2 &quot;J.B. Earle&quot; kept both their names and numbers under the LMS.

Four locomotives were added to the LMS service stock. Standard gauge 0-4-0 battery electric locomotive, built in 1917, and three, gauge, 0-4-0ST locomotives called &quot;Frog&quot;, &quot;Toad&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; that worked the Caldon Low tramway, owned by the NSR. None of these locomotives were numbered by the LMS.

===Ex-Caledonian Railway===

The class number used for Caledonian Railway engines was the stock number of the first member of the class to reach traffic. Hence earlier numbered classes could well have appeared later in time.

===Ex-Furness Railway===

The Furness Railway was a small company with a correspondingly small locomotive stock. It is known best for the Baltic tanks (which seemed to be a little more successful than the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway examples of the same arrangement). The Baltics did not survive for long. The only class that survived as far as nationalisation were some moderate sized 0-6-0 tender engines classified &#x27;3F&#x27; by the LMS and as D5 by Bob Rush. Six were still in traffic as of 31 August 1948.

===Ex-Glasgow and South Western Railway===

===Ex-Highland Railway===
==Hughes (1923–1925)==

George Hughes, formerly of the L&amp;YR, became the first Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the LMS. However, he retired just two years later in 1925. His one new design was a class of mixed traffic moguls known as &quot;crabs&quot;.

* Class 5MT &quot;Crab&quot; 2-6-0
* Class 5P &quot;Dreadnought tank&quot; 4-6-4T, Designed for L&amp;YR, built by the LMS.

He also built small numbers of slightly modified versions of pre-grouping designs including:

* Caledonian Railway 60 Class
* Caledonian Railway 439 Class
* LT&amp;SR 79 Class

==Fowler (1925–1931)==
Sir Henry Fowler, deputy CME under Hughes, was formerly CME of the Midland Railway. He was largely responsible for the adoption of the Midland&#x27;s small engines as LMS standards. This led to a crisis as these were underpowered. However, some moves towards larger engines were made, particularly through the Royal Scots and Garratts. At the end of Fowler&#x27;s reign, Ernest Lemon briefly took over as CME, but was quickly promoted to make room for William Stanier.

* LMS Class 2P 4-4-0
* LMS Class 2F &quot;Dock Tank&quot; 0-6-0T
* LMS Class 3MT 2-6-2T
* LMS Class 3F &quot;Jinty&quot; 0-6-0T
* LMS Class 4P &quot;Compound&quot; 4-4-0
* LMS Class 4MT 2-6-4T
* LMS Class 4F &quot;Derby Four&quot; 0-6-0
* LMS Class 7F 0-8-0
* LMS Class 6P &quot;Patriot&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Class 7P &quot;Royal Scot&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Garratt 2-6-0+0-6-2
* LMS 6399 &quot;Fury&quot;

=== Stock taken in from the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ===

The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway was jointly owned by the LMS and the Southern with the LMS responsible for locomotive affairs. However, its locomotives were kept separate until 1928 when they were taken into LMS stock. These mostly consisted of standard Midland types constructed by the Midland and the LMS. The S&amp;DJR 7F 2-8-0, however, was specific to the line.

* S&amp;DJR 7F 2-8-0
* S&amp;DJR Sentinels
* and other Midland types.

==Stanier (1932–1944)==

William Stanier arrived in 1932 from the Great Western Railway and, with the backing of Josiah Stamp, reversed the small engine policy.

* LMS Class 2P 0-4-4T
* LMS Class 3MT 2-6-2T
* LMS Class 4MT 2-6-4T (two- and three-cylindered)
* LMS Class 5MT 2-6-0
* LMS Class 5MT &quot;Black Five&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Class 6P &quot;Jubilee&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Class 8P &quot;Princess Coronation&quot; 4-6-2
* LMS Class 8P &quot;Princess Royal&quot; 4-6-2
* LMS Class 8F 2-8-0
* LMS Turbomotive
* LMS Class 6P Rebuilt Jubilee
* LMS Class 7P Rebuilt Royal Scot

==Fairburn (1944–1945)==
Charles Fairburn was somewhat restricted by the rules applied to the railway companies by the war situation (not to mention the fact that Stanier had left things in a state that required little or no new design). He was responsible for the construction of a number of locomotives to Stanier designs (mainly the 8F 2-8-0 and 5MT 4-6-0) and some detailed design variations on the latter. He died of a heart attack in October 1945.
* LMS Class 4MT 2-6-4T

==Ivatt (1946–1947)==
George Ivatt, son of the former GNR CME Henry Ivatt, became CME in 1946. He continued building some Stanier types, but introduced some low-powered class 2 engines and a medium-powered class 4 mixed traffic design. A pair of main line diesels were also produced.

* LMS Class 2MT 2-6-0
* LMS Class 2MT 2-6-2T
* LMS Class 4MT 2-6-0
* NCC Class WT 2-6-4T, based on the Fowler 2-6-4T design of 1927.
* LMS Class 5MT &quot;Black Five&quot; 4-6-0 (modified version)
* LMS Class 6P &quot;Rebuilt Patriot&quot; 4-6-0
* LMS Class 8P &quot;Princess Coronation&quot; 4-6-2 (modified version)

==Modern Traction==
The LMS experimented with various forms of non-steam locomotives, and pioneered the use of diesel locomotives in Great Britain.
* LMS diesel locomotives
* LMS diesel shunters
** LMS diesel shunter 1831
* LMS petrol shunters
* LMS railcars

==Post-Nationalisation==
LMS locomotive design did not end in at Nationalisation in 1948, for it had enormous influence over the design of British Railways&#x27; &#x27;Standard&#x27; steam locomotives by former LMS man Robert Riddles. Some of the designs were little changed from the comparable designs by Ivatt.

Riddles built several examples of designs from the &#x27;Big Four&#x27;, including most of the Fairburn/Ivatt tank engines. These were distributed around the system, with many of the 2-6-2T designs going to the Southern Region.

==Withdrawal==
Pre-grouping types were withdrawn early for being non-standard, and locomotives were routinely withdrawn after their lives expired.

Withdrawal of locomotives generally did not take place until the great locomotive cull of British Railways in the period 1962–1966. A pair of &quot;Black Fives&quot; were the last steam locomotives to be run on British Railways in 1968, although since then there have been almost weekly charter runs for the enthusiast and tourist markets and the occasional timetabled service (for instance at Dawlish and Stratford-upon-Avon).

==Preservation==

A significant number of LMS locomotives have been preserved:

*Three LMS Hughes Crabs
*Nine LMS Class 3F &quot;Jinty&quot; 0-6-0Ts
*Three LMS Class 4F 0-6-0s
*Two LMS Royal Scot Class
*One LMS 3-Cylindered Stanier 2-6-4T
*One LMS Stanier Mogul
*Eighteen Black Fives
*Four LMS Jubilee Class
*Two LMS Princess Royal Class
*Three LMS Princess Coronation Class pacifics
*Twelve LMS Stanier Class 8Fs
*Two LMS Fairburn 2-6-4Ts
*Seven LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0s
*Four LMS Ivatt Class 2 2-6-2Ts
*One LMS Ivatt Class 4

A smaller number of pre-grouping locomotives inherited by the LMS have also been preserved.

<text>The Popular Front () was an alliance of left-wing movements in France, including the French Communist Party (PCF), the socialist SFIO and the Radical-Socialist Republican Party, during the interwar period. Three months after the victory of the Spanish Popular Front, the Popular Front won the May 1936 legislative election, leading to the formation of a government first headed by SFIO leader Léon Blum and composed of republican and SFIO ministers.

Blum&#x27;s government implemented various social reforms. The workers&#x27; movement welcomed this electoral victory by launching a general strike in May–June 1936, resulting in the negotiation of the Matignon Agreements, one of the cornerstones of social rights in France. All employees were assured a two-week paid vacation, and the rights of unions were strengthened. The socialist movement&#x27;s euphoria was apparent in SFIO member Marceau Pivert&#x27;s &quot;Tout est possible!&quot; (Everything is possible). However, the economy continued to stall, with 1938 production still not having recovered to 1929 levels, and higher wages had been neutralized by inflation. Businessmen took their funds overseas. Blum was forced to stop his reforms and devalue the franc. With the French Senate controlled by conservatives, Blum lost power in June 1937. The presidency of the cabinet was then taken over by Camille Chautemps, a Radical-Socialist, but Blum came back as President of the Council in March 1938, before being succeeded by Édouard Daladier, another Radical-Socialist, the next month. The Popular Front dissolved itself in autumn 1938, confronted by internal dissensions related to the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), opposition of the right-wing, and the persistent effects of the Great Depression.

After one year of major activity, it lost its spirit by June 1937 and could only temporize as the European crisis worsened. The Socialists were forced out; only the Radical-Socialists and smaller left-republican parties were left. It failed to live up to the expectations of the left. The workers obtained major new rights, but their 48 percent increase in wages was offset by a 46 percent rise in prices. Unemployment remained high, and overall industrial production was stagnant. Industry had great difficulty adjusting to the imposition of a 40-hour workweek, which caused serious disruptions while France was desperately trying to catch up with Germany in military production. France joined other nations and bitterly disappointed many French leftists in refusing to help the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, partly because the right threatened another civil war in France itself.

==Background==
There are various reasons for the formation of the Popular Front and its subsequent electoral victory, including the economic crisis caused by the Great Depression, which affected France starting in 1931, financial scandals and the instability of the Chamber of Deputies elected in 1932 that had weakened the ruling parties, the rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany, the growth of violent far-right leagues in France and in general of fascist-related parties and organisations (Marcel Bucard&#x27;s &quot;Mouvement franciste&quot;, which was subsidised by Italian leader Benito Mussolini, Neo-Socialism etc.)

The elections of 1932 had resulted in a victory for the two largest parties of the left, the Marxist SFIO and the Radical-Socialist PRRRS, as well as several smaller parties ideologically close to Radicalism (an electoral pact known as the Cartel des Gauches); the Communist Party had run on its own, accusing the Socialists of social-fascism and opposing the subsequent centre-left governments. However, major differences between the SFIO and PRRRS prevented them from forming a cabinet together, as all had expected, leaving France governed by a series of short-lived cabinets formed exclusively of the six Radical parties.
The Socialist Party reliably granted its confidence to these cabinets but fundamentally disagreed with their budget cuts, and the various small liberal centre-right parties who agreed with the budget cuts refused to support centre-left governments in which they were not represented. With government paralyzed, tensions grew greater and greater both between the different parties in parliament and within public opinion. The tensions finally erupted into the infamous 6 February 1934 crisis in which massive riots by authoritarian paramilitary leagues caused the collapse of the Cartel. The Radical-Socialists and other republican centre-left parties accepted entry into a government dominated by the centre-right (the liberal conservative Democratic Alliance) and hard right (the Catholic conservative Republican Federation). The support by extreme-right paramilitaries for the National Unity government alarmed the left, which feared that plans to reform the constitution would lead to the abandonment of parliamentary government for an authoritarian regime, as had recently occurred in other European democracies.

The idea of a &quot;Popular Front&quot; therefore came simultaneously from three directions:

* The frustration felt by many moderate Socialists and left-wing Radical-Socialists at the collapse of their previous attempts at government and an increasing desire to rebuild that coalition on a stronger basis to combat the economic crisis of the Great Depression
* The left-wing view that the 6 February 1934 riots had represented a deliberate attempt by the French far right for a coup d&#x27;état against the Republic 
* The Comintern&#x27;s alarm at the increased popularity of fascist and authoritarian right-wing regimes in Europe, and decision to abandon its hostile position towards social-democracy and parliamentarianism (see Third Period) in favour of the &quot;Popular Front&quot; position. This advocated an alliance with the social-democrats and authentically democratic middle-class republicans against the greater threat of the far-right.

Thus, antifascism became the order of the day for a growing number of Communists, Socialists and Republicans as a result of a convergence of influences: the collapse of the centre-left coalition of 1932, the fear of the consequences of the 1934 riots and the broader European policy of the Comintern. Maurice Thorez, secretary general of the SFIC, was the first to call for the formation of a &quot;Popular Front&quot;, first in the party press organ &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; in 1934 and then in the Chamber of Deputies. The Radical-Socialists were at the time the largest party in the Chamber, and had often been the dominant party of government during the second half of the Third Republic.

Beside the three main left-wing parties, Radical-Socialists, SFIO and PCF, the Popular Front was supported by several other parties and associations.

These included several civil society organisations, chief among whom were:

* The Confédération générale du travail (CGT) or General Confederation of Labour, a syndicalist trade-union confederation distinct from the Socialist and Communist parties;
* &quot;The Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (LDH) or League of Human Rights, a civil rights watchdog formed during the Dreyfus Affair;
* The Movement Against War and Fascism, a left-wing anti-war association that fell within the Communist sphere of influence;
* The &quot;Comité de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes&quot; (CVIA) or Vigilance Committee of Antifascist Intellectuals, a watchdog created in 1934 to organise resistance against a far-right takeover of the democratic regime.

The Communist, Socialist and Radical-Socialist parties were also joined by several smaller parties, mostly formed by dissidents who in previous years had exited the main three parties:

* The Socialist Republican Union (USR), a social-democratic republican party led by Paul Ramadier, Marcel Déat and Joseph Paul-Boncour. This had been formed by the fusion of the SFIO&#x27;s right-wing with the left-wing of the middle-class republicans;
* The Party of Proletarian Unity (PUP), a dissident Leninist party created in 1930 and opposed both to social democracy and to the Third International;
* The Frontist Party (PF), a small anti-fascist splinter of the Radical-Socialist Party formed by Gaston Bergery in 1933;
* The &quot;Parti radical-socialiste Camille Pelletan (PRS-CP),&quot; a small anti-fascist splinter of the Radical-Socialist Party formed in May 1934 by Gabriel Cudenet;
* The Parti de la Jeune République (PJR) or Young Republic party, a small Catholic anti-war party formed by Marc Sangnier;

== May 1936 elections and the formation of the Blum government ==

The Popular Front won the general election of 3 May 1936, with 386 seats out of 608. For the first time, the Socialists won more seats than the Radical-Socialists, and the Socialist leader, Léon Blum, became the first Socialist Prime Minister of France and the first Jew to hold that office. The first Popular Front cabinet consisted of 20 Socialists, 13 Radical-Socialists and two Socialist Republicans (there were no Communist Ministers) and, for the first time, included three women (who were then not able to vote in France).

The members of the Popular Front parties too small to form their own parliamentary grouping (the PUP, PF, PRS-CP and PJR) joined with several independents to sit together as the Independent Left (&quot;Gauche indépendante&quot;) parliamentary caucus.

==In government==

===Labor laws===
Through the 1936 Matignon Accords, the Popular Front government introduced new labor laws that did the following:
* created the right to strike
* created collective bargaining
* enacted the law mandating 12 days (two weeks) of paid annual leave for workers
* enacted the law limiting the working week to 40 hours; Overtime was prohibited
* raised workers&#x27; wages (15% for the lowest-paid and 7% for the relatively well-paid)
* stipulated that employers would recognise shop stewards
* ensured that there would be no retaliation against strikers

The government sought to carry out its reforms as rapidly as possible. On 11 June, the Chamber of Deputies voted for the forty-hour workweek, the restoration of civil servants&#x27; salaries, and two weeks&#x27; paid holidays, by a majority of 528 to 7. The Senate voted in favour of these laws within a week.

===Domestic reforms===
The Blum administration democratised the Bank of France by enabling all shareholders to attend meetings and set up a new council with more representation from government. By mid-August the parliament had passed:
* the creation of a national &quot;Office du blé&quot; (Grain Board or Wheat Office, through which the government helped to market agricultural produce at fair prices for farmers) to stabilise prices and curb speculation
* the nationalisation of the arms industries
* loans to small and medium-sized industries
* the raising of the compulsory school-leaving age to 14 years
* measures against illicit price rises
* a major public works program

The legislative pace of the Popular Front government meant that before parliament went into recess, it had passed 133 laws within the space of 73 days, a pace of nearly two enactments a day.

Other measures carried out by the Popular Front government improved the pay, pensions, allowances, and taxes of public-sector workers and ex-servicemen. The 1920 sales tax, opposed by the Left as a tax on consumers, was abolished and replaced by a production tax, which was considered to be a tax on the producer instead of the consumer. The government also made some administrative changes to the civil service, such as a new director-general for the Paris police and a new governor for the Bank of France. In addition, a secretariat for sports and leisure was established, and opportunities for the children of workers and peasants in secondary education were increased. In 1937, careers guidance classes (&quot;classes d&#x27;orientation&quot;) were established in some lycées as a means of helping pupils to make a better choice of their subsequent course of secondary schooling. Secondary education was made free to all pupils; previously, it had been closed to the poor, who were unable to afford to pay tuition.

In aviation, a decree in December 1936 established a psycho-physiological service for military aviation &quot;with the task of centralising the study of the adaptation of the human system to the optimum utilisation of aeronautical material.&quot; A Decree of 12 July 1936 extended compensation to cover diseases contracted in sewers, skin diseases due to the action of cement, dermatitis due to the action of trichloronaphthaline (acne), and cutaneous and nasal ulceration from potassium bichromate. An Act of August 1936 extended to workers in general supplementary allowances that had previously been confined to workers injured in accidents prior to 9 January 1927. An order dealing with rescue equipment in mines was issued on 19 August 1936, followed by two orders concerning packing and caving on 25 February 1937. In relation to maritime transport, a Decree of 3 March 1937 issued instructions concerning safety. A decree of 18 June 1937 promulgated the Convention &quot;concerning the marking of the weight on heavy packages transported by vessels which was adopted by the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1929&quot;.

In October 1936, the government ratified a League of Nations Convention dating back to October 1933, which granted Nansen refugees &quot;travel and identity documents that afforded them protection against arbitrary &quot;refoulement&quot; and expulsion.&quot; The Walter-Paulin Law of March 1937 set standards for apprenticeship teachers and set up a corps of salaried inspectors, while a decree of June 1937 decided on the &quot;creation of the workshop schools, close to schools [...] that should awaken the skills and curiosity of students, open up more to life school work, let them know about the local history and geography.&quot; In June 1937, holiday camps (‘colonies’) received a nationwide public statute through their first comprehensive state regulation.

An act of 26 August 1936 that amended the social insurance scheme for commerce and industry raised the maximum daily maternity benefit from 18 to 22 francs, and an order of 13 February 1937 prescribed a special sound signal for road-rail coaches. Improvements were made in unemployment allowances, and an Act of August 1936 increased the rate of pensions and allowances payable to miners and their dependents. In August 1936, regulations extending the provisions of the Family Allowances Act to agriculture were signed into law. A decree was introduced that same month for the inspection of farm dwellings, and at the beginning of January 1937, an Advisory Committee on Rents was appointed by decree. To promote profit-sharing, an Act of January 1937 (that regulated the working of the State mines, the Alsatian potash mines, and the potash industry), provided that 10% of the net yield of the undertaking &quot;must be set aside, to be used, at least to the extent of one half, to enable the staff to share in the profits of the industry.&quot;

Blum persuaded the workers to accept pay raises and go back to work, ending the massive wave of strikes that disrupted production in 1936. Wages increased sharply, in two years the national average was up 48 percent. However inflation also rose 46%. The imposition of the 40-hour week proved highly inefficient, as industry had a difficult time adjusting to it. At the end of 40 hours, a shop or small factory had to shut down or replace its best workers; unions refused to compromise on this issue. The limitation was ended by the Radicals in 1938. The economic confusion hindered the rearmament effort; the rapid growth of German armaments alarmed Blum. He launched a major program to speed up arms production. The cost forced the abandonment of the social reform programs that the Popular Front had counted heavily on.

===Far right===
Blum dissolved the far-right leagues. In turn, the Popular Front was actively fought by right-wing and far-right movements, which often used antisemitic slurs against Blum and other Jewish ministers. The Cagoule far-right group even staged bombings to disrupt the government.

===Spanish Civil War===
The Spanish Civil War broke out in July 1936 and deeply divided the government, which tried to remain neutral. The French left massively supported the Republican government in Madrid, and the right mostly supported the Nationalist insurgents, some even threatening to bring the war to France. Blum&#x27;s cabinet was also deeply divided. Fear of the war spreading to France was one factor that made him decide on a policy of non-intervention. He collaborated with Britain and 25 other countries to formalize an agreement against sending any munitions or volunteer soldiers to Spain.

The air minister defied the cabinet and secretly sold warplanes to Madrid. Jackson concludes that the French government &quot;was virtually paralyzed by the menace of Civil War at home, the German danger abroad, and the weakness of her own defenses.&quot; The Republicans in Spain found themselves increasingly on the defensive, and over 500,000 political refugees crossed the border into France, where they lived for years in refugee camps.

===Collapse===
After 1937, the precarious coalition went into its death throes with rising extremism on left and right, as well as bitter recriminations. The economy remained stagnant, and French policy became helpless in the face of rapid growth of the German threat.

By 1938, the Radicals had taken control and forced the Socialists out of the cabinet. In late 1938, the Communists broke with the coalition by voting against the Munich agreement, in which the Popular Front had joined with the British by handing over part of Czechoslovakia to Germany. The government denounced the Communists as warmongers, who provoked large-scale strikes in late 1938. The Radical government crushed the Communists and fired over 800,000 workers. In effect, the Radical Party stood alone.

== Cultural policies ==
Radical cultural ideas came to the fore in the era of the Popular Front and often were explicitly supported by the governments, as in the 1937 Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne.

An &quot;art for the masses&quot; movement flourished, led by efforts of three of the most influential art magazines to legitimize a visual imagery: &quot;Cahiers d&#x27;art,&quot; &quot;Minotaure,&quot; and &quot;Verve.&quot; The prevailing leftist anti-capitalist discourse against social inequality was a feature of the Popular Front cultural policy.

The government proposed a draft law concerning intellectual property right, based on a new philosophy that did not consider the author as an &quot;owner&quot; (&quot;propriétaire&quot;) but as an &quot;intellectual worker&quot; (&quot;travailleur intellectuel&quot;). However, the draft failed to pass.

==New communist positions ==
The new cross-class coalition of the Popular Front forced the Communists to accept some bourgeois cultural norms that they had long ridiculed. These included patriotism, the veterans&#x27; sacrifice, the honor of being an army officer, the prestige of the bourgeois, and the leadership of the Socialist Party and the parliamentary Republic. Above all, the Communists portrayed themselves as French nationalists. Young Communists dressed in costumes from the revolutionary period and the scholars glorified the Jacobins as heroic predecessors.

The Communists in the 1920s saw the need to mobilize young women but saw them as auxiliaries to male organizations. The 1930s had a new model of a separate-but-equal role for women. The party set up the Union des Jeunes Filles de France (UJFF) to appeal to young working women through publications and activities that were geared to their interests. The party discarded its original notions of Communist femininity and female political activism as a gender-neutral revolutionary. It issued a new model more attuned to the mood of the late 1930s and one more acceptable to the middle class elements of the Popular Front. It now portrayed the ideal young Communist woman as a paragon of moral probity with her commitment to marriage and motherhood and gender-specific public activism.

== Sports and leisure ==
With the 1936 Matignon Accords, the working class gained the right to two weeks&#x27; vacation a year for the first time. This signaled the beginning of tourism in France. Although beach resorts had long existed, they had been restricted to the upper class. Tens of thousands of families who had never seen the sea before now played in the waves, and Léo Lagrange arranged around 500,000 discounted rail trips and hotel accommodation on a massive scale. However, the Popular Front&#x27;s policy on leisure was limited to the enactment of the two-week vacation. While this measure was thought of as a response to workers&#x27; alienation, the Popular Front gave Lagrange (SFIO), named Under-Secretary for Sports and the organisation of Leisure, responsibility for organizing the use this leisure time with priority to sports.

The fascist conception and use of sport as a means to an end contrasted with the SFIO&#x27;s official stance, which had ridiculed sports as a bourgeois and reactionary activity. However, confronted with an increasing possibility of war with Nazi Germany and affected by the scientific racist theories of the time, which were common beyond the fascist parties, the SFIO began to change its ideas concerning sports during the Popular Front, because its social reforms permitted to the workers&#x27; to participate in such leisure activities and also because of the increasing risks of a confrontation with Nazi Germany, particularly after the March 1936 remilitarization of the Rhineland. That new sign of German&#x27;s revisionism towards the conditions of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles violated the 1925 Locarno Treaties, which had been reaffirmed in 1935 by France, Britain and Italy, allied in the Stresa Front. That led parts of the SFIO in supporting a conception of sport used as a training field for future conscription and, eventually, war.

The complex situation did not stop Lagrange from holding fast to an ethical conception of sports that rejected fascist militarism and indoctrination, scientific racist theories and the professionalisation of sports, which he opposed as an elitist conception that ignored the main popular aspect of sport. He considered that sport should aim for the fulfilment of the personality of the individual. Thus, Lagrange stated, &quot;It cannot be a question in a democratic country of militarizing the distractions and the pleasures of the masses and of transforming the joy skillfully distributed into a means of not thinking.&quot; Léo Lagrange further declared in 1936:

&quot;Our simple and human goal is to allow the masses of French youth to find in the practice of sport, joy and health and to build an organization of the leisure activities so that the workers can find relaxation and a reward to their hard labour.&quot;

Langrange also explained:

&quot;We want to make our youth healthy and happy. Hitler has been very clever at that sort of thing, and there is no reason why a democratic government should not do the same.&quot;

Thus, as shown by the hierarchy of the ministers, which placed the sub-secretary of sport under the authority of the Minister of Public Health, sport was considered above all as a public health issue. From this principle, it was only one step to relating sport to the &quot;degeneration of the race&quot; and other scientific racist theories. It was done by Georges Barthélémy, deputy of the SFIO, who declared that sports contributed to the &quot;improvement of relations between capital and labour, henceforth to the elimination of the concept of class struggle&quot; and that they were a &quot;means to prevent the moral and physical degeneration of the race.&quot;

Such corporatist conceptions had led to the neo-socialist movement, whose members had been excluded from the SFIO on 5 November 1933. However, scientific racist positions were upheld inside the SFIO and the Radical-Socialist Party, who supported colonialism and found in this discourse a perfect ideological alibi to justify colonial rule. After all, Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), a leading theorist of scientific racism, had been a SFIO member, although he was strongly opposed to the &quot;Teachers&#x27; Republic&quot; (&quot;République des instituteurs&quot;) and its meritocratic ideal of individual advancement and fulfillment through education, a Republican ideal founded on the philosophy of the Enlightenment.

=== 1936 Olympic Games ===

The International Olympic Committee chose Berlin over Barcelona for the 1936 Olympic Games. In protest against holding the event in a fascist country, the Spanish Popular Front, decided to organize rival games in Barcelona, under the name People&#x27;s Olympiad. Blum&#x27;s government at first decided to take part in it, on insistence from the PCF, but the games were never held because the Spanish Civil War broke out.

Léo Lagrange played a major role in the co-organisation of the People&#x27;s Olympiad. The trials for these Olympiads proceeded on 4 July 1936 in the Pershing stadium in Paris. Through their club, the FSGT, or individually, 1,200 French athletes were registered with these anti-fascist Olympiads.

However, Blum finally decided not to vote for the funds to pay the athletes&#x27; expenses. A PCF deputy declared: &quot;Going to Berlin is making oneself an accomplice of the torturers...&quot; Nevertheless, on 9 July, when the whole of the French right wing voted for the participation of France in the Olympic Games of Berlin, the left wing (PCF included) abstained. The motion passed, and France participated at Berlin.

=== 1937 Million Franc Race ===

In 1937, the Popular Front organized the Million Franc Race to induce automobile manufacturers to develop race cars capable of competing with the German Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union racers of the time, which were backed by the Nazi government as part of its sports policy. Hired by Delahaye, René Dreyfus beat Jean-Pierre Wimille, who ran for Bugatti. Wimille would later take part in the Resistance. The next year, Dreyfus succeeded in overwhelming the legendary Rudolf Caracciola, and his Silver Arrow at the Pau Grand Prix, becoming a national hero.

==Colonial policy==
The Popular Front initiated the 1936 Blum-Viollette proposal, which was supposed to grant French citizenship to a minority of Algerian Muslims. Opposed both by &quot;colons&quot; and by Messali Hadj&#x27;s pro-independence party, the project was never submitted to the National Assembly&#x27;s vote and was abandoned.

==Legacy==
Many historians judge the Popular Front to be a failure in terms of economics, foreign policy and long-term stability. &quot;Disappointment and failure,&quot; says Jackson, &quot;was the legacy of the Popular Front.&quot; Philippe Bernard and Henri Dubief concluded, &quot;The Front Populaire came to grief through its own economic ineffectiveness and because of external pressures over which it had no control.&quot; There is general agreement that at first it created enormous excitement and expectation on the left, but in the end, it failed to live up to its promise. There is also general agreement, that the Popular Front provided a set of lessons and even an inspiration for the future. It began a process of government intervention into economic affairs that grew rapidly during the Vichy and postwar regimes into the modern French welfare state.

Charles Sowerwine argues that the Popular Front was above all a coalition against fascism, and it succeeded in blocking the arrival of fascism in France until 1940. He adds that it &quot;failed to make the great changes its supporters anticipated and left many ordinary French people deeply disillusioned.&quot;

The reasons for the failure continue to be debated. Many historians blame Blum for being too timid and thereby dissolving the revolutionary fervor of the workers. MacMillan says that Blum &quot;Lacked the inner convictions that he was the man to resolve the country&#x27;s problems by bold and imaginative leadership,&quot; leading him to avoid a showdown with the financial powers, and forfeiting the support of the working class.

Other scholars blame the complex coalition of Socialist and Radicals, who never really agreed on labor policy. Others point to the Communists, who refused to turn the general strike into a revolution, as well as their refusal to join the government. From the perspective of the far left, &quot;The failure of the Popular Front government was the failure of the parliamentary system,&quot; says Allen Douglas.

Economic historians point to numerous bad financial and economic policies, such as delayed devaluation of the franc, which made French exports uncompetitive. Economists especially consider the bad effects of the 40-hour week, which made overtime illegal, forcing employers to choose whether stop work or to replace their best workers with inferior and inexperienced workers when 40 hours had been reached. More generally, the argument is made that France could not afford the labor reforms in the face of poor economic conditions, the fears of the business community, and the threat of Nazi Germany. The forty hour week was particularly problematic in light of German weapons production - France was trying to compete with a nation which not only had a larger population but one which was working fifty to sixty hour work weeks. The limits on working hours particularly limited aircraft production, weakening French aviation and thus encouraging concessions at the Munich Agreement.

==Composition of Léon Blum&#x27;s government (June 1936 – June 1937)==

<text>Johann Deisenhofer (; born September 30, 1943) is a German biochemist who, along with Hartmut Michel and Robert Huber, received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1988 for their determination of the first crystal structure of an integral membrane protein, a membrane-bound complex of proteins and co-factors that is essential to photosynthesis.

==Early life and education==

Born in Bavaria, Deisenhofer earned his doctorate from the Technical University of Munich for research work done at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, West Germany, in 1974. He conducted research there until 1988, when he joined the scientific staff of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the faculty of the Department of Biochemistry at The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.

==Career==
Together with Michel and Huber, Deisenhofer determined the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This membrane protein complex, called a photosynthetic reaction center, was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used X-ray crystallography to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis and revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria.

Deisenhofer currently serves on the board of advisors of Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. He is currently a professor at the Department of Biophysics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

<doc id="569126" wikidata="Q3336126" url="?curid=569126" title="Narromine">
<text>Narromine () is a rural Australian town located approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) west of Dubbo in the Orana region of New South Wales. The town is at the centre of Narromine Shire. The 2021 census recorded a population of 3,507.  Narromine holds strong historical ties to the Australian Military, as it was the location of RAAF No.19 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD) during World War II. The base contributed to the preparation of troops through a training organisation known as the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The town was one of twelve locations for the No.5 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF in 1940.

The town and its district was formed on traditional Wiradjuri country, one of the largest Indigenous populations in central New South Wales. The Macquarie River passes through the town. The Mitchell Highway, named after the early explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell, is the main road from Dubbo to the West and also passes through Narromine. Prior to settlement in the early 1800s, Wiradjuri tribes occupied much of the land between Wambool/Wambuul (renamed the Macquarie River by late settlers), the Kalar (the Lachlan River) and the Murrumbidgerie (Murrumbidgee River). In December 2021, the NSW government restored its traditional name and formally assigned the name Wambuul to the riverbed of the Macquarie River. The term Wambuul means &#x27;winding river&#x27; in Wiradjuri language and both names are recognised with equal status.

Narromine district has a history of flooding, with the largest flood recorded in 1926. Multiple plant and animal species are found within the Narromine district and is home to many iconic Australian species. Situated in the Murray-Darling Basin region, Narromine&#x27;s agricultural land is used for many dryland and irrigated agricultural activities. Although Narromine is one of the main growing regions for cotton in the Central West district of New South Wales, the production of beans, wheat and grain, as well as livestock products including wool, mutton, lamb and beef are all common. The Burrendong Dam has facilitated irrigation schemes that have greatly aided local agriculture in the town and its surrounding districts. The town&#x27;s rural history has organically bought tourism to the area, with the Narromine Aviation Museum, Aero Club and Mungery Picnic Races being highlight attractions. Rugby teams are represented by the Narromine Jets and Narromine Gorillas.

==History==
The town name comes from a pastoral property, which in turn came from the Wiradjuri word &#x27;ngarru-mayiny&#x27; meaning &#x27;honey people&#x27;. The land lay within Wangaibon territory.
The first European to visit the district was John Oxley who traced the course of the Macquarie River in 1818.The Main West railway line extension between Dubbo and Nevertire, which included Narromine, was officially opened on 20 October 1882. The town was established after the railway opened, the first structures in the town being the railway platforms. The township was gazetted in 1883, and the railway station opened on 1 May 1883. It was renamed to its current spelling in October 1889. &quot;Narramine&quot; Post Office opened on 20 October 1882 and was renamed &quot;Narromine&quot; in November 1900. The village of Narramine was proclaimed in July 1883, and numerous buildings followed, including the police station built in 1890, the store (1890) and the Royal Hotel (1890). A bridge over the Macquarie River was built in 1897. After federation, the population of Narromine was 2,228 in the 1911 census, and in 1947 the population was 1,816.

=== Early history and settlement ===
Early history reports that British explorer and surveyor of Australia John Oxley, was the first man to pass by the site of the town of Narromine in June 1818. From a study of the map showing his route, Oxley set out with boats and horses to trace the course of the Macquarie River, that ran directly through the Narromine district during the early 1800s. From 1818 onwards, other notable explorations by Robert Dixon, Major Mitchell and Captain Charles Sturt. In later years, the land became settled and the land became property of the Crown, meaning that is belonged to the monarch. Today, Crown land under Commonwealth territories are separate to the monarch&#x27;s private estate and is deemed public land to Australia. However, in Narromine during 1844, squatters began to take possession of extensive areas of Crown land that lead to a list of licence holders of property (known as the Government Gazette of 1848). Most notably, William Charles Wentworth was the first landowner of formally named &quot;Narramine&quot;.

The following stations were first retained by landowners as a part of the Government Gazette of 1848:

* &quot;Terramungamine&quot; and &quot;Burroway&quot; – E. Brook Cornish
* &quot;Minore&quot; – Benajamin Boyd
* &quot;Graddell&quot; – J. Corse
* &quot;Mungery&quot; – John Dargin
* &quot;Bulgandramine&quot; and &quot;Tomingley&quot; – J. Gilmore
* &quot;Wallanbillan&quot; – Samuel Phillips
* &quot;Timbrebungan&quot; – Robert Smith
* &quot;Euromedah&quot; or &quot;Mount Park&quot;, &quot;Weemabah&quot; and &quot;Gunningbar&quot; – Saul Samuel

=== The Court House Hotel ===
Situated on the corner of Burraway Street and Merilba Street, the Court House Hotel was initially established by David Fitch in 1889 and originally opened as Fitch&#x27;s Court House Hotel.

=== Narromine in literature ===
The town of Narromine is featured in the famous work of Banjo Patterson, The City of Dreadful Thirst published originally in 1889. The poem references the town exactly nine times and satirically narrates the culture of the people of Narromine as well as the floods, dusty plains and landscape of the town. The poem is found within the Collective Versus of A.B Patterson and is 48 lines long.

&quot;The stranger came from Narromine and made his little joke⁠—&quot;

&quot;&quot;They say we folks in Narromine are narrow-minded folk.&quot;

&quot;But all the smartest men down here are puzzled to define&quot;

&quot;A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narromine&quot;.
=== Military history ===

During World War II, Narromine was the location of RAAF No.19 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 14 June 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

==== World War II Empire Air Training Scheme ====
Australia contributed to the preparation of troops for World War II and provided a training organisation known as the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The outbreak of war in Europe, 1939, saw the RAAF headquarters in Melbourne, Australia launch a plan to provide basic training to 28,000 aircrew over a three-year agreement. The facilitation of this training scheme produced forty schools in air navigation, bombing and gunnery, flying, and technical training for ground staff, come to fruition in the late 1930s. Narromine is listed as one of twelve locations for the training scheme as No.5 Elementary Flying Training School RAAF formed in 1940.

== Indigenous history ==
Wiradjuri country is one of the largest Indigenous populations in central New South Wales and are traditional owners of the land in the Narromine district. Skilled in hunting and gathering, Wiradjuri tribes occupied much of the land between Wambool/Wambuul (renamed the Macquarie River by late settlers), the Kalar (the Lachlan River) and the Murrumbidgerie (Murrumbidgee River). Early European settlers appropriated Wiradjuri country from the 1820s, with the early establishment of the village of Dubbo in 1849, 52 km east of Narromine.

For hundreds of years, the Macquarie River has been the homeland for many Wiradjuri tribes. However, for the past 200 years, its indigenous name &quot;Wambuul&quot; has been an excluded point of reference for the winding waterway. In December 2021, the NSW government restored its traditional name and formally assigned the name Wambuul to the riverbed. The process was brought about by the Bathurst Local Aboriginal Land Council (BLALC) in 2020 and became immediately into effect. The towns situated on and around the Macquarie/Wambuul River including Narromine, will now use the names individually or combined as both are recognised with equal status. The term Wambuul means &#x27;winding river&#x27; in Wiradjuri language.

== Geography ==

=== The Narromine Shire ===
There are a variety of small towns situated on the outskirts of the town but are within the Narromine district that make up the Narromine Shire local government. They are well-known areas to the Narromine community, as many residents travel and reside between towns on farms.

The main four neighbouring towns include:

* Tomingley (approximately 37 km South of Narromine along the Newell Highway)
* Trangie (approximately 46 km North-West of Narromine along the Mitchell Highway)
* Burroway (approximately 34 km North of Narromine along the McGrane Way)
* Dandaloo (approximately 65 km West of Narromine along Dandaloo Road)

=== Floods ===
Due to its proximity to the Macquarie River, the Narromine township has parts which are flood liable. In late March 1926, Narromine experienced its biggest flood since 1893, with the Macquarie River peaking at at 5 am on 27 March. Narromine was isolated due to floodwaters cutting roads, telephone lines and the railway line. A large area of country around the town was covered in water. Very little damage was reported.
In the floods of April 1990, the river peaked at Narromine at a record .

=== Flora ===
Multiple plant species are found within the Narromine district with some iconic Australian species noted for the area below:

* Grey Box Eucalyptus
* Leopardwood Tree
* False Sandalwood
* Old Man Saltbush
* River Red Gum
* Wilga Shrub
* Weeping Myall

=== Fauna ===
Narromine is home to many native Australian wildlife with some species noted below:

* Pied Butcherbird
* Short-beaked Echidna
* Barking Owl
* Black Falcon
* Weebill
* Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater
* Grey-crowned Babbler
* Magpie Goose
* Spotted Harrier
* Eastern Blue-tongue Lizard
* Murray Cod

== Agricultural practices ==
Situated in the Murray-Darling Basin region, Narromine&#x27;s agricultural land is used for many dryland agricultural activities to remain adaptable when the rainfall is absent in a given cropping cycle. The production of beans, wheat and grain, as well as livestock products including wool, mutton, lamb and beef are all common agricultural practices in the Narromine district. Like many towns of the Central West region of New South Wales, traditionally the area is known to have adopted hybrid farming systems to integrate both cropping and livestock. This transition into hybrid farming was caused by the industrial revolution of the industry and technological advances.

=== Cotton farming ===
Narromine is one of the main growing regions for cotton in the Central West district of New South Wales, Australia, with irrigation agricultural activities remaining a major contributor to the area&#x27;s economy. Cotton is a natural fibre, planted in spring, grown over summer and harvested in autumn for the region, cotton farming requires irrigated watering systems that are controlled. The production levels of cotton in Narromine, are dependent on water availability, with the quality of harvest reflected in rainfall and fluctuating river levels. Cotton in the area is produced from a variety of irrigation methods including flood irrigation, drip irrigation, spray irrigation and others. The Burrendong Dam was built between 1946 and 1967, which facilitated irrigation schemes that have greatly aided local agriculture in the town and its surrounding districts. Cotton farming came to the area as a result of advances in knowledge and technology/machinery around irrigation and utilising the water available from the surrounding water catchments.

==Economy==
Agriculture, including sheep, cattle, wool, cereal and cotton production, has long been a central feature of the local economy. The town also has &quot;major commercial nurseries and research facilities&quot; supporting &quot;the national forestry and vegetable industries&quot;. In 2014 gold mining commenced at nearby Tomingley.

== Tourism ==

=== Narromine Aviation Museum and Aero Club ===
With records of flights from Narromine dating back to early 1919, Narromine is known for Australia&#x27;s longest standing aero club, with recorded flights dating back to 1919. The Aero Club was established ten years later in 1929. In 1935, commercial flights from Sydney to Narromine commenced for a limited number of passengers. The introduction of a small airline was celebrated at the time, with records showing the first fifty passengers published in newspapers weeks later to gain traction on the occasion. It has developed to international standards of flying, with planes transporting rural citizens daily to main Australian cities and towns. The plans to build the Narromine Aviation Museum begun in the early 1990s, with a committee forming and a National Tourism Development Program grant secured. The museum opened its doors in October 2002, with Australian aviator Nancy-Bird Walton launching the ceremony. The museum facilitates an auditorium to its local community, with a 200-person seating capacity available to hire for town events and meetings. It exhibits long standing and related artefacts, photographs, documents and records to the history of the towns influence in World War II. The museum is home to three distinct and well recognised aircraft including:

* A flyable replica of the 1907 Wright Flyer Model A (2005)
* An original Corben Super Ace homebulit (1938)
* An original Hawkridge Venture glider (1953)

=== Narromine Gliding Club ===
The Narromine Gliding Club remains a popular destination for glider pilots, often hosting state, national and international-level gliding competitions.

In December 2015, the Narromine Gliding Club was host to the 9th FAI Junior World Gliding Championships in Club and Standard classes. The Standard class was won by Australian Matthew Scutter. 

In December 2023, the Narromine Gliding Club was host to the 37th FAI World Gliding Championships in Club, Standard and 15m classes. The Club class was won by Australian James Nugent.

=== Mungery picnic races ===
Held annually on the outskirts of Narromine and on the banks of the Bogan River, is the Mungery Picnic horse racing. Traditional to Australian country races, are events such fashion in the field that includes best dressed lady, best dressed man, best dressed couple and best dressed juniors. Events such as race auctions, dash for cash activities, bookmakers and betting, as well as children&#x27;s entertainment, food and drink services are also provided at the Mungery Picnic Races.

==Population==

According to the 2021 census, the population Narromine was 3,507.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 24.9% of the population. 
* 80.3% of people were born in Australia and 83.7% of people spoke only English at home
* The most common responses for religion were Catholic 24.9%, No Religion 23.1% and Anglican 20.1%.

==Personalities==

The town of Narromine has produced several success stories, most recently sports personalities Glenn McGrath (Australian cricket team: Fast bowler) and Melinda Gainsford-Taylor (Sprinter: Commonwealth Games medallist), Disney animator Adam Phillips and North Queensland Cowboys rugby league player Justin Smith. Other notable sportsmen to represent Australia at the International level include David Gillespie (Australian Rugby League) and David Jansen (International Gliding Championships).

The 1958 Melbourne Cup Winner, Baystone, was owned by the Burns family from Narromine: Robert Burns, and his two sons Norman and Noel.

A statue of Glenn McGrath was installed in Tom Perry Park in 2009.

==Sporting teams==
Narromine is involved in regional sporting competitions.

In Rugby League, Narromine is represented by the Narromine Jets in the Group 11 Country Rugby League competition. Narromine has had a significant amount of success in this competition. Particularly, in 2002/2003 when their U18&#x27;s took out the Group 11 competition with relative ease. The team defeated Dubbo CYMS in the 2002 grand final after completing the regular season undefeated. In 2003 the team lost only one game before defeating Dubbo Macquarie Raiders in 
a one sided affair.

Rugby League team:
* Narromine Jets

The town also boasts a successful Rugby Union team known as the Narromine Gorillas. Founded in 1982, the Gorillas have been a major force across the central west competitions and currently compete in the Blowes Clothing Cup.
The Gorillas had a successful 2017 season in which they won the Graincorp cup (north) without tasting defeat the entire year. The Grand Final saw them take on the Molong Magpies, with the final score being 31–10.
Despite winning the premiership, the most significant achievement of 2017 might&#x27;ve been the reclaiming of &quot;The Ashes&quot; from cross shire rivals the Trangie Tigers. The infamous urn had never been held by Narromine in the 33 years since its inception, and this was the first time it had been contested since 1994.
Prior to this recent success the first grade side won the 2009 Blowes Cup defeating the Bathurst Bulldogs in the grand final, and also registered three straight minor premierships from 2009 to 2011.
As well as senior teams, the Gorillas has a fantastic junior rugby program with U/13&#x27;s, U/15&#x27;s and U/17&#x27;s teams, plus sub-juniors.

<text>Langebaanweg is a town on the southwest coast of South Africa, in Western Cape Province.

It is the location of the air force base AFB Langebaanweg. 

Langebaanweg has been an important mining center, with its main minerals consisting of phosphorites, primarily calcium phosphate. The mining uncovered fossils dating from the late Miocene and early Pliocene, approximately 5 million years ago. Fossil species found there include invertebrates and also a type of rhinoceros, as well as a mousebird and a diving petrel. The West Coast Fossil Park includes displays of fossils found in a former phosphate mine. Brett Hendey, formally of the Iziko South African Museum, documented the significance of the Langebaanweg fossil sites.

Langebaanweg is also notable as the birthplace of former England cricketer Allan Lamb, who played 79 Tests for his adopted country as well as in the 1987 and 1992 Cricket World Cup Finals.

<text>Labour Students is a student organisation within the Labour Party of the United Kingdom. It is a network of affiliated college and university clubs, known as Labour Clubs, who campaign in their campuses and communities for Labour&#x27;s values of equality and social justice.

Labour Students’ main activities include providing political education and training to its members, sending activists to by-elections and marginal constituencies across the country and organising politically within the National Union of Students and Student Unions.

Labour Students was disaffiliated from the Labour Party by the Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee in September 2019, with the intent of replacing it with a new student organisation. Although campaigning activity continued to be organised under the Labour Students branding during the 2019 general election, the organisation subsequently ceased to exist.

A new, refounded National Labour Students (NLS) was passed at the 2021 Labour Party Conference. National Committee elections were held in August 2022 and Ben McGowan was elected as the inaugural chair of the organisation on 2 September 2022.

== History ==
The Labour Party&#x27;s first organisation for students was the National Association of Labour Student Organisations (NALSO), which was founded in 1946 but had its recognition by the party withdrawn in 1967 after it was taken over by supporters of the Trotskyist Socialist Labour League. While the Scottish organisation continued, the Labour Party was left without a national student body.

In 1970, some Labour supporters created Students for a Labour Victory, a group intended to coordinate campaigning in the general election that year. That group then became the National Organisation of Labour Students (NOLS), which held its founding conference in 1971. Despite changing its name in the early 1990s, the current body, Labour Students, is still sometimes referred to by the acronym NOLS.

In its early years, NOLS was divided between two factions — members of the entryist Militant group and a mainstream left group, associated with the Tribune group of Labour MPs, which formed in January 1974 called Clause Four, after the central political statement of the Labour Party constitution. Militant controlled NOLS from January 1974 to December 1975. Members of NOLS in the 1970s included future parliamentarians Charles Clarke, Bill Speirs, Peter Mandelson, Sally Morgan, Mike Gapes, Mike Jackson, Nigel Stanley, Margaret Curran and Johann Lamont.

During Tony Blair&#x27;s premiership, Labour Students opposed the Government&#x27;s planned introduction of university &quot;top-up&quot; fees. Labour Students were broadly supportive of Gordon Brown&#x27;s government.

In 2016, the national conference adopted a one-member-one-vote (OMOV) system for internal elections, through an amendment of its constitution. However many member clubs perceived this as being implemented incompletely and slowly, with accusations of vote-rigging in 2019. In the early 2019 Labour Students leadership election there were 507 eligible voters, out of a claimed approximately 30,000 Labour Party student members. As a consequence, about half of member clubs, including Oxford University Labour Club and Cambridge University Labour Club, disaffiliated from Labour Students.

Further to the disaffiliations by Labour university Clubs, a motion was tabled by Jon Lansman at the Labour Party NEC meeting in September 2019 to dissolve the current organisation on the grounds that it did not pay its affiliation fees nor submitted its political rules to the party. At the NEC meeting this motion passed and Labour Students is no longer affiliated to the Labour Party. This action was challenged by the incumbent Labour Students leadership, but they were unsuccessful.

A new, refounded National Labour Students (NLS) was passed at the 2021 Labour Party Conference. National Committee elections were held in August 2022 and Ben McGowan was elected as the inaugural chair of the organisation on 2 September 2022. Internal elections in 2024 saw the victory of the &quot;Organise&quot; faction, backed by Labour First and Progressive Britain, which defeated the left-wing &quot;Socialist Future&quot; group: Ruby Herbert replaced McGowan soon afterwards.

== Internal organisation ==
Prior to 2019, Labour Students was a &#x27;socialist society&#x27;, affiliated to the Labour Party. This means that, whilst its aims were broadly in line with the wider party, Labour Students was an independent organisation and was entitled to democratically determine its own policy and governance. Labour Students members were entitled to vote in the affiliates section of Labour leadership elections.

The refounded National Labour Students is a formal branch of the Labour Party, and as such is not responsible for its own governance. Any Labour Party member who is a student is automatically a member of National Labour Students

===National Events===
Generally, before the organisation&#x27;s relaunch, Labour Students held four main national events each year, attended by club members from institutions across the country.

; Summer Training : Summer Training is primarily intended for members entering their second and third years of study. There is often a focus on preparing Labour Clubs for recruitment drives at the beginning of the new academic year. The event is usually structured with a variety breakout sessions and workshops, led by industry experts, trade unions and other campaigning organisations. In recent years Summer Training has included sessions led by Matthew Doyle (former deputy director of Communications, 10 Downing Street), Kirsty McNeill (former adviser to Gordon Brown) and community organising group Movement for Change. There is also usually a heavy emphasis on training from the four liberation campaigns.

; Political Weekend : Political Weekend is usually the event where Labour Students welcomes its new members each year. Labour Students usually hosts a number of high-profile speakers, including government ministers during periods of Labour government and members of the Shadow Cabinet in times of opposition.

; Liberation Conference 
Liberation Conference sees the election of Labour Students’ four Liberation Officers (see ‘Liberation Campaigns’). It also includes panels and sessions around issues of particular importance to Liberation groups, for example mental health services or tackling antisemitism on campuses.

; National Conference : National Conference sees the election of the Labour Students National Committee for the following year, as well further policy debate. Though nominally described as an &quot;election&quot;, only a small number of delegates vote, along lines pre-determined by their nominating clubs. National Conference is often held in conjunction with Young Labour Conference, to help reduce members&#x27; travel costs.

===National Committee===
The National Labour Students Committee convenes regularly and works together to ensure the organisation runs smoothly and works effectively to represent members.

===National Committee===


===Liberation Campaigns===

Within Labour Students there are four autonomous liberation campaigns. These were the Women&#x27;s, Lesbian Gay Bisexual &amp; Trans, Disabled Students and Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME) Students campaigns, all of which are entitled to elect an officer to the National Committee. Labour Students holds caucuses for each of the liberation groups at every national event, has an equal opportunities policy and ensures all events are fully accessible.

===Scotland and Wales===
There are separate organisations for Labour Clubs in the devolved nations, known as Welsh Labour Students and Scottish Labour Students respectively. The Chairs of these two organisations also sit on the committee of Labour Students as full members.

==Campaigning==

===Priority Campaign===
Labour Students took on a major campaign each year, voted for in an all-member ballot. Recent campaigns have included:
*&quot;Make Child Poverty History&quot; campaign (2006–2007)
*&quot;Sex, Lives and Politics&quot; (2005–2006) – This was followed by a government reduction of VAT on condoms to the EU minimum of 5%.
*The Living Wage Campaign (2011–2013) – Labour Students worked in collaboration with the trade union UNISON to equip members with the skills to fight for a living wage to be paid to staff on their university campuses. The campaign was extremely successful, with clubs including Manchester and Kent securing the living wage at their institutions. 
*The Voter Registration Campaign (2012–2013) – Labour Students intended to increase the number of students registered to vote.
*A Million More Voices (2016–2017) - Campaign aimed at introducing automatic voter registration.
*Somewhere To Call Home (2017–2018) – Campaign aimed at tackling &quot;poor living conditions and extortionate rents for students.&quot;
*Time For Rights (2018– 2019) – Campaign to protect the rights of workers in Students’ Unions and Universities from Brexit.

== Labour Students and the National Union of Students ==
Every year, Labour Students actively organised and campaigned within the National Union of Students (NUS). As a result of this, Labour Students was viewed as an influential faction within the NUS and its members were frequently elected to the NUS National Executive Council (NEC) and to full-time officer positions, although 2015 saw a majority of their candidates losing to those to the Left.

===History within the National Union of Students===

In the late 1970s, Labour Students (then NOLS) worked within the NUS as part of the Broad Left, a student coalition which also included the student wing of the Communist Party of Great Britain and independent left wing students. The Broad Left stood slates of candidates in NUS elections. (The Broad Left is not to be confused with the post-1997 grouping Student Broad Left.) In the early 1980s NOLS broke with the Broad Left and presented its own slate of candidates in NUS elections. In 1982, NOLS won the presidency of NUS on its own for the first time. A succession of NOLS candidates were elected to the NUS Presidency until 2000 with the strongest challenges generally coming from those to the left of the Labour Party. Several former NOLS NUS Presidents, including Charles Clarke and Jim Murphy, went on to serve as Cabinet ministers, serving as members of a Labour government. Throughout this period, NOLS members of the NUS National Executive Committee were a minority, but exercised effective control.

Labour Students&#x27; flagship policy in NUS was the rejection of campaigning for universal grants, in favour of targeting student support funds towards poorer students through means testing. National Conference 2006 narrowly supported this policy, but it was renewed with a much increased majority in 2007. However, the position was reversed again when National Conference 2016 voted to campaign for universal living grants, funded through progressive taxation, in both further and higher education, in a policy change that had been pushed forward by the left-wing group, the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts.

==Alumni==
Recent graduates of Labour Students have often gone on to work in Labour Party headquarters, as ministerial special advisers, Trade Union officials and as members of left-leaning think tanks. Many also go on to enjoy successful careers outside of the politics.

<doc id="569138" wikidata="Q1984623" url="?curid=569138" title="Doctor of Divinity">
<text>A Doctor of Divinity (DD or DDiv; ) is the holder of an advanced academic degree in divinity (i.e., Christian theology and ministry). The term is more common in the English-speaking world than elsewhere. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the DD is usually a higher doctorate conferred upon a religious scholar of standing and distinction, usually for accomplishments beyond the PhD or ThD level. In the United States, the DD is generally an honorary degree. In Catholic universities, faculties of theology usually grant the degree of Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD), but the DD may be awarded as an honorary degree.

== Doctor of Divinity by country or church ==

=== British Isles ===
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the DD is a higher doctorate conferred by universities upon a religious scholar of standing and distinction, usually for accomplishments beyond the PhD level. Typically, an academic candidate will submit a collection of work which has been previously published in a peer-reviewed context and pay an examination fee. The university then assembles a committee of academics, both internal and external, who review the work submitted and decide on whether the candidate deserves the doctorate based on the submission. Most universities restrict candidacy to graduates or academic staff of several years&#x27; standing.

At the University of Oxford, doctors of divinity are ranked first in &quot;academic precedence and standing&quot;, while at the University of Cambridge they rank ahead of all other doctors in the &quot;order of seniority of graduates&quot;. Traditionally, bishops of the Church of England and the Church of Ireland were granted a DD from one of the Anglican universities (Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin), or as a Lambeth degree conferred by authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury. 

=== United States ===

In the United States, most doctors of divinity hold a degree conferred &quot;honoris causa&quot; by a church-related college, seminary, or university to recognize the recipient&#x27;s achievements as a minister of religion. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. graduated as a Ph.D. in systematic theology from Boston University in 1955 and subsequently received honorary doctor of divinity degrees from the Chicago Theological Seminary (1957), Boston University (1959), Wesleyan College (1964), and Springfield College (1964). Billy Graham, who received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from The King&#x27;s College and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was regularly addressed as &quot;Dr. Graham&quot;, though his highest earned degree was a Bachelor of Arts degree in anthropology from Wheaton College.

Under federal law, a 1974 judgement accepted expert opinion that an &quot;honorary doctor of divinity is a strictly religious title with no academic standing. Such titles may be issued by bona fide churches and religious denominations, such as plaintiff Universal Life Church, so long as their issuance is limited to a course of instruction in the principles of the church or religious denomination&quot;. However, under the California Education Code, &quot;an institution owned, controlled, and operated and maintained by a religious organization lawfully operating as a nonprofit religious corporation pursuant to Part 4 (commencing with Section 9110) of Division 2 of Title 1 of the Corporations Code&quot; that offers &quot;instruction... limited to the principles of that religious organization, or to courses offered pursuant to Section 2789 of Business and Professions Code&quot; may confer &quot;degrees and diplomas only in the beliefs and practices of the church, religious denomination, or religious organization&quot; so long as &quot;the diploma or degree is limited to evidence of completion of that education&quot;; institutions &quot;shall not award degrees in any area of physical science&quot;, while
In a 1976 interview with Morley Safer of the TV newsmagazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, Universal Life Church founder Kirby J. Hensley professed that the church&#x27;s honorary doctor of divinity degree was &quot;...just a little piece of paper. And it ain&#x27;t worth anything, you know, under God&#x27;s mighty green Earth—you know what I mean?—as far as value.&quot; In 2006, Universal Life Church minister Kevin Andrews advised potential degree recipients not to misrepresent the title as an educational achievement to employers, recommending instead that it would be appropriate to list such credentials &quot;under the heading of Titles, Awards, or Other Achievements&quot; on &quot;curricula vitae&quot;.

As of 2009, 20 U.S. states and Puerto Rico had some form of exemption provision under which religious institutions can grant religious degrees without accreditation or government oversight.

=== Catholic Church ===
In the Catholic Church, a doctor of divinity is usually the holder of an honorary degree, often conferred upon a bishop. In the pontifical university system, a holder of the highest earned degree in Catholic theology is styled &quot;Doctor of Sacred Theology&quot; (in Latin, &quot;Sacrae Theologiae Doctor&quot;, abbreviated STD).

== Contrast with other religious degrees ==

A doctor of divinity should not be confused with a Doctor of Theology (Th.D.), the holder of a research doctorate in theology awarded by universities and divinity schools. However, many universities award a Ph.D. rather than a Th.D. to graduates of higher-level religious studies programs. A Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD) holds another research doctorate, in particular awarded by Catholic pontifical universities and faculties. A Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) holds another doctorate-level religious degree, which is a professional doctorate rather than a research doctorate.

== &quot;The Doctor and Student&quot; ==

Christopher St. Germain&#x27;s book &quot;The Doctor and Student&quot; (1528) describes a dialogue between a Doctor of Divinity and a law student in England containing the grounds of those laws together with questions and cases concerning the equity thereof.

<text>Oliver Joseph St. John Gogarty (17 August 1878 – 22 September 1957) was an Irish poet, author, otolaryngologist, athlete, politician, and conversationalist. He served as the inspiration for Buck Mulligan in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

==Life==

===Early life===
Gogarty was born 17 August 1878 in Rutland Square, Dublin, the eldest child of Henry Gogarty, a well-to-do Dublin physician, and Margaret Gogarty (née Oliver), the daughter of a Galway mill owner. Three siblings (Henry, Mary, and Richard) were born later. Gogarty&#x27;s father, himself the son of a medical doctor, had been educated at Trinity College and owned two fashionable homes in Dublin, which set the Gogartys apart from other Irish Catholic families at that time and allowed them access to the same social circles as the Protestant Ascendancy.

Gogarty was sent by his father to the Christian Brothers&#x27; O&#x27;Connell School (North Richmond Street, Dublin), which he happily attended, 1890–92. When his father died suddenly in 1891, his family then sent him to Mungret College, a boarding school near Limerick. He was unhappy in his new school, and the following year he transferred to Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, England, which he liked a little better, later referring to it as &quot;a religious jail&quot;.

Gogarty returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at Clongowes Wood College while studying for examinations with the Royal University of Ireland. He was a talented athlete; in England, he had briefly played for the Preston North End FC Reserve, and while at Clongowes he played for the Bohemian FC. He also played on Clongowes&#x27;s soccer and cricket elevens. His extracurricular interests, which also included cycling and drinking, prevented him from being an attentive student, and in 1898 he switched to the medical school at Trinity College, having failed eight of his ten examinations at the Royal.

===University days===
As one of Dublin&#x27;s &quot;medicos&quot;, Gogarty was known to be fond of public pranks and midnight carousing in &quot;the Kips&quot;, Dublin&#x27;s red-light district. He had a talent for humorous and bawdy verse, which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed mnemonic lyrics to aid his medical studies. He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, . Between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drowning. He became interested in Irish nationalism after meeting Arthur Griffith in 1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to &quot;The United Irishman&quot; over subsequent years.

A serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity. His witty conversation made him a favourite with the dons, particularly John Pentland Mahaffy (formerly the tutor of Oscar Wilde) and Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, and between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s prizes for verse. In 1900 he made the acquaintance of W. B. Yeats (of whom his mother highly approved) and of George Moore (of whom she did not) and began to frequent Dublin literary circles. He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as Seamus O&#x27;Sullivan and James Joyce. In 1904 he spent two terms at Oxford to compete for the Newdigate Prize, but lost to G.K.A. Bell, the future Bishop of Chichester, who became a friend and frequent correspondent over the next few years.

Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the Martello Tower in Sandycove. The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to G.K.A. Bell, was to &quot;house the Bard&quot; (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required &quot;a year in which to finish his novel&quot;. The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so. Joyce briefly took up residence in the Tower the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of &quot;Ulysses)&quot; but left again after only six days. Forty years later in America, Gogarty attributed Joyce&#x27;s abrupt departure to his and S.C. Trench&#x27;s midnight antics with a loaded revolver. Joyce and Gogarty corresponded intermittently during the early years of Joyce&#x27;s continental exile and occasionally planned meetings, but contemporaneous letters from Joyce to his brother reveal deep distrust of Gogarty&#x27;s motives, and their friendship was never fully renewed. Gogarty made use of the Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue, and officially held the lease until 1925.

In 1904 and 1905 Gogarty published several short poems in the London publication &quot;The Venture&quot; and in John Eglinton&#x27;s journal &quot;Dana&quot;. His name also appeared in print as the renegade priest Fr. Oliver Gogarty in George Moore&#x27;s 1905 novel &quot;The Lake&quot;, an occurrence which upset Gogarty&#x27;s devout mother. In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of Arthur Griffith&#x27;s Sinn Féin, a non-violent political movement with a plan for Irish autonomy modelled after the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy.

===Medical career and family===

In August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning Connemara family. Eager to establish himself with a profession, he passed his final medical examinations in June 1907, several months after the death of his mother. In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus Gogarty (known as &quot;Noll&quot;) was born, and in autumn of that year, Gogarty left for Vienna to finish the practical phase of his medical training. Owing in part to the influence of his mentor, Sir Robert Woods, Gogarty had decided to specialise in otolaryngology, and in Vienna, he studied under Ottokar Chiari, Markus Hajek, and Robert Bárány.

Returning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore. Three years later, he joined the staff of the Meath Hospital and remained there for the remainder of his medical career. He became known for flamboyant theatrics in the operating room, including off-the-cuff witticisms and the flinging of recently removed larynxes at the viewing gallery. He also maintained ENT consulting rooms in Ely Place, attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off patients for free.

Gogarty and his wife had two more children, Dermot (born 1908) and Brenda (born 1911), and in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renvyle House, a large country house in Renvyle, Connemara, from Caroline Blake. He became a keen motorist during this time, purchasing a succession of automobiles that culminated with a buttercup-coloured Rolls-Royce. During the following decade he was also interested in aviation, earning a pilot&#x27;s licence and helping to found the Irish Aero Club.

===Free State Senator===
As a Sinn Féiner during the Irish War of Independence, Gogarty participated in a variety of anti-Black and Tan schemes, allowing his home to be used as a safe house and transporting disguised IRA volunteers in his car. Following the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Gogarty sided with the pro-Treaty government (headed by his close friend Arthur Griffith) and was made a Free State Senator. When Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty frequently attended his bedside. His death on 12 August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty; W.T. Cosgrave later observed that &quot;he was almost mortally wounded when Griffith died, he was so very, very much attached to him.&quot; Gogarty carried out Griffith&#x27;s official autopsy and embalmment and went on to perform the same offices for Michael Collins, another close friend whom Gogarty had often sheltered in his Ely Place home prior to his assassination. It was rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make Gogarty the new Governor-General of the Irish Free State, but in his absence, the post went to Tim Healy.

In November 1922, anti-Treaty IRA commander Liam Lynch issued a general order to his forces to shoot Free State senators. Two months later, Gogarty was kidnapped by a group of anti-Treaty militants, who lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing him to visit a sick patient. Gogarty was driven to an empty house near Chapelizod and held under armed guard. Aware that he might be in imminent danger of execution, Gogarty contrived to have himself led out into the garden (purportedly by claiming to be suffering from diarrhoea), where he broke free from his captors and flung himself into the River Liffey; he then swam to shore and delivered himself to the protection of the police barracks in Phoenix Park. In February of that same year, Renvyle was burnt to the ground by anti-Treaty forces. Following these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until February 1924. Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the Liffey in gratitude for his life.

Gogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the Seanad in 1936, during which time he identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims. He believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the British Commonwealth so as to &quot;keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen&quot;. He supported rural electrification schemes, road improvement, reforestation and conservation, prevention of livestock cruelty, and educational reform. His views on controversial issues such as censorship and birth control were ambiguous; after expressing initial support for the Censorship Bill, he eventually went on to denounce it in scathing terms (&quot;I think it is high time the men of this country found some other way of loving God than by hating women&quot;), and while generally professing to oppose the sale of prophylactics, he voiced support for their usage in certain cases. He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing, about which he spoke frequently. His speeches frequently contained puns, wordplays, and extended poetic quotations, and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his attempt to have the phoenix statue in Phoenix Park included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection Bill. He was notoriously scornful of the government&#x27;s attempts to reinstate the Irish language (which he referred to as &quot;Woolworth&#x27;s Irish&quot;), proposing that funding be used instead for housing and school health services, and remained perpetually suspicious of Éamon de Valera, against whose economic policies, character, and personal appearance he often hurled invectives during Seanad proceedings. De Valera eventually dissolved the Seanad when it persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty&#x27;s political career.

===Literary endeavours===
Gogarty maintained close friendships with W. B. Yeats, AE, George Moore, Lord Dunsany, James Stephens, Seamus O&#x27;Sullivan, and other Dublin literati, and he continued to write poetry in the midst of his political and professional duties. Three small books of poetry (&quot;Hyperthuleana&quot;, &quot;Secret Springs of Dublin Song&quot;, and &quot;The Ship and Other Poems&quot;) were published between 1916 and 1918. Gogarty also tried his hand at playwriting, producing a slum drama (&quot;Blight&quot;) in 1917 under the pseudonym &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;, and two comedies (&quot;A Serious Thing&quot; and &quot;The Enchanted Trousers&quot;) in 1919 under the pseudonym &quot;Gideon Ouseley&quot;, all three of which were performed at the Abbey Theatre.

Gogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties and thirties. His 1924 book of poetry &quot;An Offering of Swans&quot; won the Gold Medal for poetry at the revived Tailteann Games. The book also includes &quot;Tailteann Ode,&quot; which won him a bronze medal at the 1924 Olympic Games (at the time, the Olympics included art competitions in addition to sports). Gogarty later described the poem as &quot;rather tripe&quot;). In 1929 another book of verse, &quot;Wild Apples&quot;, was published, and was followed in 1933 by &quot;Selected Poems&quot;. Gogarty was also a member of Yeats&#x27;s Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social functions. 1936 saw the publication of Yeats&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse&quot;, which contained seventeen of Gogarty&#x27;s poems and an introduction proclaiming him &quot;one of the great lyric poets of our age.&quot; The over-representation given to Gogarty outraged many poets and perplexed Gogarty himself, who remarked, &quot;What right have I to figure so bulkily? None from a poetical point of view... Sappho herself could not have made a more subjective anthology.&quot;

In 1935 Gogarty published his first prose work, &quot;As I Was Going Down Sackville Street&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Phantasy in Fact&quot;), a semi-fictional novel-memoir that tells, in reverse chronological order, the story of Gogarty&#x27;s Dublin through a series of interconnected anecdotes and lively characters sketches. Shortly after its publication, it became the subject of a lawsuit by a Jewish art dealer, Harry Sinclair, who claimed that he and his recently deceased twin brother, William Sinclair, had been libeled by the publication. The two men did not appear as named characters in the book, but some derogatory lines of verse beginning &quot;Two Jews grew in Sackville Street&quot;, written by Gogarty&#x27;s friend George Redding and included in a scene in the novel, were widely known to refer to the Sinclair siblings. Harry Sinclair further recognised a reference to his grandfather, described in the text as one who &quot;enticed little girls into his office&quot;, an offence of which his grandfather had in fact been convicted. Gogarty responded to the charges by claiming that the unnamed Jews were parodies or composite characters rather than deliberate evocations of living persons. The case attracted a great deal of public attention, with one commentator observing that &quot;only &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, rewritten by James Joyce, could really capture the mood of this trial.&quot; Among the witnesses for the plaintiff was William Sinclair&#x27;s nephew-by-marriage, Samuel Beckett, then a little-known writer, who was humiliatingly denounced as a &quot;bawd and blasphemer&quot; by Gogarty&#x27;s counsel. Gogarty ultimately lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay £900 in damages, plus court costs. This outcome deeply embittered Gogarty, who had already suffered financial setbacks after the stock market crash of 1929 and felt that the verdict had been politically motivated.

In spite of the &quot;Sackville Street&quot; imbroglio, Gogarty&#x27;s output over the next two years was prolific. In 1938 he published &quot;I Follow St. Patrick&quot;, a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty&#x27;s rambling visits to various sites traditionally associated with St. Patrick; in 1939 he published &quot;Tumbling in the Hay&quot;, a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and &quot;Elbow Room&quot;, another collection of poetry. In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet Patrick Kavanagh, whose autobiography &quot;The Green Fool&quot; said of Kavanagh&#x27;s first visit to Gogarty&#x27;s home: &quot;I mistook Gogarty&#x27;s white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife.&quot; Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;mistress&quot;, was awarded £100 in damages.

===American years===
With the onset of World War II, Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur aviator, attempted to enlist in the RAF and the RAMC as a doctor. He was denied on grounds of age (then 61). He then departed in September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his wife to manage Renvyle House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel. When his return to Ireland was delayed by the war, Gogarty applied for American citizenship and eventually decided to reside permanently in the United States. Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care packages to his family and returned home for occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time. His primary American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars. He also spent time in Vermont and in Wyckoff, New Jersey.

Feeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as a practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his writing. In addition to various essays and short stories, his prose output included &quot;Going Native&quot;, a satire on English social mores, &quot;Mad Grandeur&quot; and &quot;Mr. Petunia&quot;, two period narratives composed with an eye to having them optioned as Hollywood films, and &quot;Rolling Down the Lea&quot; and &quot;It Isn&#x27;t This Time of Year at All!&quot;, two loosely constructed memoirs. He also published two books of poems, &quot;Perennial&quot; and &quot;Unselected Poems&quot;; a collection of bawdy verse, &quot;The Merry Muses of Hibernia&quot;, was planned but never completed. Gogarty&#x27;s literary output during the forties and fifties is generally considered to be inferior to his earlier writings.

Gogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September 1957 he collapsed in the street on his way to dinner. He died on 22 September 1957; his body was flown home to Ireland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle.

==Literary portrayal==

A highly visible and distinctive Dublin character during his lifetime, Gogarty appears in a number of memoirs penned by his contemporaries, notably George Moore&#x27;s &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;, where he goes both by his own name and by the pseudonym &quot;Conan&quot;. His most famous literary incarnation, however, is as Buck Mulligan, the irrepressible roommate of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Mulligan quotes a number of songs and poems known to have been written by Gogarty, the most famous of which, &quot;The Song of the Cheerful (But Slightly Sarcastic) Jesus&quot;, was originally sent to Joyce as a belated Christmas peace offering after their quarrels of 1904. Other details, such as Mulligan&#x27;s Hellenism, his status as a medical student, his history of saving men from drowning, his friendship with George Moore, and the metrical arrangement of his full name (Malachi Roland St. John Mulligan) parallel Gogarty&#x27;s biography. Due to his influence on Joyce (he is also sometimes cited as an inspiration for &quot;Dubliners&quot; character Ignatius Gallaher and &quot;Exiles&quot; antagonist Robert Hand), Gogarty&#x27;s name often comes up in Joyce scholarship, though Gogarty&#x27;s own editors and biographers have complained that these references are frequently inaccurate, owing to Gogarty-related errata in Richard Ellmann&#x27;s &quot;James Joyce&quot; and a tendency to conflate the real-life Gogarty with the fictional character of Buck Mulligan.

It has also been suggested that the speaker of W. B. Yeats&#x27;s poem &quot;High Talk&quot;, &quot;Malachi Stilt-Jack&quot;, is intended to be a representation of Gogarty.

==Legacy==
A pub in the Temple Bar district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John Gogarty Literary Festival is held in the author&#x27;s family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in Connemara. A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the Tallaght University Hospital, now also bears his name.

William Dawson wrote &quot;The Lay of Oliver Gogarty&quot; about his kidnap and escape.

A documentary on Gogarty, &quot;Oliver St. John Gogarty: Silence Would Never Do&quot; was produced in 1987.

<doc id="569144" wikidata="Q843589" url="?curid=569144" title="Western European Time">
<text>Western European Time (WET, UTC+00:00) is a time zone covering parts of western Europe and consists of countries using UTC+00:00 (also known as Greenwich Mean Time, abbreviated GMT). It is one of the three standard time zones in the European Union along with Central European Time and Eastern European Time.

The following Western European countries and regions use UTC+00:00 in winter months:

*Portugal, since 1912 with pauses (except Azores, UTC−01:00)
*United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies, since 1847 in England, Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man, and since 1916 in Northern Ireland, with pauses
*Ireland, since 1916, except between 1968 and 1971
*Canary Islands, since 1946 (rest of Spain is CET, UTC+01:00)
*Faroe Islands, since 1908
* North Eastern Greenland (Danmarkshavn and surrounding area)
*Iceland, since 1968, without summer time changes

All the above countries except Iceland implement daylight saving time in summer (from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October each year), switching to Western European Summer Time (WEST, UTC+01:00), which is one hour ahead of WET. WEST is called British Summer Time in the UK and is legally defined as Irish Standard Time in Ireland.

The nominal span of the UTC+00:00 time zone is 7.5°E to 7.5°W (0° ± 7.5°), but does not include the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Gibraltar or Spain (except Canary Islands) which use Central European Time (CET) even though these are mostly or completely west of 7.5°E. Conversely, Iceland and eastern Greenland use UTC+00:00 although both are west of 7.5°W. In September 2013, a Spanish parliamentary committee recommended switching to UTC+00:00.

==Historical uses==
A slight variation of UTC+00:00, based until 1911 on the Paris Meridian, was used in:

*Andorra: 1901–1946
*Belgium: 1892–1914 (without daylight saving time) and 1919–1940 (with daylight saving time)
*France: 1911–1940 and 1944–1945
*Gibraltar: 1880–1957
*Luxembourg: 1918–1940
*Monaco: 1911–1945

Until the Second World War, France used UTC+00:00. However, the German occupation switched France to German time, and it has remained in CET since then. Two other occupied territories, Belgium and the Netherlands, did the same, and Spain also switched to CET in solidarity with Germany under the orders of General Franco.

In the United Kingdom, from 1940 to 1945 British Summer Time (BST=CET) was used in winters, and from 1941 to 1945 and again in 1947, British Double Summer Time (BDST=CEST) was used in summers. Between 18 February 1968 and 31 October 1971, BST was used all year round.

In Ireland, from 1940 to 1946 Irish Summer Time (IST=CET) was used all year round, with no &#x27;double&#x27; summer time akin to that in the United Kingdom. Between 18 February 1968 and 31 October 1971, Irish Standard Time was used all year round.

In Portugal, CET was used in the mainland from 1966 to 1976 and from 1992 to 1996. The autonomous region of the Azores used WET from 1992 to 1993.

== Anomalies ==

=== Regions located outside UTC longitudes ===
Located west of 22°30′ W (&quot;physical&quot; UTC−2)

* Western parts of Iceland

==== Located west of 7°30′ W (&quot;physical&quot; UTC-1)====
* Most of Iceland
* Mykines, Faroe Islands
* Western Ireland
* Western Portugal
* Madeira islands
* Canary Islands
* North-eastern Greenland
* Western parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland

=== Areas located within UTC+00:00 longitudes using other time zones ===
These areas are actually located between 7°30′E and 7°30′W (nominally UTC+0) but use UTC+01:00 (Central European Time, nominally for longitudes between 7°30′E and 22°30′E):

All of 
* Andorra
* Belgium
* Luxembourg
* Monaco
* Netherlands

and most of
* France
* Spain
and minor parts of other countries.

<doc id="569145" wikidata="Q577925" url="?curid=569145" title="Eamon (singer)">
<text>Eamon Doyle (born September 19, 1983), known mononymously as Eamon, is an American singer and songwriter. He is mainly known for his 2003 hit single &quot;Fuck It (I Don&#x27;t Want You Back)&quot;.

==Early life==
Eamon Doyle was born in Staten Island, New York City, the son of Diane ( Zizzo), an Italian-American nurse, and Walter Doyle, a counselor with a private practice, of Irish descent. His father was a member of a doo-wop group named The Elations. He began singing at age nine and touring and performing with his father&#x27;s group at the same age. 

At age 15, while working in a music studio, he caught the attention of Nat Robinson, the CEO of &quot;First Priority Music&quot; who in turn entrusted Doyle to songwriter/producer Milk Dee, who had worked with musicians such as MC Lyte, Janet Jackson, and Mary J. Blige. Dee and his co-producer Mark Passy helped refine Eamon&#x27;s sound. After Robinson shopped Eamon to over 22 different record labels he finally secured a record deal with record executive Barry Weiss and Eamon was eventually signed to Jive Records.

==Musical career==
===&quot;I Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot; (2003–2004)===
Eamon&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Fuck It (I Don&#x27;t Want You Back)&quot; immediately caught the attention of urban, rhythmic, pop radio stations when it was released in the US in late 2003. Jive fast-tracked the release of a music video for the song and commissioned an album for release in early 2004. The single reached the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and the popularity of the song helped his album, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot;, debut in the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. 

The success of the song prompted Jive to release the song internationally, where it topped the charts in various countries, including Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In the latter country, &quot;Fuck It (I Don&#x27;t Want You Back)&quot; remained at the summit of the UK Singles Chart for four weeks and became Britain&#x27;s second best-selling song of 2004. In Italy, the song was such a big hit that Eamon sang an Italian version called &quot;Solo&quot;. The success of the single and the controversial nature of its lyrics prompted production of an answer single, &quot;F.U.R.B. (Fuck You Right Back)&quot;, by then-unknown female singer Frankee who had claimed to be Eamon&#x27;s ex-girlfriend (which Eamon denied). The song also earned Eamon a Guinness World Record for &quot;the most expletives in a No. 1 song&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Fuck It (I Don&#x27;t Want You Back)&quot;, Eamon released a second single, &quot;I Love Them Ho&#x27;s (Ho-Wop)&quot;. The song did not match the success of its predecessor, although it was a top ten hit in Denmark, where it peaked at number seven on the Danish Singles Chart. &quot;I Love Them Ho&#x27;s (Ho-Wop)&quot; also had a remix and video featuring fellow Staten Island resident Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s Ghostface Killah. In return Eamon appeared on Ghostface&#x27;s album &quot;More Fish&quot;.

===&quot;Love and Pain&quot; (2006)===
On September 15, 2006, Eamon released his first single from his upcoming second studio album, &quot;Love &amp; Pain&quot;, titled &quot;(How Could You) Bring Him Home&quot;. &quot;Love &amp; Pain&quot; was released on December 5, 2006. The album was produced by Happy Perez, Jeff Smith, and Milk Dee.

===Later projects and &quot;Golden Rail Motel&quot; (2007–present)===
Eamon and Jive Records parted ways in 2008. In 2011, Eamon signed with SMC Entertainment, a publicly traded independent record label. Eamon signed a two-album deal worth $1,000,000 and began recording with Grammy winning producer Mikal Blue (Colbie Caillat, Jason Mraz, OneRepublic). SMC was almost immediately delinquent on payments for musicians, studio costs, and advances. Eamon and Mikal Blue continued to record the album in spite of SMC not fulfilling their contractual obligation. 

Legal action was taken at the end of 2012 to resolve the issue. At that point, SMC financial backer David Levy was arrested for stock fraud. It gave Eamon more leverage in the litigation, but not enough to get him out of his contract. Levy was later sentenced to nine years in prison in 2013. The album was finished in September 2012, and Eamon was still under contract with SMC, but could not release any music or perform for money. He could, however, collaborate with other artists. 

Eamon joined forces with R.A. the Rugged Man on the rapper&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Legends Never Die&quot;. Eamon is featured on two songs: &quot;Luv to Fuk&quot; and &quot;Still Get Through the Day&quot;. A video for &quot;Still Get Through the Day&quot; came out on February 4, 2014. In May 2014, SMC settled with Eamon to release him from his 360-record deal. Most of the album he recorded with Mikal Blue could not be sold or even made public, but Eamon became a free agent.

In 2015, Eamon appeared on the Jedi Mind Tricks&#x27; album &quot;The Thief and the Fallen&quot;. Again, he is featured on two songs: &quot;Fraudulent Cloth&quot; and &quot;And God Said to Cain&quot; (which also features A-F-R-O and R.A. the Rugged Man). A video for &quot;Fraudulent Cloth&quot; came out on May 27, 2015.

In 2016, he has appeared on a few more collaborations, including &quot;The Void&quot; on Vinnie Paz&#x27;s solo project &quot;Cornerstone of the Corner Store&quot;, and &quot;Use Them Blues&quot; on the Afro &amp; Marco Polo album &quot;A-F-R-O Polo&quot;.

On April 7, 2017, Eamon released the video for &quot;Be My Girl&quot;, the lead single from his upcoming album, &quot;Golden Rail Motel&quot;, which was released on September 15, 2017. On June 15, 2017, Eamon released the second single, &quot;Before I Die&quot;, from the album. &quot;Golden Rail Motel&quot; was Eamon&#x27;s first new album in over a decade and was produced by Eamon, Stoupe (Jedi Mind Tricks), Dan Ubick (Connie Price and the Keystones), Snipe Young, and Mikal Blue. On September 8, 2017, Eamon released the video for the third single &quot;I Got Soul&quot;, which is a single-shot video directed by Doug Quill.

In August 2017, Vinnie Paz released the video for &quot;The Ghost I Used to Be&quot; featuring Eamon from Paz&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Cornerstone of the Corner Store&quot;.

In June 2019, Eamon announced via Instagram that he would be releasing a yet unnamed EP and will be releasing a song from the EP every week. The singles &quot;Runnin&#x27; Around&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot; have been released thus far and received overall positive reception.

<text>A gazette is an official journal, a newspaper of record, or simply a newspaper.

In English and French speaking countries, newspaper publishers have applied the name &quot;Gazette&quot; since the 17th century; today, numerous weekly and daily newspapers bear the name &quot;The Gazette&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Gazette&quot; is a loanword from the French language, which is, in turn, a 16th-century permutation of the Italian &quot;gazzetta&quot;, which is the name of a particular Venetian coin. &quot;Gazzetta&quot; became an epithet for &quot;newspaper&quot; during the early and middle 16th century, when the first Venetian newspapers cost one gazzetta. (Compare with other vernacularisms from publishing lingo, such as the British &quot;penny dreadful&quot; and the American &quot;dime novel&quot;.) This loanword, with its various corruptions, persists in numerous modern languages (Slavic languages, Turkic languages).

==Government gazettes==

In England, with the 1700 founding of &quot;The Oxford Gazette&quot; (which became the &quot;London Gazette&quot;), the word &quot;gazette&quot; came to indicate a public journal of the government; today, such a journal is sometimes called a government gazette. For some governments, publishing information in a gazette was or is a legal necessity by which official documents come into force and enter the public domain. Such is the case for documents published in &quot;Royal Thai Government Gazette&quot; (est. 1858), and in &quot;The Gazette of India&quot; (est. 1950).

The government of the United Kingdom requires government gazettes of its member countries. Publication of the &quot;Edinburgh Gazette&quot;, the official government newspaper in Scotland, began in 1699. The &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot; of Ireland followed in 1705, but ceased when the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom in 1922; the &quot;Iris Oifigiúil&quot; (Irish: &quot;Official Gazette&quot;) replaced it. The &quot;Belfast Gazette&quot; of Northern Ireland published its first issue in 1921.

==&quot;Gazette&quot; as a verb==
Chiefly in British English, the transitive verb &quot;to gazette&quot; means &quot;to announce or publish in a gazette&quot;; especially where &quot;gazette&quot; refers to a public journal or a newspaper of record. For example, &quot;Lake Nakuru was gazetted as a bird sanctuary in 1960 and upgraded to National Park status in 1968.&quot; British Army personnel decorations, promotions, and officer commissions are gazetted in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Official Newspaper of Record for the United Kingdom&quot;. &quot;Gazettal&quot; (a noun) is the act of gazetting; for example, &quot;the gazettal of the bird sanctuary&quot;.

<text>Stephnie de Ruyter is a former leader of the New Zealand Democratic Party, a small centre-left New Zealand political party based upon Social Credit economics. The Democrats, who, in June 2018, returned to campaigning under the name Social Credit are currently outside Parliament.

While the Democratic Party was a member of the Alliance, de Ruyter served as an Alliance candidate. In the 1999 election, she was the Alliance&#x27;s candidate for the Invercargill electorate, and was ranked twenty-second on the party&#x27;s list. She was not elected. Later, when the Democrats joined Jim Anderton to establish the breakaway Progressive Coalition, de Ruyter took an active role in building the new party. By the time of the 2002 election, de Ruyter was deputy leader of the Democrats and was ranked fifth on the Progressive list. She also stood as the Progressive Coalition&#x27;s candidate in Invercargill. Once again, she was not elected.

Not long after the 2002 election, the Democrats opted to leave the Progressive Coalition and reestablish themselves as an independent party. The leader of the Democrats, Grant Gillon, along with the former leader John Wright, unsuccessfully urged the party to remain a member of the Progressive Coalition. De Ruyter was elected leader on Gillon standing down and John Wright also leaving.

De Ruyter has also been involved in local-body politics in Invercargill, standing for election to the Southland health board.

<doc id="569152" wikidata="Q156686" url="?curid=569152" title="Gesneriaceae">
<text>Gesneriaceae, the gesneriad family, is a family of flowering plants consisting of about 152 genera and ca. 3,540 species in the tropics and subtropics of the Old World (almost all Didymocarpoideae) and the New World (most Gesnerioideae), with a very small number extending to temperate areas. Many species have colorful and showy flowers and are cultivated as ornamental plants.

==Etymology==
The family name is based on the genus &quot;Gesneria&quot;, which honours Swiss naturalist and humanist Conrad Gessner.

==Description==

Most species are herbaceous perennials or subshrubs but a few are woody shrubs or small trees. The phyllotaxy is usually opposite and decussate, but leaves have a spiral or alternate arrangement in some groups. As with other members of the Lamiales the flowers have a (usually) zygomorphic corolla whose petals are fused into a tube and there is no one character that separates a gesneriad from any other member of Lamiales. Gesneriads differ from related families of the Lamiales in having an unusual inflorescence structure, the &quot;pair-flowered cyme&quot;, but some gesneriads lack this characteristic, and some other Lamiales (Calceolariaceae and some Scrophulariaceae) share it. The ovary can be superior, half-inferior or fully inferior, and the fruit a dry or fleshy capsule or a berry. The seeds are always small and numerous. Gesneriaceae have traditionally been separated from Scrophulariaceae by having a unilocular rather than bilocular ovary, with parietal rather than axile placentation.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Gesneriaceae&quot; is a conserved name (&quot;nom. cons.&quot;), meaning that although alternative, less well used names for the family were published earlier, the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants specifies this as the name to be used. It was published by Louis Claude Richard and Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1816. In 1829, Barthélemy Dumortier divided the family into two tribes, based on the number of stamens. However, the only genus he placed in his two-stamen tribe, &quot;Columellia&quot;, is now placed in the separate family Columelliaceae. Dumortier&#x27;s publication has been treated as the first for the family by some sources.

Botanists who have made significant contributions to the systematics of the family are George Bentham, Robert Brown, B.L. Burtt, C.B. Clarke, Olive Mary Hilliard, Joseph Dalton Hooker, William Jackson Hooker, Karl Fritsch, Elmer Drew Merrill, Harold E. Moore Jr., John L. Clark, Conrad Vernon Morton, Henry Nicholas Ridley, Laurence Skog, W.T. Wang, Anton Weber, and Hans Wiehler. The Gesneriad Society is an international horticultural society devoted to the promotion, cultivation, and study of Gesneriaceae.

===Phylogeny===
From about 1997 onwards, molecular phylogenetic studies led to extensive changes in the classification of the family Gesneriaceae and its genera, many of which have been re-circumscribed or synonymized. New species are still being discovered, particularly in Asia, and may further change generic boundaries. A consensus phylogeny used to build classifications of the family in 2013 and 2020 is shown below (to the level of tribes). The family Calceolariaceae is shown as the sister to Gesneriaceae.

A phylogenomic study published in 2021 which used 418 nuclear genes confirmed the monophyly of all the subfamilies and tribes. It resolved &quot;Peltanthera&quot; as sister to a clade of Calceolariaceae and Gesneriaceae. Within the Gesnerioideae, Napeantheae rather than Titanotricheae was found to be sister to the remaining tribes. The position of Titanotricheae varied according to the method used to build the cladogram, which the authors suggested was due to incomplete lineage sorting following rapid divergence. The phylogenetic position of &quot;Titanotrichum&quot; remains unsettled.

The genus &quot;Sanango&quot; has not always been included in Gesneriaceae. However, molecular phylogenetic studies published up to and including 2021 suggest that it does belong in the family as the most basal member, and it is placed in its own subfamily. The studies also show the genus &quot;Peltanthera&quot; to be outside the family, although some sources still place it within the Gesneriaceae. The genus &quot;Rehmannia&quot; has also sometimes been included in the family but is now referred to the family Orobanchaceae.

No single morphological feature absolutely divides two main subfamilies (i.e. forms a uniform synapomorphy). Gesnerioideae seedlings have normal cotyledons of the same size and shape (isocotylous). The cotyledons of Didymocarpoideae are usually, but not always, eventually different in size and shape (anisocotylous). One cotyledon ceases to grow and withers away, while the other continues to grow, and may even form a very large leaf that is the only one the plant has (&quot;Monophyllaea&quot;, some &quot;Streptocarpus&quot;). Gesnerioideae flowers usually have four fertile stamens, rarely two or five. Didymocarpoideae flowers usually have two fertile stamens, less often four, rarely one or five.

===Subfamilies and genera===
On the basis of molecular phylogenetic, morphological and biogeographical differences, the family has been divided into two major subfamilies: subfamily Didymocarpoideae (formerly Cyrtandroideae) with all but one species from the Old World, and subfamily Gesnerioideae native from the Americas west through the Pacific to Australia and southeastern China. The genus &quot;Sanango&quot; is placed in its own subfamily, Sanangoideae. The two main subfamilies are further divided into tribes and subtribes.

Genera accepted by Plants of the World Online (PoWO) are listed below, together with their placement in a subfamily and tribe by Weber &quot;et al.&quot; (2020). Three genera are listed by PoWO but not by Weber &quot;et al.&quot;: &quot;Coptocheile&quot; (now treated as a synonym of &quot;Sinningia&quot;), &quot;Parakohleria&quot; (now included in &quot;Pearcea&quot;) and &quot;Peltanthera&quot; (excluded from Gesneriaceae by molecular phylogenetic studies).
==Ecology==
About half of the New World species (i.e. the subfamily Gesnerioideae) are co-adapted to bird pollination, particularly by hummingbirds in the Americas. Bird-pollinated species typically have two-lipped flowers in shades of red; examples are found in the genera &quot;Asteranthera&quot;, &quot;Columnea&quot; and &quot;Sinningia&quot;. Among Old World genera, &quot;Aeschynanthus&quot; has similar flowers.
==Cultivation==
Some genera in the family are grown as ornamental plants, both as garden plants and as houseplants. Such genera include: &quot;Aeschynanthus&quot;, &quot;Achimenes&quot;, &quot;Columnea&quot;, &quot;Gesneria&quot;, &quot;Haberlea&quot;, &quot;Nematanthus&quot; (syn. &quot;Hypocyrta&quot;), &quot;Ramonda&quot;, and &quot;Streptocarpus&quot; (Cape primroses, African violets). One of the most familiar members of the family to gardeners are the African violets in &quot;Streptocarpus&quot; section &quot;Saintpaulia&quot;. Gesneriads are divided culturally into three groups on the basis of whether, and how, their stems are modified into storage organs: rhizomatous, tuberous, and &quot;fibrous-rooted&quot;, meaning those that lack such storage structures (although all gesneriads have fibrous roots).

<text>A perpetual calendar is a calendar valid for many years, usually designed to look up the day of the week for a given date in the past or future.

For the Gregorian and Julian calendars, a perpetual calendar typically consists of one of three general variations:
# Fourteen one-year calendars, plus a table to show which one-year calendar is to be used for any given year. These one-year calendars divide evenly into two sets of seven calendars: seven for each common year (the year that does not have a February 29) with each of the seven starting on a different day of the week, and seven for each leap year, again with each one starting on a different day of the week, totaling fourteen. (See Dominical letter for one common naming scheme for the 14 calendars.)
# Seven (31-day) one-month calendars (or seven each of 28–31 day month lengths, for a total of 28) and one or more tables to show which calendar is used for any given month. Some perpetual calendars&#x27; tables slide against each other so that aligning two scales with one another reveals the specific month calendar via a pointer or window mechanism. The seven calendars may be combined into one, either with 13 columns of which only seven are revealed, or with movable day-of-week names (as shown in the pocket perpetual calendar picture).
# A mixture of the above two variations - a one-year calendar in which the names of the months are fixed and the days of the week and dates are shown on movable pieces which can be swapped around as necessary. 
Such a perpetual calendar fails to indicate the dates of moveable feasts such as Easter, which are calculated based on a combination of events in the tropical year and lunar cycles. These issues are dealt with in great detail in &quot;computus&quot;.

An early example of a perpetual calendar for practical use is found in the &quot;Nürnberger Handschrift GNM 3227a&quot;. The calendar covers the period of 1390–1495 (on which grounds the manuscript is dated to c. 1389). For each year of this period, it lists the number of weeks between Christmas and Quinquagesima. This is the first known instance of a tabular form of perpetual calendar allowing the calculation of the moveable feasts that became popular during the 15th century.

The chapel Cappella dei Mercanti, Turin contains a perpetual calendar machine made by Giovanni Plana using rotating drums.

== Other uses of the term &quot;perpetual calendar&quot; ==

Offices and retail establishments often display devices containing a set of elements to form all possible numbers from 1 through 31, as well as the names/abbreviations for the months and the days of the week, to show the current date for convenience of people who might be signing and dating documents such as checks. Establishments that serve alcoholic beverages may use a variant that shows the current month and day but subtracting the legal age of alcohol consumption in years, indicating the latest legal birth date for alcohol purchases. A common device consists of two cubes in a holder. One cube carries the digits zero to five. The other bears the digits 0, 1, 2, 6 (or 9 if inverted), 7, and 8. This is sufficient because only one and two may appear twice in date and they are on both cubes, while the 0 is on both cubes so that all single-digit dates can be shown in double-digit format. In addition to the two cubes, three blocks, each as wide as the two cubes combined, and a third as tall and as deep, have the names of the months printed on their long faces. The current month is turned forward on the front block, with the other two month blocks behind it.

Certain calendar reforms have been labeled perpetual calendars because their dates are fixed on the same weekdays every year. Examples are The World Calendar, the International Fixed Calendar and the Pax Calendar. Technically, these are not perpetual calendars but perennial calendars. Their purpose, in part, is to eliminate the need for perpetual calendar tables, algorithms, and computation devices.

In watchmaking, &quot;perpetual calendar&quot; describes a calendar mechanism that correctly displays the date on the watch &quot;perpetually&quot;, taking into account the different lengths of the months as well as leap years. The internal mechanism will move the dial to the next day.

== Algorithms ==
Perpetual calendars use algorithms to compute the day of the week for any given year, month, and day of the month. Even though the individual operations in the formulas can be very efficiently implemented in software, they are too complicated for most people to perform all of the arithmetic mentally. Perpetual calendar designers hide the complexity in tables to simplify their use.

A perpetual calendar employs a table for finding which of fourteen yearly calendars to use. A table for the Gregorian calendar expresses its 400-year grand cycle: 303 common years and 97 leap years total to 146,097 days, or exactly 20,871 weeks. This cycle breaks down into one 100-year period with 25 leap years, making 36,525 days, or &quot;one&quot; day less than 5,218 full weeks; and three 100-year periods with 24 leap years each, making 36,524 days, or &quot;two&quot; days less than 5,218 full weeks.

Within each 100-year block, the cyclic nature of the Gregorian calendar proceeds in the same fashion as its Julian predecessor: A common year begins and ends on the same day of the week, so the following year will begin on the next successive day of the week. A leap year has one more day, so the year following a leap year begins on the &quot;second&quot; day of the week after the leap year began. Every four years, the starting weekday advances five days, so over a 28-year period, it advances 35, returning to the same place in both the leap year progression and the starting weekday. This cycle completes three times in 84 years, leaving 16 years in the fourth, incomplete cycle of the century.

A major complicating factor in constructing a perpetual calendar algorithm is the peculiar and variable length of February, which was at one time the &quot;last&quot; month of the year, leaving the first 11 months March through January with a five-month repeating pattern: 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, ..., so that the offset from March of the starting day of the week for any month could be easily determined. Zeller&#x27;s congruence, a well-known algorithm for finding the day of the week for any date, explicitly defines January and February as the &quot;13th&quot; and &quot;14th&quot; months of the &quot;previous&quot; year to take advantage of this regularity, but the month-dependent calculation is still very complicated for mental arithmetic:
:formula_1

Instead, a table-based perpetual calendar provides a simple lookup mechanism to find offset for the day of the week for the first day of each month. To simplify the table, in a leap year January and February must either be treated as a separate year or have extra entries in the month table:

<text> (, Protection Force) was the official name of the colonial troops in the African territories of the German colonial empire from the late 19th century to 1918. Similar to other colonial armies, the consisted of volunteer European commissioned and non-commissioned officers, medical and veterinary officers. Most enlisted ranks were recruited from indigenous communities within the German colonies or from elsewhere in Africa.

Military contingents were formed in German East Africa, where they became famous as , in the Kamerun colony of German West Africa, and in German South West Africa. Control of the German colonies of New Guinea, in Samoa, and in Togoland was performed by small local police detachments. Kiautschou in China under Imperial Navy administration was a notable exception. As part of the East Asian Station the navy garrisoned Qingdao with the marines of III, the only all-German unit with permanent status in an overseas protectorate.

==Deployment==

The name of the German colonial force dates back to the parlance of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who had the term , &quot;protectorates&quot;, used instead of colonies. contingents arose from local police forces or private paramilitary units, where German colonizers met with stronger resistance.

When in 1888 the Abushiri revolt broke out in the dominions of the German East Africa Company, Bismarck&#x27;s government in Berlin had to send mercenary troops under Hermann Wissmann to subdue the uprising. Upon the establishment of German East Africa, this was changed to by an act of the Reichstag parliament on 22 March 1891. The police forces for South-West Africa under Curt von François and for German Cameroon were re-established as by the act of 9 June 1895.

 formations under the supreme command of the German Emperor were organizationally never a part of the Imperial German Army, though German military law and discipline applied to its units. Initially supervised by the Imperial Navy Office, they were under the authority of the Colonial Department in the German Foreign Office by the act of 7 and 18 July 1896. In 1907 the Colonial Department with the command was set up as the independent Imperial Colonial Office () agency directly answerable to the Chancellor of Germany.

In 1896 a central command () was established as part of the Colonial Department. Despite its name, this agency exercised no military leadership but served as an administrative authority. It was located at Berlin’s Mauerstrasse, in proximity to the Colonial Office. At the beginning of the First World War in 1914, there were three military commands, one in each of the German colonial regions in East Africa, South-West Africa, and in Kamerun, subordinate to each governor.

==German East Africa==


At the outbreak of the First World War, the in German East Africa was organised into 14 field companies () with 2,500 men under arms, with headquarters at the capital Dar es Salaam. Including carriers and labourers, the force had about 14,000 personnel. On 13 April 1914, Lieutenant Colonel Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck assumed command in German East Africa. He led his units throughout the First World War, eventually being promoted to . The in East Africa became the last German formation to surrender – days after the armistice of 11 November 1918.

A pre-war company consisted of 160 (expandable to 200) men in three platoons () of 50 to 60 men each, including two machine-gun teams. Each of the 14 companies also had a minimum 250 man carrier contingent as well as native irregulars known as &quot;Ruga-Ruga&quot;, called Fita-Fita in German Samoa, of approximately the same size units.
* 1st Company (): Arusha/Neu Moshi
* 2nd Company: Iringa and Unbena
* 3rd Company: Lindi
* 4th Company: Kilimatinde and Singida (Dodoma ?)
* 5th Company: Massoko (Langenburg)
* 6th Company: Udjidiji and Kassulo
* 7th Company: Bukoba, Ussuwi and Kifumbiro
* 8th Company: Tabora
* 9th Company: Usumbura
* 10th Company: Dar es Salaam
* 11th Company: Kissenji and Mruhengeri
* 12th Company: Mahenge
* 13th Company: Kondoa Irangi
* 14th Company: Muansa and Ikoma

The Dar es Salaam garrison further included a recruitment depot, a signals department and quartermaster unit.

Overall strength was 300 European recruits and 2,472 Africans, specifically 68 combatant officers, 60 warrant officers and NCOs, 132 non-combatant medical officers, civilian administrators, ammunition technicians, and 2 African officers and 184 African NCOs and 2,286 . Lastly there was the Polizietruppe, formed in 1909, with 60 German and around 2,000 experienced askari which was reintegrated into the Schutztruppe as soon as war erupted.

During the First World War, companies numbered 15 through 30 were added, plus eight (A through G, and L) temporary companies; and 1st through 10th [rifle companies]. The were originally composed of white settlers, their sons, plantations administrators and trading company employees but some units became racially mixed as the war dragged on. Numerous other small detachments were also formed. Several, possibly four, Reserve were also raised consisting of older , they were prefixed by the letter &quot;R&quot;.

==German South West Africa==


The in German South West Africa was structured in 12 companies of mounted infantry totalling 1,500 men, primarily Germans. The 7th Company, stationed in the northern desert area of the colony, was mounted on imported camels. A single unit, called the Baster Company, consisting of non-local biracial white European-black Africans, was raised and deployed. Relations between the German administration and the natives in this colony had deteriorated to the point that few local Africans were recruited. Some Boers and Afrikaners were able to be recruited, bolstering the fledgling force.

The colonial forces for German Southwest Africa consisted of volunteers from the Imperial Army and Navy (including some Austrians) but essentially consisted of members of German regiments. Before their deployment to Africa these troops were prepared for their special tasks and future environment. Such a training base was at Karlsruhe. Because of the often humid conditions in the upper Rhine valley of the Grand Duchy of Baden, the area provided some early acclimatisation.

The structure of the South West African forces was as follows:

German South West Africa Command at Windhuk (modern Windhoek) consisted of headquarters, administration and legal (judge advocate), medical corps, surveying and mapping units.

Northern district command: Windhuk
* 1st Company: Regenstein, Seeis
* 4th Company: Okanjande
* 6th Company: Outjo and Otavi
* 2nd Battery: Johann-Albrechts-Höhe
* Transport platoon 1: Karibib
* Office for provisions: Karibib
* Horse depot: Okawayo
* Artillery and train depot: Windhuk
* Military hospital and medical depot: Windhuk
* Clothing depot: Windhuk
* Local headquarters: Windhuk
* Local headquarters and quartermaster: Swakopmund
Southern district command: Keetmanshoop
* 2nd Company: Ukamas
* 3rd Company: Kanus
* 5th Company: Chamis and Churutabis
* 7th and 8th Company (camel cavalry), military hospital: Gochas and Arahoab
* 1st Battery: Narubis
* 3rd Battery: Gibeon
* Transport platoon 2: Keetmanshoop
* Artillery and train depot: Keetmanshoop
* Military hospital and medical depot: Keetmanshoop
* Clothing depot: Keetmanshoop
* Office for provisions: Keetmanshoop
* Garrison administration: Keetmanshoop
* Horse depot: Aus
* Camel stud farm: Kalkfontain
* Local headquarters and quartermaster: Lüderitz

At the outbreak of the war the force had a total strength of 91 officers, 22 physicians, 9 veterinarians, 59 civilian administrators, ammunition technicians, 342 NCOs and 1,444 German other ranks for a total of 1,967 personnel.

==German West Africa==
===Kamerun===

German West Africa encompassed two colonial entities, Kamerun and Togoland.

The Kamerun force in 1914 consisted of 12 companies, totalling 1,600 men with headquarters at Soppo and established in 1894 from the existing police force (formed in 1891).

The structure of the Kamerun forces was as follows:

Central Command: Soppo near the capital Buea
* 1st Company (headquarters company) and artillery detachment: Douala
* 2nd Company: Bamenda, Wum and Kentu
* 3rd Company: Mora and Kusseri
* 4th Company: (expedition/survey company): Soppo
* 5th Company: Bouar, Carnot and Ebolowa
* 6th Company: Mbaiki, Nola and Nguku
* 7th Company: Garua, Marua, Mubi
* 8th Company: Ngaundere
* 9th Company: Dume and Baturi
* 10th Company: Ojem and Mimwoul
* 11th Company: Akoafim and Minkebe
* 12th Company: Bumo, Fianga, and Gore
The companies were assigned to 49 garrisons in Kamerun and consisted of 61 officers, 23 physicians, 23 civilian administrators, ammunition technicians, 98 German NCOs and 1,650 African enlisted ranks for a total personnel count of 1,855.

===Togoland===
Togoland had a total police force of 673 personnel deployed throughout the colony. Approximately 1,000 troops were raised after the outbreak of the war. With very little arms, ammunition, or provisions, by the end of August 1914, all units had surrendered to French and British forces.

==Appearance==

When the Schutztruppe for German East Africa was founded in 1891, special uniforms were created which, among other things, were intended to underline the special position of the Schutztruppe as an independent part of the Reichsheer. The uniforms corresponded to the cut of the Prussian Army, initially in grey but later in &quot;field gray&quot; for home service (&quot;Tuchuniform&quot;/&quot;Tuchrock&quot;) or khaki (&quot;Feldrock&quot;) for the tropics. Schutztruppen in Southwest Africa could wear the home service uniform in the protectorate. A khaki service dress was worn by all ranks while a white dress uniform was worn by European officers and NCOs for ceremonial occasions, both white and khaki uniforms were cut the same with four patch pockets and a stand and fall collar. The Schutztruppe arm of service color was blue so their uniforms were trimmed blue down the trousers seam, the fly of their tunic, collar edge, plus NCO&#x27;s wore silver on blue inverted chevrons on the left sleeve only They were also supplied a grey or khaki slouch hat called the Schutztruppenhut (aka Südwester) on which the edge of the hat and the cap band were in the color of the respective Schutztruppe. The protectorate colours were as follows; German East Africa white, Cameroon dark red, German South West Africa cornflower blue, Togo yellow, German New Guinea green, German Samoa light pink. Additionally, as Imperial Troops, the &#x27;Reichskokarde&#x27; cockade in black, white and red was worn on the folded brim of the Schutztruppenhut, a black, white and red cord could be worn around the tropical helmet (Tropenhelm), and black, white and red intertwined shoulder straps were worn on both tunic shoulders.

&quot;Schutztruppe&quot; Askaris wore a pocketless cotton khaki tunic and breeches with blue puttees and ankle boots, which replaced bare lower legs and feet. African personnel also wore a red fez over which a khaki cover could be worn in the field. Company numbers were often worn on the front of the fez. In field conditions the askari wore either a khaki cover over their red fez or a khaki tarbush consisting of a khaki cloth over a wicker frame. Later in the war African troops wore a large floppy hat en lieu of the fez. The arm of service color for African/native troops was red so their uniforms, when trimmed, were trimmed red down the trousers seam, the tunic fly, collar edge, plus NCO&#x27;s wore red, later brown, chevrons on the left sleeve only.

==Ranks and insignia==

The rank insignia of Africans differed by one chevron from German ranks (eg. a German Gefreiter wore no chevrons, an African wore one, a German Unteroffizier wore one chevron, and African wore two etc). Despite them having nominally similar ranks, European NCOs always outranked Native NCOs.

German/European Ranks: Standard Imperial Army collar and or shoulder rank insignia was worn by German/European Officers and men.
===German East Africa===
Many of the original East African Askaris were Sudanese therefore the East African Schutztruppen utilized existing Turkish rank titles. The following ranks existed for East African other ranks:
* Effendi - Sudanese officers (East Africa only) inherited from the Wissmann-Truppe - originally wore one to three, but later only three, silver stars on the shoulder straps
* Senior Sergeant - Feldwebel/Sol - four flat-topped inverted chevrons
* Sergeant - Sargenten/Bet Schausch - three flat-topped inverted chevrons
* Corporal - Unteroffizier/Schausch - two flat-topped inverted chevrons
* Private - Gefreiter/Ombascha - one flat-topped inverted chevron

<text>The Monastery of the Cross (, &quot;Dayr al-Salīb&quot;; ; , , &quot;jvris monast&#x27;eri&quot;) is an Eastern Orthodox monastery near the Nayot neighborhood of Jerusalem. It is located in the Valley of the Cross, below the Israel Museum and the Knesset.

==Tradition==
Legend has it that the monastery was erected on the burial spot of Adam&#x27;s head—though two other locations in Jerusalem also claim this honor—from which grew the tree that gave its wood to the cross on which Christ was crucified.

==History==
===Late Roman/Byzantine period===
It is believed that the site was originally consecrated in the fourth century under the instruction of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great, who later gave the site to king Mirian III of Kartli after the conversion of his kingdom to Christianity in AD 327. Archaeologists have established that the first basilica was built at the end of the fourth century.  As the founder of the church, scholars name Bakur, an Iberian prince, grandfather of the famous Peter of Iberia, who held the position of Dux Palestinae at that time. Remains from the fourth century are sparse, the most important of which is a fragment of a mosaic.

===Early Muslim period===
The monastery was built in the eleventh century, during the reign of King Bagrat IV by the Georgian monk Prochorus the Iberian.

===Crusader period===
The remains of the Crusader-period monastery forms a small part of the current complex, most of which has undergone restoration and rebuilding. The crusader section houses a church, including a grotto where a window into the ground below allows viewing of the spot where, reputedly, the tree from which the cross was fashioned grew.

===Mamluk period===
Under Sultan Baybars (1260–77) the monks were executed after being accused of being spies for the Ilkhanate Mongols, who had recently destroyed Baghdad. In 1305, an ambassador of the King of Georgia, supported by Andronikos II, to Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad achieved repossession of the monastery.

In the early 1480s Felix Fabri described it: &quot;...we came to fair church, adjoining which is a small monastery, wherein dwell Georgian monks with their wives. When we entered into the church, we were led up to the high altar, which is said to stand on the very spot where grew the tree of the holy cross.&quot;

===Ottoman period===
In the early 1600s, Franciscus Quaresmius described it as: &quot;beautiful and spacious, paved with mosaic work and embellished with various Greek pictures. Moreover, the monastery is now indeed large, fortified and commodious; but formerly it was much larger, as its ruins demonstrate.&quot;

Due to heavy debt, the Georgians sold the monastery to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch Dositheos II in 1685. It is currently occupied by monks of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem.

In 1697 Henry Maundrell noted: &quot;a Convent of the Greeks, taking its name from the holy Cross. This convent is very neat in its structure, and in its situation delightful. But that which most deserves to be noted in it, is the reason for its name, and foundation. It is because here is the Earth, that nourished the Root, that bore the Tree, that yielded the Timber that made the Cross. Under the high Altar you are shown a hole in the ground where the stump of the Tree stood, [..] 
After our return, we were invited into the Convent, to have our feet washed. A ceremony performed to each Pilgrim by the Father Guardian himself. The whole society stands round singing some Latin Hymns, and when he has done, every Fryar comes in order, and kisses the feet of the Pilgrim: all this was performed with great order, and solemnity.&quot;

===Modern period===
====Georgian inscriptions painted over====
In the 1970s and 1980s, the Georgian inscriptions were painted over and replaced by Greek ones. In a 1901 photograph showing the mural of the Council of Archangels, Georgian inscriptions are visible, but 1960 photographs show that the inscriptions had been changed to Greek; after cleaning the paintings the Georgian inscriptions emerged again. The same happened in the case of the Christ Anapeson, the &quot;reclining Jesus&quot;. In many places (e.g. near the figures of St. Luke and St. Prochore) the outline of Georgian letters are clearly visible under the recently added Greek inscriptions.

====Rustaveli portrait: defaced and restored====

In June 2004, shortly before a visit by the Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili to Israel, a fresco of the legendary Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli on a column inside the church was defaced by unknown individuals. It is the only extant medieval portrait of Rustaveli. The face and part of the accompanying inscription were scratched out. Georgia officially complained to Israel after the incident. The fresco was restored by Israeli specialists, based on good existing documentation.

==== Vandalism ====
The monastery has been the target of repeated acts of vandalism. On February 7, 2012, suspected Jewish extremists spray painted graffiti calling for &quot;death to Christians&quot; in what is described as price tag attack. On December 12, 2012, the Jewish settler hate group defaced the monastery yet again along with desecration of an Armenian cemetery.

==Description, visit==
The fortified monastery comprises a church and living quarters. The church contains ancient murals and inside a side chapel one can see a hole in the ground where, according to tradition, the tree once grew from which the Holy Cross was fashioned.

The library houses many Georgian manuscripts.

Visitors can also access a museum and gift shop.
