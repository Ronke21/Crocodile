<text>İzmir is the third most populous city in Turkey, after Istanbul and Ankara. It is on the Aegean coast of Anatolia, and is the capital of İzmir Province. In 2019, the city of İzmir had a population of 2,965,900, while İzmir Province had a total population of 4,367,251. Its built-up (or metro) area was home to 3,209,179 inhabitants. It extends along the outlying waters of the Gulf of İzmir and inland to the north across the Gediz River Delta; to the east along an alluvial plain created by several small streams; and to slightly more rugged terrain in the south.

İzmir has more than 3,000 years of recorded urban history, and up to 8,500 years of history as a human settlement since the Neolithic period. In classical antiquity, the city was known as Smyrna – a name which remained in use in English and various other languages until around 1930, when government efforts led the original Greek name to be gradually phased out internationally in favor of its Turkish counterpart .

Lying on an advantageous location at the head of a gulf running down in a deep indentation, midway along the western Anatolian coast, İzmir has been one of the principal mercantile cities of the Mediterranean Sea for much of its history. Until the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, İzmir had a very large Greek population. It hosted the Mediterranean Games in 1971 and the World University Games (Universiade) in 2005.

== Names and etymology ==
In ancient Anatolia, the name of a locality called &quot;Ti-smurna&quot; is mentioned in some of the Level II tablets from the Assyrian colony in Kültepe (first half of the 2nd millennium BC), with the prefix &quot;ti-&quot; identifying a proper name, although it is not established with certainty that this name refers to modern-day İzmir.

The modern name &quot;İzmir&quot; is the Turkish rendering of the Greek name &quot;Smyrna&quot; ( ; ). In medieval times, Westerners used forms like &quot;Smire&quot;, &quot;Zmirra&quot;, &quot;Esmira&quot;, &quot;Ismira&quot;, which was rendered as &quot;İzmir&quot; into Turkish, originally written as with the Ottoman Turkish alphabet.

The region of İzmir was situated on the southern fringes of the Yortan culture in Anatolia&#x27;s prehistory, knowledge of which is almost entirely drawn from its cemeteries. In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, it was in the western end of the extension of the still largely obscure Arzawa Kingdom, an offshoot and usually a dependency of the Hittites, who themselves spread their direct rule as far as the coast during their Great Kingdom. That the realm of the 13th century BC local Luwian ruler, who is depicted in the Kemalpaşa Karabel rock carving at a distance of only from İzmir was called the &quot;Kingdom of Myra&quot; may also leave grounds for association with the city&#x27;s name.

The latest known rendering in Greek of the city&#x27;s name is the Aeolic Greek &quot;Mýrrha&quot;, corresponding to the later Ionian and Attic (&quot;Smýrna&quot;) or (&quot;Smýrnē&quot;), both presumably descendants of a Proto-Greek form . Some would see in the city&#x27;s name a reference to the name of an Amazon called Smyrna said to have seduced Theseus, leading him to name the city in her honor. Others link the name to the &quot;Myrrha commifera&quot; shrub, a plant producing the aromatic resin called &quot;myrrh&quot; that is indigenous to the Middle East and northeastern Africa, which was the city&#x27;s chief export in antiquity. The Romans took over this name as &quot;Smyrna&quot;, which is still the name used in English when referring to the city in pre-Turkish times. In Ottoman Turkish the town&#x27;s name was &quot;Izmīr&quot;.

In English, the city was called Smyrna into the 20th century. &quot;Izmir&quot; (sometimes &quot;İzmir&quot;) was adopted in English and most foreign languages after Turkey adopted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city&#x27;s Turkish name. However, the historic name &quot;Smyrna&quot; is still used today in some languages, such as Italian (), and Catalan, Portuguese, and Spanish ().

== History ==
=== Prehistory and ancient history ===

The city is one of the oldest settlements of the Mediterranean basin. The 2004 discovery of Yeşilova Höyük and the neighboring Yassıtepe, in the small delta of Meles River, now the Bornova plain, reset the starting date of the city&#x27;s past further back than previously thought. Findings from two seasons of excavations carried out in the Yeşilova Höyük by a team of archaeologists from İzmir&#x27;s Ege University indicate three levels, two of which are prehistoric. Level 2 bears traces of early to mid-Chalcolithic, and Level 3 of Neolithic settlements. These two levels would have been inhabited by the indigenous peoples of the area, very roughly, between the 7th millennium BC and the 4th millennium BC. As the seashore receded with time, the site was later used as a cemetery. Several graves containing artifacts dating roughly from 3000 BC, and contemporary with the first city of Troy, were found.

The first settlement to have commanded the Gulf of İzmir as a whole was established on top of Mount Yamanlar, to the northeast of the inner gulf. In connection with the silt brought by the streams which join the sea along the coastline, the settlement to form later the core of &quot;Old Smyrna&quot; was founded on the slopes of the same mountain, on a hill (&quot;then a small peninsula connected to the mainland by a small isthmus&quot;) in the present-day neighborhood of Tepekule in Bayraklı. The Bayraklı settlement is thought to have stretched back in time as far as the 3rd millennium BC. Archaeological findings of the late Bronze Age show a certain degree of Mycenaean influence in the settlement and the surrounding region, though further excavations of Bronze Age layers are needed to propose Old Smyrna of that time as a Mycenaean settlement. In the 13th century BC, however, invasions from the Balkans (the so-called Sea Peoples) destroyed Troy VII, and Central and Western Anatolia as a whole fell into what is generally called the period of &quot;Anatolian&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot; Dark Ages of the Bronze Age collapse.

==== Old Smyrna ====

At the dawn of İzmir&#x27;s recorded history, Pausanias describes &quot;evident tokens&quot; such as &quot;a port called after the name of Tantalus and a sepulcher of him by no means obscure&quot;, corresponding to the city&#x27;s area and which have been tentatively located to date. The term &quot;Old Smyrna&quot; is used to describe the Archaic Period city located at Tepekule, Bayraklı, to make a distinction with the city of Smyrna rebuilt later on the slopes of Mount Pagos (present-day Kadifekale). The Greek settlement in Old Smyrna is attested by the presence of pottery dating from about 1000 BC onwards. The most ancient preserved ruins date back to 725–700 BC. According to Herodotus the city was founded by Aeolians and later seized by Ionians. The oldest house discovered in Bayraklı has been dated to 925 and 900 BC. The walls of this well-preserved house (), consisting of one small room typical of the Iron Age, were made of sun-dried bricks and the roof of the house was made of reeds. A house found in Old Smyrna with two floors and five rooms with a courtyard, built in the second half of the 7th century BC, is the oldest known house having so many rooms under its roof. Around that time, people started to build thick, protective ramparts made of sun-dried bricks around the city. Smyrna was built on the Hippodamian system, in which streets run north-south and east-west and intersect at right angles, in a pattern familiar in the Near East but the earliest example in a western city. The houses all faced south. The most ancient paved streets in the Ionian civilization have also been discovered in ancient Smyrna. 

Homer, referred to as &quot;Melesigenes&quot; meaning &quot;Child of the Meles Brook&quot;, is said to have been born in Smyrna in the 7th or 8th century BC. Combined with written evidence, it is generally admitted that Smyrna and Chios put forth the strongest arguments in claiming Homer and the main belief is that he was born in Ionia. The River Meles, still bearing the same name, is located within the city limits, although associations with the Homeric river is subject to controversy.

From the 7th century onwards, Smyrna achieved the identity of a city-state. About a thousand people lived inside the city walls, with others living in nearby villages, where fields, olive trees, vineyards, and the workshops of potters and stonecutters were located. People generally made their living from agriculture and fishing. The most important sanctuary of Old Smyrna was the Temple of Athena, which dates back to 640–580 BC and is partially restored today. Smyrna, by this point, was no longer a small town, but an urban center taking part in the Mediterranean trade. The city eventually became one of the twelve Ionian cities and was well on its way to becoming a foremost cultural and commercial center in the Mediterranean basin of that period, reaching its peak between 650–545 BC. 

==== Lydian rule ====
The city&#x27;s port position near their capital drew the Lydians to Smyrna. The army of Lydia&#x27;s Mermnad dynasty conquered the city sometime around 610–600 BC and is reported to have burned and destroyed parts of the city, although recent analyses on the remains in Bayraklı demonstrate that the temple had been in continuous use or was very quickly repaired under the Lydian rule.

==== Persian rule ====
Soon afterwards, an invasion from outside Anatolia by the Persian Empire effectively ended Old Smyrna&#x27;s history as an urban center of note. The Persian emperor Cyrus the Great attacked the coastal cities of the Aegean after conquering the capital of Lydia. As a result, Old Smyrna was destroyed in 545 BC.

====Alexander the Great====
Alexander the Great re-founded the city at a new location beyond the Meles River around 340 BC. Alexander had defeated the Persians in several battles and finally the Emperor Darius III himself at Issus in 333 BC. Old Smyrna on a small hill by the sea was large enough only for a few thousand people. Therefore, the slopes of Mount Pagos (Kadifekale) were chosen for the foundation of the new city, for which Alexander is credited, and this act laid the ground for a resurgence in the city&#x27;s population.

==== Roman rule ====
In 133 BC, Eumenes III, the last king of the Attalid Kingdom of Pergamon, was about to die without an heir. In his will, he bequeathed his kingdom to the Roman Republic, and this included Smyrna. The city thus came under Roman rule as a civil diocese within the Province of Asia and enjoyed a new period of prosperity. Towards the close of the 1st century, Smyrna was one of the seven churches of Asia mentioned in Revelation 2:9. John the Apostle urged his followers to remain Christians in Revelations 2:10: &quot;Be faithful to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life&quot;.

Given the importance of the city, Roman emperors who came to Anatolia also visited Smyrna. In early 124, Emperor Hadrian visited Smyrna on his journeys across the Empire and possibly Caracalla came in 214–215. Smyrna was a fine city with stone-paved streets.

In 178, the city was devastated by an earthquake. Emperor Marcus Aurelius contributed greatly to its rebuilding. During this period, the agora was restored. Many of the works of architecture from the city&#x27;s pre-Turkish period date from this period.

After the Roman Empire was divided into two distinct entities, Smyrna became a territory of the Eastern Roman Empire. It remained a notable religious center in the early Byzantine period but never returned to Roman levels of prosperity.

=== Medieval period ===
The Turkic peoples first captured Smyrna under the Seljuk commander Çaka Bey, called Tzachas by the Byzantines, in 1076, along with Klazomenai, Foça and a number of the Aegean Islands. Çaka Bey used İzmir as a base for his naval operations. In 1097, the Byzantine commander John Doukas recaptured the city and the neighboring region. The port city was then captured by the Knights of St John when Constantinople was conquered by the Crusaders during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, but the Nicaean Empire would reclaim possession of the city soon afterward, albeit by giving vast concessions to their Genoese allies, who kept one of the city&#x27;s castles and the lordship of the towns of Old Phocaea and New Phocaea (now part of the İzmir Province) from 1275 to 1340.

Smyrna was captured again in the 14th century by Umur Bey, the son of the founder of the Beylik of Aydın who first took the upper fort of Mount Pagos (after that called Kadifekale), and then the lower port castle of Neon Kastron (called &quot;St. Peter&quot; by the Genoese and &quot;Ok Kalesi&quot; by the Turks). As Çaka Bey had done two centuries before, Umur Bey used the city as a base for naval raids. In 1344, a coalition of forces coordinated by Pope Clement VI took back the lower castle in a surprise attack in the Smyrniote crusades. Sixty years of uneasy cohabitation between the two powers, the Beyliks holding the upper castle and the Knights the lower, followed by Umur Bey&#x27;s death in 1348.

=== Ottoman period ===

The upper city of İzmir was captured from its Aydinid rulers by the Ottomans for the first time in 1389 during the reign of Bayezid I, who led his armies toward the five Western Anatolian Beyliks in the winter of the same year he had come to the throne. In 1402, however, Timur (Tamerlane) won the Battle of Ankara against the Ottomans, putting a serious check on the Ottoman state for the two following decades and handing back the territories of most of the Beyliks to their former ruling dynasties. Timur attacked and destroyed Smyrna and was responsible for the massacre of most of the Christian population, which constituted the vast majority in Smyrna. In 1415, Mehmet I took back İzmir for the Ottomans for the second time. With the death of the last bey of Aydın, İzmiroğlu Cüneyd Bey, in 1426 the city passed fully under Ottoman control. İzmir&#x27;s first Ottoman governor was Alexander, a converted son of the Bulgarian Shishman dynasty. During the campaigns against Cüneyd, the Ottomans were assisted by the forces of the Knights Hospitaller who pressed the Sultan to return the port castle to them. However, the sultan refused to make this concession, despite the resulting tensions between the two camps, and he gave the Hospitallers permission to build a castle (the present-day Bodrum Castle) in Petronium (Bodrum) instead.

In a landward-looking arrangement somewhat against its nature, the city and its present-day dependencies became an Ottoman sanjak (&quot;sub-province&quot;) either inside the larger vilayet (&quot;province&quot;) of Aydın part of the eyalet of Anatolia, with its capital in Kütahya or in &quot;Cezayir&quot; (i.e. &quot;Islands&quot; referring to &quot;the Aegean Islands&quot;). In the 15th century, two notable events for the city were a surprise Venetian raid in 1475 and the arrival of Sephardic Jews from Spain after 1492; they later made İzmir one of their principal urban centers in Ottoman lands. İzmir may have been a rather sparsely populated place in the 15th and 16th centuries, as indicated by the first extant Ottoman records describing the town dating from 1528. In 1530, 304 adult males, both tax-paying and tax-exempt were on record, 42 of them Christians. There were five urban wards, one of these situated in the immediate vicinity of the port, rather active despite the town&#x27;s small size and where the non-Muslim population was concentrated. By 1576, İzmir had grown to house 492 taxpayers in eight urban wards and had a number of dependent villages. This corresponded to a total population estimated between 3500 and 5000.

==== International port city ====

İzmir&#x27;s remarkable growth began in the late 16th century when cotton and other products of the region brought French, English, Dutch and Venetian traders here. The emergence of İzmir as a major international port by the 17th century was largely a result of the attraction it exercised over foreigners and the city&#x27;s European orientation. With the privileged trading conditions accorded to foreigners in 1620 (these were the infamous &quot;capitulations&quot; that were later to cause a serious threat and setback for the Ottoman state in its decline), İzmir began to be one of the foremost trade centers of the Empire. Foreign consulates moved from Chios to the city by the early 17th century (1619 for the French Consulate, 1621 for the British), serving as trade centers for their nations. Each consulate had its own quay, where the ships under their flag would anchor. The long campaign for the conquest of Crete (22 years between 1648 and 1669) also considerably enhanced İzmir&#x27;s position within the Ottoman realm since the city served as a port of dispatch and supply for the troops. İzmir was also one of the few Ottoman port cities which had a maritime flag.

Despite facing a plague in 1676, an earthquake in 1688, and a great fire in 1743, the city continued to grow. By the end of the 17th century, the population was estimated at around ninety thousand, the Turks forming the majority (about 60,000); there were also 15,000 Greeks, 8,000 Armenians and 6,000 to 7,000 Jews, as well as a considerable section made up of French, English, Dutch and Italian merchants. In the meantime, the Ottomans had allowed İzmir&#x27;s inner bay dominated by the port castle to silt up progressively (the location of the present-day Kemeraltı bazaar zone) and the port castle ceased to be of use.

In 1770, the Ottoman fleet was destroyed by Russian forces at the Battle of Çeşme, located near the city. This triggered fanatical Muslim groups to proceed to the massacre of c. 1,500 local Greeks. Later, in 1797 a riot resulting from the indiscipline of janissaries corps led to massive destruction of the Frankish merchant community and the killing of 1,500 members of the city&#x27;s Greek community. In 1818, traveller William Jowett described the distribution of Smyrna (now İzmir)&#x27;s population: Turks 60,000, Greeks 40,000, Jews 10,000, Latins 3,000, Armenians 7,000.

The first railway lines to be built within the present-day territory of Turkey went from İzmir. A İzmir-Aydın railway was started in 1856 and finished in 1867, a year later than the Smyrna-Cassaba Railway, itself started in 1863. In 1865 the population was estimated by the British (Hyde Clarke) at 180,000 with minorities of 80,000 Greeks, 8,000 Armenians and 10,000 Jews. The wide arc of the Smyrna-Cassaba line advancing in a wide arc to the north-west from İzmir, through the Karşıyaka suburb, contributed greatly to the development of the northern shores as urban areas. These new developments, typical of the industrial age and the way the city attracted merchants and middlemen gradually changed the demographic structure of the city, its culture and its Ottoman character. In 1867, İzmir finally became the center of its own vilayet, still called by neighboring Aydın&#x27;s name but with its own administrative area covering a large part of Turkey&#x27;s present-day Aegean Region.

In the late 19th century, the port was threatened by a build-up of silt in the gulf and an initiative, unique in the history of the Ottoman Empire, was undertaken in 1886. In order to redirect the silt, the bed of the Gediz River was redirected to its present-day northern course, so that it no longer flowed into the gulf. The beginning of the 20th century saw İzmir take on the look of a global metropolis with a cosmopolitan city center. According to the 1893 Ottoman census, more than half of the population was Turkish, with 133,800 Greeks, 9,200 Armenians, 17,200 Jews, and 54,600 foreign nationals. According to author Katherine Flemming, by 1919, Smyrna&#x27;s 150,000 Greeks made up just under half of the population, outnumbering the Turks in the city two to one, while the American Consul General, George Horton, records 165,000 Turks, 150,000 Greeks, 25,000 Jews, 25,000 Armenians, and 20,000 foreigners (Italians, French, British, Americans). According to Henry Morgenthau and Trudy Ring, before World War I, the Greeks alone numbered 130,000, out of a total population of 250,000. Moreover, according to various scholars, prior to the war, the city hosted more Greeks than Athens, the capital of Greece. The Ottoman ruling class of that era referred to the city as &quot;Infidel Smyrna&quot; (Gavur İzmir) due to its strong Greek presence.

=== Contemporary period ===
Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the victors had, for a time, intended to carve up large parts of Anatolia into respective zones of influence and offered the western regions of Turkey to Greece under the Treaty of Sèvres. On 15 May 1919, the Greek Army landed in Smyrna, but the Greek expedition towards central Anatolia was disastrous for both that country and for the local Greeks of Anatolia. By September 1922 the Greek army had been defeated and the last Greek soldiers left Smyrna on 8 September 1922.

The Turkish Army retook possession of the city on 9 September 1922, effectively ending the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). Four days later, on 13 September 1922, a great fire broke out in the city, lasting until . The fire completely destroyed the Greek and Armenian quarters, while the Muslim and Jewish quarters escaped damage. Estimated Greek and Armenians deaths resulting from the fire range from 10,000 to 100,000 Approximately 50,000 to 400,000 Greek and Armenian refugees crammed the waterfront to escape from the fire and were forced to remain there under harsh conditions for nearly two weeks. The systematic evacuation of Greeks on the quay started on 24 September when the first Greek ships entered the harbor under the supervision of Allied destroyers. Some 150,000 to 200,000 Greeks were evacuated in total. The remaining Greeks were expelled to Greece in 1923, as part of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, a stipulation of the Treaty of Lausanne, which formally ended the Greco-Turkish War.

The war, and especially the events that took place in İzmir, such as the fire, probably the greatest disaster the city has ever experienced, continue to influence the psyches of the two nations to this day. The Turks have claimed that the Greek army landing was marked from the very first day by the &quot;first bullet&quot; fired on Greek detachments by the journalist Hasan Tahsin and the bayonetting to death of Colonel Fethi Bey and his unarmed soldiers in the city&#x27;s historic barracks (&quot;Sarı Kışla — the Yellow Barracks&quot;), for refusing to shout &quot;&quot;Zito o Venizelos&quot; (&quot;Long Live Venizelos&quot;). The Greeks, on the other hand, have cited the numerous atrocities committed by the Turkish soldiers against the Greeks and Armenians (locals or hinterland refugees) in İzmir. These include the lynching of the Orthodox Metropolitan Chrysostomos following the recapture of the city on 9 September 1922 and the slaughter of Armenian and Greek males, who were then sent to the so-called labour battalions. The city was, once again, gradually rebuilt after the proclamation of the Turkish Republic in 1923.

In 2020, the city was damaged by the Aegean Sea earthquake and tsunami, which was the deadliest seismic event of that year. 117 people died and 1,034 more were injured in Turkey, all but one of whom were from the city of İzmir.

The city of İzmir is composed of several metropolitan districts. Of these, the district of Konak corresponds to historical İzmir, with this district&#x27;s area having constituted the city&#x27;s central &quot;İzmir Municipality&quot; () until 1984. With the formation of the &quot;İzmir Metropolitan Municipality&quot; (), the city of İzmir at first grouped together its eleven (initially nine) urban districts – namely Balçova, Bayraklı, Bornova, Buca, Çiğli, Gaziemir, Güzelbahçe, Karabağlar, Karşıyaka, Konak, and Narlıdere – and later consolidated them with an additional nine of the province&#x27;s districts outside the city proper. In 2013, the passing of Act 6360 established all thirty of İzmir Province&#x27;s districts as part of İzmir&#x27;s metropolitan area.

== Demographics ==
The period after the 1960s and the 1970s saw another blow to the fabric of İzmir, when local administrations tended to neglect İzmir&#x27;s traditional values and landmarks. For many inhabitants, this was as serious as the 1922 fire. Some administrators were not always in tune with the central government in Ankara and regularly fell short of government subsidies, and the city absorbed huge waves of immigration from inland Anatolia, causing a population explosion. Today, it is not surprising that many inhabitants of İzmir (similar to residents of other prominent Turkish cities) look back with nostalgia to a cozier, more manageable city, which came to an end in the last few decades.

The Floor Ownership Law of 1965 (&quot;Kat Mülkiyeti Kanunu&quot;), allowing and encouraging arrangements between house or land proprietors and building contractors by which each would share the benefits of renting out eight-floor apartment blocks built to replace former single-family houses, proved especially disastrous for the urban landscape.

Modern İzmir is growing in several directions at the same time. The north-western corridor extending to Aliağa brings together both mass housing projects, including villa-type projects and intensive industrial area, including an oil refinery. In the southern corridor towards Gaziemir yet another important growth trend is observed, contributed to by the Aegean Free Zone, light industry, the airport and mass housing projects. The presence of the Tahtalı Dam, built to provide drinking water, and its protected zone did not check urban spread here, which has offshoots in cooperatives outside the metropolitan area as far south as the Ayrancılar–Torbalı axis.

To the east and the north-east, urban development ends near the natural barriers constituted respectively by the Belkahve (Mount Nif) and Sabuncubeli (Mount Yamanlar-Mount Sipylus) passes. But the settlements both above Bornova, inside the metropolitan zone, and around Kemalpaşa and Ulucak, outside the metropolitan zone, see mass housing and secondary residences development.

More recently, the metropolitan area displays growth, especially along the western corridor, encouraged by the Çeşme motorway and extending to districts outside the city of İzmir proper, such as Seferihisar and Urla.
The population of the city is predominantly Muslim, but it was predominantly non-Muslim up to the earlier quarter of the 20th century.

İzmir is also home to Turkey&#x27;s second largest Jewish community after Istanbul, numbering about 2,500. The community is still concentrated in their traditional quarter of Karataş. Smyrniot Jews like Sabbatai Zevi and Darío Moreno were among famous figures in the city&#x27;s Jewish community. Others include the Pallache family with three grand rabbis: Haim, Abraham, and Nissim.

The Catholic Levantines of İzmir, who are mostly of Genoese and to a lesser degree of French and Venetian descent, live mainly in the districts of Bornova and Buca. One of the most prominent present-day figures of the community is Caroline Giraud Koç, wife of the renowned Turkish industrialist Mustafa Koç, whose company, Koç Holding, is one of the largest family-owned industrial conglomerates in the world.

İzmir once had a large Greek and Armenian community, but after the great fire of 1922 and the end of the Greco-Turkish War, many of the Greeks remaining in the city fled, were killed or forced to leave under the terms of the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey.

Turkey is home to tens of thousands of black citizens descended from the African slave trade in the Ottoman Empire that can be traced back to the 14th century. Known as Afro-Turks, İzmir and the surrounding areas on the Aegean coast is a central hub for this population.

== Climate ==
İzmir has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Cshk&quot;), which is characterized by prolonged, very hot, dry summers, and cool, rainy winters. İzmir&#x27;s average yearly precipitation is quite ample, at ; however, the vast majority of the city&#x27;s rainfall occurs from November through March, and there is usually very little rainfall from June to September, with frequent summer droughts. The city received its greatest daily rainfall, , on September 29, 2006, while the highest wind speed of was recorded on March 29, 1970.

Maximum temperatures during the winter months are mostly between . Although it is rare, snow can fall in İzmir from December to February, which usually stays for a few hours rather than a whole day or more. The record of snow depth was recorded on January 31, 1945. Frost does occasionally occur at night almost every winter. During summer, the air temperature can climb as high as from June to September; however, the high temperatures are usually between .

Etesian winds (Turkish: &quot;meltem&quot;, Greek: μελτέμι &quot;meltemi&quot;) of the Aegean Sea occur regularly in the Gulf and city of İzmir.

== Main sights ==

Standing on Mount Yamanlar, the tomb of Tantalus was excavated by Charles Texier in 1835 and is an example of the historic traces in the region prior to the Hellenistic Age, along with those found in nearby Kemalpaşa and Mount Sipylus.

The Agora of Smyrna is well preserved, and is arranged into the Agora Open Air Museum of İzmir, although important parts buried under modern buildings wait to be brought to light. Serious consideration is also being given to uncovering the ancient theatre of Smyrna where St. Polycarp was martyred, buried under an urban zone on the slopes of Kadifekale. It was distinguishable until the 19th century, as evident by the sketches done at the time. At top of the same hill stands an ancient castle, one of İzmir&#x27;s landmarks. Other ancient monument include also the Kızılçullu aqueducts in Buca district.

One of the more pronounced elements of İzmir&#x27;s harbor is the Clock Tower, a marble tower in the middle of the Konak district, standing in height. It was designed by Levantine French architect Raymond Charles Père in 1901 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the ascension of Abdülhamid II to the Ottoman throne in 1876. The tower features four fountains placed around the base in a circular pattern, and the columns are inspired by North African themes.

The Kemeraltı bazaar zone set up by the Ottomans, combined with the Agora, rests near the slopes of Kadifekale. İzmir has had three castles historically – Kadifekale (&quot;Pagos&quot;), the portuary Ok Kalesi (&quot;Neon Kastron, St. Peter&quot;), and Sancakkale, which remained vital to İzmir&#x27;s security for centuries. Sancakkale is situated in the present-day İnciraltı quarter between the Balçova and Narlıdere districts, on the southern shore of the Gulf of İzmir. It is at a key point where the strait allows entry into the innermost tip of the Gulf at its narrowest, and due to shallow waters through a large part of this strait, ships have sailed close to the castle.

There are nine synagogues in İzmir, concentrated either in the traditional Jewish quarter of Karatas or in Havra Sokak (&quot;Synagogue street&quot;) in Kemeraltı, and they all bear the signature of the 19th century when they were built or re-constructed in depth on the basis of former buildings.

The &quot;Atatürk Mask&quot; () is a large concrete relief of the head of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of modern Turkey, located to the south of Kadifekale the historical castle of İzmir.

The İzmir Bird Paradise (&quot;İzmir Kuş Cenneti&quot;) in Çiğli, a bird sanctuary near Karşıyaka, has 205 recorded species of birds, including 63 species that are resident year-round, 54 species of summer migratory birds, 43 species of winter migratory birds, and 30 transient species. 56 species of birds have bred in the park. The sanctuary, which covers 80 square kilometres, was registered as &quot;the protected area for water birds and for their breeding&quot; by the Turkish Ministry of Forestry in 1982. A large open-air zoo was established in the same district of Çiğli in 2008 under the name Sasalı Park of Natural Life.

== Culture ==
=== İzmir International Fair ===
İzmir prides itself with its busy schedule of trade fairs, exhibitions and congresses. The fair and the festival are held in the compound of İzmir&#x27;s vast inner city park named Kültürpark in the first days of September, and organized by İZFAŞ, a depending company of İzmir Metropolitan Municipality.

=== Festivals ===

The annual International İzmir Festival, which begins in mid-June and continues until mid-July, has been organized every year since 1987. During the festival, many world-class performers such as soloists and virtuosi, orchestras, dance companies, rock and jazz groups have given recitals and performances at various venues in the city and its surrounding areas; including the ancient theatres at Ephesus (near Selçuk) and Metropolis (an ancient Ionian city situated near the town of Torbalı.) The festival is a member of the European Festivals Association since 2003.

The İzmir European Jazz Festival is among the numerous events organized every year by the İKSEV (İzmir Foundation for Culture, Arts and Education) since 1994. The festival aims to bring together masters and lovers of jazz with the aim to generate feelings of love, friendship and peace.

The International İzmir Short Film Festival is organized since 1999 and is a member of the European Coordination of Film Festivals.

İzmir Metropolitan Municipality has built the Ahmet Adnan Saygun Art Center on a 21,000 m2 land plot in the Güzelyalı district, in order to contribute to the city&#x27;s culture and art life. The acoustics of the center have been prepared by ARUP which is a noted company in this field.

=== Music ===
In 2015 the Barış Youth Symphony Orchestra was founded, incorporating children with limited opportunities in low-income regions of the city, with the purpose to keep them away from crime on the street. The orchestra, grown up to nearly one hundred members, gives concerts accompanied by notable classic music artists.

=== Cuisine ===
İzmir&#x27;s cuisine has largely been affected by its multicultural history, hence the large variety of food originating from the Aegean and Mediterranean regions. Population movement from Eastern and South East Anatolia regions has enriched the local cuisine. Another factor is the large and fertile area of land surrounding the region which grows a rich selection of vegetables. There is considerable culinary usage of green leaf vegetables and wild plants amongst the residents, especially those with insular heritage, such as the immigrants from Crete. Some of the common dishes found here are the tarhana soup (made from dried yoghurt and tomatoes), &quot;İzmir&quot; köfte, sulu köfte, keşkek (boiled wheat with meat), zerde (sweetened rice with saffron) and &quot;mücver&quot; (made from zucchine and eggs). A Sephardic contribution to the Turkish cuisine, boyoz and lokma are pastries associated with İzmir. Kumru is a special kind of sandwich that is associated particularly with the Çeşme district and features cheese and tomato in its basics, with sucuk also added sometimes.

== Economy ==

The port of İzmir is Turkey&#x27;s main port for exports in terms of the freight handled and its free zone is the leader among the twenty in Turkey. The workforce, and particularly its rising class of young professionals, is concentrated either in the city or in its immediate vicinity (such as in Manisa and Turgutlu), and as either larger companies or SMEs, affirm their names with an increasingly wider global scale and intensity.

Trade through the city&#x27;s port had a determinant importance for the economy of the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th century and the economic foundations of the early decades of Turkey&#x27;s Republican era were also laid here during the İzmir Economic Congress.

At present, İzmir area&#x27;s economy is divided in value between various types of activities, as follows: 30.5% for industry, 22.9% for trade and related services, 13.5% for transportation and communication and 7.8% for agriculture. In 2008, İzmir provided 10.5% of all tax revenues collected by Turkey and its exports corresponded to 6% and its imports to 4% of Turkey&#x27;s foreign trade.

The province as a whole is Turkey&#x27;s third largest exporter after Istanbul and Bursa, and the fifth largest importer. 85–90% of the region&#x27;s exports and approximately one fifth of all Turkish exports are made through the Port of Alsancak with an annual container loading capacity of close to a million.

The 51,295 capacity (all-seater) İzmir Atatürk Stadium regularly hosts, apart from Turkish Super League games of İzmir-based teams, many other Super League and Turkish Cup derby matches.

The three big football clubs in İzmir are Altay (42 seasons in Süper Lig), Göztepe (30 seasons in Süper Lig), and Karşıyaka (16 seasons in Süper Lig). Other notable football clubs include: Bucaspor 1928, Altınordu, Menemen F.K., and İzmirspor. Bucaspor, now dissolved, were relegated from the top tier, Turkish Super League, at the end of the 2010–11 season.

Göztepe made sports history in Turkey by having played the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (which later became the UEFA Cup) in the 1968–69 season, and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in the 1969–70 season; becoming the first ever Turkish football club to play a semi-final game in Europe and the only one for two decades, until Galatasaray reached the semi-finals of the 1988–89 European Cup.

Göztepe and Altay have won the Turkish Cup twice for İzmir and all of İzmir&#x27;s teams have periodically jumped in and out of Süper Lig. Historically, İzmir is also the birthplace of two Greek sports clubs, namely the multi-sport club Panionios and association football club Apollon Smyrni F.C. which were founded in the city and moved to Athens after 1922.

Karşıyaka&#x27;s basketball department Karşıyaka Basket won the Turkish Basketball League twice (in the 1986–87 and 2014–15 seasons), the Turkish Cup once (in the 2013–14 season) and the Presidential Cup twice (in 1987 and 2014). The team plays its games at the Karşıyaka Arena. The 10,000 capacity (all-seater) Halkapınar Sports Hall is currently İzmir&#x27;s largest indoor sports arena and was among the venues of the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey.

Arkas Spor is a successful volleyball club in the city, having won the Turkish Men&#x27;s Volleyball League and the Turkish Cup several times, and the CEV Challenge Cup in the 2008–09 season. İzmir Atatürk Volleyball Hall regularly hosts the games of the city&#x27;s volleyball teams.

The city boasts of several sports legends, past and present. Already at the dawn of its history, notable natives such as the son of its first port&#x27;s founder Pelops had attained fame and kingdom with a chariot race and Onomastus is one of history&#x27;s first recorded sportspeople, having won the boxing contest in the Olympiad of 688 BC.

Born in İzmir, and nicknamed &quot;Taçsız Kral&quot; (The Uncrowned King), 1960s football star Metin Oktay is a legend in Turkey. Oktay became the first notable Turkish footballer to play abroad, with Palermo in Italy&#x27;s Serie A, during the 1961–1962 season. Two other notable football figures from İzmir are Alpay Özalan and Mustafa Denizli, the first having played for Aston Villa F.C. between 2000 and 2003 and the second, after a long playing career as the captain of İzmir&#x27;s Altay S.K., still pursues a successful career as a coach, being the only manager in Turkish Super League history to win a championship title with each of Istanbul&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; clubs (Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe S.K., and Beşiktaş J.K.) and having guided the Turkish national football team to the UEFA Euro 2000 Quarter-Finals.

== Politics ==
Politically, İzmir is considered a stronghold of Kemalism and the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP). The current mayor of the İzmir Metropolitan Municipality is Cemil Tugay from the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP), in office since 2024. His predecessor Tunç Soyer (CHP) was first elected in 2019 but was not nominated by the CHP for a second term.

İzmir has traditionally been a stronghold for the CHP, the centre-left Kemalist political party which forms the main opposition in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Being the third largest city in Turkey, İzmir is viewed as the CHP&#x27;s most prized electoral stronghold, since the party has a more limited support base in both Istanbul and Ankara. Since the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) gained power in 2002, the electorate of İzmir has been notable for voting strongly in favour of the CHP in every general and local election. In the 2007 and 2010 and 2017 referendums, the İzmir electorate strongly rejected the AKP government&#x27;s constitutional reform proposals. Almost all of the city&#x27;s districts have returned strong pluralities or majorities for the CHP in past elections, although the party lost ground in the 2014 local elections.

Due to the economic and historical importance of the city, İzmir has long been a strategic electoral target for the AKP, since beating the CHP in their most significant stronghold would be politically substantial. The majority of the citizens in İzmir have continued to vote for the centre-left political parties (in particular the CHP), despite large-scale pledges by the AKP promising investment and new infrastructure. For general elections, İzmir returns 28 members of parliament to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The province is split into two electoral districts which roughly divide the city into a northern and southern district, each electing 14 MPs. Anti-government protests in 2013 and 2014 against the AKP were particularly strong in İzmir.

During the 2023 presidential election, 63.31% of the city&#x27;s electorate voted for the CHP candidate Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu. In contrast, the AKP candidate Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received 31.48% of the vote.

During the 2024 local elections, despite the CHP&#x27;s candidate for metropolitan mayor Cemil Tugay winning by a smaller margin, the CHP won the mayoralties in 28 of the 30 districts of İzmir.

== Media ==
İzmir has its own local media companies: there are 9 TV channels headquartered in İzmir and broadcasting in the Aegean Region, 26 local radio stations and 15 local newspapers. TRT Belgesel (&quot;TRT Documentary&quot;) is a Turkish national TV channel broadcasting from the TRT building in İzmir.

There are 21 public hospitals in İzmir. The healthcare system in Turkey consists of a mix of public and private hospitals. Turkey also has a universal health care insurance system (SGK) which provides medical treatment free of charge in public hospitals to residents registered with a Turkish identity card number.

==Transport==

İzmir is served by domestic and international flights through the Adnan Menderes International Airport and by modern rapid transit systems serving the entirety of İzmir&#x27;s metropolitan area. The city has attracted investors through its strategic location and its relatively new and highly developed technological infrastructure in transportation, telecommunications, and energy.

=== Inter-city transport ===
==== Air ====
The Adnan Menderes International Airport (ADB) is well served with connections to Turkish and international destinations. It is located in the Gaziemir district of İzmir.

==== Bus ====
A large bus terminal, the &quot;Otogar&quot; in the Pınarbaşı neighborhood of the city, has intercity buses to destinations across Turkey. Bus companies&#x27; shuttle services pick up customers from each of their branch offices scattered across the city at regular intervals, often free of charge. To facilitate easier access, a Halkapınar—Otogar metro line has long been deliberated but construction has never begun – though throughout his campaign and upon his election as mayor of İzmir in 2019, Tunç Soyer has outlined it as one of his priorities.

==== Rail ====
İzmir has two historical rail terminals in the city centre. Alsancak Terminal, built in 1858, and Basmane Terminal, built in 1866, are the two main railway stations of the city. The Turkish State Railways operates regional service to Ödemiş, Tire, Selçuk, Aydın, Söke, Nazilli, Denizli and Uşak, as well as longer-distance intercity service to Ankara, Afyon and Bandırma (and from there to Istanbul via İDO connection).
=== Inner-city transport ===
Coordinated public transportation was introduced to İzmir in 1999. A body known as UKOME gives strategic direction to the Metro, the ESHOT bus division, ferry operations, utilities and road developments. İzmir has an electronic, integrated pre-pay ticket known as the &quot;İzmirim Kart&quot; (&#x27;My İzmir&#x27; Card). The card is valid on all metro and commuter rail lines, buses, ferries, trams, and in certain other municipal facilities. The İzmirim Kart allows for the use of multiple forms of transport within a 120-minute window, combining for a single fare price.

==== Bus ====
All of İzmir&#x27;s major districts are serviced by a dense, comprehensive municipal bus network under the name ESHOT. The acronym stands for &quot;E &quot;elektrik&quot; (electricity); S &quot;su&quot; (water); H &quot;havagazı&quot; (gas); O &quot;otobüs&quot; (bus) and T &quot;troleybüs&quot; (trolleybus).&quot; Electricity, water and gas are now supplied by separate undertakings, and İzmir&#x27;s trolleybus system ceased to operate in 1992. However, the bus operations, the O of the acronym ESHOT, has retained the original name. ESHOT operates 322 lines with about 1,500 buses and a staff of 2,700. It has five garages at Çakalburnu, Çiğli, Adatepe, Aktepe, and Mersinli. A privately owned company, İzulaş, operates 400 buses from two garages, running services under contract for ESHOT. These scheduled services are supplemented by the privately owned minibus or services.

==== Urban ferries ====

Taken over by İzmir Metropolitan Municipality since 2000 and operated within the structure of their private subsidiary company (İzdeniz), İzmir&#x27;s urban ferry services for passengers and vehicles are very much a part of the life of the city&#x27;s inhabitants. 24 ferries shuttle between 9 quays (clockwise: Bostanlı, Karşıyaka, Alsancak, Pasaport, Konak, Karantina, Göztepe and Üçkuyular.) Special lines to points further out in the gulf are also put in service during summer, transporting excursion or holiday makers. These services are cheap and it is not unusual to see natives or visitors taking a ferry ride simply as a pastime.

=== Metro ===

İzmir has a metro network that has been extended with new stations put in service. The İzmir Metro network, currently consisting of one main line, starts from the Kaymakamlık station in Narlıdere in the western portion of the metropolitan area and runs northeast through the city to Bornova. The line is long.

==== Regional rail ====

İZBAN, formerly known as Egeray, is a commuter rail system connecting metropolitan and suburban area of İzmir. It is the busiest commuter railway in Turkey, serving about 150,000 passengers daily. İZBAN is a portmanteau of the words &quot;&quot;İz&quot;mir&quot; and &quot;&quot;Ban&quot;liyö&quot;.

Established in 2006, İZBAN was formed to revive commuter rail in İzmir. İZBAN began operations in 2010 and currently operates a long system with 41 stations.

İZBAN A.Ş. operates the railway and is owned 50% by the Turkish State Railways and 50% by the İzmir Metropolitan Municipality.

==== Tram ====
İzmir&#x27;s latest tram system is owned by the metropolitan municipality and operated by İzmir Metro A.Ş. in three independent lines – one in Karşıyaka, opened in 2017, one in Konak, opened in 2018, and one in Çiğli, opened in 2024.

==== Public transportation statistics ====

<text>A practical effect is a special effect produced physically, without computer-generated imagery or other post-production techniques. In some contexts, &quot;special effect&quot; is used as a synonym of &quot;practical effect&quot;, in contrast to &quot;visual effects&quot; which are created in post-production through photographic manipulation or computer generation.

Many of the staples of action movies are practical effects. Gunfire, bullet wounds, rain, wind, fire, and explosions can all be produced on a movie set by someone skilled in practical effects. Non-human characters and creatures produced with make-up, prosthetics, masks, and in contrast to computer-generated are also examples of practical effects.

==Practical effect techniques==
* The use of prosthetic makeup, animatronics, puppetry, or creature suits to create the appearance of living creatures.
* Miniature effects, which is the use of scale models which are photographed in a way that they appear full sized.
* Mechanical effects, such as aerial rigging to simulate flight, stage mounted gimbals to make the ground move, or other mechanical devices to physically manipulate the environment.
* Pyrotechnics for the appearance of fire and explosions.
* Weather effects such as sprinkler systems to create rain, fog machines to create smoke, and fake snow.
* Squibs to create the illusion of gunshot wounds.

<text>The Wales national football team () represents Wales in international football. It is controlled by the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the governing body for football in Wales. They have been a member of FIFA since 1946 and a member of UEFA since 1954.

Wales have qualified for the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1958 and 2022. In 1958, they reached the quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions Brazil. They then went 58 years before reaching their second major tournament, when – following a rise of 109 places from an all-time low of 117th to a peak of 8th in the FIFA World Ranking between August 2011 and October 2015 – they qualified for UEFA Euro 2016, where they reached the semi-finals before again losing to the eventual champions, Portugal. A second successive UEFA European Championship followed when Wales reached the round of 16 of UEFA Euro 2020. They also progressed through UEFA Euro 1976 qualifying to the quarter-finals, though this was played on a two-legged, home-and-away basis and is not considered part of the finals tournament. 

Historically, the Welsh team has featured a number of players from Wales&#x27; top club teams, Cardiff City and Swansea City. These two Welsh clubs play in the English league system alongside fellow Welsh clubs Newport County, Wrexham and Merthyr Town. However, most Welsh football clubs play in the Welsh football league system. As a country of the United Kingdom, Wales is not a member of the International Olympic Committee (as Welsh athletes compete for Great Britain) and therefore the national team does not compete in the Olympic Games.

==History==
===The early years===

Wales played its first competitive match on 25 March 1876 against Scotland in Glasgow, making it the third-oldest international football team in the world. Although the Scots won the first fixture 4–0, a return match was planned in Wales the following year, and so it was that the first international football match on Welsh soil took place at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, on 5 March 1877. Scotland took the spoils winning 2–0. Wales&#x27; first match against England came in 1879, a 2–1 defeat at the Kennington Oval, London, and in 1882, Wales faced Ireland for the first time, winning 7–1 in Wrexham.

The associations of the four Home Nations met at the International Football Conference in Manchester on 6 December 1882 to set down a set of worldwide rules. This meeting saw the establishment of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) to approve changes to the rules, a task the four associations still perform to this day. The 1883–84 season saw the formation of the British Home Championship, a tournament which was played annually between England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales until 1983–84. Wales were champions on 12 occasions, winning outright seven times whilst sharing the title five times.

The FAW became members of FIFA, world football&#x27;s governing body, in 1910, but the relationship between FIFA and the British associations was fraught and the British nations withdrew from FIFA in 1928 in a dispute over payments to amateur players. As a result, Wales did not enter the first three FIFA World Cups. In 1932, Wales played host to the Republic of Ireland, the first time they played against a side from outside the four home nations. One year later, Wales played a match outside the United Kingdom for the first time when they travelled to Paris to play France national football team in a match drawn 1–1. After World War II, Wales, along with the other three home nations, rejoined FIFA in 1946 and took part in the qualifying rounds for the 1950 World Cup, the 1949–50 Home Championships being designated as a qualifying group. The top two teams were to qualify for the finals in Brazil, but Wales finished bottom of the group.

===1958 World Cup===

The 1950s were a golden age for Welsh football with stars such as Ivor Allchurch, Cliff Jones, Alf Sherwood, Jack Kelsey, Trevor Ford, Ronnie Burgess, Terry Medwin, Mel Charles and John Charles.

Wales made their first World Cup finals tournament appearance in the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden. However, their path to qualification was unusual. Having finished second to Czechoslovakia in qualifying Group 4, the golden generation of Welsh football managed by Jimmy Murphy seemed to have missed out on qualification, but the politics of the Middle East subsequently intervened. In the Asian/African qualifying zone, Egypt and Sudan had refused to play against Israel following the Suez crisis, while Indonesia had insisted on meeting Israel on neutral ground. As a result, FIFA proclaimed Israel winners of their group. However, FIFA did not want a team to qualify for the World Cup finals without actually playing a match, and so lots were drawn of all the second-placed teams in UEFA. Belgium were drawn out first but refused to participate, and so then Wales was drawn out and awarded a two-legged play-off match against Israel with a place in Sweden for the winners. Having defeated Israel 2–0 at the Ramat Gan Stadium and 2–0 at Ninian Park, Cardiff, Wales went through to a World Cup finals tournament for the first time.

The strong Welsh squad made their mark in Sweden, drawing all the matches in their group against Hungary, Mexico and Sweden before defeating Hungary in a play-off match to reach the quarter-finals against Brazil. However, Wales&#x27; chances of victory against Brazil were hampered by an injury to John Charles that ruled him out of the match. Wales lost 1–0 with 17-year-old Pelé scoring his first international goal. The goal made Pelé the youngest World Cup goal scorer and Brazil went on to win the tournament.

Wales&#x27; remarkable campaign in Sweden was the subject of the best-selling book &quot;When Pele Broke Our Hearts: Wales and the 1958 World Cup&quot; (by Mario Risoli, St David&#x27;s Press) which was published on the 40th anniversary of the World Cup and was also the inspiration for a Bafta Cymru-nominated documentary.

===1970s===
Wales failed to qualify for the first four finals tournaments of the UEFA European Championship from its inception in 1960. They also did not replicate their success in qualifying for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, although they did achieve a highly creditable draw against then world champions England in the 1970 British Home Championship, weeks before England went to defend their title in Mexico 1970 FIFA World Cup. This helped to give Wales a share of the Home Championship trophy for the year, goal difference not at that stage being used to determine an outright winner. In 1976, the team – managed by Mike Smith – reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA European Championship, having finished top of qualifying Group 2 ahead of Hungary, Austria and Luxembourg, but this was not considered part of the finals. Prior to 1980, only four countries qualified for the finals tournament, and Wales were drawn to play against the winners of Group 3 – Yugoslavia – in a two-legged, home-and-away tie. Wales lost the first leg 2–0 in Zagreb and were eliminated from the competition following a 1–1 draw in a bad-tempered return leg at Cardiff&#x27;s Ninian Park, which was marred by crowd trouble. This initially led to Wales being banned from the 1980 tournament, but this was reduced on appeal to a four-year ban on qualifying matches being played within 100 miles of Cardiff. Yugoslavia went on to finish fourth in the 1976 tournament.

The following year, Wales defeated England on English soil for the first time in 42 years and secured their only victory to date at Wembley Stadium thanks to a Leighton James penalty. Wales went onto finish second in the 1977 British Home Championship. A few weeks earlier, Wales achieved another noted victory against then European Champions Czechoslovakia with Nick Deacy and James again scoring. This victory in a qualifier strengthened Wales&#x27; bid to qualify for the 1978 FIFA World Cup, but six months later, that attempt ended in controversial circumstances. The decisive fixture against Scotland - nominally a home fixture for Wales, although relocated to Anfield amidst security concerns - was swung by a contentious penalty awarded to Scotland, replays suggesting the handball offence may have actually been perpetrated by Scottish striker Joe Jordan. Another notable achievement for Wales however came in the 1980 British Home Championship, as Wales comprehensively defeated England at the Racecourse Ground. Goals from Mickey Thomas, Ian Walsh, Leighton James and an own goal by Phil Thompson saw Wales defeat England 4–1 just four days after England had defeated the then-world champions, Argentina.

===1980s===
In the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the Wales team – managed by Mike England – came extremely close to qualification; a 3–0 defeat against the Soviet Union in their final match meant they missed out on goal difference, but the real damage had been done by their failure to beat Iceland in their last home match, the match eventually finishing 2–2 after several hold-ups due to floodlight failures.

Wales also only narrowly missed out on qualification for the 1984 UEFA European Championship. They were seconds away from qualification when a winning goal by Ljubomir Radanović for Yugoslavia during injury time in the final game of qualifying group 4 against Bulgaria eliminated Wales.

Mark Hughes marked his debut for Wales by scoring the only goal of the match as England were defeated once again in 1984. The following season, Hughes was again on target, scoring a wonder goal as Wales thrashed Spain 3–0 at the Racecourse during qualification for the 1986 World Cup. However, despite defeating Scotland 1–0 at Hampden Park, it was again Iceland that wrecked Welsh hopes by defeating Wales 1–0 in Reykjavík, and for the second World Cup in a row, Wales missed out on goal difference. Wales had to win their last match at home to Scotland to be guaranteed at least a play-off, but were held to a 1–1 draw in a match marred by the death of Scotland manager Jock Stein, who collapsed from a heart attack at the end of the match.

Wales also started strongly in their bid to qualify for the 1988 UEFA European Championship, and were undefeated after four games. But away defeats against Denmark and Czechoslovakia in the last two games in qualifying group 6 saw Mike England&#x27;s eight-year reign as Welsh coach end in another disappointment.

===1990s===
Under coach Terry Yorath, Wales achieved a remarkable result on 5 June 1991 when defeating then world champions Germany in a Euro 1992 qualifier, thanks to a goal from Ian Rush. Three months later, on 11 September 1991, Wales achieved a notable double by defeating Brazil for the only time in a friendly international, thanks to a goal from Dean Saunders. At this point, Wales seemed well placed to progress from their qualifying group 5. However, victories for Germany in their three remaining matches in the group, including a 4–1 win in the return fixture against Wales, eliminated the Welsh.

Wales also made a strong showing in their qualifying group for the 1994 World Cup, achieving a noted victory at home to Belgium. Wales thus attained what was then their highest position in the FIFA World Rankings on 27 August 1993. Wales again came close to qualifying for a major championship only to fall short in the closing stages of their campaign. Needing to win the final match of the group at home to Romania on 17 November, Paul Bodin missed a penalty when the scores were level 1–1; the miss was immediately followed by Romania taking the lead and going on to win 2–1.

Following the failure to qualify, Yorath&#x27;s contract as manager of the national side was not renewed by the FAW, and Real Sociedad manager John Toshack was appointed on a part-time basis. However, Toshack resigned after just one match (a 3–1 defeat to Norway) citing problems with the FAW as his reason for leaving, although he was sure to have been shocked at being booed off the pitch at Ninian Park by the Welsh fans still reeling from the dismissal of Yorath. Mike Smith took the manager role for the second time at the start of the Euro 1996 qualifiers, but Wales slipped to embarrassing defeats against Moldova and Georgia before Bobby Gould was appointed in June 1995.

Gould&#x27;s time in charge of Wales is seen as a dark period by Welsh football fans. His questionable tactics and public fallings-out with players Nathan Blake, Robbie Savage and Mark Hughes, coupled with embarrassing defeats to club side Leyton Orient and a 7–1 thrashing by the Netherlands in 1996 did not make him a popular figure within Wales. Gould finally resigned following a 4–0 defeat to Italy in 1999, and the FAW turned to two legends of the national team, Neville Southall and Mark Hughes, to take temporary charge of the match against Denmark four days later, with Hughes later being appointed on a permanent basis.

===2000s===
Under Mark Hughes, Wales came close to qualifying for a place at Euro 2004 in Portugal, being narrowly defeated by Russia in the play-offs. However, the defeat was not without its controversy, as Russian midfielder Yegor Titov tested positive for the use of a banned substance after the first qualifying leg, a scoreless draw in Moscow. Notwithstanding, FIFA opted not to take action against the Football Union of Russia other than instructing them not to field Titov again, and the Russian team went on to defeat Wales 1–0 in Cardiff to qualify for the final tournament.

Following a disappointing start to the 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign, Hughes left his role with the national team to take over as manager of Premier League outfit Blackburn Rovers. John Toshack was appointed manager for the second time in November 2004. In Euro 2008 qualifying, Wales finished 5th in Group D. In 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 4, two 2–0 home defeats by Finland and Germany in spring 2009 effectively ended Wales&#x27; hopes of qualification.

Wales were drawn in UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G. After a defeat at Montenegro in their opening match, on 9 September 2010, John Toshack stood down as manager after being disappointed at previous results in 2010 against Croatia and the opening Euro 2012 qualifier. Wales under-21 coach Brian Flynn took over from Toshack as caretaker manager.

===2010s===

Gary Speed was appointed as permanent manager on 14 December 2010. Speed appointed 20-year-old Aaron Ramsey captain, making him the youngest Wales captain. In August 2011, Wales attained their lowest FIFA ranking of 117th. After some promising performances, in October 2011, Wales had rapidly risen to 45th in the FIFA rankings. A 4–1 home win in a friendly match against Norway on 12 November 2011 proved to be Speed&#x27;s last match in charge of Wales. The match was a culmination of Speed&#x27;s efforts which led Wales to receive the unofficial award for biggest mover of 2011 in the FIFA rankings. His tenure as manager ended in tragic circumstances two weeks later when he was found dead at his home on 27 November, having apparently committed suicide.

Due to London&#x27;s successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, a Great Britain team would qualify as of right of being the host nation. However, the FAW stressed it was strongly against the proposal. Despite this, Welsh players Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale expressed their interest in representing the Great Britain Olympic football team. Bale withdrew due to injury, but Ramsey was joined by four other Welshmen in Stuart Pearce&#x27;s 18-man squad: Swansea City&#x27;s Joe Allen and Neil Taylor, while Manchester United&#x27;s Ryan Giggs and Liverpool&#x27;s Craig Bellamy were included as over-age players, with Giggs being made captain.

Chris Coleman was appointed Wales team manager on 19 January 2012. For 2014 World Cup qualification, Wales were drawn in Group A but finished 5th. Wales were placed in Group B for qualifying for Euro 2016. In July 2015, following four wins and two draws, Wales topped the group.

In July 2015, having attained their then highest FIFA ranking of tenth, Wales were placed among the top seeds for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification draw. In September 2015, England dropped to tenth in the FIFA rankings, making Wales – in ninth position – the highest-ranked British team for the first time in its history. In October 2015, Wales attained their highest ever FIFA ranking of eighth. On 10 October 2015, Wales lost 2–0 to Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, Wales&#x27; qualification for Euro 2016 was confirmed after Cyprus defeated Israel that same evening.

====Euro 2016====

Wales qualified for Euro 2016 in France, their first European Championship tournament, and were drawn into Group B with Slovakia, Russia and England. On their Euro debut, on 11 June against Slovakia at the Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux, Gareth Bale scored direct from a free-kick to give Wales a 1–0 lead, and Hal Robson-Kanu scored the winner in a 2–1 victory. In their second match, against England in Lens, Wales led 1–0 at half-time through another Bale free-kick, but lost 2–1. Against Russia at the Stadium Municipal in Toulouse, Aaron Ramsey, Neil Taylor and Bale scored in a 3–0 win that made them win the group.

In their round of 16 match at the Parc des Princes in Paris, Wales played Northern Ireland and won 1–0 after an own goal from Gareth McAuley. In the quarter-final against Belgium, Wales went behind to a long-range effort from Radja Nainggolan, but captain Ashley Williams headed an equaliser before Hal Robson-Kanu and Sam Vokes confirmed a 3–1 victory for Wales. This victory advanced Wales to their first major tournament semi-final and also made them the first British nation to advance to the semi-finals of a major tournament since 1996.

Wales lost 2–0 in the semi-final against Portugal with goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani early in the second half. Wales were welcomed back home on 8 July with an open-top bus parade around Cardiff, starting at Cardiff Castle and going past the Millennium Stadium before finishing at the Cardiff City Stadium.

====2018 World Cup qualification and China Cup====
Wales finished third in their 2018 World Cup qualifying group, therefore failing to qualify for the final tournament. Chris Coleman resigned as Wales manager on 17 November 2017 to join Sunderland.

Wales were invited to participate in the 2018 China Cup alongside China, Czech Republic and Uruguay. Wales beat China 6–0 in the semi-final but lost 1–0 in the final to Uruguay.

===2020s===
On 15 January 2018, Ryan Giggs was confirmed as new manager. Despite losing two of the first three qualifiers for UEFA Euro 2020, Wales went unbeaten in the second half of 2019 and ultimately qualified in second place following a 2–0 win over Hungary in their final match on 19 November. Euro 2020 was delayed until 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, which meant Wales&#x27; next games came in the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League. They kept five consecutive clean sheets on the way to an unbeaten record in the competition, winning five games and drawing one, despite Giggs not being available for the last two games due to legal troubles. With Rob Page in interim charge, the team beat Finland 3–1 in their final match to finish top of the group and gain promotion to League A for the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League.

UEFA Euro 2020 was played in June and July 2021. Under Page as interim manager, Wales progressed from the group stage after finishing second in the group on goal difference. In the last 16 round Wales lost to Denmark in Amsterdam.

Rob Page remained in interim charge for the 2022 World Cup qualification campaign. Wales finished second in Group E and progressed to the qualification play-off stage. After beating Austria in the play-off semi-final, Wales qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1958 with a 1–0 win over Ukraine.

Following their promotion in the previous Nations League campaign, Wales were drawn in Group A4 of the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League along with Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland, with Rob Page still interim manager.

On 20 June 2022, Ryan Giggs resigned as Wales manager due to his upcoming court case. Page stayed on as interim manager before being given a four-year contract extension in September 2022, managing Wales at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. After a 1–1 draw with the United States in the opening match, Wales lost their second match to Iran after conceding two injury time goals. In their final match, Wales were eliminated after losing 3–0 to England, therefore, finishing bottom of the group. 

On 9 January 2023, Wales captain Gareth Bale retired from club and international football. At the time of his retirement he was the record goal scorer and record appearance holder for Wales.

During UEFA Euro 2024 qualification, Wales finished 3rd in their group, meaning they would need to qualify via the play-offs. In the play-off semi-final, Wales beat Finland 4–1 but lost the play-off final to Poland on penalties. In June 2024, Rob Page was sacked as Wales&#x27; manager.

Craig Bellamy was announced as the head coach of the Welsh national team on 9 July 2024.

===Colours and logo===
The primary kit has long been all-red. The crest of the Football Association of Wales features a rampant Welsh Dragon on a white shield. From 1920, the shield was surrounded by a red border, and the letters &#x27;FAW&#x27; were added in 1926. The badge was redesigned in 1951, adding a green border with 11 daffodils, as well as the Welsh-language motto &quot;Gorau Chwarae Cyd Chwarae&quot; (&quot;The best play is team play&quot;). The motto was briefly removed in 1984, but the badge stayed largely the same until 2010, when the shield was changed to feature rounded sides and the motto banner was changed from white to red and green. The dragon also changed from rampant to rampant regardant. The motto was removed again in 2019, following another major redesign of the badge, which saw the top of the shield flattened and the sides changed not to curve outwards; the green border was also thinned and the daffodils removed.

===Name===
The team is sometimes known and branded mononymously as &quot;Cymru&quot;, the Welsh language name for Wales, by the Football Association of Wales (FAW; or in ; CBC), as the FAW uses the term in its internal and external communications. In October 2022, the FAW announced it was considering rebranding the team to only use the Welsh name for the country, ditching the term &quot;Wales&quot;, following the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The association said it was in discussions with UEFA over how to change the name, and were inspired by Turkey&#x27;s rebrand to and not being the last country alphabetically in some football events. The suggestion was stated by University of Limerick professor Owen Worth, to be an example of the connection between the team&#x27;s supporters&#x27; clubs and pro-Welsh independence groups such as YesCymru and AUOB Cymru.

==Home stadium==
From 2000 to 2009, Wales played most of their home matches at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. The stadium was built in 1999 on the site of the old National Stadium, known as Cardiff Arms Park, as the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) had been chosen to host the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Prior to 1989, Wales played their home games at the grounds of Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham, but then came to an agreement with the WRU to use Cardiff Arms Park and, subsequently, the Millennium Stadium.

Wales&#x27; first football match at the Millennium Stadium was against Finland on 29 March 2000. The Finns won the match 2–1, with Jari Litmanen becoming the first player to score a goal at the stadium. Ryan Giggs scored Wales&#x27; goal in the match, becoming the first Welshman to score at the stadium.

With the opening of the Cardiff City Stadium in 2009, the FAW chose to stage most home friendlies there, with other friendly matches played at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea (now known as the Swansea.com Stadium) and the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. Qualifying matches continued to be played at the 74,500-capacity Millennium Stadium until the end of 2009, which was typically only around 20–40% full amid poor team results. This led to calls from fans and players for international matches to be held at smaller stadiums. For the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, the FAW decided Wales would play all of their home matches at either the Cardiff City Stadium or the Liberty Stadium, with the exception of the home tie against England, which was played at the Millennium Stadium. The 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign saw four home matches at the Cardiff City Stadium and one at the Liberty Stadium. Cardiff City Stadium&#x27;s capacity was increased to 33,000 in 2014 and all home matches for Euro 2016 qualifying were scheduled at the stadium and Wales subsequently qualified for the finals tournament in France. All five home qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup were held at the stadium as well as both of the team&#x27;s home 2018–19 UEFA Nations League games. All home games in the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign also took place there. A friendly against Spain was played at the Millennium Stadium on 11 October 2018, which was Wales&#x27; first match at the stadium in just over seven-and-a-half years, finishing in a 4–1 defeat. On 20 March 2019, Wales played a friendly against Trinidad and Tobago at the Racecourse Ground, their first match there since 2008.

<doc id="580295" wikidata="Q7627643" url="?curid=580295" title="Liberation Left">
<text>Liberation Left (formerly Student Broad Left or SBL) is a factional grouping operating within the National Union of Students of the United Kingdom.

The group was formed in 1997 as a split from the Campaign for Free Education (CFE) and first contested NUS elections in 1998. It is characterised by its vocal support for the NUS Liberation Campaigns, Palestinian rights and for free-to-student, state-funded education, and its determined opposition to racism, Islamophobia, fascism, and war. The group describes itself as a &quot;network of left activists campaigning for a progressive student movement&quot;, and has Labour, Green, and independent members. Today, the group has members in Labour parliamentary candidacies and its National Executive Committee.

The group should not be confused with the principally CPGB, Labour, and Liberal grouping known as Broad Left, which held the NUS presidency between 1973 and 1984.

==Background==

In most years, Student Broad Left formed a slate with the Campaign for Free Education and Socialist Workers&#x27; Student Society, to increase the number of socialist candidates elected. This assisted the group in ensuring it has almost always had a least one member elected to the NUS Executive. In the 2004 NUS elections the CFE and SWSS split and stood against each other. Student Broad Left and the CFE negotiated a slate for some places, but in the proportional representation &quot;Block of 12&quot; election, Student Broad Left supported transfers to SWSS over CFE . Student Broad Left candidate Peter Leary polled 2nd in the Block of 12 in 2004 and 2005 coming behind only Labour Students. George Woods was Student Broad Left&#x27;s Block of 12 member for 2006-8.

Opponents of Student Broad Left claim that many of the founders of the group, including all SBL candidates to the NUS National Executive Committee, have been closely linked to Socialist Action , pointing out that the Student Broad Left supports the same campaigns as Socialist Action, for example the Student Assembly Against Racism, Unite Against Fascism, Student CND, and Cuban solidarity. Though these allegations are levelled at SBL members with some regularity, the list of organisations could cover many left wing groups and individuals, and is not indicative of any particular faction.

In 2008, Student Broad Left had mixed fortunes. During the 2008 NUS Annual Conference, Student Broad Left formed a slate with Student Respect putting forward Ruqayyah Collector, NUS Black Students&#x27; Officer 2006-8, as candidate for NUS National President. Bryony Shanks was put forward as candidate for NUS National Treasurer and the Block of 12. Neither Ruqayyah or Bryony were elected.

Student Broad Left has become much more active in 2010, and co-hosted the Progressive Students Conference with the National Black Students&#x27; Alliance in October 2010, attracting high-profile speakers including Ken Livingstone, Salma Yaqoob, Adrian Ramsay, Emily Thornberry, and more from organisations including CND, Unite Against Fascism, UCU, and the NUS.

Kanja Sesay, NUS Black Students&#x27; Officer, and Joshi Sachdeo were Student Broad Left members of the NUS Executive for 2010–11.

NUS National Conference 2011 saw the election of Student Broad Left&#x27;s Aaron Kiely to the Block of 15. Kiely joined Sesay and Sachdeo on the NUS Executive for 2011–12.

NUS conference 2012 saw Student Broad Left&#x27;s Kanja Sesay run for president against incumbent Liam Burns, VP HE Usman Ali and VP UD Ed Marsh. Sesay gained 120 votes in the first round. A joint Student Broad Left and Young Greens candidate, Matt Stanley, was elected to the Block of 15, and Aaron Kiely was elected as Black Students&#x27; Officer.

==Rebrand==
In 2016, following the successful election of controversial SBL-backed candidate Malia Bouattia, SBL restructured under the brand of &#x27;Liberation Left&#x27;. Prominent figures continued vocal support for the NUS Liberation Campaigns, Palestinian rights and opposition to Islamophobia.

Several Liberation Left figures have since been accused of antisemitism. NEC members
Ayo Olatunji and Ali Milani have both been embroiled in rows around antisemitic Twitter comments, with Milani having tweeted &quot;Israel has no right to exist&quot;. Former President Bouattia was condemned by 300 Jewish student leaders, the Union of Jewish Students and the Home Affairs Select Committee. Bouattia&#x27;s comments, described as &quot;outright racism&quot; by the Committee, triggered fifteen disaffiliation campaigns at member unions.

==2019 victories==
At the 2019 national conference, there was another breakdown in left-wing factional support, with the CFE-descendant Student Left Network actively fielding candidates against LibLeft incumbents and campaigning for two left-wing candidates. However, moderate factions were in decline; the OIs had been focused on Brexit and NUS reform, and Labour Students had faced ten disaffiliations after a democracy scandal. Liberation Left were successful in three of the four national elections, including electing Zamzam Ibrahim as National President.

<text>The Sultanate of Rum was a culturally Turco-Persian Sunni Muslim state, established over conquered Byzantine territories and peoples (Rum) of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks following their entry into Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The name &quot;Rum&quot; was a synonym for the medieval Eastern Roman Empire and its peoples, as it remains in modern Turkish. The name is derived from the Aramaic () and Parthian () names for ancient Rome, via the Greek ().

The Sultanate of Rum seceded from the Seljuk Empire under Suleiman ibn Qutalmish in 1077. It had its capital first at Nicaea and then at Iconium. It reached the height of its power during the late 12th and early 13th century, when it succeeded in taking key Byzantine ports on the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. In the east, the sultanate reached Lake Van. Trade through Anatolia from Iran and Central Asia was developed by a system of caravanserai. Especially strong trade ties with the Genoese formed during this period. The increased wealth allowed the sultanate to absorb other Turkish states that had been established following the conquest of Byzantine Anatolia: Danishmendids, House of Mengüjek, Saltukids, Artuqids.

The Seljuk sultans bore the brunt of the Crusades and eventually succumbed to the Mongol invasion at the 1243 Battle of Köse Dağ. For the remainder of the 13th century, the Seljuks acted as vassals of the Ilkhanate. Their power disintegrated during the second half of the 13th century. The last of the Seljuk vassal sultans of the Ilkhanate, Mesud II, was murdered in 1308. The dissolution of the Seljuk state left behind many small Anatolian beyliks (Turkish principalities), among them that of the Ottoman dynasty, which eventually conquered the rest and reunited Anatolia to become the Ottoman Empire.

== Etymology ==
A few historians from Europe, looking at the Turkish fighting force they encountered in Anatolia during the First Crusade and the Turkmen groups they encountered, saw that Anatolia was now Turkish land and began to call these lands &quot;Turkey&quot;.On the other hand, the term used by the entire Islamic world for Anatolia during this period was &quot;Diyar-ı Rum&quot;(Land of Roma) Therefore, the country was also called the Sultanate of Rum.

==History==
===Establishment===
Since the 1030s, migratory Turkish groups in search of pastureland had penetrated Byzantine borders into Anatolia. In the 1070s, after the battle of Manzikert, the Seljuk commander Suleiman ibn Qutulmish, a distant cousin of Alp Arslan and a former contender for the throne of the Seljuk Empire, came to power in western Anatolia. Between 1075 and 1081, he gained control of the Byzantine cities of Nicaea (present-day İznik) and briefly also Nicomedia (present-day İzmit). Around two years later, he established a principality that, while initially a Byzantine vassal state, became increasingly independent after six to ten years. Nevertheless, it seems that Suleiman was tasked by Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1085 to reconquer Antioch and the former travelled there on a secret route, presumably guided by the Byzantines.

Suleiman tried, unsuccessfully, to conquer Aleppo in 1086, and died in the Battle of Ain Salm, either fighting his enemies or by suicide. In the aftermath, Suleiman&#x27;s son Kilij Arslan I was imprisoned and a general of his, Abu&#x27;l-Qasim, took power in Nicaea. Following the death of sultan Malik Shah in 1092, Kilij Arslan was released and established himself in his father&#x27;s territories between 1092 and 1094, possibly with the approval of Malik Shah&#x27;s son and successor Berkyaruq.

===Crusades===
Kilij Arslan, although victorious against the People&#x27;s Crusade of 1096, was defeated by soldiers of the First Crusade and driven back into south-central Anatolia, where he set up his state with its capital in Konya. He defeated three Crusade contingents in the Crusade of 1101. In 1107, he ventured east and captured Mosul but died the same year fighting Malik Shah&#x27;s son, Mehmed Tapar. He was the first Muslim commander against the crusades.

Meanwhile, another Rum Seljuk, Malik Shah (not to be confused with the Seljuk sultan of the same name), captured Konya. In 1116 Kilij Arslan&#x27;s son, Mesud I, took the city with the help of the Danishmends. Upon Mesud&#x27;s death in 1156, the sultanate controlled nearly all of central Anatolia. 

The Second Crusade was announced by Pope Eugene III, and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia, both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuk Turks. The main Western Christian source, Odo of Deuil, and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos secretly hindered the crusaders&#x27; progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. However, this alleged sabotage of the Crusade by the Byzantines was likely fabricated by Odo, who saw the Empire as an obstacle, and moreover Emperor Manuel had no political reason to do so. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on Damascus, which ended in their retreat. In the end, the crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a victory for the Muslims. It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century.

Mesud&#x27;s son, Kilij Arslan II, is the first known Seljuk ruler who is known to have used the title of sultan and captured the remaining territories around Sivas and Malatya from the last of the Danishmends. At the Battle of Myriokephalon in 1176, Kilij Arslan II also defeated a Byzantine army led by Manuel I Komnenos. Despite a temporary occupation of Konya in 1190 by the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s forces of the Third Crusade, the sultanate was quick to recover and consolidate its power. During the last years of Kilij Arslan II&#x27;s reign, the sultanate experienced a civil war with Kaykhusraw I fighting to retain control and losing to his brother Suleiman II in 1196.

Following Kilij Arslan II&#x27;s death, the sultanate was divided amongst his sons. Elbistan was given to Tughril ibn Kılıç Arslan II, but when Erzurum was taken from the Saltukids at the start of the thirteenth century, he was installed there. Tughril governed Erzurum from 1192 to 1221. During 1211–1212, he broke free from the Seljuk state. In 1230, Jahan Shah bin Tughril who was allied to the Khwarazmshah Jalal al-Din, lost the Battle of Yassıçemen, allowing for Erzurum to be annexed by the Seljuk sultanate.

Suleiman II rallied his vassal emirs and marched against Georgia, with an army of 150,000–400,000 and encamped in the Basiani valley. Tamar of Georgia quickly marshaled an army throughout her possessions and put it under command of her consort, David Soslan. Georgian troops under David Soslan made a sudden advance into Basiani and assailed the enemy&#x27;s camp in 1203 or 1204. In a pitched battle, the Seljukid forces managed to roll back several attacks of the Georgians but were eventually overwhelmed and defeated. Loss of the sultan&#x27;s banner to the Georgians resulted in a panic within the Seljuk ranks. Süleymanshah himself was wounded and withdrew to Erzurum. Both the Rum Seljuk and Georgian armies suffered heavy casualties, but coordinated flanking attacks won the battle for the Georgians.

Suleiman II died in 1204 and was succeeded by his son Kilij Arslan III, whose reign was unpopular. Kaykhusraw I seized Konya in 1205 reestablishing his reign. Under his rule and those of his two successors, Kaykaus I and Kayqubad I, Seljuk power in Anatolia reached its apogee. Kaykhusraw&#x27;s most important achievement was the capture of the harbour of Attalia (Antalya) on the Mediterranean coast in 1207. His son Kaykaus captured Sinop and made the Empire of Trebizond his vassal in 1214. He also subjugated Cilician Armenia but in 1218 was forced to surrender the city of Aleppo, acquired from al-Kamil. Kayqubad continued to acquire lands along the Mediterranean coast from 1221 to 1225.

In the 1220s, he sent an expeditionary force across the Black Sea to Crimea. In the east he defeated the Mengujekids and began to put pressure on the Artuqids.

===Mongol conquest===

Kaykhusraw II (1237–1246) began his reign by capturing the region around Diyarbakır, but in 1239 he had to face an uprising led by a popular preacher named Baba Ishak. After three years, when he had finally quelled the revolt, the Crimean foothold was lost and the state and the sultanate&#x27;s army had weakened. It is in these conditions that he had to face a far more dangerous threat, that of the expanding Mongols. The forces of the Mongol Empire took Erzurum in 1242 and in 1243, the sultan was crushed by Baiju in the Battle of Köse Dağ (a mountain between the cities of Sivas and Erzincan), resulting in the Seljuk Turks being forced to swear allegiance to the Mongols and became their vassals. The sultan himself had fled to Antalya after the battle, where he died in 1246; his death started a period of tripartite, and then dual, rule that lasted until 1260.

The Seljuk realm was divided among Kaykhusraw&#x27;s three sons. The eldest, Kaykaus II (1246–1260), assumed the rule in the area west of the river Kızılırmak. His younger brothers, Kilij Arslan IV (1248–1265) and Kayqubad II (1249–1257), were set to rule the regions east of the river under Mongol administration. In October 1256, Bayju defeated Kaykaus II near Aksaray and all of Anatolia became officially subject to Möngke Khan. In 1260 Kaykaus II fled from Konya to Crimea where he died in 1279. Kilij Arslan IV was executed in 1265, and Kaykhusraw III (1265–1284) became the nominal ruler of all of Anatolia, with the tangible power exercised either by the Mongols or the sultan&#x27;s influential regents.
The Seljuk state had started to split into small emirates (beyliks) that increasingly distanced themselves from both Mongol and Seljuk control. In 1277, responding to a call from Anatolia, the Mamluk Sultan Baibars raided Anatolia and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of Elbistan, temporarily replacing them as the administrator of the Seljuk realm. But since the native forces who had called him to Anatolia did not manifest themselves for the defense of the land, he had to return to his home base in Egypt, and the Mongol administration was re-assumed, officially and severely. Also, the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia captured the Mediterranean coast from Selinos to Seleucia, as well as the cities of Marash and Behisni, from the Seljuk in the 1240s.

Near the end of his reign, Kaykhusraw III could claim direct sovereignty only over lands around Konya. Some of the beyliks (including the early Ottoman state) and Seljuk governors of Anatolia continued to recognize, albeit nominally, the supremacy of the sultan in Konya, delivering the khutbah in the name of the sultans in Konya in recognition of their sovereignty, and the sultans continued to call themselves Fahreddin, &quot;the Pride of Islam&quot;. When Kaykhusraw III was executed in 1284, the Seljuk dynasty suffered another blow from internal struggles which lasted until 1303 when the son of Kaykaus II, Mesud II, established himself as sultan in Kayseri. He was murdered in 1308 and his son Mesud III soon afterwards. A distant relative to the Seljuk dynasty momentarily installed himself as emir of Konya, but he was defeated and his lands conquered by the Karamanids in 1328. The sultanate&#x27;s monetary sphere of influence lasted slightly longer and coins of Seljuk mint, generally considered to be of reliable value, continued to be used throughout the 14th century, once again, including by the Ottomans.
==Culture and society==

The Seljuk dynasty of Rum, as successors to the Great Seljuks, based its political, religious and cultural heritage on the Turco-Persian tradition and Greco-Roman world, even to the point of naming their sons with New Persian names. The Seljuks of Rum had inherited the administrative method of Persian statecraft from the Seljuk Empire, which they would later pass on to the Ottomans.

As an expression of Turco-Persian culture, Rum Seljuks patronized Persian art, architecture, and literature. Unlike the Seljuk Empire, the Seljuk sultans of Rum had Persian names such as Kay Khosrow, Kay Kawad/Qobad, and Kay Kāvus. The bureaucrats and religious elite of their realm were generally Persian. In the 13th century, most Muslim inhabitants in major Anatolian urban hubs reportedly spoke Persian as their main language. It was in this century that the proneness of imitating Iran in terms of administration, religion and culture reached its zenith, encouraged by the major influx of Persian refugees fleeing Mongol invasions, who brought Persian culture with them and were instrumental in creating a &quot;second Iran&quot; in Anatolia. Iranian cultural, political, and literary traditions deeply influenced Anatolia in the early 13th century. The notable historian Ibn Bibi composed a six-volume Persian language poetic work called the Selçukname, modeled after the Shahnamah, which focused on the Seljuk sultans.

Despite their Turkic origins, the Seljuks used Persian for administrative purposes; even their histories, which replaced Arabic, were in Persian. Their usage of Turkish was hardly promoted at all. Even Sultan Kilij Arslan II, as a child, spoke to courtiers in Persian. Khanbaghi states the Anatolian Seljuks were even more Persianized than the Seljuks that ruled the Iranian plateau. Persian poetry was written by sultans Suleiman II, Kayqubad I, and Kaykhusraw II.

The &quot;Rahat al-sudur&quot;, the history of the Great Seljuk Empire and its breakup, written in Persian by Muhammad bin Ali Rawandi, was dedicated to Sultan Kaykhusraw I. Even the &quot;Tārikh-i Āl-i Saldjūq&quot;, an anonymous history of the Sultanate of Rum, was written in Persian. The sultans of Rum were largely not educated in Arabic. This clearly limited the Arab influence, or at least the direct influence, to a relatively small degree. In contrast, Persian literature and Iranian influence expanded because most sultans and even a significant portion of the townspeople knew the language.
One of its most famous Persian writers, Rumi, took his name from the name of the state. Moreover, Byzantine influence in the Sultanate was also significant, since Byzantine Greek aristocracy remained part of the Seljuk nobility, and the native Byzantine (Rûm) peasants remained numerous in the region. Based on their genealogy, it appears that the Seljuk sultans favored Christian slave-concubines, just like the early Ottoman sultans. Within the Seljuk harem, Greek women were the most dominant. Cultural Turkification in Anatolia first started during the 14th-century, particularly during the gradual rise of the Ottomans. With a population that included Byzantine Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, Turks, and Persians, the Seljuks were very successful between 1220 and 1250 and set the groundwork for later Islamization of Anatolia.

== Architecture ==
In their construction of caravanserais, madrasas and mosques, the Rum Seljuks translated the Iranian Seljuk architecture of bricks and plaster into the use of stone. Among these, the &quot;caravanserais&quot; (or &quot;hans&quot;), used as stops, trading posts and defense for caravans, and of which about a hundred structures were built during the Anatolian Seljuk period, are particularly remarkable. Along with Persian influences, which had an indisputable effect, Seljuk architecture was inspired by local Byzantine architects, for example in the Celestial Mosque in Sivas, and by Armenian architecture. Anatolian architecture represents some of the most distinctive and impressive constructions in the entire history of Islamic architecture. Later, this Anatolian architecture would be inherited by the Sultanate of India.

The largest caravanserai is the Sultan Han (built-in 1229) on the road between the cities of Konya and Aksaray, in the township of Sultanhanı, covering . Two caravanserais carry the name &quot;Sultan Han&quot;, the other one being between Kayseri and Sivas. Furthermore, apart from Sultanhanı, five other towns across Turkey owe their names to caravanserais built there. These are Alacahan in Kangal, Durağan, Hekimhan and Kadınhanı, as well as the township of Akhan within the Denizli metropolitan area. The caravanserai of Hekimhan is unique in having, underneath the usual inscription in Arabic with information relating to the tower, two further inscriptions in Armenian and Syriac, since it was constructed by the sultan Kayqubad I&#x27;s doctor (&quot;hekim&quot;), who is thought to have been a Christian convert to Islam. There are other particular cases, like the settlement in Kalehisar contiguous to an ancient Hittite site near Alaca, founded by the Seljuk commander Hüsameddin Temurlu, who had taken refuge in the region after the defeat in the Battle of Köse Dağ and had founded a township comprising a castle, a madrasa, a habitation zone and a caravanserai, which were later abandoned apparently around the 16th century. All but the caravanserai, which remains undiscovered, was explored in the 1960s by the art historian Oktay Aslanapa, and the finds as well as several documents attest to the existence of a vivid settlement in the site, such as a 1463 Ottoman firman which instructs the headmaster of the madrasa to lodge not in the school but in the caravanserai.

The Seljuk palaces, as well as their armies, were staffed with ghilmān (), singular &quot;ghulam&quot;), slave-soldiers taken as children from non-Muslim communities, mainly Greeks from former Byzantine territories. The practice of keeping ghilmān may have offered a model for the later devşirme during the time of the Ottoman Empire.

==Numismatics==
The earliest documented Rum Seljuq copper coins were made in the first part of the twelfth century in Konya and the eastern Anatolian emirates. Extensive numismatic evidence suggests that, starting in the middle of the thirteenth century and continuing until the end of the Seljuk dynasty, silver-producing mints and silver coinage flourished, particularly in central and eastern Anatolia.

Most of Kilij Arslan II&#x27;s coins were minted in Konya between 1177–78 and 1195, with a small amount also occurring in Sivas, which the Rum Seljuks conquered from the Danishmendids. Sivas may have started minting coins in 1185–1186. The majority of Kılıj Arslan II&#x27;s coins are silver dirhams; however, there are also a few dinars and one or two fulūs (small copper coins) issues. Following his death the sultanate was divided among his sons. Muhyiddin Mesut, son of Kilij Arslan II, minted coins in the northwesterly cities of Ankara, Çankırı, Eskişehir, and Kaztamunu from 1186 to 1200. Tughril ibn Kılıç Arslan II&#x27;s reign in Erzurum, another son of Kilij Arslan II, minted silver dirhams in 1211–1212. 

The sun-lion and the equestrian are the two central motifs in the Rum Seljuq numismatic figural repertoire. The image of a horseman with two more arrows ready and his bow taut represents strength and control and is a representation of the ideal Seljuq king of the Great Age. The image initially appeared on Rum Seljuq copper coins in the late eleventh century. The first to add equestrian iconography to silver and gold coins was Suleiman II of Rûm(r. 1196–1204). Antalya minted coins with Kaykaus I&#x27;s name from November 1261 to November 1262. Between 1211 and 1219, the bulk of his coins are minted at Konya and Sivas.

A significant portion of the Islamic Near East may have experienced a &quot;silver famine&quot; owing to little, or very little, silver mintings from the eleventh and most of the twelfth centuries. However, at the start of the thirteenth century a &quot;silver flood&quot; occurred in Rum Seljuq territory when Anatolian silver mines were discovered. The fineness of Rum Seljuq dirhams is similar to that of dinars; frequently, both were struck using the same dies. The Seljuq silver coinage&#x27;s superior quality and prominence contributed to the dynasty&#x27;s affluence throughout the early part of the thirteenth century and explains why it served as a kind of anchor for the local &quot;currency community.&quot; The Empire of Trebizond and Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia silver coins were modeled after the fineness and weight specifications of Rum Seljuq coins.

==Dynasty==


As regards with the names of the sultans, there are variants in form and spelling depending on the preferences displayed by one source or the other, either for fidelity in transliterating the Persian variant of the Arabic script which the sultans used, or for a rendering corresponding to the modern Turkish phonology and orthography. Some sultans had two names that they chose to use alternatively in reference to their legacy. While the two palaces built by Alaeddin Keykubad I carry the names Kubadabad Palace and Keykubadiye Palace, he named his mosque in Konya as Alâeddin Mosque and the port city of Alanya he had captured as &quot;Alaiye&quot;. Similarly, the medrese built by Kaykhusraw I in Kayseri, within the complex (&quot;külliye&quot;) dedicated to his sister Gevher Nesibe, was named Gıyasiye Medrese, and the one built by Kaykaus I in Sivas as Izzediye Medrese.

<text>A diplomatic bag, also known as a diplomatic pouch, is a container with certain legal protections used for carrying official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government or other diplomatic, consular, or otherwise official entity. The physical concept of a &quot;diplomatic bag&quot; is flexible and it can take many forms (e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, crate or even a shipping container).

Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties. The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the container has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It may only contain articles intended for official use, though there have been numerous cases where the privileges of the diplomatic bag have been used to facilitate smuggling. Bags are often escorted by a diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention.
==Noteworthy shipments==
* During World War II, Winston Churchill reportedly received shipments of Cuban cigars by this method.
* Triplex was a British espionage operation in World War II which involved secretly copying the contents of diplomatic pouches of neutral countries.
* In 1964, a Moroccan-born Israeli double agent named Mordechai Louk was drugged, bound, and placed in a diplomatic mailing crate at the Egyptian Embassy in Rome, but was rescued by Italian authorities. The box that he had been sealed into &quot;had almost certainly been used before for human cargo,&quot; including possibly for an Egyptian military official who had defected to Italy several years before but then disappeared without a trace before reappearing under Egyptian custody and facing trial.
* The Canadian government sent Canadian passports and other material via a diplomatic bag to Tehran to assist in the exfiltration of six American diplomats who had evaded capture during the seizure of the United States embassy.
* During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentine government used a diplomatic bag to smuggle several limpet mines to their embassy in Spain, to be used in the covert Operation Algeciras, in which Argentine agents were to blow up a British warship in the Royal Navy Dockyard at Gibraltar. The plot was uncovered and stopped by the Spanish police before the explosives could be set.
* In the 1984 Dikko Affair, a former Nigerian government minister, Umaru Dikko, was kidnapped and placed in a shipping crate in an attempt to transport him from the United Kingdom back to Nigeria for trial. However, it was not marked as a diplomatic bag, which allowed British customs to open it. 
* In 1984, the Sterling submachine gun used to kill WPC Yvonne Fletcher from inside the Libyan Embassy in London was smuggled out of the UK in one of 21 diplomatic bags.
* In March 2000, Zimbabwe became the object of international political attention when it opened a British diplomatic shipment.
* In May 2008, a replacement pump for the toilet on the International Space Station was sent in a diplomatic pouch from Russia to the United States to arrive before liftoff of the next shuttle mission.
* In 2012, a shipment of cocaine was sent to the United Nations in New York in a bag disguised as a diplomatic pouch.
* In January 2012, Italy detected of cocaine smuggled in a diplomatic pouch from Ecuador, arresting five. Ecuador insisted it had inspected the shipment for drugs at the foreign ministry before it was sent to Milan.
*In November 2013, the UK government alleged that a British diplomatic bag had been opened by the Guardia Civil at the Gibraltar-Spanish border, sparking a formal diplomatic protest. The Spanish government responded that the bag, being transported from the Governor of Gibraltar by a courier company, and contained in a mailbag that held other packages, did not meet the criteria of being in transit between a diplomatic mission and a home government.
* In July 2020, Indian officials detected of gold smuggled in a concealed diplomatic consignment from the United Arab Emirates, which was seized at Thiruvananthapuram Airport in Kerala by the Indian Customs Department. India&#x27;s National Investigation Agency revealed that former local UAE consulate employees were involved in gold smuggling.

<text>Pumpherston is a village in West Lothian, Scotland. Originally a small industrial village housing works for the nearby shale mine and works, it now forms the eastern part of the new town of Livingston, which was constructed to the west of Pumpherston in the late 1960s and quickly grew to incorporate Pumpherston in its wider urban settlement, as defined by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The village of Uphall Station lies immediately to the north. It is twinned with the village of Mtarfa, Malta. 

==History==
In 1884 the Pumpherston Oil Works was built to extract and product shale oil and the village developed adjacent to the works to house employed staff and their families. Pumpherston was initially divided into two villages, south and north. The north village had 116 homes and a co-operative store by 1885. By 1888, the south village had two rows of houses, comprising 48 tenements that had been erected. By 1914, Pumpherston north village had continued to expand to over 220 houses, as well as a workingmans institute, library, hall and bowling green. The co-operative store building (West Calder Co-Operative) still occupies the corner site in the village and includes a clock tower.

The Pumpherston oil works was later merged into Scottish Oils Ltd, established by Anglo-Persian in 1919 along with four other Scottish oil shale companies (Young&#x27;s Paraffin Light &amp; Mineral Oil Company, Broxburn Oil Company, Oakbank Oil Company and James Ross &amp; Company Philpstoun Oil Works). The oil works however continued to grow as the principal refinery for the company, with the additions of a cracking plant, brickworks and a detergent plant. The main refinery closed in 1964 although the detergent plant continued to operate until the earlier 1990s. Most of the former workings have been removed and the area has now been redeveloped as a golf course and new housing.

The specific oil shale retort, invented in 1894 and marking the separation of the oil shale industry from the coal industry, is named after the village.

==Origin of the name==
There does not seem to be an unambiguous derivation for the origin of the name:
Various suggestions have been made as to the meaning of the name Pumpherston. One writer suggested it was from &#x27;pamper&#x27;, a short thickset man; another suggested it was from &#x27;pundler&#x27;, the official in the middle ages who impounded stray cattle. [A more likely] derivation is from [Brythonic] &#x27;ap Humphrey&#x27; meaning son of Humphrey.

Pomphray was probably [the name of] one of the Flemish (Belgian) noblemen invited by King David I and his grandson Malcolm IV to settle in Scotland in the twelfth century ... Pomphray would have been granted the lands north of the Almond in return for serving the king in battle ... around the castle built by Pomphray, probably a wooden structure later replaced by a stone building, would have grown up a little settlement and farm to house and feed his adherents and servants - Pomphray&#x27;s town.

Manu de Pomphray was a Belgian mercenary who was rewarded for his &quot;deeds&quot; by King Malcolm circa 1130-1145 
—Sybil Cavanagh et al.
==Archaeology==
There is evidence of the Roman occupation approximately two miles north east of Pumpherston - at Roman Camp, near Broxburn.

==Amenities==

Pumpherston shares a primary school, Pumpherston &amp; Uphall Station Community Primary School, with near neighbour Uphall Station. For secondary education is provided at nearby Broxburn Academy.

Pumpherston has a variety of sporting amenities including Pumpherston Golf Club, Pumpherston Bowling Club and Recreation Park, the home of Pumpherston Juniors Football Club (Pumpherston F.C.).

In 2005 Pumpherston United F.C was formed to provide an opportunity for children from Pumpherston and the surrounding areas to take part in regular sporting activities. In only its third year the youth football club achieved an Access Level Award through West Lothian Council&#x27;s Community Sports Club Development Scheme. The certificate awarded to the club confirms that Pumpherston United F.C demonstrates appropriate levels of efficiency in Child Protection, Good Coaching Practice, Club Management and First Aid.

&quot;Dukla Pumpherston&quot; is a charity football team that originates from a fictional football team used by the comedian Tony Roper in the 1980s for the Naked Radio show. The name &quot;Dukla Pumpherston&quot; is said to originate from a play entitled &quot;The Broons&quot; held in Pumpherston Scout Hall circa 1982. However, the team now play to raise funds and awareness for various charities.

==Transport==
Uphall Station road is the main road through the village. The nearest railway station is Uphall railway station which lies to the north of Pumpherston at Uphall Station village.

Lothian Country operate bus service 72 between Fauldhouse &amp; Kirkliston via Whitburn, Livingston, Broxburn &amp; Winchburgh calling at the town.

==Music==
Kerry McGregor, who had success with many ventures including the Eurovision Song Contest qualifiers and X Factor, as well as acting, came from Pumpherston.

<text>Brights Grove is a neighbourhood of Sarnia, Lambton County, Ontario, Canada. Brights Grove is located on the shore of Lake Huron.

==History==
=== The Owenite Project ===
Brights Grove was the site of Canada&#x27;s first commune. In 1829, Brights Grove was established along the model of Robert Owen&#x27;s New Lanark, Scotland project by Henry Jones (1776–1852). The colony was named &#x27;Maxwell&#x27; and was a short-lived project. However, it has been argued by Canadian socialist historian Ian McKay that &quot;[t]he builders of the short-lived colony named Maxwell that Jones planted near Sarnia may well have been the first people in North America to call themselves &#x27;socialists&#x27;.&quot;

In the 1970s, the Ontario Heritage Foundation erected an historical plaque recognizing the site with the following text:
In 1829, Henry Jones of Devon, England, a retired purser in the Royal Navy, brought a group of more than 50 emigrants from the United Kingdom to this area where he established a settlement on a tract of land on Lake Huron. An early supporter and dedicated follower of Robert Owen, the well-known British social reformer. [sic] Jones named the settlement &quot;Maxwell&quot; and organized the community on the basis of common ownership and collective living. The settlers built a large log house with community kitchen and dining-room but separate rooms for each family. A school and storehouse were added. Within a few years, however, disappointing harvests and the burning of the log house led the colonists gradually to abandon the enterprise.
=== Faethorne House ===
In 1875, Col. Robert F. Faethorne built what is now known as the Faethorne House. Faethorne built the house on the most easterly of the five farms (the &quot;East Range&quot;) into which the land grant of Henry Jones, Faethorne&#x27;s father-in-law, had been divided. Robert Faethorne had married Jones&#x27; daughter, Elizabeth, and farmed the East Range. Faethorne was interested in race horses, imported trees to beautify his property and took an active part in the militia. In 1862, he was promoted to full colonel to command the local military district until after the Fenian alarms of 1866 and 1868.

On Faethorne&#x27;s death in 1897, the house was sold to Angus Jamieson. In 1921, it was purchased by H.F. Holland who restored it and the grounds. In 1934, it achieved notoriety when John Labatt, of the brewing family, who had rented it for the summer, was kidnapped on his way to London. In 1938, the house was sold once more. Under the name of Wildwood, it began a long career as a summer resort and golf club. By 1978, it was badly in need of repairs when it passed into the hands of Sarnia Township. It was restored to its present condition and started a new life as the Brights Grove library and Gallery in the Grove.

=== Big band era ===
Brights Grove hosted many top performers at the Kenwick dance hall.

In the late 1940s, Kenwick-on-the-Lake was open air in the round. The venue served as a Saturday night destination for passengers of the SS &quot;Noronic&quot; that stopped at Sarnia on its trip around the Great Lakes from Toronto until it burnt out alongside the quay in Toronto.
Bands that performed at the dance hall include Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton. There was also boxing.

Later years saw rock acts, such as Alice Cooper.

The structure was destroyed by fire and is now a basketball court on the lakefront.

=== Salmon fishery ===
Brights Grove has two creeks that attract salmon during the spring fishery. Cow Creek and Perch Creek. The Bluewater Anglers in Sarnia stock salmon, rainbow trout, and brown trout into Lake Huron.

==Arts and culture==
=== Lake Huron Waterfront Walking Trails ===
There are 8 kilometres of lakefront walking trails, half is on rural road and other on dedicated bike/walk path.

=== Howard Watson Nature Trail ===
Brights Grove is located halfway on a 25 km nature trail from Sarnia to Camlachie. It is a good rail path, crosses numerous creeks (including Cow &amp; Perch Creek), and is well maintained. Visitors can do a loop of rail path and lakefront around Brights Grove of 20 km or more.

<text>The Berliner Funkturm or Funkturm Berlin (Berlin Radio Tower) is a former broadcasting tower in Berlin, Germany. Constructed between 1924 and 1926 to designs by the architect Heinrich Straumer, it was inaugurated on 3 September 1926, on the occasion of the opening of the third Große Deutsche Funkausstellung (Great German Radio Exhibition) in the grounds of the Messe Berlin trade fair in the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Nicknamed &quot;der lange Lulatsch&quot; (&quot;the lanky lad&quot;), the tower is one of the best-known points of interest in the city of Berlin and, while no longer used for broadcasting purposes, it remains a protected monument.

==Construction method==
The tower is built as one large steel framework construction, similar to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The and approximately 600-metric ton radio tower was originally planned strictly as a transmitting tower, but later additions included a restaurant at a height of approximately 52 m, and observation deck at a height of approximately 125 m. Visitors reach the restaurant and the observation deck by an elevator which travels up to 6 meters per second.

The radio tower has two very notable structural characteristics. First, it sits on a square surface area merely 20 meters to a side. Its ratio of surface area to height is 1:6.9. For comparison, the Eiffel Tower sits on a square 129 meters to a side, giving surface-area-to-height ratio of 1:2.3. Second, the radio tower is probably the only observation tower in the world standing on porcelain insulators. It was designed as the support tower for a T-antenna for medium wave, and the insulators were intended to prevent the drain of the transmitting power down through the tower itself. However, this was impractical, because visitors would have been vulnerable to massive electric shocks, so the tower was later grounded via its elevator shaft. The insulators used were manufactured in the &quot;Koeniglich Preussische Porzellanmanufaktur&quot; (Royal Prussian Porcelain Factory).

On March 22, 1935, the first regular television program in the world was broadcast from an aerial on the top of the tower. In 1962, the tower stopped being used for West German television transmissions. In 1973, the radio tower stopped serving as a regular transmission tower for broadcasting purposes, but it is still used as relay station for police radio, and mobile phone services. The last complete renovation took place in 1987 in honor of the 750th anniversary of the founding of Berlin.

== Chronicle of the Berliner Funkturm ==
* December 1924: After the end of the First Radio Exhibition, construction of the radio tower was started. For this fair, at the location of the today&#x27;s radio tower, a 120 meters tall antenna mast was erected, which served as crane for building the tower.
* April 1925: The radio tower is finished in the infrastructure.
* September 25, 1925: Inauguration of the transmitter on medium wave frequency 520.8 kHz. A single T-antenna was strung between the top of the tower and an 80-meter-high guyed steel framework mast.
* 1925–26: To protect visitors from electrical hazards, the radio tower was grounded about its elevator shaft, although this directed the beam of the radio transmitter away from the center of Berlin.
* March 28, 1926: Acceptance of the radio tower by the construction offices.
* September 3, 1926: Radio tower opened to the public at the inauguration of the Third Great German Radio Exhibition (&quot;Funkausstellung&quot;).
* 1929: Retuning of the medium wave transmitter to 716 kHz, first television transmission tests.
* December 20, 1933: The new large transmitter in Berlin Tegel takes over the broadcast transmissions from the radio tower. After this, the medium wave transmitter at the radio tower is only a backup transmitter for Berlin Tegel.
* 1934: Retuning of the medium wave transmitter (as a backup unit for Berlin Tegel), to 834 kHz
* March 22, 1935: From an antenna of the top of the radio tower, the first regular television program of the world is transmitted
* August 22, 1935: Major fire in the exhibition hall at the radio tower destroys all transmission devices at the radio tower. Flying sparks also burn out the tower restaurant.
* December 23, 1935: Resumption of television broadcasts.
* 1938: Television transmitting equipment removed from the tower.
* 1939–1945: The radio tower serves as a warning and observation post.
* April 19, 1945: Projectiles destroy one of the four legs of the tower at a height of 38 meters. The restaurant is again burned out.
* 1945: Repair of the destroyed tower leg with 800 kg screws and 7.2 tons steel.
* 1948: Experiments with directed radio transmission toward the mountain of Harz.
* May 28, 1950: The tower restaurant reopens.
* 1951: Assembly of one superturnstile antenna on the top of the tower for the broadcast of FM radio and television programs. With this antenna, the tower grew around 12 meters, from 138 meters to 150 meters.
* October 1, 1951: Resumption of the television transmissions which were disrupted by World War II and the immediate post-war period.
* May 15, 1963: After completion of the 230-meter-high transmission mast near Scholzplatz, regular transmissions of television and broadcast programs from the tower were almost terminated.

<doc id="580324" wikidata="Q10862306" url="?curid=580324" title="TwinBee (series)">
<text>is a video game series composed primarily of cartoon-themed vertical-scrolling shoot-&#x27;em-up games produced by Konami that were released primarily in Japan. The series originated as a coin-operated video game simply titled &quot;TwinBee&quot; in 1985, which was followed by several home versions and sequels. The character designs of almost every game in the series since &quot;Detana!! TwinBee&quot; in 1991 were provided by Japanese animator Shuzilow HA (Jujiro Hamakawa), who also planned and supervised most of the subsequent installments in the &quot;TwinBee&quot; series. The series also inspired a radio drama adaptation that lasted three seasons in Japan, as well as an anime adaptation.

==History==
The series centers around a blue bee-shaped anthropomorphic spacecraft named TwinBee, who is usually accompanied by a pink &quot;female&quot; counterpart known as WinBee. In most games, the first player controls TwinBee while WinBee is controlled by the second player. A third ship also exists named GwinBee, a green counterpart to TwinBee and WinBee who in most games serves as a power-up, but in some instances also appear as a third playable spacecraft. In contrast to the serious sci-fi theme of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Gradius&quot; series, the &quot;TwinBee&quot; series is set in a cartoon-like world featuring several kinds of anthropomorphic creatures in addition to regular human characters. The player controls their spacecraft in most games shooting or punching at airborne enemies while throwing bombs at enemies on the ground, similarly to Namco&#x27;s &quot;Xevious&quot;. The main power-ups in the &quot;TwinBee&quot; are yellow bells that the player can uncover by shooting at the floating clouds. The player must shoot these bells to keep them afloat and after shooting them a number of times, they will change colour, allowing the player to add new abilities to their spacecraft.

Despite being one of Konami&#x27;s most prominent series in Japan during most of the 1990s, only a select few titles were localized for the foreign market, particularly the second console game &quot;Moero! TwinBee&quot; (which was released in America under the changed title &quot;Stinger&quot;); the two SNES installments, &quot;Pop&#x27;n TwinBee&quot; and &quot;Pop&#x27;n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures&quot;, in Europe and &quot;TwinBee Da!!&quot; for Game Boy, which was released in Europe as a standalone title with the name &quot;Pop&#x27;n TwinBee&quot; and later in compilations. The second arcade game, &quot;Detana!! TwinBee&quot;, also had a limited international release under the name of &quot;Bells &amp; Whistles&quot;. The original arcade game was featured in the Nintendo DS compilation &quot;Konami Classics Series: Arcade Hits&quot; under the name &quot;RainbowBell&quot; (the European compilation, however, uses the original &quot;TwinBee&quot; name).

==List of games==

* TwinBee, released on March 5, 1985: An original arcade vertical shooter, &quot;TwinBee&quot; plays similar to Namco&#x27;s &quot;Xevious&quot;. Players use TwinBee or WinBee in a short string of six levels that repeats indefinitely, with a boss at the end of each. A Family Computer (Famicom) and an MSX version were made in 1986. The Famicom version was re-released for the Game Boy Advance under Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom Mini label in Japan only. It was released in North America as part of an arcade compilation for Nintendo DS in March 2007, where it was renamed &quot;RainbowBell&quot;; when the compilation was released in Europe, the &quot;TwinBee&quot; name was restored.
** TwinBee Deluxe, released on February 25, 2004: The mobile version just like a WinBee in a Deluxe game.
** Mini Famicom: TwinBee, released on May 21, 2004: The Famicom version was re-released for Game Boy Advance as part of the Mini Famicom line.
** 3D Classics: TwinBee, released on August 10, 2011: The game was also redone in 3D and released on the Nintendo eShop under Nintendo&#x27;s 3D Classics line.
* Stinger, released on November 21, 1986 and in 1987 in America, this is the first game in the &quot;TwinBee&quot; series that was released in North America. Some enemy force kidnaps Dr. Cinnamon (creator of the TwinBee ships) and TwinBee, WinBee and GwinBee must rescue him. The Japanese version for the Family Computer Disk System in 1986, this game allowed up to three players simultaneously. Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Stinger&quot; has horizontal shooter levels (like &quot;Gradius&quot;) in addition to the vertical ones. Since the Disk System extension was not released in North America, the American version was released as a cartridge, but it lost the three-player mode (only allowing for up to two players), the story scenes were removed and the difficulty was altered. &quot;Moero! TwinBee&quot;&#x27; was re-released in cartridge format in 1993 with a new easy mode added.
* TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō, released on September 29, 1989. This is the last game in the &quot;TwinBee&quot; series for the Famicom to be released and the third game in the series. It ditches &quot;Stinger&quot;″s horizontal levels, which makes this more in line with the first title.
* Pop&#x27;n TwinBee, first released on October 12, 1990, in Japan and in autumn 1994 in Europe, the game is a sequel for the Game Boy to the original &quot;TwinBee&quot;. In Japan, it is known as TwinBee Da!!. Despite the European title, the Japanese version actually predates the release of the Super Famicom version of &quot;Pop&#x27;n TwinBee&quot; by three years. A colorized version of the game is featured in &quot;Konami GB Collection Vol. 2&quot; in Japan and &quot;Konami GB Collection Vol. 3&quot; in Europe. A full remake is featured in &quot;TwinBee Portable&quot; for PlayStation Portable.
* Detana!! TwinBee (also known as Bells &amp; Whistles outside Japan), first released on February 21, 1991: An arcade release, also ported to the PC Engine (which was ported to Virtual Console), Sharp X68000, PlayStation and Sega Saturn (the latter two bundled with &quot;TwinBee Yahho!&quot;). It has no relation to the original and Famicom games. While not too different from its predecessors, gameplay-wise, &quot;Detana!&quot; improves vastly on graphics and audio. It also introduces the current character cast, like TwinBee&#x27;s and WinBee&#x27;s characters (Light and Pastel, respectively) and other characters that would remain in the subsequent games. It was the most popular game in the series in Japan and paved the way for some merchandise products (including audio dramas and an original video animation). This also introduced cutscenes that played between stages, which usually showed Pastel and WinBee getting one up on Light and TwinBee.
* Pop&#x27;n TwinBee, first released on March 26, 1993, and later in 1993 in Europe: A SNES game, it is one of &quot;Detana!&quot;&#x27;s sequels, though they play differently. &quot;Pop&quot; uses a large energy bar, which results in game over if it depletes. When playing with two players, it is also possible to share energy.
* Pop&#x27;n TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventures (TwinBee: Rainbow Bell Adventure in Japan), released on January 7, 1994, in Japan and also in Europe during the same year. This SNES game meant the first real departure in the series. &quot;Rainbow Bell Adventures&quot; is a side-scrolling platformer. The game was also released in Europe, though the level order, some dialogue and the back-up system (the European version uses passwords, while the Japanese one uses battery) are different.
* TwinBee Taisen Puzzle-Dama published on December 9, 1994, in Japan. It is a puzzle video game for PlayStation; simple mechanics are part of a series of puzzle games &quot;Taisen Puzzle-Dama&quot; and takes its theme the world of &quot;TwinBee&quot;. The game was also planned to be released on the Sega Saturn in 1995 before it was cancelled.
* TwinBee Yahho!, released on April 19, 1995: Another sequel for &quot;Detana!&quot;, originally released in arcades, and later ported to the PlayStation and Saturn (along with &quot;Detana! TwinBee&quot;). The game included a vocal theme song, among other vocals, with WinBee greeting the arcade owner each time it is booted, and various snatches of dialogue from most of the characters, all voiced by the cast of TwinBee Paradise.
* Detana TwinBee Yahho! Deluxe Pack, a compilation released on September 29, 1995, in Japan for the PlayStation and subsequently ported to the Sega Saturn. It contains &quot;Detana!! TwinBee&quot; and &quot;TwinBee Yahho!&quot;.
* , released on February 26, 1998: More than a game, this is a CD-ROM with accessories inspired by the series (as a screensaver, etc.) for Windows 95.

<doc id="580329" wikidata="Q14058" url="?curid=580329" title="Fernsehturm Stuttgart">
<text>Fernsehturm Stuttgart () is a telecommunications tower in Stuttgart, Germany. It was the first telecommunications tower in the world constructed from reinforced concrete, and it is the prototype for many such towers worldwide. Although controversial at first, it quickly became a well known landmark of Stuttgart and a tourist attraction.

==Location==
The tower is located on the hill &quot;Hoher Bopser&quot; (elevation 483 meters) in the southern Stuttgart borough of Degerloch. From the observation decks there is a view of Stuttgart, from the forests and vineyards in and around Stuttgart to the Swabian Jura and the Black Forest.

The Waldau-Stadion (Gazi-Stadion auf der Waldau) is located near the tower; games played there are often described as &quot;under the TV tower&quot; or &quot;in the shade of the TV tower&quot;.

==History==
The tower&#x27;s construction was controversial – critics opposed the new building method and its costs; a simple 200-meter antenna array would have cost just 200,000 DM. Construction began on 10 January 1954 and continued for 20 months. This made it the first telecom tower in the world built with reinforced concrete. The construction cost was 4.2 million DM. Revenues from visitors reached that sum within five years. The tower was placed in service on 5 February 1956 by Süddeutscher Rundfunk (today Südwestrundfunk – SWR). It was part of the German state visit of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom in May 1965.

The tower reached its current height of after the antenna was extended from October 1965 to December 1965.

==Specifications==
* Engineer: Fritz Leonhardt
* Altitude: Foot of tower above sea level
* Overall height to the antenna point: 
* Height of upper observation deck: 
* Height of lower observation deck: 
* Diameter of foundation: 
* Total weight of tower: approximately 3,000 tons 
* Weight of foundation: approximately 1,500 tons 
* Speed of elevators: 
* Panorama Café on a platform of the tower basket 
* Maximum diameter of tower basket: 

==Broadcasting==
The tower is still known as &quot;Fernsehturm&quot; but today only broadcasts several public FM radio stations. Transmission of the ARD TV network&#x27;s analogue service stopped in 2006. The digital television services have moved to nearby &quot;Fernmeldeturm Stuttgart&quot;, which also broadcasts private FM radio stations in the area.

== Air traffic warning lights ==
The tower carries beside the conventional red air traffic warning lights three rotating xenon lamps similar to those used on lighthouses just above the observation deck.

==Public access==
On 27 March 2013 the tower was closed to the public because of a review of fire safety regulations. The tower was reopened on 30 January 2016 with a refurbished entrance, shop area and new, optimised fire safety precautions.

<doc id="580339" wikidata="Q1346570" url="?curid=580339" title="The Funk Brothers">
<text>The Funk Brothers were a group of Detroit-based session musicians who performed the backing to most Motown recordings from 1959 until the company moved to Los Angeles in 1972.

Its members are considered among the most successful groups of studio musicians in music history. Among their hits are &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, &quot;Baby Love&quot;, &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot;, &quot;Papa Was a Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, and &quot;Heat Wave&quot;. Some combination of the members played on each of Motown&#x27;s 100-plus U.S. R&amp;B number one singles and 50-plus U.S. Pop number ones released from 1961 to 1972.

There is no undisputed list of the members of the group. Some writers have claimed that virtually every musician who ever played on a Motown track was a &quot;Funk Brother&quot;. There are 13 Funk Brothers identified in Paul Justman&#x27;s 2002 documentary film &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;, based on Allan Slutsky&#x27;s book of the same name. These 13 members were identified by NARAS for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and were recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 2007, the Funk Brothers were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

==History==
Early members included bandleader Joe Hunter and Earl Van Dyke (piano and organ); Clarence Isabell (double bass); James Jamerson (bass guitar and double bass); Benny &quot;Papa Zita&quot; Benjamin and Richard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allen (drums); Mike Terry (baritone saxophone); Paul Riser (trombone); Robert White, Eddie Willis, and Joe Messina (guitar); Jack Ashford (tambourine, percussion, vibraphone, marimba); Jack Brokensha (vibraphone, marimba); and Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown (percussion). Hunter left in 1964, replaced on keyboards by Johnny Griffith and as bandleader by Van Dyke. Uriel Jones joined the band as a third drummer. Late-era bassist Bob Babbitt and guitarist Dennis Coffey both joined the ensemble in 1966.

While most of Motown&#x27;s backing musicians were African American, and many originally from Detroit, the Funk Brothers included white players as well, such as Messina (who was the featured guitarist on Soupy Sales&#x27;s nighttime jazz TV show in the 1950s), Brokensha (originally from Australia), Coffey, and Pittsburgh-born Babbitt.

===Fame and Funk Brothers name===
Unlike their Stax Records backing-band contemporaries Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s in Memphis, until the release of the &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot; documentary, the members of the Funk Brothers were little known. Studio musicians were not credited by Motown until Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; in 1971, although Motown released a handful of singles and LPs by Earl Van Dyke. The Funk Brothers shared billing with Van Dyke on some recordings, although they were billed as &quot;Earl Van Dyke &amp; the Soul Brothers&quot;, since Motown CEO Berry Gordy, Jr. disliked the word &quot;funk&quot;.

Alternatively, the name &quot;Funk Brothers&quot; could have been given to the band ex post facto; the term &quot;funky&quot; as an adjective came to be associated with uptempo and backbeat, Southern-styled soul music in the second half of the 1960s; the term &quot;funk&quot; as a noun is typically associated with uptempo soul music from the 1970s onwards. In the &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot; documentary, Joe Hunter stated that the name &quot;The Funk Brothers&quot; came from Benny Benjamin. Hunter said that Benjamin was leaving the studio (known as the &quot;Snake Pit&quot;, due to all the cable runs out of the ceiling) after session work, paused on the stairs, turned and said to his fellow musicians, &quot;You all are the Funk Brothers.&quot; The band was then informally named.

The Funk Brothers often moonlighted for other labels, recording in Detroit and elsewhere, in bids to augment their Motown salaries. It became a worst-kept secret that Jackie Wilson&#x27;s 1967 hit &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; did not have a Motown influence quite by accident—the Funk Brothers migrated to do the Wilson session, in an interesting reference to Motown&#x27;s early history: Berry Gordy, Jr got his first music break by getting Wilson to record some of his songs (including &quot;Reet Petite&quot;) in the 1950s. Various Funk Brothers also appeared on such non-Motown hits as The San Remo Golden Strings &quot;Hungry For Love&quot;, &quot;Cool Jerk&quot; (the Capitols), &quot;Agent Double-O Soul&quot; (Edwin Starr, before that singer joined Motown itself), &quot;(I Just Wanna) Testify&quot; by the Parliaments, &quot;Band Of Gold&quot; (Freda Payne), &quot;Give Me Just a Little More Time&quot; (The Chairmen of the Board), and blues musician John Lee Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Boom Boom&quot;. After he found out about the Edwin Starr session, Gordy fined members of the Funk Brothers band for moonlighting for another label; Eddie Wingate, owner of the Ric-Tic and Golden World labels, which released Starr&#x27;s &quot;Agent Double-O Soul&quot;, subsequently attended that year&#x27;s Motown staff Christmas party and personally gave each of the fined session players double the amount of the fine in cash, on the spot. Gordy eventually bought out Wingate&#x27;s label and his entire artist roster.

===Dissolution===
During the mid- to late-1960s, one-fifth of Motown records began using session musicians based in Los Angeles, usually covers and tributes of mainstream pop songs and showtunes. By 1970, Motown sessions were increasingly scheduled in Los Angeles instead of Detroit, including all of those for the Jackson 5&#x27;s hit recordings. Nevertheless, Motown producers such as Norman Whitfield, Frank Wilson, Marvin Gaye, and Smokey Robinson steadfastly continued to record in Detroit.

The Funk Brothers were dismissed in 1972, when Berry Gordy moved the entire Motown label to Los Angeles; a development some of the musicians discovered only from a notice on the studio door. A few members, including Jamerson, followed to the West Coast, but found the environment uncomfortable. For many of the L.A. recordings, members of the Wrecking Crew worked for Motown, including drummer Earl Palmer, percussionist Gary Coleman, bassist Carol Kaye, guitarist Tommy Tedesco, and keyboardist Larry Knechtel.

===Later years===
In February 2004, surviving members of the Funk Brothers were presented the Grammy Legend Award at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards at the Staples Center in Los Angeles in March 2006, some remaining Funk Brothers were invited to perform on Philadelphia writer-producer-singer Phil Hurtt&#x27;s recording session at Studio A, Dearborn Heights, Detroit, where they contributed their performances to &quot;The Soulful Tale of Two Cities&quot; project. The double-album sleeve notes read: &quot;Motown&#x27;s legendary Funk Brothers and members of Philadelphia&#x27;s world renowned MFSB take you &#x27;back in the day&#x27; with an album filled with classic Philly and Motown hits.&quot; Bob Babbitt, Joe Hunter, Uriel Jones, and Eddie Willis performed alongside other notable Detroit session musicians, like Ray Monette, Robert Jones, Spider Webb, and Treaty Womack. The musicians played on the Philly hits, giving their unique Detroit interpretations of the songs under the leadership of Phil Hurtt, Bobby Eli, Clay McMurray and Lamont Dozier. Many other ex-Motown and Detroit artists performed vocals on the session, including the Velvelettes, Carolyn Crawford, Lamont Dozier, Bobby Taylor, Kim Weston, Freda Payne, and George Clinton.

In 2008, Ashford and Riser played on Raphael Saadiq&#x27;s album &quot;The Way I See It&quot;, recorded in the style of the Motown Sound. That same year, the Funk Brothers&#x27; surviving members recorded &quot;Live in Orlando&quot;, an album and video.

In 2010, surviving members of the Funk Brothers accompanied Phil Collins on his Motown covers album, &quot;Going Back&quot;, and appear in the live &quot;Going Back&quot; concert DVD.

In 2010, the Funk Brothers were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

==Awards and recognition==
The Funk Brothers have received three Grammy awards:
* Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004
* Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance for &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; with Chaka Khan, 2002
* Best Compilation Soundtrack Album For A Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media for &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;, 2002.

Bassist James Jamerson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, and drummer Benny Benjamin in 2003. In 2003, surviving members were invited to the White House to meet President George W. Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, in an event tied to Black History Month.

In 2007, the Funk Brothers were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. On March 21, 2013, the Funk Brothers were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In August 2014, the Funk Brothers were inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Hall Of Fame at the induction ceremony, which was held in Canton, Ohio that year.

==Members==
As discussed above, the name &quot;The Funk Brothers&quot; was a loosely applied designation. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences recognizes 13 musicians as official &quot;Funk Brothers&quot;, but the name is often casually used as a catch-all designation to cover any musician who played on a Motown record.

The following list covers the musicians most frequently used on Motown recordings from 1959 through 1972; it is not an exhaustive list of every musician ever used. The 13 Funk Brothers recognized as official band members by NARAS are marked with an asterisk. Some also count backing vocalist trio the Andantes (Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps) as notable contributors to the Funk Brothers and Motown&#x27;s sound.

<text>The Blosenbergturm is a former radio transmission tower built for the German-language radio station DRS at Beromünster in the Canton of Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1937. It radiated first at 529 kHz and later at 531 kHZ, the lowest officially allocated frequency in the European medium-wave band.

The Blosenbergturm is a self-radiating tower insulated against ground, i.e. the entire tower structure is used as an antenna. With a total height of it is currently the sixth tallest structure in Switzerland. It has a cabin at a height of , containing a coil for feeding the pinnacle, which is insulated against the rest of the tower, separately with high frequency power. Originally the tower was used as a dipole antenna, fed from the cabin.

There was another, tall, freestanding lattice tower nearby, dismantled in 2011, which, like the Blosenbergturm, was a tower radiator insulated against the ground. This tower, which was built in 1931, carried – together with a second tower, which was dismantled and rebuilt at Sankt Chrischona near Basel as a television transmission tower – a T-antenna for medium wave until 1962. After this date, it was transformed into a tower radiator, serving as a backup transmitter for the Blosenbergturm itself.

The aircraft warning lights on the Blosenbergturm have a special feature: at dawn, a rotating beamer above the cabin comes into service. This beamer, which is much less bright than the beamers on the Stuttgart TV Tower, is switched off at night and the red aircraft warning lights are turned on. By watching the blinking light on the pinnacle of the tower, one could detect whether the transmitter was working. The high electrical field surrounding the top of the tower when the transmitter was powered meant that at such times the light glowed faintly, even in the blink breaks.

The Beromünster transmitter was shut down at midnight (CET) on 28 December 2008, despite some protests against the measure. The 1931 backup tower was dismantled in 2011; the Blosenberg tower itself was declared a heritage monument and may become part of an on-site museum.

<doc id="580345" wikidata="Q291827" url="?curid=580345" title="Chlamydomonas reinhardtii">
<text>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a single-cell green alga about 10 micrometres in diameter that swims with two flagella. It has a cell wall made of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, a large cup-shaped chloroplast, a large pyrenoid, and an eyespot apparatus that senses light.

&quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; species are widely distributed worldwide in soil and fresh water, of which &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; is one of the most common and widespread. &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; is an especially well studied biological model organism, partly due to its ease of culturing and the ability to manipulate its genetics. When illuminated, &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; can grow photoautotrophically, but it can also grow in the dark if supplied with organic carbon. Commercially, &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; is of interest for producing biopharmaceuticals and biofuel, as well being a valuable research tool in making hydrogen.

==History==
The &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; wild-type laboratory strain c137 (mt+) originates from an isolate collected near Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1945 by Gilbert M. Smith.

The species&#x27; name has been spelled several different ways because of different transliterations of the name from Russian: &quot;reinhardi&quot;, &quot;reinhardii&quot;, and &quot;reinhardtii&quot; all refer to the same species, &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; Dangeard.

==Description==
Cells of &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; are mostly spherical, but can range from ellipsoidal, ovoid, obovoid, or asymmetrical. They are 10–22 μm long and 8–22 μm wide. The cell wall is thin, lacking a papilla. The flagella are 1.5 to 2 times the length of the cell body. Cells contain a single cup-shaped chloroplast lining the bottom of the cell, with a single basal pyrenoid.

===Eye spot===
&quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; has an eyespot apparatus similar to that of dinoflagellates. The eyespot is located near the cell equator. It is composed of a carotenoid-rich granule layer in the chloroplast which act like a light reflector. The main function of the eyespot is the phototaxis, which consist of the movement (with the flagella) related to a light stimulus. The phototaxis is crucial for the alga and allows for localization of the environment with optimal light conditions for photosynthesis. Phototaxis can be positive or negative depending on the light intensity. The phototactic pathway consists of four steps leading to a change in the beating balance between the two flagella (the cis-flagellum which is the one closest to the eyespot, and the trans-flagellum which is the one farthest from the eyespot).

==Model organism==

&quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; is used as a model organism for research on fundamental questions in cell and molecular biology such as:

* How do cells move?
* How do cells respond to light?
* How do cells recognize one another?
* How do cells generate regular, repeatable flagellar waveforms?
* How do cells regulate their proteome to control flagellar length?
* How do cells respond to changes in mineral nutrition? (nitrogen, sulfur, etc.)

There are many known mutants of &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot;. These mutants are useful tools for studying a variety of biological processes, including flagellar motility, photosynthesis, and protein synthesis. Since &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; species are normally haploid, the effects of mutations are seen immediately without further crosses.

In 2007, the complete nuclear genome sequence of &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; was published.

Channelrhodopsin-1 and Channelrhodopsin-2, proteins that function as light-gated cation channels, were originally isolated from &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot;. These proteins and others like them are increasingly widely used in the field of optogenetics.

==Mitochondrial significance==
The genome of &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; is significant for mitochondrial study as it is one species where the genes for 6 of the 13 proteins encoded for the mitochondria are found in the nucleus of the cell, leaving 7 in the mitochondria. In species outside of Chlorophyceae, these genes are present only in the mitochondria and are unable to be allotopically expressed. This is significant for the testing and development of therapies for genetic mitochondrial diseases.

==Reproduction==
Vegetative cells of &quot;reinhardtii&quot; species are haploid with 17 small chromosomes. Under nitrogen starvation, vegetative cells differentiate into haploid gametes. There are two mating types, identical in appearance, thus isogamous, and known as mt(+) and mt(-), which can fuse to form a diploid zygote. The zygote is not flagellated, and it serves as a dormant form of the species in the soil. In the light, the zygote undergoes meiosis and releases four flagellated haploid cells that resume the vegetative lifecycle.

Under ideal growth conditions, cells may sometimes undergo two or three rounds of mitosis before the daughter cells are released from the old cell wall into the medium. Thus, a single growth step may result in 4 or 8 daughter cells per mother cell.

The cell cycle of this unicellular green algae can be synchronized by alternating periods of light and dark. The growth phase is dependent on light, whereas, after a point designated as the transition or commitment point, processes are light-independent.

==Genetics==
The attractiveness of the algae as a model organism has recently increased with the release of several genomic resources to the public domain. The Chlre3 draft of the &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; nuclear genome sequence prepared by Joint Genome Institute of the U.S. Dept of Energy comprises 1557 scaffolds totaling 120 Mb. Roughly half of the genome is contained in 24 scaffolds all at least 1.6 Mb in length. The current assembly of the nuclear genome is available online.

The ~15.8 Kb mitochondrial genome (database accession: NC_001638) is available online at the NCBI database. The complete ~203.8 Kb chloroplast genome (database accession: NC_005353) is available online.

In addition to genomic sequence data, there is a large supply of expression sequence data available as cDNA libraries and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Seven cDNA libraries are available online. A BAC library can be purchased from the Clemson University Genomics Institute. There are also two databases of &gt;50 000 and &gt;160 000 ESTs available online.

A genome-wide collection of mutants with mapped insertion sites covering most nuclear genes is available: https://www.chlamylibrary.org/.

The genome of &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; has been shown to contain N6-Methyladenosine (m6A), a mark common in prokaryotes but much rarer in eukaryotes. Some research has indicated that 6mA in &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; may be involved in nucleosome positioning, as it is present in the linker regions between nucleosomes as well as near the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes.

&quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; appears to be capable of several DNA repair processes. These include recombinational repair, strand break repair and excision repair. In particular, &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; chloroplasts possess an efficient system for repairing DNA double-strand breaks. In chloroplast DNA homologous recombinational repair is strongly stimulated by double-strand breaks.

==Experimental evolution==

&quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; has been used to study different aspects of evolutionary biology and ecology. It is an organism of choice for many selection experiments because :-
# it has a short generation time,
# it is both an autotroph and a facultative heterotroph,
# it can reproduce both sexually and asexually, and
# there is a wealth of genetic information already available.

Some examples (nonexhaustive) of evolutionary work done with &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; include the evolution of sexual reproduction, the fitness effect of mutations, and the effect of adaptation to different levels of .

According to one frequently cited theoretical hypothesis, sexual reproduction (in contrast to asexual reproduction) is adaptively maintained in benign environments because it reduces mutational load by combining deleterious mutations from different lines of descent and increases mean fitness. However, in a long-term experimental study of &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot;, evidence was obtained that contradicted this hypothesis. In sexual populations, mutation clearance was not found to occur and fitness was not found to increase.

== Motion ==
&quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; swims thanks to its two flagella, in a movement analogous to human breaststroke. Repeating this elementary movement 50 times per second the algae have a mean velocity of 70 μm/s; the genetic diversity of the different strains results in a huge range of values for this quantity. After few seconds of run, an asynchronous beating of the two flagella leads to a random change of direction, a movement called &quot;run and tumble&quot;. At a larger time and space scale, the random movement of the alga can be described as an active diffusion phenomenon.

==DNA transformation techniques==
Gene transformation occurs mainly by homologous recombination in the chloroplast and heterologous recombination in the nucleus. The &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; chloroplast genome can be transformed using microprojectile particle bombardment or glass bead agitation, however this last method is far less efficient. The nuclear genome has been transformed with both glass bead agitation and electroporation. The biolistic procedure appears to be the most efficient way of introducing DNA into the chloroplast genome. This is probably because the chloroplast occupies over half of the volume of the cell providing the microprojectile with a large target. Electroporation has been shown to be the most efficient way of introducing DNA into the nuclear genome with maximum transformation frequencies two orders of magnitude higher than obtained using glass bead method.

==Practical uses==
===Production of biopharmaceuticals===
Genetically engineered &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; has been used to produce a mammalian serum amyloid protein (needs citation), a human antibody protein (needs citation), human Vascular endothelial growth factor, a potential therapeutic Human Papillomavirus 16 vaccine, a potential malaria vaccine (an edible algae vaccine), and a complex designer drug that could be used to treat cancer.

===Alternative protein source===
&quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; has been suggested as a new algae-based nutritional source. Compared to &quot;Chlorella&quot; and &quot;Spirulina&quot;, &quot;C. reinhardtii&quot; was found to have more Alpha-linolenic acid, and a lower quantity of heavy metals while also containing all the essential amino acids and similar protein content. Triton Algae Innovations was developing a commercial alternative protein product made from &quot;C reinhardtii&quot;.

===Clean source of hydrogen production===
In 1939, the German researcher Hans Gaffron (1902–1979), who was at that time attached to the University of Chicago, discovered the hydrogen metabolism of unicellular green algae. &quot;C reinhardtii&quot; and some other green algae can, under specified circumstances, stop producing oxygen and convert instead to the production of hydrogen. This reaction by hydrogenase, an enzyme active only in the absence of oxygen, is short-lived. Over the next thirty years, Gaffron and his team worked out the basic mechanics of this photosynthetic hydrogen production by algae.

To increase the production of hydrogen, several tracks are being followed by the researchers.
* The first track is decoupling hydrogenase from photosynthesis. This way, oxygen accumulation can no longer inhibit the production of hydrogen. And, if one goes one step further by changing the structure of the enzyme hydrogenase, it becomes possible to render hydrogenase insensitive to oxygen. This makes a continuous production of hydrogen possible. In this case, the flux of electrons needed for this production no longer comes from the production of sugars but is drawn from the breakdown of its own stock of starch.
*A second track is to interrupt temporarily, through genetic manipulation of hydrogenase, the photosynthesis process. This inhibits oxygen&#x27;s reaching a level where it is able to stop the production of hydrogen.
*The third track, mainly investigated by researchers in the 1950s, is chemical or mechanical methods of removal of O2 produced by the photosynthetic activity of the algal cells. These have included the addition of O2 scavengers, the use of added reductants, and purging the cultures with inert gases. However, these methods are not inherently scalable, and may not be applicable to applied systems. New research has appeared on the subject of removing oxygen from algae cultures, and may eliminate scaling problems.
*The fourth track has been investigated, namely using copper salts to decouple hydrogenase action from oxygen production.
*The fifth track has been suggested to reroute the photosynthetic electron flow from fixation in Calvin cycle to hydrogenase by applying short light pulses to anaerobic algae or by depleting the culture of . Under pulse-illumination conditions, algae produce H2 via the most efficient mechanism of direct water biophotolysis, proceeding in two distinct steps:

 1. Photosystem II-dependent water oxidation reaction:
 2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e⁻;

 2. Hydrogenase-dependent reversible reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen:
 4H+ + 4e⁻ ⇄ 2H2.
If the water oxidation reaction leading to O2 production is balanced with O2 consumption, either by respiration or by introducing additional O2 absorbents or scavengers, the photosynthetic production of H2 can be sustained for a prolonged period. This balance prevents the inhibition of hydrogenase activity by accumulated O2, ensuring steady hydrogen production under these optimized conditions.

<text>Fallturm Bremen is a drop tower at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity at the University of Bremen in Bremen. It was built between 1988 and 1990, and includes a 122-metre-high drop tube (actual drop distance is 110 m), in which for 4.74 seconds (with release of the drop capsule), or for over 9 seconds (with the use of a catapult, installed in 2004) weightlessness can be produced. The entire tower, formed out of a reinforced concrete shank, is 146 metres high.

The 122-metre drop tube is free-standing within the concrete shell, in order to prevent the transmission of wind-induced vibrations, which could otherwise result in the airtight drop capsule hitting the walls. The drop tube is pumped down prior to every free-fall experiment to about 10 Pa (~ 1/10 000 atmosphere). Evacuation takes about 1.5 hours.

In 2021, German and French scientists at the drop tube managed to produce and record the lowest temperature ever measured. Using quantum gas, they managed to achieve 38 trillionths of a degree above absolute zero.

<text>In Dzogchen, rigpa (; Skt. vidyā; &quot;knowledge&quot;) is knowledge of the ground. The opposite of &quot;rigpa&quot; is ma rigpa (&quot;avidyā&quot;, ignorance). A practitioner who has attained the state of &quot;rigpa&quot; and is able to rest in it continuously is called a Rigdzin or Rigma (see Vidyadhara), which may be used as a title either pre- or post-nominally.

==&quot;Rigpa&quot; (knowledge)==
&quot;Rigpa&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;vidyā&quot;, &#x27;knowledge&#x27;) is a central concept in Dzogchen. According to Ācārya Malcolm Smith:

&quot;Rigpa&quot; is the knowledge of the ground. It has also come to mean the &#x27;pristine awareness&#x27; that is the fundamental ground itself. Erik Pema Kunsang translates a text which provides basic definitions of &quot;rigpa&quot; and &quot;ma rigpa&quot; in a Dzogchen context:

Rigpa has two aspects, namely &quot;kadag&quot; and &quot;lhun grub&quot;. &quot;Kadag&quot; means &quot;purity&quot; or specifically &quot;primordial purity&quot;. &quot;Lhun grub&quot; in Tibetan normally implies automatic, self-caused or spontaneous actions or processes. As quality of &quot;rigpa&quot; it means &#x27;spontaneous presence&#x27; It may also mean &#x27;having a self-contained origin&#x27;, being primordially existent, without an origin, self-existent. This division is the Dzogchen equivalent of the more common Mahayana wisdom and compassion division.

Closely related terms are &quot;ye shes&quot; (Skt. &quot;jñāna&quot;, pristine consciousness) which is &quot;the original, unadulterated state of consciousness&quot; and wisdom (&quot;shes rab&quot;, Skt. &quot;prajña&quot;). Rigpa is also described as &quot;reflexively self-aware primordial wisdom.&quot; Thus, wisdom is nothing other than rigpa. The analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one&#x27;s true nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections; or like a crystal ball that takes on the colour of the material on which it is placed without itself being changed. The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified) is called &quot;rigpa&quot;.

Sam van Schaik translates rigpa as &quot;gnosis&quot; which he glosses as &quot;a form of awareness aligned to the nirvanic state, free from all delusion&quot;. He notes that other definitions of rigpa include &quot;free from elaborations&quot; (&quot;srpos bral&quot;), &quot;non conceptual&quot; (&quot;rtog med&quot;) and &quot;transcendent of the intellect&quot; (&quot;blo &#x27;das&quot;). It is also often paired with emptiness, as in the contraction &quot;rig stong&quot; (gnosis-emptiness).

The unconditioned nature of rigpa is described in the &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; as follows:

John W. Pettit notes that &quot;rigpa&quot; is seen as beyond affirmation and negation, acceptance and rejection, and therefore it is known as &quot;natural&quot; (&quot;ma bcos pa&quot;) and &quot;effortless&quot; (&quot;rtsol med&quot;) once recognized. Because of this, Dzogchen is also known as the pinnacle and final destination of all paths.

Ācārya Malcolm Smith also notes that the atemporal nature of the basis also applies to the presence of the basis in sentient beings as rigpa:

As Alexander Berzin notes, all of the good qualities (&quot;yon-tan&quot;) of a Buddha already &quot;are innate (&quot;lhan-skyes&quot;) to rigpa, which means that they arise simultaneously with each moment of rigpa, and primordial (&quot;gnyugs-ma&quot;), in the sense of having no beginning.&quot;

Dzogchen texts refer to the basis and its rigpa as it is present in sentient beings as the &quot;sugatagarbha.&quot; Vimalamitra&#x27;s Commentary states that &quot;because the aim of buddhahood exists in the manner of a seed in the pristine consciousness of one’s vidyā, there is definitely success through practice.&quot;

Dzogchen texts also describe how rigpa is connected to the energy body. Dzogchen tantras explain that rigpa can be located in the center of the human body, in the heart centre. The &quot;Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra&quot; states: &quot;The jewel present within the heart in the center of one’s body is great pristine consciousness.&quot;

Furthermore, the &quot;Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra&quot; states:

Dzogchen tantras also discuss the related topic of the energy body, mainly the nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindus (&quot;rtsa, rlung,&quot; and &quot;thig le&quot;; channels, winds and circles).

===Immanence===
According to Van Schaik, there is a certain tension in Dzogchen thought (as in other forms of Buddhism) between the idea that samsara and nirvana are immanent within each other and yet are still different. In texts such as the &quot;Longchen Nyingtig&quot; for example, the basis and rigpa are presented as being &quot;intrinsically innate to the individual mind&quot; and not &quot;as states to be attained or developed.&quot;

The &quot;Great Perfection Tantra of the Expanse of Samantabhadra’s Wisdom,&quot; using the Adi-Buddha Samantabhadra as a symbol for enlightenment, states:

Likewise, Longchenpa (14th century), writes in his &quot;Illuminating Sunlight&quot;:

In the Longdé texts (and in other works), a common term used to denote the immanent enlightened nature is &quot;bodhicitta&quot; (&quot;byang chub sems&quot;).

This lack of difference between these two states, their non-dual (&quot;advaya&quot;) nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn&#x27;t happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect &#x27;self-recognition&#x27; (&quot;rang ngo sprod&quot;) of what is already innately (&quot;lhan-skyes&quot;) there. According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as Nagarjuna&#x27;s &quot;Mulamadhyamakakarika&quot;, which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the &quot;doer&quot;, the &quot;going&quot; and the &quot;going to&quot; (i.e. the ground, path and fruit).

===Practice===

Dzogchen practices aim to attain rigpa and integrate this into everyday life:
The Menngagde or &#x27;Instruction Class&#x27; of Dzogchen teachings are divided into two parts: &quot;trekchö&quot; and &quot;tögal&quot; (thod rgal). Ron Garry: 
In Dzogchen, a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish rigpa from sems (&quot;citta&quot;, (grasping) mind). According to the 14th Dalai Lama, &quot;&quot;sems&quot; is the mind which is temporarily obscured and distorted by thoughts based upon the dualistic perceptions of subject and object.&quot; &quot;Rigpa&quot; is pure awareness free from such distortions. &quot;Cittata&quot;, the nature of mind, is the inseparable unity of awareness and emptiness, or clarity and emptiness, which is the basis for all the ordinary perceptions, thoughts and emotions of the ordinary mind.

Citing Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima, the 14th Dalai Lama states the full measure of rigpa occurs with the third vision.

==&quot;Ma rigpa&quot; (ignorance)==

&quot;Ma rigpa&quot; (&quot;avidyā&quot;) is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge. &quot;Ma rigpa&quot; is ignorance, delusion or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or Dharmata, which is associated with &quot;ye shes&quot; or pristine consciousness. Automatically arising unawareness (&quot;lhan-skyes ma-rigpa&quot;) exists because the basis has a natural cognitive potentiality which gives rise to appearances. This is the ground for samsara and nirvana.

When consciousness fails to recognize that all phenomena arise as the creativity (&quot;rtsal&quot;) of the nature of mind and misses its own luminescence or does not &quot;recognize its own face&quot;, sentient beings arise instead of Buddhas. &quot;Ma rigpa&quot; is explained in Vimalamitra&#x27;s &quot;Great&quot; &quot;Commentary&quot; as follows:

According to Vimalamitra&#x27;s &quot;Illuminating Lamp&quot;, delusion arises because sentient beings &quot;lapse towards external mentally apprehended objects&quot;. This external grasping is then said to produce sentient beings out of dependent origination. This dualistic conceptualizing process which leads to samsara is termed &quot;manas&quot; as well as &quot;awareness moving away from the ground&quot;. However, some beings do not lapse into dualism by externalizing their own display and instead immediately recognize all phenomena which arise from the basis as the insubstantial appearances of their own nature. These beings immediately become Buddhas.

Thus, out of the basis, sentient beings arise due to ignorance/delusion, while Buddhas arise due to recognition and wisdom. As Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche notes, a sentient being is &quot;empty cognizance suffused with ignorance&quot; while the mind of a Buddha is &quot;empty cognizance suffused with rigpa&quot;.

Longchenpa explains the process of how rigpa (rendered here as &quot;gnosis&quot;) lapses into ignorance in his &quot;Tsigdön Dzö&quot; as follows:

=== Three kinds of ignorance ===
The Seminal Heart texts posits &quot;three kinds of ignorance&quot; (&quot;ma rig pa gsum&quot;), which according to Higgins are &quot;three progressive phases of error&quot;:

* Ignorance of single identity that is the cause (&quot;bdag nyid gcig pa&#x27;i ma rig pa&quot;), the most fundamental ignorance and the source of all error. It is the primordial failure to recognize the single source of &quot;rigpa&quot; and &quot;ma rigpa&quot;, i.e. the nondual empty Essence of the Basis.
* Co-emergent ignorance (&quot;lhan cig skyes pa&#x27;i ma rig pa&quot;), which is related to not seeing arising appearances as they really are. It is the failure to recognize the Nature of the Basis (i.e. clarity) which arises simultaneously together with cognition.
* Conceptually elaborated ignorance (&quot;kun tu brtags pa’i ma rig pa&quot;), also known as imputed ignorance and relates to the imputation of false and dualistic concepts onto appearances, particularly related to &quot;self&quot; and &quot;other&quot;.

Longchenpa explains the three forms of ignorance as follows:
==Samsara and nirvana==
As Sam van Schaik notes, for authors like Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa, the basis has the potential to manifest in both a samsaric and a nirvanic modes. Therefore, even though rigpa is immanent, in sentient beings this rigpa is an unripened rigpa which often manifests as ordinary consciousness (&quot;shes pa&quot;) and which may become deluded if it does not recognize its own nature. Buddhahood is attained through the recognition of rigpa &quot;(rig pa&#x27;i ngo sprod&quot;) or self-recognition (&quot;rang ngo sprod&quot;) of what is immanently present.

Seminal Heart texts also indicate a subtle difference between terms associated with delusion (such as &quot;kun gzhi&quot; or &quot;alaya&quot;, and &quot;sems&quot; or mind) and terms associated with full enlightenment (&quot;Dharmakaya&quot; and &quot;rigpa&quot;). These terms stem from Indian Yogacara texts. In the Seminal Heart literature, the &quot;Ālaya&quot; and the &quot;Ālayavijñāna are&quot; associated with karmic imprints (&quot;vasana&quot;) of the mind and with mental afflictions (&quot;klesa&quot;). The &quot;alaya for habits&quot; is the basis (&quot;gzhi&quot;) together with ignorance (&quot;ma rigpa&quot;), which includes all sorts of obscuring habits and grasping tendencies. Thus, the &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; compares the &quot;Ālaya&quot; to muddy water (which hides the brightness of wisdom and rigpa) and defines it as non-recognition, while the &quot;Dharmakaya&quot; is compared to clear water and defined as &quot;undeluded awareness&quot;.

Regarding &quot;sems&quot; (mind) and &quot;rigpa&quot; (gnosis), the &quot;Longchen Nyingthig&quot; compares them to air and space respectively:

Longchenpa explains the difference thus:

==Relationship with Indian Buddhist philosophies==
Koppl notes that although later Nyingma authors such as Mipham attempted to harmonize the view of Dzogchen with Madhyamaka, the earlier Nyingma author Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo did not. Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra. In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama, in his book &quot;Dzogchen&quot;, concludes that Madhyamaka and Dzogchen come down to the same point. The view of reality obtained through Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen view of Rigpa can be regarded as identical. With regard to the practice in these traditions, however, at the initial stages there do seem certain differences in practice and emphasis.

According to Malcolm Smith, the Dzogchen view is also based on the Indian Buddhist Buddha-nature doctrine of the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras. According to the 14th Dalai Lama the Ground is the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind which is emptiness. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, Rangjung Dorje (1284–1339), the third Karmapa Lama (head of the Karma Kagyu) and Nyingma lineage holder, also stated that the Ground is Buddha-nature. According to Thrangu Rinpoche, &quot;whether one does Mahamudra or Dzogchen practice, buddha nature is the foundation from which both of these meditations develop.&quot;

<text>BREN Tower was a guyed steel framework mast, high, on the Nevada Test Site in Nevada, USA. &quot;BREN&quot; stands for &quot;Bare Reactor Experiment, Nevada.&quot; The structure was owned by the Department of Energy and maintained by National Security Technologies. Access to the tower area had been closed since July 2006. No reason for the closure has been given. As part of the Nevada Test Site, it was also located in restricted airspace (R-4808N).

==History==
Built by the Dresser-Ideco Company for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, it was first erected in 1962 in the atomic bomb test area at Yucca Flat, where it was used for an experiment intended to improve understanding the effects of radiation in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. A bare (unshielded) nuclear reactor on a hoist car could be moved to different heights on the tower; Japanese-type houses were built near the base of the tower and were bombarded with various intensities of radiation.

In 1966, after the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty banned open-air nuclear testing, the tower was dismantled and despite its immense size moved from its original location to Jackass Flats in Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site, where it was used for Operation HENRE (High Energy Neutron Reactions Experiment), a series of radiation measurement experiments using a small linear accelerator to provide neutrons.

==Specifications==
Constructed of fifty-one sections of high tensile steel, the structure was higher than the Empire State Building. It was supported by of guy wires designed to withstand winds exceeding . The tower was equipped with an outside hoist to lift scientific equipment, and a two-person elevator inside the tower moved at per minute. The tower weighed 345 tons (313 tonnes).

==Demolition==
The structure was demolished on May 23, 2012. The National Nuclear Security Administration listed reasons for the removal as safety concerns for nearby workers, unreasonable costs to restore the structure to working condition and hazards to air traffic.

<text>A caxixi () is a percussion instrument consisting of a closed basket with a flat bottom filled with seeds or other small particles. The round bottom is traditionally cut from a dried gourd. The caxixi is an indirectly struck idiophone. Like the maraca, it is sounded by shaking. Variations in sound are produced by varying the angle at which the caxixi is shaken, determining whether the contents strike the reed basket (softer sound) or the hard bottom (louder, sharper sound).

It is found across Africa and South America, but mainly in Brazil and Cuba, used in staging the ritual. In Brazil, the smaller-sized caxixi began to be played alongside the berimbau. The larger sized caxixi were first used on recordings by Airto Moreira, but it was Naná Vasconcelos who furthered the use of caxixi for rhythmic accompaniment and colors. In West Africa, it is used by singers and often alongside drummers. Natives believed the caxixi to summon good enchanted spirits and to ward off evil ones.

More modern caxixis are made out of metal and have a more cutting sound as a result.

<text>Ibzan ( &quot;ʾIḇṣān&quot;; ; , meaning &quot;illustrious&quot;) appears in the Hebrew Bible as the ninth of the Judges of Israel.

==Biography==
Little is said of Ibzan apart from this: 

Many scholars believe that the Bethlehem referred to in this passage is the Bethlehem in the territory of the Tribe of Zebulun, in Galilee (Joshua 19:15), rather than the more famous Bethlehem in the Tribe of Judah.

However, the Talmud (&quot;Bava Batra&quot; 91a) asserts that Ibzan is to be identified with Boaz from the Book of Ruth, who lived in the Bethlehem in Judah, and that he consummated his marriage with Ruth on the last night of his life.

<text>Elizabeth Witmer (née Gosar; born October 16, 1946) is a former Deputy Premier of Ontario, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 until 2012, representing Waterloo North and later Kitchener—Waterloo as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party.

In 2012, she was appointed as chair of the Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board.

==Background==
Witmer was born in Schiedam, Netherlands. She moved with her family to Ontario at a young age. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario, and later attended the Althouse College of Education. She did postgraduate work at the University of Waterloo. Witmer worked as a secondary school teacher from 1968 to 1980, in West Lorne, London and Guelph. She was named the &quot;Kitchener-Waterloo Woman of the Year&quot; in 1968.

==Politics==
Witmer began her political career as a school trustee, serving on the Waterloo County Board of Education from 1980 to 1990; she became its chair in 1984. She ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1987 election, but was defeated by Ontario Liberal Party Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Herb Epp in Waterloo North.

Epp retired before the 1990 provincial election, and Witmer again won the Progressive Conservative nomination in the riding. She was successful this time, defeating New Democrat Hugh Miller and Liberal Andrew Telegdi (later a federal Member of Parliament) to become the first female MPP to be elected in the region of Waterloo. The NDP scored an upset victory in this election while the Progressive Conservatives won only 20 of 130 seats for third-party status.

=== Cabinet appointment ===
There was a significant swing to the Progressive Conservatives in the 1995 provincial election, and Witmer was re-elected by more than 17,000 votes over her nearest opponent. On June 26, 1995, she was appointed Minister of Labour in the government of Mike Harris. In October 1997, she was promoted to the key portfolio of Minister of Health, replacing the more confrontational Jim Wilson.

Harris&#x27;s government was initially regarded by many as uniformly right-wing, although moderate Red Tory figures such as Witmer and Isabel Bassett eventually emerged in key portfolios. Witmer&#x27;s appointment as Minister of Health was generally interpreted as signalling that the government desired a more moderate approach to negotiations with the health sector. Despite this, she presided over a controversial restructuring process which included a number of government cutbacks.

Witmer was re-elected in the 1999 election, defeating Liberal Sean Strickland by just under 10,000 votes. On June 17, 1999 her portfolio was renamed the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 8, 2001, she became Minister of the Environment.

=== Ministerial Accomplishments ===

==== Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1996 ====
During her term as Minister of Labour Ms. Witmer overhauled the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Act, renaming it the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act and introduced entitlement benefits for mental stress for the first time.

===Cabinet positions===



=== 2002 PC leadership campaign and afterward===

She ran in the 2002 PC leadership election to succeed Harris as Tory leader and Premier, but placed fourth on the first ballot and threw her support to the eventual winner, Ernie Eves. In April 2002, she was appointed Deputy Premier and Minister of Education.

The 2003 election saw a significant backlash against the Conservative government. Witmer was re-elected in Kitchener—Waterloo defeating Strickland by a reduced margin of 1,501 votes. Moreover, she is considered to be one of the few moderates in a caucus dominated by the right-wing of the party. She was named as deputy leader of the opposition, and serves as her party&#x27;s critic on long-term care and women&#x27;s issues.

Witmer considered running to succeed Eves in the 2004 PC leadership election, but ultimately supported John Tory&#x27;s successful candidacy instead. Tory re-appointed Witmer as deputy leader. Her appointment was considered a notable victory for the centrist wing of the party. In the 2007 provincial election, Witmer won re-election by 4,917 votes.

In 2007, Equal Voice, a non-partisan organization dedicated to improving the status of women in politics, conducted an &quot;Ontario&#x27;s Greatest Female Premier&quot; contest to name the woman in politics whom respondents felt would make the best Premier of Ontario. Witmer won the contest, ahead of political activist Georgina Bencsik and federal Member of Parliament Olivia Chow.

===Resignation and appointment to WSIB===
On April 27, 2012 Witmer announced that she was resigning as an MPP, just seven months after the last election, and had accepted an appointment to head the Workplace Safety &amp; Insurance Board. She succeeded Steve Mahoney as chair. She revealed in September 2012 that she chose to accept the WSIB position because her husband Cam had recently been diagnosed with cancer. She stopped being chair on January 26, 2022.

== Chair of Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) ==

As Chair of one of North America’s largest insurance companies, Mrs. Witmer is responsible for overseeing
the WSIB’s transformation to a modern and sustainable workplace insurance system. One of Mrs. Witmer’s
most notable accomplishments as Chair is the elimination of the unfunded liability (UFL) in 2018, almost 
a decade ahead of the legislated timeline of 2027. For the first time in recent history the WSIB is over 100% 
funded

<text>In differential topology, the Hopf fibration (also known as the Hopf bundle or Hopf map) describes a 3-sphere (a hypersphere in four-dimensional space) in terms of circles and an ordinary sphere. Discovered by Heinz Hopf in 1931, it is an influential early example of a fiber bundle. Technically, Hopf found a many-to-one continuous function (or &quot;map&quot;) from the -sphere onto the -sphere such that each distinct &quot;point&quot; of the -sphere is mapped from a distinct great circle of the -sphere . Thus the -sphere is composed of fibers, where each fiber is a circle — one for each point of the -sphere.

This fiber bundle structure is denoted

:formula_1

meaning that the fiber space (a circle) is embedded in the total space (the -sphere), and (Hopf&#x27;s map) projects onto the base space (the ordinary -sphere). The Hopf fibration, like any fiber bundle, has the important property that it is locally a product space. However it is not a &quot;trivial&quot; fiber bundle, i.e., is not &quot;globally&quot; a product of and although locally it is indistinguishable from it.

This has many implications: for example the existence of this bundle shows that the higher homotopy groups of spheres are not trivial in general. It also provides a basic example of a principal bundle, by identifying the fiber with the circle group.

Stereographic projection of the Hopf fibration induces a remarkable structure on , in which all of 3-dimensional space, except for the z-axis, is filled with nested tori made of linking Villarceau circles. Here each fiber projects to a circle in space (one of which is a line, thought of as a &quot;circle through infinity&quot;). Each torus is the stereographic projection of the inverse image of a circle of latitude of the -sphere. (Topologically, a torus is the product of two circles.) These tori are illustrated in the images at right. When is compressed to the boundary of a ball, some geometric structure is lost although the topological structure is retained (see Topology and geometry). The loops are homeomorphic to circles, although they are not geometric circles.

There are numerous generalizations of the Hopf fibration. The unit sphere in complex coordinate space fibers naturally over the complex projective space with circles as fibers, and there are also real, quaternionic, and octonionic versions of these fibrations. In particular, the Hopf fibration belongs to a family of four fiber bundles in which the total space, base space, and fiber space are all spheres:

:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5

By Adams&#x27;s theorem such fibrations can occur only in these dimensions.

==Definition and construction==

For any natural number &quot;n&quot;, an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere, or n-sphere, can be defined as the set of points in an formula_6-dimensional space which are a fixed distance from a central point. For concreteness, the central point can be taken to be the origin, and the distance of the points on the sphere from this origin can be assumed to be a unit length. With this convention, the &quot;n&quot;-sphere, formula_7, consists of the points formula_8 in formula_9 with &quot;x&quot;12 + &quot;x&quot;22 + ⋯+ &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; + 12 = 1. For example, the -sphere consists of the points (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, &quot;x&quot;4) in R4 with &quot;x&quot;12 + &quot;x&quot;22 + &quot;x&quot;32 + &quot;x&quot;42 = 1.

The Hopf fibration of the -sphere over the -sphere can be defined in several ways.

===Direct construction===

Identify with and with (where denotes the complex numbers) by writing:

:formula_10

and

:formula_11.

Thus is identified with the subset of all in such that , and is identified with the subset of all in such that . (Here, for a complex number , where the star denotes the complex conjugate.) Then the Hopf fibration is defined by

:formula_12

The first component is a complex number, whereas the second component is real. Any point on the -sphere must have the property that . If that is so, then lies on the unit -sphere in , as may be shown by adding the squares of the absolute values of the complex and real components of 

:formula_13

Furthermore, if two points on the 3-sphere map to the same point on the 2-sphere, i.e., if , then must equal for some complex number with . The converse is also true; any two points on the -sphere that differ by a common complex factor map to the same point on the -sphere. These conclusions follow, because the complex factor cancels with its complex conjugate in both parts of : in the complex component and in the real component .

Since the set of complex numbers with form the unit circle in the complex plane, it follows that for each point in , the inverse image is a circle, i.e., . Thus the -sphere is realized as a disjoint union of these circular fibers.

A direct parametrization of the -sphere employing the Hopf map is as follows.

:formula_14
:formula_15

or in Euclidean 

:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19

Where runs over the range from to , runs over the range from to , and can take any value from to . Every value of , except and which specify circles, specifies a separate flat torus in the -sphere, and one round trip ( to ) of either or causes you to make one full circle of both limbs of the torus.

A mapping of the above parametrization to the -sphere is as follows, with points on the circles parametrized by .

:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22

====Geometric interpretation using the complex projective line====

A geometric interpretation of the fibration may be obtained using the complex projective line, , which is defined to be the set of all complex one-dimensional subspaces of . Equivalently, is the quotient of by the equivalence relation which identifies with for any nonzero complex number . On any complex line in there is a circle of unit norm, and so the restriction of the quotient map to the points of unit norm is a fibration of over .

 is diffeomorphic to a -sphere: indeed it can be identified with the Riemann sphere , which is the one point compactification of (obtained by adding a point at infinity). The formula given for above defines an explicit diffeomorphism between the complex projective line and the ordinary -sphere in -dimensional space. Alternatively, the point can be mapped to the ratio in the Riemann sphere .

====Fiber bundle structure====

The Hopf fibration defines a fiber bundle, with bundle projection . This means that it has a &quot;local product structure&quot;, in the sense that every point of the -sphere has some neighborhood whose inverse image in the -sphere can be identified with the product of and a circle: . Such a fibration is said to be locally trivial.

For the Hopf fibration, it is enough to remove a single point from and the corresponding circle from ; thus one can take , and any point in has a neighborhood of this form.

===Geometric interpretation using rotations===

Another geometric interpretation of the Hopf fibration can be obtained by considering rotations of the -sphere in ordinary -dimensional space. The rotation group SO(3) has a double cover, the spin group , diffeomorphic to the -sphere. The spin group acts transitively on by rotations. The stabilizer of a point is isomorphic to the circle group; its elements are angles of rotation leaving the given point unmoved, all sharing the axis connecting that point to the sphere&#x27;s center. It follows easily that the -sphere is a principal circle bundle over the -sphere, and this is the Hopf fibration.

To make this more explicit, there are two approaches: the group can either be identified with the group Sp(1) of unit quaternions, or with the special unitary group SU(2).

In the first approach, a vector in is interpreted as a quaternion by writing

:formula_23

The -sphere is then identified with the versors, the quaternions of unit norm, those for which , where , which is equal to for as above.

On the other hand, a vector in can be interpreted as a pure quaternion

:formula_24

Then, as is well-known since , the mapping

:formula_25

is a rotation in : indeed it is clearly an isometry, since , and it is not hard to check that it preserves orientation.

In fact, this identifies the group of versors with the group of rotations of , modulo the fact that the versors and determine the same rotation. As noted above, the rotations act transitively on , and the set of versors which fix a given right versor have the form , where and are real numbers with . This is a circle subgroup. For concreteness, one can take , and then the Hopf fibration can be defined as the map sending a versor . All the quaternions , where is one of the circle of versors that fix , get mapped to the same thing (which happens to be one of the two rotations rotating to the same place as does).

Another way to look at this fibration is that every versor ω moves the plane spanned by to a new plane spanned by . Any quaternion , where is one of the circle of versors that fix , will have the same effect. We put all these into one fibre, and the fibres can be mapped one-to-one to the -sphere of rotations which is the range of .

This approach is related to the direct construction by identifying a quaternion with the matrix:

:formula_26

This identifies the group of versors with , and the imaginary quaternions with the skew-hermitian matrices (isomorphic to ).

====Explicit formulae====

The rotation induced by a unit quaternion is given explicitly by the orthogonal matrix

:formula_27

Here we find an explicit real formula for the bundle projection by noting that the fixed unit vector along the axis, , rotates to another unit vector,

:formula_28

which is a continuous function of . That is, the image of is the point on the -sphere where it sends the unit vector along the axis. The fiber for a given point on consists of all those unit quaternions that send the unit vector there.

We can also write an explicit formula for the fiber over a point in . Multiplication of unit quaternions produces composition of rotations, and

:formula_29

is a rotation by around the axis. As varies, this sweeps out a great circle of , our prototypical fiber. So long as the base point, , is not the antipode, , the quaternion

:formula_30

will send to . Thus the fiber of is given by quaternions of the form , which are the points

:formula_31

Since multiplication by acts as a rotation of quaternion space, the fiber is not merely a topological circle, it is a geometric circle.

The final fiber, for , can be given by defining to equal , producing

:formula_32

which completes the bundle. But note that this one-to-one mapping between and is not continuous on this circle, reflecting the fact that is not topologically equivalent to .

Thus, a simple way of visualizing the Hopf fibration is as follows. Any point on the -sphere is equivalent to a quaternion, which in turn is equivalent to a particular rotation of a Cartesian coordinate frame in three dimensions. The set of all possible quaternions produces the set of all possible rotations, which moves the tip of one unit vector of such a coordinate frame (say, the vector) to all possible points on a unit -sphere. However, fixing the tip of the vector does not specify the rotation fully; a further rotation is possible about the axis. Thus, the -sphere is mapped onto the -sphere, plus a single rotation.

The rotation can be represented using the Euler angles &quot;θ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;, and &quot;ψ&quot;. The Hopf mapping maps the rotation to the point on the 2-sphere given by θ and φ, and the associated circle is parametrized by ψ. Note that when θ = π the Euler angles φ and ψ are not well defined individually, so we do not have a one-to-one mapping (or a one-to-two mapping) between the 3-torus of (&quot;θ&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;, &quot;ψ&quot;) and &quot;S&quot;3.

===Fluid mechanics===

If the Hopf fibration is treated as a vector field in 3 dimensional space then there is a solution to the (compressible, non-viscous) Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics in which the fluid flows along the circles of the projection of the Hopf fibration in 3 dimensional space. The size of the velocities, the density and the pressure can be chosen at each point to satisfy the equations. All these quantities fall to zero going away from the centre. If a is the distance to the inner ring, the velocities, pressure and density fields are given by:

:formula_33
:formula_34
:formula_35

for arbitrary constants and . Similar patterns of fields are found as soliton solutions of magnetohydrodynamics:

==Generalizations==

The Hopf construction, viewed as a fiber bundle &quot;p&quot;: &quot;S&quot;3 → CP&quot;1&quot;, admits several generalizations, which are also often known as Hopf fibrations. First, one can replace the projective line by an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space. Second, one can replace the complex numbers by any (real) division algebra, including (for &quot;n&quot; = 1) the octonions.

===Real Hopf fibrations===

A real version of the Hopf fibration is obtained by regarding the circle &quot;S&quot;1 as a subset of R2 in the usual way and by
identifying antipodal points. This gives a fiber bundle &quot;S&quot;1 → RP1 over the real projective line with fiber &quot;S&quot;0 = {1, −1}. Just as CP1 is diffeomorphic to a sphere, RP1 is diffeomorphic to a circle.

More generally, the &quot;n&quot;-sphere &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot; fibers over real projective space RP&quot;n&quot; with fiber &quot;S&quot;0.

===Complex Hopf fibrations===

The Hopf construction gives circle bundles &quot;p&quot; : &quot;S&quot;2&quot;n&quot;+1 → CP&quot;n&quot; over complex projective space. This is actually the restriction of the tautological line bundle over CP&quot;n&quot; to the unit sphere in C&quot;n&quot;+1.

===Quaternionic Hopf fibrations===

Similarly, one can regard &quot;S&quot;4&quot;n+3&quot; as lying in H&quot;n+1&quot; (quaternionic &quot;n&quot;-space) and factor out by unit quaternion (= &quot;S&quot;3) multiplication to get the quaternionic projective space HP&quot;n&quot;. In particular, since &quot;S&quot;4 = HP1, there is a bundle &quot;S&quot;7 → &quot;S&quot;4 with fiber &quot;S&quot;3.

===Octonionic Hopf fibrations===

A similar construction with the octonions yields a bundle &quot;S&quot;15 → &quot;S&quot;8 with fiber &quot;S&quot;7. But the sphere &quot;S&quot;31 does not fiber over &quot;S&quot;16 with fiber &quot;S&quot;15. One can regard &quot;S&quot;8 as the octonionic projective line OP1. Although one can also define an octonionic projective plane OP2, the sphere &quot;S&quot;23 does not fiber over OP2
with fiber &quot;S&quot;7.

===Fibrations between spheres===

Sometimes the term &quot;Hopf fibration&quot; is restricted to the fibrations between spheres obtained above, which are
* &quot;S&quot;1 → &quot;S&quot;1 with fiber &quot;S&quot;0
* &quot;S&quot;3 → &quot;S&quot;2 with fiber &quot;S&quot;1
* &quot;S&quot;7 → &quot;S&quot;4 with fiber &quot;S&quot;3
* &quot;S&quot;15 → &quot;S&quot;8 with fiber &quot;S&quot;7
As a consequence of Adams&#x27;s theorem, fiber bundles with spheres as total space, base space, and fiber can occur only in these dimensions. 
Fiber bundles with similar properties, but different from the Hopf fibrations, were used by John Milnor to construct exotic spheres.

==Geometry and applications==

The Hopf fibration has many implications, some purely attractive, others deeper. For example, stereographic projection &quot;S&quot;3 → R3 induces a remarkable structure in R3, which in turn illuminates the topology of the bundle . Stereographic projection preserves circles and maps the Hopf fibers to geometrically perfect circles in R3 which fill space. Here there is one exception: the Hopf circle containing the projection point maps to a straight line in R3 — a &quot;circle through infinity&quot;.

The fibers over a circle of latitude on &quot;S&quot;2 form a torus in &quot;S&quot;3 (topologically, a torus is the product of two circles) and these project to nested toruses in R3 which also fill space. The individual fibers map to linking Villarceau circles on these tori, with the exception of the circle through the projection point and the one through its opposite point: the former maps to a straight line, the latter to a unit circle perpendicular to, and centered on, this line, which may be viewed as a degenerate torus whose minor radius has shrunken to zero. Every other fiber image encircles the line as well, and so, by symmetry, each circle is linked through &quot;every&quot; circle, both in R3 and in &quot;S&quot;3. Two such linking circles form a Hopf link in R3

Hopf proved that the Hopf map has Hopf invariant 1, and therefore is not null-homotopic. In fact it generates the homotopy group π3(&quot;S&quot;2) and has infinite order.

In quantum mechanics, the Riemann sphere is known as the Bloch sphere, and the Hopf fibration describes the topological structure of a quantum mechanical two-level system or qubit. Similarly, the topology of a pair of entangled two-level systems is given by the Hopf fibration 
:formula_36
. Moreover, the Hopf fibration is equivalent to the fiber bundle structure of the Dirac monopole.

Hopf fibration also found applications in robotics, where it was used to generate uniform samples on SO(3) for the probabilistic roadmap algorithm in motion planning. It also found application in the automatic control of quadrotors.

<text>Artūras Paulauskas (born 23 August 1953 in Vilnius) is a Lithuanian politician. He was the Speaker of Seimas, the parliament of Lithuania, from 2000 to 2006, and he served as Acting President of Lithuania from 6 April 2004 to 12 July 2004.

==Early career==
Artūras Paulauskas graduated from Vilnius University with a degree in law in 1976. He then worked as an investigator and a prosecutor. He was Deputy Prosecutor General of Lithuania from 1987 to 1990 and Prosecutor General of Lithuania from 1990 to 1995. He was again Deputy Prosecutor General from 1995 to 1997 and was engaged in private legal practice from 1997 to 2000.

==Political career==
Artūras Paulauskas entered politics by running for President of Lithuania in the 1997–1998 elections. He was supported by outgoing President Algirdas Brazauskas and narrowly lost in the runoff to Valdas Adamkus, with Paulauskas gaining 49.6% of vote and Adamkus gaining 50.4%. He then established The New Union (Social Liberals) party, becoming its chairman on 25 April 1998. This party gained 19.6% of vote in the 2000 parliamentary election. Following this election, he became the Speaker of Seimas on 19 October 2000.

Following the impeachment of President Rolandas Paksas on 6 April 2004, Paulauskas served as acting President of Lithuania until early elections were held and a new president, Valdas Adamkus, was sworn on 12 July 2004.

On 11 April 2006, Paulauskas was removed from office as Speaker by 94 votes (only 11 parliamentarians voted against it). His party New Union (Social Liberals) did not participate in the election. Paulauskas was succeeded by Viktoras Muntianas.

Paulauskas was named as the candidate for the post of Minister of Environment by Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas on 30 January 2008. As Minister, he made a May 2008 statement at a meeting of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development supporting the use of renewable energy resources in Lithuania.

In 2015, news media reported that Paulauskas was included in a Russian blacklist of prominent people from the European Union who are not allowed to enter the country.

In 2015, Paulauskas called for a Burka Ban in Lithuania.

<doc id="580401" wikidata="Q1384530" url="?curid=580401" title="Tom Kite">
<text>Thomas Oliver Kite Jr. (born December 9, 1949) is an American professional golfer and golf course architect. He won the U.S. Open in 1992 and spent 175 weeks in the top-10 of the Official World Golf Ranking between 1989 and 1994.

==Early life and amateur career==
Kite was born in McKinney, Texas. He began playing golf at age six, and won his first tournament at age 11. Kite attended the University of Texas on a golf scholarship and was coached by Harvey Penick.

At Texas, Kite was a first-team All-American in 1972 when he also shared the individual NCAA championship with team mate Ben Crenshaw. He helped the Longhorns win two NCAA Team Championships in 1971 an 1972 and Southwest Conference Championships in 1970 and 1972. He was a second-team All-American in 1970 and 1971 and won nine collegiate tournaments during his four years. In 1984 he was inducted into the Longhorns Hall of Honor.

== Professional career ==
In 1972, Kite turned professional and was a consistent money winner until his retirement. Known for his innovation, he was the first to add a third wedge to his bag, one of the first players to use a sports psychologist, and one of the first to emphasize physical fitness for game improvement. He also underwent laser eye surgery, due to his partial blindness, in a bid to improve his game late in his career.

He has 19 PGA Tour victories, including the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. He competed on seven Ryder Cup squads (1979, 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1993) and served as the 1997 captain. Kite holds a unique record of making the cut for the first four U.S. Opens held at Pebble Beach: 1972, 1982, 1992, and 2000. Kite also shares the distinction (with Gene Littler) of playing in the most Masters Tournaments without a win.

Kite was the first in Tour history to reach $6 million, $7 million, $8 million, and $9 million in career earnings. He was the Tour&#x27;s leading money-winner in 1981 and 1989. In his prime, Kite had few peers with the short irons. In 1993, Johnny Miller referred to Kite as &quot;the greatest short-iron player the game has seen.&quot;

In 2005 he led the PGA Tour&#x27;s Booz Allen Classic by one shot going into the final round at the age of 55. If he had been able to stay ahead he would have beaten Sam Snead&#x27;s record as the oldest winner on the PGA Tour by three years, but he fell away to finish tied 13th, seven shots behind Sergio García.

Kite played the Champions Tour until 2020, claiming ten victories including one senior major, The Countrywide Tradition. At the 2012 U.S. Senior Open, Kite shot a front nine 28 (seven under par) in the first round. This was the lowest nine-hole score ever recorded in any USGA championship. He finished the tournament tied for 12th.

On May 18, 1991, Kite was impersonated by Kevin Nealon as part of the &quot;Carsenio&quot; sketch on Saturday Night Live featuring Dana Carvey impersonating Johnny Carson and Phil Hartman impersonating Ed McMahon. 

In 1996, Kite had a cameo in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Scenes from the Class Struggle in Springfield&quot;, in which he gave Homer Simpson golf tips.

== Awards and honors ==

* In 1973, Kite was noted as the &quot;Golf Digest&quot; Rookie of the Year.
* In 1979, Kite was awarded the Bob Jones Award.
* in 1981, Kite was awarded the Golf Writers Association Player of the Year.
* Kite was the Vardon Trophy winner in 1981 and 1982. 
* In 1989, he was named PGA of America Player of the Year. 
* In 2004, Kite was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

<text>Philip M. Hine is a British occultist and writer. He became known internationally through his written works &quot;Condensed Chaos&quot;, &quot;Prime Chaos&quot;, and &quot;Pseudonomicon&quot;, as well as several essays on the topics of chaos magic and Cthulhu Mythos magic. He has facilitated workshops and seminars on modern magical practice in America and Europe and contributed to a wide range of occult journals, having been most active from 1986 to 1996.

==Early life==
Growing up in Blackpool, Hine became involved with chaos magic theory in West Yorkshire in the 1980s. This was after he &quot;picked up the fabled white edition of &quot;Liber Null&quot; by Peter J. Carroll&quot; at Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice bookshop. During the early years of his studies of psychology and sociology he was influenced by the works of the Swiss psychiatrist C. G. Jung. 

==Career==
Hine was a founder and co-editor of occult magazine &quot;Pagan News&quot; in partnership with Rodney Orpheus. Hine subsequently published a series of booklets on urban shamanism in the late 1980s. 

His earliest popular work was a small pamphlet which outlined a brief and simple definition of magic, a brief history of the school of practice called chaos magic, and an outline of some of its basic approaches, which presented a number of simple techniques. This was followed in 1993 by &quot;Prime Chaos&quot;, which focused on the construction and uses of more formalised ritual techniques

In 1995, he expanded his earlier pamphlet under the same title, &quot;Condensed Chaos&quot;. This book focuses on the basic techniques and the style of doing magic that has become associated with chaos magic. It has been described by William S. Burroughs as &quot;the most concise statement of the logic of modern magic&quot;.

==Views==
Hine finds that the definition of &quot;black magic&quot; has been convoluted by people who define practices that they disapprove of as &quot;black magic&quot;.

==Personal life==
As of 1997 he resides in South London.

Hine is bisexual.

<doc id="580415" wikidata="Q1420441" url="?curid=580415" title="Fish finger">
<text>Fish fingers (British English) or fish sticks (American English) are a processed food made using a whitefish, such as cod, hake, haddock, or pollock, which has been battered or breaded and formed into a rectangular shape. They are commonly available in the frozen food section of supermarkets. They can be baked in an oven, grilled, shallow fried, or deep-fried.

==History==
The term &quot;fish finger&quot; is first referenced in a recipe given in a popular British magazine in 1900, and the dish is often considered symbolic of the United Kingdom by British people.

The food restrictions during and after WWII expanded the consumption of fish fingers, but companies struggled to maintain decent quality. The commercialization of fish fingers may be traced to 1953 when the American company Gorton-Pew Fisheries, now known as Gorton&#x27;s, was the first company to introduce a frozen ready-to-cook fish finger; the product, named &quot;Gorton&#x27;s Fish Sticks&quot;, won the &quot;Parents&quot; magazine Seal of Approval in 1956. The developer of those fish sticks was Aaron L. Brody.

There was an abundance of herring in the United Kingdom after World War II. Clarence Birdseye test-marketed herring fish fingers, a product he had discovered in the United States, under the name &quot;herring savouries&quot;. These were tested in Southampton and South Wales against &quot;cod fingers&quot;, a comparatively bland product used as a control. Shoppers, however, confounded expectations by showing an overwhelming preference for the cod. The snack was nearly called Battered Cod Pieces, until a poll of Birds Eye workers opted for the snappier Fish Fingers.

==Varieties==

Minced fish comes in industry standard 7.5 kg frozen blocks for further slicing and battering. These are more commonly used in store brand economy products. They may have either batter or breadcrumbs around the outside as casing, although the coating is normally breadcrumbs.

In addition to white fish, fish fingers are sometimes made with salmon.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Sweden frozen food brand Findus released a fish finger product with a coating of chips in place of breadcrumbs under the name &quot;Crostinos.&quot;

<doc id="580426" wikidata="Q7786191" url="?curid=580426" title="This Old House">
<text>This Old House is an American home improvement media brand with television shows, a magazine, and a website. The brand is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. The television series airs on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television network and follows remodeling projects of houses over a series of weekly episodes.

Boston PBS station WGBH-TV originally created the program and produced it from its inception in 1979 until 2001, when Time Inc. acquired the television assets and formed This Old House Ventures. WGBH also distributed episodes to PBS until 2019, when WETA-TV became the distributor starting with season 41. Warner Bros. Domestic Television distributes the series to commercial television stations in broadcast syndication. Time Inc. launched &quot;This Old House&quot; magazine in 1995, focusing on home how-to, know-how, and inspiration.
In 2016, Time Inc. sold This Old House Ventures to executive Eric Thorkilsen and private equity firm TZP Growth Partners (although it continued to have a special partnership deal with its former parent company). On March 19, 2021, Roku acquired This Old House Ventures.

==Overview==
&quot;This Old House&quot; and its sister series &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; are often broadcast together as &quot;The This Old House Hour&quot;, which was originally known as &quot;The New This Old House Hour&quot;. Both shows are owned by This Old House Ventures, Inc. and are underwritten by GMC and The Home Depot.

Two of the original underwriters were Weyerhauser and Owens-Corning. Weyerhauser, a lumber distributor, had donated more than $1,000,000 a year to the show by 1989. &quot;This Old House&quot; is also underwritten by State Farm Insurance, HomeServe, and Marvin Windows and Doors. Other underwriters throughout the show&#x27;s tenure have included Parks Corporation, Glidden, Montgomery Ward, Ace Hardware, Kohler, Schlage, Century 21 Real Estate, Toro, ERA Real Estate, Angie&#x27;s List, Amica Mutual Insurance, GAF, Mitsubishi Electric, and Lumber Liquidators.

The third series to share the name is &quot;Inside This Old House&quot;, a retrospective featuring highlights from previous episodes. Old episodes are also shown under the program name &quot;This Old House Classics&quot; and were formerly shown on TLC under the name &quot;The Renovation Guide&quot;. Only the episodes with original host Bob Vila aired under that name. , &quot;Classics&quot; are also carried on the commercial non-broadcast DIY Network as well as syndicated to local TV stations.

&quot;This Old House&quot; was one of the earliest home improvement shows on national television. As such, it was initially controversial among building contractors, and some cast members were afraid that they were giving away secrets of the building trades. As time passed the show grew into a cultural icon, and producer-director Russell Morash became known as the &quot;Father of How-To&quot;.

==History==

Begun in 1979 as a one time, thirteen part series airing on WGBH, &quot;This Old House&quot; has grown into one of the most popular programs on the network. It has produced spin-offs (notably &quot;The New Yankee Workshop&quot; hosted by Norm Abram), a magazine, and for-profit websites. The show has won seventeen Emmy Awards and received 82 nominations.

Although WGBH acquired the first two project houses (6 Percival Street in Dorchester and the Bigelow House in Newton) for renovation, the series originally focused on renovating older houses, including those of modest size and value, with the homeowners doing some of the work as a form of sweat equity. The series covering the renovation of the Westwood house (Weatherbee Farm) became something of a cult classic because of an escalating dispute between the hosts, Vila and Abram, and the homeowners over the direction the project was taking. Vila remarked at the end of the Westwood series that the owners could have contributed more &quot;sweat equity&quot;. As the show evolved, it began to focus on higher end, luxury homes with more of the work done by expert contractors and tradespeople.

Vila left &quot;This Old House&quot; in 1989. For much of his time as host, Vila had taken on various commercial endorsements with the blessing of WGBH and his producer Russell Morash. Earlier in 1989, Vila had been approached by Supermarkets General Corporation, the owner of the Rickel chain of home improvement stores, to replace Bruce Morrow as the company&#x27;s television spokesman. Vila&#x27;s decision led to major underwriter and major competitor Home Depot, as well as its lumber supplier Weyerhauser, to respond by pulling support. Vila was not willing to stop working with Rickel, so Morash fired him from his position.

Steve Thomas took over hosting duties after Vila&#x27;s departure, remaining with the program until 2003. Cast members later complained that Vila took up too much screen time for himself, and noted that the show became more of an ensemble production after he left.

Since 2003, Kevin O&#x27;Connor has been the host of &quot;This Old House&quot;. Before O&#x27;Connor joined the cast, he was a homeowner who appeared on &quot;Ask This Old House&quot;, seeking help with wallpaper removal. During O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s tenure as host, Abram&#x27;s role increased to that of a near co-host. In at least a few season-opening episodes (in Cambridge, Carlisle, and Austin), Abram appeared alongside O&#x27;Connor to introduce the new project, and Abram also filled in for O&#x27;Connor when O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s son was born during the Carlisle project.

Beginning with the 2007–2008 season, &quot;This Old House&quot; and &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; are presented in a high-definition television format.

To celebrate its 30th anniversary season, &quot;This Old House&quot; worked with Nuestra Comunidad to renovate a foreclosed home in Boston&#x27;s Roxbury neighborhood. Nuestra Comunidad is a non-profit development corporation that acquired this 1870s era Second Empire style home from a bank foreclosure.


In 2016, Time Inc. sold &quot;This Old House&quot; to a joint venture operating as This Old House Ventures, LLC.

To celebrate the 40th season in 2019, a retrospective and revisit of some of the more-notable projects were incorporated into a handful of episodes, with some of the original homeowners providing tours. The first house highlighted was the original 1979 project house in Dorchester.

On March 19, 2021, TZP Growth Partners completed the sale of This Old House Ventures to Roku. All 1,500 episodes of &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; and &quot;This Old House&quot; will be made available to owners of Roku streaming products free with ads, and through their dedicated 24/7 Streaming TV channel. PBS will still have rights to air episodes on their platforms.

==&quot;Ask This Old House&quot;==

In 2002, Time Inc. created a spinoff of &quot;This Old House&quot; entitled Ask This Old House. The show was inspired by a similar feature in &quot;This Old House Magazine&quot;. It takes place in &quot;the loft&quot; of a rural barn somewhere in the Boston area. The regulars on the show have been Kevin O&#x27;Connor, Tom Silva, Richard Trethewey, and Roger Cook. Norm Abram does not appear on &quot;Ask This Old House&quot;. In later seasons, the spin-off program added landscape expert Jennifer Nawada Evans, eventually replacing Roger Cook, who retired due to unspecified health issues. Other experts making regular appearances include masonry specialist Mark McCullough, paint and finish specialist Mauro Henrique, and electricians Scott Caron and Heath Eastman. Ross Trethewey is the shows building engineer and leads the TV segment called &quot;Future House&quot;, covering home automation and related technology.

Magazine readers or show viewers submit home repair or improvement questions to the four regulars, who sometimes also invite guest experts to answer more-specialized questions. Most of the questions are answered in the home-base loft, but one or two homeowners in each episode receive an on-site visit from one of the show&#x27;s hosts. The visiting host assists in starting or completing the task with the homeowners&#x27; hands-on participation. Over the course of several seasons, at least one of the traveling team members has been featured in a segment in each of the 50 US states.

&quot;Ask This Old House&quot; had a program segment called &quot;What Is It?&quot;. In this segment, three of the four regulars would offer humorous guesses as to the function of an unusual tool or device, before the fourth regular would reveal its actual use. The segment was so popular that it would sometimes feature notable celebrity guests such as Jimmy Fallon, Nick Offerman, and Richard Mastracchio, the latter of whom broadcast from space. Beginning with the 2007–08 season, &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; added a &quot;Useful Tip&quot; segment provided by a viewer of the show; this is a revival of a short-lived feature of &quot;This Old House&quot; when Bob Vila hosted the show. Another occasional feature is &quot;Home Inspection Nightmares&quot;, in which viewer-submitted photographs of badly-made or deteriorated home installations are shown and commented on by the hosts.

The opening sequence of &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; consisted of a GMC van towing the dark-blue &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; trailer from around Massachusetts before reaching the barn at the end. The 25-second version of the opening sequence showed Tom Silva, as passenger, picking up four coffees from a drive-through. The original version had Steve Thomas as the driver. The 40-second version of the opening sequence showed Kevin O&#x27;Connor as the driver. In both versions, after the van pulls into the barn driveway, the footage cuts to Richard Trethewey handing out the coffees to the other three regulars. The original opening sequence has since been modified, and still shows the travels of the small trailer which has the &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; logo prominently displayed.

&quot;Ask This Old House&quot; has been nominated for five Emmy Awards.

==&quot;This Old House&quot; magazine==
&quot;This Old House&quot; magazine was first published in 1995 by Time Inc. and discontinued in 2024. Published eight times per year, the magazine had a circulation of over 950,000 and reached nearly 6 million consumers each month. Nathan Stamos was the publisher. , Susan Wyland, best known for her tenure on Time Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Real Simple&quot; magazine, became the magazine&#x27;s editor in chief, replacing Scott Omelianuk, who had been editor for 12 years.

ThisOldHouse.com is the brand&#x27;s website and features how-to projects and inspiration and tips for homeowners. The website also serves as the online destination for the television show and includes bios on the cast, information on all of the home projects, and live webcams of the current house projects.

==&quot;Inside This Old House&quot;==

A short-lived spin-off of the &quot;This Old House&quot; franchise, Inside This Old House, was shown primarily on the A&amp;E Network and originally aired from 2003 to 2004. The show was very much like &quot;Ask This Old House&quot;: it was shot mainly in the &quot;loft&quot;, was hosted by O&#x27;Connor, and featured the regular experts listed above and also Abram (master carpenter). However, unlike &quot;Ask This Old House&quot;, usually one or two experts were used throughout the episode and a specific theme was discussed. The theme was usually a particular topic (e.g., landscaping, installing doors, etc.). Along with the in-house expert, and sometimes a guest expert, clips were shown of past episodes of &quot;This Old House&quot; (mainly the original episodes with Bob Vila) to further illustrate the point as well as revisit past projects undertaken over the previous 25 years to see what the homeowners have done since airing. Each episode ended with a segment called &quot;Inside Out&quot;, which featured one of the two guest commentators, Jimmy Dunn and Doreen Vigue, and one of the experts, with a brief and comedic overview of what was discussed on the show.

==&quot;This Old House: Trade School&quot;==
In 2017, The CW network began airing a new spin-off, &quot;This Old House: Trade School&quot;. It is also hosted by Kevin O&#x27;Connor and is repurposed to meet E/I regulations for people 13 to 16 years old as part of the &quot;One Magnificent Morning&quot; program block. &quot;Trade School&quot; features the stars of &quot;This Old House&quot;, Norm Abram, Tom Silva, Richard Trethewey, and Roger Cook, showing what it is like to work alongside these seasoned pros.

The first host of &quot;This Old House&quot; was designer-builder and remodeling expert Bob Vila. He hosted the program from 1979 to 1989, when he left &quot;This Old House&quot; to become a spokesman for Sears Roebuck &amp; Company. From 1990 to 2005 he hosted the spinoff program &quot;Bob Vila&#x27;s Home Again&quot;, and from 2005 to 2007 he hosted &quot;Bob Vila&quot;.

For the original program, Vila was followed by Steve Thomas, who hosted from 1989 to 2003. In 2003, Thomas left the show and was replaced by current host Kevin O&#x27;Connor.

==In popular culture==

Like many successful programs, &quot;This Old House&quot; has found its way into the humorist&#x27;s eye on occasion. The most famous example is &quot;Tool Time&quot;, the &quot;show-within-a-show&quot; on the American television situation comedy &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. Tim Allen played Tim Taylor, a character inspired by Bob Vila, while Richard Karn portrayed Al Borland, a character based on Norm Abram. Bob Vila also guest-starred from time to time as Tim&#x27;s rival and archenemy. In one episode in 1994, Vila challenges Tim to a hot rod race and Tim tells Vila that he will kick Vila back to &quot;That Old House&quot;. When Vila tells Tim that he&#x27;s no longer on &quot;This Old House&quot; and that he started a new show called &quot;Home Again&quot;, Tim says he&#x27;ll kick Vila &quot;Home Again&quot;.

HBO&#x27;s &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; parodied &quot;This Old House&quot; as &quot;This Old Whore House&quot;, &quot;This Old House of Style&quot;, and &quot;This Old House Party&quot;. &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; parodied the show as &quot;This Old Brain&quot;, as well as &quot;This Old Climate&quot;; both featured Pat Cashman as Bob Liam. Nick at Nite&#x27;s &quot;On the Television&quot; parodied the show as &quot;This Old Backyard&quot;.

In 1985, PBS produced its own parody of &quot;This Old House&quot; titled &quot;This Old Shack&quot;, which featured &quot;Bob Villa&quot; and master carpenter &quot;Paul Thumbs&quot; in a three-part rehab in Arlington. In the seventh season of the second series of &quot;ZOOM&quot;, there was a parody of &quot;This Old House&quot; retitled as &quot;This Old Place&quot; wherein &quot;Abe Norman&quot; (a parody of Norm Abram), played by Kyle Morrow, would fix something (e.g., a washing machine) that would never function as it should. On one occasion, he put a gown in a washing machine and it came out as the shirt he was wearing currently.

The Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;The All New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; parodied the show as &quot;This Old Home&quot;, which featured renovations on the candy house from Hansel and Gretel. Fred Newman portrayed Bob Vilalalala (a parody of Bob Vila). In 1986, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; parodied &quot;This Old House&quot; as &quot;This House Needs Work with David Letterman&quot;, wherein Chris Elliott portrayed a head carpenter. In 2000, Blame Society Productions released a parody of &quot;This Old House&quot; titled &quot;My Old House with Bob Voila&quot;. &quot;Almost Live!&quot; parodied &quot;This Old House&quot; as &quot;This Here Place&quot;, which featured Pat Cashman as &quot;Bob Bobbin&quot;.

In 1988, John Larroquette portrayed Bob Vila on the NBC late-night sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in a parody of &quot;This Old House&quot; with homeowners Tom (Kevin Nealon) and Peggy McGuinness (Victoria Jackson) in which he rehabilitates an 1865 Victorian farmhouse to have load-bearing walls that sweat blood. Another SNL sketch shows Phil Hartman portraying a robot named XG-7000 who hosts a PBS show called &quot;Robot Repair&quot;, where he shows the viewers how to repair a variety of things, like a grandfather clock. However, the robot objects to the title, as it misleadingly implies that robots will be repaired, rather than doing the repairs, and he asks the producer to change it to clear things up. Over the next few weeks, the name is changed, first to &quot;Robot Repair and You&quot;, which solves nothing, then to &quot;Explaining Robots&quot; which again solves nothing, and later to &quot;Let&#x27;s Fix, Robots&quot; which proves to be even more misleading, much to XG-7000&#x27;s increasing frustration, and he&#x27;s now considering harming the producer. After the title is changed to &quot;This Old Robot&quot;, XG-7000 is finally pushed over the edge, presumably outraged from being called an &quot;Old Robot&quot; implied to be in need of repairs, and he storms off the set to kill the producer. The sketch would end with a FOX show called &quot;Fugitive Robots&quot;, (parody of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;), where an FBI agent (played by Jon Lovitz) remarked that XG-7000 was now wanted for the brutal murder of said producer, and he identified the show as &quot;Robot Restoration&quot; which apparently about how to fix robots. The skit ends with the text reading onscreen: &quot;Fugitive Robots, previously known as Robot Apprehension&quot;.

Fox&#x27;s long-running sketch comedy show &quot;Mad TV&quot; did a parody called &quot;This Cold House&quot;. Fox&#x27;s &quot;In Living Color&quot; parodied &quot;This Old House&quot; as &quot;This Ol&#x27; Box&quot;. Damon Wayans portrayed a homeless person named Anton Jackson, who talks about renovating a large cardboard box where he lived.

In the mid-1980s, a special on PBS station WTTW-Chicago starring Jim Belushi ostensibly showcasing three pilots for potential new programs featured Belushi as &quot;Bobby Viola,&quot; the host of a parody titled &quot;This Old Car.&quot;

<text>Group marriage or conjoint marriage is a marital arrangement where three or more adults enter into sexual, affective, romantic, or otherwise intimate short- or long-term partnerships, and share in any combination of finances, residences, care or kin work. Group marriage is considered a form of polygamy. While academic usage has traditionally treated group marriage as a marital arrangement, more recent usage has expanded the concept to allow for the inclusion of non-conjugal unions. Colloquial usage of group marriage has also been associated with polyamory and polyamorous families.

==Classification==
Depending on the sexual orientations of the individuals involved, all adults in the group marriage may be sexual partners of all others with whom they are compatible. For instance, if all members are heterosexual, all the women may have sexual relationships with all the men. If members are bisexual or pansexual, they may have evolved sexual relationships with either sex.

Group marriage implies a strong commitment to be &quot;faithful&quot; by having sex only within the group and intending to remain together for an extended period. The group may be open to taking on new partners, but only if all members of the family agree to accept the new person as a partner. The new person then moves into the household and becomes an equal member of the family.

The most common form of group marriage appears to be a triad of two women and one man, or less often two men and one woman.

==Legal aspects==
In most countries, it is not illegal for three or more people to form and share a sexual relationship (subject sometimes to laws against homosexuality), though such relational forms risk running afoul of state or local ordinances banning unmarried cohabitation. No Western country permits statutory marriage between more than two people. Nor do they give strong and equal legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners — the legal regime is not comparable to that applied to married couples. Individuals involved in polyamorous relationships are considered by the law to be no different from people who live together or date under other circumstances.

==Non-European cultures==
*Polygyny is most common in a region known as the &quot;polygamy belt&quot; in West Africa and Central Africa, with the countries estimated to have the highest polygamy prevalence in the world being Burkina Faso, Mali, Gambia, Niger and Nigeria. 
*Among the Ancient Hawaiians, the relationship of &quot;punalua&quot; involved &quot;the fact that two or more brothers with their wives, or two or more sisters with their husbands, were inclined to possess each other in common&quot;. Friedrich Ratzel in &quot;The History of Mankind&quot; reported in 1896 that in Hawaii a kind of incipient polyandry arose by the addition to the marriage establishment of a cicisbeo, known as Punalua.
*In some parts of Melanesia, there are &quot;sexual relations between a group of men formed by the husband&#x27;s brothers and a group of women formed by the wife&#x27;s sisters&quot;.
*Women of the Nair community, a caste in Kerala, India, used to practice polyandry.
*Toda people, who live on the isolated Nilgiri plateau of Southern India practiced adelphic polyandry for centuries, but no longer do so. Adelphic polyandry occurs when brothers share the same wife or wives. Such arrangements have been common in Himalayan tribes until recently.
* In Sri Lanka, Sinhalese people practiced adelphic polyandry in the past, but no longer it is common to do so. The main motive behind this is to protect the wealth undivided. If there were seven or fewer brothers in a family, younger brothers get access to the eldest brother&#x27;s wife. For families with more than seven brothers, the eighth brother will marry a new bride. Younger brothers get access to the eighth brother&#x27;s wife, but not the elder brothers. 
*Couple-to-couple marriages were made between the Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik until the early twentieth century when Christian missionaries suppressed the practice. Group marriage was not a standard of Yup&#x27;ik social order but rather a voluntary romantic arrangement between established couples.

The following instances are cited in Thomas 1906.
*In North America there is &quot;group marriage as existing among the Omahas ... adelphic polygyny.&quot;
*Among the Dieri of Australia exist forms of spouse-sharing known as &quot;pirrauru&quot;, in two categories &quot;according to whether or not the man has or has not a &quot;tippa-malku&quot; wife. In the first case it is, taken in combination with the &quot;tippa-malku&quot; marriage, a case of bilateral dissimilar adelphic (M. and F.) polygamy. In the latter case it is dissimilar adelphic (tribal) polyandry&quot;. The &quot;pirrauru&quot; &quot;relation arises through the exchange by brothers of their wives&quot;.
*Among the Kurnandaburi of Australia, &quot;a group of men who are own or tribal brothers are united ... in group marriage&quot;.
*Among the Wakelbura of Australia, there is &quot;adelphic polyandry.&quot;
*Among the Kurnai of Australia, &quot;unmarried men have access to their brothers&#x27; wives.&quot;

== In modern U.S. practices ==
Group marriage occasionally occurred in communal societies founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.

A long-lived example was the Oneida Community founded by John Humphrey Noyes in 1848. Noyes taught that he and his followers, having reached 200 in number, had thus undergone sanctification; that is, it was impossible for them to sin, and that for the sanctified, marriage (along with private property) was abolished as an expression of jealousy and exclusiveness. The Oneida commune lived together as a single large group and shared parental responsibilities. Any given male-female combination in the group was free to have sex, usually upon the man&#x27;s asking the woman, and this was the common practice for many years. The group began to falter about 1879–1881, eventually disbanding after Noyes fled arrest. Several dozen pairs of Oneidans quickly married in traditional fashion.

The Kerista Commune practiced group marriage in San Francisco from 1971 to 1991, calling their version polyfidelity.

It is difficult to estimate the number of people who actually practice group marriage in modern societies, as such a form of marriage is not officially recognized or permitted in any jurisdiction in the U.S., and &quot;de jure&quot; illegal in many. It is also not always visible when people sharing a residence consider themselves privately to be a group marriage.

== Portrayal in media ==
Group marriage appears in some of the novels of Robert A. Heinlein such as &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; (1961), &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (1966), &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; (1973), and &quot;Friday&quot; (1982). &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; describes a communal group much like the Oneida Society. Heinlein created specific types of group marriages for &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (line marriage) and &quot;Friday&quot; (S-groups).

In several of her Hainish Cycle stories (the cycle began in 1964) Ursula Le Guin describes a type of four-person marriage known as a sedoretu, practiced on the planet O. In this arrangement, a man and a woman from each of the two moiety are married to each other, but each member of the marriage only have sexual relationship with the male and the female spouse of the opposite moiety.

&quot;Proposition 31&quot; is a 1968 novel by Robert Rimmer that tells the story of two middle-class, suburban California couples who adopt a relationship structure of polyfidelity to deal with their multiple infidelities, as a rationalistic alternative to divorce. In the book, the solution to the couples&#x27; problems with adultery and the impregnation of one couple&#x27;s wife by the other couple&#x27;s husband is to commit to a group marriage to raise their five children in a home compound in which the husbands rotate among the wives.

Larry Constantine and his legal wife, at the time, Joan Constantine, researched and practiced group marriage in the 1970s. They created the Family Tree organization to promote healthy non-monogamous families, and collaboratively authored a book on the subject in 1974, &quot;Group Marriage: A Study of Contemporary Multilateral Marriage&quot; (Collier Books, 1974).

In James Alan Gardner&#x27;s book &quot;Vigilant&quot; (1999) the protagonist is part of a group marriage with multiple men and women involved.

In the 2010 television show &quot;Caprica&quot;, several main characters are portrayed as being in a polyfidelitous-style marriage consisting of multiple men and women, with each member being equal socially and legally. Such marriages co-exist along with monogamous marriages in the show&#x27;s civilization. When asked about this aspect of the series, co-creator Ronald D. Moore said &quot;In terms of polygamy, it&#x27;s usually framed in a &quot;Big Love&quot; context – it&#x27;s one man with many wives. I thought there was something even more intriguing about a true group marriage where all of the partners were married to one another. They have this much bigger definition of what a marriage was and I thought it was a fascinating cultural idea ...&quot;.

The fourth episode of the fourth season of the CBS television series, &quot;Elementary&quot;, an American procedural drama television series that presents a contemporary update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s character Sherlock Holmes, has a focus on group marriages. In the episode &quot;All My Exes Live in Essex&quot;, the victim of Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s latest case was a participant in a group marriage with two men, and was once in another group marriage with five other people.

In the novel series &quot;The Expanse&quot;, by James S. A. Corey, which began in 2011, a number of different group marriages are portrayed, such as one with main protagonist James Holden&#x27;s eight parents. Their marriage consists of one straight couple, one gay couple, and one polyamorous group of four. Their octet primarily exists to exploit a loophole in tax code allowing them to own twenty-two acres of farmland. Group marriages are also described as common on Mars and in the Asteroid Belt.

In the novel &quot;Europa Strike&quot; by Ian Douglas, one of the POV characters mentions a couple of non-traditional marriages, including three men, and one man with two women. These are off-handed mentions although they are an acknowledged part of the book&#x27;s universe, with the existence of non-traditional marriage practices having been mentioned in earlier books of the &quot;Heritage Trilogy&quot;.

<doc id="580448" wikidata="Q2508238" url="?curid=580448" title="Cape Hatteras Lighthouse">
<text>Cape Hatteras Light is a lighthouse located on Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks in the town of Buxton, North Carolina and is part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. It is the tallest lighthouse in the U.S. from base to tip at 210 feet. The lighthouse&#x27;s semi-unique pattern makes it easy to recognize and famous. It is often ranked high on lists of most beautiful, and famous lighthouses in the US.

The Outer Banks are a group of barrier islands on the North Carolina coast that separate the Atlantic Ocean from the coastal sounds and inlets. Atlantic currents in this area made for excellent travel for ships, except in the area of Diamond Shoals, just offshore at Cape Hatteras. Nearby, the warm Gulf Stream ocean current collides with the colder Labrador Current, creating ideal conditions for powerful ocean storms and sea swells. The large number of ships that ran aground because of these shifting sandbars gave this area the nickname &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic.&quot; It also led the U.S. Congress to authorize the construction of the Cape Hatteras Light. Its 198-foot height makes it the tallest brick lighthouse structure in the United States and 2nd in the world. Since its base is almost at sea level, it is only the 15th highest light in the United States, the first 14 being built on higher ground.

==Hatteras Island Visitor Center and Museum of the Sea==
Adjacent to the Cape Hatteras Light is the Hatteras Island Visitor Center and Museum of the Sea, operated by the National Park Service, which is located in the historic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Double Keepers&#x27; Quarters. Exhibits include the history, maritime heritage and natural history of the Outer Banks and the lighthouse. The visitor center offers information about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, ranger programs and a bookstore.

==History==

===Original lighthouse===
On July 10, 1794, after Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton requested that they make a lighthouse on this location after his ship almost crashed and sank on its to way to The New World giving it the nickname &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s light&quot; Congress appropriated $44,000 &quot;for erecting a lighthouse on the headland of Cape Hatteras and a lighted beacon on Shell Castle Island, in the harbor of Ocracoke in the State of North Carolina.&quot; The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was constructed in 1802.

The Cape Hatteras light marked very dangerous shoals that extend from the cape for a distance of . The original tower was built of dark sandstone and retained its natural color. The original light consisted of 18 lamps; with reflectors, and was above sea level. It was visible in clear weather for a distance of .

In July 1851, Lt. David D. Porter, USN, reported as follows:
The improvement in the light referred to had begun in 1845 when the reflectors were changed from 14 to . In 1848 the 18 lamps were changed to 15 lamps with reflectors and the light had become visible in clear weather at a distance of . In 1854 a first-order Fresnel lens with flashing white light was substituted for the old reflecting apparatus, and the tower was raised to .

In 1860 the Lighthouse Board reported that Cape Hatteras Lighthouse required protection, due to the outbreak of the Civil War. In 1862 the Board reported &quot;Cape Hatteras, lens and lantern destroyed, light reexhibited.

===Second lighthouse===
At the behest of mariners and officers of the U.S. Navy, Congress appropriated $80,000 to the United States Lighthouse Board to construct a new beacon at Cape Hatteras in 1868.

Completed in just under two years under the direction of brevet Brigadier General J. H. Simpson of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the new Cape Hatteras lighthouse cost $167,000. The new tower, from which the first-order light was first exhibited on December 16, 1871, was the tallest brick lighthouse tower in the world. It was above ground and the focal height of the light was above water. The old tower was demolished in February 1871, leaving ruins that lasted until finally eroded away in a storm in 1980.

In the spring of 1879 the tower was struck by lightning. Cracks subsequently appeared in the masonry walls, which were remedied by placing a metal rod to connect the iron work of the tower with an iron disk sunk in the ground. In 1912 the candlepower of the light was increased from 27,000 to 80,000.
Ever since the completion of the new tower in 1870, there had begun a very gradual encroachment of the sea upon the beach. This did not become serious, however, until 1919, when the high water line had advanced to about 120 ft (36.5) from the base of the tower. Since that time the surf gnawed steadily toward the base of the tower until 1935, when the site was finally reached by the surf. Several attempts were made to arrest this erosion, but dikes and breakwaters had been of no avail. In 1935, therefore, the tower light was replaced by an Aerobeacon atop a four-legged steel skeleton tower, placed farther back from the sea on a sand dune above the sea, visible for . The abandoned brick tower was then put in the custody of the National Park Service.

The Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration erected a series of wooden revetments which checked the wash that was carrying away the beach. In 1942, when German U-boats began attacking ships just offshore, the Coast Guard resumed its control over the brick tower and manned it as a lookout station until 1945. By then, due to accretion of sand on the beach, the brick tower was 500 to inland from the sea and again tenable as a site for the light, which was placed back in commission January 23, 1950.

The new light consisted of a aviation-type rotating beacon of 250,000 candlepower, visible , and flashing white every 7.5 seconds. The steel skeleton tower, known as the Buxton Woods Tower, was retained by the Coast Guard in the event that the brick tower again became endangered by erosion requiring that the light again be moved.

The light displays a highly visible black and white diagonal daymark paint scheme. It shares similar markings with the St. Augustine Light. Another lighthouse, with helical markings—red and white &#x27;candy cane &#x27;-- is the White Shoal Light (Michigan), which is the only true &#x27;barber pole&#x27; lighthouse in the United States. Its distinctive &quot;barber pole&quot; paint job is consistent with other North Carolina black-and-white lighthouses, &quot;each with their own pattern to help sailors identify lighthouses during daylight hours.&quot; 
Today the Coast Guard owns and operates the navigational equipment, while the National Park Service maintains the tower as a historic structure. The Hatteras Island Visitor Center, formerly the Double Keepers Quarters located next to the lighthouse, elaborates on the Cape Hatteras story and the lifestyle on the Outer Banks. Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, tallest in the United States, stands from the bottom of the foundation to the peak of the roof. To reach the light, which shines above mean high-water mark, requires climbing 268 steps. The construction order of 1,250,000 bricks was used in the construction of the lighthouse and principal keeper&#x27;s quarters. The light is still active. Up until 1970 the light was still using its First Order Fresnel lens. In 1970 it was replaced by an Aerobeacon. The light is used and maintained by the U.S Coast Guard as an Aid to Navigation, protecting Mariners from the icy depths of the Graveyard of the Atlantic. The active light can be seen from anywhere on Hatteras Island.

===Relocation===


In 1999, with the sea again encroaching, the Cape Hatteras lighthouse had to be moved from its original location at the edge of the ocean to safer ground. Due to erosion of the shore, the lighthouse was just from the water&#x27;s edge and was in imminent danger. The move was a total distance of to the southwest, placing the lighthouse from the current shoreline. All other support buildings at the site were also moved at the same time. All support buildings were placed back in positions that maintained their original compass orientations and distance/height relationship to the lighthouse. International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo, New York was awarded the contract to move the lighthouse, assisted by, among other contractors, Expert House Movers. The move was controversial at the time with speculation that the structure would not survive the move, resulting in lawsuits that were later dismissed. Despite some opposition, work progressed and the move was completed on September 14, 1999.

The Cape Hatteras Light House Station Relocation Project became known as &quot;The Move of the Millennium.&quot; General contractor International Chimney and Expert House Movers won the 40th Annual Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1999. The Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is one of the tallest masonry structures ever moved (200 feet tall and weighing 5,000 tons).

<text>The four sights are four events described in the legendary account of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s life which led to his realization of the impermanence and the ultimate dissatisfaction of conditioned existence. According to this legend, before these encounters Gautama Siddhartha had been confined to his palace by his father, who feared that he would become an ascetic if he came into contact with sufferings of life according to a prediction. However, his first venture out of the palace affected him deeply and made him realize the sufferings of all, and compelled him to begin his spiritual journey as a wandering ascetic, which eventually led to his enlightenment. The spiritual feeling of urgency experienced by Siddhārtha Gautama is referred to as saṃvega.

==The Legendary Account of the Four Sights==

===Background===
Siddhartha, belonged to the Kshatriya gana(clan) of the Sakya. He was born in Lumbini near Kapilavastu in Nepal. His father was the king of the Sakya clan. After the birth of his son, King Śuddhodana called upon eight Brahmins to predict his son&#x27;s future. While seven of them declared that the prince would either be a Buddha or a great king, the Brahmin Kaundinya was confident that he would renounce the world and become a Buddha.

Śuddhodana, who was determined that his son should be a great king, confined the prince within the palace and surrounded him with earthly pleasures and luxury, thereby concealing the realities of life that might encourage him to renounce these pleasures and become an ascetic.

===Observing the sights===

After leading a sheltered existence surrounded by luxury and pleasure in his younger years, Prince Siddhārtha ventured out of his palace for the first time at the age of 29. He set off from the palace to the city in a chariot, accompanied by his charioteer Channa (Sanskrit: Chandaka).

According to the more elaborated accounts such as the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot;, a Mahayana text originally in Sanskrit, probably from the 3rd century, the Four Sights were placed on his route by the gods, to encourage the development of Siddharta&#x27;s thinking. The 9th-century Borobudor reliefs illustrate this account.

==== 1st sight: senescence ====
On this journey he first saw an old man, revealing to Siddhārtha the consequences of aging. When the prince asked about this person, Channa replied that aging was something that happened to all beings alike.
==== 2nd sight: disease ====
The second sight was of a sick person suffering from a disease. Once again, the prince was surprised at the sight, and Channa explained that all beings are subject to disease and pain. This further troubled the mind of the prince.

==== 3rd sight: death ====
The third sight was of a dead body. As before, Channa explained to the prince that death is an inevitable fate that befalls everyone. After seeing these three sights, Siddhārtha was troubled in his mind and sorrowful about the sufferings that have to be endured in life.

==== 4th sight: asceticism ====
After seeing these three negative sights, Siddhārtha came upon the fourth sight, an ascetic who had devoted himself to finding the cause of human suffering. This sight gave him hope that he too might be released from the sufferings arising from being repeatedly reborn, and he resolved to follow the ascetic&#x27;s example.

===Aftermath===

After observing these four sights, Siddhārtha returned to the palace, where a performance of dancing girls was arranged for him. Throughout the performance, the prince kept on thinking about the sights. In the early hours of morning, he finally looked about him and saw the dancers asleep and in disarray. The sight of this drastic change strengthened his resolve to leave in search of an end to the suffering of beings.

Some time after this incident (the accounts differ considerably as to the timing) and realizing the true nature of life after observing the four sights, Siddhārtha left the palace on his horse Kanthaka accompanied only by Channa. This is known as the Great Departure. He sent Channa back with his possessions and began an ascetic life, at the end of which he attained enlightenment as Gautama Buddha. Before this, he saw a group of people meditating and he decided to join them. The leaders of this group thought him to be so good that they asked him to run their class. However, he thought that meditation was not the only factor on his path to enlightenment. He tried to discipline his body by fasting, but he realized that by doing this, he would die before he reached enlightenment.

In the early Pali suttas, the four sights as discrete encounters were not mentioned with respect to the historical Buddha Siddhārtha Gautama. Rather, Siddhārtha&#x27;s insights into old age, sickness and death were abstract considerations.

 Analogous passages for illness and death follow.

Similarly, the Ariya-pariyesana Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya 26) describes rather abstract considerations:
These passages also do not mention the fourth sight of the renunciant. The renunciant is a depiction of the Sramana movement, which was popular at the time of Siddhārtha and which he consequently joined. Over the next six years Siddhartha wandered from place to place, in search of the mystery of life and death. He sat under a peepal tree in Bodh Gaya and began to meditate. After many days of meditation he attained enlightenment and came to be known as Buddha or the &#x27;Enlightened One&#x27;. Buddha gave his first sermon at the Deer park in Sarnath. For the next forty-five years he spent his life travelling and preaching.He died at the age of eighty and by this time there were thousands of people who had started following Buddhism.

Buddha followed a simple path and inspired people to lead a simple life. His religious philosophy is called &#x27;Buddhism&#x27;. He preached in &#x27;Pali&#x27;- a language that everyone could understand. In the early Pali sources, the legendary account of the four sights is only described with respect to a previous legendary Buddha Vipassī (Mahāpadāna Sutta, DN 14).
In the later works Nidanakatha, Buddhavamsa and the Lalitavistara Sūtra, the account was consequently also applied to Siddhārtha Gautama.

===Different versions===
Some accounts say that the four sights were observed by Siddhārtha in one day, during a single journey. Others describe that the four sightings were observed by him on four occasions, or the three bad sights were seen in one trip, and the ascetic on another. Some versions of the story also say that the prince&#x27;s father had the route beautified and guarded to ensure that he does not see anything that might turn his thoughts towards suffering.

===Lesson learned===
After his ascetic experience, the Buddha chose the Middle Way.

<text>Alexander Romanovich Belyaev (, ; – 6 January 1942) was a Soviet Russian writer of science fiction. His works from the 1920s and 1930s made him a highly regarded figure in Russian science fiction, often referred to as &quot;Russia&#x27;s Jules Verne&quot;. Belyaev&#x27;s best known novel include &quot;Professor Dowell&#x27;s Head&quot;, &quot;Amphibian Man&quot;, &quot;Ariel&quot;, and &quot;The Air Seller&quot;.

==Biography ==

Alexander Belyaev was born in Smolensk in the family of an Orthodox priest. His father, after losing two other children (Alexander&#x27;s sister Nina died at childhood from sarcoma and his brother Vasiliy, a veterinary student, drowned during a boat trip), wanted him to continue the family tradition and enrolled Alexander into Smolensk seminary. Belyaev, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t feel particularly religious and even became an atheist in seminary. After graduating he didn&#x27;t take his vows and enrolled into a law school. While he studied law his father died and he had to support his mother and other family by giving lessons and writing for theater.

After graduating from the school in 1906 Belyaev became a practicing lawyer and made himself a good reputation. In that period his finances markedly improved, and he traveled around the world extensively as a vacation after each successful case. During that time he continued to write, albeit on small scale. Literature, however, proved increasingly appealing to him, and in 1914 he left law to concentrate on his literary pursuits. However, at the same time, at the age of 30, Alexander became ill with tuberculosis.

Treatment was unsuccessful; the infection spread to his spine and resulted in paralysis of the legs. Belyaev suffered constant pain and was paralysed for six years. His wife left him, not wanting to care for the paralyzed. In search for the right treatment he moved to Yalta together with his mother and old nanny. During his convalescence, he read the work of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and began to write poetry in his hospital bed.

By 1922 he had overcome the disease and tried to find occupation in Yalta. He served a brief stint as a police inspector, tried other odd jobs such as a librarian, but life remained difficult, and in 1923 he moved to Moscow where he started to practice law again, as a consultant for various Soviet organizations. At the same time Belyaev began his serious literary activity as writer of science fiction novels. In 1925 his first novel, &quot;Professor Dowell&#x27;s Head&quot; (Голова Профессора Доуэля) was published. From 1931 he lived in Leningrad with his wife and oldest daughter; his youngest daughter died of meningitis in 1930, aged six. In Leningrad he met H. G. Wells, who visited the USSR in 1934.

In the last years of his life Belyaev lived in the Leningrad suburb of Pushkin (formerly Tsarskoye Selo). At the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union during the Second World War he refused to evacuate because he was recovering after an operation that he had undergone a few months earlier.

==Death==
Belyaev died of starvation in the Soviet town of Pushkin in 1942 while it was occupied by the Nazis. The exact location of his grave is unknown. A memorial stone at the Kazanskoe cemetery in the town of Pushkin is placed on the mass grave where his body is assumed to be buried.

His wife and daughter survived and were registered as Volksdeutsche (Belyaev&#x27;s wife&#x27;s mother was of Swedish descent). Near the end of the war they were taken away to Poland by the Nazis. Due to this, after the war, Soviets treated them as collaborators: they were exiled to Barnaul (Western Siberia) and lived there for 11 years.

==Posthumous copyright dispute==
According to the Soviet copyright law in effect until 1964, Belyaev&#x27;s works entered the public domain 15 years after his death. In the post-Soviet era, Russia&#x27;s 1993 copyright law granted copyright protection for 50 years after the author&#x27;s death. With the adoption of Part IV of the Civil Code of Russia in 2004, copyright protection was extended to 70 years after the author&#x27;s death, and by an additional 4 years for authors who worked or fought during the Great Patriotic War. And a 2006 law stated that the Civil Code&#x27;s copyright protections described under articles 1281, 1318, 1327, and 1331 do not apply to works whose 50 year &quot;p.m.a.&quot; copyright term expired before the 1993 law came into force. All of this contributed to confusion about whether or not Belyaev&#x27;s works are protected by copyright, and for how long.

In 2008, Terra publishing company acquired exclusive rights to print Belyaev&#x27;s works from his heirs, and proceeded to sue Astrel and AST-Moskva publishing companies (both part of AST) for violating those exclusive rights. The Moscow arbitration court found in favor of Terra, awarding 7.5 billion rubles in damages and barring Astrel from distributing the &quot;illegally published&quot; works. An appellate court found that the awarded damages were calculated unjustifiably and dismissed them. On further appeal, a federal arbitration court found that Belyaev&#x27;s works entered the public domain on 1 January 1993, and could not enjoy copyright protection at all. In 2010, a Krasnodar cassation panel agreed that Belyaev&#x27;s works are in the public domain. Finally, in 2011 the High Court of Arbitration of Russia found that Belyaev&#x27;s works are protected by copyright until 1 January 2017 due to his activity during the Great Patriotic War, and remanded the case to lower courts for retrial. In 2012 the parties have come to a settlement.

<text>Scampi is a crustacean-based seafood dish, especially featuring langoustine (the Italian name of which gives the dish its name), as well as shrimp or prawns, varying regionally in preparation. The term &quot;scampi&quot; is also used as a style of preparation (of, characteristically, shellfish such as langoustines or shrimp sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and white wine, and garnished with Parmesan cheese and lemon juice).

==Name==
&quot;Scampi&quot; is the plural of , the Italian name for the langoustine (&quot;Nephrops norvegicus&quot;, also called the Norwegian lobster). The Italian word may be derived from the Greek (&quot;bending&quot; or &quot;winding&quot;). 

In English, the term may, depending on region and context, refer to either langoustine as a species, or to the dish traditionally made with them or a similar crustacean. In the United States, where langoustines are uncommon, the dish is made with shrimp, and usually called &quot;shrimp scampi&quot;, treating the terms as a style of preparation. Food labelling laws in the UK require products labelled &quot;scampi&quot; to contain langoustine (or, as &quot;Pacific scampi&quot;, Andaman lobster &quot;Metanephrops adamanicus&quot; or New Zealand lobster &quot;Metanephrops challengeri&quot;), as monkfish tail was formerly sometimes dishonestly used and sold as scampi in the United Kingdom.

==Preparation methods==
Although commonly sautéed, as in Italy, the French encyclopaedia &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; describes langoustine as delicate, and suggests they be poached only for a few seconds in court-bouillon. When very fresh, they have a slightly sweet flavour that is lost when frozen and can be eaten plain.

In Britain, the shelled tail meat is generally referred to as &quot;scampi tails&quot; or &quot;wholetail scampi&quot;. Cheaper &quot;re-formed scampi&quot; can contain other parts pressed together with other fish. Scampi is served fried in batter or breadcrumbs and usually with chips and tartar sauce. It is widely available in supermarkets and restaurants and considered pub or snack food.

In the United States, &quot;shrimp scampi&quot; is the menu name for a particular shrimp dish in Italian-American cuisine. (The actual word for &quot;shrimp&quot; in Italian is &quot;gambero&quot; or &quot;gamberetto&quot;, plural &quot;gamberi&quot; or &quot;gamberetti&quot;.) &quot;Scampi&quot; by itself is a dish of shrimp served in garlic butter, dry white wine and Parmesan cheese, either with bread or over pasta or rice. The term &quot;shrimp scampi&quot; is construed as a style of preparation, with variants using other shellfish or even meats such as chicken.

<text>Barak ( or ; ; Tiberian Hebrew: &quot;Bārāq&quot;; &quot;lightning&quot;) was a ruler of Ancient Israel. As military commander in the biblical Book of Judges, Barak, with Deborah, from the Tribe of Ephraim, the prophet and fourth Judge of pre-monarchic Israel, defeated the Canaanite armies led by Sisera.

==Background==
The son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, Barak&#x27;s mother was from the Tribe of Benjamin. His story is told in the Book of Judges, Chapters 4 and 5.

==Biblical story==
The story of the Hebrews&#x27; defeat of the Canaanites led by Sisera, under the prophetic leadership of Deborah and the military leadership of Barak, is related in prose (Judges Chapter 4) and repeated in poetry (Chapter 5, which is known as the &quot;Song of Deborah&quot;).

Chapter 4 makes the chief enemy Jabin, king of Hazor (present Tell el-Qedah, about three miles southwest of Hula Basin), though a prominent part is played by his commander-in-chief, Sisera of Harosheth-ha-goiim (possibly Tell el-&#x27;Amr, approximately northwest of Megiddo).

Deborah summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam, from his home at Kedesh in Naphtali, and ordered him, in the name of God, to take ten thousand men to Mount Tabor. He agreed to on condition that Deborah should go with him. Here he was attacked, as Deborah had expected, by Sisera, whose forces were put to flight, and the greater part of them were slain by Barak&#x27;s army.

Because Barak would not go to battle without Deborah, in turn she prophesied that the honor of victory would not go to him, but rather to a woman (Judges 4:9). Barak asked Deborah to go with him because of her connection with God. Some scholars see this as Barak being spineless while others might see Barak making a smart decision since Deborah was seen as a mediator between God and humans. Most authorities believe this passage refers to Jael&#x27;s killing of Sisera in her tent following the battle, while others believe this refers to Deborah herself.

==Defeat and death of Sisera==

In the battle at Mount Tabor, a cloudburst occurred, causing the river to flood, thus limiting the maneuverability of the Canaanite chariots. Sisera fled, seeking refuge in the tent of a Kenite woman, Jael. Jael gave a drink of milk to Sisera, who fell asleep from weariness, then killed him by pounding a tent peg through his head. When Barak arrived, she showed him Sisera, dead in her tent.

==Etymology==
Barak ברק means lightning in Hebrew. &quot;Barcas,&quot; the surname of the famous Hamilcar Barca, is the Punic equivalent of the name.

==In the New Testament==
The Epistle to the Hebrews 11:32-34 praises Barak&#x27;s faith which gave him victory.

==In the Apocrypha==
Barak is also made reference to in chapter 28 of 1 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Barak is also used in the Ethiopian language of Amharic. Meaning &quot; He who blesses.&quot;

<text>Francis Allen Doyle is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for the television series &quot;Angel&quot;. The character was portrayed by Glenn Quinn. Doyle is a seer who receives prophetic visions from The Powers That Be, usually of people in peril. Half-human, half-demon, his demon heritage allows him to manage them without suffering any permanent damage. His half-Brachen demon physiology grants him the ability to shift from normal human to demonic appearance, in which he has heightened sense of smell and superior strength, speed, stamina, and dexterity, the last of which allows him to twist his head around in such a manner as to fake a broken neck. However, Doyle rarely used his Brachen powers, preferring to remain human, thus limiting his usefulness in a fight.

==Character history==
Doyle is an Irishman who was born to a human mother and a Brachen demon father. Doyle never knew his father or anyone on that side of his family, and his own demonic genes didn&#x27;t physically manifest themselves until he was 21 years old. At that time, Doyle was a third grade teacher and a soup kitchen volunteer married to a woman named Harriet. He didn&#x27;t take the news of his demonic heritage very well. In spite of Harriet&#x27;s acceptance of his other side, his marriage ultimately disintegrated. Doyle hid behind the flimsy veneer of a ne&#x27;er-do-well hustler and con artist, seemingly more interested in where his next drink was coming from than helping others.

Later, he was approached by a fellow Brachen demon, Lucas, who told Doyle that the Scourge, a militant group of pure blood demons, was after all half-breeds and begged for Doyle&#x27;s help. Doyle turned Lucas away, believing this wasn&#x27;t his problem. Soon after he received a vision, which he described as &quot;splittin&#x27; migraines that come with pictures&quot;. The vision showed him a group of massacred Brachen demons. Doyle searched the city to find out if what he had seen was real – it was. These visions, which come from The Powers That Be, are what led Doyle to Angel. As Doyle says, &quot;We all got something to atone for,&quot; and therefore the two join forces to fight evil in Los Angeles. Once Cordelia Chase joins the team, Angel Investigations is officially formed.

Doyle soon falls in love with Cordelia, but is afraid she will reject him upon finding out about his demonic heritage, especially when she makes it clear on multiple occasions that she considers many demons evil. He also forms a close, brotherly bond with Angel as the result of their shared Irish heritage and similar demonic backgrounds, although his combat skills were limited due to his dislike of his demon half, which meant that he rarely transformed despite the greater strength he possessed in that form. Despite Doyle&#x27;s reluctance to discuss his past, Angel and Cordelia learn about him when Harriet returns to his life, wanting a divorce so she can marry an Ano-Movic demon named Richard Howard Straley, though she ultimately calls off the engagement after learning that obtaining the blessing of the Straley clan would require Richard to kill Doyle by eating his brain.

Doyle&#x27;s past again comes back to haunt him when the Scourge returns, threatening the Listers, another tribe of human/demon hybrids. During the battle, Doyle sacrifices his own life to save his friends, the Listers, and other nearby humans from the Beacon, a device which could destroy any being &quot;tainted&quot; with human blood within a quarter mile radius. While trying to successfully deactivate the Beacon, the radiation from the weapon killed Doyle by literally vaporizing his entire body into dust and ash. In doing so, Doyle fulfills the Listers&#x27; prophecy of the &quot;Promised One,&quot; the bringer purported to save them from the Scourge in the last days of the 20th century. Before Doyle dies, he shares a passionate kiss with Cordelia (who had only recently learned of – and accepted – Doyle&#x27;s demonic heritage). Unbeknownst to her, he was also passing his visions on to her.

After Doyle&#x27;s death, he briefly appears in the third-season episode &quot;Birthday&quot; and the fifth-season episode &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome,&quot; the former in a flashback and the latter courtesy of the Angel Investigations commercial he and Cordelia had made before he died, which Cordelia watches as she reflects on the team&#x27;s history. In &quot;Birthday&quot;, it is revealed that, in the alternate timeline that Cordelia has been sent to, Doyle passed his visions on to Angel before his death, and their power, along with the absence of Cordelia&#x27;s humanizing influence, drove him insane.

In the fifth season of &quot;Angel&quot;, Lindsey McDonald briefly assumes Doyle&#x27;s identity in an ultimately failed attempt to convince Angel and the others that Spike, not Angel, is the subject of the Shanshu Prophecy. Angel and Cordelia both display great anger at this abuse of Doyle&#x27;s name and legacy.

==Writing and acting==
Originally, it was Whistler, an ambiguous demon played by Max Perlich and first seen in the &quot;Buffy&quot; episode &quot;Becoming, Part One,&quot; who was to be a supporting character in the spin-off series starring Angel, but instead, the character of Doyle was created with similar character traits. Quinn was asked if he knew Doyle was Irish before he auditioned, he responded &quot;I went and I read it in American and Joss Whedon said &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s do it in Irish and see where it takes us.&#x27;.. The Irish thing just really clicked.&quot;

Whedon considered killing off Doyle early on from the opening episodes: &quot;That was always a plan, and clearly that character didn&#x27;t mesh. He was a very popular character, but the mesh was very difficult in ways that made it hard to write. Glenn had a kind of intensity that was kind of like David [Boreanaz&#x27;s], and David already has that. It could have gone a different way, but that was the plan we had and we decided to execute it. Glenn Quinn knew that it was an issue and he learned pretty early on. I said this is what we&#x27;re going to do...&#x27; and I promised him a hero&#x27;s exit.&quot; At the TCA Writers Guild of America West party in 2000, supervising producer David Fury stated, &quot;Joss has bandied about, &#x27;I love the idea of putting a character in the main credits as one of the stars of the show and then kill him right off the bat.&#x27; But in the case of Doyle, he didn&#x27;t want to kill off Doyle. It just became a situation. The work situation became difficult... It&#x27;s hard enough to make a television show without the headaches.&quot;

In an interview in &quot;Dreamwatch&quot; #118, David Fury discussed plans for Doyle to return to the show, perhaps in the role of a &quot;big bad.&quot; However, Quinn died in December 2002 before anything could come of the talks.

==Appearances==

===Canonical appearances===
In &quot;Angel&quot;, Doyle was a series regular for part of the show&#x27;s first season (1999). He appeared in nine episodes overall. After the events of &quot;Parting Gifts&quot;, he disappeared from the opening credits.

Archived footage of the character appears in the episodes, &quot;Birthday&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot;.

===Non-canonical appearances===

;Comics
In July 2006, IDW Comics released &quot;&quot;. It features Doyle shortly before his first encounter with Angel.

Doyle is also a main character in the following comics (ordered by chronology):
* &quot;Surrogates&quot;, &quot;Earthly Possessions&quot;, &quot;Angel #4&quot;, &quot;Hunting Ground&quot;

;Novels
Doyle is a main character in the following novels (ordered by chronology):
* &quot;Not Forgotten&quot;, &quot;Close to the Ground&quot;, &quot;Soul Trade&quot;, &quot;Redemption&quot;, &quot;Shakedown&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Noir&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Bruja&quot;, and &quot;The Summoned&quot;

The Buffy/Angel crossover book, &quot;Monster Island&quot;, set in the third season of &quot;Angel&quot; also includes a story linked to Doyle and his father, who is a pure-blood supremacist who wanted to purge Doyle of his human half. Having learned of his son&#x27;s death, Doyle&#x27;s father – a full Brachen demon called Axtius, possessing sufficient strength to even go head-to-head with Angel in a fight – sends several demons to attack Harry, sending her to the hospital, and subsequently attempts to kill Angel, blaming him for his son&#x27;s &#x27;foolish attempt to save a pack of pitiful half-breeds&#x27;. In their final confrontation, Angel defeats Axtius when unarmed despite Axtius wielding a powerful mystical weapon, taunting the Brachen by saying that he would have been ashamed of Doyle&#x27;s very human act of sacrifice and redemption, Axtius subsequently being incinerated by his former second-in-command for his failure.

<text>The Norland was a P&amp;O roll-on/roll-off ferry operating between Kingston upon Hull in Yorkshire, UK, and Rotterdam Europoort, Netherlands, and then Zeebrugge, Belgium. The 27,000 tonne ferry was built in 1974 by AG Weser, Bremerhaven, for Dutch North Sea Ferries partners Noordzee Veerdiensten N.V. Sistership sailed under Dutch flag and &quot;Norland&quot; under British flag and with (mainly) British crew. The ship transferred to P&amp;O North Sea Ferries in 1996.

==Falklands Service==
During the Falklands War, the Ministry of Defence requisitioned the &quot;Norland&quot; to be used as a troopship in the Task Force sent to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentina. &quot;Norland&quot; was among the ships to enter San Carlos Water during the amphibious landings of Commandos and Paratroopers, Captained by Donald Ellerby CBE. The ship survived attack from the Argentine Air Force, and at the end of the war repatriated the defeated Argentine troops back home, alongside the &quot;Canberra&quot;. For this service &quot;Norland&quot; received the battle honour &quot;Falkland Islands 1982,&quot; which for many years was displayed in one of the passenger lounges, with a painting of the ship in San Carlos Water.

==Post P&amp;O==
In 2002, the &quot;Norland&quot; was sold to SNAV as the &quot;SNAV Sicilia&quot; for service between Naples and Palermo.

The ship was broken up in India in the summer of 2010.

==Popular culture==
She was seen in the BBC TV Only Fools and Horses episode To Hull and Back, when the Trotter family used her as a means of navigation.

<text>Cameron &quot;Cam&quot; Jackson (born February 27, 1951) is a Canadian politician. A Progressive Conservative, he was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1985, and held the office of Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Burlington until his resignation on September 28, 2006 to run for mayor of Burlington in the 2006 election. He served as mayor from 2006 to 2010 when he was defeated by Rick Goldring.

==Background==
Jackson was born in Hamilton, Ontario. His mother was Ukrainian Canadian. He was educated at McMaster University, although he left before graduating to take a job with the Ontario Conservative Party. Before entering politics, he was the Chief Executive Officer of the Metropolitan Hamilton Real Estate Board, and also worked for the Halton Housing Authority from 1975 to 1980. In 1996, he was named &quot;Officer Brother of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem&quot; by Canada&#x27;s Governor-General. He also served as a trustee on the Halton Public School Board for ten years.

==Provincial politics==
Jackson was elected for the riding of Burlington South in the provincial election of 1985, defeating Liberal candidate Doug Redfearn by about 4,500 votes. He was a backbench supporter of the government of Frank Miller, which was defeated in the legislature shortly after the election. In late 1985, Jackson supported Alan Pope&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to replace Miller as party leader.

Jackson was nearly defeated in the provincial election of 1987, defeating Liberal Bill Priestner by 605 votes. He won by a much greater margin in the 1990 election. The Tories finished in third place in both instances, behind the Liberals and the New Democratic Party.

The Progressive Conservatives returned to power in the 1995 provincial election, and Jackson was re-elected in Burlington South with over 70% of the popular vote. He was made a Minister without Portfolio in the government of Mike Harris on June 26, 1995, with responsibility for the Workers Compensation Board. After a shuffle on August 16, 1996, he was given ministerial responsibility for Seniors. He was finally given a full portfolio on July 27, 1998, being made Ontario Minister of Long-Term Care and Seniors. Jackson was easily re-elected in the 1999 provincial election for the redistributed riding of Burlington.

On June 17, 1999, he was named Minister of Tourism. He was named Minister of Citizenship with responsibility for Seniors on February 8, 2001, but returned to the Tourism portfolio (now retitled Tourism and Recreation) when Ernie Eves succeeded Mike Harris as Premier on April 15, 2002. He was forced to resign on October 2, 2002 due to a controversy over his practice of billing the government for steak dinners and hotel stays. Jackson did not appear in public for weeks and there was speculation that he would not run for re-election. Jackson was fully exonerated of all allegations before the next election, and did retain his riding in the 2003 election (albeit with a greatly reduced majority) while dozens of other Tory MPPs lost their seats.

There had been speculation that Jackson would run to succeed Eves in the 2004 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election but in July, Jackson endorsed John Tory&#x27;s candidacy for the position of party leader.

===Cabinet positions===


==Mayor of Burlington==
On September 28, 2006, Jackson announced both his retirement from provincial politics and his candidacy for Mayor of Burlington. He was elected in the 2006 municipal election, succeeding Rob MacIsaac. After just one term in office, he was defeated in the 2010 municipal election by Rick Goldring.

<doc id="580494" wikidata="Q373952" url="?curid=580494" title="Backlink">
<text>From the point of view of a given web resource (referent), a backlink is a regular hyperlink on another web resource (the referrer) that points to the referent. A &quot;web resource&quot; may be (for example) a website, web page, or web directory.

A backlink is a reference comparable to a citation. The quantity, quality, and relevance of backlinks for a web page are among the factors that search engines like Google evaluate in order to estimate how important the page is. PageRank calculates the score for each web page based on how all the web pages are connected among themselves, and is one of the variables that Google Search uses to determine how high a web page should go in search results. This weighting of backlinks is analogous to citation analysis of books, scholarly papers, and academic journals. A Topical PageRank has been researched and implemented as well, which gives more weight to backlinks coming from the page of a same topic as a target page.

Some other words for &quot;backlink&quot; are incoming link, inbound link, inlink, inward link, and citation.

==Wikis==
Backlinks are offered in Wikis, but usually only within the bounds of the Wiki itself and enabled by the database backend. MediaWiki specifically offers the &quot;&quot; tool, some older Wikis, especially the first WikiWikiWeb, had the backlink functionality exposed in the page title.

== Backlinks and search engines ==
Search engines often use the number of backlinks that a website has as one of the most important factors for determining that website&#x27;s search engine ranking, popularity and importance. Google&#x27;s description of its PageRank system (January 1998), for instance, noted that &quot;Google interprets a link from page A to page B as a vote, by page A, for page B.&quot; Knowledge of this form of search engine rankings has fueled a portion of the search engine optimization (SEO) industry commonly termed linkspam, where a company attempts to place as many inbound links as possible to their site regardless of the context of the originating site. In January 2017, Google launched Penguin 4 update which devalued such link spam practices.

The significance of search engine rankings is high, and it is regarded as a crucial parameter in online business and the conversion rate of visitors to any website, particularly when it comes to online shopping. Blog commenting, guest blogging, article submission, press release distribution, social media engagements, and forum posting can be used to increase backlinks.

Websites often employ SEO techniques to increase the number of backlinks pointing to their website. Some methods are free for use by everyone whereas some methods, like linkbaiting, require quite a bit of planning and marketing to work. There are also paid techniques to increase the number of backlinks to a target site. For example, private blog networks can be used to purchase backlinks. It has been estimated that the average cost of buying a link in 2019 was $291.55 and $391.55, when marketing blogs were excluded from the calculation.

There are several factors that determine the value of a backlink. Backlinks from authoritative sites on a given topic are highly valuable. If both sites and pages have content geared toward the topic, the backlink is considered relevant and believed to have strong influence on the search engine rankings of the web page granted the backlink. A backlink represents a favorable &#x27;editorial vote&#x27; for the receiving webpage from another granting webpage. Another important factor is the anchor text of the backlink. Anchor text is the descriptive labeling of the hyperlink as it appears on a web page. Search engine bots (i.e., spiders, crawlers, etc.) examine the anchor text to evaluate how relevant it is to the content on a webpage. Backlinks can be generated by submissions, such as directory submissions, forum submission, social bookmarking, business listing, blog submissions, etc. Anchor text and webpage content congruency are highly weighted in search engine results page (SERP) rankings of a webpage with respect to any given keyword query by a search engine user.

Changes to the algorithms that produce search engine rankings can place a heightened focus on relevance to a particular topic. While some backlinks might be from sources containing highly valuable metrics, they could also be unrelated to the consumer&#x27;s query or interest. An example of this would be a link from a popular shoe blog (with valuable metrics) to a site selling vintage pencil sharpeners. While the link appears valuable, it provides little to the consumer in terms of relevance.

<text>The Buffyverse or Slayerverse is a media franchise centered on the supernatural drama television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, created by Joss Whedon. The term also refers to the shared fictional universe in which the TV series are set. Originally coined by fans of the series, it has since been used in the titles of published works, and adopted by Whedon. 

The &quot;Buffyverse&quot; is a setting in which supernatural phenomena exist, and supernatural evil can be challenged by people willing to fight against such forces. The franchise includes novels, comics, video games, and other media. Much of the licensed &quot;Buffyverse&quot; merchandise and media, while released officially, is not considered to be canon within the universe.

==Construction==
The &quot;Buffyverse&quot; is a fictional construct created by hundreds of individual stories told through TV, novels, comics and other media. It began with the first episodes of the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; television series in 1997 and expanded with the spinoff TV series &quot;Angel&quot; in 1999. The popularity of these series led to licensed fiction carrying the &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; labels.

Outside of the TV series, the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; has been expanded and elaborated by various authors and artists in the so-called &quot;&quot;Buffyverse&quot; Expanded Universe&quot;. The &quot;Buffyverse&quot; novels, &quot;Buffy&quot; video games and the vast majority of &quot;Buffyverse&quot; comics, are licensed by 20th Century Fox. The works sometimes flesh out background information on characters. For example, &quot;Go Ask Malice&quot; provides information about the origins of the character Faith Lehane.

The &quot;Buffyverse&quot; comics were first published by Dark Horse, who have retained the right to produce &quot;Buffy&quot; comics. IDW now hold the license to produce &quot;Angel&quot; comics. Joss Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics entitled &quot;Fray&quot;, about a futuristic vampire slayer. Its final issue was published in August 2003. Pocket Books holds the license to produce &quot;Buffy&quot; novels, but their license to produce &quot;Angel&quot; novels expired in 2004.

== Characteristics ==
The &quot;Buffyverse&quot; is distinguishable from the real world in that it contains and engages with supernatural elements, although only a small proportion of the human population is aware of these phenomena in canon. In regards to its presentation of morality, many elements of the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; are introduced as being either good or evil, and they are usually linearly handled as such. However, certain instances in the plot call fall under and are handled as more ambiguous or grey areas. A few of the main aspects of the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; are as follows.

=== The Old Ones ===

The world of the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; was originally ruled by powerful pure-bred demons: the Old Ones. However, the Old Ones were eventually driven out of the earth&#x27;s dimension. Any who remained were then vanquished or imprisoned in the &quot;Deeper Well&quot;, which manifests as a hole through the earth, with one opening hidden within a tree in England. These demons are revered and worshiped by lesser demon species. They await their chance to return and reclaim Earth.

=== Vampires ===
According to legend in the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, the last Old One to leave this dimension fed off a human, and in the process, their blood mixed. The human&#x27;s body was left without a soul, and a demon took its place. Rupert Giles details that the resulting creature &quot;bit another, and another, and so they walk the Earth&quot;, creating what became known as Vampires. Some elements of traditional vampire mythology are used in the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, while others are abandoned. The elements, rules, and customs held by Buffyverse vampires are as follows.

Killing Methods
*Wooden stake through the heart
*Extensive exposure to sunlight (other dimensions&#x27; stars may not work the same as Earth&#x27;s, as Pylea&#x27;s dual suns did not kill Angel)
*Extensive burning by fire
*Decapitation
*Holy water (ingestion)
*Magical and supernatural devices and spells

Vulnerabilities
*Exposure to holy water
*Physical contact with a cross
*Limited exposure to sunlight
*Limited exposure to fire
*Possession by other supernatural creatures and forces
*Supernatural spells and devices

Features
*Cannot enter private dwellings unless invited.
*Vampires&#x27; bodies and clothes explode to dust when slain (except for articles of importance, such as magical rings, amulets, etc.)
*Have no reflection (however, they do have a shadow and can appear in photos)
*Superhuman strength, endurance, speed, and senses
*Have no soul (unless it is in some way restored such as with Angel and later Spike)
*Cannot have children (unless foretold by prophecy, such as Angel and Darla&#x27;s son, Connor)
*Bullets cannot kill vampires, but can cause them extreme pain.
*In the first episode, garlic is seen in Buffy&#x27;s trunk along with stakes, crosses, and holy water. It is also used by Buffy in &quot;Wrecked&quot; to repel Spike. Also, in the episode &quot;The Wish&quot;, which explored an episode where Buffy Summers never came to Sunnydale, and vampires ruled the city, garlic is seen lining the lockers of Sunnydale High. 
*In that same episode, &quot;The Wish&quot;, it was alluded that bright colors attract vampires, and therein the townspeople wear dark, muted colors.
*They can be tranquilized.
*Can become intoxicated by consuming alcohol or the blood of a human who is intoxicated with drugs. This fact&#x27;s first application can be attributed to Spike within season two. He claims that after he drank from a hippie at Woodstock, he spent &quot;the next six hours watching [his] hand move&quot;. This fact is consistent with season four of Angel, wherein Faith becomes high on the drug orpheus and allows Angelus to feed on her, causing him to react to the drug as well.

=== Werewolves ===
As within historical werewolf mythology, werewolves are people who suffer from lycanthropy. In the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, werewolf characters are shown to have an &quot;animal side&quot; which either complements or clashes with their &quot;human side&quot;. They transform on the full moon of each month, as well as on the day before and the day after. Some werewolves have shown the ability to gain control/achieve harmony between their human and bestial sides (such as Oz and his teacher in the comics). Prominent werewolf characters include Oz, Veruca, and Nina Ash.

===Demons===
In the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, the term &quot;demon&quot; is inexact; it has been applied to just about every creature that is not a god, robot, unmodified human, or standard terrestrial animal. Some classes of creature, such as Vampires and Old Ones, are commonly known as &quot;demons&quot; but are not always referred to as such.

Portrayed within the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, there are many kinds of demons of many differing natures and origins. Some demons are shown to live and reproduce on Earth (the Bezoar in &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;), but others are extraterrestrial (the Queller demon in &quot;Listening to Fear&quot;), extradimensional (Lorne on &quot;Angel&quot;), ex-humans (Anya Jenkins was a peasant who became a vengeance demon), and even hybrids (Cordelia Chase had aspects of demon fused in her). Some species of demon are capable of breeding with humans (Doyle has a human mother and a demon father). Anya Jenkins states in the episode &quot;Graduation Day&quot; that the demons that walk the earth are not pure demons, they are half-breeds. She states that true demons are &quot;bigger&quot;, in reference to Mayor Richard Wilkins&#x27; Ascension into a true demon.

Many demons in &quot;Buffy&quot; are shown to be inherently evil and solely interested in causing suffering, death, and harm. Other characters challenge this notion however, with demons such as Clem and Lorne who appear to be basically good.

=== Slayers ===
In the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, long ago, a group of shamans once used the essence of a demon to produce the First Slayer. She was banished from her own village and forced to fight the forces of darkness alone. When she died, another girl was &quot;chosen&quot; in her place. The line of Slayers is maintained over the years until Buffy&#x27;s two deaths and revivals cause a disturbance that ultimately leads to the awakening of the First Evil.

The Slayer is given great strength, lightning reflexes, fast healing powers and is naturally highly skilled with many weapons and martial arts.

=== Watchers ===
Within the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, the Watchers&#x27; Council historically exists to offer guidance to the Slayer; assisting them by supervising their training and by researching existing and possible demonic or supernatural threats. Notable Watchers include Rupert Giles, Watcher of series protagonist Buffy, and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, who takes over temporarily in season 3.

=== &quot;The Good Fight&quot; ===
While most of humanity in the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; seems oblivious to the existence of demons, there exists other groups and organizations battling against evil, and these factions come to light over the course of &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; and in related media. For example, a group of socially disadvantaged youth in L.A. organized to battle the vampires destroying their community (See Charles Gunn). And, although some of their methods and goals proved questionable, a government-funded group known as The Initiative was also long aware of the existence of demons and was revealed to be fighting a secret war against them. Other large-scale groups appear in both &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;, often as antagonists to the heroes due to differing views on how to, as they say, fight the good fight.

=== Magic ===
Magic in the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; can be used for all manner of control. Spells can be performed by anyone by use of magical items and the invocation of particular words. Witches and warlocks, however, have considerably more knowledge and power to use it for their purposes than the average person.

A witch can inherit their lineage from their parents or develop their craft over many years, and neither a witch nor warlock must necessarily be human, such as Cyvus Vail.

=== Humans with Powers ===
While not prominent in the &quot;Buffyverse&quot;, there are select few individuals who gain special powers through means other than those mentioned above. Gwen Raiden and Bethany (from the &quot;Angel&quot; episode &quot;Untouched&quot;) both seem to have been born with their powers. Drusilla had psychic powers as a human before becoming a vampire, though their origins are never explained. Others, like Marcie Ross from the episode &quot;Out of Mind, Out of Sight&quot; or the trio of Nerds, gain their powers by other magical, non-magical, or &quot;scientific&quot; means. Connor is also a human with supernatural powers, similar to those of vampires, because he was born as a product of two vampire parents.

=== Technology ===
Technology in the &quot;Buffyverse&quot; is more advanced than in the real world at the time it was produced, although the applications of such technologies do not seem to be common knowledge. Examples of advanced technology include:

* The demon Moloch has an advanced robotic body built for him to inhabit. (&quot;I, Robot... You, Jane&quot;)
* Inventor Ted Buchanan built a highly advanced android version of himself in the 1950s that was capable of impersonating a human being without drawing suspicion. (&quot;Ted&quot;)
* Warren Mears builds a lifelike android named April as a companion in the episode &quot;I Was Made to Love You&quot;, then builds the Buffybot for Spike as well as an android version of himself. He later forms and leads the Trio as their technology guru. The trio is later shown to use a freeze ray (&quot;Smashed&quot;), an invisibility ray (&quot;Gone&quot;), a Cerebral Dampener capable of removing someone&#x27;s free will (&quot;Dead Things&quot;), and jet packs (&quot;Seeing Red&quot;).
* Pete Clarner is shown to create a chemical compound that gives him highly enhanced strength (&quot;Beauty and the Beasts&quot;).

Additionally, there is much technology specifically geared towards use both by and against the supernatural, used by the government organization known as &quot;The Initiative&quot; and the demonic law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart.

=== Multiverse ===
A &quot;Buffy&quot; multiverse is established in season 3 of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; episodes &quot;The Wish&quot; and &quot;Doppelgangland&quot;, and then referred to in subsequent series of &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and their comic book continuations. Some comic book continuations following the &quot;Buffy&quot; TV show, notably those published by BOOM! Studios, have used the existence of the multiverse as part of their premise, as well as a story device within the series.

The multiverse is set within a wider cosmology of &quot;hell dimensions&quot; inhabited mainly or primarily by demons, whose existence drives the plot of &quot;Buffy&quot; season five, some of which are also visited in episodes of &quot;Angel&quot;.

<text>Siaka Probyn Stevens (24 August 1905 – 29 May 1988) was the leader of Sierra Leone from 1967 to 1985, serving as Prime Minister from 1967 to 1971 and as President from 1971 to 1985. Stevens&#x27; leadership was often characterized by patrimonial rule, violence, and self-indulgence, consolidating power by means of corruption and exploitation.

Stevens and his All People&#x27;s Congress (APC) party won the closely contested 1967 Sierra Leone general elections over incumbent Prime Minister Sir Albert Margai of the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP). In April 1971, Stevens made Sierra Leone a republic and became president a day after the constitution had been ratified by the Sierra Leone Parliament. Though generally considered as the first president of Sierra Leone, technically he was the second President of the Republic after Christopher Okoro Cole, a judge, who was sworn in for a day after which he resigned, paving the way for Stevens.

Stevens served as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1 July 1980 to 24 June 1981, and pioneered the creation of the Mano River Union, a three-country economic union comprising Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea.

Stevens retired from office at the end of his term on 28 November 1985. After pressuring all other potential successors to step aside, he chose Major-General Joseph Saidu Momoh, the commander of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, as his successor. He died on 29 May 1988, in Freetown.
He got seen as a &quot;Pragmatic Socialist&quot;

==Early life==
Siaka Probyn Stevens was born on 24 August 1905 in Moyamba, Moyamba District in the Southern Province of British Sierra Leone to a Limba father and a Mende mother. His maternal mother Miatta Massaquoi is the daughter of Siaka Massaquoi who was a king of the Vai people (also: &quot;Gallinas&quot;), whose settlement area is now partly in Sierra Leone and partly in Liberia . He is considered the founder of the modern ruling house of the Massaquoi and the kingdom of the Gallinas (1814), which was the only one in Africa to have a crown designed after the European model.

Although born in Moyamba, Stevens was largely raised in Freetown. Stevens completed his primary education in Freetown and completed secondary school at Albert Academy in Freetown, before joining the Sierra Leone Police Force. From 1923 to 1930, he rose to the rank of First Class Sergeant and Musketry Instructor.

From 1931 to 1946, Stevens worked on the construction of the Sierra Leone Development Company (DELCO) railway, linking the Port of Pepel with the iron ore mines at Marampa. In 1943, he helped co-founded the United Mine Workers Union and was appointed to the Protectorate Assembly in 1946 to represent worker interests. In 1947, Stevens was enrolled at Ruskin College where he studied labour relations.

==Political career==

In 1951, Stevens co-founded the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) and was elected to the Legislative Council. A year later, he became Sierra Leone&#x27;s first Minister of Mines, Lands, and Labor. In 1957, he was elected to the House of Representatives as a member for Port Loko constituency, but lost his seat as a result of an election petition. APC was founded in 1963–64 when he visited East Germany, with Sheku Magona and Kade Kamara, with Kade Kamara going to China to getting the seed money for the start of the party.

After disagreements with the SLPP leadership, Stevens broke ties with the party and co-founded the People&#x27;s National Party (PNP), of which he was the first secretary-general and deputy leader. In 1959, he participated in independence talks in London. When the talks concluded, however, he was the only delegate who refused to sign the agreement on the grounds that there had been a secret defence pact between Sierra Leone and the United Kingdom. Another point of contention was the Sierra Leonean government&#x27;s position that there would be no elections held before independence, which would effectively shut him out of the political process. He was promptly expelled from the PNP upon his return from the talks. Stevens then launched the Elections Before Independence Movement (EBIM).

After successfully exploiting the disenchantment of northern and eastern ethnic groups with the SLPP, along with the creation of an alliance with the Sierra Leone Progressive Independence Movement (SLPIM), He was one of the 8TH member&#x27;s of the APC after it was formed on 20 March 1960.

==Interrupted premiership==
The All People&#x27;s Congress is one of the two major political parties in Sierra Leone, the other being the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP). The party was founded in 1960 by a breakaway group from the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party who vehemently opposed the idea of an election before independence, but instead supported the idea of independence before elections. The All People&#x27;s Congress (APC) was formed at 5 Elba Street, Freetown, and it consisted of the late Alhaji Chief Mucktarru Kallay, the party&#x27;s first chairman and Leader and who gave the name and the symbol. Allieu Badarr Koroma, the deputy chairman, C.A. Kamara-Taylor, First Secretary General, Alhaji Sheik Gibril Sesay, Treasurer, Kawusu Konte, Organiser, S. A. T. Koroma, Public Relations, Kotor AbuBakarr Sam Bangura, The Artist who drew the Symbol, were the first seventh and later added six to thirteen members. These were the first seven and founders members of the All Peoples Congress. The next Members are Siaka Probyn Stevens, Nancy Steele, S.I.Koroma, Bob Allen, Mohamed Bash-Taqui and Ibrahim Bash-Taqui. Sir Albert Margai who would later return to the SLPP and become prime minister, and Siaka P. Stevens, who would also later become prime minister and subsequently President of Sierra Leone. The APC governed the country from 1968 to 1992, and became the ruling party again in 2007, after the party presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma won the 2007 Sierra Leonean presidential election.

In elections held on 17 March 1967, the APC won by an extremely narrow margin, and Stevens was appointed prime minister, but he was arrested only half an hour after taking office during a military coup led by Brigadier David Lansana.

After a brief period of military rule, Stevens reassumed the post of prime minister on 26 April 1968. In April 1971, a republican constitution was introduced. It was ratified by the House of Representatives on 20 April. Due to the complex process of ending the monarchy, Chief Justice Christopher Okoro Cole became interim governor general in late March. When the republic was formally inaugurated on 19 April, Cole became president for two days. He then resigned, and Stevens became president, with wide executive and legislative powers.

==Presidency==
In 1973, the first elections under the new constitution were held. The polls were marred by violence and were boycotted by the SLPP, which gave the APC all 85 seats in the House of Representatives. In March 1976 Stevens was re-elected President unopposed by the House. Stevens&#x27;s first vice-president from 1971 until leaving office in 1985 was Sorie Ibrahim Koroma.

Throughout the remainder of the 1970s, Stevens continued to consolidate his power, which culminated in a 1978 referendum on a new constitution that would create a one-party state with the APC as the only legally permitted party. Stevens billed the proposed one-party system as more African than Western-style democracy. However, the country had been a &quot;de facto&quot; one-party state since Sierra Leone became a republic. On 12 June, 97.1% of voters were reported to have voted for the new one-party constitution, an implausibly high total that could have only been obtained by massive fraud. Observers agreed that the elections had been heavily manipulated by the government. Proving this, even areas where the SLPP was still dominant were reported as supporting the one-party state by landslide margins.

Following the election, all opposition members of the House of Representatives were required to join Stevens&#x27;s APC or lose their seats. Two years after being re-elected for a five-year term, Stevens was sworn in for an additional term of seven years, having by then adopted the title of &quot;Dr.&quot; He also became known as &quot;Pa Shaki&quot;.

President Stevens served as Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) from 1 July 1980 to 24 June 1981, and engineered the creation of the Mano River Union, a three country economic federation of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. Stevens held additional office of Minister of Finance from December 1981 to early 1982.

Stevens&#x27; regime was very repressive and corrupt, even by African standards of the time. Many of his opponents, some of which were once close associates, were imprisoned and killed. The Internal Security Unit, a gang of unemployed urban youths amply supplied with drugs, was deployed as Stevens&#x27; personal death squad. He had actually shown a deep authoritarian streak long before making Sierra Leone an official one-party state; the late 1960s and early 1970s saw frequent states of emergency and numerous executions of political foes.

Among his close associates sent to the gallows were John Amadu Bangura, who had once plucked Stevens from political oblivion when the army obliterated civilian politics after the 1967 Huha elections; at that time, Stevens had been down and out, living in exile in Conakry, Guinea, with his main remaining option, a planned assault on the sovereignty of Sierra Leone and her citizens. Bangura was to be the ring leader, but the plan never materialised because of a coup headed by Bangura. Bangura, in turn, handed over power to Siaka Stevens as prime minister (Kpana:2005).

Another prominent Sierre Leonean murdered during Stevens&#x27; rule was Dr Mohamed Forna. He was hanged along with 14 other people in 1974 after trumped-up charges of treason. Dr Forna was the popular finance minister when Stevens came to power. 

Stevens also grossly mismanaged the economy. He and his closest colleagues looted state resources, to the point that the state was unable to supply basic services. The education system was more or less non-existent. The poverty was especially pronounced in rural areas, which were largely isolated from Freetown. Although he had retired by the time of the Sierra Leone Civil War in 1991, the impact of his political, social, and economic policies directly contributed to that conflict.

===Foreign policy===
Siaka Stevens reached out to communist countries such as North Korea, Cuba and China upon taking office. This led western leaders to initially be wary of him. However, he was also a committed Anglophile, who believed that &quot;old friends were the best.&quot; As a result of this, he took a staunchly pro-British approach to numerous foreign policy issues, including voting with Britain at the UN with regards to positions on Spain&#x27;s claim to Gibraltar and on issues regarding Northern Ireland. Stevens stated that Spain had no legitimate claim to Gibraltar and he had Sierra Leone&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations vote accordingly. Stevens oversaw Sierra Leone&#x27;s transition from a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Sierra Leone, to a republican form of government with no monarchy. However, he was &quot;outspokenly pro-British&quot; the entire time, and was not motivated by any form of animosity towards Great Britain or the royal family. Despite forming ties with communist nations that were opposed to NATO and the west, Stevens said that outside of Africa, the United Kingdom would remain Sierra Leone&#x27;s best and truest friend. He said he was proud of Britain&#x27;s role in Sierra Leone&#x27;s history which he believed was mostly positive. He outlined &quot;football, rugby, cricket, boxing, trial by jury, habeas corpus and parliamentary democracy&quot; as all being things Sierra Leone inherited from Britain that he was fond of. Stevens also said he was proud of having attended Ruskin College. His middle name was &quot;Probyn&quot; after the British governor Leslie Probyn, who governed Sierra Leone from 1904 to 1910. He said &quot;the injustices and racialism of the colonial regime in Sierra Leone helped to make me an African nationalist. I do not say this in any spirit of hostility to the British I knew in the old days, many of whom I admired, even loved. They were doing a difficult job which they had chosen as a nation but not in every case as individuals. They were locked into a system of values and prejudices they had acquired from backgrounds and circumstances, which were an inescapable part of history. I apportion no blame.&quot;

==Retirement==
Stevens retired from office at the end of his term on 28 November 1985. After pressuring all other potential successors to step aside, Major-General Joseph Saidu Momoh was sworn in as the new president of the Republic. Stevens died on 29 May 1988 in Freetown.

Partly due to Stevens&#x27; authoritarian excesses, Sierra Leone&#x27;s current constitution limits the president to two five-year terms, even if they are nonsuccessive.

<text>Las Anod (; ) is the administrative capital of the Sool region, currently controlled by Khatumo State forces aligned with Somalia.

==Territorial dispute==
The city is disputed by Puntland and Somaliland. The former bases its claim due to the kinship ties between the Dhulbahante clan and the dominant clan in Puntland, the Majeerteen, whilst the latter&#x27;s claim is grounded on the border of the former British Somaliland Protectorate. The city was the proclaimed capital of Khatumo State throughout its existence until its dissolvement in 2017.

Somaliland forces captured the city in the Battle of Las Anod in 2007, ousting Puntland forces, and has maintained full control of the city in all aspects since. Until now Somaliland governs Las Anod with little legitimacy or popularity, while regular unknown assassinations have deteriorated the security situation.

Ahmed Musa reports, the residents of Las Anod have not fully accepted Somaliland&#x27;s presence in their city:

Somaliland still governs Lasanod with little legitimacy or popularity. This is one reason why Somaliland has to be flexible with respect to tax collection. It cannot impose the full tax code on the Dhulbahante territories because that would only reinforce local people’s existing grievances vis-à-vis Somaliland. Therefore, Somaliland’s reduced taxes (cashuur dhaaf) in the Lasanod areas are one way of garnering, or at least retaining, some level of public acceptance.

===2023 conflict and changes in possession===

Sparked by anti-government protests, war broke out again in February 2023 between Somaliland and Khatumo State forces. On August 25, 2023, Khatumo State forces achieved a decisive victory, successfully driving Somaliland forces out of Las Anod. As the Khatumo State is supported by the Somali government, Las Anod has effectively come under the control of Somalia.

==History==

===Pre-independence===
On 31 July 1903, a battle occurred between 30 British scouts and 128 Dervish scouts, a few miles west of Heli Madu near Las Anod:

 &quot;half way between Las Anod and Heli Madu ... they were the advanced scouts of a party of 128 of the Mullah&#x27;s scouts, mostly spearmen ... the enemy emerged from thick bush. They fought for two hours, the enemy losing many men killed and wounded, the exact number not being known; the enemy dragged their wounded and dead away.

The motive for this Dervish development was said by Roman Loimeier as caused by how the Dhulbahante had not signed colonial protective treaties (since the Italians considered part of the Dhulbahante as subjects of the Italian-protected Sultan of the Majeerteen), combined with the fear, agitation and anxiety from contemporaneous yearly expedition-raids by marauding Menelik II armies and their pillaging.

During the British protectorate era, Las Anod was the capital of the Nogal District, the precursor province of Sool, described by John Hunt as an &quot;entirely Dolbahanta&quot; province.

===Post-independence===
The United Somali Party was founded in Las Anod with the intention of forming a non-Isaaq axis, due to tensions deriving from the instability in 1954 and 1955. The instability of 1954 was primarily due to camel-rustling between Dhulbahante and Habar Jeclo, whilst that of 1955 was due to roaming resulting from droughts that culminated into a war with Dhulbahante on one side battling the two Isaaq clans of Habr Yunis and Habar Jeclo on the other:

On the 27th of October the District Commissioner Las Anod, completed the hearing of an enquiry into previous unrest in the region... One of those killed was a man of the Habar Yuunis Sa&#x27;ad Yuunis who were fighting with the Habar Ja&#x27;lo against the Ḍulbahante, and the other a man of the MaḤammad Abokor.

From 1959 until 1961, Las Anod was the seat of Garad Ali&#x27;s USP party. With Las Anod as its seat, Garad Ali&#x27;s USP party formed a coalition consisting of the Warsangeli, Gadabuursi and Dhulbahante clans. In the previous six years, Ali&#x27;s father Garad Farah, was in self-induced exile in Mogadishu:

Ali Gerad Jama, the university – educated son of the Gerad ( chief ) Jama Farah ( who went into voluntary exile in Mogadiscio from 1952 to 1958 as a result of his conflict with the British administration ) provided the main drive behind the party.

On October 15, 1969, whilst paying a visit to the city, Somali President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d&#x27;état on October 21, 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Military seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.

Initially, there was cordiality between the SYL party (Somali Youth League) and the northern Harti-dominated USP party; for instance the parties held joint conferences across Somalia and together expressed support for Somalia&#x27;s new constitution in 1960. However, post independence, Las Anod has had a history of suspicion of centralized politics, including against the unitary and Somali nationalist platform of the Somali Youth League (SYL). For example, in the 1960s, five SYL officials were killed within the city. Towards the end of the decade 16 people were once against killed when the SYL party supporters staged in the city.

Throughout the 21st century, Las Anod has been described as the only city in the Horn of Africa wherein the population&#x27;s dignitaries are regularly assassinated without a culprit, suspect or defendant being named, including the extolled influencer Cabdirisaaq Cardoofe, assassinated in 2021.

===Recent history===
In December 2022, a Las Anod politician was assassinated leading to violent confrontations and the death of 20 protesters. The President of Somaliland announced that the cause of the incident must be identified. President Puntland accused Somaliland of carrying out attacks against civilians. The Somaliland government accused Puntland of spreading misinformation to incite violence in Las Anod.

In early January 2023 Somaliland&#x27;s Minister of Interior Mohamed Kahin Ahmed sat down with traditional elders and intellectuals from Las Anod to discuss the current situation in the city, where protests against the frequent assassinations in Las Anod are taking place.

On January 31, the Somaliland government warned the country&#x27;s media outlets against spreading news, reports, and polls that could worsen the situation in Las Anod that &quot;everyone working in Somaliland is obligated to follow the laws of the country, first and foremost the Somaliland Constitution.&quot;
On February 6, the first asylum seekers arrived in Ethiopia.

On February 6, a committee composed of town leaders and traditional elders appointed to deliberate on the political future of the region attempted to publicly announce its intention to reject Somaliland and form a Federal Republic of Somalia under the name SSC-Khaatumo. However, Somaliland troops camped outside Las Anodos shelled the town and disrupted the announcement.
On February 8, Las Anod mayor Abdirahim Ali Ismail stated that &quot;this is not a war between Somaliland and Puntland, nor between Somaliland and terrorists, but between the Somaliland army and the people of Las Anod.&quot;
On February 14, the Djiboutian government denied rumors of Djibouti&#x27;s involvement in the fighting in Las Anod following unconfirmed reports on social media against Djibouti regarding the situation in Las Anod.
On February 16, the BBC announced that the Las Anod rebel group had formed a cultural council; the BBC listed the key figures as Garad Jama Garad Ali, Garaad Cabdullaahi Garaad Saleebaan Garaad Maxamed, Garad Jama Garad Ismail Duale, Garaad Cabdirisaaq Garaad Soofe Durraan.
Somaliland finance company Dahabshiil announces it will provide $200,000 to help displaced people in Las Anod.

Nicholas Delaunay, director of the International Crisis Group&#x27;s East and Southern Africa Project, said Somaliland has provided no concrete evidence of Al-Shabaab&#x27;s involvement and that deeper issues behind the conflict must be addressed quickly.

On February 23, United Nations Human Rights Council reported that more than 185,000 people, 89% of them women and children, have been displaced by the fighting in Las Anod that began on February 6.

On February 25, a Somaliland military spokesman said, &quot;Hostile forces with al-Shabaab background broke the ceasefire agreement and attacked Somaliland forces. The attack was repulsed and much of the city remains under the control of Somaliland forces.&quot;

On February 26, Somaliland&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Essa Kayd, announced the final withdrawal of troops from the front lines in Las Anod to designated military units in order to minimize civilian impact.

He also said that al-Shabaab was behind the disturbances and that they chose Las Anod as a place of refuge because they were driven out of central Somalia.

On February 28, a major hospital was hit by four mortar rounds, killing at least one person and wounding several others. Somaliland&#x27;s Ministry of Defense denied that the military shelled the hospital and said such reports were &quot;fake news&quot; intended to damage the military&#x27;s reputation.

Since March 1, no major fighting has occurred and life has resumed peacefully. However, the devastation is evident, and there are major obstacles such as the roads to Burco and Bosaso, the source of supplies in peacetime.

On March 2, the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Somalia said, &quot;In 1988, the Somali government launched a war against the civilian population. It is unfortunate that the same scenario is being repeated now,&quot; he said.

On March 8, Somaliland military commander Nuh Ismail Tani announced in a media interview, &quot;We have the right and the ability to retake Las Anod, but we are abiding by the government ceasefire agreement.&quot;

On March 9, the Somaliland government said that among the fighters fighting Somaliland forces in Las Anod were troops from Ethiopia&#x27;s Somali regional government. The Ethiopian government denies it.

On August 25, 2023, Khatumo State forces achieved a decisive victory, successfully driving Somaliland forces out of Las Anod.

== Politics ==

Las Anod is the centre of political power of the Dhulbahante clan. As of 2021, Las Anod constituents are represented by 12 members parliament representing Sool elected in the Somaliland parliamentary elections. With nominal participation in the Somaliland elections, a mere 5 representatives hail from the Dhulbahante which almost exclusively inhabit the Sool region. From the 2005 parliamentary elections onwards, the Isaaq clans in Aynaba District have benefited disproportionally from the absence of this community. Hoehne explains:

Additionally, residents are represented by 13 local councillors elected in the Somaliland municipal elections.

In the 2021 parliamentary and municipal elections about 100,000 residents registered to vote across the Sool region with a thin majority registering in the capital Las Anod. This was a dismal voter turnout as the acceptance of Somaliland’s presence in the eastern regions remains uneven. The Crisis Group reports:

Abdirisak Khalif who hails from Las Anod was also selected as the speaker of Somaliland&#x27;s house of representatives in the same year.

==Geography==
Las Anod is strategically positioned in the Nugaal Valley and along the trade routes in Somaliland and Puntland. The city is almost surrounded by hills and has considerable water resources, the latter of which makes it a prime destination for peoples from other parts of generally arid regions within Somaliland as well as from neighboring countries such as Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia .

==Economy==
Evictions carried out in 2021 were reportedly due to business rivalries between locals and residents from South West State of Somalia. According to a recent research report, the Berbera and Bosaso ports are the main sources of commodities that arrive in Las Anod: 
==Demographics==
According to the UNFPA 2014 population estimate the Las Anod District has an estimated population of 156,438 inhabitants.

The city is primarily inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, in particular by the Dhulbahante sub-clan of the Harti Darod. The &quot;gaashaanbuur&quot; subclan of &quot;Shiikhyaale&quot; especially well represented. The Fiqishini (Hawiye) which at times form part of Baho Nugaaled are also present in Las Anod.

In the 1950s, Ioan Lewis described the lineage cleavage running through the city as follows:

== Education ==
Las Anod has numerous primary schools which include both private and public. Currently there are 6 Primary Schools in the city of Las Anod; Gol Khatumo, Gateway, Abyan, Ilays, Imam Shafi and Sool primary schools.

Secondary school education is provided by Ilays Educational Academy, Muse Yusuf and Nugaal High Schools. Founded in 2004, Nugaal University (NU) is the first post-secondary institution of higher learning to be established in the area. The first group of four-year Nugaal University students graduated in September 2009. Also there are Ilays National University and Gollis University both established in Las Anod in 2015.

There are also a number of academic institutions in Las Anod which provide diverse education services such as Sool Institute of Heath Sciences (SIHS), Al-Furqan Islamic Institute, Sahal Software College, Future Technology Center etc.

<text>Tubulin in molecular biology can refer either to the tubulin protein superfamily of globular proteins, or one of the member proteins of that superfamily. α- and β-tubulins polymerize into microtubules, a major component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. It was discovered and named by Hideo Mōri in 1968. Microtubules function in many essential cellular processes, including mitosis. Tubulin-binding drugs kill cancerous cells by inhibiting microtubule dynamics, which are required for DNA segregation and therefore cell division.

In eukaryotes, there are six members of the tubulin superfamily, although not all are present in all species. Both α and β tubulins have a mass of around 50 kDa and are thus in a similar range compared to actin (with a mass of ~42 kDa). In contrast, tubulin polymers (microtubules) tend to be much bigger than actin filaments due to their cylindrical nature.

Tubulin was long thought to be specific to eukaryotes. More recently, however, several prokaryotic proteins have been shown to be related to tubulin.

== Characterization ==

Tubulin is characterized by the evolutionarily conserved Tubulin/FtsZ family, GTPase protein domain.

This GTPase protein domain is found in all eukaryotic tubulin chains, as well as the bacterial protein TubZ, the archaeal protein CetZ, and the FtsZ protein family widespread in bacteria and archaea.

== Function ==
===Microtubules===

α- and β-tubulin polymerize into dynamic microtubules. In eukaryotes, microtubules are major components of the cytoskeleton, and function in many processes, including structural support, intracellular transport, and DNA segregation. 

Microtubules are assembled from dimers of α- and β-tubulin. These subunits are slightly acidic, with an isoelectric point between 5.2 and 5.8. Each has a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa.

To form microtubules, the dimers of α- and β-tubulin bind to GTP and assemble onto the (+) ends of microtubules while in the GTP-bound state. The β-tubulin subunit is exposed on the plus end of the microtubule, while the α-tubulin subunit is exposed on the minus end. After the dimer is incorporated into the microtubule, the molecule of GTP bound to the β-tubulin subunit eventually hydrolyzes into GDP through inter-dimer contacts along the microtubule protofilament. The GTP molecule bound to the α-tubulin subunit is not hydrolyzed during the whole process. Whether the β-tubulin member of the tubulin dimer is bound to GTP or GDP influences the stability of the dimer in the microtubule. Dimers bound to GTP tend to assemble into microtubules, while dimers bound to GDP tend to fall apart; thus, this GTP cycle is essential for the dynamic instability of the microtubule.

==== Bacterial microtubules ====
Homologs of α- and β-tubulin have been identified in the &quot;Prosthecobacter&quot; genus of bacteria. They are designated BtubA and BtubB to identify them as bacterial tubulins. Both exhibit homology to both α- and β-tubulin. While structurally highly similar to eukaryotic tubulins, they have several unique features, including chaperone-free folding and weak dimerization. Cryogenic electron microscopy showed that BtubA/B forms microtubules &quot;in vivo&quot;, and suggested that these microtubules comprise only five protofilaments, in contrast to eukaryotic microtubules, which usually contain 13. Subsequent &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have shown that BtubA/B forms four-stranded &#x27;mini-microtubules&#x27;.

=== DNA segregation ===
=== Cell division ===
==== Prokaryotic division ====
FtsZ is found in nearly all Bacteria and Archaea, where it functions in cell division, localizing to a ring in the middle of the dividing cell and recruiting other components of the divisome, the group of proteins that together constrict the cell envelope to pinch off the cell, yielding two daughter cells. FtsZ can polymerize into tubes, sheets, and rings &quot;in vitro&quot;, and forms dynamic filaments &quot;in vivo&quot;.

TubZ functions in segregating low copy-number plasmids during bacterial cell division. The protein forms a structure unusual for a tubulin homolog; two helical filaments wrap around one another. This may reflect an optimal structure for this role since the unrelated plasmid-partitioning protein ParM exhibits a similar structure.

=== Cell shape ===
CetZ functions in cell shape changes in pleomorphic Haloarchaea. In &quot;Haloferax volcanii&quot;, CetZ forms dynamic cytoskeletal structures required for differentiation from a plate-shaped cell form into a rod-shaped form that exhibits swimming motility.

== Types ==

=== Eukaryotic ===
The tubulin superfamily contains six families (alpha-(α), beta-(β), gamma-(γ), delta-(δ), epsilon-(ε), and zeta-(ζ) tubulins).

==== α-Tubulin ====

Human α-tubulin subtypes include:

* TUBA1A
* TUBA1B
* TUBA1C
* TUBA3C
* TUBA3D
* TUBA3E
* TUBA4A
* TUBA8
==== β-Tubulin ====
All drugs that are known to bind to human tubulin bind to β-tubulin. These include paclitaxel, colchicine, and the &quot;vinca&quot; alkaloids, each of which have a distinct binding site on β-tubulin.

In addition, several anti-worm drugs preferentially target the colchicine site of β-Tubulin in worm rather than in higher eukaryotes. While mebendazole still retains some binding affinity to human and &quot;Drosophila&quot; β-tubulin, albendazole almost exclusively binds to the β-tubulin of worms and other lower eukaryotes.

Class III β-tubulin is a microtubule element expressed exclusively in neurons, and is a popular identifier specific for neurons in nervous tissue. It binds colchicine much more slowly than other isotypes of β-tubulin.

β1-tubulin, sometimes called class VI β-tubulin, is the most divergent at the amino acid sequence level. It is expressed exclusively in megakaryocytes and platelets in humans and appears to play an important role in the formation of platelets. When class VI β-tubulin were expressed in mammalian cells, they cause disruption of microtubule network, microtubule fragment formation, and can ultimately cause marginal-band like structures present in megakaryocytes and platelets.

Katanin is a protein complex that severs microtubules at β-tubulin subunits, and is necessary for rapid microtubule transport in neurons and in higher plants.

Human β-tubulins subtypes include:

* TUBB
* TUBB1
* TUBB2A
* TUBB2B
* TUBB2C
* TUBB3
* TUBB4
* TUBB4Q
* TUBB6
* TUBB8
==== γ-Tubulin ====
γ-Tubulin, another member of the tubulin family, is important in the nucleation and polar orientation of microtubules. It is found primarily in centrosomes and spindle pole bodies, since these are the areas of most abundant microtubule nucleation. In these organelles, several γ-tubulin and other protein molecules are found in complexes known as γ-tubulin ring complexes (γ-TuRCs), which chemically mimic the (+) end of a microtubule and thus allow microtubules to bind. γ-tubulin also has been isolated as a dimer and as a part of a γ-tubulin small complex (γTuSC), intermediate in size between the dimer and the γTuRC. γ-tubulin is the best understood mechanism of microtubule nucleation, but certain studies have indicated that certain cells may be able to adapt to its absence, as indicated by mutation and RNAi studies that have inhibited its correct expression. Besides forming a γ-TuRC to nucleate and organize microtubules, γ-tubulin can polymerize into filaments that assemble into bundles and meshworks.

Human γ-tubulin subtypes include:
* TUBG1
* TUBG2

Members of the γ-tubulin ring complex:

* TUBGCP2
* TUBGCP3
* TUBGCP4
* TUBGCP5
* TUBGCP6
==== δ and ε-Tubulin====

Delta (δ) and epsilon (ε) tubulin have been found to localize at centrioles and may play a role in centriole structure and function, though neither is as well-studied as the α- and β- forms.

Human δ- and ε-tubulin genes include:
* δ-tubulin: TUBD1
* ε-tubulin: TUBE1

====ζ-Tubulin====

Zeta-tubulin () is present in many eukaryotes, but missing from others, including placental mammals. It has been shown to be associated with the basal foot structure of centrioles in multiciliated epithelial cells.

=== Prokaryotic ===

==== BtubA/B ====
BtubA () and BtubB () are found in some bacterial species in the Verrucomicrobiota genus &quot;Prosthecobacter&quot;. Their evolutionary relationship to eukaryotic tubulins is unclear, although they may have descended from a eukaryotic lineage by lateral gene transfer. Compared to other bacterial homologs, they are much more similar to eukaryotic tubulins. In an assembled structure, BtubB acts like α-tubulin and BtubA acts like β-tubulin.

==== FtsZ ====
Many bacterial and euryarchaeotal cells use FtsZ to divide via binary fission. All chloroplasts and some mitochondria, both organelles derived from endosymbiosis of bacteria, also use FtsZ. It was the first prokaryotic cytoskeletal protein identified.

==== TubZ ====
TubZ (; pBt156) was identified in &quot;Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; as essential for plasmid maintenance. It binds to a DNA-binding protein called TubR (; pBt157) to pull the plasmid around.

==== CetZ ====
CetZ () is found in the euryarchaeal clades of &quot;Methanomicrobia&quot; and &quot;Halobacteria&quot;, where it functions in cell shape differentiation.

==== Phage tubulins ====
Phages of the genus &quot;Phikzlikevirus&quot;, as well as a &quot;Serratia&quot; phage PCH45, use a shell protein () to build a nucleus-like structure called the phage nucleus. This structure encloses DNA as well as replication and transcription machinery. It protects phage DNA from host defenses like restriction enzymes and type I CRISPR-Cas systems. A spindle-forming tubulin, variously named &quot;PhuZ&quot; () and &quot;gp187&quot;, centers the nucleus in the cell.

==== Odinarchaeota tubulin ====
&quot;Asgard archaea&quot; tubulin from hydrothermal-living Odinarchaeota (OdinTubulin) was identified as a genuine tubulin. OdinTubulin forms protomers and protofilaments most similar to eukaryotic microtubules, yet assembles into ring systems more similar to &quot;FtsZ&quot;, indicating that OdinTubulin may represent an evolution intermediate between FtsZ and microtubule-forming tubulins.

== Pharmacology ==
Tubulins are targets for anticancer drugs such as vinblastine and vincristine, and paclitaxel. The anti-worm drugs mebendazole and albendazole as well as the anti-gout agent colchicine bind to tubulin and inhibit microtubule formation. While the former ultimately lead to cell death in worms, the latter arrests neutrophil motility and decreases inflammation in humans. The anti-fungal drug griseofulvin targets microtubule formation and has applications in cancer treatment.

== Post-translational modifications ==
When incorporated into microtubules, tubulin accumulates a number of post-translational modifications, many of which are unique to these proteins. These modifications include detyrosination, acetylation, polyglutamylation, polyglycylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and palmitoylation. Tubulin is also prone to oxidative modification and aggregation during, for example, acute cellular injury.

Nowadays there are many scientific investigations of the acetylation done in some microtubules, specially the one by α-tubulin N-acetyltransferase (ATAT1) which is being demonstrated to play an important role in many biological and molecular functions and, therefore, it is also associated with many human diseases, specially neurological diseases.

<doc id="580517" wikidata="Q653302" url="?curid=580517" title="Katy Lied">
<text>Katy Lied is the fourth studio album by American rock band Steely Dan, released in March 1975, by ABC Records; reissues have since been released by MCA Records due to ABC&#x27;s acquisition by the former in 1979. It was the first album the group made after they stopped touring, as well as their first to feature backing vocals by Michael McDonald.

In the United States, the album peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart, and it has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The single &quot;Black Friday&quot; charted at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Recording==
The album was the first one recorded by Steely Dan after guitarist Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter and drummer Jim Hodder left the group as a result of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen&#x27;s decision to stop touring and focus solely on recording with various studio musicians. Guitarist Denny Dias, a founding member of Steely Dan, contributed to the album as a session musician, as did vocalist Michael McDonald and drummer Jeff Porcaro, who were both members of Steely Dan&#x27;s final touring band. Then only 20 years old, Porcaro played drums on every track on the album except &quot;Any World (That I&#x27;m Welcome To)&quot;, which features session drummer Hal Blaine. Larry Carlton, who became a regular collaborator of the group, made his first appearance on a Steely Dan album playing guitar on &quot;Daddy Don&#x27;t Live in That New York City No More&quot;.

Band leaders Becker and Fagen said they were dissatisfied with the album&#x27;s sound quality because of an equipment malfunction with the then-new dbx noise reduction system. The damage was mostly repaired after consulting with the engineers at dbx, but Becker and Fagen still refused to listen to the completed album.

The album was remastered in UHQR (ultra high quality remaster) in 2024 by Acoustic Sounds and reissued on vinyl and digitally on February 7, 2025.

==Lyrics==
&quot;Black Friday&quot;, which features Michael Omartian on piano and David Paich on Hohner electric piano and was released as the first single from the album, relates the story of a crooked speculator who makes his fortune and absconds to Muswellbrook, New South Wales, Australia, as, according to Fagen, &quot;It was the place most far away from LA we could think of&quot;. The town also &quot;fit[s] the metre of the song and rhyme[s] with &#x27;book&#x27;&quot;, though Fagen did not realise that locals pronounce it &quot;Musselbrook&quot; (omitting the &quot;w&quot;), which makes the song grating for Australian fans.

==Title and packaging==
The album&#x27;s title comes from the lyrics of &quot;Doctor Wu&quot; (&quot;Katy lies / You can see it in her eyes&quot;), and the album cover is a picture of a katydid, a &quot;singing&quot; (stridulating) insect related to crickets and grasshoppers, as a pun on the title. Walter Becker told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, during the band&#x27;s 2009 tour: &quot;It&#x27;s about that uneasy relationship between the patient and doctor. People put faith in doctors, yet they abuse their power and become dangerous.&quot; The back cover photograph of Donald Fagen (in reindeer sweater) and Denny Dias (in overalls and sombrero and holding a tank of helium) was taken by Becker during the session (sometime in 1972-73) for their Schlitz beer jingle.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing the album in 1975 for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said that, while &quot;Katy Lied&quot; might be Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;biggest&quot; album to that point, he found it &quot;slightly disappointing&quot; on a musical level, citing the loss of lead guitarist Baxter and what he perceived as &quot;cool, cerebral, one-dimensional&quot; jazz guitar influences. Nonetheless, Christgau admitted that he played the album frequently, and he voted it the third-best album of the year on his ballot for the 1975 Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll, on which it placed sixth. John Mendelsohn was more critical in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, writing that &quot;however immaculately tasteful and intelligent&quot; Steely Dan&#x27;s music may be in theory, it did not register with him emotionally and remained &quot;exemplarily well-crafted and uncommonly intelligent schlock&quot;. Mendelsohn found the lyrics interesting, but inscrutable, the musicianship tasteful and well-performed, but not stimulating, and Fagen&#x27;s singing unique-sounding, but seemingly passionless. In a review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; from 1977, Cameron Crowe called the album &quot;anonymous, absolutely impeccable swing-pop&quot; with &quot;no cheap displays of human emotion&quot;.

Retrospectively, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as &quot;a smoother version of &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot;&quot; and &quot;another excellent record&quot; by Steely Dan. Travis Elborough wrote in his 2008 book &quot;The Long-Player Goodbye: The Album from LP to iPod and Back Again&quot; that &quot;Katy Lied&quot;, while not on par with &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (1974) or &quot;Aja&quot; (1977), was still &quot;up there as jazz rock staples go&quot;. In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield said the album completed a trilogy of Steely Dan albums (the other parts being &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot;) that is &quot;a rock version of &quot;Chinatown&quot;, a film noir tour of L.A.&#x27;s decadent losers, showbiz kids, and razor boys&quot;. Jazz historian Ted Gioia cited the album as an example of Steely Dan &quot;proving that pop-rock could equally benefit from a healthy dose of jazz&quot; during their initial tenure, which coincided with a period when rock musicians frequently experimented with jazz idioms and techniques.

Of lead single &quot;Black Friday&quot;, &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it contains elements that made earlier Steely Dan singles successful, such as &quot;Hot Fender Rhodes piano tracks, lead guitar work, rhythm that won&#x27;t stop cooking and identifiable vocals and mix that lets you know Gary Katz has been hard at work on the knobs.&quot;

<doc id="580521" wikidata="Q4709" url="?curid=580521" title="Barquisimeto">
<text>Barquisimeto (; ) is a city in Venezuela. Barquisimeto is located in the Central-Western Region, Venezuela. It is the capital of the state of Lara and head of Iribarren Municipality. It is an important urban, industrial, commercial and transportation center of the country, recognized as the fourth-largest city by population and area in Venezuela after Caracas, Maracaibo and Valencia.

== History ==
Barquisimeto was founded in 1552 by Juan de Villegas, as a headquarters and to have better control of the territory believed to be rich in gold. Its original name was Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto and then it was shortened to just Barquisimeto.

This city changed locations four times between 1552 and 1563. The original settlement was near the Buría River, but moved in 1556 due to frequent floods suffered by inhabitants. The second location was in the valley of the Turbio River, where the city stayed until Lope de Aguirre burned it down in 1561. The city was rebuilt , but in 1562 they inhabitants asked for permission to move to another site due to strong winds blowing in the place. Finally, Barquisimeto was located on the north plateau of the Turbio River in 1563.

During the country&#x27;s independence, Barquisimeto joined the liberation movement and its deputy José Ángel Álamo signed the Independence Act on July 5, 1811.

In 1929, the city went through a modernization program carried out by General Juan Vicente Gomez. He fixed the streets and avenues and buildings were built, like the Jacinto Lara Headquarters, the Government Palace and the Ayacucho Park.

=== Names and etymology ===
According to the German adventurer Nikolaus Federmann, the Caquetío aborigines used to call it Variquicimeto, which translates as &quot;ash-colored river&quot;, the name with which the natives distinguished the water stream near the city. This river was named &quot;Turbio River&quot; by the Spanish conquerors, a name that is still in use today. Another possible name origin is due to a red dye called &quot;bariquí&quot;.

When Juan de Villegas founded it, he named the city &quot;Nueva Segovia de Barquisimeto&quot;, but years later it became just &quot;Barquisimeto&quot;, a word popularized by Oviedo y Baños in his book &quot;History and Conquest of the Venezuelan Population&quot;.

== Religion ==

The city&#x27;s modern Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is the cathedral of the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Barquisimeto.

=== Divina Pastora ===
The Divina Pastora (Divine Shepherdess) is a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the infant Jesus, with a lamb at her side. It is considered to be one of the most important religious icons of Venezuela. Divina Pastora is the patron saint of the city of Barquisimeto and of the Venezuelan National Militia. The original image dates from 1735. Divina Pastora is celebrated in a procession on January 14 of each year, when a massive Marian procession occurs, considered to be one of the largest in the world, attracting thousands of pilgrims.

The statue is removed from its shrine and is carried on the main streets of Barquisimeto in a procession which starts at the Iglesia de la Divina Pastora in Santa Rosa until it reaches the Barquisimeto Cathedral. This procession is unlike other mass Marian celebrations in the world, where the image does not leave its temple. This procession occurs due to the devotion the people of Barquisimeto have towards it as gratitude towards saving the city from a cholera outbreak that occurred in the city in the 19th century. In 2013, 3,000,000 faithful honored the Divina Pastora.

== Geography ==
Barquisimeto is located on the terrace of the same name, on the banks of the Turbio River, above sea level and a population of 930,000 inhabitants. It has a location on the central western of Venezuela ( from Caracas, the country&#x27;s capital city), being a point of convergence of many of the major land routes and rail, characterized also by its street order and appropriate signage due to the location of the city with a relief almost completely flat, which facilitated the distribution of the urban grid and with the streets numbered in ascending numerical order, factors that help the foreign citizen and easily locate addresses. Its climate is pleasant in the months of December to March, with an average temperature of throughout the year.

=== Neighboring municipalities ===
* North: Urdaneta Municipality
* South: Palavecino Municipality

=== Climate ===
In the city, a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) is dominant. Located in that region, Barquisimeto records of rain per year and its average temperature ranges . However, in higher regions near the Andes, temperatures are lower and the rain is more constant. For instance, in Sanare city, the annual average rainfall is .

== Transportation ==
The Transbarca system is a new &quot;bus rapid transit&quot; (BRT) system under construction, which was originally planned to use trolleybuses. When construction began, in 2006, the system was projected to serve an average of 170,000 people per day when completed, using 80 trolleybuses operating along of exclusive lanes, across the metropolitan area. Service was planned to include an express route of along with one local route of . With 52 stations, the BRT system is to include a centralized system of communication and security, and structures for easy access for elderly and disabled people. It is to be complemented with feeder routes, covering the areas of Greater Barquisimeto the BRT line will not serve, which will connect with the main line at terminal stations.

Although 80 articulated trolleybuses were purchased from Neoplan and delivered around 2008–09, the plans to operate the Transbarca system with those vehicles were dropped in 2013. In addition to reasons of cost, an inadequate supply of electricity with which to power the system was cited in the announcement of the decision.

* Buses are the main means of mass transportation. The system runs a variety of bus types, operated by several companies on normal streets and avenues:
* bus; large buses.
* buseta; medium-sized buses.
* microbus or colectivo; vans or minivans.

<text>Charles Gunn is a character in the television series &quot;Angel&quot;, created by Joss Whedon and first introduced by writer Gary Campbell in the episode &quot;War Zone&quot;. The character is portrayed by J. August Richards and named by Whedon after filmmaker James Gunn and actor Sean Gunn, both of whom had worked with Whedon. Gunn is initially presented as the leader of a street gang that defends its neighborhood from vampires.

==Biography==

===Character history===
Gunn grew up in the Badlands, an environment of poverty and violence, where he had to face many challenges. Gunn used his street smarts and fighting skills to protect his community from vampire attacks. As a teenager, Gunn became the leader of a group of street fighters who fought against vampires in his neighborhood. Possessing the mind of a military strategist and the strength of a brawler, life in the city hardened Gunn to the extent that his life became less important than the cause, resulting in him trading his soul for a truck in a deal with a demon named Jenoff when he was only seventeen because he believed he had no future (cf. &quot;Double or Nothing&quot;).

===Angel Investigations===
Gunn is introduced in the season 1 episode &quot;War Zone&quot;, when he observes the vampire Angel roughing up a blackmailer and tries, unsuccessfully, to dust him. Later on, a gang of vampires at war with Gunn&#x27;s group attack their hideout, kidnapping several group members including Gunn&#x27;s sister Alonna. Eventually, Angel wins Gunn&#x27;s trust, but not in time to save Alonna from turning into a vampire. Left with no choice, Gunn stakes his own sister — a decision that haunts him through the series. Alonna&#x27;s death had a profound impact on Gunn, causing him to re-evaluate his priorities and seek help from Angel. Angel recognizes Gunn&#x27;s strength and often calls on him in battle or if he needs help protecting the people he cares about. Although he initially regards his time with Angel Investigations as a &quot;paying side gig&quot;, Gunn eventually becomes a full-time member of the gang, gaining mutual respect for those he fights side-by-side with while finding his place in the world. However, his work with his new &#x27;family&#x27; often leads to conflicted loyalties; in the episode &quot;Belonging&quot;, Cordelia is accidentally sucked into a portal to Pylea while a member of Gunn&#x27;s old street crew, George, succumbs to the bite of a vampire. Gunn feels responsible for his friend&#x27;s death, believing it would not have happened if he had still been around to help fight. Yet even in his grief, he realizes he could not commit the same crime twice and allow Cordelia to suffer the same fate, so he joins Angel, Wesley, and Lorne to rescue her.

A short time after their return from Pylea, demons across the city are being d regardless of whether or not they deserved to be killed. Gunn comes to the conclusion his old gang is responsible for the deaths, led by a man named Gio who has a grudge against supernatural entities due to an unrevealed event in his past (cf. &quot;That Old Gang of Mine&quot;). He realizes his ties with his old life are gone and his loyalty now lies with the vampire with a soul. In a showdown with one of his lifelong friends, Gunn chooses the mission of the Angel Investigations team and finds the future he thought he would never have. He has friends, loyalty, respect, and a mission. He even finds love in the arms of the new girl, Fred Burkle, but his past still comes back to haunt him in &quot;Double or Nothing&quot; when the demon Jenoff decides it is time to cash in on a deal made years earlier by claiming Gunn&#x27;s soul. The Angel Investigations are able to defeat Jenoff.

Fred becomes the most important person in Gunn&#x27;s world, and in &quot;Supersymmetry&quot;, he kills Professor Seidel (who deliberately sent Fred to Pylea) in order to save Fred from having to carry the burden of doing it herself. The guilt of what he had done for her plagues Fred, and instead of bringing them closer together, it begins the rift that leads to the end of their relationship. Although no longer romantically linked, Gunn and Fred continue to fight side-by-side, and Gunn has a fling with the electric Gwen Raiden in the episode &quot;Players&quot;. When Wolfram &amp; Hart want to cut a deal to have Angel take over the L.A. branch, Gunn is led into the mysterious White Room where he is exposed to the mysterious conduit of the Senior Partners, who impresses Gunn with his immense power. Soon, he undergoes a remarkable transformation at Wolfram &amp; Hart.

===Wolfram &amp; Hart===
Gunn underwent a procedure that gave him a deep understanding of the law and other skills, which made him a valuable asset to Angel&#x27;s team. (cf. &quot;Conviction&quot;). When his mental abilities begin to diminish, Gunn, fearful of losing his new talents and respect, makes a pact with Dr. Sparrow and gets a permanent upgrade in exchange for signing to release an ancient curio stuck in customs. When this curio results in the death of Fred and the resurrection of Illyria (cf. &quot;A Hole in the World&quot;), a guilt-ridden Gunn willingly offers himself to take Lindsey McDonald&#x27;s place in a hell dimension in order to obtain information on how to stop the Senior Partners (cf. &quot;Underneath&quot;). While the team has no clue how to free him, Illyria saves Gunn with ease. He then returns to the fold, changed and seeking redemption for his sins. In the show&#x27;s finale &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, he spends his potential-last day alive helping Anne Steele out at her youth help center and then slays Senator Helen Brucker, one of the members of the Circle of the Black Thorn, but is seriously injured in the process. While preparing for one last fight against the army of the Senior Partners, Illyria tells Gunn that he has only minutes to live; he replies, &quot;Then let&#x27;s make them memorable&quot;. Joss Whedon later discussed the final battle in SFX Magazine: &quot;Gunn is dead. Illyria fights on. Angel loses an arm. Spike gets Shanshu. And Xander loses another eye, which is funny because he isn&#x27;t even there.&quot;

J. August Richards later revealed in an interview that Gunn was intended to have become a vampire either in &quot;Angel&quot; season 6 or in the proposed &quot;Spike&quot; spin-off movie, had either project gone ahead: &quot;I&#x27;d probably have him come back as a vampire and then kill himself.&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s always how I wanted it to end for my character&quot;.

===After the Fall===
In the 1st issue of the &quot;&quot; comic series (which is the continuation of the &quot;Angel&quot; series), Gunn and a group he has assumed leadership of storm a stadium and kill Kr&#x27;ph, one of the demon lords of L.A., who has taken up residence there. The group frees humans who were forced to fight each other by the demon. Gunn then makes a suggestive comment to the demon&#x27;s female captives. At the end of the issue, Gunn is revealed to be a vampire, having been turned either during or after Team Angel&#x27;s battle with the Senior Partners&#x27; army at the end of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, who feeds on the women and turns the &quot;rescued&quot; men into vampires as part of &quot;Team Gunn&quot;.

However, in the second issue, Gunn insists that he is still a good guy. He resents being a vampire, though he is prone to murderous impulses due to his lack of a soul. He reveals that he blames Angel for his condition, believing he had allowed him to be turned, and that he intends to save Los Angeles to prove that one does not need a soul to be a champion. As part of his plans, he kidnaps the psychic fish Betta George and imprisons him, forcing George to tap into his psychic ability to freeze Slayers in their tracks and contact people outside of Hell/Los Angeles.

In a later issue, he is seen making mystical plans; the intent is to have Angel come to the conclusion he sent Gunn to die, then Angel himself will die moments later. As part of his revenge against Angel, Gunn destroys the Wolfram &amp; Hart building, Angel&#x27;s headquarters in the war with the Demon Lords, which also forces Wesley back to the Senior Partners for a short time. Gunn later bears witness to Angel&#x27;s defeat of the Lords, hanging back to ensure that not all of the people are slaughtered should Angel fail. Shortly after the team moves back into the Hyperion Hotel, Gunn confronts them and reveals his vampire nature.

Upon seeing what has become of Gunn, Angel tells him he is sorry. Gunn says he figured he would say that and tells him to table that for now. Gunn takes Angel around his base of operations and explains what happened to him. When Angel sees that Gunn thinks he is doing the right thing, she cautions him that the beast is in control, not him. Gunn attacks him, angered that Angel thinks that Gunn isn&#x27;t himself. Gunn proceeds to remove all of the magic that had kept Angel alive and realizes that Angel is now actually a human. Gunn decides to let Angel lie there and die slowly, only to be confronted by Wesley&#x27;s &quot;ghost&quot;, who reveals to him that the visions he has been receiving are from the Senior Partners rather than the Powers That Be. Ignoring this revelation, Gunn continues to attack his former friends, with his team of Slayers apparently staking Spike — although Spike is later seen alive thanks to Illyria&#x27;s timeslips — before he is kicked out of a window by Connor while trying to kill Angel again. Confronting Illyria, he tricks her into transforming into Fred so that he can shoot her, reverting her to her true form in the hope that he can convince her to use her powers to rewind time so that the Fall never occurs, only for Illyria to vow to unmake time itself. Realizing that the Senior Partners cannot allow him to die, Angel provokes Gunn into killing him, thus forcing the Senior Partners to reverse time to the original battle in the alleyway and giving Angel the opportunity to save Gunn before he is born. The group subsequently takes Gunn to the hospital, where he falls into a coma. In &quot;Aftermath&quot; #18 Gunn is shown driving a sports car. Gunn seems to be recovering from his wound well, but was stated not to be ready to rejoin the team yet. In &quot;Aftermath&quot; #23 Gunn is spotlighted. It is explained how he was cured so quickly from the attacks at the end of the series, and he and Illyria come to a mutual agreement and strike a friendship of sorts. In the end, Illyria and Gunn take off to find adventure, slay demons, and find a new direction in their lives.

Gunn eventually returns to Angel Investigations, though he nonetheless faces multiple difficulties upon his return, as Spike and Connor still regard him as a traitor due to his actions in Hell and are distrustful of him. When Connor took over the leadership of Angel Investigations after Angel was captured by Innovation Labs, a biotech company seeking to duplicate Angel&#x27;s status as an immortal with a soul, Gunn, while still loyal to Angel&#x27;s mission, left the team due to escalating disagreements and arguments with Connor. Gunn departs with the intent of starting his own crew and fighting the good fight his way, though he nonetheless intends to return when Angel is found. However, his attempts to start anew are briefly halted when he is attacked by Eddie Hope, an ice-manipulating devil who has been hunting down people for crimes they committed while Los Angeles was in Hell, while at a diner.

In the Angel &amp; Faith series, Gunn reconvenes with Angel, Faith, and Willow after they come to LA from London in the Family Reunion arc. Gunn has been sending reports to Angel on Connor&#x27;s normal life as well as updating him on the status of his other friends from LA. Gunn stays in the Hyperion Hotel to protect the tear in reality when the other four enter Qour&#x27;toth. He appears pleased at the positive place Angel and Connors&#x27; relationship has finally reached.

==Powers and abilities==
In the television series, Gunn is a normal human with no supernatural abilities, but he has strength and martial arts expertise due to his years as a vampire hunter, often described as &quot;the muscle&quot; of Angel Investigations. Episodes such as &quot;Darla&quot; and &quot;Reunion&quot; have proven that Gunn is also a talented and intelligent investigator. In season 5, he is given a &quot;legal upgrade&quot; by Wolfram &amp; Hart, which gives him knowledge of all legal codes, both human and demon, as well as fluency in some demonic languages, knowledge of golf techniques and all Gilbert &amp; Sullivan light operas. In the canonical comic book &quot;Angel: After the Fall&quot;, Gunn is depicted as having become a vampire, acquiring superhuman strength, speed, reflex durability, virtual immortality, accelerated healing, vulnerability to holy items and sunlight, and the necessity to feed on blood to maintain vitality. He claims that his &quot;inner demon&quot; is partially subdued by his earlier Wolfram &amp; Hart upgrades. By devouring a prophetic demon, Gunn also acquired its power to receive visions, which he believes come from the powers but in fact come from the Senior Partners. At the end of the series, time is reversed, and Gunn is an ordinary human again.

Gunn has displayed extensive knowledge of comic books and is considered to be a fan of pop culture.
*In the episode &quot;Supersymmetry&quot;, Gunn threatens a college student in a school bookstore by referencing the specific issue of &quot;Daredevil&quot; (#181) in which Bullseye kills Elektra, even quoting from the cover blurb, which reads &quot;...One wins, one dies.&quot;
*When commenting on how fast Illyria appears to move when using her time-warping abilities, Gunn compares her to three different incarnations of the Flash: Jay Garrick, Wally West, and Barry Allen. The reference elicits little response from his confused friends, so he merely says that it was &quot;like she was movin&#x27; really fast&quot;.
*In the episode &quot;First Impressions&quot;, Gunn mentions that he has not seen a movie since Denzel Washington&#x27;s portrayal of Malcolm X, for which he believes Washington was deserving of an Oscar.

==Appearance==
Following his mental upgrade, Gunn sheds his street look for the sleek, professional suits of a legal powerhouse. He also lets his hair grow slightly after having had it shaved in all previous seasons, which comes as a surprise to Cordelia in the episode &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot;. In the final episodes, Gunn comes full circle, returning to his roots, taking back his street clothes, and reawakening his purpose as a soldier in the fight against evil.

==Relationships==

===Romantic interests===
* Veronica — Gunn had a romance with this girl prior to becoming a full-time member of Angel Investigations. She appears briefly in &quot;First Impressions&quot;, in which her non-fatal injury at the hands of a vampire brings back painful memories and feelings of guilt about Alonna.
* Winifred &quot;Fred&quot; Burkle — Gunn and Fred fall in love and continue a strong relationship throughout much of seasons 3 and 4, which was ruptured when Gunn murdered a human being in order to protect Fred&#x27;s innocence. Nevertheless, he retains strong feelings of friendship for her and is devastated by her death, for which he is partially responsible. Unlike the other characters, who usually referred to Gunn by his surname, Fred always called him Charles and continued to do so following their breakup.
* Gwen Raiden flirts with Gunn in her first two appearances, and they have sex in the episode &quot;Players&quot;, when, with Gunn&#x27;s assistance, Gwen gains the ability to touch people without harming them.

===Friendships===
* Wesley Wyndam-Pryce — During Angel&#x27;s temporary absence from the group in season 2, Gunn and Wesley develop a brothers-in-arms bond. This friendship continues to develop but is strained by romantic rivalry over Fred (cf. &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;). The friendship between Gunn and Wesley deteriorates further after Wesley misguidedly attempts to kidnap Angel&#x27;s son Connor and is accordingly fired from the agency. However, in season 4, Wesley is gradually reintroduced to the AI team, and the pair are friends again by season 5. The Beast&#x27;s attack on Los Angeles requires Wes and AI to join forces, and Wes saves Gunn&#x27;s life in their first confrontation with the creature. This friendship is again put under stress when the creation of Illyria (for which Gunn is indirectly responsible) causes Fred&#x27;s death and Wesley stabs Gunn with a scalpel. The pair eventually reconcile.
* Cordelia Chase advocated for bringing Gunn into &quot;Team Angel&quot;, and pushed for him to start getting paid as well as making sure the team began to see him as an equal. Gunn quickly began to respect her and not just think of her as a &quot;Barbie doll&quot;, as he did in the beginning. Over the years, a solid friendship was formed.

<doc id="580526" wikidata="Q675010" url="?curid=580526" title="Lysosomal storage disease">
<text>Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs; ) are a group of over 70 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function. Lysosomes are sacs of enzymes within cells that digest large molecules and pass the fragments on to other parts of the cell for recycling. This process requires several critical enzymes. If one of these enzymes is defective due to a mutation, the large molecules accumulate within the cell, eventually killing it.

Lysosomal storage disorders are caused by lysosomal dysfunction usually as a consequence of deficiency of a single enzyme required for the metabolism of lipids, glycoproteins (sugar-containing proteins), or mucopolysaccharides. Individually, lysosomal storage diseases occur with incidences of less than 1:100,000; however, as a group, the incidence is about 1:5,000 – 1:10,000. Most of these disorders are autosomal recessively inherited such as Niemann–Pick disease, type C, but a few are X-linked recessively inherited, such as Fabry disease and Hunter syndrome (MPS II).

The lysosome is commonly referred to as the cell&#x27;s recycling center because it processes unwanted material into substances that the cell can use. Lysosomes break down this unwanted matter by enzymes, highly specialized proteins essential for survival. Lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme exists in too small an amount or is missing altogether. When this happens, substances accumulate in the cell. In other words, when the lysosome does not function normally, excess products destined for breakdown and recycling are stored in the cell.

Like other genetic disorders, individuals inherit lysosomal storage diseases from their parents. Although each disorder results from different gene mutations that translate into a deficiency in enzyme activity, they all share a common biochemical characteristic – all lysosomal disorders originate from an abnormal accumulation of substances inside the lysosome.

Lysosomal storage diseases affect mostly children and they often die at a young age, many within a few months or years of birth.

==Classification==

===Standard classification===
The lysosomal storage diseases are generally classified by the nature of the primary stored material involved, and can be broadly broken into the following: (ICD-10 codes are provided where available)
* (E75) Lipid storage disorders
** Gangliosidoses (including Tay–Sachs disease (E75.0-E75.1) - they are a subtype of sphingolipidoses
** Sphingolipidoses that are not gangliosidoses, including Gaucher&#x27;s and Niemann–Pick diseases (E75.2-E75.3)
** Leukodystrophies
* (E76.0) Mucopolysaccharidoses, including Hunter syndrome and Hurler disease
* (E77) Glycoprotein storage disorders
* (E77.0-E77.1, E75.11) Mucolipidoses; Mucolipidosis IV is a gangliosidosis

Also, glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease) is a defect in lysosomal metabolism as well, although it is otherwise classified into E74.0 in ICD-10. Cystinosis is an lysosomal storage disease characterized by the abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine.

===By type of defect protein===
Alternatively to the protein targets, lysosomal storage diseases may be classified by the type of protein that is deficient and is causing buildup.

===Lysosomal storage disorders===
Lysosomal storage diseases include:
==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of lysosomal storage diseases vary depending on the particular disorder and other variables such as the age of onset, and can be mild to severe. They can include developmental delay, movement disorders, seizures, dementia, deafness, and/or blindness. Some people with lysosomal storage diseases have enlarged livers or spleens, pulmonary and cardiac problems, and bones that grow abnormally.

==Diagnosis==
The majority of patients are initially screened by enzyme assay, which is the most efficient method to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. In some families where the disease-causing mutations are known, and in certain genetic isolates, mutation analysis may be performed. In addition, after a diagnosis is made by biochemical means, mutation analysis may be performed for certain disorders.

==Treatment==
No cures for lysosomal storage diseases are known, and treatment is mostly symptomatic, although bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been tried with some success. ERT can minimize symptoms and prevent permanent damage to the body. In addition, umbilical cord blood transplantation is being performed at specialized centers for a number of these diseases. In addition, substrate reduction therapy, a method used to decrease the production of storage material, is currently being evaluated for some of these diseases. Furthermore, chaperone therapy, a technique used to stabilize the defective enzymes produced by patients, is being examined for certain of these disorders. The experimental technique of gene therapy may offer cures in the future.

Ambroxol has recently been shown to increase activity of the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, so it may be a useful therapeutic agent for both Gaucher disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Ambroxol triggers the secretion of lysosomes from cells by inducing a pH-dependent calcium release from acidic calcium stores. Hence, relieving the cell from accumulating degradation products is a proposed mechanism by which this drug may help.

==History==
Tay–Sachs disease was the first of these disorders to be described, in 1881, followed by Gaucher disease in 1882. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, de Duve and colleagues, using cell fractionation techniques, cytological studies, and biochemical analyses, identified and characterized the lysosome as a cellular organelle responsible for intracellular digestion and recycling of macromolecules. This was the scientific breakthrough that would lead to the understanding of the physiological basis of the lysosomal storage diseases. Pompe disease was the first disease to be identified as an lysosomal storage disease in 1963, with L. Hers reporting the cause as a deficiency of α-glucosidase. Hers also suggested that other diseases, such as the mucopolysaccharidosis, might be due to enzyme deficiencies.

<text>Degtyaryov Plant (, English: Open Joint Stock Company &quot;V. A. Degtyaryov Plant&quot;) or ZiD (Zavod imeni Dеgtyaryovа) is one of the most important weapon and vehicle producing enterprises of Russia. The company is named after Vasily Alekseyevich Degtyaryov (2 January 1880, Tula – 16 January 1949), a Soviet and Russian engineer who specialized in weapons design.

Degtyaryov Plant is a subsidiary of High Precision Systems (Rostec).

<text>Eloise Jarvis McGraw (December 9, 1915 – November 30, 2000) was an American author of children&#x27;s books and young adult novels.

== Early life ==
Eloise Jarvis McGraw was born on December 9, 1915 in Houston, Texas. At age 8 her family moved to Oklahoma City, at which time she began writing.

== Career ==

Her first published book was &quot;Sawdust in His Shoes&quot;, in 1950, followed by a steady stream of works for both children and adults.

McGraw also contributed to the Oz series started by L. Frank Baum; working with her daughter, graphic artist and librarian Lauren Lynn McGraw, she wrote &quot;Merry Go Round in Oz&quot; (the last of the Oz books issued by Baum&#x27;s publisher) and &quot;The Forbidden Fountain of Oz&quot;. The actual writing of the books was done entirely by Eloise; Lauren made story contributions significant enough for Eloise to assign her co-authorship credit. McGraw&#x27;s &quot;The Rundelstone of Oz&quot; was published in 2000 without a credit to her daughter.

Author Gina Wickwar credited McGraw with help in the editing of her book &quot;The Hidden Prince of Oz&quot; (2000).

McGraw painted the cover art for most of her books.

=== Awards ===

She was awarded the Newbery Honor three times in three different decades, for her novels &quot;Moccasin Trail&quot; (1952), &quot;The Golden Goblet&quot; (1962), and &quot;The Moorchild&quot; (1997). &quot;A Really Weird Summer&quot; (1977) won an Edgar Award for Best Juvenile Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America, as later did &quot;Tangled Web&quot; (1994). McGraw had a very strong interest in history, and among the many books she wrote for children are &quot;Greensleeves&quot;, &quot;The Seventeenth Swap&quot;, &quot;The Striped Ships&quot; and &quot;Mara, Daughter of the Nile&quot;. A Lewis Carroll Shelf Award was given to &quot;Moccasin Trail&quot; in 1963.

== Personal life ==
McGraw lived for many years in Portland, Oregon before dying in late 2000 of &quot;complications of cancer.&quot; She was married to William Corbin McGraw, who died in 1999. They had two children, Peter and Lauren.

<doc id="580533" wikidata="Q1205260" url="?curid=580533" title="Women in WWE">
<text>Throughout its history, women have served in various onscreen roles in the American professional wrestling promotion WWE. In the 1990s, WWE (then known as the World Wrestling Federation) introduced the term Diva to refer to its female performers, including wrestlers, managers or valets, backstage interviewers, or ring announcers.

At WrestleMania 32 in 2016, WWE announced their discontinuation of the &quot;Diva&quot; branding for its female performers, as part of a move to present them in an athletic manner more in line with their male counterparts, rather than in a means based around sex appeal. The promotion began to refer to them using the &quot;Superstar&quot; title it uses for male performers, and established a new WWE Women&#x27;s Championship to replace the WWE Divas Championship. Subsequently, women&#x27;s matches were featured more prominently across their programming, which included more frequent main event positions. WrestleMania 35 featured a women&#x27;s match as its main event for the first time in WrestleMania history.

== History ==
=== Early history (1980s–1990s) ===

In 1983, The Fabulous Moolah, who was the NWA World Women&#x27;s Champion and legal owner of the title, joined the WWF and sold them the rights to the title after they disaffiliated from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and recognized her as the first WWF Women&#x27;s Champion. Additionally, the WWF also recognized Moolah as having been champion ever since first winning the title from Judy Grable in 1956 and disregarded other reigns or title losses that occurred during the title&#x27;s existence in the NWA. Thus, The Fabulous Moolah&#x27;s reign was considered to have lasted 28 years by the promotion. WWF also introduced the WWF Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship with Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria recognized as the first champions after also defecting from the NWA.

The following year, music artist Cyndi Lauper began a verbal feud with her manager &quot;Captain&quot; Lou Albano; this brought professional wrestling into mainstream culture in a storyline that became known as the &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection&quot;. When it was finally time for Lauper and Albano to settle their differences in the ring, a match-up was scheduled with Albano&#x27;s represented wrestler Moolah against the challenge of Lauper&#x27;s protégé, Wendi Richter. Moolah lost the title at &quot;The Brawl to End It All&quot;, broadcast live on MTV. Richter then lost the title to Leilani Kai the following year, but won it back at WrestleMania I on March 31, 1985. It was during the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling Connection that the WWF introduced its first female referee, Rita Chatterton.

In the summer of 1985, the WWF did a storyline where all established managers in the promotion competed to offer their services to Randy Savage. Savage revealed his new manager to be Miss Elizabeth on the August 24, 1985, edition of &quot;WWF Prime Time Wrestling&quot;. In real life, Savage and Miss Elizabeth were married, but this was not mentioned on television. Miss Elizabeth&#x27;s first major angle was during Savage&#x27;s feud with George &quot;The Animal&quot; Steele in 1986. In the angle, Steele fell in love with Miss Elizabeth, angering Savage and leading to a series of grudge matches between him and Steele. She also figured prominently in Savage&#x27;s 1986 feuds with Hulk Hogan and Ricky &quot;the Dragon&quot; Steamboat and his 1987–1989 feuds with wrestlers such as The Honky Tonk Man, Andre the Giant, Bad News Brown, Big Boss Man and Akeem. In 1988, Miss Elizabeth was given the title &quot;First Lady of the World Wrestling Federation&quot; due to her being the first woman in World Wrestling Federation history to manage the World Wrestling Federation champion. When Savage—who had formed an alliance with Hogan—turned on Hogan in early 1989, Miss Elizabeth was a major factor, and she eventually sided with Hogan. Meanwhile, Savage became allied with &quot;Sensational&quot; Sherri, who had success as a wrestler from 1987 to 1989 and was phased into a role as an ill-tempered, venomous manager.

Sherri initially debuted on July 24, 1987, by defeating The Fabulous Moolah for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship. Renaming herself &#x27;Sensational&#x27; Sherri, she reigned as champion for fifteen months before losing it to Rockin&#x27; Robin; after losing several rematches, Martel took a short leave of absence in early 1989 before being repackaged as Savage&#x27;s manager. Also in 1987 Mike McGuirk was introduced as the first female ring announcer of the promotion, arriving after Jesse Ventura referred her to the WWF. In the fall of 1987, McGuirk provided color commentary for several arena show tapings in the Houston, Texas area, which aired on &quot;Prime Time Wrestling&quot;.

The first Survivor Series pay-per-view saw the first female elimination match. In February 1989, the WWF Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship was deactivated and The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai and Judy Martin) were the final title holders. Sapphire debuted in November 1989 on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXV&quot; as a &#x27;fan&#x27; cheering on Dusty Rhodes at ringside in his match against Big Boss Man. Sapphire began to manage Rhodes, who adapted Rhodes&#x27; gimmick as she adorned black outfits with yellow polka dots. Sapphire and Rhodes later feuded with Randy Savage and Sensational Sherri and wrestled in a tag team match at WrestleMania VI. Rockin&#x27; Robin was the last WWF Women&#x27;s Champion in the late 1980s.

In 1990, Sensational Sherri remained with Randy Savage, while Sapphire worked with Dusty Rhodes. Sapphire later departed from the company in mid-1990. Miss Elizabeth worked primarily with Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire between WrestleMania VI and SummerSlam (1990). Miss Elizabeth returned in 1991 and was a key player in Randy Savage&#x27;s retirement match with The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania VII; Miss Elizabeth left the company for good in April 1992; shortly after her departure, Savage and Miss Elizabeth divorced in real life. At WrestleMania IX, Luna Vachon debuted and initially aligned herself with Shawn Michaels. Later, she aligned herself with Bam Bam Bigelow to feud with Sherri and Tatanka. Martel left the company in 1993.

=== Japanese involvement and Diva beginnings (1993–1997) ===

In 1993, the WWF reinstated its Women&#x27;s Championship, a title that had been vacant since 1990, and Madusa Miceli was brought in by the company to revive the women&#x27;s division. She debuted under the ring name Alundra Blayze, because WWF owner Vince McMahon did not want to pay Miceli to use the name Madusa, which she had trademarked. She wrestled in a six-woman tournament to crown a new Women&#x27;s Champion, and in the finals, she pinned Heidi Lee Morgan on the December 13, 1993, episode of &quot;All American Wrestling&quot; to win the title.

After the tournament, Miceli asked WWF management to bring in new women for her to wrestle and WWF brought Leilani Kai, Bull Nakano and Bertha Faye. Later on as part of a short talent exchange with All Japan Women&#x27;s Pro Wrestling, various Japanese female wrestlers including Aja Kong debuted leading to the second elimination match at the Survivor Series 1995 event. In December, due to financial troubles the WWF was having at the time, Blayze was released from her contract and was stripped of the title following her jump back to rival company World Championship Wrestling, and the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship remained vacant until 1998.

In 1994, WWF signed Sunny as a manager for Chris Candido, becoming considered as the first WWF Diva. Between 1996 and 1998, several valets debuted in WWF: Marlena, Sable and Debra. Following Blayze&#x27;s controversial exit from the company, the women&#x27;s division became inactive during this time. At first, the characters were a continuation of the WWE female manager, but became more sexualized as time progressed. In 1996, Sunny was awarded as the manager of the year and her immense popularity expanded beyond professional wrestling when she was regarded as &quot;AOL&quot;″s most downloaded woman, solidifying herself as one of the preeminent figures within WWF. In February 1997, Chyna joined WWF as an antithesis to the rest of the women, a masculine bodybuilder whose sexual identity was the subject of early storylines. Sunny, Marlena, Sable, and Debra were further marketed as sex symbols through WWF&#x27;s &quot;Raw Magazine&quot;, which featured monthly spreads of the women in suggestive poses either semi-nude or wearing provocative clothing.
=== Attitude Era (1997–2002) ===

Sable&#x27;s eclipsed popularity and her feud with Marc Mero and his new manager, Jacqueline led to the reinstatement of the Women&#x27;s Championship as well as the promotion&#x27;s hiring of more female wrestlers. Jacqueline won the title and became the first African-American Women&#x27;s Champion. Meanwhile, Sable&#x27;s popularity led her to be a &quot;Playboy&quot; cover girl, although unlike other women, it was written in her contract that she was not allowed to take bumps. In July 1998, Sunny was released from her contract.

Sable became the first WWF female talent to refer to herself as a &quot;Diva&quot; during the April 19 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in 1999; the term shortly thereafter became the official title for WWF&#x27;s female performers. During the August 9, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Chyna became the first woman to main event a pro-wrestling prime time show when she defeated Triple H and The Undertaker in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship, the only woman to ever do so. Veteran wrestlers The Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young returned to WWF, mostly used as comedic roles. At No Mercy on October 17, 1999, 76-year-old Moolah defeated Ivory to win the Women&#x27;s Championship, becoming the oldest WWF Women&#x27;s Champion ever.
The late 1990s also brought in new women, such as B.B and The Kat, who won the women&#x27;s championship.

In 1999, Chyna became the first woman to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship when she defeated Jeff Jarrett. She would win the title one more time in 2000 when she defeated Val Venis and Trish Stratus in a mixed tag team match. She also became the first woman to participate in a Royal Rumble match, entering in the 1999 and 2000 editions, as well as participating in the 1999 edition of the King of the Ring tournament. She also was on the cover for &quot;Playboy&quot;. According to her manager, Vince McMahon offered Chyna to win the WWF Championship if she rejected the offer.

The year 2000 saw the debuts of Lita, Trish Stratus, and Molly Holly since the start of February. Lita performed higher-risk moves than the divas before her, such as moonsaults and diving hurricanranas. Shortly thereafter, Trish Stratus debuted as an overtly sexualized valet. Also, later that year, Molly Holly was added to the roster. She was a contrast to most of the other Divas as she was given a more wholesome gimmick and more modest ring attire. On the August 21 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; defending champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley wrestled Lita in the main event.

Finally, the spring of 2001 saw the WWF&#x27;s purchase of its chief competitors, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and the consequent entry of former WCW and ECW female talent, such as Stacy Keibler, Torrie Wilson, Jazz, and Sharmell. WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Chyna left the WWF towards the end of November due to real-life issues between herself, Triple H, and Stephanie McMahon. In the autumn of 2001, Trish Stratus was trained by Fit Finlay, who was the road agent responsible for the women&#x27;s matches, and drastically improved her in-ring ability. She worked her way up to the top of the division and eventually won the Women&#x27;s Championship at Survivor Series. Stratus then entered in a prominent feud with Jazz who debuted at Survivor Series.
=== Ruthless Aggression Era (2002–2008) ===
Much of the year of 2002 centered around Trish Stratus and her feuds with Jazz, Molly Holly, and a re-debuting Victoria including over the Women&#x27;s Championship. In April, while filming a small acting role for &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, Lita suffered a neck injury and was the first female talent to have neck fusion surgery. She was out of action for almost a year and a half. As she rehabilitated, she kept herself visible by co-hosting &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; on MTV.

Since May 5, 2002, the women&#x27;s division saw an expansion including a departure and a return of a former talent when the WWF officially changed its name to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as the company first began to hire more female talents than ever before, including female winners of the reality television show Tough Enough, which featured contestants aspiring to be professional wrestlers (Nidia in 2001, Linda Miles and Jackie Gayda in 2002). Debra departed the company in June along with her then-husband Stone Cold Steve Austin. Sable returned to WWE on the April 3, 2003, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for the first time since controversially departing from the company in late 1999; her first storyline returning to the company for several months was with new &quot;Playboy&quot; covergirl Torrie Wilson. The WWE women&#x27;s division competed in more match-ups previously contested only by men (including for the Women&#x27;s Championship), such as street fights and hardcore matches. The debuting Gail Kim would go on to become the first woman of Asian descent to have held the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship after winning a battle royal. Numerous Divas competed in contests ranging from &quot;Pillow Fights&quot; and &quot;Bra and Panties&quot; match-ups to &quot;Bikini Contests&quot;, which were based more on the sexual appeal of the women involved. Women&#x27;s trainer Fit Finlay said he was embarrassed to explain to the women how to strip during bra and panties match. According to him, &quot;It was degrading to them&quot; and tried to teach them how to wrestle, but WWE told him they do not want women to wrestle like men.

Victoria and Lita competed in the first Women&#x27;s steel cage match towards the end of the year on November 24.
WWE eventually re-introduced the Diva Search, in which Christy Hemme became the inaugural winner. In December 2004, Lita and Trish Stratus main-evented &quot;Raw&quot; for the Women&#x27;s Championship, making it the second time in history for female talents to main event one of WWE&#x27;s main shows. Moreover, Lita became the only female talent to main event &quot;Raw&quot; on three occasions including winning the Women&#x27;s Championship.

Since mid-2004 and through various periods over the years until the year of 2011, most of the original female roster departed from the company, most notably in 2006, when Trish Stratus retired at Unforgiven and Lita retired at Survivor Series.

During this period, several women made their debut, like Melina, Mickie James, Beth Phoenix, and Layla.

On the March 5, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mickie James and Melina competed in the first Falls Count Anywhere match to be contested between Divas. It was also the first time that the Women&#x27;s Championship was contested in this type of match. At in 2007, Candice Michelle became the first woman from the WWE Diva Search contest to become the WWE Women&#x27;s Champion. In December 2007, Trish Stratus, Lita, Molly Holly, and Sunny returned to WWE for a one-night special appearance on an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; due to the show&#x27;s 15th anniversary. At One Night Stand 2008, Beth Phoenix and Melina competed in the first &quot;I Quit&quot; match to be contested between Divas.
=== PG Era and Divas Championship (2008–2012) ===
In 2008, WWE entered its PG Era and adapted a family-friendly format. WWE distanced itself from the sexual content that was pervasive throughout previous eras. However, the role of women within WWE during this time was criticized because their matches were not as integral to the show as male wrestler&#x27;s matches were.

In March 2008, Mae Young became the third woman to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. At The Great American Bash 2008, Michelle McCool defeated Natalya to become the inaugural holder of the WWE Divas Championship, a championship exclusive to the SmackDown brand. In January 2009, Victoria lost to Michelle McCool in her last match, leaving WWE shortly after. At Wrestlemania 25, several female WWE legends including Sunny, Molly Holly, Victoria and Torrie Wilson, alongside former Divas Joy Giovanni and Jackie Gayda made a one-night return to participate in the 25-Diva Battle Royal, which was won by &#x27;Santina&#x27; Marella. The match was heavily criticized by several wrestling news outlets for its degrading booking of Divas in WWE. During the 2009 WWE draft, the championships switched brands after Women&#x27;s Champion Melina was drafted to the SmackDown brand and Divas Champion Maryse was drafted to Raw. Beth Phoenix made history by becoming the second woman to compete at the Royal Rumble event that year and managed to eliminate The Great Khali. In March 2010, Wendi Richter was inducted into the Hall of Fame as part of the 2010 class, making her first appearance on the promotion in over 20 years. The Women&#x27;s Championship was unified with the Divas Championship at Night of Champions 2010, as then Divas Champion Melina faced then-self-professed co-Women&#x27;s Champion Michelle McCool (as part of LayCool with Layla) in a lumberjill match, which McCool won. This also made the Women&#x27;s Championship defunct after 54 years, making Layla the final holder and only woman of Arab descent to have held the championship. During that year, Alicia Fox became the first and only African-American WWE Divas Champion.

&quot;NXT&quot; replaced &quot;ECW&quot; programming in 2010. Originally existing as a seasonal show which was presented as a hybrid between reality television and WWE&#x27;s scripted live event shows, selected wrestlers from WWE&#x27;s then-developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) participated in a competition to become WWE&#x27;s next &quot;breakout star&quot;. The third season, which aired in late 2010, featured only female contestants and was won by Kaitlyn.

In April 2011, Sunny was inducted into the Hall of Fame, becoming the fifth woman to receive the honor.

Kharma made her debut at Extreme Rules 2011 by attacking Michelle McCool, and attacked other divas over the next couple weeks on &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, however this was cut short as she was granted a maternity leave due to her real-life pregnancy. 2011 saw the departures of Maryse and Michelle McCool, the latter of whom retired from WWE on May 1, after losing to Layla in a Loser Leaves WWE match; Melina, who was released in early August; and Gail Kim resigned from the company due to frustration with their lack of focus on the women&#x27;s division.

At Royal Rumble 2012, Kharma returned and entered the Royal Rumble, becoming the third woman to enter the match. On the April 23, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nikki Bella defeated Beth Phoenix in a lumberjill match for the Divas Championship, ending Phoenix&#x27;s reign as champion at 204 days. Layla returned from her injury on April 29, 2012, at Extreme Rules and defeated Nikki Bella to become the fifth woman to have held both titles. The Bella Twins&#x27; contracts expired the following night, where they were fired by Eve Torres in the storyline.

On July 9, 2012, Eve Torres and AJ Lee became the first Divas to main event &quot;Raw&quot; since Trish Stratus and Lita in 2004, in a tag team match alongside CM Punk and Daniel Bryan. During mid-2012, AJ became involved in various relationship storylines with several male wrestlers such as CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, Kane, John Cena and Dolph Ziggler, including a stint as the General Manager of &quot;Raw&quot;. The later part of 2012 saw the departures of Kharma, Kelly Kelly, and Beth Phoenix. A month after Phoenix&#x27;s October departure, WWE published an article on their website claiming that there was a new era for the Divas division.

In the summer of 2012, the WWE hired veteran independent wrestler Sara Amato as a trainer for the women. Under Amato&#x27;s guidance, catfights and hair-pulling were eliminated and were replaced by strikes, forearms, punches, and kicking just like the male wrestlers were taught to do.

=== Beginning of &quot;Total Divas&quot; (2013–2015) ===
The 20th anniversary of &quot;Raw&quot; on January 14, 2013, saw Kaitlyn defeat Eve Torres for the Divas Championship. Eve departed the company later that night after her contract expired. The Bella Twins returned to WWE on the March 11, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Kaitlyn lost her Divas Championship to her former tag team partner AJ Lee on Payback, ending her reign at 153 days. The first in-ring Divas contract signing took place on the July 12, 2013, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; between AJ Lee and Kaitlyn, as part of buildup for a rematch of the Divas Championship at Money In the Bank. AJ defeated Kaitlyn to retain the title at the event.

In August 2012, WWE ceased operating FCW, its developmental promotion in Tampa, Florida, deactivating FCW titles, and began running all of its developmental events and operations at Full Sail University under the &quot;WWE NXT&quot; banner. In October 2012, WWE hired Renee Young, and in September 2013, Young made her commentary debut on &quot;NXT&quot;, making her the first female on-air commentator in the company in over a decade.

In April 2013, Summer Rae made her main roster debut, becoming the first Diva to be called up from the rebranded NXT. In July 2013, the first season of the &quot;Total Divas&quot; reality television show starring WWE Divas premiered. On the August 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, AJ Lee cut a worked shoot promo on the cast of &quot;Total Divas&quot;, stemming again, but partially from the controversial issue of what makes a &quot;true&quot; WWE Diva and the theme of the show leading towards a feud between Lee and the cast. At the 2013 Slammy Awards show, the Diva of the Year award was won by Brie and Nikki Bella. On January 8, 2014, Kaitlyn decided to depart from WWE to pursue other endeavors, losing her last match against her former friend and rival Divas Champion AJ Lee. Later on towards the end of the month, AJ Lee became the longest reigning Divas Champion in history, surpassing Maryse&#x27;s reign of 216 days. On the March 12 episode of &quot;Main Event&quot;, Lee successfully defended the Divas Championship against Natalya, in a match that lasted fourteen minutes—the longest women&#x27;s championship match since 1987. On the March 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was announced by Vickie Guerrero that Lee would defend her Divas Championship against the entire Divas roster at WrestleMania XXX, making it the first time the title was defended at WrestleMania. At the event, AJ Lee retained her championship by forcing Naomi to submit.

On the post-WrestleMania episode of &quot;Raw&quot; on April 7, 2014, Paige made her debut on the main roster and defeated AJ Lee for the Divas Championship ending her record reign at 295 days. At the time, Paige was also the reigning (and first) NXT Women&#x27;s Champion, having won the belt on June 20, 2013, after defeating Emma in the tournament finals to crown the inaugural champion. With her Divas Championship win, Paige became the first wrestler to simultaneously hold both titles, as well as becoming the youngest Divas Champion in WWE history at the age of 21. Lana also made her debut as the manager of Rusev, aiding him his first victory on the main roster against Zack Ryder. Shortly after, the duo adopted a Russophillic, anti-American gimmick.

Brie Bella entered a storyline with Stephanie McMahon at Payback — as part of her husband Daniel Bryan&#x27;s storyline with McMahon — McMahon threatened to fire Bella if, an injured, Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to &quot;quit&quot; before slapping McMahon in the face. In mid-June, Vickie Guerrero departed mutually from WWE, after losing to Stephanie McMahon in a pudding match. AJ Lee returned after a two-month hiatus, defeating Paige in an impromptu match to regain the Divas Championship as both then traded the championship until at SummerSlam, then Night of Champions. At SummerSlam, Stephanie McMahon defeated Brie Bella in her first match in ten years, after Nikki Bella attacked her sister. This led to a match between the twins at Hell in a Cell, where the loser was forced to become the winner&#x27;s personal assistant for 30 days, where Nikki defeated Brie. AJ Lee won the Divas Championship for a record-tying third time at Night of Champions against Paige and Nikki Bella. With this win, AJ Lee tied with Eve Torres for the most reigns ever at three.

Nikki Bella received her title match against AJ Lee on November 23 at Survivor Series, which she won, with Brie&#x27;s help, to become a two-time Divas Champion. The duo had reconciled at this point.
=== Divas Revolution (2015–2016) ===

On the February 23, 2015, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Bella Twins faced Paige and Emma in a widely criticized match that lasted around 30 seconds. After the match, a hashtag on Twitter trended worldwide for around a day and a half, called #GiveDivasAChance. This hashtag brought attention to various multi-media outlets over the long-tenured controversy over the company&#x27;s treatment of their women&#x27;s division, including AJ Lee who publicly criticized Stephanie McMahon over the issue. On April 3, five days after Lee and Paige defeated the Bella Twins at WrestleMania 31, WWE announced that Lee decided to retire from in-ring competition and departed from the company. In June, Paige started serving as a judge on the sixth season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, while Renee Young appeared as co-host of the show and Lita served as a coach.

On the July 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nikki Bella claimed that there were no challengers for her championship. As a result, Stephanie McMahon proclaimed a revolution in the women&#x27;s division and introduced Charlotte, Becky Lynch, and the NXT Women&#x27;s Champion Sasha Banks as the newest additions to the main roster. In the following weeks, a three-way feud began between Team B.A.D. (Naomi, Tamina and Sasha Banks), Team Bella (Alicia Fox and The Bella Twins) and Team PCB (Paige, Charlotte, and Becky Lynch), with the latter team being renamed from Submission Sorority due to links to adult content. The three teams faced off at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match, where Becky pinned Brie to win the match for Team PCB.

On July 29, WWE announced that Layla would depart from the company and retire. On the August 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nikki introduced the Bellatron timer which counted down the remaining time until she surpassed the record for the longest-reigning Divas champion of all time. Charlotte won the first Beat the Clock Challenge for a title shot. Her title match with Nikki was initially advertised for Night of Champions, but instead took place the &quot;Raw&quot; preceding the pay-per-view, after Charlotte issued a petition, granted later by The Authority, to face Nikki before she surpassed the record to become the longest-reigning Divas Champion. Charlotte won the match by disqualification when Brie and Nikki switched places and Charlotte pinned Brie. However, since the title could not change hands by disqualification, Nikki retained the championship, and in the process, became the longest-reigning Divas Champion in history, surpassing AJ Lee&#x27;s previous record of 295 days. Several days later, on September 20 at Night of Champions, Nikki lost the championship to Charlotte, ending her reign at 301 days. Shortly after, Nikki went on a hiatus from television due to a neck injury which would require surgery, but returned for one night on December 21, to accept the Slammy Award for Diva of the Year.

=== Women&#x27;s Evolution (2016–present) ===

At WrestleMania 32 in April 2016, WWE announced a major re-launch of its women&#x27;s division: the &quot;Divas&quot; moniker was dropped, with the company now promoting its female talent as &quot;Superstars&quot; as with their male counterparts. Lita made an appearance to unveil a new WWE Women&#x27;s Championship belt; the title, which replaced the WWE Divas Championship, shares its name with the original Women&#x27;s Championship, but does not share the same title history as the original. WWE acknowledges the original championship as its predecessor. Later in the show, Divas champion Charlotte won the new championship by defeating Lynch and Banks.

WWE had faced criticism from critics and performers for having portrayed female wrestlers as a source of sex appeal, rather than showcasing their athletic prowess. Stephanie McMahon explained that the changes were part of a move towards gender equality within the company by dropping the &quot;derogatory&quot; Divas title, and thereby placing its entire roster on a &quot;level playing field&quot; as &quot;Superstars&quot;. In the years that followed the relaunch, the increased prominence of the women&#x27;s division in WWE programming, events, and reality series had helped to, in turn, attract more female viewers to WWE programming; McMahon stated that &quot;Women love action, but I think they also really love the stories. They love the characters, they love the drama. Women need a reason to watch, more so than men I think, so the more you can get your female audience engaged in the character and in the story, then they care. They care about who&#x27;s going to win, they care about who&#x27;s going to lose.&quot;
It was also at the same time that WWE&#x27;s hiring policy regarding female talents changed as independent wrestlers (particularly from the likes of Shimmer, Shine and WSU), mixed-martial artists and athletes have gradually been replacing fitness and swimsuit models due to Triple H replacing John Laurinaitis as WWE&#x27;s Head of Talent. In addition, women began to receive more multi-dimensional characters as well.

In April 2016 at a show in Dubai, Alicia Fox became the first female performer in WWE history to appear in front of a live crowd in the Middle East. After the second brand split and the 2016 WWE draft on July 19, 2016, the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship became exclusive to Raw. The SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship was subsequently unveiled during the August 23, 2016, episode of &quot;SmackDown,&quot; and won by Becky Lynch in a six-way elimination match at Backlash the following month. Throughout 2016, Charlotte Flair (who added her father&#x27;s ring surname to her own ring name) and Sasha Banks feuded over the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship. They main-evented &quot;Raw&quot; on two occasions that year, they competed in the first women&#x27;s Hell in a Cell match in WWE history that same year, marking the first time that a women&#x27;s match had headlined a WWE pay-per-view event.

In 2017 and 2018, WWE also began to promote women&#x27;s Royal Rumble, Money in the Bank, Tables, Ladders, and Chairs, and Elimination Chamber matches for the first time. The inaugural winners of these events were Asuka, Carmella, Asuka once again and Alexa Bliss. On January 28, 2017, WWE announced that Nikki Bella would serve as an executive producer for &quot;Total Divas&quot; starting in the second half of the sixth season in April. Nikki would become the first female talent within the company to become a producer of a WWE-related show. On October 22, 2017, Asuka made her main roster debut at , defeating Emma. Shortly after, WWE announced that Emma and Summer Rae were both released from their respective contracts. On November 20, Paige returned to RAW after a year of inactivity, alongside the debuting Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, attacking Mickie James, Sasha Banks and Bayley. That year, WWE also held an inaugural women&#x27;s tournament, the Mae Young Classic, and signed Jessika Carr as the first woman to be a full-time WWE referee.

Since then, there are generally at least two or more women&#x27;s matches on RAW, SmackDown and NXT while it is increasingly rare for some episodes not to have a women&#x27;s match on the show. In addition, promos and fights involving women have gotten more intense and violent compared to the Divas Era. Also, women&#x27;s storylines began to move away from cattiness and romantic relationships with male wrestlers into more personal feuds as well as animosity between the two wrestlers as they closely begin to mirror men&#x27;s storylines. On August 26, 2018, Rhea Ripley defeated Toni Storm in the United Kingdom Championship Tournament to win the inaugural NXT UK Women&#x27;s Championship, which became the top women&#x27;s championship of the NXT UK brand. On September 11, 2018, Maryse made her first match in over 7 years, facing Brie Bella in a no contest. On October 8, the returning Brie Bella and Nikki Bella attacked the then-Raw Women&#x27;s Champion Ronda Rousey after defeating Ruby Riott, Liv Morgan and Sarah Logan, turning heel in the process and setting up a match for WWE Evolution. Hall of Famers Trish Stratus and Lita also made their return to face Mickie James and Alexa Bliss at the event. In October 2018, WWE hosted Evolution, its first-ever pay-per-view to consist only of women&#x27;s matches. Executive vice president of talent, live events and creative Triple H stated that it &quot;was simply the right time for this to happen&quot;, countering allegations that the event was a counterbalance for the subsequent Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia (where WWE had not held women&#x27;s matches due to the country&#x27;s women&#x27;s rights policies). In December 2018, a new WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship was unveiled; it was contested for the first time at Elimination Chamber in February 2019, and won in a tag team Elimination Chamber match by Sasha Banks and Bayley.
Amid a feud with Charlotte Flair after SummerSlam in 2018, Lynch began to refer to herself as &quot;The Man&quot;—adopting a persona of a poorly-treated underdog. The storyline coincided with a major increase in Lynch&#x27;s popularity, and culminated with Lynch defeating the Raw and SmackDown&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Champions Ronda Rousey and Charlotte Flair in a winner takes all triple threat match at WrestleMania 35—marking the first women&#x27;s main event in WrestleMania history. After 14 years with WWE, veteran wrestler Alicia Fox retired, returning to participate only at Royal Rumble events in the future. At Crown Jewel, Natalya and Lacey Evans competed in WWE&#x27;s first women&#x27;s match in Saudi Arabia. Later that year, Survivor Series held its first ever women&#x27;s main event featuring Raw Women&#x27;s Champion Becky Lynch, SmackDown Women&#x27;s Champion Bayley and NXT Women&#x27;s Champion Shayna Baszler, with the latter winning the match. In 2021, Sasha Banks and Bianca Belair became the first black women to jointly headline WrestleMania.

On January 6, 2021, at the first ever Women&#x27;s Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Tournament was announced by NXT general manager William Regal and on February 14, 2024, in the tournament finals at NXT TakeOver: Vengeance Day the tournament was won by Raquel González and Dakota Kai as they defeated Ember Moon and Shotzi Blackheart. On March 10, 2021, after the tournament victory Raquel González and Dakota Kai were awarded the first ever NXT Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship&#x27;s by NXT general manager William Regal making them the inaugural championship holders.

During the late year of 2021 the first ever WWE Queen&#x27;s Crown tournament was announced, The tournament is a female version of the company&#x27;s King of the Ring tournament. On October 21, 2021, Zelina Vega defeated Doudrop to become the inaugural Queen&#x27;s Crown at Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia.

Also while the name &quot;Diva&quot; largely fell into disuse, the term was then reused in 2022 for NXT wrestler Quincy Eliott&#x27;s moniker, &quot;Super Diva&quot;.

On June 9, 2023, on an episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, the WWE Raw Women&#x27;s Championship name was reverted back to the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship as to when Lita introduced it at WrestleMania 32, and then-current champion Asuka was awarded with a new title belt. On the June 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the WWE Smackdown Women&#x27;s Championship was renamed to the Women&#x27;s World Championship, and then-current champion Rhea Ripley was awarded with the new title belt.

On June 23, 2023, the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship&#x27;s were unified with the NXT Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship&#x27;s as Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler (WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Champions) defeated Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn (NXT Women&#x27;s Tag Team Champions) retiring the NXT Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championships in an episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;.

On July 17, 2023, Chelsea Green and Sonya Deville became the first WWE Tough Enough women contestants to win the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championships in WWE history.

On April 6, 2024, at NXT Stand &amp; Deliver, NXT general manager Ava announced the creation of the NXT Women&#x27;s North American Championship. This is the first-ever secondary women&#x27;s championship in WWE. On April 7, 2024, at WrestleMania XL, the WWE Queen&#x27;s Crown tournament was renamed as the WWE Queen of the Ring tournament. The finals of the tournament took place at King and Queen of the Ring in Saudi Arabia which was won by Nia Jax, earning her a title shot at the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship at SummerSlam.

On June 9, 2024, at NXT Battleground Kelani Jordan became the inaugural NXT Women&#x27;s North American Champion as she defeated Sol Ruca, Lash Legend, Fallon Henley, Jaida Parker and Michin in a 6-Women Ladder match.

On May 1, 2024, WWE Chief Content Officer Paul &quot;Triple H&quot; Levesque confirmed that WWE TV show WWE Speed that was established April 3, 2024, which air&#x27;s on Twitter would also feature women&#x27;s matches; this led to an official announcement on August 9, 2024, where he announced that the tournament for the first ever WWE Speed Women&#x27;s Championship will begin on September 4, 2024. The title is a women&#x27;s version of the WWE Speed Championship which was inauguracely won by Ricochet. In the tournament final that occurred during the &quot;Speed&quot; tapings on October 4, 2024, SmackDown&#x27;s Candice LeRae defeated Raw&#x27;s Iyo Sky to become the inaugural champion.
On the November 8, 2024, episode of SmackDown, SmackDown GM Nick Aldis introduced the WWE Women&#x27;s United States Championship belt. On the November 25, 2024, episodes of RAW, the WWE Women&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship belt was unveiled by RAW GM Adam Pearce. On December 14, 2024 at Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event Chelsea Green was crowned the inaugural WWE Women’s United States Champion when she defeated Michin in the WWE Women’s United States Championship Tournament finals. On the January 13, 2025 episode of Raw Lyra Valkyria defeated Dakota Kai to become the inaugural WWE Women&#x27;s Intercontinental Champion in the tournament finals.

====Reception====
While Stephanie McMahon credited Triple H and Vince McMahon as the creators of the Women&#x27;s Revolution, wrestler Gail Kim countered that Total Nonstop Action Wrestling was the promotion where the Women&#x27;s Revolution began. Former WWE wrestler Maria Kanellis was critical of how WWE portrays women, stating that it feels more like a &quot;promotional tactic&quot;. After being released in 2021, Mickie James said that one WWE executive told her: &quot;Women&#x27;s wrestling doesn&#x27;t make money&quot; in response to her push for a second all-female pay-per-view or an all-female branded show.

== Promotional pushes ==
The popularity of the women of WWE has resulted in various cross-promotions. Various female talent in WWE have posed in &quot;Playboy&quot;, others have appeared in commercials for WWE and non-WWE products as well as men&#x27;s interest magazines.

Women in WWE would participate in annual photoshoots every year, travelling to a foreign destination. The photoshoot would be followed by a magazine, featuring photos from the shoot as well as a television special or video release of highlights from the shoot. The first initial annual photoshoot was in 1999 in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was promoted through video release by WWE entitled &quot;Come Get Some: The Women of the WWF&quot;. Debra, Chyna, Sable, Tori, Jacqueline, Terri Runnels, Ivory, Luna Vachon, and Ryan Shamrock were part of the photoshoot and promotional material.

&quot;Playboy&quot; playmates, such as Carmella DeCesare and Karen McDougal have also appeared in the 2004 Diva Search contest. Former WWE female talent Taryn Terrell and current female talent Maryse have also posed nude for the magazine. Female talents such as Trish Stratus, Lita, Debra, Sharmell, Stacy Keibler, Michelle McCool, and Melina Perez have said that posing for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine is out of the question for them. Trish Stratus appeared on Canadian sports talk show &quot;Off The Record&quot; and said that she did not pose because she wanted to be known as &quot;multiple time Women&#x27;s Champion Trish Stratus&quot; rather than &quot;the girl who posed in &quot;Playboy&quot;&quot;. Stratus also claims that she refused the shoot because she says she can still be sexy without taking her clothes off. Lita has said that she did not pose because she felt it was wrong for her as a role model for young girls to pose for the magazine.

Shortly following Maria&#x27;s pictorial, WWE transitioned to a TV-PG rating and ended its connection to &quot;Playboy&quot; as part of the move.

<text>Leaving Through the Window is the second studio album and major-label debut by American rock band Something Corporate. Following the success of the Drive-Thru Records-released &quot;Audioboxer&quot; (2001) EP, the band signed to their label distributor MCA Records in late 2001 after the EP caught their attention. The three-month recording process for &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; took place in studios across California and Florida, with Jim Wirt acting as producer. A few songs from previous releases were re-recorded for inclusion on the album; the material was anywhere from three months to three years old. A music video was made for &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; in early 2002; the group then embarked on a three-month long US tour.

After the tour, &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; was released jointly by Drive-Thru and MCA Records on May 21. The band performed on the Warped Tour in 2002 and supported New Found Glory once on a European trek and again on a US tour through to the end of the year. A DVD single that featured music videos for &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; and &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; was released during the US leg. They co-headlined a three-month US tour with the Juliana Theory, which coincided with the release of a music video for &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;. It was released as a UK single in early March and was promoted with a tour there; at the end of the month, &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; was released as a single.

&quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; sold 12,000 copies in its first week, charting at number 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the process. It appeared on another &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, Heatseekers Albums, where it reached number one. &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot; and &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; had some success: &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; charted at number 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart and number 68 in the UK; &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot; charted only in the UK at number 33. As of mid-2005, the album&#x27;s sales stood at 291,000 copies. The record received a mixed reception from critics, with negative comments on its length and frontman Andrew McMahon&#x27;s vocals, and positive comments about his musicianship.

==Background==
Something Corporate&#x27;s debut album &quot;Ready... Break&quot; was released through a local concert venue in November 2000. Before vocalist/pianist Andrew McMahon&#x27;s final year of high school, guitarists Josh Partington and Reuben Hernandez left for college. Eventually, the two flew back to play gigs. The group met to discuss their commitment to the band; a portion of their day-job wages was being used to help fund the group. Hernandez left the group to continue his studies and was replaced by William Tell. After finalizing their line-up, the group began performing at local venues, eventually gaining support slots for bands like Better Than Ezra and Sugar Ray. Shortly afterwards, a number of record labels showed an interest in signing the group. House of Blues representative Sean Striegel suggested to independent label Drive-Thru Records that they check out the band while they were in the process of recording the &quot;Audioboxer&quot; EP in June 2001.

Representatives from the label, who saw the group&#x27;s crossover potential, visited McMahon&#x27;s home for a performance in his garage. They stayed for over an hour and a half as the group performed a full set, compared to the 20-minute sets that other labels wanted them to play. The following month, the band signed to Drive-Thru Records, partially because the label liked their ballads. Drive-Thru wanted a minor release to introduce the band, leading to the release of &quot;Audioboxer&quot; in October. KROQ came across the EP and began playing the track &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; later that month. The EP soon caught the attention of major label MCA Records, which had a distribution deal with Drive-Thru that allowed MCA to upstream bands from them. In November and December, the group toured across the US with the likes of Reel Big Fish, Sugarcult and River City High.

==Production==
Pre-production began for &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; on Boxing Day 2001 and wrapped up in early January 2002. Main recording took place between January and March at various studios across the US: Cello Studios in Hollywood, California; 4th Street Recording in Santa Monica, California; South Beach Studios in Miami Beach, Florida; and Jungle Room Studios in Glendale, California. Jim Wirt produced and engineered all the sessions, with additional engineering by Mike Fraser. &quot;Globes &amp; Maps&quot; was engineered by Brian Reeves. PJ Smith, Alan Sanderson and Joel Ausbrooks served as additional engineers. CJ Eiriksson and Patrick Shevelin acted as Pro-Tools engineers. Smith provided background vocals on &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;, &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot;, &quot;The Astronaut&quot;, &quot;Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Straw Dog&quot;, &quot;Drunk Girl&quot; and &quot;Not What It Seems&quot;.

Strings were engineered by Steve Churchyard with assistance from Robert Read. Session musician Patrick Warren contributed chamberlin and organ to &quot;Globes &amp; Maps&quot;. &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot;, both of which featured on the &quot;Audioboxer&quot; EP, were re-recorded for the album as the group wanted to be &quot;happier with their execution&quot;, according to McMahon. Three tracks—&quot;Cavanaugh Park&quot;, &quot;Straw Dog&quot; and &quot;Drunk Girl&quot;—from &quot;Ready... Break&quot; were also re-recorded for the album. On two separate occasions, the piano was tracked in half-time to give it a different sound. Mixing was done by Tom Lord-Alge in April, before being mastered by Stephen Marcussen at Marcussen Mastering in Hollywood.

==Composition and lyrics==
All of the songs on &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; were written by McMahon, with the exception of &quot;Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Fall&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot; which were written by Josh Partington. McMahon found it easier coming up with arrangements on the piano, rather than a guitar, as it seemed a better instrument to expand song structures. The band spent the time required to get the right sound balance between McMahon&#x27;s piano, and Partington and Tell&#x27;s guitars. McMahon reasoned that instruments needed to be at the right place in a song&#x27;s arrangement so they could be &quot;both felt and heard.&quot; &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;, &quot;Cavanaugh Park&quot;, &quot;Straw Dog&quot; and &quot;Globes &amp; Maps&quot; feature string arrangements written by Paul Buckmaster who conducted the 26-piece orchestra that performed them. Partington described the album as a &quot;conglomeration of songs that were anywhere from three months to three years old ... like a greatest hits of our early stuff.&quot; Discussing the album&#x27;s title, McMahon said they wanted a name that was connected to some of the tracks, namely, to two lines in &quot;I Want to Save You&quot;. He added that they lines &quot;kind of reference the kind of getting in and out without being detected so that&#x27;s how we came out with that&quot;.

Musically, the album has been classified as alternative rock, pop punk and power pop. It has been compared to works by bands like Jimmy Eat World, Cheap Trick, Lit, and New Found Glory. Austin Saalman of &quot;Under the Radar&quot; wrote that the album was a &quot;a warm concoction of guitar-heavy pop-punk and emotive piano rock, charmingly complemented by [...] McMahon’s naive boy-next-door lyrical sensitivity&quot;. &quot;I Want to Save You&quot; is a character sketch of a girl who was mistreated by her partner. Discussing &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;, McMahon said he was interested in a girl who liked punk rock music while he was in high school. The song served as a metaphor for what was a frequent discrepancy between the pair, which McMahon described: &quot;She was cooler than I was and she liked punk and I was this, like, squirrely kid in, like, a piano band.&quot; The song had initially began as a ballad.

&quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; was written after the first Something Corporate tour. A day or two after it ended, McMahon sat in his parents&#x27; garage, where his piano was situated and wrote the song around his memories of the tour. They almost named it &quot;I Woke Up in a Van&quot;, but felt that it did not fit as well as car did. The song references a show the band played in Poughkeepsie, New York at The Chance venue, as well as to Rockford, Illinois. &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; was written during McMahon&#x27;s last year in high school, after a guy named Jordan wanted to fight with him over a girl. It is about being bullied and using words to fight back. The track was not initially planned for release on the album and was meant to appear solely on the &quot;Audioboxer&quot; EP. &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; and &quot;If I Were a Terrorist, I&#x27;d Bomb the Graduation&quot; were written during the same period in 6/8 time. The band wanted both tracks to on the EP as an introduction to their music. However, &quot;Terrorist&quot; was left off the release because of the September 11 attacks; the group thought it would be in bad taste to use it. They had been playing the track live for up to six months before the event occurred.

&quot;The Astronaut&quot; was written in the midst of the album&#x27;s recording sessions while Tom Petty was working in the next room. It lyrics reference space travel, which would continue to be an occasional theme in McMahon&#x27;s songwriting. &quot;Hurricane&quot; is credited to Partington, with McMahon contributing three words. When Partington played the track for the band at practice, McMahon was enthusiastic about it. Sean Richardson of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; said Partington&#x27;s lyrical form was &quot;more introspective and harder-hitting than McMahon’s&quot;. McMahon wrote &quot;Cavanaugh Park&quot; while he was 16 or 17; it was named after a recreational area in Lake Forest, California. The park serves as a benchmark for incidents while growing up, like hanging out with friends and getting into trouble. The pop punk track &quot;Fall&quot; is followed by two indie pop songs, &quot;Straw Dog&quot; and &quot;Good News&quot;; the latter two, plus closer &quot;Globes &amp; Maps&quot;, showcased a sound that McMahon would later explore with his solo project Jack&#x27;s Mannequin a few years later.

==Release==
While recording was nearly completed, &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; was gaining traction at popular alternative radio stations. In early February 2002, a music video was filmed for the track at El Segundo High School. It was directed by Richard Reines, who co-founded Drive-Thru Records and filmed over two 14-hour days. It opens with Chris Owen, who acts as Jordan the bully showing up to high school in a Porsche. The band takes musical equipment from the choir room and starts performing in the hallway. It concludes with them hanging out with Summer Altice. On February 25, the group performed the track on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot;. On March 15, the album&#x27;s title &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; was announced; later that day, the group worked on images for the album with photographer Justin Stephens. Between March and May, the group toured across the US. Following this, the group filmed a music video for &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; in Toronto, Canada during an off day in between tours. &quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; was released on May 21, 2002 as a joint release by Drive-Thru and MCA Records. The UK edition, which was released on September 9, included &quot;Little&quot; and &quot;Walking By&quot; (both from &quot;Audioboxer&quot;) as bonus tracks. The artwork stars Sara Pohlman, a 15 year-old model from Tennessee.

Between late June and mid-August, the group went on the Warped Tour (2002). Following this, the group toured across Europe supporting New Found Glory in August and September, before headlining two shows in the UK and four in Japan. &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; was released to Hot AC radio on September 27. In October and November, the band toured across the US alongside New Found Glory, Finch and Further Seems Forever. A DVD single was released on November 5, featuring music videos for &quot;I Woke Up in a Car&quot; and &quot;If You C Jordan&quot;. Following two European shows, the band went on a co-headlining tour of the US with the Juliana Theory between January and March 2003, supported by Vendetta Red, Red West and Fiction Plane. On January 17, a music video was released for &quot;Punk Rock Princess&quot;; it was filmed the previous December in Toronto, Canada. The track was released as a CD single in the UK on March 17 with &quot;Forget December&quot; and &quot;Konstantine&quot; as the B-sides. The latter track was initially planned for inclusion on the album, but was let off as the band thought it did not fit with album&#x27;s flow. In March, the group went on a UK tour with Home Grown and Steel Train. On March 31, &quot;If You C Jordan&quot; was released as a single.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Leaving Through the Window&quot; received mixed response from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson wrote the group&#x27;s style was &quot;punky yet vulnerable and introspective&quot;, with McMahon &quot;anchoring&quot; many of the songs around his piano. He felt it was &quot;among the more memorable and promising alterna-rock efforts of 2002.&quot; &quot;CMJ Music Monthly&quot; writer Michelle Kleinsak said McMahon&#x27;s musicianship on the piano disconnects the group from their emo/punk peers, and helps make their album &quot;such an elegant and confident debut.&quot; &quot;Melodic&quot; reviewer Kaj Roth wrote that the &quot;real nice&quot; record was filled with &quot;loads of catchy tunes&quot; that are &quot;perfect for the radio this hot summer.&quot; Richard Abowitz of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted the band crafted &quot;suburban ennui and high school angst into slick, hummable punk.&quot; He mentioned that McMahon&#x27;s song writing was &quot;the secret weapon,&quot; calling it &quot;derivative, but not boring.&quot; Sputnikmusic emeritus Andrew H. viewed the album as &quot;pretty average&quot;, though he found the lyrics/vocals &quot;really personal&quot;, adding that some listeners would dislike McMahon&#x27;s voice. The staff at &quot;Modern Fix&quot; noted that the keyboard would struggle to compete with the loudness of the guitars and McMahon&#x27;s vocals, while praising their &quot;excellent grasp on constructing songs that have defined parts and movements, flows and sways&quot;.

Punknews.org&#x27;s Scott Heisel opened his review complaining of the record&#x27;s length: &quot;This CD is too fucking long&quot;, before adding that it was &quot;way too long overall. There are too many songs, and each song seems to enjoy sauntering in at around the 4 minute mark&quot;. In spite of this, he said the group seemed &quot;pretty proficient at writing a good pop song&quot; and praised McMahon&#x27;s vocals. Steve Servos of &quot;Chart Attack&quot; claimed the band tried &quot;so hard to be punk ... but fall so far short that when they look around they can’t even see where punk went.&quot; He criticized the album&#x27;s length, wishing the band had left &quot;at least a minute from each song on the studio’s floor, where they belong.&quot; &quot;Ink 19&quot; reviewer Kiran Aditham found McMahon&#x27;s singing &quot;less annoying&quot; compared to the band&#x27;s labelmates New Found Glory. He lambasted the release as being &quot;standard fare&quot; which Weezer had done &quot;much better and more creatively almost a decade ago.&quot; &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; Peter White dismissed the album as an &quot;XFM playlist without the edge&quot; that &quot;makes a mockery of all things beautiful about the joy of discovery and the fun of breathing.&quot;

===Commercial performance and accolades===

<text>Mednoye () is a village in Kalininsky District of Tver Oblast, Russia, located on the Tvertsa River, 28 km west of Tver, by the Moscow–St.Petersburg highway. Population: 3,047 (1992).

Mednoye was first mentioned as a votchina of one of Tver boyars in some documents dating from the 14th century. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the village prospered due to its location on the road leading from Tver to Torzhok and Novgorod. During the Oprichnina, there were 104 households in the village.

In the 19th century, Mednoye was a post station on the route from Moscow to St. Petersburg. One chapter of Alexander Radishchev&#x27;s &quot;Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow&quot; is dedicated specifically to this village.

During World War II Mednoye was a centre of heavy tank fighting (October 1941) which formed part of the Battle of Moscow. It also became known as a NKVD mass execution site. Between April 3 and April 19, 1940, 6,311 Polish officers from the Ostashkov POW camp were brought to the area of Mednoye and subsequently shot to death behind the village of Yamka during the Katyn massacre.

Apart from the Katyn war cemetery, the landmarks of Mednoye include the Church of Our Lady of Kazan (1764), the 18th-century post station, and the memorial house of Sergey Lemeshev.

<doc id="580573" wikidata="Q4127592" url="?curid=580573" title="Soviet Student Olympiads">
<text>Soviet Student Olympiad was an annual set of contests for students in the USSR. There were two separate multi-round competitions every year: for higher education (universities) and general education (starting from 7th to 10th/11th grade). Both competitions had several rounds, and winners from lower rounds would go to the next round. Not only individual members, but teams were awarded too. The main difference between two Olympiads was that the school one had separate threads for every grade, while the university one was for all students.

==Contest format==
Both Olympiads had the same format of the contests. Students would come in teams representing their location, e.g. schools or republics. Each contest could have 2-3 parts. For instance, the Republican round of University Olympiads on physics could have three parts: theory, lab and computer modeling. All students were given the same set of problems to solve. They would work on solutions strictly individually - no teamwork was allowed - and then they were scored by judges. Team scores were simply sum of individual member scores. Earlier rounds could take just one round, while the later rounds could span for a week having several parts.

==Olympiads in schools (general education)==

===Overview ===
Contests were conducted on many subject of Soviet school curriculum such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and others. These Olympiads had several levels based on Soviet Union&#x27;s administrative structure. These were: School, District (&quot;Raion&quot;), City, Regional (&quot;Oblast&quot;), Republican and All-Union contests. These competitions were organized separate for every school grade. Depending on the subject and geographical region the highest round of the Olympiads varied from the All-Union level in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry to the Regional level in some other disciplines.

In addition, at certain time Moscow carried out joint &quot;Olympiads in Linguistics and Mathematics&quot; (Олимпиада по языкознанию и математике). After each such Olympiad its problems were printed in the &quot;Science and Life&quot; (&quot;Наука и Жизнь&quot;) popular science magazine. There were numerous other Olympiads in Moscow including interdisciplinary &quot;Lomonosov tour&quot;.

Besides, there were correspondence Olympiads, in particular, Olympiads carried out by some newspapers, journals and universities. One of the important correspondence Olympiads was organized by the Kvant magazine. Its winners were admitted to the Republican round of the All-Union Physics and Mathematics Olympiads.

Also, there were team contests organized for schools to compete for District, City or Regional honors. There also was a &quot;Physics fight&quot; contest organized by the Moscow State University. In maths, there were contests organized for cities to compete for Republican and All-Union honors.

===School round===
Every school was supposed to have a school round competition. Judges were from subject teachers. The winners from this round could compete in the next round, representing their schools. Each grade could send 3-4 students to the next round. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the school year.

===District (Raion) round===
This round was for schools of the administrative division called &quot;Raion&quot; (district), a district of a larger city or of an oblast. Area rounds were organized by RaiONOs (Russian abbreviation for &quot;District Department of People&#x27;s Education&quot;). Participants would come in teams, but both teams and individual members were recognized and awarded. The winners form teams representing their areas, consisting of 3-4 students from every grade. Usually, area rounds on each subjects took place in different days, so one student could participate in competitions on several subjects. This round was usually conducted in the first half of the school year.

===City round===
This round was for students of the big cities, which had several areas (Raions). The winners from the previous round could participate. City round was organized by GorONO, i.e., City Department of People&#x27;s Education. Again, the winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their city. This round&#x27;s contests on different subjects were conducted on the same day, so a student could compete only in one subject. Depending on a demographic situation, in some places this round was skipped. This round was usually conducted in the first half of the school year.

===Regional (Oblast) round===
This round was for students of the whole region (oblast). The winners from the previous round could participate. Regional round was organized by OblONO, i.e. regional council of education. Again, the winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their region (Oblast). They were joined by the winners of the Kvant magazine competition and of the republican and All-Union olympiads of the previous year. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year.

===Republican round===
This round was a major round, since it recognized the best students of the 15 Republics of the Soviet Union (which are now independent states). The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Republican round was organized by Republican Ministries of Education. The winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their republic. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year. In Russia the competition was conducted separately in four zones and was known as the zonal round. Moscow, Leningrad, a few specialized mathematical schools, and the schools of the transportation ministry system did not compete at the republican level and sent their teams directly to the All-Union round.

===All-Union round===

This round was a final round for Soviet students. It recognized the best students of the Soviet Union in each subject for every grade. In America, it would be on a national level. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. This round was organized by Soviet Ministry of Education. This round was usually conducted at the end of the school year.

===Awards===
The winners were awarded with the diplomas. Material prizes were minor and usually included scientific books that were otherwise difficult to obtain.

===History===

===Notable winners===

Vladimir Drinfeld who was later awarded a 1990 Fields medal for the development of quantum groups is considered by many as the most outstanding &quot;mathematical sportsman&quot; in the history of the All-Union Mathematical Olympiads.
His first scientific publication was based on a generalization of an Olympic problem.
Many other winners of the Mathematical Olympiad became outstanding mathematicians and physicists. Yuri Matiyasevich who solved the 10th Hilbert problem in 1970 was the absolute winner of the 1964 Olympiad.
Grisha Perelman also had an exceptional Olympic record. All three of these national olympiad winners were also selected for the USSR team to the International Mathematical Olympiad and obtained gold medals, with Perelman and Drinfeld achieving perfect scores.

==Olympiads in universities (higher education)==

===Overview ===
Contests were conducted on several subject of Soviet higher education curriculum such as Math, Physics, Programming. These Olympiads had several rounds. The rounds were formed following Soviet Union&#x27;s administrative structure. So, there were University, Republican and All-Union rounds. There was one contest for all students regardless of their year in the university.

===University round===
Every university was supposed to have its own competition. Judges were from faculty staff. The winners from this round could compete in the next round, representing their university. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the school year.

===Republican round===
This round was a major round, since it recognized the best university students in each of the republics. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Teams had up to a dozen students each. Republican round was organized by Republican Ministries of Education. The winners would form a team and take part in the next round representing their republic. This round was usually conducted in the second half of the school year.

===All-Union round===
This round was a final round for Soviet university students. It recognized the best students of the Soviet Union in each subject. In America, it would be on a national level. The winners from the previous round could participate in teams and individually. Teams had 4-5 members. This round was organized by Soviet Ministry of Education. This round was usually conducted in the beginning of the next school year.

===Awards===
The winners were awarded with diplomas and minor material prizes in some cases.

==Moscow Olympiads in Linguistics and Mathematics==
An interesting experiment was olympiads in linguistics and mathematics, at which students were challenged to solve problems in both seemingly non-related domains. It was argued that problems in linguistics often require logical reasoning akin to that required in mathematics. After the olympiads, the problems (and solutions) were published in the &quot;Science and Life&quot; popular science journal.

<doc id="580580" wikidata="Q3304024" url="?curid=580580" title="Shoot (professional wrestling)">
<text>A shoot in professional wrestling is any unplanned, unscripted, or real-life occurrence within a wrestling event. It is a carny term shortened from &quot;straight shooting&quot;, which originally referred to a gun in a carnival target shooting game that did &quot;not&quot; have its sights misaligned. Terminology such as this reflects the professional wrestling industry&#x27;s roots in traveling carnivals.

Initially, the term referred to practice or ability in catch wrestling as a legitimate sport. It has since come to mean any legit attack or fight in professional wrestling regardless of the combat system employed, and its meaning has broadened to include unscripted events in general. The opposite of a shoot is a work or kayfabe. &#x27;Shoot&#x27; may also refer to legitimate &#x27;shooting&#x27; for a takedown, as in interscholastic, amateur, and Olympic wrestling. With professional wrestling&#x27;s history of &#x27;shooters&#x27; and &#x27;hookers&#x27;, wrestlers with elite grappling skills, and the recent rise of shoot style wrestling and mixed martial arts, this use of the term is growing.

==Occurrences==
Professional wrestling is staged entertainment rather than a sports competition. As such, virtually everything in it is worked (part of the show), and shoots rarely occur. Shoots in general are against the nature of the business, similar to an actor ad-libbing or dropping character during a performance. Performers who shoot during a wrestling event are often punished (often by lower pay or relegation to opening bouts) or even fired, since they cannot be relied on to act according to the bookers&#x27; wishes. Shoots can also occur when wrestlers stop cooperating in a match. This may occur to teach one of the wrestlers &quot;a lesson&quot; for whatever reason, or if a wrestler has an issue with the promoter and intentionally makes the match look bad.

===Fan interference===
While the term technically applies only to wrestling performers, crowds also cause shoots by interfering in events, usually by assaulting or attempting to assault a wrestler. Fan interference and violence was prevalent in the northeastern and southern United States from the mid to late 20th century, where many wrestling territories became known for offering violent action to a rabid, fiercely loyal audience which largely believed in what it was seeing.

In 1988, during a steel cage match between &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage and &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, a fan jumped the guardrail during a tense moment in the match. DiBiase, recalling the incident in his autobiography, yelled for Virgil (DiBiase&#x27;s bodyguard, who was attempting to interfere in the match) to knock the man down, which he did, before security led the suspect away as the match played out as intended (Savage knocking the heads of DiBiase and Virgil together before escaping the cage).

In 2002, during a ladder match between Eddie Guerrero and Rob Van Dam, a fan jumped the guardrail, got into the ring, and knocked over the ladder while Guerrero was climbing it. Guerrero noticed what was going on, landed on his feet, and kicked the fan a few times before security took him away.

During a match with Bray Wyatt at a WWE house show in Victoria, British Columbia in August 2015, Roman Reigns was struck in the head by a metal replica Money in the Bank briefcase thrown by a fan. Reigns was momentarily dazed by the incident, but was able to continue the match.

===Worked shoots===
Worked shoot is the term for any occurrence that is scripted by the creative team to come off as unscripted and therefore appear as though it were a real-life happening but is, in fact, still part of the show. This can be seen as an example of the writers breaking the fourth wall and attempting to court the fans who are interested in shoots (i.e., events outside the traditional in-ring wrestling matchups). Notable characteristics of a worked-shoot include the mentioning of terms and information generally known only to industry insiders and &quot;smart&quot; fans. This community of &quot;smart&quot; pro-wrestling fans are sometimes referred to as &quot;smarks&quot;.

A major example of a worked shoot occurred on the June 27, 2011 &quot;Raw Roulette&quot;, where CM Punk delivered a promo popularly known as a &quot;pipebomb&quot; promo. In it, Punk aired his grievances with WWE at the time and announced he would leave the promotion three weeks after his promo with the WWE Championship (Punk would sign a new contract during the time period); the promo was not cut off until Punk attempted to mention bullying issues within the company. In order to provide an air of legitimacy, Punk received a kayfabe suspension from the company following the promo.

==Shoot interview==
A &quot;shoot interview&quot; is generally conducted and released by someone other than a wrestling promotion. They are conducted out of character with a wrestler, promoter, manager, or other insider generally being interviewed about their career and asked to give their opinion on wrestlers, promotions, or specific events in their past. While some wrestlers used these as an opportunity to insult people or promotions they dislike, many are more pleasant. These shoots are often released on DVD, end up on YouTube or other video sharing websites, or as a part of a wrestling podcast.

While shoot interviews generally occur outside a show, one rare example of a shoot interview &quot;during&quot; a televised show occurred on October 23, 1999, when Doug Gilbert, then with the Memphis independent promotion Power Pro Wrestling, turned a televised interview intended to further a feud with Brian Christopher into a shoot that soon led to the demise of the promotion. Gilbert publicly exposed the fact that Jerry Lawler, previously the owner of the USWA, another significant Memphis-based promotion, was Brian&#x27;s father—a blatant violation of kayfabe, the portrayal of events within professional wrestling as not being staged (in this case, Brian &quot;not&quot; being Jerry&#x27;s son). He also made disparaging remarks about both Lawlers, as well as the promotion&#x27;s booker Randy Hales.

==Shoot fighting==
Drawing from this related term, a shooter or shoot-fighter is not a wrestler with a reputation for being uncooperative but one who has legit hooking skills in their repertoire. These wrestlers often gain their skills from martial arts (Ken Shamrock or Josh Barnett), catch wrestling (Lou Thesz or Billy Robinson) or amateur wrestling (Kurt Angle or Brock Lesnar). These kinds of shooters are sometimes referred to as &quot;stretchers&quot; (from their ability to use legitimate holds on their opponents to &quot;stretch&quot; them).

Despite the worked nature of the spectacle, shooters have been around since the beginning. Originally, the National Wrestling Alliance&#x27;s World Champion was typically a shooter or &quot;hooker&quot; in an effort to keep regional champions and other contenders from attempting to shoot on them and win the title when they were not scheduled to do so.

The use of the term &quot;shoot&quot; to describe a single or double-leg takedown attempt (in legit fighting situations such as mixed martial arts) is inspired by early professional wrestling shooters, who would often utilize these basic wrestling moves when shooting on an opponent (as opposed to the flashier takedowns used in worked matches, such as suplexes).

An example of shoot fighting happened on the November 4, 2004, episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, taped in St. Louis, Missouri. During an unscripted segment of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, Kurt Angle, a former American amateur wrestler and 1996 Olympic gold medalist, challenged the finalists to a squat thrust competition. Chris Nawrocki won the competition, and the prize Nawrocki won was a match against Angle. Angle quickly took Nawrocki down with a guillotine choke, but Nawrocki managed to make it to the ropes, forcing Angle to break the hold. Angle then took Nawrocki down with a double leg takedown, breaking his ribs. Angle locked another guillotine choke on Nawrocki, pinning him in the process. After Angle defeated Nawrocki, Angle challenged the other finalists. Daniel Puder, an American professional mixed martial artist, accepted Angle&#x27;s challenge. Angle and Puder wrestled for position, with Angle taking Puder down; however, in the process, Puder locked Angle in a &quot;kimura lock&quot;. With Puder on his back and Angle&#x27;s arm locked in the &quot;kimura&quot;, Angle pushed Puder&#x27;s shoulders down, pinning him. One of the two referees in the ring, Jim Korderas, quickly counted three to end the bout, despite the fact that Puder&#x27;s shoulders were not fully down on the mat, bridging up at two. Puder later claimed he would have snapped Angle&#x27;s arm on national television if Korderas had not ended the match. Dave Meltzer and Dave Scherer gave these following comments:

The term is also often used by wrestling fans, in another definition (in this case, also known as shoot wrestling) to refer to mixed martial arts competitions, which, while superficially similar to wrestling matches, are actual athletic competition rather than sports entertainment.

==Other shoots==
Example of spontaneous events that are not shoots include mistakes by wrestlers (these are known as botches) or matches where the wrestlers are good enough to not need to plan and rehearse beforehand. In such matches the wrestlers go into the match with only the length of the match and what the result should be, and work with each other off instinct and experience, often by &quot;calling spots&quot; in a voice low enough the crowd cannot hear until they reach the finish. The job of the referee will usually involve reminding them of time limits and often calling for the match to &quot;go home&quot; to the intended ending. Another way a referee may be involved is if there is an injury, or one of the wrestlers fails to respond to a 10 count or a pin. In some promotions referees are instructed to adjudicate regardless of the intended finish, resulting in a shoot ending with an &quot;incorrect&quot; winner, or one where the match finish is different.

Shoots may also involve those outside the wrestling business. In 1984, while filming a &quot;20/20&quot; segment on professional wrestling, reporter John Stossel remarked to wrestler David &quot;Dr. D&quot; Schultz that wrestling was fake. Yelling &quot;You think this is fake?&quot;, Schultz slapped him and knocked him to the ground twice. Stossel claimed that he still suffered from pain and buzzing in his ears eight weeks after the assault. Schultz maintains that he attacked Stossel because WWF owner Vince McMahon wanted him to.

TNA Victory Road (2011) ended with a shoot incident. Jeff Hardy was scheduled to challenge Sting for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but a heavily intoxicated Hardy had been in hiding for the duration of the event, arriving late and in doing so he evaded management before making his entrance into the arena and ring. Referee Brian Hebner quickly realised that Hardy was not in proper condition to wrestle and threw up the X sign prior to the match starting. This caused an on-screen intervention from &quot;general manager&quot; Eric Bischoff and an instruction from Bischoff to Sting to immediately and legitimately pin Hardy. After a tie-up and a handful of punches, Sting performed his finisher on Hardy. Hardy did not understand what was happening and attempted but failed to kick-out with Sting holding down the pin, with Hardy losing the match in only a few minutes.

<doc id="580581" wikidata="Q4818290" url="?curid=580581" title="Aṭṭhakavagga and Pārāyanavagga">
<text>The Aṭṭhakavagga (Pali, &quot;Octet Chapter&quot;) and the Pārāyanavagga (Pali, &quot;Way to the Far Shore Chapter&quot;) are two small collections of suttas within the Pāli Canon of Theravada Buddhism. They are among the earliest existing Buddhist literature, and place considerable emphasis on the rejection of, or non-attachment to, all views.

==Textual concerns==

===Position within the Sutta Pitaka===
The &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot; are two small collections of suttas. They are incorporated in the &quot;Khuddhaka Nikāya&quot; as subdivisions of the &quot;Sutta Nipāta&quot;, the collection of the words spoken by the Buddha. The suttas portray the &quot;Aṭṭhakavagga&quot; as some of the Buddha&#x27;s first sermons; the Udana depicts the Buddha asking a monk to recite Dhamma, and responding approvingly when he recites the &quot;Aṭṭhakavagga&quot;.

===Dating===
Some scholars regard the &#x27; and the &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot; as being considerably earlier in composition than the bulk of the canon, and as revealing an earlier form of Buddhism. They are regarded as earlier because of elements of language and composition, their inclusion in very early commentaries, and also because some have seen them as expressing versions of certain Buddhist beliefs that are different from, and perhaps prior to, their later codified versions. In this thinking, the &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot; is somewhat closer to the later tradition than the &#x27;. The &quot;Khaggavisānasutta&quot; (Rhinoceros Sutra), also in the &quot;Sutta Nipāta&quot;, similarly seems to reveal an earlier mode of Buddhist monasticism, which emphasized individual wandering monastics, more in keeping with the Indian sannyāsin tradition.

In 1994, a group of texts which are among the earliest Indian manuscripts discovered were found in Gandhara. These texts include a relatively complete version of the &quot;Rhinoceros Sutra&quot; and textual material from the &quot;&quot; and &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot;.

==Interpretations==
Speaking generally, the &#x27; and the &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot; tend more strongly to emphasize the negative (i.e. those of abstention) sides of asceticism, and show a strong concern with letting go of views, regulating everyday bodily activities, and sexual desires. The Atthakavagga does not give a clear-cut goal such as nirvana, but describes the ideal person. This ideal person is especially characterized by &quot;suddhi&quot; (purity) and &quot;santi&quot; (calmness). The &#x27; also places considerable emphasis on the rejection of, or non-attachment to, all views, and is reluctant to put forward positions of their own regarding basic metaphysical issues.

===Pre-Buddhist or proto-Madhyamaka===
Gomez compared them to later Madhyamaka philosophy, which in its  form especially makes a method of rejecting others&#x27; views rather than proposing its own.

===Interpretation as heterodox===
Tillman Vetter, although agreeing overall with Gomez&#x27;s observations, suggests some refinements on historical and doctrinal grounds. First, he notes that neither of these short collections of suttas are homogeneous and hence are not all amenable to Gomez&#x27; proposals. According to Vetter, those suttas which do lend support to Gomez probably originated with a heterodox ascetic group that pre-dated the Buddha, and were integrated into the Buddhist Sangha at an early date, bringing with them some suttas that were already in existence and also composing further suttas in which they tried to combine their own teachings with those of the Buddha.

===Interpretation as orthodox===
Paul Fuller has rejected the arguments of Gomez and Vetter. He finds that 
Fuller states that in the Nikayas, right-view includes non-dependence on knowledge and views, and mentions the Buddha&#x27;s simile of his dhamma as a raft that must be abandoned. He finds that the Atthakavagga&#x27;s treatment of knowledge and wisdom is parallel to the later Patthana&#x27;s apparent criticism of giving, holding the precepts, the duty of observance, and practicing the jhanas. In his view, both texts exhibit this particular approach not as an attack on practice or knowledge, but to point out that attachment to the path is destructive. Similarly, the text&#x27;s treatment of concentration meditation is intended to warn against attachment to insight, and communicate that insight into the nature of things necessarily involves a calm mind.

Alexander Wynne also rejects both of Vetter&#x27;s claims that the Parayanavagga shows a chronological stratification, and a different attitude toward mindfulness and liberating insight than do other works.

===Theravada interpretation===
The Theravada tradition has taken the view that the text&#x27;s statements, including many which are clearly intended to be paradoxical, are meant to be puzzled over and explicated. An extended commentary attributed to Sariputta, entitled the Mahaniddesa, was included in the Canon. It seeks to reconcile the content of the poems with the teachings in the rest of the discourses. In some cases, the Theravada commentaries blunt or negate the rejection of all views by suggestion that the views being rejected are non-Buddhist views, while affirming the necessity of the views of the Eightfold Path.

<text>Seminiferous tubules are located within the testicles, and are the specific location of meiosis, and the subsequent creation of male gametes, namely spermatozoa.

==Structure==
The epithelium of the tubule consists of a type of sustentacular cells known as Sertoli cells, which are tall, columnar type cells that line the tubule.

In between the Sertoli cells are spermatogenic cells, which differentiate through meiosis to sperm cells. Sertoli cells function to nourish the developing sperm cells. They secrete androgen-binding protein, a binding protein which increases the concentration of testosterone.

There are two types: convoluted and straight, convoluted toward the lateral side, and straight as the tubule comes medially to form ducts that will exit the testis.

The seminiferous tubules are formed from the testis cords that develop from the primitive gonadal cords, formed from the gonadal ridge.

==Function==

Spermatogenesis, the process for producing spermatozoa, takes place in the seminiferous tubules. During spermatogenesis, the DNA of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules is subject to damage from such sources as reactive oxygen species. The genomic integrity of spermatogenic cells is protected by DNA repair processes. Deficiencies in the enzymes employed in these repair processes may lead to infertility.

<text>This is a list of [[airport]]s in the [[Netherlands]], grouped by type and sorted by location.

The largest airport by far is Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, which is the third largest in Europe. Smaller airports with scheduled passenger service are Rotterdam The Hague Airport (formerly known as Zestienhoven), Groningen Airport Eelde, Eindhoven Airport and Maastricht Aachen Airport. De Peel, Valkenburg and Soesterberg have been closed as military airports and are now mainly used by gliders. The future of the former military airport, Twente, is uncertain.

Rarely used helipads without an ICAO indicator, offshore oilrigs and small glider fields are not included in this list. Medical helipads have been assigned the identification codes EH0001 to EH0031 by the Dutch authorities, but these are not official ICAO indicators and thus these helipads are not included in this list. The Maasvlakte and IJmuiden helipads are restricted to maritime piloting services and are not connected to the AFTN network. Air Operations Control Station Nieuw-Milligen is a military air traffic control centre and has a single helipad for military use.

After the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles the airports on Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius became a part of the Netherlands, however they use the TN prefix instead of EH which is used for other Dutch airports.


== Airports ==

ICAO location indicators are linked to the airport&#x27;s Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) from AIS the Netherlands.

Airport names shown in bold indicate the airport is used by scheduled airlines.

<text>Peter Mitchell (January 4, 1824 – October 25, 1899) was a Canadian lawyer, shipbuilder, and politician from New Brunswick, and a Father of Confederation. He was the sixth and last Premier of the Colony of New Brunswick before Canadian Confederation in 1867. After confederation, Mitchell represented New Brunswick in the Senate of Canada as a Liberal until his resignation in 1872 to serve as a member of the Parliament of Canada representing Northumberland as an Independent; he described himself as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; during this time.

==Early life and education==
Peter Mitchell was born on January 4, 1824, in Newcastle (present-day Miramichi), New Brunswick, to Scottish-born immigrant parents. His father was also named Peter Mitchell, and his mother&#x27;s name was Barbara Grant. He was educated at a local grammar school and afterwards spent four years working for George Kerr&#x27;s law office. He became an attorney on October 14, 1847.

==Career==
Mitchell joined a legal partnership with John Mercer Johnson in October 1847, with both practicing law in their respective locations. On October 7, 1849, Mitchell was called to the bar of New Brunswick. Mitchell&#x27;s partnership with Johnson later ended in 1852, as Mitchell sought to pursue himself in the lumbering and shipbuilding business, later entering a shipbuilding partnership with John Haws, a relative of his wife, the following year. The two built a minimum of 12 vessels throughout their partnership, which lasted until 1861.

Mitchell ran again in 1856 as an opponent of Prohibition, which had been proposed by the government. He carried a pistol for protection during the campaign and rum for his supporters. He was successful in this election. In the legislature, Mitchell opposed denominational schools and supported the creation of municipal government. He became a member of the Executive Council in 1859, and introduced the colony&#x27;s first bankruptcy act in order to make things easier for debtors.
Mitchell did not run for re-election in 1861, but was soon appointed to the Legislative Council of New Brunswick (the colony&#x27;s upper house) and rejoined the Executive Council.

While attending the Quebec Conference of 1864, Peter Mitchell was a strong supporter of Canadian Confederation. He resigned from the Executive Council in 1865 when the pro-Confederation government of Samuel Leonard Tilley was defeated, and helped lieutenant-governor Arthur Hamilton Gordon force the resignation of the anti-Confederation government of Albert James Smith in 1866. Gordon appointed Mitchell as the new premier. Mitchell asked Gordon to call an election, and he and his Confederation Party were returned with a majority that approved the participation of the colony in the Canadian Confederation in 1867. 

Mitchell attended the London Conference, which drafted the British North America Act. He was appointed to the new Senate of Canada for its inaugural session in July 1867. Mitchell became a member of Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s first cabinet as minister of marine and fisheries. He was an aggressive defender of Canadian interests, and contested foreign fishing in Canadian waters to the extent of using gunboats to seize American vessels. 

Mitchell resigned from the Senate in 1872 to run for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada where he felt he would have more influence. He was acclaimed in a by-election, but in 1873 the Macdonald government fell due to the Pacific Scandal. Mitchell abandoned the Liberal-Conservative Party of Macdonald and declared himself an independent Member of Parliament (MP). He had little influence as an independent and was distrusted by both Conservatives and Liberals.

Mitchell resigned his seat in 1878 after being accused of violating the Independence of Parliament Act by leasing a building to the government while he was a senator. He re-offered in the subsequent by-election and was returned to parliament.

He ran in the 1878 federal election as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; who supported Macdonald&#x27;s National Policy. Mitchell was defeated by independent candidate Jabez Bunting Snowball.

Mitchell returned to the Commons in the 1882 election and was re-elected in the 1887 election as an independent Liberal, but was defeated in the 1891 election.

In 1885, Mitchell purchased the &quot;Montreal Herald and Daily Commercial Gazette&quot;, and used it to attack the policies of both Liberals and Conservatives. He also called for mercy for Louis Riel, and blamed Macdonald for causing the Riel Rebellion by not dealing with Métis complaints.
He became a supporter of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and ran as a Liberal in the 1896 election but lost.
Laurier made him general inspector of fisheries for Quebec and the Maritime provinces, and Mitchell held that position until his death in 1899.

In July 1899, as he was leaving the parliamentary buildings, Ottawa, he was stricken by paralysis. He seemed to recover, but on 25 October 1899, he was found dead in his rooms in the Windsor Hotel, Montreal.

==Family==
In 1853, he married Isabella Gough, a widow from St. John, New Brunswick. They had one daughter together before Isabella died in 1889. His nephew was Charles R. Mitchell a former provincial Cabinet Minister and leader of the Alberta Liberal Party.
