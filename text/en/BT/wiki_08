<text>TNT is an Australian TV station based in Launceston, Tasmania, owned by Australian Digital Holdings. Originally broadcasting to northern Tasmania, it has broadcast to the whole of Tasmania since aggregation of the Tasmanian television market in 1994.

==History==
TNT-9 was founded as Northern TV Ltd and broadcast in Launceston and Northern Tasmania; the first day of operation was on 26 May. In 1965, TNT-9 became a part of ENT Ltd (Examiner-Northern TV Ltd).

By 1980, TNT-9 adopted a custom version of the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;9 Dots&quot; logo. ENT bought TVT-6 in Hobart in 1982 and in 1985, TNT and TVT were officially relaunched as &quot;TasTV&quot;, with the callsigns remaining for both stations.

On 30 March 1988, ENT sold TNT-9 to Tricom Corporation, the second largest regional television broadcaster in Australia at the time, for $40 million, after buying a parcel worth 19.9% in shares. Under aggregation laws, ENT had to sell one of its two stations to a suitor of its choice by 1992. Ahead of the separation, TNT opened relay station TNT-8 in King Island on 9 September 1988, Tricom was rebranded Southern Cross Broadcasting; the station became known on-air as &quot;Southern Cross Network&quot; from 1 January 1989.

Federal aggregation caused Southern Cross Television to broadcast in Hobart while TasTV, later renamed WIN Television, started broadcasting to Launceston. With both stations carried statewide, both Southern Cross and TasTV/WIN were now competing against each other. In 1999, Southern Cross Tasmania, while still a part of Southern Cross Broadcasting, changed its logo independently of Southern Cross stations on the mainland, adopting a representation of the Tasmanian tiger.

Southern Cross and WIN Television launched Tasmanian Digital Television on 23 December 2003, a jointly owned digital-only commercial station based in Hobart relaying Network Ten content.

On 17 July 2005, Southern Cross Broadcasting adopted a new uniform logo for all stations it owned. Southern Cross Tasmania lost its Tasmanian Tiger logo to a unified corporate Southern Cross logo. 

Southern Cross Tasmania became &quot;Seven Tasmania&quot; in June 2018 as local branding was replaced by network branding.

In February 2025, Southern Cross Austero announced the sale of its remaining television assets, including 7 Tasmania to conservative media outlet Australian Digital Holdings.

==Local programming==
TNT produces the market&#x27;s number one news bulletin daily plus local lifestyle and sports programming.

Previous local programmes produced by TNT-9 include &quot;Sports Club&quot; (weekly sports review), &quot;Quiz Quest&quot; (children&#x27;s game show), &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot; (variety), &quot;Down the Line&quot; (morning talk/local events), &quot;The Saturday Morning Fun Show&quot; (kids), &quot;Tasmanian New Faces&quot; (talent) and annual coverage of &quot;Targa Tasmania&quot; and &quot;The Launceston Cup&quot;.

===News===
The station produces its flagship news program, &quot;Nightly News&quot; (formerly &quot;Southern Cross News&quot;), broadcast live every night at 6:00pm and presented from the Hobart studios. Short news updates are also produced and broadcast throughout the day alongside the national Seven News Updates. The bulletin is consistently the highest rating television program in Tasmania. A shortened version of the day&#x27;s bulletin is upload by the station&#x27;s YouTube channel, featuring only local news and sport reports alongside weather forecasts.

The station originally planned to retitle the bulletin &quot;Seven News Tasmania&quot; on 1 July 2018 to coincide with the station&#x27;s rebrand as Seven Tasmania. But the relaunch was delayed without any notice given. When asked by ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot;, the CEO of SCA Grant Blackley stated that the Seven Network did not want their name featured on any output they do not control, so SCA was coming up with a new brand. On 3 December 2018, the bulletin changed its title to &quot;Nightly News&quot;, a brand the station formerly used from the 1990s up to the early 2000s.

Outside of this bulletin, Seven Tasmania airs national news and current affairs output from the Seven Network, including:
*&quot;Sunrise&quot; 
*&quot;Weekend Sunrise&quot;
*&quot;The Morning Show&quot;
*&quot;Seven News&quot; (Sunrise Early News, National News At Noon, Afternoon News at 4, Weekend Afternoon News at 5, The Latest)

TNT simulcasts the weekday edition of &quot;Seven News at 4&quot; from HSV-7 in Melbourne, along with &quot;Seven’s National News At Noon&quot; at 12.00 on weekdays and &quot;Seven News at 5&quot; on weekends from ATN-7 in Sydney.

====Burnie Ten – Ten Week Challenge====
For the ten weeks leading up to the Burnie Ten, Mark Connelly trains a group of people in a program sponsored by Seven Tasmania. Weekly updates are broadcast during commercial breaks. In the early years of the program, people who took part were well known in Tasmania, however in 2006, a Launceston family were trained to run the event.

==Sports coverage==
Seven Tasmania airs sports coverage from Seven Network, which includes Australian Rules Football, Horse racing, cricket, tennis, golf and motorsport. In the 1990s, the station aired Network Ten&#x27;s daily sports program Sports Tonight as part of its dual-affiliation, however this was eventually replaced by Seven&#x27;s current affairs program, Today Tonight.

The station airs three AFL games per round courtesy of its affiliation with Seven. Matches held in Tasmania are broadcast on delay. The station promotes extensive coverage of Tasmanian sports in its news coverage including cricket, athletics, netball and basketball. The station&#x27;s previous sports reporters were Chris Rowbottom, Alicia Muling, and Trent Dann.

===Local sport===
Locally, coverage of the international road race Targa Tasmania is produced and aired each year. The station also produces live coverage of the Launceston and Hobart Cup. Regular updates on the annual Boxing Day Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race are broadcast during the duration of the race.

==Affiliation==
The station is affiliated with the metropolitan Seven Network and also broadcasts most of Seven&#x27;s sub-channels (7TWO, 7mate, SBN, and Racing.com). Rival Tasmanian stations TVT-6 (WIN Television) is affiliated with the metropolitan Nine Network and the jointly-owned TDT is affiliated with the metropolitan Network 10.

Following aggregation in 1994, the station was a combined Seven and Ten affiliate, however the Ten content was gradually removed from the schedule in the late 2000s following the launch of digital-only station TDT in 2003. TDT is a joint-venture between Southern Cross Austereo and WIN.

<text>Christopher Charles Norris (born 6 November 1947) is a British philosopher and literary critic.

==Career==

Norris completed his PhD in English at University College London in 1975. After an early career in literary and music criticism (during the late 1970s, he wrote for the now-defunct magazine &quot;Records and Recording&quot;), Norris moved in 1991 to the Cardiff Philosophy Department. In 1997, he was awarded the title of Distinguished Research Professor in the Cardiff School of English, Communication &amp; Philosophy. He has also held fellowships and visiting appointments at a number of institutions, including the University of California, Berkeley, the City University of New York, Aarhus University, and Dartmouth College.

He is one of the world&#x27;s leading scholars on deconstruction, and the work of Jacques Derrida. He has written numerous books and papers on literary theory, continental philosophy, philosophy of music, philosophy of language and philosophy of science. More recently, he has been focussing on the work of Alain Badiou in relation with both the analytic tradition (particularly analytic philosophy of mathematics) and with the philosophy of Derrida.

<text>Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm. It is notable for its exceptionally poor time complexity of formula_1 = formula_2
The algorithm&#x27;s running time is thus slower compared to reasonable sorting algorithms, and is slower than bubble sort, a canonical example of a fairly inefficient sort. It is, however, more efficient than Slowsort. The name comes from The Three Stooges.

The algorithm is defined as follows:
* If the value at the start is larger than the value at the end, swap them.
* If there are three or more elements in the list, then:
** Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list
** Stooge sort the final 2/3 of the list
** Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list again

It is important to get the integer sort size used in the recursive calls by rounding the 2/3 &quot;upwards&quot;, e.g. rounding 2/3 of 5 should give 4 rather than 3, as otherwise the sort can fail on certain data.

==Implementation==
=== Pseudocode ===

 function stoogesort(array L, i = 0, j = length(L)-1){
 if L[i] &gt; L[j] then // If the leftmost element is larger than the rightmost element
 swap(L[i],L[j]) // Then swap them
 if (j - i + 1) &gt; 2 then // If there are at least 3 elements in the array
 t = floor((j - i + 1) / 3)
 stoogesort(L, i, j-t) // Sort the first 2/3 of the array
 stoogesort(L, i+t, j) // Sort the last 2/3 of the array
 stoogesort(L, i, j-t) // Sort the first 2/3 of the array again
 return L


=== Haskell ===

-- Not the best but equal to above 

stoogesort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
stoogesort [] = []
stoogesort src = innerStoogesort src 0 ((length src) - 1)

 src&quot;&#x27; = innerStoogesort src&quot; (i + t) j
 src&#x27; = innerStoogesort src i (j - t)

<doc id="563665" wikidata="Q4934503" url="?curid=563665" title="Bob and George">
<text>Bob and George was a sprite-based webcomic which parodied the fictional universe of &quot;Mega Man&quot;. It was written by David Anez, who was a physics instructor living in the American Midwest at the time. The comic first appeared on April 1, 2000, and ran until July 28, 2007. It was updated daily, with there being only 29 days without a comic in its seven years of production and with 2568 comics being made altogether.

Most &quot;Bob and George&quot; strips are still images. The initial strips were mostly done in GIF format (occasionally using JPEG for more graphic-intensive comics) before converting to PNG in May 2004. In addition, occasional comics are animated using either animated GIFs or Macromedia Flash. Some of the Flash comics have the characters speaking, voiced by Anez and others (often forum members). Animated comics are generally used for the annual week-long anniversary parties (usually culminating in a brief animated comic that recaps the events of the past year in a matter of seconds), for especially climactic scenes, and for a series of videos depicting an in-comic event known as &quot;the Cataclysm&quot;.

The comic&#x27;s plot is mostly made up of story arcs of varying lengths. Amongst past story arcs there have been retellings of various Mega Man games (which often play out quite differently from the originals), as well as battles against powerful foes. In addition, many of the story arcs involve time travel, dimensional travel, and villains who want to kill all the characters.

==History==

&quot;Bob and George&quot; was originally planned to be a hand-drawn webcomic about the college adventures of the two titular brothers. Slated to start on April 1, 2000, the plan fell through because Anez did not have a scanner with which to scan his drawings. He stated &quot;I was hoping to use my friend&#x27;s scanner, but he was never around.&quot; He instead released a sequence of filler comics using Mega Man sprites, which he intended to be a temporary measure until he gained access to a scanner, at which point he would implement his initial plan involving the hand drawn comics. He eventually purchased a scanner, and on June 1 he released the hand-drawn comic.

The hand-drawn comic was to revolve around a group of superheroes attending college. Neither the initial attempt nor a later attempt at it went well, and both times he returned to the Mega Man sprite comic. Anez has stated that he hated the hand-drawn comic. The hand-drawn comic made something of a return in the storyline &quot;All Good Things&quot;—the hand-drawn format is used to represent George&#x27;s home dimension, though this time drawn by Liss, Dave&#x27;s wife. Dave stated the reason for this is he realized that he still could not draw, and was not going to get any better.

However, this meant that the comic strip was titled &quot;Bob and George&quot;, but did not contain any characters named &quot;Bob&quot; or &quot;George&quot;. This was fixed with the introduction of sprite versions of the two characters into the comic. Bob is depicted as a gray Proto Man recolor while George is a Mega Man recolor with blond hair and no helmet.

David planned to end the comic by April 1, 2007, which is the end of the seventh year of the comic&#x27;s run. However, the story took longer than expected, and the comic ended on Anez&#x27;s birthday, July 28, 2007. There were a total of 2,658 daily comics produced.

==Significance==
While not the first webcomic to ever use video game sprites in place of hand-drawn art, &quot;Bob and George&quot; is noted as being the first sprite comic to gain widespread popularity and the originator of the sprite comic &quot;craze&quot;. At the height of its readership in 2004, Bob and George held an Alexa traffic rank of around 20,000. Anez&#x27;s comic &quot;paved the way&quot; for the creation of numerous other sprite comics, including &quot;Oldskooled&quot;, &quot;Life of Wily&quot;, and Brian Clevinger&#x27;s 8-Bit Theater. Clevinger has called Anez &quot;the Father of Sprite Comics&quot; for his role in popularizing the phenomenon, and directly credits a friend showing him Anez&#x27;s Bob and George for his inspiration to make his comic. Regarding the use of sprites in a comic, Clevinger has said,

==Cast==

&quot;Bob and George&quot; has a large cast of characters consisting of characters from the Mega Man series of games, as well as original characters created by Anez and others.
* Mega Man – the robotic protagonist of the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; video game series.
* The Author – the (nearly) all-powerful being who creates the comic. He appears as a blue/purple palette swap of Mega Man without his helmet. Alternate versions of The Author, such as &quot;The Helmeted Author&quot; and &quot;The Shadowy Author&quot;, appear in &quot;Bob and George&quot; as antagonists.
* Bob – the younger, evil, and more mature brother of George. His alter-ego is Napalm, a super-powered being with control over fire. He is very adept at programming. He is a grey palette swap of Proto Man, with red hair underneath his helmet. His abilities in combat and his intelligence surpass most of the other characters, to the point he&#x27;s referred to himself as a Mary Sue.
* George – heroic where his younger brother Bob is villainous. His alter-ego is Blitz, a super hero with control over lightning. George is a light blue and grey palette swap of helmet-less Mega Man with flat, blonde hair.

Other characters featured in &quot;Bob and George&quot; include Proto Man, Dr. Light, Roll, and Bass. &quot;Mega Man&quot; characters such as Dr. Wily, X, and Zero are featured in &quot;Bob and George&quot; as villains and adversaries.

==Storyline==
The plot of Bob and George involves various re-tellings of the plot from the &quot;Mega Man&quot; video games, interspersed with the characters interacting and sometimes battling villains of Anez&#x27;s own creation. Time travel and inter-dimensional travel are common occurrences, with many of the characters hailing from dimensions (or times) other than that of the main continuity. This leads to a number of temporal paradoxes.

Story lines frequently involve breaking the fourth wall, with the strips&#x27; author being a regular character. A running theme of the comic is that most, if not all, of the characters are fully aware that they are in a webcomic.

<text>Jack Little (born John Leonard; May 30, 1899 – April 9, 1956), (Another source gives his birth date as May 28, 1902.) sometimes credited Little Jack Little, was a British-born American composer, singer, pianist, actor, and songwriter whose songs were featured in several movies. He is not to be confused with the burlesque comedian also known as &quot;Little&quot; Jack Little, who stood tall.

==Early years==
Little was born in the Silvertown section of London, but moved to the United States
when he was 9 years old, growing up in Waterloo, Iowa. He was educated in pre-med classes at the University of Iowa, where he played in and organized the university band.

==Career==
Early in his career, Little worked at radio stations, including WSAI and WLW, both in Cincinnati, Ohio. He had a 15-minute daily program (originating from WLW) on NBC radio in the early 1930s.

Little toured the country with an orchestra, appearing in hotels, night clubs, and on radio. In one such touring appearance on radio, at WOC in Davenport, Iowa, Little &quot;made a new endurance record for himself ... when he remained on the air three hours and sixteen minutes ... [and] sang fifty-one songs in answer to thousands of requests.&quot; He collaborated musically with Tommie Malie, Dick Finch, John Siras, and Joe Young.

In 1928 he joined ASCAP. From 1933 to 1937, he recorded prolifically, starting on Bluebird, Columbia, and finally ARC, playing in a light society dance band style. He often worked with musical director Mitchell Ayres. His compositions include &quot;Jealous, I Promise You&quot;, &quot;A Shanty in Old Shanty Town&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re a Heavenly Thing&quot;. Details of his chart success per Joel Whitburn are given below.

==Chart successes==
==Recognition==
Little has a star at 6618 Hollywood Boulevard in the Radio section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.

==Personal life==
He was married to Thea Hellman, who died in 1940; they had two children.

==Death==
Little died in his sleep on April 9, 1956, at his home in Hollywood, Florida after suffering from hepatitis for some time.

<text>Richard Forno is a consultant, lecturer, and writer in the area of Washington, DC.

==Education==
Forno earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in international relations from American University in 1994, a master&#x27;s degree in international relations from Salve Regina University in 2002, and a PhD degree in Internet studies from Curtin University of Technology in 2010. He is also a graduate of Valley Forge Military Academy and College and the United States Naval War College.

==Work==
Dr. Forno is Graduate Program Director for University of Maryland&#x27;s Cybersecurity Program, co-founder of the Maryland Cyber Challenge &amp; Conference, and a visiting scientist at the Software Engineering Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. At one time, Forno was the Chief Information Security Officer for Network Solutions.

Forno writes and publishes on his web site articles on technology, computer security, and politics, roughly at the rate of one every two weeks. An example of his articles is &quot;The Joke of Federal Cybersecurity Oversight&quot;.

==&quot;The Joke of Federal Cybersecurity Oversight&quot;== 
Dated March 2004. Toward the beginning of the essay, Forno lists a series of news articles, mostly from CNET News.com, that describe inadequacies in the Federal Government&#x27;s computer security. (He also notes his opinion that the mass media, in its drive to attract attention, tends to ignore news of &quot;positive&quot; developments in Federal computer security.)

In the rest of the essay, Forno criticizes the Government for insecure administration of information technology.
&quot;Granted, popular enterprise technology is nowhere as secure as it should be, but today&#x27;s federal cybersecurity woes result more from flawed technology management practices than flawed technology. To that end, we need to foster and reward innovative, effective management processes in the federal computer security arena and terminate the current technology management and oversight philosophy that tolerates and rewards idleness and mediocrity while doing little to actually eliminate them.&quot;

<text>The New Guard was an Australian fascist paramilitary organisation during the Great Depression. It was the largest and most successful fascist organisation in Australian history.

The New Guard, known for its violent agitation against NSW Premier Jack Lang, was founded and led by Eric Campbell. At its peak, membership was estimated to be around 50,000. The group&#x27;s membership was predominantly made up of Anglo-Protestant, monarchist and anti-communist elements. 
The organisation attracted great publicity when member Captain Francis de Groot, on horseback and at Campbell&#x27;s direction, upstaged Lang in cutting the ribbon at the opening ceremony of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in protest at the latter&#x27;s anti-monarchist ideology.

After Lang&#x27;s dismissal in 1932, the New Guard&#x27;s membership declined rapidly. Campbell met with fascists and National Socialists such as Sir Oswald Mosley and Joachim von Ribbentrop and, in 1934, published his manifesto &quot;The New Road&quot;, signalling an ideological transition towards Italian corporate statism. As the Centre Party, it unsuccessfully contested five seats at the 1935 New South Wales state election. The party failed to win a single seat, polling 0.60 per cent of the vote. Following the election, Campbell withdrew from public life. Both the party and the New Guard disbanded shortly afterwards.

==History==
===Old Guard===
In response to the election of Jack Lang as Premier of New South Wales, and rising pressure from trade unionists, counter-movements began to rise in opposition to the Labor Party. Among them was the Old Guard, a secret organisation purported to exist as early as 1917, which at the time of the Great Depression was administrated primarily by businessmen Roger Goldfinch and Robert Gillespie, among other anonymous committee members. The Old Guard was a coalition of imperial loyalists, devoted to the British Empire and ready to act preemptively to prevent a socialist revolution from taking place. At the height of its popularity the organisation enjoyed close ties with the NSW Police Force, Attorney-General&#x27;s Department and the Department of Defence, and boasted 30,000 members comprising strongly of rural New South Welshmen and wealthy Protestant Anglo-Saxons.

===Old-New Guard schism===
Among the Old Guard&#x27;s members was World War I veteran Eric Campbell, an army officer and former gunner with the First Australian Imperial Force. Campbell had been introduced to the Old Guard by John Scott, a fellow member of the board of Sydney insurance company Sun Insurance.

Over time, Campbell grew discontented with the Old Guard. The organisation was sworn to absolute secrecy of membership, and was divided into cells as to conceal the identity of its leadership. Campbell disagreed with this arrangement, asserting that the uncommunicative nature of its leadership to its members, mostly returned servicemen, was ill-fitting to their nature as soldiers. He believed that without clear authority and direction, the Old Guard would be unable to retain members. Unable to convince the committee to change its administrative strategy, he and John Scott left the Old Guard. A week after Campbell&#x27;s resignation, he and others from the Old Guard agreed, in mid-February, to form a separate body which would be diametrically opposed to the Old Guard&#x27;s secrecy and what they considered its inaction.

The New Guard was officially formed on 16 March 1931, built on a common ideological system of monarchism, classic liberalism and anti-communism. Campbell was voted Chief Commander. Within a few weeks its membership had swelled.

===Anti-leftist action (1931-32)===

The New Guard was a paramilitary group, its military capability was extremely limited and vastly overstated by its leadership. It was amateurish, ineffectual and likened to the Keystone Cops. During the initial growth of the movement, Campbell was able to attract many ex-soldiers and ex-commanders to the movement, with ex-military making up the majority of the group&#x27;s membership, including the likes of early aviator Charles Kingsford Smith and North Sydney Mayor Hubert Primrose. As general commanding officer, Campbell organised it on military lines. He claimed that, in an &#x27;emergency&#x27;, it could maintain essential services including Bunnerong power house and the police attested to the Guard&#x27;s efficiency. With a peak membership of over 50,000, the Guard rallied in public, broke up &#x27;Communist&#x27; meetings, drilled, vilified the Labor Party and demanded the deportation of Communists. Campbell and his New Guard proceeded to secure connections and weapons so that, in the event of a statewide communist revolt in which the police had become ineffective, he could seize control of essential services and keep them operational. An attempt to clothe its members in uniforms failed, however, when the Guard could not go through with its order for lack of funds. Campbell&#x27;s naïve offer to step in to break a seamen&#x27;s strike in October 1931 was rebuffed by shipowners.

====Violent clashes====
Assisted by motorcar, the New Guard developed a strategy of regularly disrupting left-wing workers&#x27; meetings, spending much of the 1932 summer doing so. During December 1931, Captain Francis de Groot organised around 1,000 New Guardsmen to attack leftist meetings. On 11 December 1931, three policemen were injured in a fight between New Guardsmen and communists in Darlinghurst. On 13 February 1932, 700 New Guardsmen practised military drills in Belmore and a number of journalists who attempted to document the drills were assaulted. A few days later, 13 members of the New Guard were arrested after violently disrupting a political meeting in Coffs Harbour. Violent attacks on leftist meetings continued for weeks as part of a &#x27;general mobilisation&#x27;.

De Groot had stated that he &#x27;felt that, the best reply to force, was greater force&#x27; and by May 1932 Campbell had started inciting street brawls, and came close to staging a coup d&#x27;état against the Lang government. Against this backdrop, the state Labor party formed a number of militias including the Workers&#x27; Defence Army (WDA), the Labor Defence Corps (LDC) and the Australian Labor Army (ALA), formed by Lang&#x27;s supporters. Street fights between Lang&#x27;s Labor Army and fascist paramilitary groups, including Sir Thomas Blamey&#x27;s Victorian-based &quot;White Army, also known as the League of National Security, and the New Guard became increasingly common as the New Guard attempted to discredit the left by starting brawls or other breaches of the peace.

Though the New Guard sought to work as a supplement to the police in the event of a socialist revolution, they were significantly opposed under orders from the Lang government. Of particular use to Lang in opposing the New Guard was William John MacKay, who was appointed Acting Metropolitan Superintendent following the &#x27;Battle of Bankstown&#x27; on 26 February 1932. Following MacKay&#x27;s commencement of a campaign of surveillance and legal persecution, the New Guard attempted to measure the strength of the Sydney police force by organising many small unapproved street meetings across the city in an attempt to stretch their men thin. When forced to disperse by police, each group of New Guardsmen would peacefully disperse and simply reform nearby. According to a contact Campbell had in the NSW Police Force, the police were reporting large street gatherings and were requesting reinforcements from all over the city.

====Opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge====
On 19 March 1932, the New Guard interrupted the much-anticipated opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The New Guard had wanted to have Sir Philip Game open the bridge on behalf of King George V, but Lang refused, stating that &quot;I will open it myself, it&#x27;ll be cheaper&quot;. The New Guard declared that Lang would not perform the ceremony, with Campbell calling Lang a &#x27;tyrant and scoundrel&#x27; and declaring that Lang would never open the Harbour Bridge. Rumours began to circulate of a plot to kidnap Lang.

During the opening ceremony, army officer and zone commander Francis de Groot upstaged Jack Lang by slashing the ceremonial ribbon with his sword. De Groot was supplied with a horse by fellow New Guardsmen Albert Reichard and he rode to the ceremony in his World War I 15th Hussars uniform, managing to slash the ribbon before Lang. De Groot was pulled from his horse and detained, later being fined £9 (equivalent to $859.99 in 2017). The Mayor of North Sydney, Hubert Primrose, an official participant at the opening ceremony, was also a member of the New Guard.

====Assault on Jock Garden====
On 6 May 1932, Trades and Labour Council secretary John (Jock) Garden, an influential member of Lang&#x27;s inner circle, was assaulted by members a New Guard faction known as the Fascist Legion. Garden was assaulted at his home by eight hooded men in Ku Klux Klan-like gowns. The incident caused massive resignations from the New Guard.

===Decline===
====1932 constitutional crisis====

On 13 May 1932, Lang was dismissed from his premiership. Along with an inner faction of the New Guard&#x27;s involvement in orchestrating the bashing of Communist Party of Australia founder Jock Garden, the New Guard began to lose popularity as the organisation&#x27;s purpose was perceived as having been fulfilled. The activities of militant splinter groups emerging from the New Guard, such as the Fascist Legion, also contributed to a rush of resignations which began even before Lang&#x27;s dismissal.

By mid-1932, the New Guard was largely a spent force. With their main objective complete – the removal of Lang from office – the New Guard continued to lose members as it drifted into the mid-1930s. Even de Groot left the organisation in November 1932, pursuing collaboration with the Melbourne-based League of National Security by which the White Army was also known. It was during this time that Campbell began to outline more fully his political beliefs, producing a series of broadcasts in which he developed a &quot;complete credo for a fascist State&quot;, most notably incorporating a &quot;non-elective cabinet or commission, a corporative assembly, vocational franchise and a charter of liberty&quot;. He also stated his intentions to contest the next state election, a date for which had not yet been set.

====1933: Exploration into fascism====
Campbell&#x27;s memoirs state that due to the New Guard&#x27;s opposition to party politics and unwillingness to align themselves with either side, they were often dubbed &quot;fascists&quot;. Though the New Guard bore resemblance to the militant Blackshirts in Italy, its strong adherence to individualism found it disqualified it from this definition. Campbell was curious to learn about fascism from the source however, so in 1933 during an overseas business trip, he met with Sir Oswald Mosley and wife Lady Cynthia at their London home to discuss the matter. His experience was overall positive, and while unimpressed with the members of Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists, he was reminded of his own New Guardmen when he attended an Imperial Fascist League meeting.

With Mosley&#x27;s recommendations he later progressed to Berlin where, unable to meet Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler, he was able to see Foreign Affairs Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, as well as Alfred Rosenberg. In Rome he was likewise unable to see Mussolini, instead meeting with Secretary Achille Starace, though their mutual unintelligibility and failure to use French as a medium was no use. Nevertheless, Campbell&#x27;s tour across the fascist powers of Europe left him deeply impressed with the ideology. However, on his return to Australia, Campbell&#x27;s support for an &quot;openly pro-fascist policy&quot; was met with strong opposition from the Guard&#x27;s &quot;anti-fascist moderates&quot;. These attempts to establish the movement as what historian Keith Amos dubs &quot;Australia&#x27;s first fascist party&quot; are thought to hastened the decline of the New Guard, with many previous members unhappy with the ideological progression that had taken place. One year later he would pen his manifesto &quot;The New Road&quot; which put forward his case for an Australian application of Italian corporate statism.

====1935 state election====

One idea expressed in Campbell&#x27;s manifesto was that the emergence of a &quot;centre party&quot; in Australia was inevitable. While initially satisfied by the prospects of a United Australia Party-led purging of communism and other socialistic and anti-communist dogmas from the continent, Campbell had realised that the central tenets of the New Guard could not be fulfilled due to those politicians&#x27; ineffectiveness in bringing them about. Becoming fully dissatisfied with the politics that had, in his words, &quot;degenerated into a number of sordid business undertakings&quot;, the New Guard entered into party politics.

The Centre Party was officially established in December 1933 at a meeting of over 1,000 people, with &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reporting that 100 branches of the party would be established. The majority of the shrinking organisation endorsed its move into electoral politics, which was, according to Campbell, &quot;necessitated by the failure of the UAP governments, at both federal and state levels, to accede to the New Guard&#x27;s demands&quot;. Due to a lack of time needed to organise the campaign, the party did not contest the September 1934 federal election. An August 1934 meeting of the New Guard reaffirmed Campbell as leader, and resolved to &quot;make itself felt in the next State elections&quot;.

At the May 1935 New South Wales state election, the Centre Party contested five out of the 90 Legislative Assembly districts, all in suburban Sydney, and polled 0.60 percent of the total vote. In two seats, Hornsby, contested by Fergus Munro, and Lane Cove, contested by Campbell, only the Centre Party and the United Australia Party fielded candidates, with the former polling over 15 percent of the vote in both seats. In the other seats it contested, the Centre Party candidates failed to poll more than 5 percent of the vote. The party&#x27;s relatively high vote in Hornsby and Lane Cove is thought to have represented &quot;merely the level of protest against [UAP Premier] Stevens&quot; in the absence of other candidates.

In Arncliffe, the only seat that required a preference distribution, the majority (56.78%) of Centre Party preferences flowed to the United Australia candidate, Horace Harper, who was defeated by Labor&#x27;s Joseph Cahill, a future premier. Enoch Jones, the candidate for Arncliffe, later served as a City of Rockdale councillor, and contested the seat of Rockdale for the Liberal Democrats at the 1944 state election. Additionally, Aubrey Murphy, the candidate in Concord, served on two occasions as mayor of the Blue Mountains City Council in the 1950s, and was named an MBE in the 1960 New Year Honours.

With the exception of occasional speaking engagements, Campbell largely withdrew from public life following the election, and spent most of the rest of his life in country New South Wales, where he was president of the Burrangong Shire Council in 1949 and 1950 (now part of Young Shire). Campbell&#x27;s 1965 autobiographical account of his involvement in the New Guard, &quot;The Rallying Point&quot;, considered &quot;confused&quot;, &quot;highly unreliable&quot; and a work of &quot;historical fiction&quot; by Moore in any event, does not mention the Centre Party at all. Later writers have suggested that the party&#x27;s lack of success at the 1935 election represented &quot;an electoral brick-wall&quot;, with the party overall a &quot;failure&quot; and Campbell&#x27;s movement having &quot;lost most of its drive&quot;.

==Organisation==

At its inception, the administrative structure of the New Guard consisted of an Organising Committee led by a chairman with powers to add more committee members by way of a unanimous vote. This committee would be tasked with the recruitment of members and their separation by localities across the Sydney and regional New South Wales areas. Following the meeting at Cahill&#x27;s, the structure of the organisation was revised in an attempt to exercise &quot;practical democracy&quot;. The power allotted to each position in the New Guard changed as the organisation was built.

The area of Greater Sydney would be broken down into four independent Zones: A Zone, consisting of the land north of Sydney Harbour; B Zone, covering the Eastern Suburbs as well as from the coastline down to Maroubra; C Zone, incorporating the Southern Suburbs down to and including the Sutherland Shire; and D Zone, including the Western Suburbs to the west of Parramatta. These Zones would be divided into Divisions and then subdivided into Localities. As part of Campbell&#x27;s practical democratic solution, each Locality would operate as independent units where a few hundred New Guardsmen would select for themselves a Locality Commanders and Administrator to handle affairs, and each Locality would frequently meet at Locality Conventions to discuss and vote on matters. The Locality Commanders of each Division would select Divisional Commanders, and said Divisional Commanders would meet to pick the Zone Commander for their respective Zone. Divisional and Zone Commanders would only assume active command positions when more than one of their respective subdivisions were active in a particular objective, therefore making Localities especially independent in the operation of the New Guard.

The executive branch of the New Guard was the General Council, consisting of the leading Chief Commander and four Zone Commanders with equal voting power. The General Council was only to make decisions regarding major executive matters, and questions regarding routine and defensive emergencies would be directed to the Chief Commander, or Deputy Chief Commander if the former was absent. During the period of structural preparation the Chief Commander was to not interfere in the movement&#x27;s formation, and only assume complete executive involvement once the Locality system was completely established. To put checks on the General Council&#x27;s power, Campbell formed the Council of Action, consisting of the Chief Commander and Divisional Commanders; the Chief Commander would be deprived of a vote.

Intelligence on the New Guard&#x27;s political rivals would be collected by the individual Localities and submitted to the Chief of the Intelligence Branch for collation. While being essential to the New Guard&#x27;s functionality, it was sometimes inaccurate in its intelligence gathering; flawed analysis of the political demographics of Sydney claimed that there were 252,473 Communists in ten Sydney electorates alone.

As Campbell allowed considerable independence for the Localities and permitted members to associate freely with any political party so long that the New Guard&#x27;s central values were upheld, splinter groups such as the Fascist Legion (also known as the Pack of Cards) formed. Legion members wore Ku Klux Klan-style gowns and hoods at their own internal meetings in order to guarantee anonymity, adopting pseudonyms based on particular playing cards in a standard 52-card deck (excluding queens). Keeping with the theme of playing cards, the Fascist Legion&#x27;s leader was led by &quot;the Joker&quot;. Its membership was estimated at 49. Besides investigating disloyalty and laxity within the New Guard, they purportedly engaged in targeted operations such as the aforementioned attack on Jock Garden. They were reported to be planning kidnappings and police arm store raids. The activity of splinter groups such as the Fascist Legion contributed to the bleeding of members in the lead-up to Lang&#x27;s dismissal by Sir Philip Game.

==Membership==
Standards for New Guard membership had prospective members picked irrespective of class, financial situation or party affiliations, so long as they were of good character. For maximal utility, the membership system was split into three groups:

*A class - Members who were physically able, and could be employed for operations both within Localities and outside its boundaries if needed
*B class - Members with technical qualifications, regardless of age, who could assist in the maintenance of essential services such as water, electricity and transport services, among others, in the event of a socialist revolution
*C class - Members that due to their age or personality could only be trusted to handle operations within their own Locality

New Guardsmen of their own Locality were encouraged to participate during Locality Conventions to decide matters specific to their area. A member was not kept within the organisation against their will, as they could leave at any time for any reason. This was to ensure that the New Guard could preserve its democratic, voluntary elements established at its founding.

Estimates of the New Guard&#x27;s membership count are contradictory. A report conducted by the NSW Police in September 1931 found 87,000 had sought membership and by December of the same year there were 39,000 card-carrying members – with 3,000 residing in the country centres of regional NSW. For practical reasons, Campbell&#x27;s internal estimations of membership count focused on those that the New Guard could rely on in the event of a socialist revolution. In that he estimated the figure at 20,000. For propaganda reasons, the New Guard&#x27;s membership was often publicly exaggerated, as when Campbell foreshadowed a procession of 100,000 men along Macquarie Street to present a petition to Sir Game.

<doc id="563673" wikidata="Q7011763" url="?curid=563673" title="New South Wales Police Force">
<text>The New South Wales Police Force is a law enforcement agency of the state of New South Wales, Australia, established in 1862. With more than 17,000 police officers, it is the largest police organisation in Australia, policing an area of 801,600 square kilometres with a population of more than 8.2 million people.

In 2020, it had 21,455 employees – 17,348 police officers and 4,107 support staff, 432 police stations, 3,300 vehicles, 52 boats, 9 aircraft and a budget of AUD $4.8 billion. It is organised into police area commands (PACs) in metropolitan areas, police districts (PDs) in rural areas and specialist commands.

It performs law enforcement in all areas of the state. Local government authorities and other agencies have very limited law enforcement responsibilities. The capacity of magistrates and justices to appoint constables was removed and the Commissioner of the NSW Police now has sole control of the appointment of constables in the state.

==Mission statement and aims==
The &quot;Police Act 1990&quot; states the mission of the NSW Police is &quot;to work with the community to reduce violence, crime and fear&quot;.

NSW Police aim to protect the community by
* Preventing, detecting and investigating crime
* Monitoring and promoting road safety
* Maintaining social order
* Performing and coordinating search and rescue operations

==Insignia, motto and symbols==
Until 1972, NSW Police wore very plain insignia containing just the words &quot;Police&quot; and &quot;New South Wales&quot; or &quot;N.S.W.&quot;, a crown and sometimes a state badge. After 1972, NSW Police wore hexagonal shoulder patches with the text &quot;N.S.W. Police.&quot; After 1972, NSW Police adopted a far more elaborate and colourful insignia featuring a diminutive state badge above a soaring wedge-tailed eagle carrying a scroll with the word &quot;&quot;, the Greek goddess of chastisement and vengeance, which is meant to signify retribution and justice, within a ring containing the name at the time - initially &quot;New South Wales Police Department&quot; and currently &quot;New South Wales Police Force&quot;, surrounded by a wreath. All above a ribbon containing the motto Culpram Poena Premit Comes, and all surmounted by the crown of the NSW head of state. This insignia was first used, informally, in 1959 at a South Pacific Police Commissioners&#x27; Conference in the table place names of each of the attending commissioners and was designed for this purpose by then Detective Sergeant Norm Merchant but was not adopted for use on uniforms or widely until 1972. Its current badges, including those worn on uniform shoulders, contain the insignia elaborated even further in a shield shape edged in yellow with “N.S.W. Police” repeated in yellow, at the top.

Its current motto is in Latin, &quot;Culpam Poena Premit Comes&quot; (&quot;Punishment follows closely upon the heels of crime&quot;).

The NSW Police Force has updated its insignia replacing the St Edwards Crown with the Tudor Crown. The NSW Police Force Facebook page published an image of the new insignia on 11 August 2024. The NSW Police Force website has been updated with the new insignia. 

===Banner, flag and pennants===
On 29 September 2006, the Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, presented a banner to NSW Police at a ceremony held adjacent to the NSW Police roll of honour at The Domain.

NSW Police sometimes use a flag, with the &quot;Nemesis&quot; emblem on a bicolour of light blue over white. In ceremonies, Mounted Police occasionally carry swallow-tailed blue and white pennants on lances. The Commissioner and VIP cyclists sometimes use swallow-tailed blue and white pennants with a Nemesis logo on their transportation.

==History==
The NSW Police were established in 1862 under the &quot;Police Regulation Act 1862&quot; which unified all existing police units in the colony under an Inspector General of Police.

===1788 – Early forms of law enforcement===
Law enforcement has existed in various forms since the foundation of the colony of New South Wales at Sydney in 1788. In order to protect the infant town against thieves and petty criminals after dark, Governor Arthur Phillip authorised the formation of a nightwatch in August 1789, consisting of eight of the best-behaved convicts. After his appointment as the new governor of New South Wales, Governor Lachlan Macquarie restructured the various police in January 1811, setting up a basic system of ranks and control and recruiting free men instead of convicts. Police units were under the rule of the District Magistrates.

===1825 – NSW Mounted Police===
After conflict in 1824 with the Wiradjuri people around Bathurst and Mudgee, the colonial authorities in New South Wales recognised the need for a mounted force to maintain control on the frontier. As a result, the NSW Mounted Police was formed in the following year. Up until 1850, this force operated as &quot;de facto&quot; cavalry unit as the troopers were soldiers requisitioned from the colonial forces of Australia. Their main task in this period was to subdue groups of Aboriginals resisting European colonisation and capture bushrangers. From 1850 the Mounted Police took on a more civilian role. In 2009, it had 34 horses and was claimed to be the oldest mounted police unit in the world. Another specialist group formed commenced operation during this time. The Water Police were formed in 1832.

===1839 – Border Police===
By this stage, the NSW government could not afford the cost of maintaining the Mounted Police along the expanding frontiers of the colony. A new frontier police consisting of mounted convict troopers, called the Border Police, was therefore established. The convicts assigned were mostly soldiers who had run afoul of the law. The Border Police was funded by a levy placed on the squatters who had brought livestock into the areas beyond the borders of settlement. In addition to controlling the Aboriginal and bushranger threats, the Border Police were also tasked with resolving land disputes with the squatters.

===1848 – Native Police===
With the end of convict transportation approaching, the Border Police was dissolved and replaced with another low-cost frontier force called the Native Police. This force consisted of Aboriginal troopers under the command of European officers. The role of this force was mostly to maintain peace between Aboriginals and settlers. Some writers suggest it suppressed Aboriginal resistance and exploited intertribal hostility. From 1859, the responsibility of the Native Police passed from the NSW government to the newly formed Queensland government.

In the early 1850s, Victoria was separated from New South Wales and created its own force.

===1862 – Establishment of the Police Force===
As the colony expanded, a more sophisticated form of crime management was called for. This involved unifying all the police units into a single cohesive police organisation with the centralisation of authority. After a failed attempt made by Act No. 38 of 1850, unified control of the police eventuated in 1862 when the Police Regulation Act (1862) was passed, establishing the NSW Police. The first Inspector General of Police, John McLerie, was appointed to assume overall authority and responsibility. The Police Regulation (Amendment) Act, passed in 1935, changed the title to Commissioner of Police, with its role clearly defined. The position of Deputy Commissioner was also created.

By 1872, there were 70 police stations throughout the colony in sub-districts, with a total of 803 police officers.

In July 1915, the first female police officers commenced duty, being Misses Lilian May Armfield (1884–1971) and Maude Marion Rhodes (–1956).

In 1961, the number of NSW Police had increased to 5,717 and by November 2008, it had increased to 15,354.

===Bushrangers===
After the formation of the NSW Police in 1862, the most serious crimes were committed by bushrangers, particularly during the Victorian gold rush years. Constable Byrne almost single-handedly fought off the Ben Hall gang when they attacked a gold escort at Majors Creek on 13 March 1865. Constable O&#x27;Grady was taken ill with cholera when, on 9 April 1866, he left his sick-bed to confront the Clarke gang, which was incorrectly renowned as being the &quot;bloodiest bushrangers&quot; of the colony of NSW and of Australia. Constable Walker was one of the earliest Australian-born mounted troopers to gain fame. He brought Captain Thunderbolt&#x27;s enduring &quot;bushranging&quot; career to an end by shooting him near Uralla in New England, NSW.

Constable Ernest Charles Day (later the Inspector General of Police) showed courage under fire when he shot and captured bushranger Hobson, who was later executed by hanging. Day later investigated a string of murders involving a hawker, Tommy Moore, by tracing his activities to South Australia, solving one of Australia&#x27;s earliest serial-killer cases.

===1894 – Arming===
In 1894, a number of unarmed police were seriously injured while attempting to arrest a group of offenders as they attempted to break open a safe in the Union Steamship Company Office in Bridge Street, Sydney. The incident received wide publicity and was known as &quot;Bridge Street Affray&quot;.

Within 24 hours, the Premier announced that all Police would wear firearms at all times while on duty to prevent the escape of felons and to place them on an equal footing with armed criminals. Previously, only police in rural districts had been permitted to carry firearms.

Parliament subsequently passed legislation authorising the arming of all NSW Police and they have carried firearms since.

===1979 – Lusher Commission of Inquiry===

In 1979, the NSW government of Neville Wran called on Justice Edwin Lusher, a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to chair a commission of inquiry into police administration.

===1990s renamings===
The &quot;Police Service Act 1990&quot; replaced the &quot;Police Regulation Act&quot;. The NSW Police Force was renamed the NSW Police Service, which reflected &quot;community-based policing at the time&quot; of the Greiner government and the public&#x27;s responsibility in crime control, aided by the police. In accordance with the &quot;Police Service Amendment (NSW Police) Bill&quot; in 2002, the New South Wales Police Service was then renamed again, to simply New South Wales Police. The then Minister for Police, Michael Costa, explains: In 2006, the &quot;Police Amendment (Miscellaneous) Bill&quot; resulted in a name change for the third time, renaming the New South Wales Police to New South Wales Police Force.

===1991 – Amalgamation of special security units===
In June 1991, the State Protection Group (SPG) was formed, incorporating the former Special Weapons and Operations Section (SWOS), the Witness Security Unit, regional Tactical Response Groups and the Rescue Squad. The Security Management Branch and the Bomb Disposal Unit were later included in the group.

===1992 – Volunteering and NSW Police===
After much debate, the NSW Parliament passed the &quot;Police Service (Volunteer Police) Amendment Act 1992&quot;, which sought to trial voluntary service within the police force, along the lines of the United Kingdom&#x27;s special constabularies. The trial lapsed with the automatic repeal of the Act in 1994. The successor to this scheme was the Volunteers in Policing (VIP) program which restricts volunteer participation to non-core administration and community tasks, without enforcement duties or other powers being granted.

===1995 – Wood Royal Commission===

The 1990s was a turbulent period in NSW Police history. A Commission of inquiry into the NSW Police was held between 1995 and 1997. The commission uncovered hundreds of instances of bribery, money laundering, drug trafficking, and falsifying of evidence by police. Then Police Commissioner Tony Lauer resigned as the level of corruption within the service became clear, and his own position became untenable. Peter James Ryan was recruited from the United Kingdom. Wide-ranging reforms occurred as a result of the recommendations of the Royal Commission, including the establishment of a permanent Police Integrity Commission. The royal commissioner was Justice James Roland Wood. The terms of reference were to look into systemic and entrenched corruption within the NSW Police, towards the end of the Royal Commission it also investigated alleged paedophile activities within the Police Service. Of particular note was the Detectives&#x27; Division of the Kings Cross patrol, of which almost all the senior ranks, including the chief detective, were involved in serious and organised corrupt activities, including taking regular bribes from major drug traffickers.

=== 2003 – Police bugging ===

In 2003, Strike Force Emblems was established in response to allegations that warrants were improperly obtained during Operation Mascot, an investigation into police corruption in the late 1990s. The warrants authorised a large number of people, mostly police officers, to have their private conversations &#x27;bugged&#x27;. Nearly a decade later in October 2012, the New South Wales Government announced that the Ombudsman would investigate allegations concerning the conduct of officers in the NSW Police Force, the Crime Commission and the Police Integrity Commission in relation to the matters investigated in Strike Force Emblems which occurred between 1998 and 2002. The final hearings were not completed until 31 March 2015.

The Acting NSW Ombudsman, John McMillan&#x27;s report to Parliament was tabled on 20 December 2016.

===2015 – Police headquarters shooting===

On 2 October 2015, 15-year-old Iraqi-Kurdish boy Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar shot dead Curtis Cheng, a 58-year-old accountant who worked for the NSW Police Force, outside their Parramatta headquarters. The 15-year-old then shot at responding special constables, and died from their return gunfire. NSW Police commissioner Andrew Scipione said &quot;We believe that his actions were politically motivated and therefore linked to terrorism&quot;. The attack appears to have similar motives to the 2014 Endeavour Hills stabbings.

==Organisation==

=== Leadership structure ===
The NSW Police headquarters is at 1 Charles Street, Parramatta, Sydney.

The current commissioner of the NSW Police is Karen Webb, . The Minister for Police, is responsible to the Parliament of New South Wales for the police portfolio.

NSW Police is split into four divisions, each overseen by a Deputy Commissioner.

===Police Area Commands and Police Districts===
The state&#x27;s 432 police stations are organised into six Regions, which are then divided into Police Area Commands (PACs, consisting of metropolitan areas) and Police Districts (PDs, consisting of rural areas). Each region contains 7–12 PACs/PDs, which are listed by name and CAD prefix/vehicle ID. 
Note: Some specialist units use region codes as their callsign, for example Highway Patrol and Regional Enforcement Squads, which utilise callsigns such as NWM212 and SWM511.

==Specialist units==

=== Police Transport &amp; Public Safety Command ===
The Police Transport Command (PTC) is a high visibility proactive policing unit responsibility for dealing with crime and anti-social behaviour on the public transport network. PTC officers deploy across public transport based on criminal intelligence and targeting known hot spots, in addition to conducting operations during high traffic events. Modes of transport covered by PTC include trains, buses, ferries, taxis and light rail. PTC works closely on operations with other specialist commands, such as the Dog Unit, which assist in drug detection on public transport. PTC takes part in Project Servator, a policing project designed to disrupt criminal activity, including terrorism, while providing a reassuring Police presence for the public. Project Servator officers are specially trained to spot tell-tale signs that someone is planning or preparing to commit a crime, and work to empower the public to remain vigilant and report when they see something unusual or suspicious.
=== The Marine Area Command (MAC) ===
The MAC is responsible for policing the waterways and coast of NSW. The MAC operates a fleet of over 50 vessels along the NSW coast, tasked with crime prevention and detection on waterways, overseeing aquatic events and controlling spectator craft, co-ordinating and conducting maritime search and rescue operations and enforcing safety and compliance among those on the water. The MAC is responsible for the waters up to 200 nautical miles off the NSW coast and operates 11 sea going vessels, including the OPV Nemesis the largest purpose built Police boat in the Southern Hemisphere. The MAC frequently conducts high visibility policing operations, utilising its road vehicles to transport police boats and jet skis to target locations, including inland waterways such as lakes and rivers. Police vessels and personnel are strategically located at important commercial and leisure ports with the base at Balmain on Sydney Harbour. You can find the water police at Broken Bay, Newcastle,Coffs Harbour, Botany Bay, Port Stephens, Eden and Port Kembla. Some remote country waterways are serviced by their Local Area Commands. They also have a Marine Operations Support Team (MOST) which conducts specialist marine operations such as marine security and ship boarding at major events. Police Divers conduct SCUBA operations, primarily conducting search and recovery operations for important evidence and missing persons.

=== The Aviation Command ===
Commonly referred to as PolAir, operates a fleet of nine aircraft that support policing from the air. Operations conducted by Pol Air include aerial patrols, tracking of offenders (including vehicle and foot pursuits), searching for missing persons (including suspects, the elderly, children and bushwalkers), searching for missing vessels and aircraft, conducting rescue missions (including water rescues with their trained rescue swimmers), providing air cover for major events and incidents, aerial surveillance, aerial speed enforcement, reconnaissance, counter-terrorism operations and transporting specialist Police elements and equipment. Aircraft are equipped with advanced integrated technology systems including high-definition cameras, forward looking infra red (FLIR) cameras, 30 million candle power search lights, live video downlink capability and advanced navigation programs. The fleet consists of six helicopters (3x Bell 429, 2x Bell 412EPI and 1x Eurocopter EC135) and three fixed-wing aircraft (2x Cessna 208 and 1x Cessna 206).
=== The Mounted Unit ===
Commonly referred to as the “Mounted Police”, they conduct policing operations on horseback. The unit operates 34 horses, providing crowd management at major events, supporting Police during civil unrest and public order incidents, conducting search missions over tough terrain and general police patrols. The unit also conducts ceremonial duties.

=== The Dog Unit ===
Commonly referred to as the Dog Squad, provides specialist canines to support policing duties. General Purpose Dogs are used to support typical front line policing operations, with common tasks including tracking offenders, searching for evidence, searching for missing persons, supporting police officers in dangerous situations and conducting high visibility foot patrols in busy areas and at major events. The unit also utilises several different types of dogs for a number of specialist roles including:
* Tactical Dogs
* Blood Hounds
* Cadaver Dogs
* Drug Detection Dogs
* Explosive and Firearm Detection Dogs
* Urban Search and Rescue Dogs

School Liaison Police (SLP) works with high schools to reduce youth crime, violence and anti-social behaviour through a range of school intervention strategies, educational programs and local relationships that model respect and responsibility. Officers develop and present programs in conjunction with teaching staff and act as a central point of contact on Police, community and school issues. SLP officers may provide information, support and guidance on security, intervention strategies and child protection matters relating to the school as well as other issues relating to safety and community responsibility.

=== Counter Terrorism &amp; Special Tactics Command ===

=== The Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit (RBDU) ===
Provides specialized emergency support to Police activities. Its capabilities include conducting rescue operations, accessing and restraining suicidal persons and illegal demonstrators in precarious situations such as atop buildings, co-ordination of land searches for missing persons, conducting complex body recoveries (such as people down cliffs) and crime scene support, including scene preservation, evidence protection and assisting investigators with logistics such as lighting and tents. The RBDU also provides the Police Force&#x27;s bomb squad capability.
=== The Public Order and Riot Squad (PORS) ===
Provides a surge capacity to support Police operations, as well as a number of specialist support functions. Riot officers operate in squads of three to four, from specially equipped black four wheel drive vehicles. They are deployed across NSW on a regular needs basis. Its primary roles include crowd control, riot control, executing moderate risk search warrants, missing persons searches, evidence searches, disaster victim identification (DVI), chemical, biological and radiological response, searches for explosive devices, high visibility policing at major events such as festivals and sports games, conducting high-impact police operations in known trouble spots for violence such as Kings Cross, and assisting at incidents in correctional facilities. The squad moves freely around the city throughout the day, travelling to hot spot areas as they flare up. The squad is now equipped with M4 assault rifles to conduct counter terrorism patrols. After specialist training they can provide a first response capability to active shooter and terror incidents.

=== State Protection Group ===

The State Protection Group (SPG) is part of the Counter Terrorism &amp; Special Tactics Command of the New South Wales Police Force and was established in 1991 to deal with extraordinary policing responses. The SPG directly supports police in high-risk incidents such as sieges with specialized tactical, negotiation, intelligence and command-support services. The unit also provides rescue and bomb disposal support, canine policing, and armoury services.
=== Tactical Operations Unit (TOU) ===
TOU is the State’s most elite police unit, responsible for the most dangerous and high risk police operations in New South Wales. The unit is equipped with specialist firearms including submachine guns, rifles and shotguns, along with specialist equipment and vehicles such as armored Chevrolet vans and Lenco BearCat armoured vehicles. Their roles include high risk search warrants, the arrests of armed and dangerous criminals, dealing with active armed offenders, containing and resolving siege situations, dealing with complex situations such as barricaded suspects, hostage takings and hijackings and conducting counter-terrorism operations. The unit is sometimes supported by the Tactical Operations Regional Support (TORS) unit, which provides a part-time tactical response capability in the regional areas of the state, made up of regular officers who receive equal high level tactical operations training and equipment. There are a number of specialist roles within the unit including TOU Snipers and Intelligence Officers.

=== Tactical Operations Regional Support (TORS) ===
It provides specialist support to the Tactical Operations Unit in resolving high-risk incidents in regional New South Wales. Comprising part-time tactical operatives from non-metropolitan areas. While primarily a regional resource, TORS can be deployed throughout the State to assist the Tactical Operations Unit. TORS teams are equipped with a range of specialist tactical gear including less than lethal munitions such as Tasers, beanbags as well as various shotguns and M4/M16 Assault rifles. The TOU is responsible for the initial selection and training of TORS applicants, followed up by monthly local training and an annual TOU re-certification camp. TORS officers also attend different training camps organized by Tactical Operations Unit to maintain their training levels. The range of skills TORS operators are required to possess are efficiency in bushcraft and navigation, close quarter tactics, entry methods, ballistic shield operations, cordon and perimeter operations, advanced weapons training, and less than lethal tactics.

Strike Force Puma (SF Puma)targets high-risk drivers who display extreme and erratic behaviours, and those with a history of licence and drink/drug driving offences, who pose the highest risk to the community on the road. In a similar manner to how repeat domestic violence and drug offenders are targeted by dedicated Police units, the Strike Force targets high-risk drivers with a known dangerous history and multiple repeat offences. The team also investigates video footage obtained by Police of dangerous driving from sources such as social media and dash cams.

=== Crash Investigation Unit (CIU) ===
Provides expertise in motor vehicle crash investigations, particularly crashes involving criminal offences. The unit attends and investigates fatal crashes resulting in death or where death is likely and serious crashes where criminal charges are likely. Other types of crashes investigated include those where the responsible party cannot be determined, serious crashes where a driver has fled the scene, serious crashes where an on duty Police officer is involved and other major incidents of unusual nature such as bus crashes.

=== Forensic Evidence &amp; Technical Services Command ===

=== Police Armoury ===
The Police Armoury was established in 1872 and provides specialist engineering services, maintenance and supply of ammunition, firearms and weapons systems for the NSW Police Force.

=== NSW Police Band ===
The NSW Police Band was established in 1895 and is the longest-serving uniformed concert band in Australia. It today incorporates 10 different ensembles used for different activities. It is one of only two full-time police bands in Australia.

=== NSW Police Pipe Band ===
The NSW Police pipe band, founded in 1946, is an auxiliary unit of the Police band. Its first formal engagement was the Newcastle Centenary Celebrations in September 1947. During the early 1990s, the band was shut down as a cost cutting measure. Many ex-members went on to reform the band in an informal capacity during the ANZAC Day march in the early 1990s. It has participated in events such as the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in Sydney. It is also stilled called upon to perform at attestation parades and national police Remembrance Day.

==Uniform and equipment==
=== Field and service dress uniforms ===

NSW Police general duties police wear an operational (field dress) or ceremonial (service dress) uniform.

Field dress consists of navy blue cargo pants with map pockets, bloused at the bottom, light blue marle short- or long-sleeve shirt, navy blue baseball cap with blue and white Sillitoe tartan and black general purpose boots. A utility vest is also worn, carrying various equipment such as body cameras, pepper spray, batons and radio. During winter a navy blue polar fleece jacket or leather jacket is worn. Ranks are worn on the shoulders by both NCOs and commissioned ranks. All officers are also supplied with high-visibility vests and raincoats that can be worn over other uniform.

Service dress consists of straight leg navy blue trousers, blue shirt, peak cap/hat and leather duty jacket and black general purpose boots. Depending on rank, members may be issued with high-shine polishable lace-up leather boots for ceremonial occasions. When attending courts, NSW Police usually wear the full-service dress.

NSW Police College staff, protocol and field protocol officers generally wear a navy blue ceremonial tunic during formal occasions such as attestation parades (passing out parades), medal ceremonies and funerals. Field protocol officers wear a light blue/navy blue lanyard over the right shoulder and tucked into the right pocket during ceremonial occasions. Full-time protocol officers and members of the VIP cyclists are entitled to wear a black basketweave Sam Browne belt during ceremonial occasions.

The current shoulder patch for uniform reads &quot;New South Wales Police Force&quot; and has a redesigned and re-coloured eagle.

===Specialist and special event uniforms===
Specialist units such as the Public Order and Riot Squad, Homicide Squad, Marine Area Command and the State Protection Group Tactical Operations Unit all have different uniform needs and are outfitted accordingly such as Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit with their white overalls, Tactical Operations Unit (TOU) with black and Dog Squad with subdued blue. Detectives wear plain clothes.

For black tie or formal dinners/dances, NSW Police can wear mess dress with mess kit, consisting of dark navy-blue trousers and mess jacket with cobalt blue cuffs, epaulettes (with ranks) and lapels.

During ANZAC Day marches and United Nations Day marches in Sydney, NSW Police who have served with the Australian Federal Police in United Nations peacekeeping operations wear the United Nations blue beret and full-sized medals.

===Name plates and identification===

Each police officer is issued an identification metal badge with a Warrant Card. Behind the Police badge, a member has a coloured plastic backing card that helps identify a member&#x27;s rank in the force, namely:

*light blue – Constable or Senior Constable
*dark blue – Sergeant or Senior Sergeant
*red – Inspector or Chief Inspector
*green – Superintendent or Chief Superintendent
*white – Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner or Commissioner

This colour-coding also occurs on members&#x27; name plates. For administrative officers of all grades and Special Constables, their name plates are gold. Volunteers in Policing wear black nameplates. Civilian staff are not issued with badges except for Special Constables who are issued a metal wallet badge with a gold plastic backing board. Special Constables and civilian forensics staff are also issued with warrant cards. Everyone else such as plainclothes police officers is issued an Identification Certificate (Identification Card).

===Arms and appointments===

====Firearms====
Members of the NSW Police are issued with the full-size 9x19mm Glock 17 semi-automatic pistol, as well as the Glock 19 and 26 compact and subcompact variants respectively for some specialist sections and plain clothes officers. As of 2024, these 9x19mm Glock variants began replacing the previously issued .40-calibre Glock 22, 23, and 27 semi-automatic pistols. The .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 was formerly standard issue, before the work of Task Force ALPHA 1992 and the research testing and report done by senior constable Darren Stewart, who recommended the introduction of the Glock 22 and its variants. Members are also issued with a spare magazine for their pistol due to the murder of two officers, armed with 6 shot revolvers, at Crescent Head in 1995 when officers carried the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 in .38 Special. Specialist tactical units such as the full-time Tactical Operations Unit (and part-time regional State Protection Support Units) are equipped with a variety of specialised firearms for their duties. The Public Order and Riot Squad are issued with a variety of specialist equipment for their roles including Colt M4 Carbine rifles.

====Equipment and holsters====

In addition to the standard issue firearm, officers are issued with Saflock (mark IV &amp; V) handcuffs, OC (oleoresin capsicum spray), ASP expandable baton, Motorola APX6000 (digital encrypted UHF) or Tait Orca (VHF) portable radio, and a first-aid kit. Members have access to a fixed baton and Maglite rechargeable torch, which are usually located in all first response Police vehicles for each officer &quot;on the truck&quot;. There is also access to high ballistic rated overt body armour in every vehicle as required. Specialist tactical officers from elite units such as the State Protection Group and riot officers from the Public Order and Riot Squad have access to a variety of specialised weapons and equipment.

NSW Police has issued TASER electronic control devices (ECDs) which generally are carried by one officer on every first response general duties vehicle. TASER is also issued to some specialist squads (e.g. Public Order and Riot Squad, Tactical Operations Unit and Tactical Operations Regional Support). Each Taser X26P issued to Police includes an integrated camera to record all deployments of the device as well as any additional video while the device&#x27;s safety is switched off. The grip used by police may result in no video footage being available; however, audio footage is still &quot;loud and clear&quot;. This is due, for safety reasons, to the grip being the same as that used to hold the glock pistol.

The majority of officers carry their equipment on a leather or cordura duty appointment belt. In recent times, there has been a large movement within the police to implement changes in methods of equipment carry to relieve officers with back injuries. This has ranged from trials of lightweight nylon duty belts (such as the shapeshifter &quot;gel belt&quot;), to thigh holsters for firearms and load-bearing equipment vests. As of 2010, the load-bearing vest has become increasingly prevalent among general duty officers and it is anticipated that this trend will continue. It is believed that the vests are effective in relieving officers of chronic back pain, as it takes most of the weight away from the waist and back area, and distributes it across the frontal area of the officer&#x27;s torso. In 2017, a new load-bearing vest was introduced the Integrated Light Armour Vest (ILAV) that is level 2 ballistic rated and level 2 stab resistance rated which can be worn without armour and has the option of a hydration pack and a backpack. Also in 2017, a new covert vest was introduced the Covert Light Armour Vest (CLAV).

==Fleet==
===Vehicles===

NSW Police has the largest government fleet in Australia, with more than 4,000 vehicles, on a lease basis. Historically, the Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon and Ford Territory traditionally made up the bulk of general duties response vehicles in the fleet. With the end of local production by Holden and Ford however, general duties response vehicles are now made up of Volkswagen Passats, Volkswagen Tiguans and Holden ZB Commodores. A small number of Toyota LandCruiser 300s and Mitsubishi Pajero&#x27;s are also used as response vehicles in regional areas. The Ford Ranger, Holden Colorado and Hyundai iLoad are used as caged vehicles or &quot;paddy wagons&quot;, while Volkswagen Tiguan Allspaces are used as Dog Unit vehicles.

Highway Patrol vehicles usually consist of a combination of marked and unmarked vehicles, including the BMW 530d, BMW X5, Chrysler 300 SRT, and a smaller number of Toyota LandCruiser 200 for regional areas.

A large fleet of road motorcycles are also used, consisting of the BMW R1250RT and Yamaha FJR1300. A small number of trail bikes are also used for off-road duty. Other specialist sections and units use a variety of vehicles including Iveco Daily and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans, along with a range of Isuzu trucks as specialist rescue and bomb disposal vehicles and two Lenco BearCat armoured trucks.

===Aircraft===

The NSW Police &quot;Pol Air&quot; fleet is currently composed of 8 aircraft – five helicopters and three fixed-wing aircraft:

Helicopters: Polair 1–5
* 1 – 2020 Bell 429 (VH-PHW)
* 2 – 2017 Bell 412EPI (VH-PQZ)
* 3 – 2020 Bell 429 (VH-PHB)
* 4 – 2020 Bell 429 (VH-PHM)
* 5 – 2014 Bell 412EP (VH-PHZ)

Fixed-wing aircraft: Polair 6–8
* 6 – single-engine turboprop Cessna 208B Caravan (VH-DVV)
* 7 – single-engine turboprop Cessna 208B Caravan (VH-DFV)
* 8 – single-engine turboprop Cessna 208B Caravan (VH-DQV)

The aircraft are equipped with modern technology and specialist equipment including rescue winches, Nite sun searchlights (30 million candle power), forward-looking infrared (FLIR), high definition video camera system, microwave down-linking of live pictures, digital radio communications and advanced integrated touch screen digital glass cockpits with global positioning satellite (GPS) navigation systems.

The fixed wing Cessna 206H aircraft, callsign Polair 6, is primarily used for aerial speed enforcement along major freeways and highways in the State. It is also used to transport officers and assist with search operations in remote areas of the State.

The much larger Cessna 208 Grand Caravan, callsign Polair 7, provides Police with a long-range, heavy lift capability allowing for the transport of cargo, specialist equipment and personnel during extensive search and rescue incidents, which is ideal for use in remote locations across the state.
Various other fixed-wing aircraft such as a leased Cessna 500 have been used for major operations including the APEC Australia 2007 security operation. Another was also used during the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.

===Vessels===

NSW Police Force, Marine Area Command has its main base at Balmain on Sydney Harbour and others at Broken Bay, Newcastle, Port Stephens, Coffs Harbour, Botany Bay, Port Kembla and Eden. It has 123 operational water police, marine intelligence unit, marine crime prevention officer, divers, detectives and the marine operational support team, and employs six civilian engineers and 30 deck hands.

The current fleet consists of 11 seagoing craft, including OPV &quot;Nemesis&quot;, the largest purpose-built Police boat in the Southern Hemisphere, and a number of smaller boats. In January 2013 seven new &quot;class 4&quot; Rigid-hulled inflatable boat watercraft were rolled out across the state to Balmain, Botany Bay and Broken Bay. The new rigid-hulled inflatable boat have two 250 hp four-stroke outboard motors, with a speed of and a range of at , and are fitted with the latest navigation and communication equipment.

==Recruitment, training and ranks==

===NSW Police Academy, Goulburn===

The NSW Police academy is situated on 40 hectares of land in Goulburn, in the Southern Tablelands of NSW, located 200 kilometres south of Sydney.

The Academy buildings are extensive, consisting of 80 training facilities such as lecture theatres, classrooms, virtual weapons training facility, live-fire indoor pistol range, a simulation training venue, scenario village, library, indoor and outdoor physical fitness areas, coin-operated laundry facilities and Charles Sturt University Wi-Fi access. The Police Driver Training Complex is located approximately 5 km from the main Academy and comprises about 80 hectares of land, including specialist training facilities. The Goulburn Academy also boasts recreation and common room facilities, the Police Shop, Police Bank with ATM, St Michael&#x27;s Police Chapel and access to a range of amenities available in the township of Goulburn. There are about 1000 people on site each day, including police officers, policing students, Charles Sturt University staff and contractors. Accommodation facilities consist of 816 single residential rooms, 30 motel style units, 10 flats and houses. Catering and cleaning are provided by external contractors, with the dining room serving approximately 2,000 meals daily.

Located in the Memorial and Honour Precincts, the Academy has a number of memorials dedicated to the proud traditions of NSW Police, namely the Walls of Remembrance at the College Chapel (which features on the north side those who have died on duty, and those who have served in war and peacekeeping operations featured on the south side); the rose garden and eternal flame; the NSW Police horse &amp; dog memorial; and Heroes&#x27; Walk (featuring 15 bravery banners including George Cross, Cross of Valour, Star of Courage and George Medal police recipients). The latest aspect to the &quot;proud traditions project&quot; was the installation of the NSW Police academy peacekeeping display. The display features a range of memorabilia and photographs from peacekeeping missions to which NSW Police have contributed. The display also features the Dag Hammerskjold Medal belonging to the late Sergeant Ian Ward, on loan from the AFP.

===Application and training===
NSW Police applicants must have enrolled in and completed the University Certificate in Workforce Essentials (UCWE), a four-week course run by Charles Sturt University, which introduces students to communication, resolving conflict with communication skills, legal framework, crime and policing, writing documents, ethical practices, cultural diversity, leadership and teamwork, workplace practices and obligations, technology, personal resilience, and safe driving.

After completing the UCWE, a First Aid Certificate and a Swim Rescue Test, an applicant can submit their Police Application. Upon receipt of the Police Application, applicants undergo a number of background checks including detailed background vetting, employment checks and a thorough investigation of an applicants history.

Applicants then undergo a physical assessment, a medical assessment and, potentially, a face to face interview with a 3 person panel. Applicants are then ranked and selected to attend the Goulburn Police Academy based on their scores.

The Goulburn Police Academy program begins with eight weeks of online lectures from home (Session 1 Block 1), before students attend the academy for six weeks of further training (Session 1 Block 2). Students then take part in a one week placement in a Police Area Command. Students then return to Goulburn for a further 16 weeks of training (Session 2).

An important part of students&#x27; training includes the use of weapons and police tactics. Students are trained in weaponless control, where they learn to apply defensive and restraining techniques in appropriate situations. Students are trained in the use of Police appointments, including handcuffs, batons, capsicum spray and tasers. Students are also trained in the use of the Glock 22 service pistol. Students must be able to demonstrate positive weapons handling, marksmanship and a detailed understanding of the justifiable use of a firearm in accordance with the NSW Police policy. Students are then faced with simulation training, where they&#x27;re required to demonstrate effective communication skills and operational tactics in a simulated initial response situation, while also demonstrating a professional and ethical understanding of legal use of force.

Following the completion of Session 2, students receive an offer of employment from the NSW Police Force. They must then complete a further 42 weeks of online training (Sessions 3, 4 and 5) before finally graduating as a police officer.

In total, students receive 73 weeks of training, combining theory and practical skills ranging from shooting to driving. Following graduation, officers continue to maintain their skills through regular training and recertification, along with the ability to gain further specialist qualifications and skills in Specialist Police commands.

===Rank structure===
NSW Police is run on a community policing model. All sworn members start at the lowest rank of Probationary Constable / Constable. Promotion beyond Senior Constable is highly competitive. The following ranks are listed lowest to highest from left as set out in 2002.


====Constables====
All grades of constable perform the same basic range of duties, with the rank only reflecting experience. The rank of Probationary Constable is held for the first 12 months of service. After 12 months of satisfactory service and completing the associate degree of Policing Practice via distance education, the Probationary Constable is confirmed as Constable. 

Promotion to the rank of Senior Constable is not merit-based and can be obtained after five years of service and requires the officer to pass an examination that can cover a broad area of policing knowledge. Promotion to Incremental Senior Constable is also not merit-based and is obtained after 10 years of service. Senior Constables of all grades are called either &quot;Senior Constable&quot; or &quot;senior&quot;. 

Leading Senior Constable is a merit-based rank that primarily sees an officer in a training role and belongs to a specific unit or duty type of which there is a limited number with progression to such being competitive and non-transferable. If an LSC transfers from a unit or duty type (such as from highway patrol to general duties or vice versa), they revert to their original Senior Constable rank. To be eligible for LSC, an officer must have at least seven years&#x27; service, be Senior Constable and undergo many tests and selection processes in competition with other applicants.

====Non-commissioned officers====
Promotion to the rank of Sergeant and beyond is achieved by way of a merit-based promotion system whereby officers undertake a series of &quot;pre-qualification assessments&quot; and are placed on a ranked list before gaining promotion. Officers who qualify for a promotion list are given an eligibility mark and are ranked according to order of merit from the highest mark to the lowest. This means that the highest-ranked member on the promotions list will be considered first for the rank and position concerned. Members seeking placement on a promotion list must have spent the requisite time at the rank below, which is at least two years, and must have successfully completed the relevant pre-qualifying assessment examinations, an applicant evaluation and must meet the eligibility program. A new promotion list for each rank or grade is prepared each year, and an applicant who does not accept promotion can remain on a list only for three years before having to requalify for the list. On promotion to Sergeant and Senior Sergeant members are issued a warrant of appointment under the Commissioner&#x27;s hand and seal.

A Sergeant normally supervises a team of Constables during a shift. A Detective Sergeant is normally in charge of a team of detectives in a specific part of a local command or a specialist squad in the State Crime Command.

Incremental Sergeant, referred to simply as &quot;sergeant&quot;, is not a rank or merit-based but a pay scale increment based on service. An incremental sergeant wears a small crown above the chevrons indicating that they have reached the highest pay scale step in the rank of Sergeant.

Senior sergeants are generally attached to &quot;regions&quot; as region training coordinators, region traffic coordinators, region operations coordinator positions or in legal services, professional standards, protocol, education services and perform middle-management duties.

====Commissioned officers====
On completing at least three years but usually more as a sergeant and the relevant assessments, including an exam and interview, an officer may be appointed to the rank of &quot;Inspector&quot; and issued a certificate of commission under the Commissioner&#x27;s hand and seal. Commissioned officers may be acknowledged by the rank they hold or, more commonly, as &quot;sir&quot;, &quot;ma&#x27;am&quot; or &quot;boss&quot;.

An Inspector oversees and manages sergeants and teams of constables and performs administrative work, coordination of policing operations or specialist work. At Police Area Commands, an Inspector is allocated to each shift as a &quot;Duty Officer&quot; who oversees the general running of the Police Station (more often than not their tasks and roles are delegated to the supervising Sergeants on shift).

Superintendents are usually &quot;commanders&quot; of Police Area Commands or specialist units.

Assistant Commissioners are generally &quot;commanders&quot; of regions or corporate portfolios.

As of 2010, the rank of Senior Assistant Commissioner had been dispensed with. Officers currently holding that rank will retain it until retiring or upon promotion to a higher rank.

====Honorary Commissions====
In July 2014, the then Commissioner of the NSW Police, Andrew Scipione, bestowed the honorary rank and title of &quot;Governor&quot; of the NSW Police upon the then Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, for her service to the NSW Police. Subsequent governors have been appointed to this honorary rank. The Governor of the NSW Police can wear the uniform of commissioned officer of the NSW Police with the rank insignia being the State Badge surmounted by a crown.

====Detectives====
The path to becoming a NSW Police designated Detective is lengthy and requires extensive additional training. After a minimum of 3 years in uniform if an officer wishes to become a detective and undertake criminal investigation (CI) duties then they must first apply to undertake a rotation of at least 3 months in a detective&#x27;s office. During this rotation the officer will work with senior detectives who will evaluate their performance and suitability for CI duties. At the conclusion of this secondment an officer is given a formal assessment where they are evaluated in all aspects of their investigative performance. If they meet the required benchmark score then the officer will become eligible to sit an oral examination by a panel of high ranking Detective Inspectors and Detective Sergeants. This gruelling exam is formally called the Potential Detectives Recruitment Exam (PDRE) but is universally known as the &#x27;bull ring&#x27;. If an officer passes their &#x27;bull ring&#x27; then they are entered into a pool of officers who are eligible to compete against each other for any CI positions when they are periodically advertised across the police force. If an officer applies for, and wins, a permanent CI position then after a period of 6 months of experience they are permitted to undertake the Detectives Education Programme (DEP) and then the Detectives Designation Course (DDC). These courses involve extensive additional training, examinations and assessments in advanced criminal investigation, complex evidence law and criminal trial processes. These courses take a combined 12 to 18 months to complete. After the successful completion of the DEP and DDC the officer is awarded the designation of &quot;Detective&quot;. As it is a designation and not a rank, the designation comes prior to the rank (e.g., Detective Constable, Detective Senior Constable, etc.). Detectives receive one of the highest specialist pay allowances within the NSWPF in recognition of their increased responsibilities, training and experience. The higher rate of pay adds to the generally (but not always) good natured friction between detectives and general duties (uniform) officers.

Detectives can transfer back to general duties (uniform) or to another section within the NSWPF, this is common when seeking promotion or for career progression. However, when a detective transfers outside of an authorised full-time investigation position, detectives are not permitted to use their designation and must refer to themselves by their rank without adding &#x27;Detective&#x27; at the front of it. When a detective transfers out of CI they also lose their specialist pay allowances. Upon returning to an authorised CI position, they can again use their designation of &#x27;Detective&#x27; without having to requalify.

From December 2020, designated detectives now receive a unique police badge different to all other NSW Police. The badge has the same NSW Police crest but unlike the standard NSW Police badge it has no coloured rank backing plate and has the words “New South Wales Police Force” above and “Detective” below. Again, when a detective transfers out of CI they must return their detective&#x27;s badge.
==Honours and awards==
Recognition for the bravery and sacrifice of NSW Police is expressed through honours and awards. The NSW Police was the first Australian Police organisation to have one of its members awarded the Imperial honour George Cross and the Australian Cross of Valour. Sergeant 3rd Class Eric George Bailey GC was awarded the George Cross posthumously on 12 January 1945. The NSW Police also has the distinction in having one of its members being awarded the highest civilian bravery award, namely the Cross of Valour. Only five people have received the Cross of Valour with a NSW Police officer being the first Australian Police Officer to do so. On 3 May 1996, then Detective Senior Constable Sparkes rescued a boy trapped in a flooded underground storm water drain following record rainfalls at Coffs Harbour.

===Australian honours and awards===
NSW Police are eligible for the following national honours and awards:
* Australian bravery decorations, namely the Cross of Valour (CV), Star of Courage (SC), Bravery Medal (BM) and the Commendation for Brave Conduct
* Australian Police Medal (APM) 
* Police Overseas Service Medal
* National Police Service Medal
* National Medal
* Campaign Medals such as United Nations Medal For Service

===Internal NSW Police honours and awards===
NSW Police has a number of its own Honours and Awards awarded by the Commissioner which are highly prized, in part, because they are only awarded to in small numbers with the vast amount going to non uniformed officers. In 2002, then commissioner, Ken Moroney AO APM implemented the Commissioner&#x27;s Community Service Commendation and Community Service Citation.

====NSW Police commendations and medals====

The above in-service decorations are worn 5 mm below the officer&#x27;s name plate and are right-sided decorations.

====NSW Police citations====
The following in-service decorations are worn 5 mm above the officer&#x27;s name plate and are right-sided decorations.
* Unit Citation (maximum three further awards are indicated by silver stars) – metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with light blue enamel centre. This award is rarely awarded to uniformed officers.
* Commissioner&#x27;s Community Service Citation (maximum one further award indicated by one silver star) – metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with white enamel centre.

In 2000, then commissioner, Peter Ryan QPM implemented the Olympic Commendation and the Olympic Citation which was given out in large numbers for the contributions by members of the force to the Sydney 2000 Olympics, claimed as the &quot;Safest Games in modern Olympics history&quot;. NSW Police is the only police organisation in the world to be permitted the Olympic Rings to be attached.

==Peacekeeping==
In peacekeeping operations, officers are seconded to the Australian Federal Police and take an oath or affirmation of the AFP. They are then appointed to the rank of Senior Sergeant, Station Sergeant, Superintendent or Commander. Following their service, UN peacekeeping veterans are awarded the United Nations Medal for their particular mission. In addition, under the Australian system of honours and awards, Police officers serving with peacekeeping organisations are awarded the Police Overseas Service Medal with the relevant clasp for the prescribed area of service. As of 2008, two clasps to that medal were awarded to members for operations in Cyprus and East Timor.

===Cyprus (UNFICYP)===
Members were among the first Australian Police sent to Cyprus in May 1964 as the first UN Police contingent. The UN Civilian Police (now known as UNPOL or United Nations Police) was established with a three-months&#x27; mandate to end hostilities between the Greek and Turkish communities and promote peace on the island. The operation is ongoing.

Members were subsequently withdrawn from Cyprus in 1976, along with all other State and Territory Police following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on 20 July 1974. During the invasion and preceding it the Australian Police were subject to machine gun and mortar fire and Turkish air attack. Some of their personal motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal items at that time were destroyed, lost or stolen. Fortunately, there was no loss of Australian lives at that time. Australian Police continued to negotiate between the invading Turkish army, other warring parties and escorted refugees to safety from both sides. Since UNFICYP commenced, a large number of the NSW Police has served in Cyprus alongside other Australian police jurisdictions.

===East Timor (UNTAET and UNMISET)===
From 2000 to 2005, 45 NSW Police were involved in the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) seconded to the Australian Federal Police for their Tour of Duty in East Timor with the United Nations. There have only been three female NSWP officers to serve.

In addition, two NSW Police have been commended for courage for peacekeeping in East Timor, one by the Australian government, and the Australian Federal Police Commissioners Commendation for Bravery (station sergeant David McCann OAM – UNMISET and one by the commissioner (senior sergeant Mark Aubrey Gilpin – UNTAET). McCann was awarded the Commendation for Brave Conduct for his part in the rescue of 110 vulnerable persons from a village in East Timor after it suffered major flooding. Gilpin was awarded the NSW Police Commendation (courage) for his part in protecting a member of the community who was being subjected to mob justice. He placed his body in front of the mob, which were armed with machetes and other weapons, and managed to extract the victim to safety.

Out of the 10 Australian peacekeepers who have died on peacekeeping missions, two were NSW Police serving with UNFICYP. Sergeant Ian Ward and Inspector Patrick Hackett died in separate incidents in UNFCYP. A total of 124 soldiers and police gave their lives while serving with the UN in Cyprus.

==Controversies==

In 2020, Senior Constable Andrew Murphy was attached to Strike Force Raptor; a unit tasked with disrupting, dismantling and investigating OMCG activity in NSW was found &#x27;not currently suitable for contact with the general public&#x27; after an altercation with a female driver during a vehicle stop. The officer had previously come to public notoriety after being filmed multiple times interacting with OMCG members. The officer was eventually referred to by their name / identification tag; Raptor 13.

In June 2021 Friendlyjordies producer Kristo Langker was arrested by officers from the Fixated Persons Unit and charged with two counts of stalking and intimidating John Barilaro after Langker had approached Barilaro at different events. Langker&#x27;s lawyer Mark Davis contested the police&#x27;s accounts, and he denounced the timing of the arrest being soon after the defamation lawsuit commenced. He also criticised use of the Fixated Persons Unit, a counter-terrorism unit set up in the wake of the Lindt Cafe siege. In August 2021 it was revealed that Barilaro had been in contact with the Fixated Persons Unit regarding Shanks for at least six months prior to Langker&#x27;s arrest. This contradicted what Barilaro had earlier told Sky News Australia host Tom Connell, saying that he had not requested the Fixated Persons Unit become involved in the matter.

In November 2022, NSW police were speaking with well known activist Danny Lim. During the incident the attending Police attempted to arrest Lim and through use of excessive force caused serious injuries requiring hospitalisation. As of December 2022 this matter is still being investigated with regards to the lawfulness of the arrest and the subsequent injuries with the officers involved suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.

=== Drug detection dogs and strip searches ===
Following the introduction of a controversial law in 2001, NSW Police were given the power to deploy drug detection dogs at major public events such as music festivals, inside licensed premises (venues that serve alcohol) and at stations across the Sydney Trains network.

A report published by the New South Wales Ombudsman in 2006 found that 74% of searches resulting from drug detection dog indications carried out over a two-year review period had failed to locate any illicit drugs. The report concluded that “Overwhelmingly, the use of drug detection dogs has led to public searches of individuals in which no drugs were found, or to the detection of (mostly young) adults in possession of very small amounts of cannabis for personal use”. Subsequent figures obtained from NSW Police in 2023 revealed that between 1 January 2013 and 30 June 2023, officers had conducted 94,535 personal searches (refers to both strip searches and less invasive frisk or  &quot;general&quot; searches) resulting from drug detection dog indications, with only 25% resulting in illicit drugs being found.

In late 2014, reports were first published alleging that NSW Police were routinely using drug detection dog indications as a justification for conducting invasive strip searches, particularly at major events such as music festivals. At these events, officers have employed the use of structures such as ticket booths, tents, makeshift partitions and police vans to conduct these searches. In some cases, it’s been alleged that these structures did not offer adequate privacy to individuals being searched, leaving them exposed to other attendees or officers outside. After stripping partially or completely naked, individuals have reportedly been asked to do things such as lift their breasts or genitals, bend over, spread their buttocks apart or squat and cough. Similar searches have reportedly been conducted during drug detection dog operations at train stations and licensed venues as well.

Data obtained from NSW Police shows that between 1 July 2014 and 30 June 2020, officers had conducted 27,835 strip searches &quot;in the field&quot; (outside of a police station). Separate data shows that during the same six-year period, officers had conducted 5659 strip searches resulting from drug detection dog indications.

In October 2018, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission launched a formal investigation into the use of strip searches by NSW Police. In a final report handed down in December 2020, the Commission found that &quot;a recurrent issue throughout the inquiry was the failure of officers to comply with, or at least to properly account for their compliance with, the legal thresholds for conducting a strip search&quot;. In several cases investigated by the Commission, it was found that officers had acted unlawfully. The commission also noted that there had been a &quot;significant increase&quot; in the &quot;number and proportion&quot; of strip searches carried out following drug detection dog indications in the five years between 2014 and 2019.

In July 2022, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of New South Wales on behalf of patrons strip searched at music festivals by NSW Police from July 2016 onwards. The class action was launched by law firm Slater and Gordon in partnership Redfern Legal Centre. Head plaintiff for the class action is a then 27-year-old woman who was allegedly strip searched at the Splendour in the Grass music festival in 2018. It’s alleged that the woman was stopped by a drug detection dog before being taken to an area where several “makeshift cubicles” had been setup by police. After patting her down, it’s alleged that a female officer asked her to expose her breasts before instructing her to take off her pants and underwear and remove a tampon from her body. It’s also alleged that a male officer walked into the cubicle where the woman was being searched while she was bent over and naked from the waist down.

In December 2023, the NSW Government was unsuccessful in a bid to have the class action &quot;declassed&quot;, with Supreme Court Justice Peter Garling ruling that the matter should continue as a class action instead of being split into individual cases. A trial for the class action is expected to be held in mid-2025.

=== Tasering of Clare Nowland ===

In 2023, a NSW Police officer tasered a 95-year-old woman, Clare Nowland, twice at an aged care home in Cooma. Police claim Nowland had a knife. Nowland had dementia and used a mobility walker. The electric shocks caused Nowland to fall and fracture her skull. Nowland died in hospital one week later. The event caused significant public outcry and a critical incident investigation was launched into the conduct of the NSW Police involved and the use of force by NSW Police. The officer who tasered Nowland was charged with grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault. The NSW government has refused to release the results of the investigation. It was subsequently claimed that NSW Police covered up the use of a taser in early media statements concerning the incident despite a draft statement including mention of a taser.

===Use of racial categories===
NSW Police have been criticised for using racial categories to describe the appearances of alleged criminals, offenders, suspects, victims and missing persons but its use is as conferred with representatives from the then Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Ethnic Communities Council of NSW and various community groups in 1999): and its policy guidelines on the use of ethnicity based descriptors.

* &quot;Asian appearance&quot;
* &quot;Aboriginal appearance&quot; 
* &quot;Black/African appearance&quot; 
* &quot;White/European appearance&quot;
* &quot;Indian/Pakistani appearance&quot; 
* &quot;Pacific Islander appearance&quot;
* &quot;South American appearance&quot;
* &quot;Middle Eastern/Mediterranean appearance&quot;

<text>Vice-Admiral Sir John Lockhart-Ross, 6th Baronet (11 November 1721 – 9 June 1790), known as John Lockhart from 1721 to 1760, was an officer of the Royal Navy who saw service during the War of the Austrian Succession, Seven Years&#x27; War, and the American War of Independence, and served for a time as a Member of Parliament.

Lockhart was born into a gentry family in 1721 and embarked on a naval career. He served on a number of ships during the War of the Austrian Succession, seeing action at both the First and Second Battles of Cape Finisterre, having by then risen to the rank of lieutenant. He had his own commands by the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, and enjoyed particular success as a frigate captain, cruising against privateers while in command of . Further commands followed, including roles in detached squadrons at the Battle of Quiberon Bay. Taking the additional name Ross after he inherited a deceased relative&#x27;s estates, he served as a member of parliament and undertook land reforms and improvements during the years of peace before the outbreak of the American War of Independence.

Lockhart-Ross returned to sea on the outbreak of war, commanding a ship at the Battle of Ushant, and later being promoted to flag rank. He served in several actions as a junior commander of Rodney&#x27;s fleet, including the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the relief of Gibraltar. He then retired ashore, devoting himself to his estates until his death in 1790. He was succeeded in the baronetcy he had inherited in 1778 by his son.

==Family and early life==
Lockhart was born on 11 November 1721 at Lockhart Hall, Lanarkshire, the fifth son of Sir James Lockhart, 2nd Baronet. His mother, Grizel, was the third daughter of William Ross, 12th Lord Ross. Lockhart joined the navy in September 1735, serving first aboard the 50-gun under Captain Henry Osborne. He transferred to the 50-gun under Captain Charles Knowles in the West Indies between 1737 and 1738, and went on to serve aboard the 54-gun under Captain Henry Medley in 1739, and the 14-gun sloop under Captain Frogmere in 1740. Lockhart followed Frogmere to several of his ships, serving under him aboard the 20-gun and then the 54-gun . He passed his lieutenant&#x27;s examination on 28 September 1743, and received his commission with a posting on 21 October that year to the 44-gun in the North Sea, and afterwards on the coast of North America. While serving on the North American station he was moved into the 50-gun and returned to England with her in late 1746.

Lockhart&#x27;s next appointment was to the 66-gun in April 1747. &quot;Devonshire&quot; was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Peter Warren, under whom Lockhart saw action at the First Battle of Cape Finisterre on 3 May 1747. He was then appointed to his first command, that of the fireship , in which he saw action with Sir Edward Hawke&#x27;s fleet at the Second Battle of Cape Finisterre on 16 October 1747. One of the captains in the battle, Thomas Fox of the 64-gun , was later relieved of his command after controversy over his actions in the engagement, and Lockhart was given temporary command of &quot;Kent&quot; in his place. During 1748 Lockhart was first lieutenant of the Portsmouth guardship , and for the next few years was on half pay in Scotland. In January 1755 he was appointed first lieutenant of the 90-gun with Captain Charles Saunders, and on 22 April 1755 he was promoted to command the 8-gun sloop , attached during the year to the western squadron cruising under the command of Sir Edward Hawke or Vice-Admiral John Byng.

==Command==

On 23 March 1756 Lockhart was posted to the 28-gun , which he commanded for several cruises in the Channel, capturing several large privateers of equal or superior force, among them the 22-gun &quot;Cerf&quot; with 211 men, the 26-gun &quot;Grand Gideon&quot; with 190 men, and the 20-gun &quot;Mont-Ozier&quot; of Rochelle with 170 men. Lockhart was severely wounded in the capture of the &quot;Mont-Ozier&quot; on 17 February 1757, and had to be invalided on shore for the next two months. He rejoined the &quot;Tartar&quot; and on 15 April, off Dunnose, Isle of Wight, he captured the 26-gun &quot;Duc d&#x27;Aiguillon&quot; of St. Malo with 254 men; and on 2 November the 36-gun &quot;Melampe&quot; with 320 men. The latter ship was added to the navy as the 36-gun frigate .

As a reward for Lockhart&#x27;s services, the Admiralty offered him the command of the 50-gun , which was then nearing completion, and making several promotions from &quot;Tartar&quot;″s crew. He was also presented by the merchants of London and of Bristol with pieces of plate &#x27;for his signal service in supporting the trade;’ and by the corporation of Plymouth with the freedom of the borough in a gold box. Lockhart spent the next few months recuperating at Bath and waiting for the &quot;Chatham&quot; to be launched. She was duly launched in April 1758 and Lockhart took command, taking many of his officers and men from &quot;Tartar&quot; to crew her, with the Admiralty&#x27;s permission. Lockhart had her fitted for sea by May, and spent June to September cruising against privateers in the North Sea.

&quot;Chatham&quot; was then ordered into the Channel and later joined the fleet under Sir Edward Hawke. She spent the summer under Rear-Admiral George Brydges Rodney, taking part in the Raid on Le Havre before rejoining Hawke in October, and then being sent to join a squadron under Commodore Robert Duff, to watch the French in Quiberon Bay. The squadron observed the French fleet sail out, and were chased by them as they rushed to report the news to Hawke. Hawke brought his fleet against them and decisively defeated them at the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. Four days later Hawke appointed Lockhart to command in the place of Captain John Campbell, who was sent home with the despatches. In the end of January 1760 the &quot;Royal George&quot; came to Spithead, and a month later Lockhart was appointed to command the 64-gun , forming part of the fleet under Hawke or Edward Boscawen.

==Later naval and parliamentary career==

With the death of his brother James in September 1760 Lockhart succeeded to the Ross estate of Balnagown, the entail of which obliged him to take the name of Ross; this he formally did in the following spring, announcing the change to the admiralty on 31 March 1761. He was then at Lockhart Hall, where he seems to have passed the winter on leave, but afterwards rejoined the &quot;Bedford&quot; during the summer. In September he applied to be relieved from the command, and on 27 September was placed on half pay. In the previous June he had been elected member of parliament for Lanark Burghs, but it does not appear that he took any active interest in parliamentary business. He devoted himself principally to the improvement of his estates and the condition of the peasantry, and became known as &#x27;the best farmer and the greatest planter in the country; his wheat and turnips showed the one, his plantation of a million of pines the other&#x27;. He was MP for Lanark Burghs from 1761 to 1768 and in 1762, he initiated land tenure reform which would later evolve into the Highland Clearances. He was MP for Lanarkshire from 1768 to 1774.

In 1777, when war with France appeared imminent, Ross returned to active service, and was appointed to the 74-gun , joining the fleet under Admiral Augustus Keppel in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. On 13 August, by the successive deaths of his elder brothers without male issue, he succeeded to the baronetcy. On 19 March 1779 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and during the summer, with his flag in the &quot;Royal George&quot;, he was fourth in command in the Channel. In September he was sent with a small squadron into the North Sea to look out for John Paul Jones, but Jones, after capturing the &quot;Serapis&quot; in 1779, made good his escape. Continuing in the Channel Fleet, Ross was with Rodney at the capture of the Caracas convoy, the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the relief of Gibraltar in January 1780; with George Darby at the relief of Gibraltar in April 1781; and with Lord Howe during the early summer of 1782. On the return of the fleet to Spithead in August he resigned his command, and had no further employment afloat. He became a vice-admiral on 24 September 1787, and died at Balnagown Castle in Ross-shire on 9 June 1790. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Dundas of Arniston, the younger, in 1762 and had a number of children. Among them was his eldest son, Charles Lockhart-Ross, an army officer who inherited the baronetcy on his father&#x27;s death, and George Ross, father of distinguished legal writer George Ross.

<doc id="563679" wikidata="Q890223" url="?curid=563679" title="Boeing X-45">
<text>The Boeing X-45 unmanned combat air vehicle is a concept demonstrator for a &quot;next generation&quot; of completely autonomous military aircraft, developed by Boeing&#x27;s Phantom Works. Manufactured by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, the X-45 was a part of DARPA&#x27;s J-UCAS project.

==Development==
Boeing developed the X-45 from research gathered during the development of the Bird of Prey. The X-45 features an extremely low-profile dorsal intake placed near the leading edge of the aircraft. The center fuselage is blended into a swept lambda wing, with a small exhaust outlet. It has no vertical control surfaces — split ailerons near each wingtip function as asymmetric air brakes, providing rudder control, much as in Northrop&#x27;s flying wings.

Removing the pilot and its associated facilities from the aircraft dramatically reduces the aircraft&#x27;s cost. Ground-based pilots execute the higher level decisions, but the mechanical flying of the aircraft is autonomous.

==Variants==

===X-45A===
Boeing built two of the model X-45A; both were scaled-down proof-of-concept aircraft. The first was completed by Boeing&#x27;s Phantom Works in September 2000. The goal of the X-45A technology demonstrator program was to develop the technologies needed to &quot;conduct suppression of enemy air defense missions with unmanned combat air vehicles.&quot; The first generation of unmanned combat air vehicles are primarily planned for air-to-ground roles with defensive air-to-air capabilities coupled with significant remote piloting.

The X-45A had its first flight on May 22, 2002, and the second vehicle followed in November of that year. On April 18, 2004, the X-45A&#x27;s first bombing run test at Edwards Air Force Base was successful; it hit a ground target with a inert precision-guided munition. On August 1, 2004, for the first time, two X-45As were controlled in flight simultaneously by one ground-based pilot.

On February 4, 2005, on their 50th flight, the two X-45As took off into a patrol pattern and were then alerted to the presence of a target. The X-45As then autonomously determined which vehicle held the optimum position, weapons (notional), and fuel load to properly attack the target. After making that decision, one of the X-45As changed course and the ground-based pilot authorized the consent to attack the simulated antiaircraft emplacement. Following a successful strike, another simulated threat, this time disguised, emerged and was subsequently destroyed by the second X-45A. This demonstrated the ability of these vehicles to work autonomously as a team and manage their resources, as well as to engage previously-undetected targets, which is significantly harder than following a predetermined attack path.

After the completion of the flight test program, both X-45As were sent to museums, one to the National Air and Space Museum, and the other to the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where it was inducted on November 13, 2006.

The X-45A introduced yaw axis thrust vectoring.

===X-45B/C===

The larger X-45B design was modified to have even more fuel capacity and three times greater combat range, becoming the X-45C. Each wing&#x27;s leading edge spans from the nose to the wingtip, giving the aircraft more wing area, and a platform very similar to the B-2 Spirits&#x27;. The first of the three planned X-45C aircraft was originally scheduled to be completed in 2006, with capability demonstrations scheduled for early 2007. By 2010, Boeing hoped to complete an autonomous aerial refueling of the X-45C by a KC-135 Stratotanker. Boeing has displayed a mock-up of the X-45C on static displays at many airshows.

The X-45C portion of the program received $767 million from DARPA in October 2004, to construct and test three aircraft, along with several supplemental goals. The X-45C included an F404 engine. In July 2005, DARPA awarded an additional $175 million to continue the program, as well as implement autonomous aerial refueling technology.

On March 2, 2006, the US Air Force decided not to continue with the X-45 project. However, Boeing submitted a proposal to the Navy for a carrier based demonstrator version of the X-45, designated the X-45N.

===X-45N===
The X-45N was Boeing&#x27;s proposal to the Navy&#x27;s Unmanned Combat Air Systems demonstration project. When it became known that the US Air Force would end funding to the Joint Unmanned Combat Air System program (which included the X-45 and X-47), the US Navy started its own UCAS program. Requirements were defined over the summer of 2006, and proposals were submitted in April 2007.

The first flight of the X-45N was planned for November 2008, had Boeing won the contract. The contract was eventually awarded to Northrop Grumman&#x27;s proposed naval X-47, thus ending the X-45 program.

As of 2007, the software Boeing developed to allow the X-45N to land and takeoff autonomously on aircraft carriers had been installed on the first F/A-18F, which has used it to perform tests of autonomous approaches. All autonomous approaches ended with a wave-off by design. This Super Hornet is expected to be able to hook the carrier&#x27;s arrester cables autonomously by the 2009 timeframe, setting the stage for carrier-borne UAV operations.

===Phantom Ray===
Boeing planned to develop and demonstrate an unmanned flying test bed for advanced air system technologies. The internally funded program, called Phantom Ray, uses the X-45C prototype vehicle that Boeing originally developed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)/U.S. Air Force/U.S. Navy Joint-Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS) program. The UAV was not aimed at any particular program or competition.

<doc id="563681" wikidata="Q1197149" url="?curid=563681" title="Terranigma">
<text>is a 1995 action role-playing game developed by Quintet for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), with manga artist Kamui Fujiwara acting as the character designer. The game tells the story of the Earth&#x27;s resurrection by the hands of a boy named Ark, and its progress from the evolution of life to the present day. The game is the second entry in an unofficial trilogy of action role-playing games created by Quintet, also including &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Granstream Saga&quot; (1997).

&quot;Terranigma&quot; was published in Japan by Enix on October 20, 1995, and in Europe and Australia by Nintendo starting in December 1996; the game was not released in North America due to Enix having already closed its U.S. branch by the time localization had finished, and has not been re-released due to complicated issues relating to its rights. The game has been met with critical acclaim for its presentation, gameplay, and story, although it has been criticized for its difficulty.

==Gameplay==

The game keeps a top-down perspective view of the world and utilizes an action-based real-time battle system that allows the player to perform different techniques depending on whether the protagonist is running, jumping, attacking, or using a combination of these three actions. Each attack is meant for dealing more damage to certain kinds of enemies, though in most cases there is little to no difference regardless of the technique used. Projectiles launched at Ark can be blocked by the guard technique, which is otherwise ineffective against melee attacks.

With each victory, experience points are gained, increasing the protagonist&#x27;s level and his maximum hit points, strength, defense, and luck. Slain enemies sometimes leave behind gems which can be used to buy weapons, armors, healing items, and spells. There are no magic points in the game; all spells take the form of one-time use items instead. The player must collect Magirocks and take them to a magic shop to have them transformed into magic rings and summon medals. Those items are used up when casting the corresponding spell and then turn back to Magirocks which may be exchanged for new spells again. Upon defeating bosses and completing miscellaneous tasks, new types of magic become available.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting and characters ===

In &quot;Terranigma&quot;, the planet is portrayed as a hollow sphere (though the map in the game is mathematically a torus) that has both an external and internal face. Since the beginning of the Earth, the external Lightside, the surface world, stood for growth whereas the internal Darkside, the underworld, represented decline. Over the course of billions of years, these two forces came to be called God and Devil. Regardless of this inner antagonism, rapid progress took root and primitive life forms evolved to plants, animals, and humans. Technology and industry further expanded civilization, but the fight between God and the Devil was still taking place, more fiercely than ever. The conflict culminated in a final battle in Antarctica, on the surface world, but neither of the two forces was victorious. The continents of the surface world submerged into the sea and the underworld was sealed away.

=== Plot ===

The first chapter of the game, &quot;The Outset&quot;, introduces Ark, a mischievous boy who lives in Crysta, the only village in the underworld. After opening a forbidden door and touching a mysterious box containing a friendly demon named Yomi, every citizen in the village is frozen. The only person not affected by the curse, the Elder, guides him to resurrect the continents of the surface world in order to unfreeze the people. For the first time ever, a human being leaves Crysta to explore the underworld, which is portrayed as a frozen wasteland of imposing crystal mountains and rivers of magma. He conquers the trials of the five towers, each representing one continent, and revives the mainland of the Earth. Upon returning to his hometown, the Elder instructs him to travel to the surface world and to resurrect all living beings. Ark says goodbye to his lifelong devoted friend Elle and sets out to the Lightside. 

In the second chapter, &quot;Resurrection of the World&quot;, after having crossed a dimensional crevasse, Ark is confronted with the barren land that was once the Earth&#x27;s surface. His first task is to free the giant tree Ra from a parasite that is afflicting him. This causes the resurrection of all plants in the world, helping Ark to cross the mountains of Guiana. He travels further into the world, reviving birds, the wind, animals, and eventually mankind.

In the third chapter, &quot;Resurrection of the Genius&quot;, the Elder appears to Ark in a dream and tells him to keep helping humanity grow, as the world is still in the fledgling stages. He continues his journey, travelling and expanding cities, assisting with the invention of groundbreaking technologies, and also—much to his surprise—encountering a Lightside twin of Elle, who lives as the adopted daughter of a French king but was rendered mute by a traumatic event in her childhood. Ark manages to break this condition, and over time Princess Elle begins to grow close to him. In continuing to follow the Elder&#x27;s commands, Ark ultimately awakes the ingenious Beruga, a scientist who survived the destruction of the previous world by hiding himself in cryogenic sleep. Beruga provides Ark with an insight into his personal image of paradise: a perfect world where all insignificant life is killed with a virus named Asmodeus and everyone else is made immortal by turning them into zombies. Ark tries to attack Beruga after this revealing twist but is stopped by robots, injuring him severely in the process.

The Elder once again appears to him, saying that his mission is fulfilled and he may now pass away. Ark realizes that he has been used by Dark Gaia (the &quot;Devil&quot;), whose plans of world domination required Ark to resurrect the planet. Just as he is about to die, Kumari, a wise human who watched the world&#x27;s growth through reincarnation, teleports Ark out of Beruga&#x27;s laboratory. He then instructs him to go search the five Starstones and to lay them at the grave at Time&#x27;s End in order to call the Golden Child. Ark obtains the stones one after another and sets them into skull statues at Dryvale, the location at the South Pole where the final confrontation between God and the Devil once took place. This leads to the appearance of Ark&#x27;s Lightside self; the person Dark Gaia used to create Ark himself. His Lightside self reveals to him that he, the underworld Ark, is the legendary hero and then kills him. 

However, in the fourth and final chapter, &quot;Resurrection of the Hero&quot;, Ark is reborn as a baby through the soul of the surface world, Light Gaia. He is kidnapped by Darkside Elle, who was led there by Yomi to eliminate a threat to Crysta. When she realizes this threat is actually Ark, she allows him to awaken as the legendary hero and grow back into an adult in the process. Yomi then decides to kill Ark by himself and reveals he has been working for Dark Gaia all along. He fails, as Darkside Elle sacrifices herself to kill Yomi and save Ark&#x27;s life. Yomi is conveniently replaced by a &quot;Light Version&quot;.

Afterward, Ark departs to defeat Beruga. After he conquers the professor, he returns to the underworld to defeat Dark Gaia. The victory over that entity brings forth the destruction of the Darkside. In the end, Ark realizes that as a creation of Dark Gaia, he, along with the village of Crysta and the underworld, shall now vanish with the Devil&#x27;s demise, though it is implied he and his loved ones in Crysta will be reincarnated. He goes to sleep, after being told by Light Gaia that he, as creator and defender, is what the humans would call a god. Ark&#x27;s last dream pictures him as a bird flying above the world that he helped to exist, watching it grow older. An epilogue plays which shows Lightside Elle at her original home. There is a knock at the door, and she answers it. The game then ends.

==Development==
&quot;Terranigma&quot; was developed by the Japanese company Quintet, which had previously designed creation-themed Super NES games such as &quot;ActRaiser&quot; and &quot;Soul Blazer&quot;. It is considered to be part of an unofficial trilogy with the games &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; and &quot;Soul Blazer&quot;. This series is nicknamed either &quot;Quintet Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Gaia Trilogy&quot; or &quot;Heaven and Earth Trilogy&quot; (after &quot;Terranigma&quot;″s Japanese title, which translates to &quot;the creation of Heaven and Earth&quot;) by fans. On the other hand, according to the producer of Enix USA, there is no connection between &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; and &quot;Gaia&quot;, but the former title is related to &quot;ActRaiser&quot;. Therefore, the &quot;Gaia trilogy&quot; includes &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot;, &quot;Terranigma&quot;, and &quot;The Granstream Saga&quot;. 

Publisher Enix commissioned the developers as a subcontractor and decided for the title to be an action role-playing game for strategic reasons, based on Quintet&#x27;s experience in that particular genre and the good reception of their earlier games by Japanese players.

The theme of creation prevalent in &quot;Terranigma&quot; was introduced as a contrast to the destruction of enemies in other action titles, and to inspire the player&#x27;s imagination concerning the effects their actions might have. The script was written by director and designer Tomoyoshi Miyazaki, the founder of Quintet, with the scenario provided by Reiko Takebayashi. Tatsuo Hashimoto created the computer graphics cover art and also rendered the background images for the resurrection scenes.

The music of &quot;Terranigma&quot; was composed by Miyoko Takaoka and Masanori Hikichi, the latter of whom was responsible for the design of the sounds as well. Yuzo Koshiro, who had previously composed the soundtrack for &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, contributed the music for the laboratory area, but did not get credited. The English scripts of the game used in the European and Australian releases by Nintendo were translated by Colin Palmer, Dan Owsen, Hiro Nakamura and Nob Ogasawara.

== Release ==
&quot;Terranigma&quot; was first previewed in mid-1995 and slated for an October launch window. Early previews prior to release showcased several differences compared to the final version such as the ability to climb the five towers outside using claws, different room layouts and plant decorations around the HUD. It was first released in Japan on October 20, 1995, by Enix for the Super Famicom under the name &quot;Tenchi Sōzō&quot;. The title was then released in Europe on December 19, 1996, by Nintendo. It was also released in Spain in April 1997 and in France on the summer of 1997. The game wound up never being published in North America because Enix had already closed its US subsidiary by the time the localization was finished.

&quot;Terranigma&quot; was released alongside several pieces of merchandise in Japan, including an official guide book, a world atlas, a novel by Saori Kumi, a novelization by Norio Nakai titled &quot;Logout Bunko Tenchi Sōzō&quot;, a gamebook featuring artwork by character designer Kamui Fujiwara, and the two-volume manga &quot;Gangan Fantasy Comics: Tenchi Sōzō&quot; by Mamiko Yasaka. Except for the guide book, none of these materials have been released outside Japan, though Club Nintendo published a 32-page comic illustrating scenes from the game up to the events of the third chapter in Germany. A Japanese soundtrack album titled &quot;Tenchi Sōzō Creative Soundtracks&quot;, with 33 compositions and six arranged tracks of the game&#x27;s music, was released by Kitty Enterprises on October 25, 1995.

A petition by the game&#x27;s Japanese fanbase, backed by artist Kamui Fujiwara and co-composer Miyoko Takaoka, began in July 2021 to either re-release or remaster &quot;Terranigma&quot;. This fan-led effort renewed speculation on the status of the rights to Quintet&#x27;s games. According to Fujiwara, Quintet president Tomoyoshi Miyazaki had &quot;disappeared&quot; to his knowledge; he speculated this was why the rights to republish the game were complicated, that Miyazaki was not available for contact.

== Reception ==
&quot;Terranigma&quot; garnered acclaim from critics. &quot;GameFan&quot;″s Kei Kuboki described it as Quintet&#x27;s &quot;best (...) effort&quot; and being &quot;among the [Super NES&#x27;s] most memorable titles&quot;. The game holds a 74.14% rating based on seven reviews at review aggregator GameRankings, and was given the &quot;Silver Hall of Fame&quot; award from &quot;Famitsu&quot;. It received a 23.3 out of 30 score in a public poll taken by &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot;. Quintet reported that 200,000 copies were sold in Japan.

&quot;Famitsu&quot;″s four reviewers gave &quot;Terranigma&quot; a score of 30 out of 40. Likewise, &quot;The Super Famicom&quot;″s three reviewers gave it a 78 out of 100 scores. &quot;MAN!AC&quot;″s Robert Bannert praised its atmospheric world, characters, stereo soundtrack, map design and sophisticated controls, regarding it as a good game in the Japanese action-adventure tradition. &quot;Total!&quot;″s Michael Anton commended its varied locations, soundtrack, ease of play, and plot but several aspects such as the difficulty level were criticized. Nevertheless, Anton recommended the title for fans of the action-adventure genre, stating that it would tide over fans until the release of &quot;Lufia II&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;″s Paul Davies gave high remarks to its controls, artwork, music, presentation, and storytelling, regarding it as an outstanding addition to the SNES&#x27; action-adventure role-playing game library &quot;with a powerful message&quot;. &quot;Mega Fun&quot;″s Rene Schneider gave positive comments to the graphics, music, controls and technical performance but criticized the game&#x27;s strategy guide for revealing many of the puzzles, lowering its fun factor.

&quot;Video Games&quot;″ Jan Schweinitz regarded it as a &quot;worthy successor&quot; to &quot;Zelda III&quot;. &quot;Superjuegos&quot;″s Marcos García also regarded &quot;Terranigma&quot; as one of the best and most ambitious action role-playing games for SNES, stating that it surpasses &quot;Illusion of Time&quot; and &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;. García commended the Spanish translation, visual quality, graphical effects and epic soundtrack. &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot;″s Roberto Lorente praised its mix of action and role-playing elements, stating that it surpasses &quot;Zelda&quot; while capturing its spirit. Lorente also gave high remarks to the Mode 7 maps, audio, controls and absorbing plot. &quot;Nintendo Acción&quot;″s Javier Abad gave very positive comments to the varied scenery, carefully crafted plot involving secondary storylines and freedom of movement but criticized its dungeon maps. In November 1997, in its 60th monthly issue, &quot;Nintendo Acción&quot; listed it as the 11th best game they had ever reviewed. &quot;Joypad&quot;″s Grégoire Hellot regarded the game to be interesting and entertaining, stating that &quot;&quot;Zelda&quot; fans will be in for a treat&quot;. &quot;Player One&quot;″s Christophe Pottier also stated that the game was excellent and &quot;technically perfect&quot; presentation-wise. Both Hellot and Pottier recognized the game&#x27;s quality but panned its late French release date, stating that it should have been published before &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;.

=== Retrospective coverage ===
&quot;Terranigma&quot; continues to be regarded as one of the best action role-playing games of its era. &quot;RPGFan&quot;″s Jeremy Tan considered it as &quot;one of Enix&#x27;s greatest Action RPG games ever&quot;, praising the fast-paced combat system, visual presentation, varied soundtrack and simple controls but lamented the lack of a North American release. &quot;1Up.com&quot;″s Jeremy Parish described it as Quintet&#x27;s best-known Super Nintendo action-RPG, noting the quality of the gameplay, music and deep story themes. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Corbie Dillard highly commended its easy-to-pick-up controls, graphics, emotional music score, sense of scale and evolving plot. &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot;″s Zashy regarded its graphical effects as among the most beautiful on SNES while giving positive remarks to the playability, longevity, soundtrack and storyline. Zashy noted that its difficulty can put some players off but nevertheless claimed that &quot;&quot;Terranigma&quot; will undoubtedly remain the title that marked the end of the reign of SNES in the most poetic way possible&quot;.

&quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Mike Moehnke noted its narrative to be interesting on a consistent basis and praised the varied locations, fast combat system and audiovisual presentation but criticized the low difficulty level and unnecessary magic system. Moehnke also questioned the lack of a North American release but regarded &quot;Terranigma&quot; as &quot;Quintet&#x27;s final hurrah on the SNES&quot; nevertheless. &quot;USgamer&quot;″s Nadia Oxford concurred and expressed disappointment with the lack of an official North American release due to the closure of Enix&#x27;s branch in the region and lack of a Virtual Console re-release but described its music as one of the best soundtracks on the SNES. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;″s David DiRienzo also agreed with the lack of a North American localization but regarded &quot;Terranigma&quot; as &quot;the best of&quot; both &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; and &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot;, commending its less restrictive design, &quot;Zelda&quot;-style dungeon maps, refined gameplay mechanics and music score but criticized the inconsistent visual presentation, cumbersome magic system and certain aspects of its plot. Regardless, DiRienzo stated that the title was one of the better action RPGs on SNES.

<doc id="563684" wikidata="Q457638" url="?curid=563684" title="The Pretender (TV series)">
<text>The Pretender is an American action drama television series created by Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle, that aired on NBC for four seasons from September 19, 1996, to May 13, 2000.

The series follows Jarod, a young man who is a &quot;Pretender&quot;, a genius impostor able to quickly master the complex skill sets necessary to impersonate a member of any profession. He was kidnapped as a child by The Centre, a sinister think tank located in the fictional Blue Cove, Delaware. It exploited his Pretender abilities, but Jarod escaped as an adult and goes on the run. He is chased by a trio of Centre agents—Miss Parker (the daughter of a pivotal figure within The Centre), Sydney (a Centre psychologist who raised Jarod) and Broots (a Centre computer expert). In each episode, Jarod assumes a new professional identity (such as a doctor, lawyer, soldier, pilot) to investigate a crime framed on someone else, and deliver justice to the actual culprits. In the meantime, Jarod searches for his origins, and leads Miss Parker, Sydney and Broots on a chase to discover the dark secrets of The Centre, including how they are involved in the death of Miss Parker&#x27;s mother.

The series was inspired by serial impostor Ferdinand Waldo Demara. It was a part of the network&#x27;s Saturday night lineup until its cancellation after four seasons. TNT ordered two sequel television films that aired in 2001—&quot;The Pretender 2001&quot; and &quot;The Pretender: Island of the Haunted&quot;. In 2013, creators Steven Long Mitchell and Craig W. Van Sickle began updating the story with a book series and graphic novels; the first, &quot;The Pretender: Rebirth&quot;, was published on October 7.

== Plot ==
Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) is a prodigy who is abducted very early and raised in a think tank called the Centre, based in the fictional town of Blue Cove, Delaware. Told that his parents have died, Jarod is assigned to the care of a man named Sydney (Patrick Bauchau), a psychiatrist working for the Centre. During Jarod&#x27;s youth, Sydney mentors the boy and regularly coaches him through complex simulations designed to exploit his intellect for real life application. But some years later, Jarod discovers that the Centre is using data gathered from his responses for nefarious purposes, such as illegal black ops and engineering the deaths of others. Feeling responsible, Jarod escapes the Centre. Soon afterward, he discovers that the people whom he had long believed to be his parents actually were not, as Jarod has an anomaly in his blood that a father or mother would share — which neither of his supposed parents do.

The Centre assigns a team to recapture Jarod, consisting of Sydney, computer expert Broots (Jon Gries), and &quot;Miss Parker&quot; (Andrea Parker), a dogged and formidable operative who was raised in the Centre and knew Jarod since always. Though she is no longer an active field operative, she is &quot;recalled from Corporate&quot; during the pilot episode and put in charge of Jarod&#x27;s recapture; in exchange, she would get to leave The Centre. While Sydney feels loyalty to Jarod and wishes his safe return, Miss Parker is under orders to &quot;preferably&quot; bring him in alive and will not hesitate to use deadly force. Fearing for Jarod&#x27;s safety, Sydney at times undermines Miss Parker and will directly prevent her from using lethal methods to prevent Jarod&#x27;s continued evasion of his pursuers. In the pilot, Parker questions Sydney&#x27;s commitment to the Centre, telling him he can be a scientist for the Centre or &quot;mommy&quot; to Jarod, but not both.

Despite The Centre&#x27;s resources, Jarod often stays a step or two ahead of his pursuers. While tracking down clues to his past and his parents, Jarod also targets criminals who have gone unpunished or undetected by the law. Through assumed identities (which involve different surnames, but always &quot;Jarod&quot; as a first name), he uncovers the truth about these crimes, and lures the perpetrators into staged set-ups that emulate the harm they have done to others, and forces them to confess their crimes. At times, he leaves Miss Parker and Sydney deliberate clues (&quot;breadcrumbs&quot;) that point to the criminals he is targeting and why. During his adventures, Jarod also discovers the joys of early life he was denied while being raised in isolation — such as bubblegum, ice cream, a Slinky, and Silly Putty — that are often used in these traps. Meanwhile, Miss Parker, Sydney, and Broots learn more about The Centre&#x27;s dark secrets, and how the institution was involved in the death of Miss Parker&#x27;s mother.

=== Series finale ===
Though Jarod learns more about his family, there are still unanswered questions when the series ends after four seasons. The series finale closed with Jarod and Miss Parker being nearby an exploding bomb. The ending did not reveal whether either survived the blast. The next year, the telemovie &quot;The Pretender 2001&quot; picked up directly from this cliffhanger, leading into Jarod&#x27;s next adventure.

== Themes ==
=== Loyalty ===
Loyalty is a recurring theme in the series. During the first season, Jarod sends Miss Parker evidence that she too has been manipulated by the organization, which is led by her father (&quot;Mr. Parker&quot;). Miss Parker discovers that she has been lied to about her mother&#x27;s death, and The Centre was actually involved in her death (which she had been told was suicide). Although her loyalty wavers on her quest for answers, and some specific periods – most notably during early season two, when her father disappears and is replaced by Mr. Lyle and Brigitte – it never completely falters.

Similarly, Sydney&#x27;s loyalty to The Centre wavers upon its actions. Having raised Jarod, Sydney feels a unique bond to Jarod, and is unwilling to harm him to recapture him. This rift increases when he discovers truths about what the organization – specifically Mr. Raines – has done to Jarod, other Pretender children, and his twin brother, Jacob, who is his only family.

=== Identity ===
Having been kidnapped as a young child and raised in The Centre, Jarod has little memory of his life before being taken by The Centre. He yearns to find the identity The Centre kept him from having, and to reunite with his family. Similarly, Miss Parker struggles with her identity throughout the series, after The Centre&#x27;s dark secrets affect her own family, such as learning she has a twin brother, and the circumstances surrounding the death of her mother.

She learns from Jarod that she was lied to about how her mother Catherine Parker had died. Further revelations are made concerning Miss Parker&#x27;s origins and her brother. This puts her in a parallel to Jarod&#x27;s quest of discovery, and at times her loyalty wavers, though it never falters.

== Production ==
The pilot was filmed in and around Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The building used as &quot;The Centre&quot; in transition sequences is the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant. Following the pilot, the series moved production to Los Angeles, California.

In the spring of 1999, the series was sold into syndication to TNT and The WB.

After the series was cancelled in May 2000, a fan campaign for the series to continue prompted negotiations involving the show&#x27;s creators and both NBC and TNT. In October 2000, TNT greenlit two television films – &quot;The Pretender 2001&quot; and &quot;Island of the Haunted&quot; – which aired on TNT in January and December 2001, respectively. However, both movies ended with an unresolved cliffhanger, and TNT opted not to order any more movies.

The creators of the show, Steven Mitchell and Craig van Sickle, stated that an ending was written for the series; they just needed financing to create it. In a September 2007 interview on the miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot;, Mitchell and van Sickle noted that fans were still requesting an ending and that it would happen &quot;soon&quot; due to a relationship with Strange Highway Entertainment. They also noted that the storyline would continue digitally on the World Wide Web. On May 21, 2008, van Sickle again expressed interest in having a final episode or film to finish the series, and asked fans to continue to be patient until it happens.

== Novels and rebirth of series ==
On July 8, 2013, it was announced through The Pretender Creators Facebook page that the series would be reborn. On July 19, the producers stated in an interview that they planned graphic novels and then a mini-series/movies.

The first Pretender novel, &quot;Rebirth&quot;, was released on September 22, 2013, in eBook and paperback through Amazon. The second Pretender novel, &quot;Saving Luke&quot;, was released on May 12, 2014, in eBook and paperback, also through Amazon.

==Home media==
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released all 4 seasons on DVD in Region 1 between 2005–2006. They also released the two &quot;Pretender&quot; movies together as a set on March 13, 2007. All 4 seasons were re-released on May 26, 2009, with new packaging.

All episodes from the first two seasons are available for purchase online through Amazon.com&#x27;s video on demand service.

== Thrillogy ==
Thrillogy was a short lived sci-fi/action programming block on NBC&#x27;s Saturday night that debuted in Fall of 1996 with three action/sci-fi series: &quot;Dark Skies&quot;, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, and &quot;Profiler&quot;. When &quot;Dark Skies&quot; was cancelled before the 1996–97 television season was over, NBC attempted to keep the Thrillogy block intact for the 1997–98 season by inserting the new series &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;. However, the series was cancelled after the airing of only two episodes, and NBC dropped the Thrillogy marketing. &quot;The Pretender&quot; and &quot;Profiler&quot; continued airing together on Saturday nights, earning respectable ratings for NBC.

At the midseason point of the 1999–2000 season, NBC reintroduced the Thrillogy lineup with the addition of paranormal series &quot;The Others&quot;. However, NBC cancelled the entire lineup at the end of the season. The Thrillogy concept aired for less than the equivalent of two full seasons over a four season period.

=== &quot;Profiler&quot; crossovers ===
Michael T. Weiss portrayed Jarod on the TV series &quot;Profiler&quot; during an NBC crossover event. The first half of the plot unfolded on &quot;The Pretender&quot; (season 3, episode 19 &quot;End Game&quot;), in which two lead characters from &quot;Profiler&quot;, Dr. Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Waters (Ally Walker) and Bailey Malone (Robert Davi) guest-starred. The conclusion takes place in an episode of &quot;Profiler&quot; (season 3, episode 19 &quot;Grand Master&quot;) in which Weiss guest starred; Jarod&#x27;s alias at the time is Jarod Doyle, a police officer.

Two additional crossovers took place the following season; Walker departed from the series, and was replaced with new profiler Rachel Burke (Jamie Luner). The first crossover takes place on &quot;The Pretender&quot; (season 4, episode 10 &quot;Spin Doctor&quot;) and concludes on &quot;Profiler&quot; (season 4, episode 10 &quot;Clean Sweep&quot;), where Jarod had a short lived romance with Burke. Weiss later appeared as Jarod on another episode of &quot;Profiler&quot; (season 4, episode 18 &quot;Pianissimo&quot;); however, &quot;The Pretender&quot; did not air another crossover episode.

<doc id="563687" wikidata="Q1162673" url="?curid=563687" title="Holter monitor">
<text>In medicine, a Holter monitor (often simply Holter) is a type of ambulatory electrocardiography device, a portable device for cardiac monitoring (the monitoring of the electrical activity of the cardiovascular system) for at least 24 hours.

The Holter&#x27;s most common use is for monitoring ECG heart activity (electrocardiography or ECG). Its extended recording period is sometimes useful for observing occasional cardiac arrhythmias which would be difficult to identify in a shorter period. For patients having more transient symptoms, a cardiac event monitor which can be worn for a month or more can be used.

When used to study the heart, much like standard electrocardiography, the Holter monitor records electrical signals from the heart via a series of electrodes attached to the chest. Electrodes are placed over bones to minimize artifacts from muscular activity. The number and position of electrodes varies by model, but most Holter monitors employ between three and eight. These electrodes are connected to a small piece of equipment that is attached to the patient&#x27;s belt or hung around the neck, keeping a log of the heart&#x27;s electrical activity throughout the recording period. A 12-lead Holter system is used when precise ECG information is required to analyse the exact origin of the abnormal signals.

==History==
The Holter monitor was developed at the Holter Research Laboratory in Helena, Montana, by experimental physicists Norman J. Holter and Bill Glasscock, who started work on radio telemetry in 1949. Inspired by a suggestion from cardiologist Paul Dudley White in the early 1950s, they redirected their efforts toward development of a wearable cardiac monitoring device. The Holter monitor was released for commercial production in 1962.

== Data storage ==

Older monitors used reel-to-reel tapes or C90 or C120 audio cassettes, moving at a 1.7 mm/s or 2 mm/s speed to record the data. The recording could be played back and analyzed at 60 times the recording speed, so 24 hours of recording could be analyzed in 24 minutes. Modern monitors record EDF-files on digital flash memory. The information is loaded on a computer, which counts ECG complexes; calculates summary statistics, such as average, minimum, and maximum heart rate; and finds parts of the recording that are worthy of further study.

==Components==
Each Holter system has hardware (called monitor or recorder) for recording the signal, and software for review and analysis of the record. There may be a &quot;patient button&quot; on the front that the patient can press at specific instants such as feeling/being sick, going to bed, taking pills, marking an event of symptoms which is then documented in the symptoms diary, etc.; this records a mark that identifies the time of the action on the recording. Advanced Holter recorders are able to display the signal, useful for checking the signal quality.

===Recorder===

The size of the recorder differs depending on the manufacturer of the device. The average dimensions of today&#x27;s Holter monitors are about 110x70x30 mm, but some are only 61x46x20 mm and weigh 99 g.

Most Holter Monitors monitor the ECG via two or three channels. Depending on manufacturer, different lead systems and numbers of leads are used; the number of leads may be minimised for patient comfort. Two or three channel recording has been used for a long time in the Holter monitoring history; 12-channel Holters were introduced later, using either the standard 12-lead electrocardiograph or the modified (Mason-Likar) exercise lead system. 

These Holters can occasionally provide information similar to that of an ECG stress test examination. They are also suitable when analyzing patients after myocardial infarction. Recordings from these 12-lead monitors are of a significantly lower resolution than those from a standard 12-lead ECG, and in some cases have been shown to provide misleading ST segment representation, even though some devices allow setting the sampling frequency up to 1000 Hz for special-purpose examinations such as detection of &quot;late potential&quot;.

Another innovation is the inclusion of a triaxial movement sensor, which records the patient&#x27;s physical activity and, on examination and software processing, extracts three movement statuses: sleeping, standing, or walking. Some modern devices can record spoken patient diary entries that can be listened to.

===Analyzing software===
After the recording of ECG signal for typically 24 hours, the signal must be analysed. A person would have to listen for the full 24 hours; instead integrated automatic analysis determines different sorts of heart beats, rhythms, etc. The success of the analysis is closely associated with the signal quality, which mainly depends upon the attachment of the electrodes to the patient&#x27;s body. Incorrect attachment allows electromagnetic disturbance to add noise to the record, particularly with rapid patient movement, impeding processing. Other factors can also affect signal quality, such as muscle tremors, sampling rate and resolution of the digitized signal (high quality devices offer higher sampling frequency).

The automatic analysis commonly provides the physician with information about heart beat morphology, beat interval measurement, heart rate variability, rhythm overview and patient diary (moments when the patient pressed the patient button). Advanced systems also perform spectral analysis, ischemic burden evaluation, graph of patient&#x27;s activity or PQ segment analysis. Also possible is the ability to monitor and analyse pacemaker impulse detection, useful for checking pacemaker function.

<text>Howard Percy &quot;Bob&quot; Robertson (January 27, 1903 – August 26, 1961) was an American mathematician and physicist known for contributions related to physical cosmology and the uncertainty principle. He was Professor of Mathematical Physics at the California Institute of Technology and Princeton University.

Robertson made important contributions to the mathematics of quantum mechanics, general relativity and differential geometry. Applying relativity to cosmology, he independently developed the concept of an expanding universe. His name is most often associated with the Poynting–Robertson effect, the process by which solar radiation causes a dust mote orbiting a star to lose angular momentum, which he also described in terms of general relativity.

During World War II, Robertson served with the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) and the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). He served as technical consultant to the Secretary of War, the OSRD Liaison Officer in London, and the Chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force.

After the war Robertson was director of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1952, chairman of the Robertson Panel on UFOs in 1953 and scientific advisor to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) in 1954 and 1955. He was chairman of the Defense Science Board from 1956 to 1961, and a member of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) from 1957 to 1961.

The Robertson crater on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor.

== Early life ==
Howard Percy Robertson, was born in Hoquiam, Washington, on January 27, 1903, the oldest of five children of George Duncan Robertson, an engineer who built bridges in Washington state, and Anna McLeod, a nurse. His father died when he was 15 years old, but although money was short, all five siblings attended university. He entered the University of Washington in Seattle in 1918, initially with the intention of studying engineering, but he later switched to mathematics. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics in 1922 and a Master of Science in mathematics and physics in 1923.

In 1923 Robertson married Angela Turinsky, a philosophy and psychology student at the University of Washington. They had two children: George Duncan, who became a surgeon, and Marietta, who later married California Institute of Technology (Caltech) historian Peter W. Fay. At the University of Washington he also met Eric Temple Bell, who encouraged him to pursue mathematics at Caltech. Robertson completed his PhD dissertation in mathematics and physics there in 1925 under the supervision of Harry Bateman, writing &quot;On Dynamical Space-Times Which Contain a Conformal Euclidean 3-Space&quot;.

Upon receipt of his doctorate, Robertson received a National Research Council Fellowship to study at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he met David Hilbert, Richard Courant, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, Martin Schwarzschild, John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner. He found Max Born unsympathetic to his concept of an expanding universe, which Born considered &quot;rubbish&quot;. He also spent six months at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he was a post-doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld.

== Mathematics ==
Robertson returned to the United States in 1927, and became an assistant professor of mathematics at Caltech. In 1928, he accepted a position as an assistant professor of mathematical physics at Princeton University, where he became an associate professor in 1931, and a professor in 1938. He spent 1936 on sabbatical at Caltech. His interest in general relativity and differential geometry led to a series of papers in the 1920s that developed the subject.

Robertson wrote three important papers on the mathematics of quantum mechanics. In the first, written in German, he looked at the coordinate system required for the Schrödinger equation to be solvable. The second examined the relationship between the commutative property and Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle. The third extended the second to the case of &quot;m&quot; observables. In 1931 he published a translation of Weyl&#x27;s &quot;The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics&quot;.

It was Robertson&#x27;s anonymous 1936 critical peer review of a paper submitted by Albert Einstein to &quot;Physical Review&quot; which caused Einstein to withdraw the paper from consideration.

Yet perhaps Robertson&#x27;s most notable achievements were in applying relativity to cosmology. He independently developed the concept of an expanding universe, which would imply distant galaxies as seen from Earth would be redshifted – a phenomenon previously confirmed by Vesto Slipher
. Robertson went on to apply the theory of continuous groups in Riemann spaces to find all the solutions that describe the cosmological spaces. This was extended by Arthur Geoffrey Walker in 1936, and is today widely known in the United States as the Robertson–Walker metric.

One of Robertson&#x27;s landmark papers, a brief note in &quot;The Annals of Mathematics&quot;, entitled a &quot;Note on the preceding paper: The two body problem in general relativity&quot;, solved that problem within a degree of approximation not improved on for several decades. Earlier work, such as the Schwarzschild metric, were for a central body that did not move, while Robertson&#x27;s solution considered two bodies orbiting each other. Nevertheless, his solution failed to include gravitational radiation, so the bodies orbit forever, rather than approaching each other.

Yet Robertson&#x27;s name is most often associated with the Poynting–Robertson effect, the process by which solar radiation causes a dust mote orbiting a star to lose angular momentum. This is related to radiation pressure tangential to the grain&#x27;s motion. John Henry Poynting described it in 1903 based on the &quot;luminiferous aether&quot; theory, which was superseded by Einstein&#x27;s theories of relativity. In 1937, Robertson described the effect in terms of general relativity.

Robertson developed the theory of invariants of tensors to derive the Kármán–Howarth equation in 1940, which was later used by George Batchelor and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in the theory of axisymmetric turbulence to derive Batchelor–Chandrasekhar equation.

== World War II ==
Aside from his work in physics, Robertson played a central role in American scientific intelligence during and after World War II. He was approached by Richard Tolman shortly after World War II began in 1939, and began working for the Committee for Passive Protection Against Bombing. This was absorbed with other groups into Division 2 of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), with Robertson engaged in the study of terminal ballistics.

In 1943, Robertson became the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) chief scientific liaison officer in London. He became close friends with Reginald Victor Jones, and Solly Zuckerman praised the work Robertson and Jones did on scrambling radar beams and beacons. In 1944 Robertson also became a technical consultant to the Secretary of War, and the chief of the Scientific Intelligence Advisory Section at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. His fluency in German helped him to interrogate German scientists, including rocket scientists involved in the V-2 rocket program. He was awarded the Medal for Merit for his contributions to the war effort.

== Later life ==
After the war, Robertson accepted a professorship at Caltech in 1947. He would remain there for the rest of his career, except for long periods of government service. He was a Central Intelligence Agency classified employee and director of the Weapons System Evaluation Group in the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 1950 to 1952, and scientific advisor in 1954 and 1955 to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), General Alfred M. Gruenther. In 1953 he chaired the Robertson Panel, which investigated a wave of UFO reports in 1952. He was chairman of the Defense Science Board from 1956 to 1961, and a member of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) from 1957 to 1961.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, serving as its foreign secretary from 1958 until his death in 1961, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Mathematical Society, the American Physical Society, the American Astronomical Society, the American Philosophical Society, the Operational Research Society, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

In August 1961, Robertson was hospitalized after being injured in a car accident. He suffered a pulmonary embolism and died on August 26, 1961. He was survived by his wife and children. His papers were donated to the Caltech Archives by his daughter and son-in-law in 1971.

<doc id="563692" wikidata="Q5598800" url="?curid=563692" title="Great Boston Fire of 1872">
<text>The Great Boston Fire of 1872 was Boston&#x27;s largest fire, and still ranks as one of the most costly fire-related property losses in American history. The conflagration began at 7:20 p.m. on Saturday, November 9, 1872, in the basement of a commercial warehouse at 83–87 Summer Street. The fire was finally contained 12 hours later, after it had consumed about of Boston&#x27;s downtown, 776 buildings and much of the financial district, and caused $73.5 million in damage (equivalent to $ billion in ). The destruction to the buildings was valued at $13.5 million and the personal property loss was valued at $60 million. At least 30 people died, including 12 firefighters.

==Underlying causes==
=== Building practices ===

In 1872, there was no strictly enforced building code in Boston. The streets were narrow and the buildings were close together. Many of the buildings were too tall for fire ladders to reach the upper levels, and the pressure from the fire hoses was often insufficient to extinguish flames on the roofs of the buildings. Thus, the fire could spread from rooftop to rooftop, and across narrow streets. Many of the affected buildings were made of brick and stone, but with wooden framing. Also, wooden mansard roofs were a common architectural trend of the time period. The steep pitch of a mansard roof allows for more storage in the upper levels of a building. However, these roofs are flammable due to their wooden construction.

=== Insurance ===
Building owners in Boston had few incentives to implement fire-safety measures. Buildings were often insured above value or at full value.

=== Fire alarm boxes ===

In 1852, Boston became the first city in the world to install telegraph-based fire alarm boxes. The boxes served as a fire warning system. If the lever inside of the alarm box was pulled, the fire department was notified, and the alarm could be traced back to the box via a coordinate system so that firefighters were dispatched to the correct location. All of the fire alarm boxes were kept locked from when the system was installed in 1852 until after the Great Fire of 1872 to prevent false alarms. A few citizens in each area of Boston were given a key to the boxes, and all other citizens had to report fires to the key-holders, who could then alert the fire department. In 1872, witnesses watched the fire spread before the area&#x27;s key-holder was found and could unlock the alarm box to alert the Boston Fire Department. Twenty minutes after the fire was first noticed, firefighters arrived on the scene.

=== Water infrastructure ===
John Damrell, Boston Fire Department&#x27;s chief engineer at the time, had told Boston officials that the existing water infrastructure was inadequate. He was told not to &quot;magnify the needs of his department&quot; after requesting funding for water infrastructure repairs. The existing water main pipelines were old and leaky, making the pressure in the pipes lower than acceptable. There were not enough hydrants throughout the city to adequately cover the surrounding buildings. As the fire spread, firefighters struggled to find hydrants with adequate water pressure. Also, the fire hydrant couplings were not standardized within Boston, making it more difficult for firefighters to connect their hoses and related equipment.

=== Horse sickness ===
The Boston fire department used horses to pull fire engines, hoses, and ladders. At the time of the 1872 fire in early November, the northeast United States was experiencing an epizootic equine flu that affected and weakened the horses. When Damrell heard of the horse sickness he preemptively hired an additional 500 men to replace the horsepower that would typically haul the engines and other equipment to the sites of fires. After the fire, the city commission in charge of investigating the fire concluded that the response time of the fire department was only delayed by a few minutes in the absence of the horses.

=== Similarities to Great Chicago Fire ===
In 1871, Chicago suffered massive destruction and an estimated 300 casualties in the Great Chicago Fire. Damrell, along with fire chiefs from various large cities, traveled to Chicago after the fire in an attempt to learn from the city&#x27;s mistakes. Like Boston, Chicago buildings were made primarily of wood and building codes were not enforced, making the densely developed neighborhoods susceptible to fire. General Phil Sheridan, in charge of military relief in Chicago post-fire, did not condemn the city&#x27;s use of gunpowder to blow up buildings to create firebreaks. In theory, a firebreak creates a gap in flammable material that serves as a barrier where the fire will run out of &quot;fuel&quot; to spread any further. However, many fire chiefs from Southern cities were firmly opposed to gunpowder-created firebreaks after having seen the destruction they caused in the Civil War. Damrell returned to Boston and continued to request funding for improved water infrastructure and fire equipment.

==Events of the fire==
Experts have deduced that the fire began in the basement of a warehouse on the corner of Kingston Street and Summer Street, at approximately 83–85 Summer Street. In this particular area, most of the buildings were dedicated to retail or used as warehouses. The warehouse that first caught fire housed dry goods. From the basement, the flames spread to the wooden elevator shaft in the center of the building and moved up the floors, fueled by the flammable fabrics in storage. Finally, the building&#x27;s wooden mansard roof caught on fire and the flames were able to spread from rooftop to rooftop down the street. The heat became so intense that stone facades shattered. The fire spread through most of Boston&#x27;s financial district which became known as the &quot;burnt district.&quot; The glow of the fire was noted in ships&#x27; logs by sailors off the coast of Maine. 
=== Timeline of events ===

Source:

* 7 pm, November 9: the fire begins in the basement of a warehouse.
* 7:24 pm, November 9: first alarm is received from Box 52.
* 8 pm, November 9: all 21 of Boston&#x27;s fire engines are at the scene of the fire.
* 10 pm, November 9: the fire spread to a three block radius.
* 12 am, November 10: the fire spread to a five block radius.
* 4 am, November 10: the fire spread to the waterfront, destroying wharves and docked boats.
* 6 am, November 10: the fire reached Washington Street and spread through the center of downtown.
* midday, November 10: the fire is stopped and contained before it destroys Old South Meeting House.

=== Fire department response ===
At 7:24 pm, the first alarm was received from Box 52 at the corner of Summer Street and Lincoln Street. The first fire engine to arrive was Engine Co. 7 from a station at 7 East Street. The first water on the fire came from Hose Company 2 of Hudson Street. By 8 pm, all of Boston&#x27;s 21 engine companies were fighting the fire. Telegraphs were sent to surrounding towns requesting help, but the messages were delayed due to most telegraph offices already having closed for the night. Eventually, support arrived from fire departments in every state of New England, except Vermont. Of these were two Amoskeag Steamers from Manchester, New Hampshire. One was the first Amoskeag ever constructed (serial number 1), owned by the Manchester Fire Department; the other was the first self-propelled Amoskeag that the manufacturer sent down. Impressed with its performance, Boston purchased the self-propelled steamer after the fire, the first one in use in the country.

=== Crowd control ===
During the fire, the narrow streets of Boston were packed with firefighters and their equipment as well as crowds of people. As building owners raced to retrieve valuables from their burning properties, looters ran in after them to collect whatever was left behind. Because the affected area was mostly commercial and not residential, spectators came from residential neighborhoods to watch the fire spread. Some historians estimate that over 100,000 bystanders watched the fire spread. The firefighters had to both extinguish the flames and keep people back from danger.

=== Gas lines ===
Gas supply lines connected to street lamps and used for lighting in buildings could not be shut off promptly. The gas still running through the lines served as fuel to the fire. Many of Boston&#x27;s gas lines exploded due to the fire.

=== Use of explosives ===
As the fire spread, citizens asked Mayor William Gaston to authorize the use of gunpowder to blow up buildings in the path of the fire to create a firebreak. Mayor Gaston approved the creation of firebreaks and groups of citizens began packing buildings with gunpowder kegs. However, the firebreaks were not effective. Instead, they caused injury to the citizens involved and the flaming debris from the exploded buildings spread to surrounding buildings. Eventually, Damrell had to force citizens to stop using gunpowder.
=== Conclusion ===
Citizens and firefighters alike worked to stop the fire. Along Washington Street, wet blankets and rugs were said to have been used to cover buildings to prevent the fire from spreading to the Old South Meeting House, the church in which the Boston Tea Party was planned. Some citizens and firefighters climbed to the roof of the meeting house to put out sparks. The efforts to save this historic landmark finally halted the fire at the corner of Washington and Milk Streets, around midday on November 10.

==Aftermath==
=== Fatalities ===
A total of 11 firefighters were killed—nine during the fire, with two more later dying from their injuries. Three were with the Boston Fire Department, three with Charlestown, two with Cambridge, and one each with Malden, West Roxbury, and Worcester. The number of civilians killed is uncertain, &quot;perhaps fifteen&quot;. Another source states &quot;at least 30 people died, including 12 firefighters.&quot;

=== Notable buildings destroyed ===
* &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, newspaper
* &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;, newspaper
* Shreve, Crump &amp; Low, a jewelry store, relocated from its original workshop to 225 Washington Street after the fire.
* Carter&#x27;s Ink Company
* Rice &amp; Hutchins, a shoe manufacturer and distributor at 125 Summer St.
* Trinity Church, 18th century Anglican colonial period church on Summer Street.
=== Rebuilding ===
Following the fire, a citizen-formed committee urged Boston to restructure the layout of roadways in the damaged areas. Boston officials approved of this proposal, and many downtown streets were re-established to be wider and straighter. Most notably, Congress Street, Federal Street, Purchase Street, and Hawley Street were widened. The restructuring allotted space to establish Post Office Square at the intersection of Milk, Congress, Pearl, and Water Streets. Some of the rubble from destroyed buildings was moved into the harbor to expand Atlantic Avenue. Because over-insurance of buildings was common, many businesses had enough insurance money to begin rebuilding soon after the fire. In less than two years, Boston&#x27;s financial district was rebuilt.

=== Economic effects ===
In the rebuilding that followed the fire, land values of the &quot;burnt district&quot; increased, according to a study in &quot;American Economic Review&quot; in 2017. The forced reconstruction of the financial district brought about widespread, simultaneous building upgrades and updates, and many properties were rebuilt to suit the commercial nature of the district. The widening of roads and re-assembly of land plots into larger parcels also contributed to the rise in land values.

=== John Stanhope Damrell ===

A new committee, the Fire Commission was established to oversee the Boston Fire Department and investigate the fire of 1872. John Damrell resigned from his position as chief engineer in 1874 in the wake of the Fire Commission&#x27;s investigation. He had served as chief engineer for eight years and worked as a professional firefighter in Boston since 1858. In 1874, Boston began replacing and repairing its water mains, one of Damrell&#x27;s main causes during his career. Damrell continued his career in firefighting and public safety. In 1873, he founded the National Association of Fire Engineers (NAFE, now called the International Association of Fire Chiefs, IAFC) and became the organization&#x27;s first president. He also served as a building inspector for the city of Boston.

==== Building code and inspection ====
While Damrell served as president of NAFE, the association published a list of eight fire safety concerns in building construction.

# Flammable and combustible building materials
# Excessive height buildings, beyond the reach of ground ladders
# Fire escapes
# Water supply
# Space between buildings
# Corridors and open stairways
# Fire alarms
# Fire department

In 1877, Damrell was appointed Boston&#x27;s building commissioner. He served the Department of Building Inspection for 25 years, until his son succeeded him. At the 20th Annual Convention of NAFE in 1892, Damrell is credited for Boston&#x27;s formally established limits of building height and area. At the time, Boston was the only American city with these limitations.

In 1884, Damrell petitioned the National Association of Fire Engineers to create a more formalized building code during his presentation of &quot;Building Code Report&quot; at a NAFE convention.

In 1891, The National Association of Commissioners and Inspectors of Public Buildings (NACIPB) was established by Damrell, and he served as the first president. He served a second term as president when he was re-elected at the organization&#x27;s annual conference in 1894.

A standardized building code wasn&#x27;t established until 1905, the year of Damrell&#x27;s death, when the National Board of Fire Underwriters published its &quot;National Building Code&quot;.

=== Remembrance ===
At the corner of Kingston and Summer Streets, a plaque was installed by The Bostonian Society to mark the start of the fire.

Old South Meeting House recognized the 138th anniversary of the fire in 2010 by displaying a partially restored Kearsarge fire engine.

Harvey W. Wiley took part in fighting the fire while he was a student at Harvard University. He later wrote about it in his autobiography.

Author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. watched the fire from his home on Beacon Hill. He wrote a poem about the event called &quot;After the Fire&quot;.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-85 (; USAF/DoD reporting name: &quot;Type 31&quot;, NATO reporting name: Barge) was a Soviet prototype strategic bomber based on the Tu-4, an unlicensed, reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. It was the ultimate development of the B-29 family, being over 50% heavier than its progenitor and had nearly double the range. Only two prototypes were built before the program was cancelled in favor of the turboprop powered Tupolev Tu-95 bomber which could cover the same range at a far higher speed.

==Development==
Neither the Tu-4 nor the Tu-80 were true intercontinental strategic bombers as they both lacked the range to attack the United States from bases in the Soviet Union and return. The Tu-85 was designed to achieve the necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel-efficient engines, a redesigned wing to increase the lift/drag ratio and the addition of more fuel. A large number of engines were considered before settling on the Shvetsov ASh-2K, essentially two air-cooled ASh-82 radial engines paired together and the liquid-cooled Dobrynin VD-4K six-bank inline engine, similar in configuration to the unsuccessful German Junkers Jumo 222. Both proposed powerplants were given turbochargers and power-recovery turbines to turn them into turbo-compound engines. The Shvetsov design was preferred, but was not yet mature enough for use, and the VD-4K was selected. A lot of effort was put into refining the design of the wing in collaboration with TsAGI. It had an aspect ratio of 11.745 and a taper of 2.93 for optimum lift at high altitudes. The Tu-85 carried of fuel in 48 flexible tanks.

Much of the armament and equipment was derived from those of the late-model Tu-4, including the four remotely-controlled and gun turrets and the tail turret, each with two Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon. But the Tu-85&#x27;s tail turret had an Argon range-only radar and each of the two bomb bays was enlarged to hold a FAB-9000 bomb.

Actual design work began in August 1948 and was ratified by a directive from the Council of Ministers dated 16 September that required the first prototype to be ready for manufacturer&#x27;s tests in December 1950. Construction of the first aircraft began in July 1950 and was completed in September. It first flew on 9 January 1951 and the manufacturer&#x27;s tests lasted until October. On 12 September the first prototype flew with a bombload of which it dropped en route, landing with enough fuel remaining to have covered a total of . The second prototype, sometimes referred to as the 85D () or 85/2, incorporated the lessons learned from the first aircraft, including revision and reinforcement of the airframe and a variety of changes to its equipment and systems. It was first flown on 28 June 1951 and its trials lasted until November. 

Series production was approved on 23 March 1951 at three factories where it would succeed the Tu-4 on the production line, but this was reversed later in the year and the program was cancelled; during the Korean War Soviet MiG-15s brought down many American B-29s, showing that there was no longer a future in aerial combat for piston-powered aircraft. Priority was given to the higher-performance turboprop Tu-95 &#x27;Bear&#x27;, as its own turboprop powerplants, the TV-12 prototype series for the Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprops that power the Tu-95 to this day, were already generating as early as 1951.

<doc id="563694" wikidata="Q1008943" url="?curid=563694" title="Gell-Mann matrices">
<text>The Gell-Mann matrices, developed by Murray Gell-Mann, are a set of eight linearly independent 3×3 traceless Hermitian matrices used in the study of the strong interaction in particle physics.
They span the Lie algebra of the SU(3) group in the defining representation.

==Matrices==

==Properties==

These matrices are traceless, Hermitian, and obey the extra trace orthonormality relation, so they can generate unitary matrix group elements of SU(3) through exponentiation. These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the Pauli matrices for SU(2) to SU(3), which formed the basis for Gell-Mann&#x27;s quark model. Gell-Mann&#x27;s generalization further extends to general SU(&quot;n&quot;). For their connection to the standard basis of Lie algebras, see the Weyl–Cartan basis.

===Trace orthonormality===

In mathematics, orthonormality typically implies a norm which has a value of unity (1). Gell-Mann matrices, however, are normalized to a value of 2. Thus, the trace of the pairwise product results in the ortho-normalization condition

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the Kronecker delta.

This is so the embedded Pauli matrices corresponding to the three embedded subalgebras of &quot;SU&quot;(2) are conventionally normalized. In this three-dimensional matrix representation, the Cartan subalgebra is the set of linear combinations (with real coefficients) of the two matrices formula_3 and formula_4, which commute with each other.

There are three significant SU(2) subalgebras:

*formula_5
*formula_6 and
*formula_7
where the and are linear combinations of formula_3 and formula_4. The SU(2) Casimirs of these subalgebras mutually commute.

However, any unitary similarity transformation of these subalgebras will yield SU(2) subalgebras. There is an uncountable number of such transformations.

===Commutation relations===

The 8 generators of SU(3) satisfy the commutation and anti-commutation relations

: formula_10

with the structure constants

: formula_11

The structure constants formula_12 are completely symmetric in the three indices. The structure constants formula_13 are completely antisymmetric in the three indices, generalizing the antisymmetry of the Levi-Civita symbol formula_14 of . For the present order of Gell-Mann matrices they take the values

:formula_15

In general, they evaluate to zero, unless they contain an odd count of indices from the set {2,5,7}, corresponding to the antisymmetric (imaginary) s.

Using these commutation relations, the product of Gell-Mann matrices can be written as

: formula_16

where is the identity matrix.

===Fierz completeness relations===

Since the eight matrices and the identity are a complete trace-orthogonal set spanning all 3×3 matrices, it is straightforward to find two Fierz completeness relations, (Li &amp; Cheng, 4.134), analogous to that satisfied by the Pauli matrices. Namely, using the dot to sum over the eight matrices and using Greek indices for their row/column indices, the following identities hold,
:formula_17
and 
:formula_18
One may prefer the recast version, resulting from a linear combination of the above,
:formula_19

==Representation theory==

A particular choice of matrices is called a group representation, because any element of SU(3) can be written in the form formula_20 using the Einstein notation, where the eight formula_21 are real numbers and a sum over the index is implied. Given one representation, an equivalent one may be obtained by an arbitrary unitary similarity transformation, since that leaves the commutator unchanged.

The matrices can be realized as a representation of the infinitesimal generators of the special unitary group called SU(3). The Lie algebra of this group (a real Lie algebra in fact) has dimension eight and therefore it has some set with eight linearly independent generators, which can be written as formula_22, with &quot;i&quot; taking values from 1 to 8.

===Casimir operators and invariants===

The squared sum of the Gell-Mann matrices gives the quadratic Casimir operator, a group invariant, 
:formula_23

where formula_24is 3×3 identity matrix. There is another, independent, cubic Casimir operator, as well.

==Application to quantum chromodynamics==
These matrices serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the gluon fields associated with the coloured quarks of quantum chromodynamics (cf. colours of the gluon). A gauge colour rotation is a spacetime-dependent SU(3) group element 
formula_25 where summation over the eight indices is implied.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-80 () was a Soviet prototype for a longer-ranged version of the Tupolev Tu-4 bomber, an unlicensed, reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. It was cancelled in 1949 in favor of the Tupolev Tu-85 program which offered even more range. The sole prototype was used in various test programs before finally being used as a target.

==Development==
The Tu-80 was designed as a modernized and enlarged Tu-4 with greater range. This was to be achieved by the use of more fuel-efficient engines, better aerodynamics and added fuel tanks. It was intended to have a range of and carry a maximum bombload of with a top speed of . Work began on the design in February 1948 and this was confirmed by a Council of Ministers order of 12 June that required the prototype be ready for State acceptance trials in July 1949.

The forward portion of the fuselage was redesigned with an airliner-style stepped windscreen and the fuselage was lengthened by almost which allowed the bomb bays and their doors to be lengthened. The radar and its operator were moved into the forward pressurized compartment and the radar itself was located in the &quot;chin&quot; position in a new streamlined fairing. The wings were enlarged to a total of and the rubber deicing boots were replaced by more efficient and aerodynamic bleed air deicers. The engine nacelles were redesigned with smaller cross-sections with less drag. Originally, Shvetsov ASh-2TK or Dobrynin VD-3TK engines were considered, but neither engine was ready so the Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN was used. Fully feathering propellers were also used. All of these changes increased the lift/drag ratio to 18 from the 17.0 of the Tu-4.

Construction of the Tu-80 began in November 1948, using as many Tu-4 components as possible to speed up construction, but the first flight was not until 1 December 1949, after the Council of Ministers had canceled the program on 16 September 1949 in favor of the Tu-85 which was expected to have much better performance. The Tu-80 became a research aircraft, testing reversible-pitch propellers and structural deformation in heavy aircraft, before eventually became a target on a bombing and gunnery range.

<text>&quot;Master Harold&quot;...and the boys is a play by Athol Fugard. Set in 1950, it was first produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre in March 1982 and made its premiere on Broadway on 4 May at the Lyceum Theatre, where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in South Africa during apartheid era, and depicts how institutionalized racism, bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard&#x27;s birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally&#x27;s, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family&#x27;s servants was similar to Hally&#x27;s as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called &quot;Master Harold&quot;, and he once spit in the face of one he had been close to. Additionally the play was remade for a suitable audience in 2005.

The play initially was banned from production in South Africa. It was the first of Fugard&#x27;s plays to premiere outside of South Africa.

==Plot== 
Servants Sam and Willie are practicing ballroom steps in preparation for a major competition, while maintaining Hally&#x27;s mother&#x27;s tea shop on a rainy day. Sam is the more worldly of the two. When Willie says his ballroom partner and girlfriend is lacking enthusiasm, Sam points out that Willie beats her every time she makes a mistake.

Seventeen-year-old Hally arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks about the dancing progress. Sam mentors the boy, wishing to guide him through adolescence into manhood, while Willie is the &quot;loyal black&quot;; who calls the white Afrikaner boy &quot;Master Harold&quot;.

The conversation between the three moves from Hally&#x27;s school-work, to an intellectual discussion on &quot;A Man of Magnitude&quot;, where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society, to flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a boarding house. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk. Hally wishes to write a story about that kite for school, but he feels the ending was too simple, as he recalls how he had sat on a park bench to watch the kite fly, while Sam quietly went back to work. Conversation then turns to Hally&#x27;s 500-word English composition, where they describe the ballroom dancing floor as &quot;a world without collisions&quot;; a transcendent metaphor for life.

Almost immediately, despair returns: Sam had early on mentioned why Hally&#x27;s mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in World War I, to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn&#x27;t well enough to be discharged, and that the call must&#x27;ve been about a bad turn, rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally&#x27;s mother at the hospital confirms that Hally&#x27;s father is manipulating the hospital into discharging him, although he is indeed not feeling any better than before, so it&#x27;s still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won&#x27;t happen. A second call from Hally&#x27;s mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally&#x27;s father is now home.

Hally is distraught about this news, since his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for constant treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump, and empty chamber pots of urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. But when Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him &quot;Master Harold&quot; and spitting on him, among other things. Sam is hurt and angry about this, and both he and Willie stop just short of attacking Hally, but they both come to understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain.

There is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end, when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, and maybe fly another kite, harkening back to the simple days of the other kite. Sam recalls the reason he had made that kite in the first place: Once, Hally&#x27;s father had passed out from drunkenness at a hotel bar, and young Hally and Sam had to fetch him, as Hally&#x27;s mother was unavailable to do so. Sam had to literally carry Hally&#x27;s unconscious father home on his back, while young Hally miserably followed, carrying his crutches. Sam took pity on young Hally&#x27;s shame and humiliation, and wanted to give Hally something to be proud of. In the present, Hally, horrified about what he&#x27;s done, is barely able to face Sam, responds without looking up &quot;It&#x27;s still raining, Sam. You can&#x27;t fly kites on rainy days, remember,&quot; and asks Willie to lock up the tea shop. Sam then gives Hally a twist ending to the kite story: the reason Sam left was because the bench Hally had sat on to watch the kite, had said &quot;Whites Only&quot; but young Hally had been too excited to notice it, but now, he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. Hally exits into the rain without response. The play ends with Sam and Willie consoling each other by using Willie&#x27;s bus fare to play the jukebox, and they ballroom dance together.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the play&#x27;s premiere at the Yale Repertory Theatre, Alan Stern wrote in The Boston &quot;Phoenix&quot; that:

John Simon, writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, was measured in his review:

Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the performance at the original Broadway premiere: Andy Propst of &quot;Time Out&quot; ranked it the 42nd greatest play of all time.

==Casting history==
The principal casts of notable productions of &quot;Master Harold... and the Boys&quot;

<text>The Tupolev Tu-75 () was a military transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, an unlicensed, reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The Tu-75 was similar to the Tu-70 airliner, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS decided it would be cheaper to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.

==Design and development==
The Tupolev OKB began work in September 1946 on a military transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).

The aircraft was intended for three different roles; transport, parachute transport and aerial ambulance. In the first role it was designed to carry two ASU-76 assault guns, two STZ NATI artillery tractors, six or seven GAZ-67B jeeps or five guns without their prime movers or any combination of equipment up to . To facilitate the loading of cargo, a winch was mounted on the ceiling of the cargo hold with a capacity of . It could carry either 120 troops, 96 fully loaded paratroopers or 64 standard parachute loads. As an aerial ambulance it could carry 31 stretchers and four medical attendants.

==Operational history==
Construction of the first prototype was quite prolonged; the aircraft was not finished until November 1949, with its first flight taking place on 21 January 1950. It finished its manufacturer&#x27;s trials the following May, but Tupolev decided not to submit it for the State acceptance trials as the Soviet Air Force had already decided that it would be cheaper to rely on its existing transports and to modify Tu-4 bombers for the cargo role. The prototype was used by the MAP ( – Ministry of Aviation Industry) until it crashed in October 1954.

<text>Newgrounds is an American company and entertainment website founded by Tom Fulp in 1995. The site hosts user-generated content such as games, films, audio, and artwork. Fulp produces in-house content at the headquarters and offices in Glenside, Pennsylvania.

In the 2000s, Newgrounds played an important role in Internet culture, and in Internet animation and independent video gaming in particular. It has been called a &quot;distinct time in gaming history&quot;, a place &quot;where many animators and developers cut their teeth and gained a following long before social media was even a thing&quot;, and &quot;a haven for fostering the greats of internet animation&quot;.

==Content==

User-generated content can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site&#x27;s four web portals: Games, Movies, Audio, and Art. A Movie or Games submission entered undergoes the process termed &quot;judgment&quot;, where it can be rated by all users (from 0 to 5 stars) and reviewed by other users. The average score calculated at various points during judgment determines if whether the content will be &quot;saved&quot; (added onto the database) or &quot;blammed&quot; (deleted with only its reviews saved in the &quot;Obituaries&quot; section).

Since Adobe Flash Player was shut down on most browsers by late 2020, Newgrounds uses the Ruffle emulator, an Adobe Flash emulator written in Rust and sponsored by Newgrounds along with other popular sites like Cool Math Games and Armor Games. In 2022, Ruffle supported most Flash content written in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, and only a select few Flashes written in 3.0, which meant to play then unsupported content, users had to use the &quot;Newgrounds Player&quot;, the site&#x27;s previous downloadable Flash end-of-life solution which it used prior to Ruffle for playing content.

Art and Audio are processed using a different method called &quot;scouting&quot;, which the site describes as &quot;a way to vet users and weed out spam, stolen works, low quality submissions, etc.&quot; All users can put art and audio onto their own page, but only those that are &quot;scouted&quot; will appear in the public area. Like the judgment system, it stops stolen content, spam, or prohibited material reaching the public area, relying on users and site moderators. Once an individual is scouted, they are given the privilege to scout others, though users caught scouting other users who regularly break the site&#x27;s terms of service and/or guidelines (&quot;abusing the system&quot;) get unscouted themselves.

Content and context are liable to be reported for review to the moderators and staff members by flagging it for violations to the site&#x27;s guidelines. A weighted system recognizes experienced users and gives their flag more voice. Newgrounds&#x27; homepage includes featured submissions from each category, as well as awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site&#x27;s requirements to earn them. Members of Newgrounds also organize animations called &quot;collabs&quot; through the discussion forum on the site. Some scholars noted that while hundreds of these &quot;collabs&quot; are produced every year, only 20% are completed due to stress on those making the animations, while other scholars said that animators maintain a &quot;strong sense&quot; of authorship and ownership of what they produce, especially solo animators.

Although the site hosted animations about Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and the Taliban, with right-wing views seeming to reflect a &quot;sizable part&quot; of the site&#x27;s user base in the early 2000&#x27;s, some scholars argued that the site has had a &quot;relatively balanced&quot; conversation on politics throughout the sites growth.

==History==

In 1991, at the age of 13, Tom Fulp launched a Neo Geo fanzine called &quot;New Ground&quot; and sent issues to approximately 100 members of a club originating on the online service Prodigy. Using a hosting service, he launched a website called &quot;New Ground Remix&quot; in 1995, which increased in popularity during the summer of 1996 after Fulp created the BBS games &quot;Club a Seal&quot; and &quot;Assassin&quot; while a student at Drexel University. He then created &quot;Club a Seal II&quot; and &quot;Assassin II&quot;, along with a separate hosting site titled &quot;New Ground Atomix&quot;. The 1999 release of &quot;Pico&#x27;s School&quot;, a Flash browser game that &quot;exhibited a complexity of design and polish in presentation that was virtually unseen in amateur Flash game development&quot; of the time helped establish Newgrounds as a &quot;public force.&quot;

1999 also saw the consolidation of both sites into one domain name (newgrounds.com), and the creation of &quot;The Portal&quot;, a place on the site for Fulp to put his Flash projects that were smaller and more unfinished. Site visitors began to reach out through email with their own Flash content, which was showcased on a webpage in The Portal. By 2000, there were so many Portal submissions that submitting Flash content to the Portal would become an automated process with the help of Fulp&#x27;s friend Ross. Tom has stated that the automated Portal &quot;ultimately defined [Newgrounds]&#x27;s purpose&quot;.

While Macromedia Flash Player was required for Newgrounds in order to play games, the site also brought together members who were interested in producing Flash games and gained &quot;considerable online influence&quot; as a result. It subsequently became one of the most &quot;active Flash creator communities in the English-speaking Internet&quot; and served as a place that video game developers could begin their careers. Flash was once described by Newgrounds as the &quot;driving force&quot; behind the site. Even so, those on the site had a &quot;low tolerance for poor quality work&quot;, referring mainly to humor and storytelling instead of animation quality. Some animators on the site moved to YouTube by the mid-2000s.

By November 2008, Newgrounds had over 1.5 million users and over 130,000 animations. This had increased by August 2010, when it was reported that the site had over 2.2 million users and over 180,000 games and animated films, most of which were animations made by only one person, with others collaboratively made by various individuals. It was also said in 2013 that users had created &quot;hundreds of thousands of animated movies and online games&quot;.

&quot;Time&quot; ranked the website at No. 39 on its list of &quot;50 Best Websites&quot; in 2010.

In 2018, Newgrounds began to encourage contributors to submit their games in an HTML5 format rather than Flash. In November and December, it experienced surges of new members originally from Tumblr when that site began restricting adult content after illegal child pornography was found on it, resulting in the Tumblr iOS app being removed from the App Store.

In the summer of 2019, with the discontinuation of Flash upcoming, the administration of Newgrounds unveiled the &quot;Newgrounds Player&quot; for Windows, which was described as a &quot;solution for playing Flash games and movies&quot; hosted on the site. The application would launch via the website upon a request to view Flash content and play it. The player would later be followed up with the Ruffle Flash emulator in August 2019, with the two options being offered in tandem as development on Ruffle progressed.

In April 2021, an update for the browser game &quot;Friday Night Funkin&#x27;&quot; was exclusively released on Newgrounds at the time, causing the site&#x27;s server to become overloaded after an influx of site traffic.

In July 2021, Fulp received the Game Developers Choice Awards Pioneer Award for his contributions to establishing Newgrounds and subsequent work in The Behemoth.

In September 2023, an update to the site&#x27;s Art Portal was rolled out, implementing it in the existing Project system for animation, games and audio, as well as adding the ability to use multi-author credits on Art submissions and adding multi-art support in either Inline, Strip or Gallery formats.

In March 2024, the site&#x27;s reporting system was updated to enable users to report content predominantly generated by artificial intelligence (AI).

<text>The Tupolev Tu-72 was a proposed Soviet medium bomber of the late 1940s. It was based on the Tupolev Tu-8, but differed by having a slightly longer fuselage, increased defensive armament, and slightly enlarged vertical stabilizers. The first flight of the Tu-72 was scheduled for 1948, but the project was cancelled due to the success of the Tupolev Tu-4 and Tupolev&#x27;s focus on first-generation strategic jet bombers.

<doc id="563708" wikidata="Q1550587" url="?curid=563708" title="Tupolev Tu-70">
<text>The Tupolev Tu-70 (; NATO reporting name: Cart) was a Soviet passenger variant of the Tu-4 bomber, an unlicensed, reverse engineered copy of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Designed immediately after the end of World War II, it used a number of components from Boeing B-29s that had made emergency landings in the Soviet Union after bombing Japan. It had the first pressurized fuselage in the Soviet Union and first flew on 27 November 1946. The aircraft was successfully tested, recommended for serial production, but ultimately not produced because of more pressing military orders and because Aeroflot had no requirement for such an aircraft. A military cargo aircraft version was the Tupolev Tu-75.

==Design and development==
After basic design work was completed on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided to design a passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. Design work on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, as it was to be known, would be made after testing.

To speed up construction of the prototype, a number of components were utilized from two B-29s. These included the outer wing panels, the engine cowlings, the flaps, the undercarriage, the tail assembly and some of the internal equipment. The wing center section was redesigned and its span increased. The pressurized fuselage was entirely new and changed the wing&#x27;s position from mid-wing to low-wing. The aircraft&#x27;s cockpit windscreen was changed to a more conventional &quot;stepped&quot; configuration. Three different configurations were proposed for the cabin layout, a government VIP version, a mixed-class 40–48 passenger model and an airliner configuration with 72 seats. The prototype appears to have been built in the mixed-class configuration, but that cannot be confirmed.

The Tu-70 was completed in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer&#x27;s trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem and fixing it prolonged the manufacturer&#x27;s trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement for the type, being fully satisfied with its existing Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.

It was sent to the NII VVS ( – Scientific-Research Institute of the Air Forces) for evaluation as a military transport aircraft in December 1951. It was used afterwards for a variety of tests before being scrapped in 1954. Its design was modified to a military transport as the Tupolev Tu-75, but this was also not placed into production.

<text>&quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, originally titled &quot;In Other Words&quot;, is a song written in 1954 by Bart Howard. The first recording of the song was made in 1954 by Kaye Ballard. Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1964 version was closely associated with the Apollo missions to the Moon.

In 1999, the Songwriters Hall of Fame honored &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; by inducting it as a &quot;Towering Song&quot;.

==Background and composition==
In 1954, when &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; was first presented to the public, Bart Howard had been pursuing a career in music for over 20 years. He played piano to accompany cabaret singers, but also wrote songs with Cole Porter, his idol, in mind. In the book &quot;Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret&quot; James Gavin noted that Howard wrote the song &quot;in response to his publisher&#x27;s plea for a simpler song: why did he have to write such grandiloquent lyrics? &#x27;In Other Words&#x27; talked about the verbosity of poets who &#x27;use many words to say a simple thing&#x27;; &#x27;hold my hand,&#x27; &#x27;Kiss me.&#x27;&quot; 
In response, Howard wrote a cabaret ballad. A publisher tried to make him change some words from &quot;fly me to the Moon&quot; to &quot;take me to the Moon,&quot; but Howard refused. Many years later Howard commented that &quot;... it took me 20 years to find out how to write a song in 20 minutes.&quot;

He used his position as a piano accompanist and presenter at the Blue Angel cabaret venue to promote the song, and it was soon introduced in cabaret performances by Felicia Sanders.

The song was composed in time signature but was changed to by Quincy Jones in his arrangement.

==Early recordings==
Kaye Ballard made the song&#x27;s first commercial recording, released by Decca in April 1954. A brief review published on May 8, 1954, in &quot;Billboard&quot; said that &quot;In Other Words&quot; was &quot;...a love song sung with feeling by Miss Ballard.&quot; This recording was released as the flipside of &quot;Lazy Afternoon&quot;, which Kaye Ballard was currently performing as star of the stage show &quot;The Golden Apple&quot;.

Over the next few years, jazz and cabaret singers released cover versions of &quot;In Other Words&quot; on EP or LP record albums, including Chris Connor, Johnny Mathis, Portia Nelson, and Nancy Wilson. Eydie Gormé sang the song on her 1958 album &quot;Eydie In Love&quot; (under the title &quot;In Other Words&quot;), which reached No. 20 in the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Album Charts.

==Subsequent recordings and uses==
In 1960, Peggy Lee released the song on the album &quot;Pretty Eyes&quot;, then made it more popular when she performed it in front of a large television audience on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. As the song&#x27;s popularity increased, it became better known as &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, and in 1963 Peggy Lee convinced Bart Howard to make the name change official. Connie Francis released two non-English versions of the song in 1963: in Italian as &quot; and in Spanish as &quot;.

In 1962, Joe Harnell arranged and recorded an instrumental version in a bossa nova style. It was released as a single in late 1962. Harnell&#x27;s version spent 13 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, reaching No. 14 on February 23, 1963, while reaching No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Middle-Road Singles chart. It reached No. 30 in Canada. Harnell&#x27;s version was ranked No. 89 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s end of year ranking &quot;Top Records of 1963&quot;. Harnell&#x27;s recording won him a Grammy Award at the 5th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Performance by an Orchestra – for Dancing. His version was included on his album &quot;Fly Me to the Moon and the Bossa Nova Pops&quot; released in early 1963, which reached No. 3 stereo album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LP&#x27;s chart.

Julie London included a cover of the song for her 1963 album &quot;The End of the World&quot;. Paul Anka released a version of &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot; in 1963, appearing in his album &quot;Our Man Around the World&quot;.

Frank Sinatra included the song on his 1964 album &quot;It Might as Well Be Swing&quot;, accompanied by Count Basie. The music for this album was arranged by Quincy Jones, who had worked with Count Basie a year earlier on the album &quot;This Time by Basie&quot;, which also included a version of &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;. Will Friedwald commented that &quot;Jones boosted the tempo and put it into an even four/four&quot; for Basie&#x27;s version, but &quot;when Sinatra decided to address it with the Basie/Jones combination they recharged it into a straight swinger... [which]...all but explodes with energy&quot;. Bart Howard estimated that by the time Frank Sinatra covered the song in 1964, more than 100 other versions had been recorded.

Bobby Womack recorded a version that was released in 1968 on Minit Records, from his album &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;. His rendition reached No. 52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 16 on the R&amp;B chart. Occasionally on the CBS series &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, an instrumental sampling of &quot;Fly Me To The Moon&quot; was used as a doorbell melody during scenes taking place in the apartment of character Jennifer Marlowe.

Bengali-Pakistani pop singer Alamgir recorded the Urdu version of this song titled Kya Tum Mere Ho (are you mine). The song was released in 1981 for his album Alamgir Sings for Himself.

By 1995, the song had been recorded more than 300 times. According to a poll conducted by Japanese music magazine &quot;CD&amp;DL Data&quot; in 2016 about the most representative songs associated with the Moon, the cover versions by Claire Littley and Yoko Takahashi ranked 7th by 6,203 respondents. The Claire cover version won the Planning Award of Heisei Anisong Grand Prize among the anime theme songs from 1989 to 1999, following its appearance in the end credits of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;.

Richard Simmons&#x27;s last words were a loose paraphrase of the song&#x27;s lyrics.

During the 67th Annual Grammy Awards on February 2, 2025, Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock performed a cover of the song as a tribute to Quincy Jones.

==NASA association==
Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1964 recording of &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; became closely associated with NASA&#x27;s Apollo space program. A copy of the song was played on a Sony TC-50 portable cassette player on the Apollo 10 mission which orbited the Moon, and also on Apollo 11 before the first landing on the Moon. The song&#x27;s association with Apollo 11 was reprised many years later when Diana Krall sang it at the mission&#x27;s 40th anniversary commemoration ceremony, and also for mission commander Neil Armstrong&#x27;s memorial service in 2012.

<text>The Visigothic Code (, or Book of the Judgements; ), also called Lex Visigothorum (English: &quot;Law of the Visigoths&quot;), is a set of laws first promulgated by king Chindasuinth (642–653 AD) of the Visigothic Kingdom in his second year of rule (642–643) that survives only in fragments. In 654 his son, king Recceswinth (649–672), published the enlarged law code, which was the first law code that applied equally to the conquering Goths and the general population, of which the majority had Roman roots, and had lived under Roman laws.

The code abolished the old tradition of having different laws for Romans (&quot;leges romanae&quot;) and Visigoths (&quot;leges barbarorum&quot;), and under it all the subjects of the Visigothic kingdom would stop being &quot;romani&quot; and &quot;gothi&quot; instead becoming &quot;hispani&quot;. In this way, all subjects of the kingdom were gathered under the same jurisdiction, eliminating social and legal differences, and allowing greater assimilation of the populations. As such, the &quot;Code&quot; marks the transition from the Roman law to Germanic law and is one of the best surviving examples of &quot;leges barbarorum&quot;. It combines elements of the Roman law, Catholic law and Germanic tribal customary law.

==The first law codes==
During the first centuries of Visigothic rule, Romans were ruled by different laws than Goths were. The earliest known Visigothic laws are the &quot;Code of Euric&quot;, which were compiled by roughly 480 A.D. The first written laws of the Visigothic kingdom were compiled during the rule of king Alaric II and were meant to regulate the lives of Romans, who made up the majority of the kingdom and were based on the existing Roman imperial laws and their interpretations. The &quot;Breviarium&quot; (&quot;Breviary of Alaric&quot;) was promulgated during the meeting of Visigothic nobles in Toulouse on February 2, 506.

During the reign of King Leovigild an attempt was made to unite the laws regulating the lives of Goths and those who had previously been Roman subjects, into a revised law code, &quot;Codex Revisus&quot;. In 589, at the Third Council of Toledo, the ruling Visigoths and Suebi, who had long practiced Arianism, converted to Latin Catholicism. Now that the formerly Roman population and the Goths shared the same faith, King Reccared issued laws that equally applied to both populations.

==Visigothic code==

The code of 654 was enlarged by the novel legislation of Recceswinth (for which reason it is sometimes called the &quot;Code of Recceswinth&quot;) and later kings Wamba, Erwig, Egica, and perhaps Wittiza. Recceswinth&#x27;s code was edited by Braulio of Zaragoza, since Chindasuinth&#x27;s original code had been hastily written and promulgated.

During the Twelfth Council of Toledo in 681, King Erwig asked that the law code be clarified and revised. Some new laws were added, out of which 28 dealt with Jews.

The laws were far-reaching and long in effect: in 10th-century Galicia, monastic charters make reference to the &quot;Code&quot;. The laws govern and sanction family life and by extension political life: marriage, the transmission of property to heirs, safeguarding the rights of widows and orphans. Particularly with the Visigoth&#x27;s Law Codes, women could inherit land and title, were allowed to manage land independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20.

The laws combined the Catholic Church&#x27;s Canon law, and as such have a strongly theocratic tone.

The code is known to have been preserved by the Moors, as Christians were permitted the use of their own laws, where they did not conflict with those of the conquerors, upon the regular payment of jizya tribute. Thus it may be presumed that it was the recognized legal authority of Christian magistrates while the Iberian Peninsula remained under Muslim control. When Ferdinand III of Castile took Córdoba in the thirteenth century, he ordered that the code be adopted and observed by his subjects, and had it translated, albeit inaccurately, into the Spanish language, as the &quot;Fuero Juzgo&quot;. The Occitan language translation of this document, &quot;Llibre Jutge&quot;, is among the oldest literary texts in that language (c. 1050). In 1910 an English translation of the code by Samuel Parsons Scott was published, but it received severe criticism.

<text>Amc Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (doing business as AMC Theatres, originally an abbreviation for American Multi-Cinema; often referred to simply as AMC) is an American movie theater chain founded in Kansas City, Missouri, and now headquartered in Leawood, Kansas. It is the largest movie theater chain in the world. Founded in 1920, AMC has the largest share of the U.S. theater market, ahead of Regal Cinemas and Cinemark Theatres. After acquiring Odeon Cinemas, UCI Cinemas, and Carmike Cinemas in 2016, it became the largest movie theater chain in the world. It has 2,807 screens in 353 European theaters and 7,755 screens in 593 American theaters.

The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange; from 2012 to 2018, the Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group owned a majority stake in the company. Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners made a $600 million investment in AMC in September 2018, but the voting power of AMC shares was structured so that Wanda Group still controlled the majority of AMC&#x27;s board of directors. Amid financial downturns caused by the COVID-19 lockdowns, in January 2021, Wanda&#x27;s ownership was increasingly diluted due to new financing by AMC, as well as short squeezes that resulted in Silver Lake converting its $600 million debt holding to equity. In early-February 2021, Wanda converted its Class B shares to Class A shares, thus reducing its voting power to less than 50%.

== History ==

AMC Theatres was founded in 1920 by Maurice, William, Irvin, Edward, and Barney Dubinsky, sons of Russian Jewish immigrants Simon and Sarah Dubinsky. The Dubinsky brothers had been traveling the Midwest performing melodramas and tent shows with actress Jeanne Eagels. They purchased the Regent Theatre on 12th Street between Walnut and Grand in downtown Kansas City, Missouri. Maurice, the oldest brother, died in 1929, and Barney left the company in 1936 after being injured in an auto accident. Edward, the youngest brother, eventually changed his last name to Durwood, and the company they formed eventually became known as Durwood Theatres, after a legal fight with his brothers. The chain also had theaters in St. Joseph and Jefferson City, Missouri and Leavenworth and Topeka, Kansas.

When Edward&#x27;s son Stanley left the U.S. Air Force after World War II, he joined the company in 1945. He persuaded his father to build drive-in theaters in St. Joseph, Jefferson City, and Leavenworth. In 1947 they expanded further with the acquisition of the Liberty Theater in downtown Kansas City which they remodeled and renamed the Roxy. They won an antitrust suit to enable them to show first-run product at the Roxy and went on to acquire all of the downtown cinemas in Kansas City including The Empire Theater, the Capri Theatre, the Midland Theatre and the Paramount Theatre.

In 1961, after Ed died, Stanley took control of Durwood Theatres, a small ten-theatre chain. With an interstate planned around Kansas City, Durwood looked to sites outside downtown and acquired two sites at a shopping center on Kansas City&#x27;s Ward Parkway to build a 700-seat theater. As the sites could not be combined, they opened two theaters side-by-side as the Parkway Twin Theatre in 1963. This was the company&#x27;s first foray into using the multiplex model. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, Stanley Durwood later claimed in 1962 that he &quot;was standing in the lobby of his 600-seat Roxy in Kansas City mulling over its poor grosses, when he realized he could double his box office by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff.&quot;

Following the success of the Parkway Twin, AMC followed up with the Embassy 3 triplex at the Country Club Plaza; the Metro Plaza, a four-screen theater in Kansas City in 1966; and a six-screen theater in Omaha in 1969.

The industry quickly embraced the multiplex concept, where additional screens meant very little difference in staff and operating costs but resulted in a significant profit increase. The concept also provided more film choices at one location, drawing bigger crowds. It also gave owners the flexibility to show big hits on more screens and less reliance on any individual film that could turn out to be a bust.

Stanley renamed Durwood Theatres as American Royal Cinema on October 1, 1968, after the American Royal livestock and horse show, but the latter&#x27;s producers sought an injunction, and the name was changed to American Multi-Cinema, Inc.

Stanley began to apply military management and the insights of management science to revolutionize the movie theatre industry. As he later explained to &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, &quot;We needed to define what our company was doing in the (exhibition) business. My dad wasn&#x27;t that organized.&quot; It was structured under the belief that every customer was a &quot;guest&quot;.

=== Growth ===

By the 1980s, the company was experiencing strong growth; in 1983, it had its initial public offering. AMC Theatres built its first multiplex overseas in 1985, the 10-screen multiplex at The Point, Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom, and later opened additional sites in the UK such as in Dudley and Tamworth, Staffordshire. In October 1988, they announced a joint venture with United Artists Theaters and Cinema International Corporation (a partnership of Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios) to run their combined cinemas in the UK, Ireland under the AMC name, however, AMC pulled out of the joint venture in December 1988, and sold their U.K. assets, including their 12 cinemas, to the new entity (later called United Cinemas International) for $98 million and withdrew from the UK market.

In 1988, Kinepolis Brussels, the first megaplex in the world, with 25 screens and 7,600 seats, was opened by Kinepolis, the European chain.&lt;ref name=&quot;globenewswire/1581542&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/europe-invasion-multiplex&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cinematreasures/11274&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, AMC Theatres opened the first North American megaplex, the AMC Grand 24 in Dallas, Texas, a theater complex that could accommodate thousands. AMC continued to open other megaplex theaters, such as the AMC Hampton Towne Center 24 in Hampton, Virginia, and the chain&#x27;s busiest theater in the US, the AMC Empire 25 in New York City near Times Square.

On December 13, 1996, AMC opened the Ontario Mills 30, a 30-screen theater in Ontario, California, which at the time was the largest multiplex in the world. AMC Theatres&#x27; megaplex theatres were a success overseas as well. In April 1996, they opened Canal City 13 in Fukuoka, Japan, which was followed on December 20, 1996, by the AMC Arrábida 20 in Porto, Portugal. In January 2002, the 16-screen Great Northern theatre was opened in Manchester in the U.K., marking the chain&#x27;s return to the UK market after 14 years. This was later supplemented by the opening of a 12-screen cinema on the Broadway Plaza site in Birmingham in October 2003. AMC Theatres sometimes serve a dual function; in addition to the regular cinema functions, they also cater to companies&#x27; business conferences that can make use of their projectors for displaying presentations.

In 2004, AMC Theatres was acquired by Marquee Holdings Inc., an investment vehicle controlled by affiliates of J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC, the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase, and Apollo Global Management, a private investment firm. At the time, AMC was publicly traded on AMEX under the code AEN.

In 2006, the company announced a new initial public offering (IPO) expected to be worth approximately $789 million; however, adverse market conditions convinced the company&#x27;s management to withdraw from such an offering on May 3, 2007. The company filed for a $450 million IPO in its third such filing since 2006 on July 14, 2010.

Stanley Durwood died in 1999, and his successor was Peter Brown, the first non-Dubinsky/Durwood family member to head the company. Gerardo I. Lopez succeeded Brown as president and CEO of AMC Theatres on March 2, 2009. Previously, Lopez was the Executive Vice President of President Consumer Products Group, Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee, and Foodservice at Starbucks. Under new leadership, one of the first major announcements came in March of the same year; the company announced that it would equip 1,500 of its screens with Real D projectors. In the same month, AMC Theatres announced it had closed on a $315 million deal with Sony to replace all of its reel projectors with digital cinema projectors, starting in the second quarter of 2009 and completing in 2012.

The company was formerly headquartered in downtown Kansas City. In September 2011, AMC Theatres announced plans to move its headquarters to a new $30 million four-story building designed by 360 Architecture in the Park Place development at 117th Street and Nall Avenue in Leawood, Kansas in suburban Kansas City. Kansas had offered $47 million in incentives to get the 400 jobs to move across the Kansas/Missouri border.

After reaching a settlement with the state of Illinois regarding complaints from a disability rights organization in April 2012, AMC pledged to equip all of its theaters in the state with captioning and description services by 2014. The disability rights group had accused the company of only providing closed captioning or audio description systems at some of its locations in the state.

=== Acquisition by Wanda Group (2012–2021) ===

In May 2012, AMC Theatres was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Wanda Group, headquartered in Dalian, who paid $2.6 billion to acquire AMC&#x27;s 5,048 screens in 347 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. The deal was finalized on September 4, 2012. The acquisition made Wanda the world&#x27;s largest cinema chain. Wang Jianlin, CEO of Dalian Wanda Group, announced that the company would plan to spend $500 million renovating AMC locations.

AMC Theatres had eight movie theatres in Canada. In July 2012, four locations were sold to Cineplex Entertainment, and two more locations were sold to Empire Theatres and later acquired by Landmark Cinemas. The two remaining locations have since closed.

Gerardo I. Lopez announced his resignation as CEO of AMC in August 2015. Craig Ramsey was appointed as the interim CEO by the company board. In December 2015, AMC announced that Adam Aron would be the company&#x27;s president and chief executive officer, as well as a member of the company&#x27;s board of directors, beginning on January 4, 2016.

In March 2016, AMC Theatres announced it would acquire competitor Carmike Cinemas. In July 2016, Carmike&#x27;s management accepted a revised offer, pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal was closed on December 25, 2016, making AMC the largest cinema chain in the United States.

On March 1, 2017, AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron stated that the company would rebrand Carmike Cinemas locations under the AMC name; smaller locations were rebranded under the new banner AMC Classic (which repurposes trademarks associated with Carmike). Aron also announced a plan to rebrand its kitchen-equipped theaters as AMC Dine-In.

In July 2017, AMC Theatres announced they would cut $30 million in expenses by the end of the year. This cost reduction would be accomplished by reducing operating hours, cutting staffing levels, and other measures.

In September 2018, Silver Lake Partners made a $600 million investment in AMC Theatres, whose proceeds were used to repurchase approximately 32% of Wanda Group&#x27;s class B common stock. However, the voting power of AMC&#x27;s shares is structured in such a way (granting three votes per-share for each Class B share if its stake in the company is above 30%) that, even after reducing its ownership of AMC common stock to just under 50% by the end of 2019, Wanda Group continued to retain majority control over AMC&#x27;s board of directors.

In October 2019, AMC began to offer on-demand rentals and purchases of digital film releases under the banner AMC Theatres On Demand. The service is tied to the company&#x27;s Stubs loyalty program.

=== Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ===
On March 18, 2020, AMC announced the closure of all of its theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in compliance with CDC guidance against any gathering of over ten people. AMC said this shutdown would last for at least six to twelve weeks. On March 25, 2020, AMC furloughed all of its 600 corporate employees, including CEO Adam Aron. All furloughed corporate AMC employees and associates retained active employment status, including all health benefits.

On April 28, 2020, AMC announced they would no longer carry films from Universal Pictures after NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell commented in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the studio wanted to release films via premium video-on-demand simultaneously with theatrical releases. The company threatened that this will also be done with any other studio &quot;who unilaterally abandons current windowing practices absent good faith negotiations between us, so that they as distributor and we as exhibitor both benefit and neither are hurt from such changes.&quot;

On June 3, 2020, AMC stated that it had &quot;substantial doubt&quot; that it would remain in business. On July 28, 2020, AMC and Universal were able to resolve their dispute, with AMC agreeing to a shorter theatrical window of 17 days before Universal could release their films via premium VOD, as well as revenue sharing on the premium VOD window.

On August 20, 2020, AMC began the process of reopening selected locations in the United States where allowed under local health orders. In honor of the company&#x27;s centennial year, AMC also offered a special 15-cent ticket promotion that day, promoted as &quot;Movies in 2020 at 1920 Prices.&quot; The company aimed for at least two thirds of its locations to be open in time for the September 3 release of &quot;Tenet&quot;. The company upgraded its air filtration systems to four times the rates before the pandemic and installed electrostatic sprayers in the auditoriums. In October 2020, the company reported that its existing cash resources &quot;would be largely depleted by the end of 2020 or early 2021.&quot;

=== Stock surge, end of Wanda Group control ===
On January 26, 2021, AMC stated that it had raised $917 million in new funding, including $506 million in equity and new common shares, and commitments for $411 million in debt financing. The company stated that this new funding &quot;should allow the company to make it through this dark coronavirus-impacted winter&quot;. The next day, as part of a wider series of short squeezes coordinated by the Reddit community r/wallstreetbets (which primarily targeted video game retailer GameStop), AMC experienced a major, 300% surge in its share price to a peak of $20.36. The surge triggered Silver Lake Partners&#x27; convertible bonds; on January 28, it reached an agreement to convert $600 million of its debt holdings in AMC to equity at $13.51 per-share. Mudrick Capital Management made nearly $200 million in profit off its holdings of AMC debt.

On February 5, 2021, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Wanda Group issued a filing with the SEC, stating that it had converted its Class B common stock to Class A shares to permit their sale. While Wanda remained AMC&#x27;s largest single shareholder, the conversion, as well as AMC&#x27;s financing efforts taking its stake below 37%, effectively surrendered its majority control since Class A stock only provides one vote per-share. On May 21, 2021, Wanda filed a 0.002% stake with the SEC, largely confirming the end of their involvement in AMC.

During its fourth-quarter earnings call in March 2021, the company reported that its revenue had fallen by 88% year-over-year. CEO Adam Aron stated that AMC was facing the &quot;most challenging market conditions in the 100-year history of the company&quot;, but cited progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, decisions to allow cinemas in New York City and Los Angeles to re-open, and a &quot;significant&quot; number of upcoming blockbuster films as signs of optimism. Aron also confirmed that Wanda no longer had majority control, and the company would now &quot;be governed like most other publicly traded companies with a wide array of shareholders&quot;.

In June 2021, retail investors once again poured into AMC stock, propelling shares to an all-time high of $77.26 in another alleged short squeeze. Short sellers betting against AMC incurred losses of over $2.8B as a result. AMC issued more shares during the surge, but warned potential investors against buying the shares &quot;unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment&quot;. The cinema chain operator said it believed current prices reflected &quot;market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business&quot;.
In the year to date, shares in AMC had soared 2,421% – despite its cinemas being largely shut during the pandemic.

In August 2021, the company revealed plans to begin accepting cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for purchases in the future, which it did in November 2021 for online purchases via PayPal. In April 2022, AMC added integration with BitPay as a payment provider to its mobile app, allowing customers to use crypto payments such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

On August 4, 2022, AMC took Wall Street by surprise with the announcement of its &quot;AMC Preferred Equity Units&quot; after market close, a new preferred share class. The units were to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;APE,&quot; a nod to the individual investors who turned the company into a meme stock, who often refer to themselves as &quot;apes&quot;. Over 516 million APE units were subsequently issued to AMC shareholders in a 1:1 special dividend, with the units wielding similar economic properties as common shares. AMC stock gained 19% to $22.18 at the close on Friday after initially falling following the announcement of the new units on Thursday. The preferred shares started trading under the &quot;APE&quot; ticker on the New York Stock Exchange starting Aug. 22. AMC CEO Adam Aron stated &quot;We are making great strides on our path towards pandemic recovery&quot;.

In February 2023 AMC announced plans to test a dynamic pricing model for tickets for showings that occur after 4pm based on seat location. Seats located near the front of the theatre and select ADA seats will be priced less than other seats and will only be made available to members of the Stubs rewards program and seats in the middle of the theatre will be priced more than the other non-front row seats. In addition, AMC Stubs A-List members will be able to reserve the expensive middle seats at no additional charge. In July 2023 AMC chose to abandon dynamic pricing after testing showed that customers were still not likely to choose front-row seats despite their lower prices, with most customers still sitting in the middle of the theatre or other non-front seats despite the upcharge. This made AMC believe that this made their prices less competitive as competitors did not also adapt dynamic pricing. The company also stated that it would test seats that recline further back in the front rows that would potentially allow better views.

On July 31, the company reported their highest single-week admissions revenue in company history due to the Barbenheimer craze. On September 6, AMC announced that it had planned to sell up 40 million shares.

==Features==

AMC patented cup holder armrests in 1981. AMC also introduced stadium-style seating. The seats are placed on risers so that each person has an unobstructed view of the screen. In 1995, they introduced &quot;Love Seat&quot; style seating with retractable armrests so that there can be no barrier between two seats. 
In July 1994, AMC signed an agreement with Sony to begin installing SDDS (Sony Dynamic Digital Sound) in auditoriums, and began upgrading selected older auditoriums in 2003. On March 26, 2009, AMC announced an agreement to convert 1,500 existing auditoriums to fully digital 3D screens using RealD technology.

On March 30, 2009, they announced they would convert all 4,500 screens in their chain to 4K digital projectors provided by Sony. In April 2022, AMC also announced an agreement with Cinionic to install laser projectors at 3,500 of its screens in the United States through the end of 2026.

===Premium formats===
Selected AMC locations offer premium screens and features for a higher ticket price, including premium large formats.

*Dolby Cinema is a premium auditorium that features dual 4K laser projectors with Dolby Vision HDR, Dolby Atmos surround sound, and recliners with seat-mounted subwoofers. They also feature special entrance tunnels into the auditorium, with a video wall displaying content relating to the film being screened. Some Dolby Cinema screens were converted from the Prime and ETX formats.
*IMAX auditoriums are available at many locations; IMAX digital or laser projectors are used in most locations, with a few using traditional 70 mm film projectors.
* Prime at AMC is a premium large format that features large screens with Dolby Atmos or DTS:X, and recliners with seat-mounted subwoofers. In 2015, AMC began to replace Prime with Dolby Cinema at some locations. 
*BigD is a premium large format inherited from the Carmike Cinemas chain, which uses a 70-foot screen and stadium seating with retractable armrests.
*RealD 3D auditoriums are available, using RealD glasses.

====Defunct premium format====
* ETX (Enhanced Theatre Experience) was a premium large format used in selected markets, which included larger screens, 12-channel surround sound, and digital projection (utilizing either Sony 4K projection or Christie DLP technology). Some auditoriums also included Dolby Atmos. In 2015, AMC began to replace ETX with Dolby Cinema.

===Virtual reality===
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. invested $20 million in virtual-reality arcades and productions: $10 million to virtual reality entertainment company Dreamscape Immersive and another $10 million in a content fund.

===Guest loyalty programs===
AMC Theatres created the now-defunct MovieWatcher program that rewarded frequent movie-goers similar to other rewards programs but featured innovative aspects. It was based on a points-per-movie-ticket-purchased system, with rewards varying from concessions to movie passes based on point-based level. However, points were limited to a maximum of four points per three-hour time period, which was equal to two tickets. For the AMC cinemas that were not part of the Loews Cineplex acquisition and therefore ticketed by MovieTickets.com, the website&#x27;s surcharge was waived for MovieWatcher members.

On April 1, 2011, AMC started a new rewards program known as AMC Stubs, which could be purchased for a fee of $12 for an entire year. For that initial fee, members would receive $5 on every $50 spent between the box office and the concession stand at any AMC theater nationwide. AMC Stubs members also received a free size upgrade with every popcorn and drink they purchase (for example, an AMC Stubs member can get a large popcorn for the price of a regular).

Other perks include birthday gifts and waived ticketing fees for online ticketing sites such as MovieTickets.com and Fandango and also online ticket purchases through AMC&#x27;s own website and mobile app. Receipts or ticket stubs were required for manual adjustments. No more than four manual adjustments would be allowed per account in a single calendar month. Manual adjustments would be made for purchases made within 30 calendar days from date of original purchase.

As of March 29, 2012, AMC Stubs had 3.2 million members, which represents approximately 18% of AMC attendance during fiscal 2012. In July 2018, AMC Stubs was split into three programs that are currently still in-place: the free AMC Stubs Insider; the yearly fee-based AMC Stubs Premiere, which costs $15 annually and provides the same benefits as the original Stubs plus an expedited line at tickets and concessions; and the monthly fee-based AMC Stubs A-List, which includes up to 3 movie tickets a week to any film in any format for $19.95 to $23.95 a month, depending on the state the member plans to watch movies in. Discount Tuesdays is another feature every Tuesday for members to purchase tickets typically for just $6 to any film in most locations, with occasional exclusions, plus surcharges for premium formats such as 3D, IMAX, and Dolby Cinema, as well as special events.

===MacGuffins Bar and Lounge===
Some AMC locations have a bar service under the MacGuffins brand. These are primarily offered at AMC and AMC Dine-in locations, but some AMC Classic locations with liquor licenses offer their alcoholic beverages under this brand. Drinks can be ordered to be consumed in the bar and lounge area or taken into the theater. Some AMC Dine-in theaters have their MacGuffins set up as a full-service restaurant that can be accessed without having to pay for a movie ticket.

===Vouchers===
Several types of vouchers may be used at AMC Theatres.

* Black And Yellow tickets
** AMC sells Black and Yellow (formerly Red, Green, Gold, and Silver) tickets, typically priced from $8.50 to $10.25, that can be purchased in bulk at many retailers, like Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club, as well as at AMC locations. Both can be redeemed towards any movie, but yellow tickets cannot be redeemed in the states of California, New York, and New Jersey. Regardless of the ticket used, surcharges apply for special presentations and premium formats such as RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX, among others.
* Gift cards
** AMC offers gift cards, which are sold at AMC theaters and by some retailers. They can be used to buy goods or services (such as tickets and food) both online and at AMC theaters.
* Snack vouchers
** AMC offers Show Snacks coupons. Some can be exchanged for a small popcorn, while others offer a small fountain drink. The chain also offers similar coupons via SMS or smartphone apps. Older coupons specially designed for the concession stand may be honored by AMC, at its discretion.

==Banners==
Following the acquisition of Carmike Cinemas, AMC began to unify its cinemas under one of three main banners in 2017:

* AMC serves as the flagship banner, covering conventional cinemas with premium features and formats available. Many of the former Loews Cineplex Entertainment theatres still use the Magic Johnson Theatres sub-brand as AMC Magic Johnson and, formerly until 2017, AMC Loews.
*AMC Classic is used for smaller locations with fewer premium amenities. The brand is primarily used by the former Carmike locations, and use Carmike&#x27;s &quot;folded film&quot; logo and &quot;America&#x27;s Hometown Cinemas&quot; slogan. Since the Carmike purchase, some AMC Classic locations have undergone refurbishments to add expanded concessions options (including a larger menu, MacGuffins bars, and Coca-Cola Freestyle machines), upgraded AV equipment, and reclining seats, and switches from second-run to first-run films.
* AMC Dine-In is used for cinemas that offer expanded food service, including auditoriums with reserved seating and table service. Very similar to Studio Movie Grill.

==Other endeavors==
AMC also formed a short-lived partnership with Planet Hollywood that failed due to that company&#x27;s bankruptcy. The Planet Movies by AMC venture planned to open complexes worldwide with the objective of having icon locations in major metropolitan and other select areas, like Orlando and Columbus. Initially, seven existing, unnamed AMC megaplex theaters with more than 150 combined screens were to be re-branded under a license arrangement to incorporate certain elements of the new concept. The initial seven re-branded locations were to include markets such as Orlando, Florida. The AMC Pleasure Island 24 megaplex in Orlando, situated directly across from Planet Hollywood&#x27;s most successful restaurant and retail unit and adjacent to Disney&#x27;s Pleasure Island (now Disney Springs) was to be the first Planet Movies location.

After the initial seven, the joint-venture planned to own and operate all subsequent units including 8 to 10 complexes with 200 to 250 screens planned to open over the next 18 to 24 months. Over the longer term, the venture anticipated rolling out units at the rate of 5 to 10 per year. From almost the very start, the well-publicized financial strains on Planet Hollywood hindered the project. The only Planet Movies location to actually open, a 30 screen megaplex, did so in the summer of 1999 at Easton Town Center in Columbus, Ohio. The location was also located alongside an Official All Star Café and Planet Hollywood restaurant.

The continued poor financial performance of Planet Hollywood led the company to declare bankruptcy in December 1998, and even before the first location had opened stated that &quot;the joint venture has no definitive plans to expand this concept once the Columbus site is completed&quot;. As Planet Hollywood was preparing to emerge from bankruptcy in October 1999 their re-organization plan emphasized focus back on their core restaurant business and away from side-ventures like Planet Movies and their Cool Planet ice cream chain. The Planet Hollywood restaurant and All Star Café in Columbus were closed in late 2000, and the film memorabilia were also removed from the theater as it was rebranded AMC Easton 30, and continues to operate. The Planet Movies by AMC joint venture was formally dissolved on January 9, 2001.

Both of the Disney Parks in the United States at one time included AMC movie theaters at their Downtown Disney sections: AMC Dine-In Disney Springs 24 all-stadium-seating megaplex with Dolby Cinema and Dine-In Theatres (opened in 1996) (formerly AMC Pleasure Island 24) at Walt Disney World Resort and AMC Downtown Disney 12 at Disneyland Resort stadium-seating multiplex (opened in 2001, closed in 2018). The AMC CityWalk Stadium 19 located on Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s CityWalk was relaunched after a renovation as &quot;Universal Cinema, an AMC Theatre&quot;, on April 21, 2017. This location includes a seven-story IMAX screen with IMAX Laser and IMAX 70mm film, as well as &quot;Black Box&quot;–inspired auditoriums. It has one Christie Laser Projector per auditorium, with Dolby Atmos speakers. At Universal Orlando Resort, AMC had the Universal Cineplex 20 (also a former Cineplex Odeon), until September 2018 when it became a Cinemark.

AMC Independent (also known as AMCi) is an AMC film distribution program that aims to help independent films reach a theatrical audience. The program was announced in 2010 via the AMC Blog, and has been responsible for promoting and distributing all independent films to AMC theaters since.

In July 2021, AMC Theatres partnered with American artist Chance the Rapper and his content production company House of Kicks in a trailblazing international distribution agreement to bring his concert film &quot;Magnificent Coloring World&quot; to cinemas internationally, marking the first time an individual recording artist distributed a film through AMC. This deal was revisited in 2023 when AMC partnered with Taylor Swift and Beyoncé to release their respective concert films &quot;Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour&quot; and &quot;&quot;. In all three cases, AMC acted as both the distributor and exhibitor of the films, bypassing the involvement of major film studios.

In January 2022, AMC Theatres started selling popcorn via food delivery, before entering supermarkets, in order to compensate for the COVID-19 pandemic-induced downturn in movie theaters.

In March 2022, AMC Theatres acquired a 22% share in Hycroft Mining, a gold and silver mining company in Nevada, which had also been experiencing a major liquidity crisis in the prior year.

==Acquisitions==
AMC has acquired multiple other theater chains throughout its history, resulting in a total of 385 theaters with 5,128 screens in six countries:

In March 2002, AMC bought General Cinema Corporation, which added 66 theaters with 621 screens to the company assets, as well as Gulf States Theaters, which had five theaters with 68 screens in the greater New Orleans area. In late 2003, AMC acquired MegaStar Theatres, adding additional theaters in the Atlanta and Minneapolis–St. Paul markets.

On January 26, 2006, AMC merged with Loews Cineplex Entertainment to form AMC Entertainment; the deal brought into AMC&#x27;s fold the entire Loews and American Cineplex chains, along with Magic Johnson Theatres (named after NBA player Magic Johnson) and Star Theatres, based in Metro Detroit. In 2010, AMC acquired Chicago-based Kerasotes Showplace Theatres, LLC for $275 million, combining the nation&#x27;s second and sixth largest movie theater chains, except for the Showplace 14 in New Jersey and the Showplace ICON theatres.

In December 2015, Starplex Cinemas was sold to AMC for approximately $175 million. Most of these theaters now operate as AMC Classic as of July 2017.

On March 3, 2016, AMC announced its intent to acquire Carmike Cinemas in a $1.1 billion deal, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, which would allow it to overtake Regal as the United States&#x27; largest movie theater chain. The merger officially closed in December 2016.

In July 2016, UCI &amp; Odeon Cinema Group was sold to AMC for approximately $1.21 billion, subject to European Commission approval. The acquisition was approved by the European Commission and the deal closed in November 2016.

In January 2017, Nordic Cinema Group, the leading movie theater operator in the Nordic and Baltic area, was sold to AMC for approximately $929 million. The deal was completed in March 2017 after AMC received clearance from the European Commission.

In July 2021, AMC Theatres announced that it would acquire the leases to the Americana at Brand in downtown Glendale and The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles locations, formerly owned by Pacific Theatres, and that they would reopen in August as part of the AMC chain. The company has not ruled out acquiring the leases of other Pacific Theatres locations. In December 2021, AMC Theaters also announced that they had acquired the leases to the former Pacific Theaters location at Northridge Fashion Center in Northridge, Los Angeles and the Arclight Chicago 14 in Lincoln Park, Chicago, which both opened in 2022. In February 2022, AMC Theaters reached a deal to acquire the leases to the Arclight Montgomery 16 at Westfield Montgomery in Washington D.C. and the Westfield UTC mall&#x27;s Arclight UTC 14 in La Jolla, with the former reopening that month and the latter in March of that year. During the same month, the company reached an agreement to acquire the lease to the Century 12 Evanston, previously owned by Cinemark Theatres, in Evanston, Illinois. In December 2022, the company reached a deal on the acquisition of the former Arclight Cinemas located at The Hub on Causeway in Boston.

In April 2022, AMC Theaters acquired seven Bow Tie Cinemas locations in Connecticut, New York, and Maryland.

==Controversies==
The early versions of stadium-style seating as built by AMC in 1995 had auditoriums configured with an entrance to a flat area immediately in front of the screen for wheelchair users. People seated there had to either lean back or look up at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen. Able-bodied guests had to ascend the stairs to sit in the middle of the risers in order to have a comfortable line-of-sight with the screen. Since some wheelchair users have limited neck movement range, this configuration made AMC a popular target for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) lawsuits. AMC subsequently solved the problem in newer theaters by building full-stadium auditoriums where the main entrance is through a ramp that emerges onto a platform in the middle of the risers so that wheelchair users can enjoy optimal line-of-sight. However, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the company, and obtained an order requiring AMC to retrofit over 1,990 screens in 95 multiplexes and megaplexes across the United States.
The company successfully appealed the order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled on December 5, 2008 that the order was excessive and violated AMC&#x27;s due process rights under the Constitution of the United States. AMC won by pointing out that the United States Access Board had not yet amended its guidelines for movie theaters to specifically require them to provide wheelchair guests sightlines that were as good as those from elevated risers, versus merely providing an unobstructed view of the screen. Therefore, the court ruled that it was unfair to AMC to retroactively hold it to a standard that did not exist at the time it began building stadium-style theaters.

When AMC announced that most of their theaters would reopen in mid-July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial announcement said masks would be recommended but not mandatory. AMC CEO Adam Aron stated, &quot;We are strongly encouraging our guests to wear masks all across the country, but not requiring it&quot; and &quot;We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy... We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary.&quot; After massive pushback from the public, Aron changed the policy to require masks: &quot;This announcement prompted an intense and immediate outcry from our customers, and it is clear from this response that we did not go far enough on the usage of masks,&quot; Aron said.

<text>Jack Handey (born February 25, 1949) is an American humorist. He is best known for his &quot;Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey&quot;, a large body of surrealistic one-liner jokes, as well as his &quot;Fuzzy Memories&quot; and &quot;My Big Thick Novel&quot; shorts, and for his deadpan delivery. Although many assume otherwise, Handey is a real person, not a pen name or character.

==Career==
Handey&#x27;s earliest writing job was for a newspaper, the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;. He lost the job after writing an article that, in his words, &quot;offended local car dealerships&quot;. His first comic writing was with comedian Steve Martin. According to Martin, Handey got a job writing for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL) after Martin introduced him to the show&#x27;s creator, Lorne Michaels. For several years, Handey worked on other television projects: the Canadian sketch series &quot;Bizarre&quot; in 1980, the 1980 Steve Martin television special &quot;Comedy Is Not Pretty!&quot;, and Lorne Michaels&#x27;s short-lived sketch show on NBC called &quot;The New Show&quot; in 1984. Handey returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1985 as a writer.

===Deep Thoughts===
Handey&#x27;s &quot;deep thoughts&quot; were first published in an untitled essay in &quot;Omni&quot; magazine in November 1983. In April 1984, &quot;National Lampoon&quot; published a piece titled &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot;. Additional Deep Thoughts appeared in the October and November 1984 editions, as well as in the short-lived &quot;Army Man&quot; comedy magazine, while more appeared in 1988 in &quot;The Santa Fe New Mexican&quot; newspaper. The one-liners were to become Handey&#x27;s signature work, notable for their concise humor and outlandish hypothetical situations. For example:

*If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.
*The crows seemed to be calling his name, thought Caw.
Handey&#x27;s work next showed up in the Michael Nesmith-produced TV series &quot;Television Parts&quot; in the format which later became famous on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (though in &quot;Television Parts&quot;, Nesmith provided the narration). Some of these segments appeared in the compilation video of that program, &quot;Doctor Duck&#x27;s Super Secret All-Purpose Sauce&quot;.

Between 1989 and 1990, Deep Thoughts were shown during commercial breaks on The Comedy Channel with Handey&#x27;s narration.
Between 1991 and 1998, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; included Deep Thoughts on the show as an interstitial segment (between sketches). Introduced by Phil Hartman and read live by Handey (neither actually appeared on screen), the one-liners proved to be extremely popular. Hartman intoned &quot;And now, Deep Thoughts, by Jack Handey...&quot;, and peaceful easy listening music played while the screen showed soothing pastoral scenes, much like a New Age relaxation video. Handey then read the Deep Thought as the text to it scrolled across the screen. They became an enduring feature of &quot;SNL&quot;, which often had multiple Thoughts in each episode, and made Handey a well-known name.

===Other SNL work===
Other Handey creations that appeared on SNL include the Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer, &quot;Fuzzy Memories&quot; which depicted reenactments of a twisted childhood memory and aired in the late 1990s, and the short-lived &quot;My Big Thick Novel&quot;, which were spoken excerpts from a very long book in the style of &quot;Deep Thoughts&quot; and which aired during SNL&#x27;s 2001–03 seasons.

Handey is also credited with creating Toonces the Driving Cat, the cat who could drive a car, although not very well. The recurring skit originated in 1989 with Steve Martin and Victoria Jackson as the crash-prone kitten&#x27;s owners. In 1992 NBC aired a half-hour Toonces special. Handey, who lived with a real cat by the same name, once said he could not remember exactly how he dreamed up the premise. He said, &quot;It was just one of those free association ideas you write down and look at later and think, &#x27;Maybe.

===Further writing===
In early April 2008, Handey published his first collection of magazine humor pieces, &quot;What I&#x27;d Say to the Martians and Other Veiled Threats&quot;. Associated Press critic Jake Coyle wrote, &quot;With absurdist musings such as these, Handey has established himself as the strangest of birds: a famous comedian whose platform is not the stage or screen, but the page.&quot; Handey subsequently became a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Shouts and Murmurs section.

On July 16, 2013, Handey&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Stench of Honolulu&quot;, was released by publisher Grand Central.

==Personal life==
Handey was born in San Antonio, Texas, in 1949. He graduated from Eastwood High School in El Paso, Texas, where he was the editor of the school newspaper, &quot;Sabre&quot;.

Handey and his wife, Marta Chavez Handey, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Previously, the Handeys had lived in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

<doc id="563743" wikidata="Q5691664" url="?curid=563743" title="Hearing test">
<text>A hearing test provides an evaluation of the sensitivity of a person&#x27;s sense of hearing and is most often performed by an audiologist using an audiometer. An audiometer is used to determine a person&#x27;s hearing sensitivity at different frequencies. There are other hearing tests as well, e.g., Weber test and Rinne test.

==Ear examination==
Prior to the hearing test, the ears of the patient are usually examined with an otoscope to make sure they are free of wax, that the eardrum is intact, the ears are not infected, and the middle ear is free of fluid (indicating middle ear infection).

==Pure tone audiometry==
The standard and most common type of hearing test is pure tone audiometry, which measures the air and bone conduction thresholds for each ear in a set of 8 standard frequencies from 250Hz to 8000Hz. The test is conducted in a sound booth using either a pair of foam inserts or supraural headphones connected to an external audiometer. The result of the test is an audiogram diagram which plots a person&#x27;s hearing sensitivity at the tested frequencies. On an audiogram an &quot;x&quot; plot represents the softest threshold heard at each specific frequency in the left ear, and an &quot;o&quot; plot represents the softest threshold heard at each specific frequency in the right ear. There is also a high frequency version of the test which tests frequencies over 8000Hz to 16000Hz which may be employed in special circumstances.

== In-situ audiometry using mobile applications ==
The availability of stereo headphones and smartphones or tablets equipped with sound reproduction systems led to the appearance of new audiologic diagnostic methods which help people identify their degree of hearing loss without assistance. For users of these mobile devices, there are a number of applications available with a function for audiometric hearing testing. There are also hearing aid applications with a built-in hearing test for making hearing aid adjustments.

In the process of hearing test with specialized applications, initial hearing thresholds of perception of tone signals on different frequencies (audiogram) are identified.

Hearing thresholds, like with traditional audiometry, and with a special application, are determined on a standard set of frequencies from 125 Hz to 8 kHz. Also, an application can be integrated with a function for testing in various acoustic conditions.

Technically, the hearing test application consists of the following blocks:
* program module-generator of tone signals of the required frequency;
* graphic interface options (for fixing the user&#x27;s reaction to exceeding tone perception threshold);
* interpreter of test results (text and graphics);
* database with the results of previous examinations and age-normalized hearing parameters

Hearing test results obtained through the application will be in error as compared to the results of hearing test conducted by an audiologist because of the following reasons:
* the use of specialized calibrated equipment;
* sound-proofing of the room where hearing test is held;
* heterogeneity of parameters of sound-recording systems in smartphones and tablets, and also headphones or headsets;
* noise masking effect of tone signals

Despite possible errors in the results of diagnostics, the undoubted advantages of hearing testing with a special application or hearing aid application include the ability to do the hearing test without assistance and the availability of hearing testing.

Scientists suggest that the hearing test using a mobile application can be used to identify hearing pathologies and also for hearing screening tests.

==Weber and Rinne==

A complete hearing evaluation involves several other tests as well. In order to determine what kind of hearing loss is present, a bone conduction hearing test is administered. In this test, a vibrating tuning fork is placed behind the ear, on the mastoid process. When the patient can no longer feel/hear the vibration, the tuning fork is held in front of the ear; the patient should once more be able to hear a ringing sound. If they cannot, there is conductive hearing loss in that ear. Additionally, the tuning fork is placed on the forehead. The patient is then asked if the sound is localised in the centre of the head or whether it is louder in either ear. If there is conductive hearing loss, it is likely to be louder in the affected ear; if there is sensorineural hearing loss, it will be quieter in the affected ear. This test helps the audiologist determine whether the hearing loss is conductive (caused by problems in the outer or middle ear) or sensorineural (caused by problems in the cochlea, the sensory organ of hearing) or neural - caused by a problem in the auditory nerve or auditory pathways/cortex of the brain.

==Hearing in Noise==
The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) measures a person&#x27;s ability to hear speech in quiet and in noise. In the test, the patient is required to repeat sentences both in a quiet environment and with competing noise being presented from different directions. More specifically, there are four conditions: (1) sentences with no competing noise, (2) sentences with competing noise presented directly in front of the patient, (3) noise presented at 90° to the right of the patient, and (4) noise presented at 90° to the left of the patient. The test measures signal-to-noise ratio for the different conditions which corresponds to how loud the sentences needed to be played above the noise so that the patient can repeat them correctly 50% of the time.

==Words-in-Noise Test==
The Words-in-Noise Test (WIN) uses monosyllabic words presented at seven different signal-to-noise ratios with masking noise - typically speech spectrum noise. The WIN test will yield a score for a person&#x27;s ability to understand speech in a noisy background. Unlike a pure-tone audiogram, the WIN test may provide a more functional test of a person&#x27;s hearing in a situation that is likely to occur.

==Modified Rhyme Test==
The Modified Rhyme Test (MRT) is defined in the American National Standard ANSI S3.2 Methods for Measuring the Intelligibility of Speech Over Communication Systems. The method consists of 50 sets of six monosyllabic words that differ in initial or final consonant (e.g. not, tot, got, pot, hot, lot or ray, raze, rate, rave, rake, race). The listener is typically presented with one of the words in the sextet preceded by a phrase, &quot;You will mark the word ___&quot;. The six words that rhyme are presented to the listener to select what they believe to be the correct answer. The MRT has been extensively used by the US Air Force to test the performance of different communication systems, which often include a noise interference component. If a condition achieves a score of 80% correct responses or better, then that is often an acceptable performance level.

==Other==
* The audiologist or hearing instrument specialist may also conduct speech tests, wherein the patient repeats the words he or she hears.
* In addition, a test called a tympanogram is generally done. In this test, a small probe is placed in the ear and the air pressure in the ear canal is varied. This test tells the audiologist how well the eardrum and other structures in the middle ear are working. The ear canal volume indicates whether a perforation in the eardrum (tympanic membrane) may be present. The middle ear pressure indicates whether any fluid is present in the middle ear space (also called &quot;glue ear&quot; or &quot;otitis media with effusion&quot;). Compliance measurement indicates how well the eardrum and ossicles (the three ear bones) are moving.
* The last test the audiologist may perform is an acoustic reflex test. In this test a probe is placed in the ear and a loud tone, greater than 70 dBSPL, is produced. The test measures the reflexive contraction of the stapedius muscle, which is important in protecting the ear from loud noises, such as a person&#x27;s own speech which may be 90 dBSPL at the eardrum. This test can be used to give information about the vestibular and facial nerves and indicate if a lesion may be present.

<text>Power Windows is the eleventh studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on October 11, 1985 in Canada by Anthem Records and on October 21, 1985 in the United States. After touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (1984), the band took a break and reconvened in early 1985 to begin work on a follow-up. The material continued to display the band&#x27;s exploration of synthesizer-oriented music, this time with the addition of sampling, electronic drums, a string section, and choir, with power being a running lyrical theme. &quot;Power Windows&quot; was recorded in Montserrat and England with Peter Collins as co-producer and Andy Richards on additional keyboards.

The album reached No. 2 in Canada, No. 9 in the United Kingdom, and No. 10 in the United States. In January 1986, the album reached platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for one million copies sold in the United States. Rush released two singles from the album, &quot;The Big Money&quot; and &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot;. The band supported the album with their 1985–1986 tour.

==Background and writing==
In November 1984, the band ended their concert tour in support of their previous album, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (1984). After a short respite, the group started work for a follow-up album in early 1985. Guitarist Alex Lifeson looked back at this period, and noted their conscious effort in taking the strongest elements of their previous two records, &quot;Signals&quot; (1982) and &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; and capitalizing on them for &quot;Power Windows&quot;. To Lifeson, this resulted in a more cohesive and satisfying album.

In February 1985, Rush had relocated to Elora Sound Studios in Elora, Ontario to write and rehearse new songs. Drummer Neil Peart would write a set of lyrics from the studio&#x27;s farmhouse while Lifeson and frontman Geddy Lee worked on music to fit Peart&#x27;s words in the adjacent barn which housed a 24-track recording studio. Peart worked on a small desk in his room, &quot;about the right size for a five-year-old&quot;. During this time, Peart researched the Manhattan Project to write lyrics for the same-titled song. He also had a head start, having written outline lyrics for &quot;The Big Money&quot;, &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot;, and &quot;Marathon&quot; before these sessions had begun. Lee and Lifeson sorted through jams recorded at soundchecks on tour and Lifeson&#x27;s own tapes of ideas to assemble music for the three tracks, with each song taking up to a week. They then began on &quot;Middletown Dreams&quot;, &quot;Marathon&quot; once again, and then &quot;Grand Designs&quot;. Having worked out some material, Rush underwent a five-day warm-up tour in Florida in March 1985 to sharpen their performance and to test the new songs on stage prior to recording. Peart continued to work on lyrics in his hotel room in Miami.

Following their warm-up gigs, the band returned to Elora and continued working on their new songs, their break away being a positive impact on their work upon returning. Peart had initially struggled to finish &quot;Territories&quot; and &quot;Manhattan Project&quot;, &quot;but now they just fell together&quot;. On their first day back at Elora, Peart began work on lyrics for &quot;Emotion Detector&quot; as the group had discussed the possibility of recording a ballad for their new album. Upon presenting his words to Lee and Lifeson, his lyrics fit to the piece of music that his bandmates were working on at the time. This was followed by Rush arranging the music for &quot;Emotion Detector&quot; and &quot;Territories&quot;, after which they had assembled a demo tape of seven new songs ready to present to Collins for recording.

Later in 1985, Peart told an interviewer that Rush&#x27;s sound &quot;is changing from having been progressive to not being progressive&quot;. He noted that though the album might &quot;seem simpler&quot;, it was just as difficult to compose and perform. Lifeson expressed some resistance to the emphasis on keyboards during this period of their history. He noted the trend began on &quot;Signals&quot; which pushed his guitar parts too far into the background as a result. However, he thought Rush achieved a much greater balance of the two instruments on &quot;Power Windows&quot;, which he thought &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981) successfully had done.

==Production==
===Recording===
Rush recorded &quot;Power Windows&quot; from April to August 1985 in five different recording studios. The group recorded &quot;Power Windows&quot; with a new producer, Peter Collins. During their warm-up gigs in Florida, the band first met Australian engineer James &quot;Jimbo&quot; Barton, whom Collins had recommended. They accepted, and Peart later praised Barton&#x27;s contributions and suggestions to the band, considering his small recommendations to improve a song, which he referred to as &quot;events&quot;, was &quot;just what we were looking for&quot;. Lifeson compared the experience of recording &quot;Power Windows&quot; as more pleasant and fun than &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, which presented various problems for the band. He added that the album contained elements that Rush had not incorporated before and broke several boundaries that had existed with previous albums. Lee supported this view and said the group decided &quot;not to hold anything back&quot; and make the album first and focus later on the music&#x27;s onstage presentation.
Recording began at The Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, England, where the basic rhythm, keyboards, and bass tracks were recorded more quickly than usual, in the span of five weeks, to capture more spontaneous performances ready for overdubs. Here, the music was recorded using two Studer A800 24-track tape machines with an SSL console. It was during sessions at The Manor where Rush brought in musician Andy Richards to play additional synthesizers and assist in their programming. His rig consisted of a PPG Wave 2.3 synthesizer connected to a Roland Super Jupiter module through a MIDI system, a Yamaha QX-1 digital sequencer, and a Roland Jupiter-8 and Yamaha DX7 synthesizer. In one instance, Peart&#x27;s drum technician Larry Allen drove with him to London to collect a set of African and Indian drums to use on &quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot;, and bongos for &quot;Territories&quot;.

In May 1985, the band had relocated to AIR Studios in the island of Montserrat in the Caribbean. They had discussed recording at the studio for several years and booked the facility for three weeks for Lifeson to record guitar overdubs. The tracks were put down using two Studer tape recorders with a Neve console. Collins recalled this period of recording as painstaking work due to the various combination of microphone and amplifier set-ups that were experimented. This was followed by a return to England in June to record in London, firstly at SARM East Studios. The band chose to live together in a single apartment rather than separate hotel rooms. At SARM East, the guitar solos and Lee&#x27;s vocals were put down.

Mixing began in July after the band took a one-week break from the material, which coincided with decisions on the final running order, artwork, credits, and photos. In August, the string section was recorded which featured a 30-piece orchestra in studio 1 at Abbey Road Studios. Rush wanted musician and arranger Anne Dudley to complete the string arrangements, which she agreed to do, and the group was conducted by Andrew Pryce Jackman. A 25-piece choir was recorded at Angel Recording Studios for the ending of &quot;Marathon&quot;. The album completed, Lee oversaw the mastering in New York City in September, and proofs were approved for the album cover.

===Songs===
&quot;Power Windows&quot; lyrics are focused primarily on various manifestations of power. For example, &quot;Territories&quot; comments on nationalism around the world. Like &quot;Subdivisions&quot; from &quot;Signals&quot;, &quot;Middletown Dreams&quot; explores suburban monotony and the average person&#x27;s attempts to temporarily escape it. &quot;Grand Designs&quot; was partly written to criticise mainstream music which the group believed was too superficial. The song also echoes individualistic themes such as non-conformism.

&quot;The Big Money&quot; features the sampling of Peart&#x27;s voice using an AMS sampler and triggered through his Simmons drum kit.

&quot;Manhattan Project&quot; explores the development and explosion of the first nuclear weapon at the Manhattan Project. The track was difficult for the band to put together, partly due to Peart&#x27;s difficulty in writing lyrics from an objective point of view, rather than as an observer of the event. Lifeson recalled that Peart had &quot;thoroughly&quot; researched on the topic beforehand.

&quot;Territories&quot; was another difficult track for Rush to complete. After Peart had written some lyrical ideas he went through them with Lee, who noticed it was telling a story and found them difficult to sing once he and Lifeson had developed music for them. Peart then rewrote them in a more direct way which suited Lee better. It features the lyric &quot;Better beer&quot;, which is an inside joke. Peart played his drum kit without a snare drum, and the middle section features a sample of Lee&#x27;s voice saying the phrase &quot;Round and round&quot;.

&quot;Middletown Dreams&quot; involved several rewrites before the band reached a working arrangement. After the album was completed, Lifeson expressed some dissatisfaction with the guitar parts, but it grew to become a &quot;very satisfying&quot; track for him.

&quot;Marathon&quot; was anticipated by Lifeson to be difficult to arrange and record, but it turned out to be one of the easiest songs on the album to complete. It contains various samples, the fewest recorded overdubs, and incorporates the string section and choir recorded in London. Collins had the idea of using a choir and the band, upon witnessing the recording, saw the humour in having &quot;pregnant women and old men sing our song&quot;. Lifeson considered the song to be close to Peart as he had taken up cycling during days off on the &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; tour, riding 100 miles each time.

&quot;Emotion Detector&quot; was initially anticipated to be easy to complete, but was actually difficult. It is the only track on the album that the band never performed live.

&quot;Mystic Rhythms&quot;, as described by Lee, is &quot;the most synthetic track on the record&quot; with each instrument being fed through &quot;a synthesized something&quot;. It features Lifeson playing an acoustic Ovation guitar which generated a synthesizer-like sound once fed through amplification.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Power Windows&quot; has been met with mostly positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Eduardo Rivadavia retrospectively described the album as Rush&#x27;s coldest album, citing the sparse, horn-like guitar playing of Lifeson, the prominent synthesizer of Lee and Peart&#x27;s crisp, clinical percussion and stark lyrical themes. However, he also described the album as one that rewards patience and repeated listens. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, in a positive review of the album, highlighted a number of bands that seemingly influenced &quot;Power Windows&quot;, such as The Police, U2, Genesis, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The review concludes that &quot;Power Windows&quot; may be the missing link between Yes and the Sex Pistols. In 2005, the album was ranked number 382 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. It was also in the top ten of a 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; website reader poll of best Rush albums.

&quot;Power Windows&quot; introduced more synthesizers into the band&#x27;s sound. During the period when the album was produced, the band were expanding into new directions from their progressive rock base, having &quot;tightened up their sidelong suites and rhythmic abstractions into balled-up song fists, art-pop blasts of angular, slashing guitar, spatial keyboards and hyperpercussion, all resolved with forthright melodic sense&quot;.

==Reissues==
Although the original recording had a SPARS code of DDD and was considered to be of good quality, a remastered edition was issued in 1997. The remastered edition follows the industry&#x27;s more recent trend of the loudness war, as it is considerably louder.

<text>Lake George (orWeereewa or Ngungara in the Ngunnawal language) is an endorheic lake in south-eastern New South Wales, Australia. It is approximately north-east of Canberra located adjacent to the Federal Highway en route to Canberra and Sydney. Lake George is also the name of a locality on the western and southern edges of the lake, within the area of the Queanbeyan–Palerang Regional Council.

==Geography and hydrology==
Lake George is an endorheic lake, as it has no outflow of water to rivers and oceans.

The lake is believed to be more than a million years old. Originally, small streams drained its catchment into the Yass River, but then the Lake George Escarpment rose due to major crust movement along a strong fault line, blocking this drainage and forming the lake. Lake George has in previous Ice Ages been much larger and deeper.

The thickness of sediment beneath the lake exceeds , according to a Bureau of Mineral Resources Canberra drilling programme in the 1982/83 summer. The oldest sediments, which lie some distance above the bedrock, were dated at 4–5 million years using spore and pollen analysis and magnetic-reversal stratigraphy.

At long and wide, Lake George is long, largely flat and extremely shallow, with a very small catchment. Resultant evaporation rates as well as a tendency for strong winds to blow the water back on itself explain the mysterious filling and drying episodes on both short term (hours) and long term (years) time scales that have been observed.

The lake&#x27;s depth when full can range from ; however in many areas it is only around deep. Its deepest point has been measured as . When full, the lake holds about of water. Between the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the lake lapped the Federal Highway on its western edge.

Lake George is one of the most studied lakes in Australia. The palaeontologist Patrick De Deckker has commented that &quot;it is actually a depression that turns into a lake when it fills. There’s always water below the lake floor, and amazingly, it is saline, but if you have more rainfall, the lake fills up&quot;.

==Activities==
Lake George is the site of an experimental scientific wave behaviour platform established by researchers from the Civil Engineering department of the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.

Lake George has been a popular fishery at times, after high water levels and stockings of fish.

Since the 1960s hang gliders have been flown from the escarpment when easterly winds form standing waves. Pilots can then fly along the length of the lake. Unpowered model aircraft are also flown from this area, and powered models are flown from the lake floor.

Wine grapes are grown along the western edge of the lake, on the escarpment. Sheep are grazed on the lake when it is dry or nearly so.

===Public art===
Lake George was an important subject for the Canberra artist, Rosalie Gascoigne (1917–1999) who told Kate Davidson in 1996 that she &quot;was enraptured with the feeling of getting out of my car at the top of the range above Lake George and Gundaroo and seeing Australia stretch away under a big dome of sky. Nothing is there, but everything is there. It was very free and uncalculated. You cannot really express it in concrete terms, you have to be elusive and allusive at the same time.&quot; (Davidson, Kate and Michael Desmond, Islands: Contemporary installations from Australia, Asia, Europe and America, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, 1996). Works inspired by Lake George include &quot;Pale landscape&quot; 1977 (Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington), &quot;Feathered fence&quot; 1978-79 and &quot;Suddenly the lake&quot; 1994–95 (both National Gallery of Australia), &quot;But mostly air&quot; 1994–95 (Art Gallery of South Australia) and &quot;Lake&quot; 1991 (Garangula Gallery NSW). &quot;Pale landscape&quot; 1977 and &quot;Feathered fence&quot; 1978-79 were both made with thousands of swans feathers found at a sanctuary at the southern end of the lake in the mid-1970s, the swans are no longer there since the lake dried up.

In 2010, Canberra artists Alan and Julie Aston installed a herd of zebra sculptures on the lake adjacent to the highway stop commemorating Kevin &quot;Dasher&quot; Wheatley VC, used as a &quot;Driver Reviver&quot; site. They were named Stopper, Reviver, Survivor, and Dasher. They were a sensation, but the Government of New South Wales ordered that they be removed, following a complaint from the leaseholder of the land. They reappeared at Floriade in September 2010, along with a baby, George.

===Folklore===
The lake is the setting for several stories of haunting and UFO sightings, and has been the setting for a ghost tour run by Tim the Yowie Man.

==History==
The foreshore of what is now known as Lake George mainly lies within the traditional lands of the Gundungarra, but its south-western foreshore is at the extreme east of the traditional lands of the Ngunnawal people. These two peoples spoke a very similar, if not identical, language. The traditional lands of the Ngarigo people probably also extend to the lake&#x27;s southern shoreline, in the area now known as Bungendore. The lake lies not far from the traditional lands of the Walbanga people (a group of the Yuin from the upper Shoalhaven catchment), to the east. Backed artefact manufacturing workshops have been identified at the lake, dating back to the late Holocene. Based on the recurring shapes of the stone artefacts, these workshops have been interpreted as a place where broken composite tools were being rehafted.

The local indigenous people called the lake &quot;Werriwa&quot; (originally spelled &quot;Weereewa&quot; in the journals of the explorers who noted the name), which may mean &quot;bad water&quot;; even when full, the lake is one of the saltiest bodies of water in inland NSW, almost as saline as seawater. However, the name is also similar to regional indigenous word for eagle, which often fly there. One of the original 75 electoral divisions of the Australian House of Representatives in 1901 was named &quot;Werriwa&quot;, the original Aboriginal name of the lake. By 1913, it no longer included the lake, and the electorate is currently centred in the south-western suburbs of Sydney.

The first European to visit the lake was Joseph Wild on 19 August 1820, and it was named for King George III on 28 October 1820 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, who was touring the area as part of a Royal Commission inquiring into the condition of the Colony. Land grants on the northern shoreline of the lake had been made to colonial settlers as early as 1824.

A separate body of water—Murray&#x27;s Lagoon—once existed close to the northern end of the lake, adjoining the property, Ajamatong, owned by Terence Aubrey Murray. In the mid-1830s Murray used convict labour to build a 50 m long, stone-lined canal, excavated to up to 4m into the ground, with the aim of connecting the two bodies of water. Unfortunately, the level of the lagoon was slightly higher than the lake, and the canal was a failure. The canal still exists and passes under The Vineyards Road (the old Federal Highway), on private property, continuing as a drainage culvert under the modern-day Federal Highway.

In the 1850s, Murray&#x27;s Lagoon was stocked with Murray cod fished out of the Molonglo River at Murray&#x27;s other property, Yarralumla. At some time, Murray&#x27;s Lagoon overflowed and introduced a translocated population of Murray cod into the lake itself. They bred rapidly and, from the 1850s to the 1890s; Lake George abounded with them. The long Federation Drought commenced in the mid-1890s, and by 1902 the lake had dried out completely. In their search for water to survive in, the Murray cod flocked into the mouths of the few small creeks feeding the lake and died there by the thousands.

Immediately north of the lake, at Currawang, copper ore was mined and smelted at various times, from 1865 to around 1908. For many years, the old mine workings and waste heaps remained exposed and contaminated runoff water was entering Lake George, via a creek that ran through the mining area. After a new lead-silver-zinc ore deposit was identified nearby, in 1973, part of the new work undertaken, from 1987 onward, was to rehabilitate the 19th-century mine workings and stop the contamination of the lake. All mining at Currawang has now ceased.

In 1886, a site was reserved for a village to be known as Murray, on the northern shoreline of the lake, just west of the landform known as Kenny&#x27;s Point. Although the village was surveyed and allotments put up for sale in 1887 and 1910, the village seems not to have developed. Its design was cancelled in 1919. It was located just beyond the end of modern-day Lake George Road. To this day there is no town or village on the lake&#x27;s shoreline.

In the early 1900s, an area immediately to the south-east of the lake and north-north-east of Bungendore, was surveyed as a possible site for the capital city of Australia. The city would have extended from close to the Lake George shoreline to the Bombala railway line. Although it had the advantage of an existing railway connection, the site presented difficulties, particularly in supplying it with sufficient fresh water and the variability of the water level in Lake George. Instead, the Australian Capital Territory and city of Canberra were established some south-west of the lake.

The selection of Canberra as the national capital brought pressure for a more direct route by road from Sydney, resulting in the construction of the Federal Highway, which opened in December 1930; part of its route follows the western shore of the lake.

During World War II, a wooden &#x27;dummy&#x27; ship was floated on the lake and used for bombing practice by the Royal Australian Air Force. It is possible that there is still unexploded ordnance settled into the lake bed.

On 8 July 1956 five cadets from the Royal Military College, Duntroon died due to hypothermia in a yachting accident.

Due to the drought in New South Wales, Lake George dried out completely in November 2002, and remained so until February 2010 when it started to refill. The previous time the lake had dried out completely was during a severe drought in the 1940s, although it was partially dry in 1986, leaving large pools of water. When the lake is empty it is used by farmers to graze sheep and cattle. During September 2016, the lake filled for the first time since 1996. In the intervening years the level of water in the lake had never been as high as that in September 2016.

Rain during August 2020 helped to partly fill the lake again after several more years of drought. In December 2021, the Lake was full once again.

The unusual fluctuations in the water level have given rise to fanciful urban myths that the lake is somehow connected to lakes in Peru or South Africa, although NSW government ecologist Justin Nancarrow theorises that the lake may indeed be connected to the nearby Yass River by subterranean aquifers which pass under the surrounding escarpment, and that this connection may explain the salinity of the river.

==Wind-power generation==
The Capital Wind Farm completed in 2009 is located along the south-eastern side of Lake George.

==Locality==

Lake George is a locality covering territory on the western and southern edges of the lake, stretching east to the Bombala railway line. The locality is largely within the area of the Queanbeyan–Palerang Regional Council, although some hillside areas are in the Yass Valley Council. At the , it had a population of 118. The locality is generally rural-residential in character along the lake shore. A former grazier&#x27;s homestead at Silver Wattle Point now operates as a religious retreat and Quaker meeting house. Located in the eastern section of the locality close to the town of Bungendore are some industrial facilities, including a sand quarry and an electrical substation serving the Capital Wind Farm.

<text>Devils Lake is a lake in the U.S. state of North Dakota. It is the largest natural body of water and the second-largest body of water in North Dakota after Lake Sakakawea. It can reach a level of before naturally flowing into the Sheyenne River via the Tolna Coulee. On June 27, 2011, it reached an unofficial historical high elevation of . The cities of Devils Lake and Minnewaukan take their name from the lake as does the Spirit Lake Reservation, which is located on the lake&#x27;s southern shores.

==History==
The present site of Devils Lake is historically territory of the Dakota people. The Sisseton, Wahpeton, and Cut-Head bands of Dakotas were relocated to the Spirit Lake Reservation as a result of the 1867 treaty with the United States that established a reservation for Dakotas who had not been forcibly relocated to Crow Creek Reservation in what is now called South Dakota. The name &quot;Devils Lake&quot; is a calque of the Dakota words &quot;mni&quot; (water) &quot;wak&#x27;áŋ&quot; (literally &quot;pure source&quot;, also translated as &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot;). The Dakota consider it holy because they believe it is the home of the underwater serpent Unktehi. The Dakota name is reflected in the name of the Spirit Lake Tribe and the nearby town of Minnewaukan. European-American settlers mistranslated the name to mean &quot;Bad Spirit Lake&quot;, or &quot;Devils Lake&quot;. The &quot;bad&quot; referred to the high salinity of the lake, making it unfit to drink, and &quot;spirit&quot; meant the mirages often seen across the water. The Christian concept of the devil is not present in Dakota philosophy. The Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nations also accessed the lake, and the Arikara name for it is &quot;čiwahaahwaarúxti&quot; and the Hidatsa name is &quot;mirixubaash&quot; (&quot;sacred water&quot;).

==Geography==

Devils Lake is located in Ramsey County and Benson County in northeastern North Dakota. The Spirit Lake Tribe occupies most of the southern shore and has been adversely affected by flooding since the 1990s.

==Hydrology==
Devils Lake is the endorheic, or closed, lake of a drainage basin of some , the Devils Lake Basin. The lake collects around 86 percent of the basin&#x27;s water runoff. Above an elevation of AMSL, the lake spills into neighboring Stump Lake. At , the combined lake flows naturally into the Sheyenne River, though the lake has not reached this level in approximately 1,000 years. The Sheyenne River is a tributary to the Red River, which flows into Canada, with eventual exit into the Hudson Bay. Dike protection is set at .

Under normal conditions, Devils Lake is shallow, saline, and hypereutrophic (very high in nutrients). During periods of excessive precipitation, however, the lake can be up to deep, eutrophic (rich in minerals, nutrients, and organisms), with decreased salinity due to dilution.

===Salinity===
Because Devils Lake is endorheic, the lake tends to be much higher in salinity than the lakes with outlets to river systems. This is similar to the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Lower water levels increase salinity, threatening fish and wildlife. Salinity levels in the lake have been one prominent aspect of the debate over diversion of lake water into the Sheyenne River, with questions of the potential environmental impact of the diverted water on downstream rivers, lakes, and communities.

===Flooding===

Devils Lake is well known for its wide variations in lake levels, with large swings between low and high water levels. This owes in large part to its nature as a closed-basin lake, lacking a natural outlet. The release of water is dependent upon evaporation and seepage.

The low, flat terrain around Devils Lake consists of various coulees, channels, and basins, which may be separated during times of low water, or connected during high water. Thus the boundaries of the lake can vary greatly from year to year, depending on the amount of precipitation.

The draining of wetlands to develop agricultural land in the area has aggravated flooding at Devils Lake. Drainage of the basin&#x27;s wetlands and conversion of the basin&#x27;s native prairie to cropland has resulted in water moving more rapidly into the lake, increasing water levels. In addition, the diversion of natural water flows is also considered to have contributed to the flooding.

An increase in precipitation between 1993 and 1999 caused the lake to double in size, forcing the displacement of more than 300 homes and flooding of farmland. The Spirit Lake Tribe, whose reservation is along part of the lake, suffered considerable damage to homes and lands. Attempts to mitigate the flooding have reportedly cost North Dakota and the U.S. government more than $450 million. Efforts to control flooding include artificial outlets, dike construction and moving railroad lines, roads, and power lines. Future climate as projected by 17 different global climate models indicates overall increase in both precipitation and temperature in the Devils Lake region leading to the lake&#x27;s overspill probability (24–47% without the outlet and 3.5–14.4% with the full capacity outlet) into the nearby Sheyenne River.

In response to the flooding, the U.S. Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to research construction of an outlet in 1997 to control the lake level through methods other than evaporation or natural overflow. The Corps&#x27; design included mechanisms for filtration and monitoring of the water, and was estimated to cost $186.5 million.

The state of North Dakota objected to the cost and certain water quality provisions of the plan, and declined to participate in construction of the Corps&#x27; outlet. In 2003, the state constructed its own outlet to divert water from Devils Lake into the Sheyenne River, at a cost of $28 million. The outlet was completed in 2005, but was not operated in 2006 due to water quality and biota issues. The National Weather Service is the official federal government agency responsible for observing and predicting water levels at Devils Lake.

==Recreation==
Devils Lake has been known for a long time for fishing and other watersports. It has been named the perch capital of the world. There are a number of boat ramps and other facilities around the lake to facilitate recreational activities on the lake. Recreation in the form of open water and ice fishing is estimated to have generated more than $20 million annually.

White Horse Hill National Game Preserve is located on the lake&#x27;s southern shore. Grahams Island State Park is located on an island in the lake. Other parks on the lake include Black Tiger State Recreation Area and Shelvers Grove State Recreation Area, which is now closed due to the lake&#x27;s flooding.

==Issues and controversies==

===Outlet controversy===
During the most recent wet cycle which began in 1993, the lake rose over , inundating of primarily agricultural land. This required the expenditure of more than $400 million in flood protection measures. Some stakeholders argued for construction of an emergency outlet into the Sheyenne River, which is a tributary of the Red River of the North.

The Army Corps of Engineers proposed to draw water from a different point of the lake, provide filtration, and discharge a maximum of of water from Devil&#x27;s Lake, in order to lessen dependence on overflow or evaporation to reduce water levels. The Corps of Engineers estimated its project costs to amount to $186.5 million, with the United States Congress designating $100 million to the project; North Dakota would have paid the remaining amount. Because the project potentially affected the Red River of the North, which runs into Canadian waters, the project was considered to be subject to the Boundary Waters Treaty, and international issues were raised.

Led by Republican Governor John Hoeven, North Dakota objected to the water quality provisions and the amount of funding required. Instead it constructed its own outlet, with approval of the North Dakota Department of Health, the U.S. State Department, and Council on Environmental Quality. This outlet, which cost $28 million, has a lower maximum discharge than the federal proposal (limited to a maximum of by the Section 402 NDPDES Permit); its gravel filter removes only larger organisms. But it has provided some relief to the flood problem. Construction began in 2003 and was completed as of summer 2005.

The state outlet project was opposed by the governments of Minnesota and Manitoba, Canada. They argue the outlet would create the potential for the transfer of unknown foreign aquatic species and high levels of sulfates into the Red River basin, an important agricultural area, and Lake Winnipeg, the world&#x27;s 10th-largest freshwater lake.

In March 2004, Manitoba, along with Minnesota and several environmental groups, sued the North Dakota Department of Health in state court over the Devils Lake Outlet 402 NDPDES Permit. The court ruled the outlet could proceed in August 2004 and May 2005.

The Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 established an intermediary, the International Joint Commission (IJC), through which the United States and Canada can solve cross-boundary water disputes, but the commission has no power to act without invocation by both nations. Canada attempted to invoke the IJC for purposes of conflict resolution, but the United States did not, effectively preventing the IJC from taking part in the controversy.

The Government of Canada argues that the diversion by the state, without consultation or approval from Canada, is a violation of the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 and Canada&#x27;s national sovereignty. The U.S. government contends the diversion will not be harmful, nor will it violate the treaty under current conditions.

In November 2005, a joint United States and Canadian study concluded that none of the 13 species Canada classifies as invasive were present in Devils Lake. The study did find three species of fish parasites that are not currently known to exist in Lake Winnipeg (to which the Red River flows). However, all three are ubiquitous to the waters of North America and have a wide variety of hosts. A difficulty inherent in determining what species are in Devils Lake versus Lake Winnipeg results from spatial relationships and scale.

Lake Winnipeg covers approximately , dozens of times as large as Devils Lake. In addition, the Devils Lake Basin is significantly smaller than the watersheds feeding Lake Winnipeg, including the Saskatchewan River basin at approximately . Drawing conclusions about the biological community already in Lake Winnipeg is difficult, due to the relative lack of biological sampling there compared to that of the smaller Devils Lake.

===Carp===
Due to the rising waters of the Devils Lake and its basin, streams can flow into the Red River Valley or the Devils Lake Basin. The Red River Valley basin contains a &quot;rough fish&quot;, the common carp, which the North Dakota Game and Fish Department fears will enter Devils Lake basin waters in the near future, allowing the carp to populate Devils Lake. The carp&#x27;s fast reproductive growth and the lack of carp predators in the lake will likely help it to dramatically increase in population. This could have drastic consequences for existing populations of game fish, such as the walleye and northern pike, which could greatly harm the sport fishing industry.

Some preventive measures have been proposed, including inserting chemicals in the creeks along the boundary of the Devils Lake Basin and the Red River Valley to kill fish. Biologists did tests in 2005 which conclude that there are currently no carp in the Devils Lake Basin, but some have been found within two miles (3 km). The carp appear to have been stalled by the abundant cattail plants, which makes travel impossible for the fish.

===Railroad problems===

Due to the lake&#x27;s rising waters, the BNSF Railway temporarily suspended freight traffic between Devils Lake and Churchs Ferry, a total of , during 2009–2013. However, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; continued to operate over this segment. BNSF offered Amtrak the right to instead operate the &quot;Empire Builder&quot; over the Northern Transcon route, to which freight traffic had been shifted. To compensate for the loss of station stops at Grand Forks, Devils Lake, and Rugby, North Dakota that would have been caused by the shift, BNSF suggested that Amtrak add a station stop at New Rockford, North Dakota. However, Amtrak said that they would continue using the line by the lake. In 2010, analysts estimated that Amtrak would soon either have to rebuild the bridge that crosses the lake at Churchs Ferry, or reroute its passenger trains.

On June 15, 2011, BNSF and Amtrak agreed to rebuild the rail line, whereby each would cover one-third of the cost. The state of North Dakota received a federal TIGER grant to pay for the remaining third. The growth of freight traffic associated with oil from the Bakken formation in this period resulted in BNSF upgrading its assessment of the importance of the Devils Lake line. After the track was rebuilt and raised, through service resumed from Devils Lake to Churchs Ferry.

<doc id="563769" wikidata="Q144094" url="?curid=563769" title="Nothobranchius">
<text>Nothobranchius is a genus of small, freshwater killifish, classified in the family Nothobranchiidae in the order Cyprinodontiformes. There are about a hundred species in the genus, many with very small distributions. They are primarily native to East Africa from Sudan to northern South Africa, whereas a dozen species are found in the upper Congo River Basin; the greatest species richness is in Tanzania.

&quot;Nothobranchius&quot; typically inhabit ephemeral pools that are filled only during the monsoon season, and show extreme life-history adaptations to survive the dry season. When their habitats dry up, the adult fish die and the eggs survive encased in the clay during the dry season. The embryos survive the dry season by entering diapause, facilitated by their specialized eggs that have a very hard chorion and are resistant to desiccation and hypoxia. These species reach maturity very quickly once diapause is broken and have a very short life span; one species, &quot;Nothobranchius furzeri&quot;, reaches maturity in 17 days and seldom lives beyond 6 months.

==Etymology==
From Greek νοθοσ / &quot;nothos&quot;: false, spurious, and βράγχια / &quot;bránchia&quot;: gill.

<text>The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports is an American radio-turned-television program by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) that ran from 1942 to 1960. The program included broadcasts of a variety of sports, although it is primarily remembered for its focus on boxing matches.

==Overview and background==
The &quot;Cavalcade of Sports&quot; officially began on radio in 1942 as the Gillette Company grouped various existing sports sponsorships under one banner. The sponsorships had begun three years earlier, according to an article on the Gillette Company in Vol. 68 of the &quot;International Directory of Company Histories&quot;. In 1939, Gillette president Joseph Spang purchased the sponsorship rights to the World Series on behalf of Gillette for $100,000. A special promotion of Gillette razors and blueblades sold four times better than company estimates, resulting in the company seeking out additional sponsorships for sporting events.

The Gillette stable of radio sports programs spanned several different networks (including the NBC Red Network, CBS Radio Network and the Mutual Broadcasting System) and grew to include not only ongoing sponsorship deals with Major League Baseball for the World Series and All-Star Game, but the annual Kentucky Derby horse race and the Cotton Bowl Classic and Orange Bowl in college football. In his book about Gillette&#x27;s history &quot;Cutting Edge&quot;, author Gordon McKibben wrote, &quot;most males in the 1940s and 1950s did not have to be told that the &quot;Cavalcade of Sports&quot; meant Gillette was sponsoring another ball game or horse race&quot;.

The diversified field of sporting events continued onto television, reportedly including at least two golfing tournaments as well as college football&#x27;s Blue–Gray Classic and (beginning in 1958) the Rose Bowl game. As late as 1988, the &quot;Cavalcade of Sports&quot; banner was used in connection with Gillette&#x27;s sponsorship of the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup Playoffs. Internationally, the &quot;Gillette World Sports&quot; program continues the concept to the present day in many international regions from Ireland to Africa to Asia.

With all of this, however, the &quot;Cavalcade of Sports&quot; was best known for its Friday night boxing broadcasts that aired on NBC from 1946 to 1960, and then, after NBC decided against featuring boxing due to sensitivity over criminal allegations in the sport, for several more years on ABC.

===As &quot;Cavalcade of Sports&quot;===
Its earlier iteration, &quot;Cavalcade of Sports&quot;, likewise a boxing show, ran on NBC&#x27;s New York City station WNBT (channel 4, now WNBC) intermittently beginning in 1943 and was picked up by the NBC television network three years later. The twice-weekly 1946 shows began on Monday, November 8 at 9:00 p.m. and Friday, November 12 at 9:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Both were open-ended programs – as the station signed off the air after the last bout ended (in the early days of television, most stations did not have late-night local newscasts).

St. Nicholas Arena in New York City was the site of the earliest bouts and continued to host the Monday night fights until that program&#x27;s cancellation in May 1949.

===As &quot;Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot;===
The Friday night program, broadcast from Madison Square Garden lasted until June 24, 1960, a 14-year period which is, by far, the longest continuous run of any boxing program in television history. The Gillette sponsorship began at the start of the first full television programming season, 1948-49. On September 4, the program was retitled &quot;The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports&quot;, a name that remained until the end of its run. Every great boxer of the time – including among others Rocky Marciano, Sugar Ray Robinson, Archie Moore, Rocky Graziano, Willie Pep – appeared on one or more of its broadcasts.

In the early years of television, there was a saturation of boxing programs, as many as six prime-time network programs in one week, not even counting the myriad local shows. With so much boxing airing simultaneously, all weight divisions had a chance at stardom, not just heavyweight contenders.

===Commentators===
Bob Haymes (using the stage name Bob Stanton) was the program&#x27;s original announcer; he was joined by Ray Forrest in 1948. Jimmy Powers took over the role in 1949 and remained NBC&#x27;s main boxing announcer until the network ceased carrying prime time boxing matches in 1960.

===Theme music===
The show&#x27;s theme music was the &quot;Look Sharp/Be Sharp March&quot; by Mahlon Merrick, an upbeat tune that was recorded, published (and sheet music printed) sometime between 1953 and 1956. It received quite a bit of airplay on U.S. radio programs, and was used in the repertoire of many high school and college bands of the period. There is a 1954 rendition of the song by the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler on YouTube.

The &quot;March&quot; was used in the 1980 film &quot;Raging Bull&quot; during a scene in which the Robert De Niro character Jake LaMotta unveils his new nightclub. Coleco&#x27;s Head-to-Head Boxing handheld video game, released in 1981, played the most identifiable eight-note part of the tune when turned on and the first three notes of that at the start of each round. The music is also used in the &quot;Punch-Out!!&quot; series of video games published by Nintendo, and the 1993 Argentine film &quot;Gatica, el mono&quot;.

==Latin America==

In the late 1940s, when the &quot;Cavalcade&quot; was aired through NBC Red Network extended their Spanish programming activities to Latin American countries, where it was known as the &quot;Cabalgata Deportiva Gillette&quot;. Its schedule included the MLB Game of the Week aired on Saturday afternoons, the MLB All-Star Game in the midseason and the fall World Series. On there, shared duties Spanish-language broadcasters such as Pancho Pepe Cróquer, Buck Canel, and Felo Ramírez. During the opening presentation, Canel habitually introduced Cróquer as &quot;La Voz Deportiva de América&quot;.

In addition, the &quot;Cavalcade&quot; broadcast the bouts of every great fighter of the time, including Rocky Marciano, Archie Moore, Willie Pep, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sandy Saddler and Jersey Joe Walcott, whose fights were accurately and succinctly described by Cróquer on its Friday nights broadcasts from Madison Square Garden. He is particularly remembered for his emotional description on the second of four matches held between Pep and Saddler, which was aired in February 1949.

==United Kingdom==
The imitatively-titled, but otherwise unrelated, series &quot;Cavalcade of Sport&quot; aired on ITV in the United Kingdom in 1956, early in the British commercial network&#x27;s life.

<doc id="563775" wikidata="Q705829" url="?curid=563775" title="Mildura">
<text>Mildura ( ) is a regional city in north-west Victoria, Australia. Located on the Victorian side of the Murray River, Mildura had a population of 34,565 at the 2021 census. When nearby Wentworth, Irymple, Nichols Point, Merbein and Red Cliffs are included, the combined urban area had a population of 58,914 in 2021, having grown marginally at an average annual rate of 1.3% year-on-year over the preceding five years.

Mildura is the largest settlement in the Sunraysia region, where around 90% of Australia&#x27;s table grape exports are grown. Likewise, it is a major horticultural centre notable for its overall (table, sultana and wine) grape production, supplying about 80% of Victoria&#x27;s grapes. Many wineries also source grapes from Mildura. It is very close to the New South Wales border, the Murray River, from which it draws an abundant supply of irrigation water. It is known as Australia&#x27;s first &#x27;irrigation colony&#x27;.

The city&#x27;s central business district is located just a short distance from the banks of the Murray. Langtree Avenue is the main shopping and dining precinct in Mildura, with the middle section of the street a pedestrian mall. The other major retail precinct is along Fifteenth Street in the Mildura South area, where a mid-sized undercover shopping mall and several big box stores are located. The city&#x27;s name was taken from the Mildura homestead, an early sheep station which covered most of the area. The urban area of Mildura is surrounded by irrigated horticulture, where the original grape and citrus blocks were located with water irrigated from the Murray River.

== History ==
Mildura has a long history of orange and grape farming, and an even longer history of Aboriginal occupation. This includes the Latje Latje and Ngintait peoples, amongst others, being the original inhabitants of present-day Mildura. 

=== Toponymy ===
There are several theories as to the origin of the name Mildura. While it was the name of the sheep station, without precedent in the English language, most historians believe it to have originated from Aboriginal Australian words. However, the etymology of Mildura is not certain, as in several local dialects, the words &quot;mill&quot; and &quot;dura&quot; have different meanings. The word &quot;dura&quot; is generally thought to mean &quot;earth&quot;, &quot;sand&quot; or &quot;rock&quot; in the local Ladji Ladji language. However, usage of the word &quot;mill&quot; varies by dialect and may mean &quot;red&quot; or &quot;water&quot;, and thus, interpretations of the name can vary from &quot;red earth&quot; to &quot;water rock&quot;.

=== Prehistory and European settlement ===

Many Aboriginal people lived around the site of Mildura because of the abundant food. Local tribes included the Latjilatji and Jarijari.

The first Europeans in the area arrived in 1857 and brought sheep to graze the rich pastures.

=== Irrigation settlement ===
A major drought in Victoria from 1877 to 1884 prompted Alfred Deakin, then a minister in the State Government and chairman of a Royal Commission on water supply, to visit the irrigation areas of California. There he met George and William Chaffey.

In 1886, Canadian-American irrigator George Chaffey came to Australia and selected a derelict sheep station known as Mildura as the site for his first irrigation settlement, signing an agreement with the Victorian government to spend at least £300,000 on permanent improvements at Mildura in the next twenty years.

After much political wrangling, the settlement of Mildura was established in 1887. The Post Office opened on 23 January 1888.

=== Growth ===

The nearby towns of Wentworth, Gol Gol, Curlwaa and Yelta sprang up in the mid-to-late 19th century. In the 1890s came the scourge of the rabbit. This devastated the sheep farmers, especially south of the Murray. There was also a financial recession at this time. Combined, these factors restricted growth of the new settlement.

After this period, the new settlement grew and grew. It was soon the main town of the district. Suburbs and new satellite towns sprang up. From the 1920s, a number of &#x27;suburban&#x27; train services were established to Merbein and Red Cliffs. These were operated by railcars.

In 1934, Mildura was officially proclaimed a city.

Post war Mildura experienced a large influx of migrants particularly from European and Mediterranean countries including Italy and Greece. Many of these migrants were attracted by the opportunities for unskilled labour offered by the fruit picking industry.

=== Nowingi toxic waste proposal ===

In 2004, there was a controversial proposal by the Victorian Government to build a state-level Long Term Containment Facility (LTCF) for Industrial Waste in Nowingi, approximately 50 km south of Mildura. The site is a small enclave of state forest surrounded by national park, and contains habitat important to a number of threatened species.

The abandoning of the LTCF proposal was received with jubilation by opponents of the LTCF, not only in the Mildura area and elsewhere in Victoria, but also across the border in South Australia where there were fears that the toxic waste might affect the water supply via the Murray River and thereby the fruit-growing industries of the Riverland and Murraylands.

The Mildura Rural City Council and residents spent almost $2 million fighting the Government&#x27;s proposal for the LTCF at Nowingi. On 10 January 2007 the Victorian Government did not rule out some form of reimbursement for the council&#x27;s legal and other costs in opposing the LTCF. &quot;The general rule is that people bear their own costs, that is most likely to apply in this case ... but I&#x27;ve indicated and I am prepared to talk to the council and mayor about the whole issue of how Mildura moves forward and I&#x27;ll do that,&quot; John Thwaites said.

=== World ballooning championships ===
In late June to early July 2004, the 16th World Hot Air Ballooning Championships was held in Mildura,

== Geography ==

=== Topography ===
Mildura is situated on flat land without hills or mountains on the southern bank of the Murray River and surrounded to the west, north and east by lakes and billabongs including Lake Hawthorn, Lake Ranfurly and Lake Gol Gol. Several towns surround Mildura on the flat plains including Merbein to the west as well as Irymple and Red Cliffs to the south which could be considered suburban areas or satellite towns separated by small stretches of open farmland.

While the land along the river and irrigation channels is fertile, much of the land around Mildura is also dry, saline and semi-arid.

=== Urban structure ===
Mildura is a largely low-rise and low density urban area that is overwhelmingly dependent upon private vehicles for transportation. Residential dwellings consist almost solely of single-family detached homes on relatively large allotments. The population has been growing rapidly for several decades with most of the residential growth occurring in the south, south western and more recently the eastern parts of the urban area.

The central business district (CBD) is located at the northern end of the urban area, fronting onto the Murray River. The main shopping street of Mildura is Langtree Avenue, which features a pedestrian mall and shopping centre. The area between Seventh and Eight Streets is known as Feast Street, and is home to many boutique eateries and beverage dispensaries. The combined (CBD) area, known as City Heart, complements the Mildura Central Shopping Centre, located at the opposite end of the urban area on the corner of Fifteenth Street and Deakin Avenue. The latter, so named after Alfred Deakin, &#x27;the Victorian Cabinet Minister who introduced the concept of an irrigated settlement in Australia&#x27;, itself runs around twelve kilometres in a south-west direction from Seventh Street before terminating in peri-urban farmland. Fifteenth Street is the main strip of big box stores, car dealerships and other commercial enterprises.

The tallest buildings are exemplified by the two-storey 1934 Old Mildura Base Hospital, two-storey Marina Dockside apartments completed in 2010 and the three-storey tower/spire of the 1920s T&amp;G building. Other notable tall structures that serve as literal landmarks in the city include the &#x27;new&#x27; water tower, built in the 1950s, and the &#x27;old&#x27; water tower, now partially subsumed by a hotel.

=== Climate ===
Mildura has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers and cool winters. It is only about 50 metres above sea level despite being several hundred kilometres from the coast. It enjoys 132.0 clear days annually.

Rainfall totals are about 280 mm a year and are spread evenly across the months and seasons with winter and spring having the most rainy days.

Average maximum temperatures range from a hot in summer to a cool in winter. Minimum temperatures range from around in summer to in winter, when frost is common and often destructive to irrigated crops. Mildura experiences some very hot days in summer with temperatures exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) on a number of days per year, however are at times succeeded by cold fronts off the Bight.

Mildura got record daily rainfall on 5 February 2011 with .

== Economy ==
=== Fruit and wine production ===

Mildura is also known as the centre of &quot;Victoria&#x27;s Food Bowl&quot; and is a major producer of citrus fruits (especially oranges), and wine. It is also notable for its grape production, supplying 80% of Victoria&#x27;s grapes. Many wineries also source grapes from Mildura. The local area produces more than 70% of Australia&#x27;s dried vine fruits.

==== Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone ====
Mildura is part of the Fruit Fly Exclusion Zone, in which fruits or vegetables may not be taken into the area (they can, however, be taken out). This is to stop the Queensland fruit fly from invading crops and plantations which could have a devastating effect on the economy. Disposal bins into which fruit can be disposed of are located along highways entering the zone.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is a A$210 million industry in Mildura. However, a large percentage (30%) are domestic tourists visiting friends or relatives.

The city&#x27;s situation on the Murray River makes it a hub for watersports, paddlesteamers and boat cruises. The still conditions make Mildura ideal for hot air ballooning and the Mildura International Balloon Fiesta attracts many visitors. The Australian Inland Botanic Gardens, located nearby in Mourquong is another popular attraction which draws visitors to the city.
=== Mildura Central ===
Mildura Central&#x27;s (formerly Centro Mildura) extensive redevelopment in 2005 has positioned the centre as the major shopping destination within the Sunraysia region. Mildura Central is also the only fully enclosed, air-conditioned shopping centre in this area and offers a retail mix including representation from a number of national fashion stores. Serving a primary trade area population of 60,000 residents, Mildura Central also receives consumers from beyond the trade area including the Riverland, Swan Hill, Robinvale and Broken Hill. It includes a large Target, a Big W to the side of Mildura Central, a 19 aisle Woolworths and a Coles supermarket across the road. Other retailers in Mildura Central include JB Hi-Fi, Kaisercraft, Jay Jays and EB Games.

=== Development proposals ===

Mildura&#x27;s location in Victoria and consistently strong local lobbying have seen the Government of Victoria take an interest in the city as a possible centre for population and industry decentralisation programs. There have been numerous proposals involving the state government for large scale developments and investments, many ambitious and speculative that have been shelved indefinitely.

Given the large amount of sunlight Mildura receives, it is the site for several proposals for large scale solar power in Australia including a massive solar updraft tower proposal in 2004 and 2010. In 2013, Mildura Solar Concentrator Power Station, a 1.5 MW demonstration plant, was commissioned by Silex Systems and it was expected to be expanded to 100 MW by 2017. However, in August 2014, the project was abandoned by Silex, due to lack of commitment to renewable energy by the Abbott government. The government&#x27;s plans to scrap the praised Renewable Energy Target (RET) in Australia were cited as one of the main reasons for abandoning the project. International scientists criticised this decision extensively, claiming Australia risks being &quot;left behind the rest of the world&quot; if it cuts its plans for renewable energy. The decision to not build the plant may also cause electricity prices to rise significantly in the country.

Another large development which has been controversial was the proposal for Mildura to be the site for Victoria&#x27;s second casino.

== Culture ==

Since early settlement Mildura has been home to artists, writers and creative people. Organisations such as the Red Cliffs Musical Society, Eisteddfod, Mildura Ballet Guild and Mildura Country Music Festival have helped grow a reputation for home grown talent and creative community. The hub of this community is the Mildura Arts Centre, which began as a gallery space at Rio Vista House in the 1950s and became fully established in 1956 with the building of a new regional art gallery and performing arts theatre. In 2012, after two years of construction, the new Mildura Arts Centre opened.

Mildura is host to many annual festivals such as the Mildura Country Music Festival, the International Balloon Fiesta, the Jazz Food &amp; Wine Festival, Mildura Wentworth Arts Festival, Murray River International Music Festival, Mildura Writers Festival, Mildura Palimpsest, and the Mildura Show. There is also the annual Mildura masters coarse fishing competition held in November which attracts a number of international and local coarse anglers and the Australian Alternative Varieties Wine Show

== Demographics ==

As of the , there were 34,565 people residing in 15,694 households. Indigenous Australians make up 5.5% of Mildura&#x27;s population. 75.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Malaysia 2.6%, India 1.5%, England 1.3%, Italy 1.0%, and Vietnam 0.9%. 76.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 2.3%, Italian 1.4%, Vietnamese 1.1%, Turkish 1.1% and Punjabi 0.9%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion, so described 41.4%, Catholic 19.1% and Anglican 8.3%.

== Crime ==
In 2018, Mildura recorded the highest rural crime rate in Victoria and the fourth highest crime rate in the state overall.

===Organised Crime===
Mildura has long been associated with the Calabrian Mafia, with claims made by police in 1966 that annual organised crime meetings were held in Mildura to co-ordinate nationwide criminal activities. In a 1960s National Anti-Mafia Directorate report by John T. Cusack (United States&#x27; Bureau of Narcotics) and Ugo Macera (assistant commissioner of police in Calabria) claims were made that the &quot;ancient Calabrian Secret Criminal Society known as the L&#x27;Onorata Societa&quot; and the &quot;&#x27;Ndrangheta&quot; were operating &quot;throughout the State, with large segments in the fruit growing and farming areas of Mildura and Shepparton&quot; adding that &quot;There are reports the Society has existed in Victoria since 1930&quot;. They have reportedly been involved in revenge killings, cannabis production and weapons purchases.

During the 1980s, the Mildura Mafia emerged as a major crime group that dominated marijuana production in Australia and ran an Australia-wide money-laundering network. Several notable mafia murders have been linked to the region including the suspected mafia hit on 43-year-old Marco Medici in 1983, police believe the murder may be connected to the assassination of anti-drug crusader Donald MacKay at Griffith in 1977. The 1984 murders of Melbourne gangsters Rocco Medici and Giuseppe Furina are also connected to Mildura through the Medici family. In 1982, 42-year-old Mildura greengrocer Dominic Marafiote and his parents were murdered after Marafiote gave South Australian police the names of Calabrian mafia bosses in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. In 2016 Mildura residents Nicola Ciconte, Vincenzo Medici and Michael Calleja were convicted and sentenced in Italy for their role in a plot to smuggle up to 500 kilograms of cocaine into Australia.

===Methamphetamine epidemic===

Mildura has recorded significantly higher than average rates of methamphetamine use. Rural methamphetamine use overall is 2.5 times higher than in metropolitan areas. Prior to 2010 rates of use of illicit drugs in rural areas were significantly lower than those in the cities.

In 2014, a Mildura-based Comancheros Motorcycle Club member and former Australian Defence Force (ADF) sniper, Joshua Faulkhead, was arrested after being caught transporting large quantities of methamphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy between Sydney and Mildura. Faulkhead was sentenced to nine years and five months in jail.

In 2015, 20 people were involved in a large drug trafficking operation in Mildura in north-west Victoria. Methamphetamine, marijuana and ecstasy were seized in raids. The drugs seized were reported to be worth more than $15,000. $20,000 in cash were seized and a number of weapons were also seized. Later that same year, Stephen Gillard and Geoffrey Hitchen from South Penrith, were arrested for possession of $300,000 worth of methamphetamines in scrubland off the Mallee Highway at Tutye, west of Ouyen. Local farmers uncovered plastic fruit juice bottles containing the drugs after noticing the men behaving strangely the previous day.

In 2017, a joint Australian Federal Police (AFP) and United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) investigation lead to the seizure of $2.4 million in cash at the Mildura Airport, after 255 kilograms crystal methamphetamine were found at a storage facility in Northern California in June. The bust was part of an investigation into an alleged conspiracy to use a light plane to export drugs from the US to Australia. The 72-year-old pilot, a 52-year-old man from Zetland, and a 58-year-old Melbourne man were charged with conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled drugs and money laundering offences. The crystal methamphetamine was reported to be worth $255 million. Those arrests were connected to $2.4 million which was found in Mildura, in a prime mover that was driven from Adelaide in April.

== Notable people ==
Notable people from Mildura include:
* Leigh Adams, retired motorcycle speedway rider. Ten time Australian Solo Champion and the 1992 World Under-21 Champion. Including juniors, Adams won a total of 16 Australian championships and 4 World Championships.

==Education==

===St Joseph&#x27;s College===

In 1905, a small group of Sisters of Mercy came from Wentworth to Mildura and established a convent in a weatherboard building on the corner of Pine Avenue and Tenth Street.

Catholic secondary education commenced in Mildura in 1906 when the Sisters of Mercy began conducting classes in rooms attached to the original convent in Pine Avenue. The Certificate of Registration of a School, dated 31 December 1906, indicates that sub-primary, primary and secondary classes were being conducted from the convent at the time.

In 1911 boarding school facilities were provided in Olive Avenue and in 1914 a new school was erected in Walnut Avenue. The first buildings of St Joseph&#x27;s College at its present site were opened in 1929. The college has well equipped classrooms, science and computer laboratories, creative arts and design and technology complex, religious education centre, library, sports facilities, staff and student amenities.

===Mildura Senior College===
The college has been closely linked with the development of Mildura since the opening of the irrigation settlement by the Chaffeys in the 1880s. In 1890 the Governor of Victoria, Lord Hopetoun, laid the foundation stone of what was to become the Chaffey Agricultural College but, due to financial difficulties, the college was not built. In 1911, the Education Department of Victoria agreed to erect a high school on the Chaffey College site and Mildura High School was officially opened in September 1912. The diamond jubilee of the school was celebrated on 8 and 9 September 1972. It celebrated its 75th anniversary in August 1987 and in 2012 celebrated its centenary over the weekend of 14–16 September.

As part of a strategic plan by the Ministry of Education in 1990, Mildura High School changed its name to Mildura Secondary College to reflect the changing nature of educational delivery in secondary schools. Again, as a result of restructuring in education provision since 1995, the college has been known as Mildura Senior College, catering exclusively for the final two years of secondary education.

Mildura Senior College caters exclusively for Year 11 &amp; 12 students. In 2013 there will be approximately 500 students in Year 11 and 400 in Year 12. Entrance to Year 11 is open to all students living in the Sunraysia District who have successfully completed Year 10. The decision regarding the satisfactory completion of Year 10 is the responsibility of the 7-10 College. Enrolment at the College is also dependent on factors such as age, behaviour record and other achievements. Please see the section on enrolment for further information.

===Chaffey Secondary College===

Chaffey Secondary College is a Victorian state government secondary school catering for students in Years 7 to 10 located in Deakin Avenue. In 2012 the college had 640 students enrolled. The college offers 120 to 140 different courses each term as part of its modular learning program. Students and families participate in a program of course counselling and student-led presentations each term to help students create the most appropriate course for their ability, pathway and interests. The college has a double-court gymnasium which it operates as a joint-use facility with the Mildura Rural City Council. The college operates a small theatre with seating for up to 220 people.

===Sunraysia Institute of TAFE===
Sunraysia Institute of TAFE&#x27;s main campus is located in Benetook Avenue. In 2008, the institute had 6,592 students enrolled.

===La Trobe University===
La Trobe University operates a regional campus in Mildura, with 500 students enrolled as of 14 February 2018.

==In popular culture==
Two Australian Navy vessels have been named after Mildura, HMAS Mildura and HMS Mildura.

The songs &quot;Mildura (Home of Mine)&quot; and &quot;Come to Mildura – the Land of Winter Sunshine&quot; were written by Reg. Stoneham in the 1920s.

G. H. Ball&#x27;s &quot;My Old Home Town (Mildura)&quot; was recorded on the B-side of John Collinson&#x27;s first recording of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; in 1926.

<doc id="563776" wikidata="Q5434852" url="?curid=563776" title="Faraway Hill">
<text>Faraway Hill was the first soap opera broadcast on an American television network, airing on the DuMont Television Network on Wednesday nights at 9:00 PM between October 2 and December 18, 1946. A &quot;Variety&quot; article stated the Caples advertising agency bought time on DuMont for &quot;experimentation purposes,&quot; and had &quot;walked where other video programmers feared to tread,&quot; moving soap operas from radio to the &quot;infant medium television.&quot;

The series&#x27; plot was based on a novel that David P. Lewis had begun, but never finished.

==Synopsis==
Karen St. John, a wealthy widowed New York City socialite, decides to spend time with her relatives, the Willow family, who live near the small town of Faraway Hill, in Kansas. St. John is attracted to Charlie White who is engaged to her niece, Louise Willow.

The series had an &quot;all-seeing voice&quot; that allowed viewers to know what the characters were thinking. A musical interlude would fade out so the voice could be heard. An example is: &quot;Turn back, turn back, Karen St. John! Something inside you is sounding a warning – This is no place for you...How can you stay? You must leave in the morning…you cannot stay a summer.&quot;

The series ends with the death of Karen St. John, which upset the show&#x27;s four hundred fans.

Jim Von Schilling, in his book, &quot;The Magic Window: American Television, 1939-1953&quot;, wrote, &quot;Soap operas were popular on radio during the 1930s and 1940s; &quot;Faraway Hill&quot; simply brought the genre to television, where real arms were embraced, real tears shed, and where a card reading &#x27;Continued Next Week&#x27; was held before the camera at each episode&#x27;s climax.&quot;

==Cast==
*Flora Campbell as Karen St. John, a wealthy young widow
*Mel Brandt as Charlie White, who is engaged to Louise Willow
*Ann Stell as Louise Willow, St. John&#x27;s niece, and Charlie White&#x27;s fiancé
*Lorene Scott as Mrs. Willow, Louise&#x27;s mother
*Frederic Meyer as Mr. Willow, Louise&#x27;s father

Cast members are listed in &quot;The Early Shows: A Reference Guide to Network and Syndicated Prime Time Television Series from 1944 to 1949&quot;.

==Broadcast history==
The series ran from October 2 to December 18, 1946. David P. Lewis, the writer and director, had a budget of around $300 an episode. The first episode originated from the basement of the Greenwich Village Wanamaker&#x27;s department store.
The half-hour show was broadcast live, although filmed excerpts were interspersed, such as a train sequence in the first episode. Slides of scenes from previous shows were included in later episodes to bring viewers up to date with regard to plot elements which had previously transpired. A narrator gave Karen&#x27;s thoughts as bridges between scenes.

In 1992, Lewis&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; explained the program&#x27;s short lifespan: &quot;Lewis declared at the time that it was only an experiment. It never made a cent and had no commercials. ... He wanted, he said years later, not a successful series but to &#x27;test the mind of the viewer.&#x27;&quot;

==Early commentary==
A review in the October 23, 1946 issue of &quot;Variety&quot; stated that the acting was &quot;done with competence considering the show’s lack of action and more than occasional dull lines.&quot; Cues were too slow, and title cards were held too long, causing poor pacing of events. The reviewer&#x27;s opinion was that &quot;production will have to be jerked up by the bootstraps or Caples’ video director David Lewis’ baby is not long for this world.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In Sharon Travers&#x27; novel &quot;Stranger in Our Midst&quot; (part of The Oak Grove Chronicles series), character Melba reflects on watching &quot;Faraway Hill&quot;:In a dither of confusion,
 she also wondered about watching &quot;Faraway Hill&quot; with Trudy yesterday. It all seemed so real when you actually watched it on television, much more so than listening to it on the radio. They were both caught up in the story, thinking what a sorry mess Karen had gotten herself into.

On February 28, 2006, &quot;Faraway Hill&quot; was featured in a clue on the television game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;. The $200 clue in the category &quot;&#x27;S&#x27;-ential Knowledge&quot; was &quot;Broadcast on the Dumont Network in 1946, &quot;Faraway Hill&quot; is considered the first TV show in this daytime genre&quot;, with the answer being &quot;What is a soap opera&quot;.

==Episode status==
The series was broadcast live, and there are no known recorded episodes.

<text>Tibor George Kalman (July 6, 1949 – May 2, 1999) was an American graphic designer of Hungarian origin, well known for his work as editor-in-chief of &quot;Colors&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Kalman was born on July 6, 1949, in Budapest, to parents Marianne I. (née Deezsoffy or Dezsőffi) and George Tibor Kalman. He became a United States resident in 1956, after he and his family fled Hungary to escape the Soviet invasion, settling in Poughkeepsie, New York. Both of his parents had Jewish ethnic roots and converted to Catholicism to avoid persecution, so &quot;Kalman only became aware that he was Jewish at the age of 18&quot;.

In 1967, he enrolled in New York University (NYU), dropping out after one year of Journalism classes to travel to Cuba to harvest sugar cane and learn about Cuban culture as a member of the Venceremos Brigade.

==Career==
In 1971, Kalman returned to New York City where he was hired by Leonard Riggio for a small bookstore that eventually became Barnes &amp; Noble. He later became the creative director of their in-house design department, where he created advertisements, store signs, shopping bags, and the original B&amp;N bookplate trademark. In 1979, Kalman – along with his wife Maira Kalman, Carol Bokuniewicz, and Liz Trovato – started the design firm M &amp; Co., which did corporate work for such diverse clients as the Limited Corporation, the new wave rock group Talking Heads, and Restaurant Florent in New York City&#x27;s Meatpacking District. He sought to challenge mundane design thinking and aspired to create unpredictable work. Kalman also worked as creative director of &quot;Interview&quot; magazine in the early 1990s.

By the 1980s, Kalman was known for being &quot;the &#x27;bad boy&#x27; of graphic design&quot; because of his antics and radical consciousness. He believed that award-winning design was only possible when the client was ethical, and frequently called other designers out when he did not agree with their actions. He defined good design as a benefit to everyday life and should be used to increase public awareness of social issues. Kalman adopted a vernacular style as a way to protest corporate International Style which was the primary design style of the time.

Kalman became founding editor-in-chief of the Benetton-sponsored magazine &quot;Colors&quot;, in 1991. Two years later, Kalman closed M &amp; Co. and moved to Rome, to work exclusively on &quot;Colors&quot;. Billed as &quot;a magazine about the rest of the world&quot;, &quot;Colors&quot; focused on multiculturalism and global awareness. This perspective was communicated through bold graphic design, typography, and juxtaposition of photographs and doctored images, including a series in which highly recognizable figures such as the Pope and Queen Elizabeth were depicted as racial minorities.

In 1999, Kalman won the AIGA medal as the &quot;design profession&#x27;s moral compass and its most fervent provocateur&quot;.

==Personal life==
From 1981 up until his death, Kalman was married to the illustrator and author Maira Kalman (née Berman). They met while attending NYU. Together they had two children, Lulu Bodoni and Alex Onomatopoeia.

==Death and legacy==
The onset of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma forced Kalman to leave &quot;Colors&quot; in 1995 and return to New York. In 1997, he re-opened M &amp; Co. and continued to work until his death on May 2, 1999, in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico.

==Publications==
*&quot;Tibor Kalman: Perverse Optimist&quot;, a book about Kalman&#x27;s work and that with M&amp;Co, was published by Princeton Architectural Press in 1999. Tibor Kalman (Designer); Peter Hall, Michael Bierut (Editors); Kurt Andersen, Steven Heller, Rick Poynor, Paola Antonelli, David Byrne, Jay Chiat, Jenny Holzer, Isaac Mizrahi, Florent Morellet, Leonard Riggio, Rebecca Robertson, Ingrid Sischy, Elizabeth Sussman, Olivero Toscani (Contributors)

<doc id="563790" wikidata="Q5913364" url="?curid=563790" title="Hour Glass (TV series)">
<text>Hour Glass is the first regularly scheduled variety show shown on American network television. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Television&quot; noted that the program &quot;is historically important because it exemplified the issues faced by networks, sponsors, and advertising agencies in television&#x27;s formative years.&quot;

==Distribution==
&quot;Hour Glass&quot; was broadcast only on WNBT (now WNBC) in New York City from May 9, 1946, through November of that year, when distribution to NBC affiliates in Philadelphia and Schenectady began. From that time, the three-city network continued until March 1947.

==Overview==
Described as &quot;the first [television] hour-long musical variety show&quot;, &quot;Hour Glass&quot; was sponsored by Standard Brands, promoting Chase and Sanborn coffee and Tenderleaf Tea. The program included comedians, musicians, entertaining films (such as a film of dance in South America), and a long, live commercial for the sponsor&#x27;s products.

Such famous names as Doodles Weaver, Bert Lahr, Dennis Day, Anton Reiter, Jerry Colonna, Peggy Lee and Joe Besser appeared on the program. The first show was hosted by Evelyn Eaton (daughter of one of The Seven Little Eatons); &quot;Life&quot; surmised that NBC was adapting to a paradigm shift and making better use of the visual medium by hiring an attractive woman as master of ceremonies, as opposed to the more authoritative voices of men who typically commanded radio variety shows of the era.

On November 14, 1946, Edgar Bergen brought his ventriloquism act to the show. It was one of the first times that a major radio performer had appeared on television. Coincidentally, Standard Brands (via Chase and Sanborn) was the sponsor of Bergen&#x27;s radio program.

==Duration==
&quot;The Columbia History of American Television&quot; attributed the program&#x27;s short life to its cost and the lack of market penetration for television at the time, saying, &quot;Standard Brands invested $200,000 in this series over its ten-month tenure at a time when that level of investment just couldn&#x27;t be supported and sustained, leading to the &quot;Hour Glass&quot;&#x27;s abbreviated run.&quot; Another factor was that James Petrillo, president of the American Federation of Musicians forbade musicians from performing on television without an agreement between the AFM and the networks, thus limiting directors and performers to use of recorded music and lip sync. A report in &quot;Life&quot; at the show&#x27;s start noted that the show&#x27;s audience at the time was estimated at 3,500 television sets watched by up to 20,000 viewers, a thousandth of the estimated 20,000,000 radio listeners nationwide that were hearing &quot;The Chase and Sanborn Hour&quot; in a given week.

==Personnel==
The show was co-hosted by Eddie Mayehoff and Helen Parrish. Bergen later became the host of the program. Edward Sobol was the producer. During the series&#x27; time on the air, a system of alternating writers was developed, giving &quot;an individual writer two weeks in which to write a show instead of the weekly deadline.&quot;

==Critical reception==
A contemporary review in &quot;Life&quot; praised the individual performances but panned the production values, noting that camera operators cut off the feet of dancers and that the show lacked the kind of &quot;camera virtuosity monopolized by Hollywood.&quot; On the whole, the &quot;Life&quot; review noted that television would need &quot;good scripts and better directors&quot; if it were to succeed.

==Existing recordings==
Audio-only recordings of &quot;Hour Glass&quot; from 1946–1947, including the inaugural show, are known to exist at the Library of Congress, making the show one of the few shows to have any surviving material from before 1948 still in existence. Photos of the first live &quot;Hour Glass&quot; broadcast taken from a TV monitor during the live telecast, along with a program review, appear in the May 27, 1946 issue of &quot;Life&quot;.

<text>Canvey Island Football Club is a football club based in Canvey Island, Essex, England. They are currently members of the and play at Park Lane.

==History==
The club was established in 1926 and initially played in the Southend &amp; District League. They later joined the Thurrock Combination, winning the League Cup in 1952–53 and the league and League Cup double in 1955–56. In 1957 the club joined the Parthenon League, finishing bottom of the league in their first season. The following season saw them finish sixth and win the League Cup, and in 1959–60 they were league runners-up. In 1963 they switched to the London League, joining the reformed Division One. In 1964 the league merged with the Aetolian League to form the Greater London League, with the club placed in the A division. In 1967–68 they were Division One champions and won the League Cup, retaining both titles the following season.

In 1971 the Greater London League merged with the Metropolitan League to form the Metropolitan–London League, with Canvey Island placed in Division One. When the league merged with the Spartan League in 1975 they joined the Essex Senior League. They were runners-up in 1978–79 and won the League Cup the following season. They won the league for the first time in 1986–87. After winning the league and League Cup again under Jeff King in 1992–93, a season which also saw the club reach the semi-finals of the FA Vase, they moved up to Division Three of the Isthmian League in 1994. Their first season in Division Three saw them finish as runners-up, earning promotion to Division Two. The club went on to win Division Two the following season, resulting in promotion to Division One. They also reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, eventually losing 4–1 to Brighton in a replay.

Although Canvey Island were relegated back to Division Two at the end of the 1996–97 season, they were Division Two champions in 1997–98 and Division One champions in 1998–99 as successive promotions saw them reach the league&#x27;s Premier Division. In 2000–01 they finished as league runners-up, and also reached the second round of the FA Cup; the first round saw them beat Second Division Port Vale 2–1 in a replay at Vale Park after a 4–4 draw at Park Lane. In the second round the club were drawn at home to near-neighbours Third Division Southend United; in a game switched to Southend&#x27;s Roots Hall, they lost 2–1. However, the club&#x27;s biggest success came in the FA Trophy, where they reached the final at Villa Park after beating three teams from the Football Conference. In the final the club beat favourites Forest Green Rovers 1–0, becoming the first team from the Isthmian League to win the competition for 20 years. The following season saw them finish as Premier Division runners-up again, as well as reaching the third round of the FA Cup. After winning 1–0 against Football League clubs Wigan Athletic and Northampton Town in both the first and second round, they lost 4–1 at Burnley in the third round.

In 2002–03 Canvey Island finished as Premier Division runners-up for a third consecutive season, but the following year saw them win the division to earn promotion to the Conference National. The season had also seen them reach the FA Cup first round for a third time; again drawn to face Southend, they lost 3–2 in a replay at Park Lane after a 1–1 draw at Roots Hall and the FA Trophy final, where they lost 3–2 to Hednesford Town. Another first round appearance in 2004–05 ended in a 4–0 defeat to Aldershot Town. After two seasons at the fifth level, King decided the poor attendances did not justify continued investment in the club and they took voluntary demotion to Division One North of the Isthmian League. In 2007–08 they finished fifth in the division, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After defeating AFC Sudbury 3–2 in the semi-finals, they beat Redbridge 5–4 on penalties in the final after the match had ended 1–1 and were promoted back to the Premier Division.

Canvey Island were relegated back to the (renamed) North Division at the end of the 2016–17 season after finishing third-from-bottom of the Premier Division. The following season saw them finish sixth in the North Division, qualifying for the play-offs. After beating Bowers &amp; Pitsea 2–0 in the semi-finals, they lost 3–1 to Haringey Borough in the final. In 2020–21 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup again, winning 2–1 at Banbury United, before losing 3–0 to Boreham Wood in the second round. The 2021–22 season saw the club finish as runners-up in the North Division, going on to beat Felixstowe &amp; Walton United 3–1 in the play-off semi-finals before winning the final against Brentwood Town 4–1 on penalties, earning promotion to the Premier Division. The club finished third in the Premier Division the following season before being beaten by Aveley in the play-off semi-finals.

==Ground==
Upon formation, the club played at The Paddocks on Long Road on the island, before moving to Furtherwick School. Following World War II, Canvey Island returned to The Paddocks. In 1955, the club moved a short distance to Poplar Road. Whilst in the Parthenon League, the club moved to Park Lane in 1962. It currently has a capacity of 4,100, of which 500 is seated and 827 covered. In the summer of 2018, it was announced that the club would also be hosting the home matches of Benfleet.

<text>Arna () is a village on the eastern slopes of the Taygetus mountain range, at an altitude of .

Located in Laconia, in the Peloponnese, it used to form part of the municipal unit of Faris until 31 December 2010. Since 1 January 2011, as part of the Kallikratis reform, it has been one of the local communities of the municipality of Sparta.

The nearest major towns are Gytheio, to the southeast, and Sparta, approximately 40 km to the north.

The area has a rich history. Near the village, at the Arkina site, two Mycenaean-era chamber tombs have been found. Artefacts from many periods have also been found at Arna and Arkina, mostly ceramic containers. These findings support the conclusion that the site has been, since ancient times, a stop on the road connecting Sparta and Messenia.

The residents of Arna featured prominently in the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829). A close-by reminder of that struggle is the &quot;Kolokotronis Cave&quot;, on the north slope of Mt. Annina. Folk tradition has it that Constantine Kolokotronis (father of famed hero Theodoros Kolokotronis) sought refuge in this cave after being wounded defending the tower of the nearby village of Kastania, at the side of fellow revolutionary Panagiotaros Venetsanakos, a Maniot from Mesa Mani. He was discovered there the next day and killed; his body was thrown into the cave.

Today, Arna&#x27;s population is on the decline, as is the population of the Greek countryside nationwide. The 1971 census counted 324 residents in the village; today, fewer than 150 remain. There are, however, positive signs of increased activity: the number of visits from emigrant Arniotes is on the rise year-round.

<text>The Lingones (Gaulish: &#x27;the jumpers&#x27;) were a Gallic tribe of the Iron Age and Roman periods. They dwelled in the region surrounding the present-day city of Langres, between the provinces of Gallia Lugdunensis and Gallia Belgica.

== Name ==

=== Attestations ===
They are mentioned as &quot;Língōnes&quot; (Λίγγωνες) by Polybius (2nd c. BC), &quot;Lingones&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC), Pliny (1st c. AD) and Tacitus (early 2nd c. AD), &quot;Díngones&quot; (Δίγγονες) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), and as &quot;Lóngōnes&quot; (Λόγγωνες) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).

=== Etymology ===
The Gaulish ethnonym &quot;Lingones&quot; literally means &#x27;the jumpers&#x27;. It derives from the stem &quot;ling-&quot; (&#x27;to jump&#x27;), itself from the Proto-Celtic verbal base &quot;*leng-&quot; (&#x27;to jump&#x27;; cf. Old Irish &quot;lingid&quot; &#x27;he jumps&#x27;), extended by the suffix -&quot;on-es&quot;. The name could be interpreted as &#x27;good at jumping (on horseback)&#x27;, or else as &#x27;the dancers&#x27;.

The city of Langres, attested ca. 400 AD as &quot;civitas Lingonum&quot;, is named after the Gallic tribe.

== Geography ==
The territory of the Lingones was situated on the border separating Gallia Lugdunensis from Gallia Belgica, between the Senones and the Sequani.

=== Settlement ===
Their capital Andematunnum (present-day Langres, Haute-Marne) is attested from 43 AD on boundary markers (abbreviated as &quot;AND&quot;). It was built on a Bajocian limestone promontory, overlooking the Marne valley to the east and north, and the Bonnelle valley to the west. Only the southern part, open to the Langres plateau, did not possess natural defences. Archeological evidence have demonstrated a continuity between the La Tène and Roman periods on the site of Langres, and the city of Andematunnum appears to have been built at the turn of the 1st century BC on a previous Gallic settlement. The Roman-era civitas of the Lingones was located at the crossroad of the modern départments of Aube, Haute-Marne, Côte d’Or and Yonne.

The Cathedral St-Mammes, built in the Burgundian Romanesque style for the ancient diocese that was referred to as &quot;Lingonae&quot; (&quot;of the Lingones&quot;) and rivalled Dijon. Three of its early bishops were martyred by the invasion of the Vandals, about 407.

== History ==
Some of the Lingones migrated across the Alps and settled near the mouth of the Po River in Cisalpine Gaul of northern Italy around 400 BC. These Lingones were part of a wave of Celtic tribes that included the Boii and Senones (Polybius, &quot;Histories&quot; ii.17). The Lingones may have helped sack Rome in 390 BC.

The Gaulish Lingones did not participate in the battles of the Gauls against Caesar. They gained Roman citizenship at the end of the first century AD. They were caught up in the Batavian rebellion (69 AD) described by Tacitus.

The strategist Sextus Julius Frontinus, author of the &quot;Strategemata&quot;, the earliest surviving Roman military textbook, mentions the Lingones among his examples of successful military tactics:
In Roman Britain, at least three named cohorts of Lingones, probably subscripted from among the Lingones who had remained in the area of Langres and Dijon are attested in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, from dedicatory inscriptions and stamped tiles. The 1st cohort of Lingones (part-mounted) is attested at &quot;Bremenium&quot;, the Roman fort at High Rochester in north Northumberland, the 2nd cohort of Lingones is attested at Ilkley Roman Fort by their Prefect, and the fourth cohort built part of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall near Carlisle.

== Religion ==
During the Roman period, Mars Cicolluis was the main god of the Lingones.

<text>The Osborne Vixen is a &quot;luggable&quot; portable computer announced by the Osborne Computer Corporation in November 1984, as a follow-up to their Osborne 1 and Osborne Executive system. 

The Vixen has a 4 MHz Zilog Z80 microprocessor with 64 KB dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) and 4 KB EPROM. It has a 7-inch diagonal amber display that can show 24 lines by 80 columns of memory mapped video. It uses two 400 KB disk drives, utilizing double-density double-sided 5.25&quot; diskettes. As a luggable, it weighs about 18 pounds. Contemporary advertising pointed out that it could fit under the seat in an airplane, with dimensions of 12 by 16 by 6 inches (321 by 413 by 159 mm).

When it was released, the Vixen had a retail price of $1298. Customers also had the option of purchasing an external 10 megabyte hard disk for $1495.

The Vixen used version 2.2 of the CP/M operating system. It was also bundled with a number of software packages: &quot;WordStar&quot;, the popular word processing package; &quot;SuperCalc&quot;, a spreadsheet; &quot;MBASIC&quot;, a programming language; &quot;Osboard&quot;, a graphics and drawing program; &quot;TurnKey&quot;, a system utility; &quot;Media Master&quot;, a data interchange program that allowed compatibility with over &quot;200 other computers&quot;; and &quot;Desolation&quot;, a game.

The Vixen was also known as the Osborne 4. It was developed and released after the bankruptcy of the Osborne Computer Corporation. An earlier system also called &quot;Vixen&quot; was never released. Due to technical problems with prototypes and the corporate bankruptcy, by the time the CP/M Vixen was introduced, it had already been made obsolete by MS-DOS IBM PC compatibles. A last ditch effort to design and market a fully IBM PC compatible produced three prototypes, but too late to save the company from bankruptcy.

<text>The movements of the Southern Dragon style (traditional name Lung Ying &quot;Dragon Form&quot;; ) of Shaolin Boxing are based on the mythical Chinese dragon. The Dragon style is an imitative-style that was developed based on the imagined characteristics of the mythical Chinese dragon.

==History==
The history of the Southern Dragon style has historically been transmitted orally rather than by text, so its origins will likely never be known in their entirety. Modern Southern Dragon style&#x27;s history can be reliably traced to the monk Daai Yuk Sim Si, who was the abbot of Huashoutai (White Hair) temple on Mount Luofu. No reliable records of the style&#x27;s origin prior to Daai exist, though there is much speculation regarding the subject.

Southern Dragon style has its roots in a combination of the local styles of the Hakka heartland in inland eastern Guangdong, and the style that the monk Ji Sin Sim Si taught in Guangdong and the neighboring province of Fujian in the 18th century.

North of the Dongjiang, in the northwest of Boluo County in the prefecture of Huizhou in Guangdong Province, is the sacred mountain Luofushan. Luofushan is the site of many temples, including Huashoutai where, c. 1900, a Chan (Zen) master named Daai Yuk taught Southern Dragon style to Lam Yiu Gwai (1874–1965), who in turn passed the art on to the many students of his schools in Guangzhou.

Lam Yiu Gwai and Jeung Lai Chuen (1880-1966) were good friends from their youth in the Dongjiang region of Huizhou, longtime training partners and later cousins by marriage. Lam and Jeung would open several schools together, and Southern Dragon style and Jeung&#x27;s style of Bak Mei would go on to share many similarities.

A variation of the Southern Dragon style is taught by the Long Choo Kung Fu Society based in Penang, Malaysia, and with branches in Australia. Founded by Li Ah Yu and his father near the turn of the 20th century, this association claims it is teaching a Soft/Hard Dragon style originating from Fujian province.

==Methods and philosophy==
 
Southern Dragons kung fu is essentially an internal &quot;qi&quot; cultivation method, but initialization training produces closer results to that of a hard, external style than the delicate approach an internal (like tai chi or &quot;baguazhang&quot;) would. In learning the moves of the style, the student will strike hard, block hard and rush into each position, with the idea of learning the proper place to be once each movement is complete. Eventually, the method of transmitting power is retained, and the physically strengthened body is able to make transitions in the proper, fluid manner. In turn, this dragon-like smoothness helps disguise the attack, making it extremely difficult for an adversary to effectively counter.

Once a purely physical semblance to flow has been mastered, the disciple incorporates the deep hissing sounds associated with the style to train chi flow. Inhaling is silent, but exhalation is deliberate, tense, and controlled. Inhaling lightens the body for aerial maneuvers, while exhaling drives power into each technique. Blocking is dispensed with, and parries or simple strikes substituted. At this point, novice and advanced student show very little in common.

On the highest level, an opponent is allowed to tire himself out, with evasion becoming the Dragon&#x27;s key defense. &quot;Qi&quot; control is highly developed, and the degree to which the body must be moved to redirect or avoid impact is under greater control.

The forms (&quot;Taolu&quot;; 套路) that constitute this system are divided by complexity into three categories, and are enumerated below:

*Basic
**16 Movements/Holes ()
**Passing Bridge Three Times ()
**Fierce Tiger Leaping Over Wall ()
**Rescue Master From Single Side ()
**Single Sword and Mount ()
**Press and Hit from Four Sides ()
**Eagle Claw ()
**Bridge Smashing ()
*Intermediate
**Touch Bridge (introduces sticking hands) ()
**Venomous Snake Moves Tongue ()
**Hua King&#x27;s Fist ()
**Standing Five-Form ()
**Cross Standing Five-Form
**Turn to Hook and Hit
**Five Horses Returning to Stable ()
*Advanced
**Plum Flower Punch ()
**Seven Ways of Plum Flower Punch ()

In each form, one is taught to &quot;ride the wind&quot;, a phrase which in large part means follow rather than lead. Provide no opening without first letting your opponent open. Unlike the Crane style, which also relies heavily upon evasion as a tactic, the Dragon style evades primarily by rotation of upper or lower torso with straight and zig-zag stance movements, while the Crane stylist hops frequently to reposition the entire body. Both styles employ pinpoint strikes to vulnerable meridian targets, but the Dragon style also heavily uses tiger-like punches and clawing techniques, snake-like stance shifts, and leopard-like hit and run strikes to weaken a physically superior adversary. Southern Dragon kung fu also regularly employs low sweeping techniques, but these are not unique. Most senior stylists of any kung fu system use these on a weakened adversary.

==Dragon style in popular culture==

*The 2010 show &quot;A Fistful of Stances&quot; has used the Dragon style in episodes 22 and 23.
*The style was performed by Jackie Chan in his films &quot;Dragon Lord&quot; and &quot;Dragon Fist&quot;.
*The Dragon style is one of the three fighting styles utilized by the character Sub-Zero in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series (as seen in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;) and the character Jarek in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;. It is also Liu Kang&#x27;s grapple style in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot;. Onaga, the boss character of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, also uses a fighting style named Dragon.
*The Dragon fighting style is used at times by the police officer Lei Wulong in &quot;Tekken&quot;.
* &quot;Southern Dragon kung fu&quot; inspired some firebending techniques on the 2005–2008 Nickelodeon Animation Studio TV series &quot;&quot;, M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s 2010 film counterpart, its , and its sequel series &quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;.
* &quot;Southern Dragon&quot; was among the fighting styles used by Batman and Catwoman on the DC Comics franchises.
*Kazuma Kiryu the protagonist of the Yakuza (franchise) series uses a fighting style called &#x27;Dragon Style&#x27; although this is not the same martial art

<text>The Illinois River is a tributary of the Arkansas River in the U.S. states of Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Osage Indians named it &quot;Ne-eng-wah-kon-dah&quot;, which translates as &quot;Medicine Stone River&quot;. The state of Oklahoma has designated its portion as a Scenic River.

==History==
An unidentified French explorer called this body of water &quot;rivière des Illinois&quot; after the Illinois Indians who were not, however, usually present in this area. Rather, the earliest known inhabitants were descendants of Caddoans who built the Spiro Mounds at Spiro, Oklahoma. In the 18th century, the Illinois River country was a hunting ground for the Osage Indians. Cherokee began to migrate into the area about 1800. U. S. Army Major James Wilkinson reported passing the mouth of this river in 1806. In 1828, the river was designated as a main waterway for the Cherokees

The Illinois Confederation included the Peoria, Miami, Wei and Kaskaskia tribes. These tribes shared similar language culture and customs and were all classified as Algonquin. The Miami word &quot;Ilaniawaki&quot;, meaning &quot;real or original ones,&quot; became the French term &quot;Illinois&quot;.

Lake Tenkiller, created by damming the Illinois River beginning in 1947 with completion in 1953, has attracted tourists and fishermen to this once sparsely settled area. Seventy miles of the river between Lake Tenkiller and the Arkansas border, flowing through the Cookson Hills, have been supervised by the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Commission, currently headed by Ed Fite since 1970.

==Description==
The spring-fed river rises in the Ozark Mountains in the northwest corner of Arkansas, in Washington County southwest of Fayetteville, near the communities of Hogeye and Onda. The stream flows north parallel to Arkansas Highway 265 then turns northwest passing under U.S. Route 62 northeast of Prairie Grove. It continues north-northwest passing under Arkansas Highway 16 west of Savoy and forming a portion of the east boundary of the Ozark–St. Francis National Forest. The stream flows through a portion of the national forest and enters Benton County. Near Robinson the stream flows under U.S. Route 412 and turns to the west paralleling that route. It passes north of Pedro then under Route 412 again and turns to the southwest. It passes under Arkansas 16 again and Arkansas Highway 59 to the southeast of Siloam Springs. The stream leaves Arkansas at the southwest corner of Benton County and enters Lake Frances in Oklahoma.

It flows west into northeast Oklahoma, then southwest and south through the mountains of eastern Oklahoma, past Sparrowhawk and Tahlequah. South of Tahlequah, it passes through the reservoir Tenkiller Ferry Lake. It joins the Arkansas River downstream of Gore and upstream of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, approximately southeast of Muskogee. Together with its tributary streams, it has a drainage area of . The town of Tahlequah on its banks was the western terminus of the Trail of Tears.
The river is a major source of tourism in the area. In 1999, it was estimated to have brought in approximately 500,000 tourists and $9 million to the Oklahoma section of the river.

The upper section and its tributaries, Flint Creek and the Baron Fork, became a designated Scenic River under the Oklahoma Scenic Rivers Act in 1977. and home to many native species of bass with spring runs of white bass. It is a popular summertime destination for floaters. The lower section, below Tenkiller Dam, is a designated year-round trout stream, stocked with Rainbow and Brown Trout. The state record rainbow trout was caught in the cold tailwater of the dam.

==Tributaries==
Major tributaries of the Illinois River include: 
*Muddy Fork (L), 
*Clear Creek (R), 
*Osage Creek (R), 
*Cincinnati Creek (L), 
*Beaver Creek (R), 
*Tate Parris Branch (L), 
*Rock Branch (L), 
*Dripping Springs Branch (R), 
*Flint Creek (R),
*Blue Springs Branch (R), 
*Luna Branch (L), 
*Fall Branch (L), 
*Falls Branch (R), 
*Tahlequa Creek (R), 
*Baron Fork (L), 
*Park Hill Branch (R), 

-at which point it flows into Tenkiller Ferry Lake. Below Tenkiller Ferry Lake are

*Red Bird Smith Creek (L)
*LaRue Branch (L), 
*Deep Branch (L), 
*Salt Branch (L)

==Nature preserve==
The J. T. Nickel Family Nature and Wildlife Preserve is the largest nature preserve near the river. It is located near the east bank of the Illinois River near Tahlequah, Oklahoma. Elk were reintroduced into the preserve in 2005. This species had been missing from the Cookson Hills area for at least 150 years.

==Environmental issues==
The river has been the source of a long-running controversy between the two states, with Oklahoma blaming Arkansas for pollution in the river, most notoriously phosphorus contamination by sewage and poultry farm runoff. In 1987, wastewater discharge by the city of Fayetteville, Arkansas was identified as the source of a heavy load of phosphorus. Oklahoma sued Arkansas to stop this discharge. The suit went to the U. S. Supreme Court in 1992, which ruled that the upstream state must enforce the water quality rules of the downstream state. In 2002, Oklahoma became the first state to use a numerical water quality standard for phosphorus. The standard for scenic rivers was set at 0.037 mg/L In December 2003, an agreement was reached between the two states, with Arkansas agreeing to reduce phosphorus output from its waste water treatment plants by 75% over the next ten years, although it does not address poultry-farm runoff.

In 1996, a report demonstrated that nutrient-fed algae was endangering Lake Tenkiller, which is located on the lower Illinois. The report stated that phosphorus content in the river should be reduced by 40 percent to prevent lake water quality from declining further and by 80 percent to return the quality to its original condition.

In the early 2000s, the Illinois River had high levels of pollution due largely to water runoff contaminated by chicken manure. In 2006, the state of Oklahoma began the process of suing a number of firms, including Tyson Foods Inc. because the chicken waste spread on fields near the river contains chemicals that were injurious to the ecosystem, hence jeopardizing the region&#x27;s tourist industry. One lawyer involved in the prosecution said: &quot;They&#x27;re not fertilizing, they&#x27;re dumping.&quot; By 2009, the river&#x27;s condition was described as being visibly better, following the removal of nearly 290,000 tons of chicken waste from the catchment in the intervening four years. 

The Oklahoma Water Resources Board reported in 2015, that phosphorus levels had been declining in the Illinois River and its tributaries on the Oklahoma side of the state line. On October 1, 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) issued for public comment the water quality model for the Illinois River.

The Oklahoma lawsuit named 11 companies, including: Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.; Tyson Poultry Inc.; Tyson Chicken Inc.; Cobb-Vantress Inc. (another subsidiary of Tyson); Cargill Turkey Production L.L.C.; George&#x27;s Inc.; George&#x27;s Farms Inc.; Peterson Farms Inc. and Simmons Foods Inc. A ruling in January 2023 gave the companies two months to explain how they will remedy the situation.

==In popular culture==
The Illinois River is a significant location in the 1961 Wilson Rawls novel, &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows&quot;.

<text>Clara Mary Jane Clairmont (27 April 1798 – 19 March 1879), or Claire Clairmont as she was commonly known, was the stepsister of English writer Mary Shelley and the mother of Lord Byron&#x27;s daughter Allegra. She is thought to be the subject of a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

==Early life==
Clairmont was born in 1798 in Brislington, near Bristol, England, the second child and only daughter of Mary Jane Vial Clairmont. Throughout her childhood, she was known as Jane. In 2010 the identity of her father was discovered to be John Lethbridge (1746–1815, after 1804 Sir John Lethbridge, 1st Baronet) of Sandhill Park, near Taunton in Somerset. Her mother had identified him as a &quot;Charles Clairmont&quot;, adopting the name Clairmont for herself and her children to disguise their illegitimacy. It appears that the father of her first child, Charles, was Charles Abram Marc Gaulis, &quot;a merchant and member of a prominent Swiss family, whom she met in Cadiz&quot;.

In December 1801, when Clairmont was three years old, her mother married a neighbour, the writer and philosopher William Godwin. This brought her two stepsisters: Godwin&#x27;s daughter, later Mary Shelley, only eight months her senior, and his stepdaughter Fanny Imlay, a couple of years older. Both were the daughters of Mary Wollstonecraft, who had died four years before, but whose presence continued to be felt in the household. The new couple soon became the parents of a son, which completed the family.

All five children were influenced by Godwin&#x27;s radical anarchist philosophical beliefs. Both parents were well-educated and they co-wrote children&#x27;s primers on Biblical and classical history, and ran a bookshop and publishers known as the Juvenile Library. Godwin encouraged all of his children to read widely and give lectures from early childhood.

Mary Jane Clairmont was a sharp-tongued woman, who often quarrelled with Godwin and favoured her own children over her husband&#x27;s. She contrived to send her volatile and emotionally intense daughter to boarding school for a time, so providing her with more formal education than her stepsisters. Unlike Mary, Claire Clairmont was fluent in French as a teenager and was later credited with fluency in five languages. Despite their different treatment, the girls grew close and remained in contact for the rest of their lives.

== Travels through Europe with the Shelleys ==
At 16, Clairmont was a lively brunette with a good singing voice and a hunger for recognition. Her home life had become increasingly tense as her stepfather William Godwin sank deeper into debt and her mother&#x27;s relations with Godwin&#x27;s daughter Mary became more strained. Clairmont aided her stepsister&#x27;s clandestine meetings with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who had professed a belief in free love and soon left his own wife, Harriet, and two small children to be with Mary. When Mary ran away with Shelley in July 1814, Clairmont went with them. Clairmont&#x27;s mother traced the group to an inn in Calais, but could not make Clairmont go home with her. Godwin needed the financial assistance that the aristocratic Shelley could provide.

Clairmont remained in the Shelley household in their wanderings across Europe. The three young people traipsed across war-torn France and into Switzerland, fancying themselves as characters in a romantic novel, as Mary Shelley later recalled, but always reading widely, writing, and discussing the creative process. On the journey, Clairmont read Rousseau, Shakespeare and the works of Mary&#x27;s mother, Mary Wollstonecraft. &quot;What shall poor Cordelia do – Love &amp; be silent&quot;, Clairmont wrote in her journal while reading &quot;King Lear&quot;. &quot;Oh [th]is is true – Real Love will never [sh]ew itself to the eye of broad day – it courts the secret glades.&quot; Clairmont&#x27;s emotions were so stirred by Cordelia that she had one of her &quot;horrors&quot;, a hysterical fit, Mary Shelley recorded in her own journal entry for the same day. Clairmont, who was surrounded by poets and writers, also made her own literary attempts. During the summer of 1814, she started a story titled &quot;The Idiot&quot;, which has since been lost. In 1817–1818, she wrote a book, which Percy Bysshe Shelley tried without success to have published. Although Clairmont lacked the literary talent of her stepsister and brother-in-law, she always longed to take centre stage. It was during this period that she changed her name from &quot;Jane&quot;, first to &quot;Clara&quot; and finally to the more romantic-sounding &quot;Claire&quot;.

=== Relationship with Lord Byron ===

Any romantic designs Clairmont might have had on Shelley were frustrated initially, but she did bring the Shelleys into contact with Lord Byron, with whom she entered into an affair before he left England in 1816 to live abroad. (A year marked by agricultural failures and widespread European famine, but also of significant literary advances as the Godwin-Shelley-Byron circle holed up indoors, 1816 would later be known as the &quot;year without a summer&quot;.) Clairmont hoped to become a writer or an actress and wrote to Byron asking for &quot;career advice&quot; in March 1816, when she was almost 18. Byron was a director at the Drury Lane Theatre. Clairmont later followed up her letters with visits, sometimes bringing Mary, whom she seemed to suggest Byron might also find attractive. &quot;Do you know I cannot talk to you when I see you? I am so awkward and only feel inclined to take a little stool and sit at your feet&quot;, Clairmont wrote to Byron. She &quot;bombarded him with passionate daily communiqués&quot;, telling him he need only accept &quot;that which it has long been the passionate wish of my heart to give you.&quot; She arranged for them to meet at a country inn. Byron, in a depressed state after the breakup of his marriage to Annabella Milbanke and the scandal over his relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, made it very clear to Clairmont before he left that she would not be a part of his life, but she remained determined to change his mind.

She convinced Mary and Percy Shelley that they should follow Byron to Switzerland, where they met him and his personal physician, John William Polidori, at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva. It is unknown whether Clairmont knew she was pregnant with Byron&#x27;s child at the commencement of the trip, but it soon became apparent to both her travelling companions and to Byron not long after their arrival at his door. At first he maintained his refusal of Clairmont&#x27;s companionship and allowed her to be in his presence only in the company of the Shelleys; later, they resumed their sexual relationship for a time in Switzerland. Clairmont and Mary also made fair copies of Byron&#x27;s current work-in-progress, &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;.

Clairmont was the only lover, other than Caroline Lamb, whom Byron referred to as a &quot;little fiend&quot;. Confessing the affair in a letter to his half-sister Augusta Leigh, Byron wrote:

He referred to her also in a letter to Douglas Kinnaird (20 January 1817):

Clairmont would later say that her relationship with Byron had given her only a few minutes of pleasure, but a lifetime of trouble.

=== Allegra ===
The group left Byron in Switzerland at the end of the summer and returned to England. Clairmont took up residence in Bath and in January 1817 she gave birth to a daughter, Alba, whose name was eventually changed to Allegra. Throughout the pregnancy, Clairmont had written long letters to Byron, pleading for his attention and a promise to care for her and the baby, sometimes making fun of his friends, reminding him how much he had enjoyed making love to her, and sometimes threatening suicide. Byron, who by this time hated her, ignored the letters. The following year, Clairmont and the Shelleys left England and journeyed once more to Byron, who now resided in Italy. Clairmont felt that the future Byron could provide for their daughter would be greater than any she herself would be able to grant the child and therefore, wished to deliver Allegra into his care.

Upon arriving in Italy, Clairmont was again refused by Byron. He arranged to have Allegra delivered to his house in Venice and agreed to raise the child on the condition that Clairmont keep her distance from him. Clairmont reluctantly gave Allegra over to Byron.
Clairmont was granted only a few brief visits with her daughter after surrendering her to Byron. When Byron arranged to place her in a Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, Italy, Clairmont was outraged. In 1821, she wrote Byron a letter accusing him of breaking his promise that their daughter would never be apart from one of her parents. She felt that the physical conditions in convents were unhealthy and the education provided was poor and was responsible for &quot;the state of ignorance &amp; profligacy of Italian women, all pupils of Convents. They are bad wives &amp; most unnatural mothers, licentious &amp; ignorant they are the dishonour &amp; unhappiness of society... This step will procure to you an innumerable addition of enemies &amp; of blame.&quot;

By March 1822, it had been two years since she had seen her daughter. She plotted to kidnap Allegra from the convent and asked Shelley to forge a letter of permission from Byron. Shelley refused her request. Byron&#x27;s seemingly callous treatment of the child was further vilified when Allegra died there at the age of five, from a fever some scholars identify as typhus and others speculate was a malarial-type fever. Clairmont held Byron entirely responsible for the loss of their daughter and hated him for the rest of her life. Shelley&#x27;s death followed only two months later.

=== Relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley ===

Clairmont may have been sexually involved with Percy Bysshe Shelley at various periods, though Clairmont&#x27;s biographers, Gittings and Manton, find no hard evidence. Their friend Thomas Jefferson Hogg joked about &quot;Shelley and his two wives&quot;, Mary and Claire, a remark that Clairmont recorded in her own journal. Clairmont was also entirely in sympathy, more so than Mary, with Shelley&#x27;s theories about free love, communal living, and the right of a woman to choose her own lovers and initiate sexual contact outside marriage. She seemed to conceive of love as a &quot;triangle&quot; and enjoyed being the third. She had also formed a close friendship with Shelley, who called her &quot;my sweet child&quot;, and she both inspired and fed off his work.

Mary Shelley&#x27;s early journals record several times when Clairmont and Shelley shared visions of Gothic horror and let their imaginings take flight, stirring each other&#x27;s emotions to the point of hysteria and nightmares. In October 1814, Shelley deliberately frightened Clairmont by assuming a particularly sinister and horrifying facial expression. &quot;How horribly you look... Take your eyes off!&quot; she cried. She was put to bed after yet another of her &quot;horrors&quot;. Shelley described her expression to Mary as &quot;distorted most unnaturally by horrible dismay&quot;. In the autumn of 1814, Clairmont and Shelley also discussed forming &quot;an association of philosophical people&quot; and Clairmont&#x27;s conception of an idealized community in which women were the ones in charge.

Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;To Constantia, Singing&quot; is thought to be about her:

Mary Shelley revised this poem, completely altering the first two stanzas, when she included it in a posthumous collection of Shelley&#x27;s works published in 1824. In Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Epipsychidion&quot;, some scholars believe that he is addressing Clairmont as his:

At the time Shelley wrote the poem, in Pisa, Clairmont was living in Florence, and the lines may reveal how much he missed her.

 It has occasionally been suggested that Clairmont was also the mother of a daughter fathered by Percy Shelley. The possibility goes back to the accusation by Shelley&#x27;s servants, Elise and Paolo Foggi, that Clairmont gave birth to Shelley&#x27;s baby during a stay in Naples, where on 27 February 1819, Shelley registered a baby named Elena Adelaide Shelley as having been born on 27 December 1818. The registrar recorded her as the daughter of Percy Shelley and &quot;Maria&quot; or &quot;Marina Padurin&quot; (possibly an Italian mispronunciation of &quot;Mary Godwin&quot;), and she was baptized the same day as the lawfully begotten child of Percy Shelley and Mary Godwin. It is, however, almost impossible that Mary Shelley was the mother, and this has given rise to several theories, including that the child was indeed Clairmont&#x27;s. Clairmont herself had ascended Mount Vesuvius, carried on a palanquin, on 16 December 1818, only nine days before the date given for the birth of Elena. It may be significant, however, that Clairmont was taken ill at about the same time – according to Mary Shelley&#x27;s journal she was ill on 27 December – and that her journal of June 1818 to early March 1819 has been lost. In a letter to Isabella Hoppner of 10 August 1821, Mary Shelley, however, stated emphatically that &quot;Claire had no child&quot;. She also insisted:

The infant Elena was placed with foster parents and later died on 10 June 1820. Byron believed the rumours about Elena and used them as one more reason not to let Clairmont influence Allegra.

==Later life==

Shortly after Clairmont had introduced Shelley to Byron, she met Edward John Trelawny, who was to play a major role in the short remaining lives of both poets. After Shelley&#x27;s death, Trelawny sent her love letters from Florence pleading with her to marry him, but she was not interested. Still, she remained in contact with him the rest of her long life. Clairmont wrote to Mary Shelley: &quot;He [Trelawny] likes a turbid and troubled life; I a quiet one; he is full of fine feeling and has no principles; I am full of fine principles but never had a feeling (in my life).&quot;

=== Governess in Russia ===
Devastated after Shelley&#x27;s death, Mary returned to England. She paid for Clairmont to travel to her brother&#x27;s home in Vienna where she stayed for a year, before relocating to Russia, where she worked as a governess from 1825 to 1828, firstly in St Petersburg and then in Moscow. During her time in Russia, she witnessed the Decembrist revolt. The people she worked for treated her almost as a member of the family. Still, what Clairmont longed for most of all was privacy and peace and quiet, as she complained in letters to Mary Shelley.

Two Russian men she met commented on her general disdain for the male sex; irritated by their assumption that since she was always falling in love, she would return their affections if they flirted with her, Clairmont joked in a letter to Mary Shelley that perhaps she should fall in love with &quot;both&quot; of them at once and prove them wrong. 

=== Dresden ===
She returned to England in 1828, but remained there only a short while before departing for Dresden, where she was employed as a companion and housekeeper. Scholar Bradford A. Booth suggested in 1938 that Clairmont, driven by a need for money, might have been the true author of most of &quot;The Pole&quot;, an 1830 short story that appeared in the magazine &quot;The Court Assembly and Belle Assemblée&quot; as by &quot;The Author of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;&quot;. Unlike Mary Shelley, Clairmont was familiar with the Polish used in the story. At one point, she thought of writing a book about the dangers that might result from &quot;erroneous opinions&quot; about the relations between men and women, using examples from the lives of Shelley and Byron. She did not make many literary attempts, as she explained to her friend Jane Williams:
=== Return to England ===
In 1836, the year William Godwin died, Clairmont returned to England, where she worked as a music teacher. She cared for her mother when she was dying. In 1841, after Mary Jane Godwin&#x27;s death, Clairmont moved to Pisa, where she lived with Margaret King (officially Lady Margaret Mount Cashell but known as Mrs Mason), an old pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft. She lived in Paris for a time in the 1840s, where she attended Harriet de Boinville&#x27;s social gatherings, crowded with republicans and Italian revolutionaries. In one letter to her stepsister, Mary, she wrote:&quot;At Madame de Boinville&#x27;s the people are clever and I go there and I like the conversation, but I am never allowed to speak myself... after fifteen years being silent, I want to talk a good deal... to clear out my mind of all the ideas that have been accumulating and literally rotting there for so many years – but they won&#x27;t allow me this in Rue Clichy – the instant I speak, the whole coterie fall upon my words and pick them to pieces... seize upon my argument (so dear to me)... they are liberals of such opposite characters... I beg it to be understood that I am the most liberal, I am proud to say, not one of them can keep pace with me in liberality – I leave them all five hundred miles behind me.&quot;Percy Shelley had left her £12,000 in his will, which she finally received in 1844. She carried on a sometimes turbulent, bitter correspondence with her stepsister, until Mary died in 1851.

=== Florence and death ===
Clairmont converted to Catholicism, despite having hated the religion earlier in her life. She moved to Florence in 1870 and lived there in an expatriate colony with her niece, Paulina. She was also close to Paulina&#x27;s brother Wilhelm Gaulis Clairmont, the only other surviving child of her brother Charles. She considered making her home with him and financially supported some of his endeavours, for example with £500 towards the purchase of a farm.

Clairmont also clung to memorabilia of Percy Shelley. &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; by Henry James is inspired by the true story of a retired captain, Edward Silsbee, who tried to purchase the letters that Shelley had written to Clairmont, and which she saved until her death. Clairmont died in Florence on 19 March 1879, at the age of 80 having outlived all the members of Shelley&#x27;s circle except Trelawny and Jane Williams.

== Reputation and legacy ==
Writing for the Wordsworth Trust in 2014, author Lesley McDowell described Clairmont as &quot;the ideal Romantic woman, as conjured up by Mary Wollstonecraft herself in &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;&quot;, adding that &quot;rarely did any other Romantic figure “mix in the throng” and attain knowledge of herself through others, to the extent that Claire Clairmont did.&quot;

==In popular culture==
=== Film ===
The 1816 trip to Switzerland during the Year Without a Summer, during which Clairmont aimed to reunite with Byron, and Mary Shelley began writing &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, is the focus of multiple modern re-tellings in several mediums. She was portrayed by Myriam Cyr in the 1986 Ken Russell film &quot;Gothic&quot;, by Elizabeth Hurley in the Goya Award-winning 1988 Spanish film &quot;Rowing with the Wind&quot;, and by Laura Dern in &quot;Haunted Summer&quot; (1988).

Thirty years later, Clairmont was played by Bel Powley in &quot;Mary Shelley&quot; (2017) and by Nadia Parkes in the Doctor Who episode &quot;The Haunting of Villa Diodati&quot; (2020),

=== Literature ===
Clairmont was depicted in a special edition of the comic book &quot;The Wicked + The Divine&quot;, as an incarnation of the goddess Inanna and a member of the 1830s Pantheon.

<text>Title insurance is a form of indemnity insurance, predominantly found in the United States and Canada, that insures against financial loss from defects in title to real property and from the invalidity or unenforceability of mortgage loans. Unlike some land registration systems in countries outside the United States, US states&#x27; recorders of deeds generally do not guarantee indefeasible title to those recorded titles. Title insurance will defend against a lawsuit attacking the title or reimburse the insured for the actual monetary loss incurred up to the dollar amount of insurance provided by the policy.

The first title insurance company, the Law Property Assurance and Trust Society, was formed in Pennsylvania in 1853. Typically the real property interests insured are fee simple ownership or a mortgage. However, title insurance can be purchased to insure any interest in real property, including an easement, lease, or life estate.

There are two types of policies – owner and lender. Just as lenders require fire insurance and other types of insurance coverage to protect their investment, nearly all institutional lenders also require title insurance to protect their interest in the collateral of loans secured by real estate. Some mortgage lenders, especially non-institutional lenders, may not require title insurance. Buyers purchasing properties for cash or with a mortgage lender often want title insurance as well.

A loan policy provides no coverage or benefit for the buyer/owner and so the decision to purchase an owner policy is independent of the lender&#x27;s decision to require a loan policy.

Title insurance is available in many other countries, such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, China, South Korea, and throughout Europe. However, while a substantial number of properties located in these countries are insured by U.S. title insurers, they do not constitute a significant share of the real estate transactions in those countries. They also do not constitute a large share of U.S. title insurers&#x27; revenues. In many cases these are properties to be used for commercial purposes by U.S. companies doing business abroad, or properties financed by U.S lenders. The U.S. companies involved buy title insurance to obtain the security of a U.S. insurer backing up the evidence of title that they receive from the other country&#x27;s land registration system, and payment of legal defense costs if the title is challenged.

==History==
Prior to the invention of title insurance, buyers in real estate transactions bore sole responsibility for ensuring the validity of the land title held by the seller. If the title were later deemed invalid or found to be fraudulent, the buyer lost his investment.

In 1868, the case of &quot;Watson v. Muirhead&quot; was heard by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Plaintiff Watson had lost his investment in a real estate transaction as the result of a prior lien on the property. Defendant Muirhead, the conveyancer, had discovered the lien prior to the sale but told Watson the title was clear after his lawyer had (erroneously) determined that the lien was not valid.

The courts ruled that Muirhead (and others in similar situations) was not liable for mistakes based on professional opinions. As a result, in 1874, the Pennsylvania legislature passed an act allowing for the incorporation of title insurance companies.

Joshua Morris, a conveyancer in Philadelphia, and several colleagues met on March 28, 1876, to incorporate the first title insurance company. The new firm, Real Estate Title Insurance Company of Philadelphia, would &quot;insure the purchasers of real estate and mortgages against losses from defective titles, liens and encumbrances,&quot; and that &quot;through these facilities, transfer of real estate and real estate securities can be made more speedily and with greater security than heretofore.&quot;

Morris&#x27; aunt purchased the first policy, valued at $1,500, to cover a home on North 43rd Street in Philadelphia.

==Purpose==
There are two types of title systems used worldwide: Land registration and land recording.

Most of the industrialized world uses land registration systems for the transfer of land titles or interests in them. Under these systems, the government determines title ownership and encumbrances using its land registration; with only a few exceptions, the government&#x27;s determination is conclusive. Governmental errors lead to monetary compensation to the person damaged by the error but that aggrieved party usually cannot recover the property. The Torrens title system is the basis for land registration systems in several common law countries. Nineteen jurisdictions in the United States, such as Minnesota and Massachusetts, adopted a form of this system between 1896 and 1917, however it fell out of favor after a single judgement in Imperial County, California, bankrupted the state&#x27;s title indemnification fund, and the vast majority of U.S. states have opted for a system of document recording in which no governmental official makes any determination of who owns the title or whether the instruments transferring it are valid.

In the recording system, each time a land title transaction takes place, the parties record the transfer instrument with a local government recorder located in the jurisdiction (usually the county) where the land lies. The government indexes the instrument by the names of the grantor (transferor) and the grantee (transferee) and photographs it so any member of the public can find and examine it. If such a transaction goes unrecorded for any reason or length of time, an unscrupulous grantor could sell the property to another grantee. In many states, the grantee whose transaction is recorded first becomes the legal owner, and any other would-be buyers are left without recourse.

The advantage of the recording system is:
* In a registration system, the cost and risk are borne by the general public, but in a recording system, cost and risk are borne by the users of the system.
* In a recording system, an independent authority reviews government land transfers. In a registration system government can decide registration disputes in its favor, preventing separation of powers and the constitutional right to due process of law.
* A recording system can provide for conveyance of land for situations beyond the capacity of public records, such as homesteading and inheritance.
* A recording system combined with title insurance decentralizes records, creating redundancy. For example, when many records were destroyed in San Francisco&#x27;s 1906 earthquake, out-of-town title companies maintained records that allowed landowners to prove ownership of their property.

Under this system, to determine who has title, one must:
* Examine the indexes in the recorders&#x27; offices, pursuant to various rules established by state legislatures and courts.
* Scrutinize the recorded instruments.
* Determine how they affect the title under applicable law. The final arbiters of title matters are the courts, which make decisions in suits brought by disagreeing parties. Historically, the person who wanted to understand the title would hire an abstractor to write a property abstract showing the chain of title. However, if the abstractor makes an error, the client may only be compensated if the attorney is negligent, subject to the limit of his financial responsibility (including his liability insurance). However, the willingness of these professionals to accept strict liability varies.

Title insurers conduct a title search on public records before they agree to insure the purchaser or mortgagee of land. Specifically, after a real estate sales contract has been executed and escrow opened, a title professional will search the public records to look for any problems with the home&#x27;s title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic&#x27;s lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, will be required to fix such title defects by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.

Title insurance policies are fairly uniform, and backed by statutory reserves, which is especially important in large commercial real estate transactions where the buyer and their lender have a large amount of money at stake. The insurer also pays for the defense of its insured in legal contests.

At least 20 U.S. states have experimented with Torrens title or other title registration systems at one time or another, but most have retreated to title recording under pressure from title insurers or from lack of interest. According to Karl Llewellyn, one Torrens title on one lot in New York City can render the entire block unavailable for large-scale improvement (i.e., skyscrapers); no lender will finance the purchase of such a lot because no New York title insurer will guarantee a Torrens title. The U.S. title insurance industry has successfully opposed land registration systems by saying that they are vulnerable to fraud (a severe problem in most land registration jurisdictions) and by contending that an inherently contingent property system more effectively protects property rights. Their contention is also that, while it is possible to fortify land registration systems to prevent the registration of forged deeds, the necessary countermeasures are complex and expensive. A 2007 book attacking the American title insurance &quot;cartel&quot; acknowledged that &quot;[m]ore extensive use of Torrens certification would require setting up a special judicially supervised bureaucracy.&quot;

==Types of policies==
Standardized forms of title insurance exist for owners and lenders. The lender&#x27;s policies include a form specifically for construction loans, though this is rarely used today.

===Owner&#x27;s policy===
The owner&#x27;s policy assures a purchaser that the title to the property is vested in that purchaser and that it is free from all defects, liens and encumbrances except those listed as exceptions in the policy or are excluded from the scope of the policy&#x27;s coverage. It also covers losses and damages suffered if the title is unmarketable. The policy also provides coverage for loss if there is no right of access to the land. Although these are the basic coverages, expanded forms of residential owner&#x27;s policies exist that cover additional items of loss.

The liability limit of the owner&#x27;s policy is typically the purchase price paid for the property. As with other types of insurance, coverages can also be added or deleted with an endorsement. There are many forms of standard endorsements to cover a variety of common issues. The premium for the policy may be paid by the seller or buyer as the parties agree. Usually a custom in a particular state or county on this matter reflects in most local real estate contracts. One should inquire about the cost of title insurance before signing a real estate contract that provides that he pay for title charges. A real estate attorney, broker, escrow officer (in the western states), or loan officer can provide detailed information as to the price of title search and insurance before the real estate contract is signed. Title insurance coverage lasts as long as the insured retains an interest in the land insured and typically no additional premium is paid after the policy is issued.

===Lender&#x27;s policy===
This is sometimes called a loan policy and it is issued only to mortgage lenders. Generally speaking, it follows the assignment of the mortgage loan, meaning that the policy benefits the purchaser of the loan if the loan is sold. For this reason, these policies greatly facilitate the sale of mortgages into the secondary market. That market is made up of high volume purchasers such as Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation as well as private institutions.

The American Land Title Association (ALTA) forms are almost universally used in the country though they have been modified in some states. In general, the basic elements of insurance they provide to the lender cover losses from the following matters:

#The title to the property on which the mortgage is being made is either
#*Not in the mortgage loan borrower,
#*Subject to defects, liens or encumbrances, or
#*Unmarketable.
#There is no right of access to the land.
#The lien created by the mortgage:
#*is invalid or unenforceable,
#*is not prior to any other lien existing on the property on the date the policy is written, or
#*is subject to mechanic&#x27;s liens under certain circumstances.

As with all of the ALTA forms, the policy also covers the cost of defending insured matters against attack.

Elements 1 and 2 are important to the lender because they cover its expectations of the title it will receive if it must foreclose its mortgage. Element 3 covers matters that will interfere with its foreclosure.

Of course, all of the policies except or exclude certain matters and are subject to various conditions.

There are also ALTA mortgage policies covering single or one-to-four family housing mortgages. These cover the elements of loss listed above plus others. Examples of the other coverages are loss from forged releases of the mortgage and loss resulting from encroachments of improvements on adjoining land onto the mortgaged property when the improvements are constructed after the loan is made.

===Construction loan policy=== 
In many states, separate policies exist for construction loans. Title insurance for construction loans require a Date Down endorsement that recognizes that the insured amount for the property has increased due to construction funds that have been vested into the property.

==Land title associations and standardized policies==
In the United States, the American Land Title Association (ALTA) is a national non-profit trade association representing the interests of nearly 4,500 title insurance companies, title agents, independent abstracters, title searchers and attorneys across the United States. ALTA members conduct title searches, examinations, closings, and issue title insurance that protects real property owners and mortgage lenders against losses from defects in titles.

Founded in 1907, ALTA has created standard forms of title insurance policy &quot;jackets&quot; (standard terms and conditions) for Owners, Lenders and Construction Loan policies. ALTA forms are used in most, but not all, U.S. states. ALTA also offers special endorsement forms for the various policies; endorsements amend and typically broaden the coverage given under a basic title insurance policy. ALTA does not issue title insurance; it provides standardized policy and endorsement forms that most title insurers issue.

Some states, including Texas and New York, may mandate the use of forms of title insurance policy jackets and endorsements approved by the state insurance commissioner for properties located in those jurisdictions, but these forms are usually similar or identical to ALTA forms.

In addition to ALTA, the National Association of Independent Land Title Agents (NAILTA) is a national non-profit trade association that represents the interests of independent title insurance agents and independent real estate settlement professionals from across the United States. It was created by independent real estate settlement professionals to further the agenda of small business owners from within the title insurance, abstracting, surveying, and real estate community who lack representation at local, state and national levels. NAILTA is a national trade association that serves thousands of independent title and real estate professionals across the United States who collectively comprise over 60% of the national title insurance market, and identify themselves as independent settlement service providers. NAILTA represents the interests of those independent settlement service providers who serve over 31 million real estate purchase consumers per year, who close an estimated $514.8 billion&#x27;s worth of refinance mortgages per year, and who collectively insure approximately $1.67 trillion in total national title insurance liability per year.

==Comparison with other forms of insurance==
Title insurance differs in several respects from other types of insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring the payoff, or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. Title insurance companies also have the ability to discharge ancient mortgages under the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL) in New York. Ancient mortgages are ones that are presumed to be satisfied or complete and have been for over 20 years. In the alternative, it may except from the policy&#x27;s coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, with the goal of increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.

The explanation above discloses another difference between title insurance and other types: title insurance premiums are not principally calculated on the basis of actuarial science, as is true in most other types of insurance. Instead of correlating the probability of losses with their projected costs, title insurance seeks to eliminate the source of the losses through the use of the recording system and other underwriting practices. As a result, a relatively small fraction of title insurance premiums are used to pay insured losses. The great majority of the premiums is used to finance the title research on each piece of property and to maintain the title plants used to efficiently do that research. There is significant social utility in this approach as the result conforms with the expectations of most property purchasers and mortgage lenders. Generally, they want the real estate they purchased or lent money on to have the title condition they expected when they entered the transaction, rather than money compensation and litigation over unexpected defects. This is not to say that title insurers take no actuarial risks. There are several matters that can affect the title to land that are not disclosed by the recording system but that are covered by the policies. Some examples are deeds executed by minors or mentally incompetent persons, forged instruments (in some cases), corporate instruments executed without the proper corporate authority and errors in the public records. However, historically, these problems have not amounted to a high percentage of the losses paid by the insurers. A more significant percentage of losses paid by the insurers are the result of errors and omissions in the title examining process itself.

==Homeowner&#x27;s right to choose a title insurance company==
In an April 2007 United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report on Title Insurance, the GAO recommended that state and federal legislators and regulators improve consumers ability to shop for title insurance based on price, encourage price competition, and ensure consumers are paying reasonable prices for title insurance.

A federal law called the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) entitles an individual homeowner to choose a title insurance company when purchasing or refinancing residential property. Typically, homeowners do not make this decision for themselves and instead rely on their bank&#x27;s or attorney&#x27;s choice; however, the homeowner retains the right to choose a different insurer. RESPA makes it unlawful for any bank, broker, or attorney to mandate that a particular title insurance company be used. Doing so is a violation of federal law and any person or business doing so can be fined or lose its license.

Section 9 of RESPA prohibits a seller from requiring the buyer to use a particular title insurance company, either directly or indirectly, as a condition of sale. Buyers may sue a seller who violates this provision for an amount equal to three times all charges made for the title insurance. The only exception to this rule applies to commercial real estate transactions, which is not within the parameters of RESPA.

The new Loan Estimate form (LE) is the latest step taken by Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to protect and assist consumers. In the past, lenders had provided potential borrowers with Good Faith Estimates (GFEs).

1. Lenders must issue the LE within three business days of loan application. However, many will provide the form to borrowers who are still in the shopping phase. Note that the LE provides more protections for consumers than a &quot;worksheet&quot; or &quot;scenario&quot; because lenders must by law adhere to its costs and indicate how long that rate and fee will be in effect.

If a loan originator does not provide the LE within three business days of receiving a completed loan application, it is in violation of Section 5 of RESPA. HUD provides the specific criteria for what constitutes a complete loan application:

:* Borrower&#x27;s name
:* Borrower&#x27;s monthly income
:* Borrower&#x27;s Social Security number (SSN) (to obtain a credit report)
:* Property address
:* The estimated value of the property
:* Loan amount
:* Anything else the lender deems necessary

2. The new LE is standardized
:All lenders must provide consumers with the exact same document. Loan charges, third-party fees, and other costs must be displayed uniformly.

3. The new LE encourages consumers to shop
:Since lenders are now required to issue a standardized LE in a specific time frame, consumers are provided an opportunity to compare lenders and their products. Further, HUD states that prior to the issuance of a LE, lenders can only charge potential borrowers a fee to cover the expense of a credit report. The relative low cost of credit reports ($15–30) results in consumers&#x27; ability to comparison shop many lenders at a minimal cost.

4. Lenders are accountable for their quotes
:The new LE form puts the most important facts about a mortgage on the first page instead of burying them in small print throughout the form. This information includes:
:* Loan amount, interest rate, and principal and interest payment. 
:* The existence of prepayment penalties, negative or balloon payments
:* It alerts the borrower if the interest rate, loan balance or payment can increase during the loan&#x27;s term
:* Projected payments in future years, based on current financial indexes (mostly applies to adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs)
:* Estimated escrows (also called impounds), which are payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance added to the monthly payment. the lender then pays these amounts on behalf of the borrower when they come due
:* Total closing costs and cost to close (how much the borrower must bring to the closing)

5. At the closing, lenders must issue a Closing Disclosure (CD) disclosing the actual costs. The borrower can compare the actual costs to the estimated costs. Costs fall into several categories, and differences between the actual and estimated costs are treated accordingly:

::a. 0% Tolerance. If at the closing, any item in the 0% Tolerance category is higher on the corresponding section of the CD compared to the original LE, the lender is responsible for covering the difference.
::b. 10% Tolerance. Unlike the 0% Tolerance category, these items are not compared individually to their corresponding section in the CD. Instead, all items in the category are aggregated on the LE and compared to the aggregated corresponding items on the CD. In the event that the CD has a total more than 10% higher than the total on the LE, the lender is responsible for any expense in excess of the 10% increase. This means that individual items in the 10% Tolerance category may increase more than 10% from the LE to the CD without a penalty to the lender, as long as the sum of all the items does not increase more than 10%.
::c. No Tolerance. A few sections of the new LE fall into the No Tolerance category. These quotes can change with no penalty to the lender.
::Again, depending on the state, region, and vendor, homeowners can save substantial money by shopping around for title insurance except in some states, such as Texas, in which the rates are codified by law. In light of the changes made by RESPA and those to the LE, notable consumer and business publications have featured articles about the benefits of shopping around for title insurance, such as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance, HSH.com, Forbes.com, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

== Affiliated business arrangements ==

Sometimes, several businesses that offer settlement services are owned or controlled by a common corporate parent. These businesses are known as &quot;affiliates&quot;, while the relationship is called an affiliated business arrangement (ABA).

When a lender, real estate broker, or other participant refers his homebuyer to an affiliate for a settlement service (such as when a real estate broker refers his homebuyer to a mortgage broker affiliate), the law requires the referring party to provide an affiliated business arrangement disclosure. This disclosure informs homebuyers they are not required to use the affiliate and are free to shop for other providers.

Despite advances in technology that allow homebuyers to shop for title services, many homebuyers remain unaware that they may select their own title insurance or settlement company.

A recent survey from the Ohio Association of Independent Title Agents (OAITA), conducted from 2009 through 2010, showed when homebuyers are made fully aware of ABAs, they become uncomfortable and prefer a title company or title agent to be a third party (i.e., independent) to the transaction.

While 77% of respondents did not independently select their settlement company, when made fully aware of the ABA relationships 50% of respondents said they prefer a title company that does not share profits with a referral source compared to 6% of respondents saying they prefer a title agent that shares profits with a referral source. Further, 58% of respondents said they believe that ABAs are a conflict of interest.

The OAITA stands in stark contrast to two Harris Interactive surveys used by the Real Estate Services Providers Council in a January 2011 meeting with Federal Reserve staff to claim that homebuyers were more satisfied with the ABA settlement service providers.

* A 2002 study used by the proponents revealed that 64% of homebuyers who used &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; programs had a better overall experience with their home purchase transaction.
* A 2008 study revealed that homebuyers who used &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; in their latest real estate transaction were more satisfied with their home buying experience compared to those who used services of multiple providers.

Organizations such as the National Association of Independent Land Title Agents seek to restore transparency and credibility to the land title process and to preserve an objective and impartial role at the closing table to improve the consumer experience, by addressing the proliferation of controlled business arrangements and eliminating conflicts of interest between title agents and their referral sources, as well as between all real estate settlement service providers and their sources of business.

==Cost of title insurance==
The cost of title insurance has two components: premium charges and service fees.

Title insurance premium rates are based on five cost considerations, including those related to:

# Maintaining current title information on property local to that operation, i.e., title plant
# Searching and examining the title to subject properties
# Resolving or clearing defects to title
# Covering title defects
# Allowing for a reasonable profit

===Premium charges===
Like the rates for other forms of insurance, rates for title insurance usually are regulated by state governments to ensure that premiums are not excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory to the public. States have different methods of regulating title insurance rates. The types of rate regulation used include:
* Promulgation: State regulatory body sets the rates. An example is Texas, where rates are set after comprehensive hearings each year.
* Prior approval: Insurers propose rates, which must be reviewed formally and approved explicitly or deemed approved by the regulatory body before they can be charged.
* File and use: Insurers set rates, but they cannot be charged until the regulator has been notified and allowed time to review and action, if necessary. In some prior-approval states, almost the same result is achieved through a so-called deemer provision. Under a deemer, rates proposed by insurers are deemed approved if the regulatory body takes no action to disapprove a filing within a specified time, and the filer notifies the state that the rates are being deemed approved.
* Use and file: Insurers set rates that can be charged immediately, as long as the new rate schedule is filed with the regulatory body.
* No direct rate regulation: Insurers set rates that can be changed at an insurer&#x27;s discretion. Even in this apparent unregulated situation, a regulatory body still is charged with overseeing the title insurance industry and can question the propriety of a rate that appears to be unfairly discriminatory or otherwise violates statutory standards. Examples are Illinois, Georgia and Massachusetts.

The rates may include discounts if title insurance is ordered within a specified time after the last policy issued or if the mortgage being insured is a refinance of an earlier mortgage. In the states employing any of these regulations, it is illegal for title insurance companies to charge a higher or lower rate than the regulated rate.

For example: In Pennsylvania there are two rates, basic rate and reissue rate. The basic rate would apply if it has been more than ten years since the last policy was issued. If less than ten years, the reissue rate applies. The reissue rate offers a discount of approximately ten percent off of the basic rate. If the transaction is a refinance, the savings can be as much as thirty percent off of the reissue rate. These rates and applicable discounts are filed with and approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission.

Title insurance is substantially different from other lines of insurance because it emphasizes risk prevention rather than risk assumption. This means the majority of the premium dollar, about 80 percent, covers the work performed by title professionals, such as the search examination, curative work, policy issuance and, frequently, the settlement or closing. The remaining 20 percent covers the insurance policy, a significant portion of which is put into reserves for claims that could occur 10 or 20 years in the future. According to a 2006 survey by ALTA, title problems that required curative action were found in 36 percent of all residential real estate transactions in 2005. This was up from 25 percent in 2000, due to the booming real estate market and an increase in transactions.

===Service fees===
In some states, the regulated premium charge does not include part of the underwriting costs necessary for the process. In those states, title insurers may also charge search or abstracting fees for searching the public records, or examination fees to compensate them for the title examination. These fees are usually not regulated and in those cases may sometimes be negotiated. In some states, regulation requires that the title insurer base its policy on the opinion of an attorney. The attorney&#x27;s fees are not regulated. They are also not part of the title insurance premium, though the title insurer may include those fees within its invoice as a convenience to the attorney rendering the opinion. Similarly, fees for closing a sale or mortgage transaction are not regulated in most states though the charge for closing may appear in the invoice disclosing the total charges for the transaction.

==Industry profitability==

The title industry is highly dependent on real estate markets, which, in turn, are highly sensitive to mortgage interest rates and the overall economic well-being. During the housing bubble from 2000 through 2006, the industry&#x27;s revenue more than doubled. As the surge in real estate transactions drove up title insurance revenue—along with a greater incidence of claims—the economic downturn that started in 2007 pared back revenue significantly for several years. To compare, the industry reported nearly $17 billion in title insurance premiums in 2005, but volume fell to $9.6 billion in 2009.
In 2012, according to ALTA, the industry paid out about $908 million in claims, about 8.1% of the $11.2 billion taken in as premiums. By comparison, the boiler insurance industry, which like title insurance requires an emphasis on inspections and risk analysis, pays 25% of its premiums in claims. As mentioned above, professionals in the land title industry seek to prevent claims through up-front preventive measures before a policy is issued and therefore the industry&#x27;s claims ratio is different from other lines of insurance.

According to the statutory accounting rules for title insurance, only reported claims are reflected in the loss expense, while in other lines—both reported and unreported claims are included in the loss expense. As a result, timing differences occur in the reporting of losses and loss-adjustment expenses for title insurance when compared to other lines. In addition, title insurance, unlike most other property/casualty exposures, has no termination date and no time limitation on filing claims.

In many states, the price of title insurance is regulated by a state insurance commission. In these states, the title insurance companies lobby state legislators and other politicians and donate to their campaigns, in the hopes of maintaining high rates. Unlike other forms of insurance (such as life, medical, or home owners), title insurance is not paid for annually, as it has one payment for the term of the policy, which is in effect until the property is resold or refinanced.

==Relative market share among U.S. title insurers==
The following discloses the relative 2012 market shares among the four U.S. national families of title insurers (Fidelity National Financial, First American, Stewart, and Old Republic), and the regional companies, i.e., those not affiliated with the national families.

As of January 2009, Fidelity National Financial held the highest market share, due to its acquisition of LandAmerica&#x27;s Commonwealth Land Title, Lawyers Title, and United Capital Title units subsequent to LandAmerica&#x27;s declaration of bankruptcy.

<text>Kate Elliott is the pen name of American fantasy and science fiction writer Alis A. Rasmussen (born 1958).

== Writing ==
Although Rasmussen&#x27;s first novels &quot;The Labyrinth Gate&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Highroad&quot; (1990) (a science fiction trilogy) failed to become bestsellers, additional publishers liked her manuscripts. However, they wanted a fresh name unconnected with the sales figures of the previous books. Starting in 1992 under the new name of Kate Elliott, her sales have flourished. The Crown of Stars series has been featured in the Science Fiction Book Club.

Elliott published the first of her &quot;Jaran&quot; series in 1992, although she began the first draft in 1980. Heather Massey&#x27;s review of &quot;Jaran&quot; describes it as &quot;a science fiction romance classic&quot;, while Todd Richmond in an &quot;SF Site&quot; review calls the series &quot;an epic masterpiece&quot;. The &quot;Highroad&quot; (as Alis Rasmussen) trilogy is set in the same universe as &quot;Jaran&quot; as a prequel.

The 1996 collaboration between Elliott, Melanie Rawn, and Jennifer Roberson on &quot;The Golden Key&quot; was coordinated primarily via fax machine.

In 2020, Elliott published &quot;Unconquerable Sun&quot;, the first novel in a gender-bending space opera trilogy based on Alexander the Great.

==Personal life==
A native of Junction City, Oregon, Rasmussen moved to Oakland, California to attend Mills College. There she became active in the Society for Creative Anachronism where she pursued medieval sword fighting.

Rasmussen, her archaeologist husband Jay Silverstein, and their three children live in Hawaii.

<doc id="563847" wikidata="Q1319010" url="?curid=563847" title="Electromigration">
<text>Electromigration is the transport of material caused by the gradual movement of the ions in a conductor due to the momentum transfer between conducting electrons and diffusing metal atoms. The effect is important in applications where high direct current densities are used, such as in microelectronics and related structures. As the structure size in electronics such as integrated circuits (ICs) decreases, the practical significance of this effect increases.

== History ==
The phenomenon of electromigration has been known for over 100 years, having been discovered by the French scientist Gerardin. The topic first became of practical interest during the late 1960s when packaged ICs first appeared. The earliest commercially available ICs failed in a mere three weeks of use from runaway electromigration, which led to a major industry effort to correct this problem. The first observation of electromigration in thin films was made by I. Blech. Research in this field was pioneered by a number of investigators throughout the fledgling semiconductor industry. One of the most important engineering studies was performed by Jim Black of Motorola, after whom Black&#x27;s equation is named. At the time, the metal interconnects in ICs were still about 10 micrometres wide. Currently interconnects are only hundreds to tens of nanometers in width, making research in electromigration increasingly important.

== Practical implications of electromigration ==

Electromigration decreases the reliability of integrated circuits (ICs). It can cause the eventual loss of connections or failure of a circuit. Since reliability is critically important for space travel, military purposes, anti-lock braking systems, medical equipment like Automated External Defibrillators and is even important for personal computers or home entertainment systems, the reliability of chips (ICs) is a major focus of research efforts.

Due to the difficulty of testing under real-world conditions, Black&#x27;s equation is used to predict the life span of integrated circuits.
To use Black&#x27;s equation, the component is put through high temperature operating life (HTOL) testing. The component&#x27;s expected life span under real conditions is extrapolated from data gathered during this testing.

Although damage from electromigration ultimately results in the failure of the affected IC, the first symptoms are intermittent glitches, which are quite challenging to diagnose. As some interconnects fail before others, the circuit exhibits seemingly random errors, which may be indistinguishable from other failure mechanisms (such as electrostatic discharge damage). In a laboratory setting, electromigration failure is readily imaged with an electron microscope, as interconnect erosion leaves telltale visual markers on the metal layers of the IC.

With increasing miniaturization, the probability of failure due to electromigration increases in VLSI and ULSI circuits because both the power density and the current density increase. Specifically, line widths will continue to decrease over time, as will wire cross-sectional areas. Currents are also reduced due to lower supply voltages and shrinking gate capacitances. However, as current reduction is constrained by increasing frequencies, the more marked decrease in cross-sectional areas (compared to current reduction) will give rise to increased current densities in ICs going forward.

In advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, copper has replaced aluminium as the interconnect material of choice. Despite its greater fragility in the fabrication process, copper is preferred for its superior conductivity. It is also intrinsically less susceptible to electromigration. However, electromigration (EM) continues to be an ever-present challenge to device fabrication, and therefore the EM research for copper interconnects is ongoing (though a relatively new field).

In modern consumer electronic devices, ICs rarely fail due to electromigration effects. This is because proper semiconductor design practices incorporate the effects of electromigration into the IC&#x27;s layout. Nearly all IC design houses use automated EDA tools to check and correct electromigration problems at the transistor layout-level. When operated within the manufacturer&#x27;s specified temperature and voltage range, a properly designed IC device is more likely to fail from other (environmental) causes, such as cumulative damage from gamma-ray bombardment.

Nevertheless, there have been documented cases of product failures due to electromigration. In the late 1980s, one line of Western Digital&#x27;s desktop drives suffered widespread, predictable failure after 12–18 months of field usage. Using forensic analysis of the returned bad units, engineers identified improper design-rules in a third-party supplier&#x27;s IC controller. By replacing the bad component with that of a different supplier, WD was able to correct the flaw, but not before significant damage was done to the company&#x27;s reputation.

Electromigration can be a cause of degradation in some power semiconductor devices such as low voltage power MOSFETs, in which the lateral current through the source contact metallisation (often aluminium) can reach the critical current densities during overload conditions. The degradation of the aluminium layer causes an increase in on-state resistance, and can eventually lead to complete failure.

== Fundamentals ==
The material properties of the metal interconnects have a strong influence on their life span. The characteristics are predominantly the composition of the metal alloy and the dimensions of the conductor. The shape of the conductor, the crystallographic orientation of the grains in the metal, procedures for the layer deposition, heat treatment or annealing, characteristics of the passivation, and the interface to other materials also affect the durability of the interconnects. There are also important differences with time dependent current: direct current or different alternating current waveforms cause different effects.

=== Forces on ions in an electrical field ===
Two forces affect ionized atoms in a conductor: 1) The direct electrostatic force &quot;Fe&quot;, as a result of the electric field formula_1, which has the same direction as the electric field, and 2) The force from the exchange of momentum with other charge carriers &quot;Fp&quot;, toward the flow of charge carriers, is in the opposite direction of the electric field. In metallic conductors &quot;Fp&quot; is caused by a so-called &quot;electron wind&quot; or &quot;ion wind&quot;.

The resulting force &quot;Fres&quot; on an activated ion in the electrical field can be written as

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the electric charge of the ions,formula_4 and formula_5 the valences corresponding to the electrostatic and wind force respectively, formula_6 the so-called effective valence of the material, formula_7 the current density, and formula_8 the resistivity of the material
Electromigration occurs when some of the momentum of a moving electron is transferred to a nearby activated ion. This causes the ion to move from its original position. Over time this force knocks a significant number of atoms far from their original positions. A break or gap can develop in the conducting material, preventing the flow of electricity. In narrow interconnect conductors, such as those linking transistors and other components in integrated circuits, this is known as a &quot;void&quot; or &quot;internal&quot; &quot;failure&quot; (open circuit). Electromigration can also cause the atoms of a conductor to pile up and drift toward other nearby conductors, creating an unintended electrical connection known as a hillock failure or whisker failure (short circuit). Both of these situations can lead to a malfunction of the circuit.
== Step Bunching due to Electromigration == 
Step bunching on DC-heated sublimating vicinal crystal surfaces of Si(111) was observed by A. Latyshev et al. in 1989. Soon after, Stoyan Stoyanov advanced a model in which as the reason for step bunching is identified the biased diffusion of the adatoms. In 1998, Stoyanov and Tonchev extended Stoyanov’s model by incorporating step-step repulsions and derived a scaling relation for the minimal step-step distance in a bunch under diffusion-limited sublimation, non-transparent steps, and step-down current conditions:

formula_9

where formula_10 is the number of steps in the bunch, and the proportionality coefficient has the dimension of length. This scaling law has been confirmed by numerous experimental studies. In 2018, Toktarbaiuly et al. reported electromigration-induced step bunching on vicinal W(110) surfaces. Their study revealed that step bunching occurred for both step-up and step-down current directions at the same temperature, T = 1500°C, with distinct size-scaling exponents depending on the current direction. 
More recently, Usov et al. (2020) demonstrated that electromigration-induced step bunching is not limited to silicon surfaces but can also occur on dielectric surfaces, such as sapphire (Al₂O₃(0001)). 
This study suggests that the fundamental mechanism of step bunching on W(110), Al₂O₃(0001), and Si(111) follows similar principles. Moreover, annealing W(110) offcut in the [001] direction with an up-step current produced a morphology where the bunch edges formed zigzag segments meeting at right angles.

== Failure mechanisms ==

=== Diffusion mechanisms ===

In a homogeneous crystalline structure, because of the uniform lattice structure of the metal ions, there is hardly any momentum transfer between the conduction electrons and the metal ions. However, this symmetry does not exist at the grain boundaries and material interfaces, and so here momentum is transferred much more vigorously. Since the metal ions in these regions are bonded more weakly than in a regular crystal lattice, once the electron wind has reached a certain strength, atoms become separated from the grain boundaries and are transported in the direction of the current. This direction is also influenced by the grain boundary itself, because atoms tend to move along grain boundaries.

Diffusion processes caused by electromigration can be divided into grain boundary diffusion, bulk diffusion and surface diffusion. In general, grain boundary diffusion is the major electromigration process in aluminum wires, whereas surface diffusion is dominant in copper interconnects.

=== Thermal effects ===

In an ideal conductor, where atoms are arranged in a perfect lattice structure, the electrons moving through it would experience no collisions and electromigration would not occur. In real conductors, defects in the lattice structure and the random thermal vibration of the atoms about their positions causes electrons to collide with the atoms and scatter, which is the source of electrical resistance (at least in metals; see electrical conduction). Normally, the amount of momentum imparted by the relatively low-mass electrons is not enough to permanently displace the atoms. However, in high-power situations (such as with the increasing current draw and decreasing wire sizes in modern VLSI microprocessors), if many electrons bombard the atoms with enough force to become significant, this will accelerate the process of electromigration by causing the atoms of the conductor to vibrate further from their ideal lattice positions, increasing the amount of electron scattering. High current density increases the number of electrons scattering against the atoms of the conductor, and hence the rate at which those atoms are displaced.

In integrated circuits, electromigration does not occur in semiconductors directly, but in the metal interconnects deposited onto them (see semiconductor device fabrication).

Electromigration is exacerbated by high current densities and the Joule heating of the conductor (see electrical resistance), and can lead to eventual failure of electrical components. Localized increase of current density is known as current crowding.

=== Balance of atom concentration ===
A governing equation which describes the atom concentration evolution throughout some interconnect segment, is the conventional mass balance (continuity) equation

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the atom concentration at the point with a coordinates formula_13 at the moment of time formula_14, and formula_15 is the total atomic flux at this location. The total atomic flux formula_15 is a combination of the fluxes caused by the different atom migration forces. The major forces are induced by the electric current, and by the gradients of temperature, mechanical stress and concentration. formula_17.

To define the fluxes mentioned above:

: formula_18. 
Here formula_19 is the electron charge, formula_20 is the effective charge of the migrating atom, formula_8 the resistivity of the conductor where atom migration takes place, formula_22 is the local current density, formula_23 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_24 is the absolute temperature. formula_25 is the time and position dependent atom diffusivity.

: formula_26.  We use formula_27 the heat of thermal diffusion.

: formula_28, 
here formula_29 is the atomic volume and formula_30 is initial atomic concentration, formula_31 is the hydrostatic stress and formula_32 are the components of principal stress.

: formula_33.

Assuming a vacancy mechanism for atom diffusion we can express formula_34 as a function of the hydrostatic stress formula_35 where formula_36 is the effective activation energy of the thermal diffusion of metal atoms. The vacancy concentration represents availability of empty lattice sites, which might be occupied by a migrating atom.

== Electromigration-aware design ==

=== Electromigration reliability of a wire (Black&#x27;s equation) ===
At the end of the 1960s J. R. Black developed an empirical model to estimate the MTTF (mean time to failure) of a wire, taking electromigration into consideration. Since then, the formula has gained popularity in the semiconductor industry:

:formula_37.

Here formula_38 is a constant based on the cross-sectional area of the interconnect, formula_15 is the current density, formula_40 is the activation energy (e.g. 0.7 eV for grain boundary diffusion in aluminum), formula_23 is the Boltzmann constant, formula_24 is the temperature in kelvins, and formula_43 a scaling factor (usually set to 2 according to Black). The temperature of the conductor appears in the exponent, i.e. it strongly affects the MTTF of the interconnect. For an interconnect of a given construction to remain reliable as the temperature rises, the current density within the conductor must be reduced. However, as interconnect technology advances at the nanometer scale, the validity of Black&#x27;s equation becomes increasingly questionable.

=== Wire material ===
Historically, aluminium has been used as conductor in integrated circuits, due to its good adherence to substrate, good conductivity, and ability to form ohmic contacts with silicon. However, pure aluminium is susceptible to electromigration. Research shows that adding 2-4% of copper to aluminium increases resistance to electromigration about 50 times. The effect is attributed to the grain boundary segregation of copper, which greatly inhibits the diffusion of aluminium atoms across grain boundaries.

Pure copper wires can withstand approximately five times more current density than aluminum wires while maintaining similar reliability requirements. This is mainly due to the higher electromigration activation energy levels of copper, caused by its superior electrical and thermal conductivity as well as its higher melting point. Further improvements can be achieved by alloying copper with about 1% palladium which inhibits diffusion of copper atoms along grain boundaries in the same way as the addition of copper to aluminium interconnect.

=== Bamboo structure and metal slotting ===
A wider wire results in smaller current density and, hence, less likelihood of electromigration. Also, the metal grain size has influence; the smaller grains, the more grain boundaries and the higher likelihood of electromigration effects. However, if you reduce wire width to below the average grain size of the wire material, grain boundaries become &quot;crosswise&quot;, more or less perpendicular to the length of the wire. The resulting structure resembles the joints in a stalk of bamboo. With such a structure, the resistance to electromigration increases, despite an increase in current density. This apparent contradiction is caused by the perpendicular position of the grain boundaries; the boundary diffusion factor is excluded, and material transport is correspondingly reduced.

However, the maximum wire width possible for a bamboo structure is usually too narrow for signal lines of large-magnitude currents in analog circuits or for power supply lines. In these circumstances, slotted wires are often used, whereby rectangular holes are carved in the wires. Here, the widths of the individual metal structures in between the slots lie within the area of a bamboo structure, while the resulting total width of all the metal structures meets power requirements.

=== Blech length ===
There is a lower limit for the length of the interconnect that will allow higher current carrying capability. It is known as &quot;Blech length&quot;. Any wire that has a length below this limit will have a stretched limit for electromigration. Here, a mechanical stress buildup causes an atom back flow process which reduces or even compensates the effective material flow towards the anode. The Blech length must be considered when designing test structures to evaluate electromigration. This minimum length is typically some tens of microns for chip traces, and interconnections shorter than this are sometimes referred to as &#x27;electromigration immortal&#x27;.

=== Via arrangements and corner bends ===
Particular attention must be paid to vias and contact holes. The current carrying capacity of a via is much less than a metallic wire of same length. Hence multiple vias are often used, whereby the geometry of the via array is very significant: multiple vias must be organized such that the resulting current is distributed as evenly as possible through all the vias.

Attention must also be paid to bends in interconnects. In particular, 90-degree corner bends must be avoided, since the current density in such bends is significantly higher than that in oblique angles (e.g., 135 degrees).

=== Electromigration in solder joints ===
The typical current density at which electromigration occurs in Cu or Al interconnects is 106 to 107 A/cm2. For solder joints (SnPb or SnAgCu lead-free) used in IC chips, however, electromigration occurs at much lower current densities, e.g. 104 A/cm2.
It causes a net atom transport along the direction of electron flow. The atoms accumulate at the anode, while voids are generated at the cathode and back stress is induced during electromigration. The typical failure of a solder joint due to electromigration will occur at the cathode side. Due to the current crowding effect, voids form first at the corners of the solder joint. Then the voids extend and join to cause a failure. Electromigration also influences formation of intermetallic compounds, as the migration rates are a function of atomic mass.

=== Electromigration and technology computer aided design ===
The complete mathematical model describing electromigration consists of several partial differential equations (PDEs) which need to be solved for three-dimensional geometrical domains representing segments of an interconnect structure. Such a mathematical model forms the basis for simulation of electromigration in modern technology computer aided design (TCAD) tools.
Use of TCAD tools for detailed investigations of electromigration induced interconnect degradation is gaining importance. Results of TCAD studies in combination with reliability tests lead to modification of design rules improving the interconnect resistance to electromigration.

=== Electromigration due to IR drop noise of the on-chip power grid network/interconnect ===

The electromigration degradation of the on-chip power grid network/interconnect depends on the IR drop noise of the power grid interconnect.
The electromigration-aware lifetime of the power grid interconnects as well as the chip decreases if the chip suffers from a high value of the IR drop noise.

=== Machine Learning Model for Electromigration-aware MTTF Prediction===

Recent work demonstrates MTTF prediction using a machine learning model. The work uses a neural network-based supervised learning approach with current density, interconnect length, interconnect temperature as input features to the model.

==Electromigrated nanogaps ==
Electromigrated nanogaps are gaps formed in metallic bridges formed by the process of electromigration. A nanosized contact formed by electromigration acts like a waveguide for electrons. The nanocontact essentially acts like a one-dimensional wire with a conductance of formula_44. The current in a wire is the velocity of the electrons multiplied by the charge and number per unit length, formula_45 or formula_46. This gives a conductance of formula_47. In nanoscale bridges the conductance falls in discrete steps of multiples of the quantum conductance formula_44.

Electromigrated nanogaps have been proposed for use as electrodes in molecular scale electronics and as quantum tunneling sensors. Researchers have used feedback controlled electromigration to investigate the magnetoresistance of a quantum spin valve.

<doc id="563854" wikidata="Q5570875" url="?curid=563854" title="Global optimization">
<text>Global optimization is a branch of operations research, applied mathematics, and numerical analysis that attempts to find the global minima or maxima of a function or a set of functions on a given set. It is usually described as a minimization problem because the maximization of the real-valued function formula_1 is equivalent to the minimization of the function formula_2. 

Given a possibly nonlinear and non-convex continuous function formula_3 with the global minima formula_4 and the set of all global minimizers formula_5 in formula_6, the standard minimization problem can be given as 
:formula_7
that is, finding formula_4 and a global minimizer in formula_5; where formula_6 is a (not necessarily convex) compact set defined by inequalities formula_11.

Global optimization is distinguished from local optimization by its focus on finding the minimum or maximum over the given set, as opposed to finding &quot;local&quot; minima or maxima. Finding an arbitrary local minimum is relatively straightforward by using classical &quot;local optimization&quot; methods. Finding the global minimum of a function is far more difficult: analytical methods are frequently not applicable, and the use of numerical solution strategies often leads to very hard challenges.

== Applications ==
Typical examples of global optimization applications include:
* Protein structure prediction (minimize the energy/free energy function)
* Computational phylogenetics (e.g., minimize the number of character transformations in the tree)
* Traveling salesman problem and electrical circuit design (minimize the path length)
* Chemical engineering (e.g., analyzing the Gibbs energy)
* Safety verification, safety engineering (e.g., of mechanical structures, buildings)
* Worst-case analysis
* Mathematical problems (e.g., the Kepler conjecture)
* Object packing (configuration design) problems
* The starting point of several molecular dynamics simulations consists of an initial optimization of the energy of the system to be simulated.
* Spin glasses
* Calibration of radio propagation models and of many other models in the sciences and engineering
* Curve fitting like non-linear least squares analysis and other generalizations, used in fitting model parameters to experimental data in chemistry, physics, biology, economics, finance, medicine, astronomy, engineering.
*IMRT radiation therapy planning

== Deterministic methods ==

The most successful general exact strategies are:

===Inner and outer approximation===
In both of these strategies, the set over which a function is to be optimized is approximated by polyhedra. In inner approximation, the polyhedra are contained in the set, while in outer approximation, the polyhedra contain the set.

===Cutting-plane methods===

The cutting-plane method is an umbrella term for optimization methods which iteratively refine a feasible set or objective function by means of linear inequalities, termed &quot;cuts&quot;. Such procedures are popularly used to find integer solutions to mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems, as well as to solve general, not necessarily differentiable convex optimization problems. The use of cutting planes to solve MILP was introduced by Ralph E. Gomory and Václav Chvátal.

===Branch and bound methods===

Branch and bound (BB or B&amp;B) is an algorithm design paradigm for discrete and combinatorial optimization problems. A branch-and-bound algorithm consists of a systematic enumeration of candidate solutions by means of state space search: the set of candidate solutions is thought of as forming a rooted tree with the full set at the root. The algorithm explores &quot;branches&quot; of this tree, which represent subsets of the solution set. Before enumerating the candidate solutions of a branch, the branch is checked against upper and lower estimated &quot;bounds&quot; on the optimal solution, and is discarded if it cannot produce a better solution than the best one found so far by the algorithm.

===Interval methods===

Interval arithmetic, interval mathematics, interval analysis, or interval computation, is a method developed by mathematicians since the 1950s and 1960s as an approach to putting bounds on rounding errors and measurement errors in mathematical computation and thus developing numerical methods that yield reliable results. Interval arithmetic helps find reliable and guaranteed solutions to equations and optimization problems.

===Methods based on real algebraic geometry===

Real algebra is the part of algebra which is relevant to real algebraic (and semialgebraic) geometry. It is mostly concerned with the study of ordered fields and ordered rings (in particular real closed fields) and their applications to the study of positive polynomials and sums-of-squares of polynomials. It can be used in convex optimization

== Stochastic methods ==
Several exact or inexact Monte-Carlo-based algorithms exist:

===Direct Monte-Carlo sampling===

In this method, random simulations are used to find an approximate solution.

Example: The traveling salesman problem is what is called a conventional optimization problem. That is, all the facts (distances between each destination point) needed to determine the optimal path to follow are known with certainty and the goal is to run through the possible travel choices to come up with the one with the lowest total distance. However, let&#x27;s assume that instead of wanting to minimize the total distance traveled to visit each desired destination, we wanted to minimize the total time needed to reach each destination. This goes beyond conventional optimization since travel time is inherently uncertain (traffic jams, time of day, etc.). As a result, to determine our optimal path we would want to use simulation - optimization to first understand the range of potential times it could take to go from one point to another (represented by a probability distribution in this case rather than a specific distance) and then optimize our travel decisions to identify the best path to follow taking that uncertainty into account.

===Stochastic tunneling===

Stochastic tunneling (STUN) is an approach to global optimization based on the Monte Carlo method-sampling of the function to be objectively minimized in which the function is nonlinearly transformed to allow for easier tunneling among regions containing function minima. Easier tunneling allows for faster exploration of sample space and faster convergence to a good solution.

===Parallel tempering===

Parallel tempering, also known as replica exchange MCMC sampling, is a simulation method aimed at improving the dynamic properties of Monte Carlo method simulations of physical systems, and of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods more generally. The replica exchange method was originally devised by Swendsen, then extended by Geyer and later developed, among others, by Giorgio Parisi.,
Sugita and Okamoto formulated a molecular dynamics version of parallel tempering: this is usually known as replica-exchange molecular dynamics or REMD.

Essentially, one runs &quot;N&quot; copies of the system, randomly initialized, at different temperatures. Then, based on the Metropolis criterion one exchanges configurations at different temperatures. The idea of this method
is to make configurations at high temperatures available to the simulations at low temperatures and vice versa.
This results in a very robust ensemble which is able to sample both low and high energy configurations.
In this way, thermodynamical properties such as the specific heat, which is in general not well computed in the canonical ensemble, can be computed with great precision.

==Heuristics and metaheuristics ==
Other approaches include heuristic strategies to search the search space in a more or less intelligent way, including:
* Ant colony optimization (ACO)
* Simulated annealing, a generic probabilistic metaheuristic
* Tabu search, an extension of local search capable of escaping from local minima
* Evolutionary algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms and evolution strategies)
* Differential evolution, a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality
* Swarm-based optimization algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization, social cognitive optimization, multi-swarm optimization and ant colony optimization)
* Memetic algorithms, combining global and local search strategies
* Reactive search optimization (i.e. integration of sub-symbolic machine learning techniques into search heuristics)
* Graduated optimization, a technique that attempts to solve a difficult optimization problem by initially solving a greatly simplified problem, and progressively transforming that problem (while optimizing) until it is equivalent to the difficult optimization problem.

<text>Dog Soldiers is a 2002 British action horror film written, directed and edited by Neil Marshall in his feature directorial debut. Starring Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Emma Cleasby and Liam Cunningham, the film follows a squad of soldiers fighting to survive an attack by a pack of werewolves during a military training exercise in the Scottish Highlands.

&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; was theatrically released in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2002. The film launched Marshall&#x27;s career as a filmmaker and received positive reviews.

==Plot==
A couple goes camping in the Scottish Highlands. The woman gives the man a silver letter opener as a present; shortly afterward they are killed in their tent by unseen assailants. Meanwhile, a soldier named Cooper runs through a forest in North Wales. He attacks his pursuers, but is overwhelmed and wrestled to the ground. It is revealed that Cooper is trying to join a special forces unit but fails when he refuses to shoot a dog in cold blood. He is returned to his unit by Captain Richard Ryan.

Four weeks later, a squad of six British soldiers, including Cooper, are dropped into a remote area of the Scottish Highlands to carry out a training exercise against a Special Air Service unit. The following morning, they find the SAS unit&#x27;s savaged remains. A badly wounded Captain Ryan, the only survivor, makes cryptic references to what attacked them. The troops retreat when unseen assailants begin pursuing them.

While retreating, Corporal Bruce is impaled by a tree branch, which kills him, and Sergeant Wells is attacked. He is rescued by Cooper and carried to a rural roadside where the group meets Megan, a zoologist who takes them to a lonely house belonging to an unknown family. Soldiers Wells, Cooper, Spoon, Joe, and Terry remain.

As darkness falls, the house is surrounded by attackers who are revealed to be werewolves. The survivors try to get in the Land Rover but find it has been destroyed by the werewolves. The soldiers maintain a desperate defence against the creatures, believing that if they can make it to sunrise, the werewolves will revert to human form.

Cooper and Megan treat Wells&#x27; wounds. After Terry is abducted and their ammunition runs short, they realize they will not be able to hold out and decide to try to escape. Spoon creates a diversion while Joe steals a Land Rover from the garage. Joe drives up to the house door, but is then killed by a werewolf that was hiding in the back seat.

Under interrogation, Ryan reveals that he was sent on a government mission to capture a live werewolf for study and exploitation as a weapon; Cooper&#x27;s squad was supposed to be the bait, and considered expendable. An enraged Wells and Cooper attempt to kill Ryan, but he transforms into a werewolf and escapes into the forest. It is revealed that the Uath family, the owners of the house, are the werewolves.

The soldiers try blowing up the barn – where Megan told them the werewolves must be hiding – using the Land Rover and petrol to create a bomb. Once the barn has been destroyed, Megan reveals that not only were there no werewolves in the barn, but she is part of the Uath family and a werewolf as well. She also reveals that she unlocked the back door to the house, allowing the other werewolves to get inside. Before she fully transforms, Wells shoots her in the head. He and Cooper run upstairs, while Spoon fights a werewolf in the kitchen. Using his surroundings to his advantage, he gains the upper hand, but is eventually killed when a second werewolf intervenes.

Wells and Cooper shoot through the floor upstairs to elude the werewolves and drop into the kitchen, where they find Spoon&#x27;s remains. As he begins to transform into a werewolf, Wells orders Cooper to take shelter in the cellar and gives him a roll of photographic film (which was in a flash camera used to stun the werewolves) to prove what has happened. The werewolves break into the kitchen and confront Wells as he cuts a gas line and blows up the house, killing the werewolves and sacrificing himself.

As the sun rises, Cooper attempts to leave, but the werewolf Ryan confronts him. After a brutal fight, Cooper stabs Ryan in the chest with the silver letter opener, weakening him enough to allow Cooper to shoot him in the head. Cooper, along with Megan&#x27;s Border Collie Sam, emerges from the cellar. Cooper&#x27;s story, with photographs, is shown reported only in a sensationalist tabloid newspaper titled &quot;Werewolves ate my platoon!&quot;, under the results of the England vs. Germany football match.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
In 1995, director Neil Marshall pitched to co-producer Keith Bell his idea of a low-budget soldiers vs. werewolves film. The filmmakers were introduced to the Victor Film Company as a sales agent, who introduced them to producer Christopher Figg. The project was later taken to AFM, where producer David E. Allen became interested in the project after seeing artwork and the script.

Production designer Simon Bowles created models of the house for Marshall to plan and structure where to set up cameras and where characters would run or climb onto the next set. For the exterior set of the house, only the front portion was built early on and is the only part used in the film.

&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; was produced by the Kismet Entertainment Group, the Noel Gay Motion Picture Company, the Victor Film Company, and the Carousel Picture Company with the support of the Luxembourg Film Fund. In addition to the credits in the infobox, the costume designer is Uli Simon, the casting directors are Jeremy Zimmerman and Andrea Clarke, the special makeup, animatronic and digital visual effects are by the company Image FX, and the physical-effects supervisor and stunt coordinator is Harry Wiessenhaan. In the United States, the film premiered as a Sci-Fi Pictures telefilm on the Sci-Fi Channel.

The film contains homages to H. G. Wells as well as the films &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;, &quot;Zulu&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;.

===Writing===
Marshall wrote the first draft in 1996. It took six years to refine the script and acquire financing. Marshall wanted the focus to be on the soldiers, with the creatures being an enemy that happens to be werewolves. Marshall wanted to avoid cliches about werewolf curses or &quot;how awful it is to be a werewolf&quot;, which Marshall felt was a trope exhaustingly used in many werewolf films.

===Filming===
Principal photography was originally scouted and planned to commence in the Isle of Man due to its tax rebates but the idea fell through. Manitoba was later considered as a filming location due to tax reasons but the idea collapsed as well. The film was shot in Luxembourg due to tax deals and having access to crew and student facilities provided by a company based in Luxembourg. Snow affected the set occasionally, which delayed filming schedules.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82%, based on 43 reviews, and an average rating of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Frightening, funny, and packed with action, &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; is well worth checking out for genre fans -- and marks writer-director Neil Marshall as a talent to keep an eye on.&quot;

Jamie Russell of the BBC gave it 4 out of 5 and called it &quot;A rip-roaring comedy action fest that&#x27;ll put hairs on your chest.&quot;
&quot;Empire magazine&quot; gave it 4 out of 5. 
Reviewing the 2020 rerelease, &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it 3 out of 5 and noted that despite the limitations of the film the talent shown by Marshall in his debut feature that &quot;You can easily draw a clear line through this to his later work&quot;. They conclude that &quot;&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; has aged pretty well.&quot; The film has since gained a cult following.

==Awards==
In 2002, the film won the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film&#x27;s Golden Raven, the festival&#x27;s top award, as well as the audience prize, the Pegasus.

==Home media==
&quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; was released on DVD in the U.S. in November 2002 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

A Blu-ray edition (including a single-disc edition and a double-disc edition with a DVD copy) was released by First Look Studios on 5 May 2009, available only in the U.S. and Canada.

Due to the low quality of the original Blu-ray transfer, Shout! Factory worked hand in hand with director Neil Marshall to create a brand-new Blu-ray transfer for &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; in a release titled &quot;Dog Soldiers: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, which was released on 23 June 2015. It was a two-disc set including a brand-new Blu-ray and a DVD copy with a new cover. This edition is only available in the U.S. (Region A). However, the original negative wasn&#x27;t located at the time of the making of this release, and Shout! Factory had to rely on two original cinema prints, whose visual qualities are limited.

On 14 March 2019, with the original negative finally located, the German company Koch Media released the movie on video in a package including the movie, restored in 4K from the negative, on DVD, Blu-ray and UHD.

Another 4K restoration was announced by Vertigo Releasing in 2020, with a digital release on 12 October 2020 and a limited edition Blu-ray was slated for release by Second Sight Films following in February 2021 but pushed back to August 2022 when access to the negative was gained and fx shots were interposed.

Second Sight released a limited edition 4K Ultra HD box set in May 2022. as well as a Standard Edition 4K UHD set and a Blu-ray release.

==Sequel==
Producer David E. Allen said in January 2004 that a sequel, &quot;Dog Soldiers: Fresh Meat&quot;, would begin a 35-day shoot that April in either Luxembourg or Canada with a budget of $5.5 million. Andy Armstrong, a second-unit director on films including &quot;&quot; and &quot;Nightbreed&quot;, would direct from an Eric Miller script, with Allen and Brian Patrick O’Toole returning as producers. No casting was announced. Allen said the plot would involve Private Cooper being &quot;picked up by an American team who, we find out, were the real opponents for the war games for Sgt. Wells&#x27; squad.&quot; A year later, he elaborated that, &quot;In the first film, it was a family who were the werewolves. In this one, it&#x27;s an actual team of werewolves who are true military men. So even though they are now werewolves, they act like a trained military unit.&quot;

In January 2005, Michael J. Bassett was in talks to direct, but by July 2006, Rob Green, who previously directed the horror film &quot;The Bunker&quot;, was set to direct and said he and Miller had written a story in which &quot;Some of the characters actually love being a werewolf because they are so powerful – the ultimate killing machine … [I]t&#x27;s a fun spin on the traditional angle that being a werewolf is a curse which damns the person no matter what. We also have a very savage she-wolf in the climax who faces against the leader of the pack of Dog Soldiers.&quot; Production was not set for autumn 2006. By 21 December 2008, however, information about the film had been removed from various web resources including the website of production company Kismet.

A &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;-inspired web series, &quot;Dog Soldiers: Legacy&quot;, was announced in September 2011 by producer and Kismet vice-president, Allen, now going by D. Eric Allen. A teaser trailer for the series was filmed in northwest Arkansas over the last weekend of August 2011. Directed by Ryan Lightbourn, the trailer included members of Allen&#x27;s family, including his grandmother Pat &quot;Nan&quot; Allen and his sister Emmy Allen, as Red. Allen also said the &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot; sequel was in early pre-production.

An early poster of &quot;Dog Soldiers: Fresh Meat&quot; was released with the tagline &quot;Coming 2014&quot; across the bottom on 23 March 2014. D. Eric Allen announced that a prequel and another sequel are in the planning stages, and &quot;Fresh Meat&quot; would be released on 20 December 2014. This date passed with no release and no additional updates on the film&#x27;s status.

Neil Marshall stated in an audio commentary for &quot;Dog Soldiers&quot;, that the moment in the film when Megan cuts her hand on a shard of glass was meant to be a setup for a second sequel about werewolf DNA, which would complete a planned trilogy. However, he added that the planned sequels will &quot;probably amount to nothing now.&quot;
