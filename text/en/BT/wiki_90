<doc id="583181" wikidata="Q16153320" url="?curid=583181" title="List of former United States counties">
<text>This is a list of former United States counties, a list of United States counties (administrative subunits of a U.S. state) that no longer exist. 

They were established by a state, provincial, colonial, or territorial government. Most of these counties were created and disbanded in the 19th century; county boundaries have changed little since 1900 in the vast majority of states. A county is repeated on the list if its jurisdiction changed from one state, colony, or territory to another.

This list includes (but is not limited to) counties that were renamed but retained their territorial integrity, or counties that were transferred wholesale to another state when it was separated from another state (Massachusetts counties transferred to Maine; Virginia counties transferred to Kentucky and West Virginia; and North Carolina counties transferred to Tennessee).

==Alabama==
* Baine County, Alabama (1866–1867, reestablished as Etowah County a year later)
* Baker County, Alabama (1868–1874, renamed Chilton County)
* Benton County, Alabama (1832–1858, named for Thomas Hart Benton, Creek War officer and U.S. Senator, renamed Calhoun County in 1858 for John C. Calhoun)
* Cahawba County, Alabama (1818–1820, renamed Bibb County)
* Cotaco County, Alabama (1818–1821, renamed Morgan County)
* Decatur County, Alabama (1821–1825, land redistributed between Madison and Jackson counties)
* Hancock County, Alabama (1850–1858, renamed Winston County)
* Jones County, Alabama (Feb–Nov 1867, area was reestablished in Oct 1868 as Sanford County and then renamed Lamar County in 1877)
* Jones County, Alabama (Aug–Oct 1868, Covington County was briefly renamed Jones County then changed back)
* Sanford County, Alabama (1868–1877, renamed Lamar County)

==Alaska==
Alaska has never created counties. Under Section 9 of the 1912 organic act creating the Territory of Alaska, Alaska was prohibited from establishing counties without explicit approval from the U.S. Congress. The framers of the Constitution of Alaska chose to forgo consideration of a county system in favor of a system of boroughs, both organized and unorganized. In 1961, the Alaska Legislature formalized the borough structure to encompass multiple, separate organized boroughs and a single unorganized borough. Alaska currently has 18 organized boroughs. The United States Census Bureau, beginning with the 1970 United States census, divided the Unorganized Borough into census areas. The boundaries of these census areas were largely based upon the early election districts of the state, which in turn were largely based upon the recording districts of the territory. Following is a list of former boroughs in Alaska:

*Chugiak–Eagle River Borough (1974–1975, incorporation invalidated by the Alaska Supreme Court)
* Greater Anchorage Area Borough (1964–1975, succeeded by Municipality of Anchorage)
* Greater Juneau Borough (1963–1970, succeeded by City and Borough of Juneau)
* Greater Sitka Borough (1963–1971, succeeded by City and Borough of Sitka)
* The Haines Borough was incorporated in 1968 as a third-class borough. Through consolidation, this municipality was dissolved, along with the City of Haines, in 2002. A home rule borough, also called the Haines Borough, was incorporated in the place of these two municipalities.
* Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (1992–2007), renamed Hoonah-Angoon Census Area after Skagway incorporated as a city-borough.
* Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon Census Area (1980–1992), renamed Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area after Yakutat incorporated as a city-borough.
* Valdez-Cordova Census Area (1980–2019), split in 2019 into Chugach Census Area and Copper River Census Area.
* Wade Hampton Census Area (1980–2015), renamed to Kusilvak Census Area.

==Arizona==
* Pah-Ute County, Arizona Territory (1865–1871) majority of the county transferred to Nevada in 1866, the remainder transferred to Mohave County

==Arkansas==
* Clayton County, Arkansas (1873–1875, renamed Clay County)
* Dorsey County, Arkansas (1873–1885, renamed Cleveland County)
* Lovely County, Arkansas Territory (1827–1828) most of the county was lost to Oklahoma due to the Cherokee Treaty of 1828, the remainder became Washington County
* Miller County, Arkansas Territory (1820–1838, became part of Indian Territory and present-day Texas)
* Sarber County, Arkansas (1871–1875, renamed Logan County)

==California==
* Branciforte County - renamed to Santa Cruz County in 1850 after less than a year of existence.
* Buena Vista County – created in 1855 by the California legislature out of the southeastern territory of Tulare County on the west of the Sierra Nevada but was never officially organized. Some of that region was later organized as Kern County in 1866, with additions from Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.
* Coso County – created in 1864 by the California legislature out of territory of Tulare County on the east slope of the Sierra Nevada but was never officially organized. The region was later organized in 1866 as Inyo County with additions from Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. 
* Klamath County – created in 1851 from the northern half of Trinity County. In 1874 it was divided between Humboldt and Siskiyou counties.
* Pautah County – created by the California legislature in 1852 out of territory the state believed would be ceded to it east of Lake Tahoe, but which was given to Nevada. The county was never officially organized.

==Colorado==
Colorado Territory was formed from the lands of four organized territories: Kansas to the southeast, New Mexico to the south, Utah to the west, and Nebraska to the northeast. Before Colorado Territory was organized, all of these except Nebraska had declared county boundaries that included part of modern-day Colorado.

===Counties formed by New Mexico Territory===
*Taos County, New Mexico Territory was originally one of the seven partidos of the Spanish, and later Mexican, province of Nuevo México. One of the nine original counties created by the U.S. Territory of New Mexico on January 29, 1852; ceased to have jurisdiction over Colorado in 1861.
*Mora County, New Mexico Territory was split from Taos County and San Miguel County on February 1, 1860, and ceased to have jurisdiction over Colorado in 1861.

===Counties formed by Utah Territory===
On March 3, 1852, the following counties were organized by Utah Territory, with boundaries reaching into what is now western Colorado:
*Great Salt Lake County
*Iron County
*Sanpete County
*Utah County
*Washington County
Upon the organization of Colorado Territory in 1861, which became law on February 28, these counties ceased to have jurisdiction in Colorado.

Green River County was also created on March 3, 1852, but never organized; it was dissolved in 1857 and recreated in 1859. After losing land to Colorado Territory in 1861 and Wyoming Territory in 1868, Green River County was finally dissolved in 1872.

Beaver County was formed on January 5, 1856 from parts of Iron and Millard counties, and like other Utah counties, ceased to have jurisdiction in Colorado.

===Counties created by Kansas Territory===
Kansas Territory&#x27;s western reaches encompassed the mining centers of Aurora and Pike&#x27;s Peak. Beginning with the massive Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory provided for a number of counties in what would become Colorado, but organized none of them before achieving statehood in 1861.

Arapahoe County was proclaimed August 25, 1855 but never organized; it reverted to unorganized territory when Kansas joined the Union on January 29, 1861. On February 7, 1859, several counties were split from Arapahoe County; none of them were organized, and also reverted to unorganized territory when Kansas became a state. They were:
*Broderick County
*El Paso County
*Fremont County
*Montana County
*Oro County

Peketon County was created on the same day in 1859, but never organized. Like Arapahoe and its daughter counties, it reverted to unorganized territory upon Kansas achieving statehood.

===Note on Nebraska Territory===
No counties were organized in Nebraska Territory&#x27;s portion of the future Colorado Territory.

===Counties created by the Provisional Territory of Jefferson===
On November 28, 1859, the Provisional General Assembly of the extralegal Territory of Jefferson established 12 counties:

*Arrappahoe County
*Cheyenne County
*El Paso County
*Fountain County
*Heele County
*Jackson County
*Jefferson County
*Montana County
*North County
*Park County
*Saratoga County
*St. Vrains County

Although it was never officially recognized by the federal government embroiled in the debate over slavery, the provisional government of the Territory of Jefferson held effective control of what became Colorado for a year and a half. Although the act establishing the Colorado Territory became law on February 28, 1861, the first Federal governor, William Gilpin, did not arrive in Denver until late May, and the Jefferson government disbanded itself on June 6, 1861. In November 1861, Colorado&#x27;s territorial legislature would establish counties of its own, with many boundaries following those of the Jefferson counties.

===Counties created by the Territory of Colorado===
*Guadalupe County, Colorado Territory (November 1–7, 1861), was one of the 17 original counties created by the Territory of Colorado. The county was renamed Conejos County after only six days.
*Greenwood County, Colorado Territory (February 11, 1870 to February 6, 1874), was created from former Cheyenne and Arapaho tribal land and the eastern portion of Huerfano County. The county was abolished four years later, and its territory split between Elbert County and Bent County.
*Platte County, Colorado Territory (February 9, 1872 to February 9, 1874), was created from the eastern portion of Weld County. The county was abolished two years later after organizers failed to secure voter approval, and the territory of the county was returned to Weld County.

===Counties created by the State of Colorado===
*Carbonate County, Colorado (February 8–10, 1879). Lake County was renamed Carbonate County in 1879. Only two days later, Carbonate County was split into the new Chaffee County and a reestablished Lake County.
*Uncompaghre County, Colorado (February 27 to March 2, 1883). Ouray County was renamed Uncompaghre County for only four days in 1883.
*South Arapahoe County, Colorado (November 15, 1902, to April 11, 1903), was one of three counties created from Arapahoe County in 1902. The name was changed back to Arapahoe County after five months.

==Connecticut==
* Westmoreland County, Connecticut (see Pennamite–Yankee War and State of Westmoreland)

==Delaware==

*Kent County, Delaware was formerly known as St. Jones County.
*Sussex County, Delaware was formerly known as Deale County.

==District of Columbia==
The United States Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget currently consider the District of Columbia to consist of a single county equivalent. Otherwise the District of Columbia currently has no counties or county equivalents. The former counties of the District of Columbia are:
* Alexandria County, D.C. (1791–1846) retroceded to Virginia becoming Alexandria County, Virginia.
* Washington County, D.C. Abolished in 1871 and consolidated with the District of Columbia. Under the current (2001, revised through 2005) District of Columbia Code, the entire District of Columbia is a single body corporate for district purposes; the code does not mention Washington County except to make the District of Columbia the successor in title to its property.

Georgetown City and Washington City are former county equivalents. The District of Columbia comprised three county equivalents when it was consolidated in 1871: Georgetown City, Washington City, and the Remainder of the District—as they are termed in the &quot;Ninth Census of the United States&quot; (1870). There had been four county equivalents in the District prior to the retrocession of Alexandria to Virginia in 1846. In its retrospective decennial population counts the &quot;Ninth Census&quot; lists four for 1840 back to 1810, Alexandria and Washington counties alone for 1800, and none for 1790 prior to the creation of the district.

==Florida==
* Benton County, Florida, named for Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton in 1844, renamed Hernando County in 1850
* Fayette County, Florida became parts of Jackson, Calhoun and Gulf counties in 1833
* Mosquito County, Florida renamed Orange County, Florida in 1845.
* New River County, Florida renamed Bradford County, Florida in 1861.

==Georgia==
* Bourbon County, Georgia (organized by Georgia in 1785 out of disputed Yazoo lands in present-day Mississippi; dissolved in 1788)
* Campbell County, Georgia (1828–1931); merged with Fulton County
* Cass County, Georgia (1832–1861); renamed Bartow County
* Kinchafoonee County, Georgia (1853–1856); renamed Webster County
* Milton County, Georgia (1857–1931); merged with Fulton County
* Walton County (1803–1818); merged with Buncombe County, North Carolina

==Idaho==
* Alturas County, Idaho (1864–1895) reduced greatly in size at creation of Elmore County and Logan County in 1889. In 1891, an attempt was made to transfer to Alta County, declared unconstitutional. Transferred to Blaine County in 1895 
* Lah-Toh County, Idaho Territory (1864–1867) absorbed by Nez Perce and Kootenai County.
* Logan County, Idaho (1889–1895) In 1891, an attempt was made to transfer territory to Lincoln County and Alta County. Act declared unconstitutional. In 1895, the Idaho Legislature combined Logan and Alturas Counties into a new county called Blaine
* Alta County created from Alturas in 1891, Act declared unconstitutional in May, 1891.

==Illinois==

===Revolutionary era===
* Illinois County, Virginia, formed in 1778 to govern Virginia&#x27;s claims to present-day Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota; county abolished 5 January 1782; territory ceded by Virginia to Congress in March 1784. Its effective reach was limited to the French settlements at Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Vincennes.

===Former counties of the Northwest and Indiana territories===
Before Illinois Territory was created in 1809, it was part of the Northwest Territory from 1788 to 1800, and Indiana Territory from 1800 to 1809. At first, two counties of the Northwest Territory were created to govern what became the modern state of Illinois, followed by two others:
* St. Clair County, Northwest Territory established April 27, 1790, later St. Clair County, Indiana Territory; upon the organization of Indiana Territory in 1800, St. Clair County was enlarged to take in present-day Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, and the western portion of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. When Illinois Territory was set off from the Indiana Territory in 1809, St. Clair County was included in the new government.
* Knox County, Northwest Territory, established June 20, 1790, later Knox County, Indiana Territory, 1800; its boundaries in 1795 included the eastern half of the future state of Illinois. Portions of Knox County would be transferred to Michigan Territory upon its organization in 1805 and to Illinois Territory upon its organization in 1809; the remainder was included in the state of Indiana upon its achieving statehood in 1816.
* Randolph County, Northwest Territory, proclaimed 1795, from part of St. Clair County; transferred to Indiana Territory in 1800 and Illinois Territory in 1809, now Randolph County, Illinois.
* Wayne County, Northwest Territory, proclaimed on August 15, 1796 following the British evacuation of Detroit; out of portions of Hamilton County, Northwest Territory and unorganized land, mostly in the present-day Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This first Wayne County originally included a slice of the present Lake Michigan shoreline of Illinois, the site of present-day Chicago; its lands would be transferred to Knox County, Indiana Territory and later, the Illinois Territory. Transferred to Indiana Territory in 1803 and to Michigan Territory in 1805.

===Counties organized by Illinois Territory===
Other counties were organized by the Illinois Territory from the lands of St. Clair County between 1812 and 1819 and notionally included parts of the future Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin territories in their boundaries:
* Madison County, Illinois Territory, 1813, from St. Clair
* Edwards County, Illinois Territory, 1815, from Madison
* Crawford County, Illinois Territory, 1816, from Edwards
* Bond County, Illinois Territory, 1817, from Madison

Before Illinois achieved statehood in 1818, the part of Illinois Territory excluded from the new state (Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, and the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan) was transferred to Michigan Territory. No county governments were included in this transfer.

==Indiana==

===Revolutionary era===
* Illinois County, Virginia, formed in 1778 to govern Virginia&#x27;s claims to present-day Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota; county abolished 5 January 1782; territory ceded by Virginia to Congress in March 1784. Its effective reach was limited to the French settlements at Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Vincennes.

===Former counties of the Northwest and Indiana territories===
Indiana Territory was created in 1800, and had since 1788 been part of the Northwest Territory; the new territory included modern-day Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota, as well at the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At first, one county of the Northwest Territory had been created to govern what became the modern state of Indiana, and three others would be included in the Indiana Territory:
* Knox County, Northwest Territory, established June 20, 1790, later Knox County, Indiana Territory, 1800; its boundaries in 1795 included the eastern half of the future state of Illinois, and its 1800 boundaries included the western half of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula. The northern portions of Knox County would be transferred to Michigan Territory upon its organization in 1805, and the westernmost to Illinois Territory upon its organization in 1809; the remainder was included in the state of Indiana upon its achieving statehood in 1816. The county&#x27;s current form is that of Knox County, Indiana.
* St. Clair County, Northwest Territory established April 27, 1790, later St. Clair County, Indiana Territory; upon the organization of Indiana Territory in 1800, St. Clair County was included in the new territory and enlarged to take in present-day Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota, and the western portion of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. When Illinois Territory was set off from the Indiana Territory in 1809, St. Clair County was included in the new government.
* Randolph County, Northwest Territory, proclaimed 1795, from part of St. Clair County; transferred to Indiana Territory in 1800 and Illinois Territory in 1809, now Randolph County, Illinois.
* Wayne County, Northwest Territory, proclaimed on August 15, 1796 following the British evacuation of Detroit; out of portions of Hamilton County, Northwest Territory and unorganized land, mostly in the present-day Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This first Wayne County originally included a slice of northern Indiana; all of Wayne County west of the present Indiana–Ohio line was transferred to Knox County, Indiana Territory in 1800. After losing other lands to the new state of Ohio, the remaining portion of Wayne County was transferred to Indiana Territory in 1803 and to Michigan Territory in 1805. The current Wayne County, Michigan is considered a successor of the 1796 establishment.

Throughout this time, Detroit and Fort St. Joseph (present-day Niles, Michigan) were occupied by British forces, and Virginia&#x27;s jurisdiction in the region was therefore limited to the French settlements of Cahokia, Kaskaskia and Vincennes, far to the south of Michigan.

===Former counties of the Northwest, Indiana and Illinois territories===
* Wayne County, Northwest Territory, proclaimed on August 15, 1796 following the British evacuation of Detroit; out of portions of Hamilton County, Northwest Territory and unorganized land. This first Wayne County originally encompassed all of Michigan&#x27;s Lower Peninsula, including northwestern Ohio, northern Indiana, and a small portion of the present Lake Michigan shoreline of Illinois, the site of present-day Chicago. In 1800, the area west of the extension of the present Indiana–Ohio border became part of Knox County, Indiana Territory, and a section in the east of the county&#x27;s Ohio lands was included as part of the new Trumbull County. This first Wayne County was split upon Ohio&#x27;s achievement of statehood in 1803; north of the Ordinance Line became part of Indiana Territory as a reorganized Wayne County; the county&#x27;s remaining lands in Ohio briefly reverted to an unorganized status.
* Wayne County, Indiana Territory, established 1803 as a revival of the former county government, and included in Michigan Territory upon its creation in 1805.
* Knox County, Indiana Territory, established as Knox County, Northwest Territory in 1790; upon the organization of Indiana Territory, Knox County was enlarged to take in the western side of the Lower Peninsula and a large slice of the Upper Peninsula. It is unknown if Knox County ever exercised jurisdiction over its lands in the future Michigan.
* St. Clair County, Indiana Territory, established as St. Clair County, Northwest Territory in 1790; upon the organization of Indiana Territory, St. Clair County was enlarged to take in the western portion of the Upper Peninsula. When Illinois Territory was set off from the Indiana Territory in 1809, St. Clair County was included in the new government. It can be presumed that this St. Clair County never exercised jurisdiction over its share of the future Michigan, due to the lack of non-native settlers.

Other counties organized by the Illinois Territory between 1809 and 1819, including Madison, Crawford, Bond, and Edwards, notionally included parts of the future Michigan and Wisconsin territories in their boundaries, but do not appear to have exercised jurisdiction north of the current state line.

===Former districts of Michigan Territory===
The first governor of Michigan Territory, William Hull, declared a county government into existence shortly after assuming power in 1805, but on the same day, ordered that four districts be organized:
* District of Detroit, the area surrounding the settlement at Detroit; in practice, this district was combined with the Huron district.
* District of Erie, the area south of the Huron River and centered on present-day Monroe
* District of Huron, the area north of Detroit, encompassing today&#x27;s Thumb (Michigan) and Mid-Michigan
* District of Michilimackinac, centered on the Straits of Mackinac and covering the northern half of the Lower Peninsula

Judicial acts and militia organization took place at the district level; the vestigial county government was never organized. District government lapsed after the British occupation of Detroit and Mackinac in 1812; following the recapture of Detroit in 1813, Hull&#x27;s replacement as governor (by American reckoning), Lewis Cass, abolished the district scheme. In 1815, the current Wayne County was organized; the county government traces its lineage to the 1796 county of that name.

<doc id="583187" wikidata="Q4993209" url="?curid=583187" title="Jesus H. Christ">
<text>Jesus H. Christ is an expletive interjection that refers to the Christian religious figure of Jesus. It is typically uttered in anger, surprise, or frustration; although often with humorous intent. 

== History ==
The earliest use of the phrase is unknown, but in his autobiography, Mark Twain (1835–1910) observed that it was in general use even in his childhood. Twain refers to an episode from 1847, when he was working as a printer&#x27;s apprentice; Roger Smith (1994) tells the tale thus:

[Twain] recounts a practical joke a friend played on a revival preacher when Twain was an apprentice in a printing shop that Alexander Campbell, a famous evangelist then visiting Hannibal, hired to print a pamphlet of his sermon. While checking the galleys, Twain&#x27;s fellow apprentice, Wales McCormick, found he had to make room for some dropped words, which he managed by shortening Jesus Christ on the same line to J. C. As soon as Campbell had read the proofs, he swept indignantly into the shop and commanded McCormick, &quot;So long as you live, don&#x27;t you ever diminish the Savior&#x27;s name again. Put it all in.&quot; The puckish McCormick obeyed, and then some: he set Jesus H. Christ and printed up all the pamphlets.

Roger Smith suggests that &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot; is a specifically American profanity, and indicates that at least in his experience it is uttered primarily by men. British writer Michael Quinion likewise specifies the phrase as belonging to American English.

== Stress pattern ==
Multiple authors emphasize the practice of placing a strong stress on the &quot;H&quot;, relating it in various ways to expletive infixation. Thus Quinion writes:

Its long survival must have a lot to do with its cadence, and the way that an especially strong stress can be placed on the H. You might also think of it as an example of emphatic infixing that loosely fits the models of words like &quot;abso-bloody-lutely&quot; or &quot;tribu-bloody-lation&quot;.

Similar remarks were made by the linguist Dwight Bolinger, who mentions &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot; in a discussion of the strategies used by English speakers to add additional stresses to &quot;highly charged words&quot; for purposes of emphasis. Horberry suggests &quot;The strong emphasis on the H somehow improves the rhythm of its host phrase.&quot; The &quot;Green&#x27;s Dictionary of Slang&quot; says &quot;the H is redundant other than for rhythm&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Using the name of Jesus Christ as an oath has been common for many centuries, but the precise origins of the letter H in the expression are obscure. While many explanations have been proposed, the most widely accepted derivation is from the divine monogram of Christian symbolism. The symbol, derived from the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus (), is transliterated iota-eta-sigma, which can look like IHS, (with lunate sigma), JHS or JHC (&quot;J&quot; was historically a mere variant of &quot;I&quot;).

For how this learned-sounding abbreviation could have served as the basis for vulgar slang, Smith offers the hypothesis that it was noticed by ordinary people when it was worn as a decoration on the vestments of Anglican (i.e., in America, Episcopal) clergy. The &quot;JHC&quot; variant would particularly invite interpretation of the &quot;H&quot; as part of a name.

=== False etymology ===
While the above is the most likely origin of the &quot;H&quot;, there are other popular false etymologies. One commonly held origin is as an initial for the name &quot;Harold&quot;, which is mentioned by Smith as the basis of a variant form, &quot;Jesus Harold Christ&quot;. The &quot;Harold&quot; may arise from a common misinterpretation (often by children) of the phrase in the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, &quot;Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.&quot; This phrase can be mistakenly interpreted as specifying the name of the Deity (&quot;thy name is ... &quot;), rather than the true reading, which is &quot;may thy name be hallowed&quot;. The confusion would arise from the phonetic similarity of &quot;hallowed&quot; ( [ˈhæloʊd]) to &quot;Harold&quot; (IPA [ˈhærəld]).

=== Facetious etymology ===
In a joke made by biology students, the H is said to stand for &quot;Haploid&quot;; the implication being that since by the doctrine of the Virgin birth Jesus had no biological father, his genome would have been inherited entirely from his mother, the Virgin Mary. For the scientific background of the joke see Ploidy.

== Variants ==
The number of variant forms, usually with &quot;H&quot; replaced by something longer, is vast. In addition to the folk etymology of Jesus Harold Christ, Smith lists Jesus Holy Christ, Jesus Hecking Christ, and Jesus H. Particular Christ. &quot;Green&#x27;s Dictionary of Slang&quot; lists Jesus H!, Jesus H. Johnson!, Jesus H. Mahogany Christ!, Jesus Christ!, Christ!, Jesus J Christ!, and Judas H. Christ!.

For Smith, the very presence of so many spelled-out variants is part of the humor—and blasphemy—inherent in &quot;Jesus H. Christ&quot;. He suggests that the H offers &quot;the power of taking the Lord&#x27;s name in vain by adding something to it that the imagination is invited to complete: What does the H. stand for? — whatever the errant imagination proposes and the imaginer is disposed to enjoy.&quot;

==Offensive status and blasphemy==
The term is considered offensive by some, most notably within Christianity, where most denominations view Jesus as part of the Trinity and consubstantial with God. Thus, saying the name &quot;Jesus (H.) Christ&quot; can be taken as a form of contempt or disrespect for God and a form of blasphemy. More specifically, the interjection is considered by some to be a violation of the commandment, &quot;Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain&quot;.

<text>Wendell Hampton Ford (September 8, 1924 – January 22, 2015) was an American politician from Kentucky. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as Governor of Kentucky from 1971 to 1974, and as a member of the United States Senate for 24 years from 1974 to 1999. He was the first person to be successively elected lieutenant governor, governor, and United States senator in Kentucky history. He was the Senate Democratic whip from 1991 to 1999, and was considered the leader of the state&#x27;s Democratic Party from his election as governor in 1971 until he retired from the Senate in 1999. At the time of his retirement he was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky&#x27;s history, a mark which was then surpassed by Mitch McConnell in 2009. Ford is the last Democrat to have served as a Senator from the state of Kentucky.

Born in Daviess County, Kentucky, Ford attended the University of Kentucky, but his studies were interrupted by his service in World War II. After the war, he graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance and returned to Kentucky to help his father with the family insurance business. He also continued his military service in the Kentucky Army National Guard. He worked on the gubernatorial campaign of Bert Combs in 1959 and became Combs&#x27; executive assistant when Combs was elected governor. Encouraged to run for the Kentucky Senate by Combs&#x27; ally and successor, Ned Breathitt, Ford won the seat and served one four-year term before running for lieutenant governor in 1967. He was elected on a split ticket with Republican Louie Nunn. Four years later, Ford defeated Combs in an upset in the Democratic primary en route to the governorship.

As governor, Ford made the government more efficient by reorganizing and consolidating some departments in the executive branch. He raised revenue for the state through a severance tax on coal and enacted reforms to the educational system. He purged most of the Republicans from statewide office, including helping Walter Dee Huddleston win the Senate seat vacated by the retirement of Republican stalwart John Sherman Cooper. In 1974, Ford himself ousted the other incumbent senator, Republican Marlow Cook. Following the rapid rise of Ford and many of his political allies, he and his lieutenant governor, Julian Carroll, were investigated on charges of political corruption, but a grand jury refused to indict them. As a senator, Ford was a staunch defender of Kentucky&#x27;s tobacco industry. He also formed the Senate National Guard Caucus with Republican U.S. Senator Kit Bond of Missouri. Chosen as Democratic party whip in 1991, Ford considered running for floor leader in 1994 before throwing his support to U.S. senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut. He retired from the Senate in 1999 and returned to Owensboro, where he taught politics to youth at the Owensboro Museum of Science and History.

==Early life==
Wendell Ford was born near Owensboro, in Daviess County, Kentucky, on September 8, 1924. He was the son of Ernest M. and Irene Woolfork (Schenk) Ford. His father was a state senator and ally of Kentucky Governor Earle C. Clements. Ford obtained his early education in the public schools of Daviess County and graduated from Daviess County High School. From 1942 to 1943, he attended the University of Kentucky.

On September 18, 1943, Ford married Ruby Jean Neel (1924 - living) of Owensboro at the home of the bride&#x27;s parents. The couple had two children. Daughter Shirley (Ford) Dexter was born in 1950 and son Steven Ford was born in 1954. The family attended First Baptist Church in Owensboro.

In 1944, Ford left the University of Kentucky to join the army, enlisting for service in World War II on July 22, 1944. He was trained as an administrative non-commissioned officer and promoted to the rank of technical sergeant on November 17, 1945. Over the course of his service, he received the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal and earned the Expert Infantryman Badge and Good Conduct Medal. He was honorably discharged on June 18, 1946.

Following the war, Ford returned home to work with his father in the family insurance business, and graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance in 1947. On June 7, 1949, he enlisted in the Kentucky Army National Guard and was assigned to Company I of the 149th Infantry Regimental Combat Team in Owensboro. On August 7, 1949, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant of Infantry. In 1949, Ford&#x27;s company was converted from infantry to tanks, and Ford served as a Company Commander in the 240th Tank Battalion. Promoted to First Lieutenant of Armor, he transferred to the inactive Guard in 1956, before being discharged in 1962.

==Political career==
Ford was very active in civic affairs, becoming the first Kentuckian to serve as president of the Jaycees in 1954. He was a youth chairman of Bert T. Combs&#x27; 1959 gubernatorial campaign. After Combs&#x27; election, Ford served as Combs&#x27; executive assistant from 1959 to 1963. When his mother died in 1963, Ford returned to Owensboro to help his father with the family insurance agency. Although it was speculated he would run for lieutenant governor that year, Ford later insisted he had decided not to re-enter politics until Governor Ned Breathitt asked him to run against Casper &quot;Cap&quot; Gardner, the state senate&#x27;s majority leader and a major obstacle to Breathitt&#x27;s progressive legislative agenda. Ford won the 1965 election by only 305 votes but quickly became a key player in the state senate. Representing the Eighth District, including Daviess and Hancock counties, Ford introduced 22 major pieces of legislation that became law during his single term in the senate.

In 1967, Ford ran for lieutenant governor, this time against the wishes of Breathitt and Combs, whose pick was state attorney general Robert Matthews. Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total vote count in the primary. He ran an independent campaign and won in the general election even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn. Republicans and Democrats split the state offices, with five going to Republicans and four going to Democrats.

During his time as lieutenant governor, Ford rebuilt the state&#x27;s Democratic machine, which would help elect him and others, including Senator Walter Huddleston and Governor Martha Layne Collins. When Governor Nunn asked the legislature to increase the state sales tax in 1968 from 3 percent to 5 percent, Ford opposed the measure, saying it should only pass if food and medicine were exempted. Ford lost this battle; the increase passed without exemptions. From 1970 to 1971, Ford was a member of the executive committee of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors. While lieutenant governor, he became an honorary member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity in 1969.

===Governor of Kentucky===
At the expiration of his term as lieutenant governor, Ford was one of eight candidates to enter the 1971 Democratic gubernatorial primary. The favorite of the field was Ford&#x27;s mentor, Combs. During the campaign, Ford attacked Combs on the grounds of age and the sales tax enacted during Combs&#x27; administration. He also questioned why Combs would leave his better-paying federal judgeship to run for a second term as governor. Ford garnered more votes than Combs and the other six candidates combined, and attributed his unlikely win over Combs in the primary to superior strategy and Combs&#x27; underestimation of his candidacy. Following the election, Combs correctly predicted &quot;This is the end of the road for me politically.&quot;

Ford went on to win the governorship in a four-way general election that included another former Democratic governor, A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, who ran as an independent. Ford finished more than 58,000 votes ahead of his closest rival, Republican Tom Emberton. With Combs and Chandler both out of politics, factionalism in the Kentucky Democratic Party began to wane.

As governor, Ford raised revenue from a severance tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, and an increased corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state&#x27;s criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.

Ford oversaw the transition of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state&#x27;s education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state&#x27;s colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state&#x27;s education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure that would have allowed collective bargaining for teachers.

Ford drew praise for his attention to the mundane task of improving the efficiency and organization of executive departments, creating several &quot;super cabinets&quot; under which many departments were consolidated. During the 1972 legislative session, he created the Department of Finance and Administration, combining the functions of the Kentucky Program Development Office and the Department of Finance. Constitutional limits sometimes prevented him from combining like functions, but Ford made the reorganization a top priority and realized some savings to the state.

On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its ruling in the case of &quot;Dunn v. Blumstein&quot; that found that a citizen who had lived in a state for 30 days was resident in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky&#x27;s Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly&#x27;s agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.

Despite surgery for a brain aneurysm in June 1972, Ford attended the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. He supported Edmund Muskie for president, but later greeted nominee George McGovern when he visited Kentucky. The convention was the beginning of Ford&#x27;s role in national politics. Offended by the McGovern campaign&#x27;s treatment of Democratic finance chairman Robert Schwarz Strauss, he helped Strauss get elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee following McGovern&#x27;s defeat. As a result of his involvement in Strauss&#x27;s election, Ford was elected chair of the Democratic Governors&#x27; Conference from 1973 to 1974. He also served as vice-chair of the Conference&#x27;s Natural Resources and Environmental Management Committee.

During the 1974 legislative session, Ford proposed a six-year study of coal liquefaction and gasification in response to the 1973 oil crisis. He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by the merit examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.

Ford united the state&#x27;s Democratic Party, allowing them to capture a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1972 for the first time since 1956. The seat was vacated by the retirement of Republican John Sherman Cooper and won by Ford&#x27;s campaign manager, Walter Dee Huddleston. Ford&#x27;s friends then began lobbying him to try and unseat Kentucky&#x27;s other Republican senator, one-term legislator Marlow Cook. Ford wanted lieutenant governor Julian Carroll, who had run on an informal slate with Combs in the 1971 primary, to run for Cook&#x27;s seat, but Carroll already had his eye on the governor&#x27;s chair. Ford&#x27;s allies did not have a gubernatorial candidate stronger than Carroll, and when a poll showed that Ford was the only Democrat who could defeat Cook, he agreed to run, announcing his candidacy immediately following the 1974 legislative session.

A primary issue during the election was the construction of a dam on the Red River. Cook opposed the dam, but Ford supported it and allocated some of the state&#x27;s budget surplus to its construction. In the election, Ford defeated Cook by a vote of 399,406 to 328,982, completing his revitalization of the state&#x27;s Democratic party by personally ousting the last Republican from major office. Cook resigned his seat in December so that Ford would have a higher standing in seniority in the Senate. Ford resigned as governor to accept the seat, leaving the governorship to Carroll, who dropped state support for the project, killing it.

In the wake of the rapid ascent of Ford and members of his faction to the state&#x27;s major political offices, he and Carroll were investigated in a corruption probe. The four-year investigation began in 1977 and focused on a state insurance kickback scheme alleged to have operated during Ford&#x27;s tenure. In June 1972, Ford had purchased insurance policies for state workers from some of his political backers without competitive bidding. State law did not require competitive bidding, and earlier governors had engaged in similar practices. Investigators believed there was an arrangement in which insurance companies getting government contracts split commissions with party officials, although Ford was suspected of allowing the practice for political benefit rather than personal financial gain. In 1981, prosecutors asked for indictments against Ford and Carroll on racketeering charges, but a grand jury refused. Because grand jury proceedings are secret, what exactly occurred has never been publicly revealed. However, state Republicans maintained that Ford took the Fifth Amendment while on the stand, invoking his right against self-incrimination. Ford refused to confirm or deny this report. A federal grand jury recommended that Ford be indicted in connection with the insurance scheme, but the U.S. Department of Justice did not act on this recommendation.

Ford entered the Senate in 1974 and was reelected in 1980, 1986 and 1992. In the 1980 primary, Ford received only token opposition from attorney Flora Stuart. He was unopposed in the 1986 and 1992 Democratic primaries. Republicans failed to put forward a viable challenger during any of Ford&#x27;s re-election bids. In 1980, he defeated septuagenarian former state auditor Mary Louise Foust by 334,862 votes. Ford&#x27;s 720,891 votes represented 65 percent of the total votes cast in the election, a record for a statewide race in Kentucky. Against Republican Jackson Andrews IV in 1986, Ford shattered that record, securing 74 percent of the votes cast and carrying all 120 Kentucky counties. State senator David L. Williams fared little better in 1992, surrendering 477,002 votes to Ford (63 percent).

Ford seriously considered leaving the Senate and running for governor again in 1983 and 1991, but decided against it both times. In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford&#x27;s, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.

Early in his career, Ford supported a constitutional amendment against desegregation busing. He also floated a proposal to put the federal budget on a two-year cycle, believing too much time was spent annually on budget wrangling. This idea, based on the model used in the Kentucky state budget, was never implemented. During the Ninety-fifth Congress (1977–1979), he was chairman of the Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences.

From 1977 to 1983, Ford was a member of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California&#x27;s Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a &quot;New York Times&quot; writer opined that he overestimated his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston&#x27;s withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported Christopher Dodd for majority leader.

During the Ninety-eighth Congress (1983–1985), Ford served on the Select Committee to Study the Committee System, and he was a member of the Committee on Rules and Administration in the One Hundredth through One Hundred Third Congresses (1987–1995). In 1989, he joined with Missouri senator Kit Bond to form the Senate National Guard Caucus, a coalition of senators committed to advancing National Guard capabilities and readiness. Ford said he was motivated to form the caucus after seeing the work done by Mississippi Representative Sonny Montgomery with the National Guard Association and the National Guard Bureau. Ford co-chaired the caucus with Bond until Ford&#x27;s retirement from the Senate in 1999. The Kentucky Army Guard dedicated the Wendell H. Ford Training Center in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky in 1998. In 1999, the National Guard Bureau presented Ford with the Sonny Montgomery Award, its highest honor.

Missouri senator Thomas Eagleton opined that Ford and Dee Huddleston made &quot;probably the best one-two combination for any state in the Senate.&quot; Both were defenders of tobacco, Kentucky&#x27;s primary cash crop. Ford sat on the Commerce Committee, influencing legislation affecting the manufacturing end of the tobacco industry, while Huddleston sat on the Agriculture Committee and protected programs that benefited tobacco farmers. Both were instrumental in salvaging the Tobacco Price Support Program. Ford got tobacco exempted from the Consumer Product Safety Act and was a consistent opponent of cigarette tax increases. He sponsored an amendment to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that limited the amount of foreign tobacco that could be imported by the United States.

Later in his career, Ford split with Huddleston&#x27;s successor, Mitch McConnell, over a proposed settlement of lawsuits against tobacco companies. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, which would have protected the price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco farmers and an end to the price support program. Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.

As chairman of the Commerce Committee&#x27;s aviation subcommittee, Ford secured funds to improve the airports in Louisville, northern Kentucky, and Glasgow. The Wendell H. Ford Airport in Hazard, Kentucky is named for him. A 1990 bill aimed at reducing aircraft noise, improving airline safety measures, and requiring airlines to better inform consumers about their performance was dubbed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century.

Of his career in the Senate, Ford said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t interested in national issues. I was interested in Kentucky issues.&quot; Nevertheless, he influenced several important pieces of federal legislation. He sponsored an amendment to the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 exempting businesses with fewer than fifty employees. He was a key player in securing passage of the motor voter law in 1993. He supported increases to the federal minimum wage and a 1996 welfare reform bill. A supporter of research into clean coal technology, he also worked with U.S. senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia to secure better retirement benefits for coal miners. Never known as a major player on international issues, Ford favored continued economic sanctions against Iraq as an alternative to the Gulf War. He voted against the Panama Canal Treaty, which he perceived to be unpopular with Kentucky voters. Despite having chaired Bill Clinton&#x27;s inaugural committee in 1993, Ford broke with the administration by voting against the North American Free Trade Agreement .

As he had as governor of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the United States Congressional Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government millions of dollars in printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, U.S. senator John Warner of Virginia sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the United States Congressional Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and the administrator of the United States Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, and the bill was not re-introduced.

==Later life, illness and death==
Ford chose not to seek a fifth term in 1998, and retired to Owensboro. In 1998 he was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership. He worked for a time as a consultant to Washington lobbying and law firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin &amp; Oshinsky. At the time of his retirement, Ford was the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history. In January 2009, Mitch McConnell surpassed Ford&#x27;s mark of 24 years in the Senate.

In August 1978, the US 60 bypass around Owensboro was renamed the Wendell H. Ford Expressway. The Western Kentucky Parkway was also renamed the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway during the administration of Governor Paul E. Patton. In 2009, Ford was inducted into the Kentucky Transportation Hall of Fame.

Later in life, Ford taught politics to the youth of Owensboro from the Owensboro Museum of Science and History, which houses a replica of his Senate office.

On July 19, 2014, the &quot;Messenger-Inquirer&quot; reported that Ford had been diagnosed with lung cancer.

Ford died from lung cancer at his home on January 22, 2015, at age 90. He was buried at Rosehill Elmwood Cemetery.

<text>Simon Philip Raymonde (born 3 April 1962) is an English musician and record producer. He is the son of the late arranger and composer Ivor Raymonde. He is best known as the bass guitarist and keyboard player with the Scottish band Cocteau Twins from 1983 to 1997.

Raymonde now runs the Bella Union record label and management company Bella Union Artist Management.

Raymonde has acted as producer and mixer on many records, including Clearlake&#x27;s &quot;Cedars&quot;, James Yorkston&#x27;s &quot;Moving Up Country&quot;, the first two albums by John Grant&#x27;s first band the Czars, three albums by the Duke Spirit including the hit album &quot;Cuts Across the Land&quot;, Archie Bronson Outfit&#x27;s &quot;Kangaroo Heart&quot;, Anthony Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Just So You Know&quot; and the Open&#x27;s &quot;Silent Hours&quot;. He co-produced the posthumous album from Billy Mackenzie. He also mixed the Fionn Regan album &quot;The End of History&quot;, which was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Music Prize, and the album &quot;The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads&quot; by Lift to Experience. Raymonde remixed tracks for Archive, Tristeza and Departure Lounge.

Raymonde&#x27;s memoir &quot;In One Ear: Cocteau Twins, Ivor Raymonde and Me&quot; was released on 12 September 2024.

== Career ==

Raymonde began his career as bassist for London-based post-punk band Drowning Craze, who released three singles on Situation 2: &quot;Storage Case&quot; (1981), &quot;Trance&quot; (1981) and &quot;Heat&quot; (1982).

In 1984, Raymonde joined Cocteau Twins, filling the void left by the departed bassist Will Heggie. He remained as a core writer in the band until its dissolution in 1997. As well as his work with Cocteau Twins, he also contributed to the first two albums by This Mortal Coil, another 4AD project.

Raymonde&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Blame Someone Else&quot;, was released on 6 October 1997, and featured Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins. In 2007, he made an appearance in the documentary film &quot;Scott Walker: 30 Century Man&quot;. In 2009, Raymonde formed the group Snowbird with Stephanie Dosen.

Bella Union was named the Best Independent Label of the Year in 2010, as voted by the UK&#x27;s indie retailers, and later won this award again in 2012, 2014 and 2016.

In 2011, he was asked to be the music supervisor for Jonathan Caouette&#x27;s documentary &quot;Walk Away Renee&quot;, which was accepted for the Cannes Film Festival and released in May 2013.

In 2012, Bella Union celebrated its 15th year, and the label was asked to host and curate the Friday line-up at the End of the Road Festival that September.

Between 2012–2015, Raymonde presented a show on Amazing Radio on Monday evenings, and has stood in for John Kennedy on his &quot;Xposure&quot; show on Radio X.

He was vice-chairman of the board at the Association of Independent Music in 2013, and has spoken regularly around the world about his experiences in the industry. He presented a weekend workshop with music students at QUT in Brisbane, and has also done master classes at Middlesex University, BIMM and the Academy of Contemporary Music at UCO in Oklahoma City. He served as the keynote speaker at Big Sound in Australia, Going Global in New Zealand and Norwich&#x27;s Sound &amp; Vision (where he was interviewed by John Robb).

On 27 January 2014, he released his first music in 17 years, with the band Snowbird. Their album &quot;Moon&quot; was issued as a vinyl package with one black vinyl and one white vinyl, with artwork designed by Vaughan Oliver and a bonus electronic dub remix album by RxGibbs called &quot;Luna&quot;.

In summer 2015, he started a new musical project with musician Richard Thomas (formerly of Dif Juz and the Jesus and Mary Chain), called Lost Horizons. Their album, &quot;Ojalá&quot;, was released on Bella Union in November 2017. The album was named Rough Trade &quot;Album of the Month&quot;; following this, the band were invited by Perfume Genius to be part of the Le Guess Who festival in Utrecht.

In 2018, Bella Union released two double albums celebrating the work of Raymonde&#x27;s late father, Ivor, who worked with the Walker Brothers, David Bowie, Tom Jones and Dusty Springfield, among others.

In 2018, Simon and his wife, Abbey Raymonde, started the management side of Bella Union, working with Brighton-based Penelope Isles. In March 2022, Bella Union celebrated its 25th anniversary in Austin at SXSW festival with around 15 bands performing across two stages at the legendary MOHAWK venue, then in May 2022 Simon and his fellow Cocteau Twins Elizabeth and Robin received an Ivors Academy&#x27;s Visionary Award. In 2023, the &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; LP received the SAY (Scottish Album Of The Year) Award for Classic Album.

<text>Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Limited (VSEL) was a shipbuilding company based at Barrow-in-Furness, England that built warships, civilian ships, submarines and armaments. The company was historically the Naval Construction Works of Vickers Armstrongs and has a heritage of building large naval warships and armaments. Through a complicated history the company&#x27;s shipbuilding division is now BAE Systems Submarine Solutions and the armaments division is now part of BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments.

==History==

The company was founded in 1871 by James Ramsden as the Iron Shipbuilding Company, but its name was soon changed to Barrow Shipbuilding Company.

In 1897, Vickers &amp; Sons bought the Barrow Shipbuilding Company and its subsidiary the Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, becoming Vickers, Sons and Maxim Limited. The shipyard at Barrow became the Naval Construction &amp; Armaments Company. In 1911 the company was renamed Vickers Limited, and in 1927 became Vickers Armstrongs Limited after a merger with Armstrong Whitworth, whose shipyard at High Walker on the River Tyne became the &quot;Naval Yard&quot;.

In 1955 the name of the shipbuilding division changed to Vickers Armstrongs Shipbuilders, Ltd and changed again in 1968 to Vickers Limited Shipbuilding Group.

The shipbuilding group was nationalised under the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act in 1977 and subsumed into British Shipbuilders.

The ex-Vickers yard at Barrow was the first shipyard of the British Shipbuilders group to return to the private sector. It was sold in March 1986 to an employee-led company, VSEL Consortium, which also included its Birkenhead-based subsidiary, Cammell Laird. The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in December 1986.
In 1988, a mistake by senior management and changing shipbuilding methods meant that the Vickers shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness accidentally welded part of (a nuclear submarine) in an upside-down position.

In 1994 VSEL was subject to two takeover proposals, one from GEC and another from British Aerospace (BAe). VSEL was willing to participate in a merger with a larger company to reduce its exposure to cycles in warship production, particularly following the Options for Change defence review after the end of the Cold War. Both bids were referred to the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission (MMC) which issued its conclusions and advice to government in May 1995. BAe&#x27;s bid was approved, while the MMC concluded (with two of six members dissenting) that GEC&#x27;s bid was likely to &quot;operate against the public interest&quot;. However it was GEC&#x27;s bid that was approved and accepted by VSEL, since Secretary of State Michael Heseltine did not accept the MMC&#x27;s recommendation and allowed the bid to proceed.

Following GEC&#x27;s purchase VSEL became Marconi Marine (VSEL), part of the company&#x27;s GEC-Marconi division. With the merger of British Aerospace and GEC&#x27;s defence business – Marconi Electronic Systems – VSEL passed to the resulting company, BAE Systems as part of BAE Systems Marine. In 2003 it became an independent division known as BAE Systems Submarines after BAE systems split its ship and submarine building operations. This was renamed BAE Systems Submarine Solutions in January 2007.

<doc id="583210" wikidata="Q16952548" url="?curid=583210" title="Crazylegs Classic">
<text>The Crazylegs Classic is an annual running race and walk held each spring in Madison, Wisconsin in the United States. The course starts at the Library Mall at the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus and ends at the Kohl Center. The race, first held in 1982, was named in honor of Elroy &quot;Crazylegs&quot; Hirsch. Proceeds from the race benefit University of Wisconsin–Madison athletics programs.

The idea for the race was hatched in late 1981 by Tom Grantham, Ken Sparks, and Rich Backus, who wanted to raise money to support Wisconsin athletics. As admirers of Hirsch, who was then serving as UW–Madison&#x27;s athletic director, they asked his permission to name it the &quot;Crazylegs Run&quot; in his honor. Grantham continues to serve as general chairman on the Crazylegs Classic Executive Committee. Hirsch greeted runners at the start and finish of the race between 1981 and 1996.

The first race in 1982 attracted 1,525 runners and raised $9,500. The event grew in popularity and the walk was added in 1987 with 676 walkers the first year. The event has grown, reaching a record high of 20,445 registrants in 2010. Since its inaugural race, it has attracted more than 229,000 runners and walkers.

&quot;Runner&#x27;s World&quot; magazine has rated the Crazylegs Classic as one of America&#x27;s Best 100 Events. Readers participating in the &quot;Capital Times&quot;/&quot;Wisconsin State Journal&quot; Reader&#x27;s Choice Award survey have voted the classic the #1 Favorite Local Running Event every year since 1995.

In 2002, the Road Runners Club of America chose the Crazylegs Classic one of twenty &quot;Great Races! Great Places!&quot; events.

The race starts at the Library Mall on the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus and ends at the Kohl Center.

Prior to 2019, the Crazylegs Classic started opposite the State Capitol Building, going down Wisconsin Avenue, moving onto the campus over Observatory Drive to Picnic Point and returning down University Avenue to Camp Randall where it ended at the 50 yard line. The route change was the result of Madison Common Council implementing new rules for street use permits in downtown Madison.

The Crazylegs Classic has experienced suboptimal weather conditions. In 1988, racers fast sleet and high winds. In 1994, Madison received snow on race day. And in 2019, Madison received snow.

In 1995, University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor David Ward ordered the Crazylegs Classic course to be rerouted given other events taking place on campus. It was the first time in 14 years the course had been changed and the first time the Observatory Drive Hill was not part of the course.

The race was canceled in 2020 and was run as a virtual race in 2021 as a result of COVID-19.

The Crazylegs Classic has honored notable individuals by having them serve as grand marshal for the race, including:
*1995, college American football coach Barry Alvarez
*2000, University of Wisconsin Marching Band director Michael Leckrone
*2001, Wisconsin Alumni Association director Arlie Mucks

<text>The Fernmeldeturm Nürnberg, the tallest structure in Bavaria, is a telecommunication tower in Nuremberg, southern Germany. Also called the &quot;Nürnberger Ei&quot; (&quot;Egg of Nuremberg&quot;) because of its egg-shaped tower basket in a height of 185 metres, it is 292 metres high and was built between 1977 and 1980 according to blueprints by architect Erwin Heinle.

The tower basket accommodates transmission mechanisms for Frequency modulation, DAB, UMTS, pager, amateur radio and a microwave radio relay link and – closed since 1991 – a rotating restaurant and a prospect platform. Responsible operator is the DFMG Deutsche Funkturm (German radio tower) GmbH, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom based in Münster. From 22 January 2003 to 4 April 2003 the Nürnberg telecommunication tower also served for the spreading of the program of megaradio on mediumwave frequency 945 kHz. For this a wire antenna was strung along the tower shaft, from the top of the tower to the roof of an operating building near the tower.

Since July 2009 a 360° Panoramacamera shows the view over Nuremberg from 194 metres.

==Forerunner==
From 1927 to 1969, broadcasting programs in medium wave were emitted by the Transmitter Nuremberg-Kleinreuth at the former Rundfunkstraße (Broadcast street) 24. This transmitter was laid to the radio emitting station of the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting Company) on 15 September 1969 on the Dillberg mountain (see: Dillberg transmitter) where the broadcasting programs of the Bavarian Broadcasting Company are still emitted.

<text>Dragon Tales is an animated educational fantasy children&#x27;s television series created by Jim Coane and Ron Rodecker, developed by Coane, Wesley Eure, Jeffrey Scott, Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, and produced by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop), Columbia TriStar Television (now known as Sony Pictures Television) and Adelaide Productions. The series focuses on the adventures of two siblings, Emmy and Max, and their dragon friends Cassie, Ord, and Zak and Wheezie.

The series began broadcasting on PBS on their newly-renamed PBS Kids block on September 6, 1999, with its final episode airing on October 31, 2005. The show aired reruns on the PBS Kids block (and sister channel PBS Kids Sprout) up until August 31, 2010, when it was dropped entirely from the lineup. Yearim Productions was responsible for the animation for all seasons (Sunwoo Entertainment and Wang Film Productions only did animation for season 1), with the exception of Koko Enterprises, which recorded the show along with BLT Productions. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the United States Department of Education, cereal company Kellogg&#x27;s and greeting card manufacturer, American Greetings were responsible for funding.

==Premise and overview==
The series focuses on the adventures of six-year-old Emmy and four-year-old Max, two Mexican-American human siblings. Upon moving into their new house, they find an enchanted dragon scale which, upon reciting a special rhyme, can magically transport them to Dragon Land, a whimsical fantasy world inhabited by many colorful dragons. Befriended by four dragons with distinctive personalities – the very shy, yet intelligent and sweet-natured Cassie; the very strong, yet fearful Ord; and polar opposite conjoined twins, neat-freak Zak and rambunctious Wheezie – Emmy and Max frequently travel to Dragon Land and help their friends in fulfilling particular quests, assisting them in their daily problems, and learning important morals through their experiences in Dragon Land. At the end of each episode, Emmy and Max hold hands and recite another special rhyme to return to Earth.

The dragons also each have their own dragon badges worn around their necks that glow when they accomplish something they usually have trouble with. For example, Cassie&#x27;s glows when she overcomes her anxiety, Ord&#x27;s glows whenever he faces his fears, and Zak and Wheezie&#x27;s glow when they overcome their differences and work together.

To educate preschoolers mildly about Hispanic and Latino culture, a new character named Enrique was introduced during the show&#x27;s third and final season, providing the series with a third protagonist. Surrounded by a variety of unique characters and faced with numerous differing situations, Emmy and Max commonly embark on adventures with their dragon friends, conquering fears or achieving goals despite any obstacles along the way.

As a series broadcast on PBS, the program has an educational focus, combining lessons of a pro-social nature with those of more general educational value. Educational themes covered included identifying shapes, learning words and letters in both English and Spanish, counting, and basic math. Social themes are also covered, such as good sportsmanship, the importance of being a good friend, overcoming obstacles such as jealousy or fears, and getting along with siblings. Many of the show&#x27;s interstitial song segments, known as &quot;Dragon Tunes,&quot; also covered such themes, such as &quot;Make It Fun&quot;, which encourages viewers to not complain about having to do seemingly mundane chores such as washing dishes or helping parents with cooking meals, but instead, find ways to make them fun; and &quot;Hum,&quot; which encourages those who had a fear of the dark or trying new things to hum softly to comfort themselves. Three stated goals of the program&#x27;s educational philosophy are the encouragement of pursuing new experiences, finding ways to approach and learn from challenges, and that learning can come through trying and not succeeding entirely. Despite two of the show&#x27;s human leads, Emmy and Enrique, being six and eight years old, the show&#x27;s described target audience was children closer to the age of four.

Another key topic of the program is the encouragement of honest expressions of emotion. In &quot;Cassie, the Green-Eyed Dragon,&quot; Cassie feels jealous of her little brother, Finn, who gets everyone&#x27;s attention when she takes him to school for &quot;circle time.&quot; Discussing the matter with her best friend, Emmy, and her teacher, Quetzal, helps her to understand that jealousy is a natural feeling that everyone experiences sometimes, but that there are ways that she can appreciate her brother, while still feeling appreciated herself. In &quot;Feliz Cumpleaños, Enrique,&quot; Enrique feels sad and homesick for his homeland of Colombia when his birthday celebrations in Dragon Land are not like the traditions of those back in his old home. He talks with Quetzal, who encourages him to cry, even though he had been told that crying was something a boy at his age was not supposed to do. After doing so, he feels better and can enjoy his party celebrations.

As with &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, which is also produced by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop), the program&#x27;s creators encourage &quot;co-viewing,&quot; the practice of parents or other caregivers watching the program along with their children and engaging in activities such as discussion, singing and dancing, and pretend play. The program&#x27;s official website offers several activities and lesson plans to aid in these efforts.

* Finn (voiced by Ellen Kennedy) is Cassie&#x27;s younger brother. He is light blue, toddler-aged, loves his blankie, and is only just learning to fly. He is prone to throw tantrums when he gets upset.
* The Giant of Nod (voiced by Blu Mankuma in his first appearance and Paul Dobson in &quot;Much Ado About Nodlings&quot; onwards) is the leader of a group of gnome-like creatures called the Nodlings. Despite being no bigger than 12 inches, he is considered a giant due to him being bigger in comparison to the tiny Nodlings.
* Princess Kidoodle is the ruler of the Doodle Fairy Kingdom. She seems to be much older than any other doodle fairies.
* Kiki (voiced by Ellen Kennedy) is Cassie&#x27;s baby sister. She is mint green, wears diapers, drinks from a baby bottle and loves playing with her &quot;Squishy&quot;.
* Lorca (voiced by Lenore Zann) is a disabled dragon and Max, Emmy, Zak, Wheezie, Ord and Cassie&#x27;s friend. He was born without wings and has to use a wheelchair because he was born this way and is incapable of flight.

* Polly Nimbus (voiced by Kathleen Barr) is the operator of the cloud factory, which controls Dragon Land&#x27;s weather. 
* Priscilla (voiced by Erin Fitzgerald) is the manager at the Lost and Not-Yet-Found, who during her first appearance, was feeling very embarrassed because her wings that looked like feathers were much bigger than those of other dragons. She eventually realized that there is nothing wrong with being different when she uses her big wings to help Mungus clean up his castle in a &quot;different&quot; way.
* Sid Sycamore (voiced by Scott McNeil) is a talking tree who loves telling jokes that relate to the concept of trees.
* Spike (voiced by Danny McKinnon) is a brief student who loves his yo-yo but he can also act as a mean bully whenever he gets upset or lonely. He is paired up with Cassie when the group picks Dragon Plums. He bullies Cassie and when she gets upset about this, Quetzal advises her to be friends with Spike. Because Quetzal implied that Spike might only be a bully because he is upset and alone, much like how Cassie shrinks when she is shy, scared, or upset.
* Windy (voiced by Erin Fitzgerald in Season 1 and Maggie Blue O&#x27;Hara in Seasons 2-3) is a little wind who likes to blow like her father.
* Wyatt (voiced by Doug Parker) is a talking wishing well that immediately grants any wish for a single coin. He&#x27;s old friends with Quetzal.
* Emmy and Max&#x27;s Mom (voiced by Kathleen Barr) &amp; Dad (voiced by Eli Gabay), who occasionally speak off-screen.

==Episodes==

&quot;Dragon Tales&quot; aired a total of 94 episodes, 40 in its first season, 24 in its second season, and 30 in its third season. Each episode featured two original stories, aired back-to-back, split by the interstitial song segment &quot;Dragon Tunes,&quot; all of which were eventually released on the show&#x27;s music albums. Almost all episodes from the third season, however, generally contained at least one repeat of a story from the program&#x27;s second season (As evidenced by the absence of Enrique.) and some were even repeats of material from that season and earlier material from the third season. In all, there were a total of 155 original stories. The show also had one special: &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Band&quot;, released in 2003, was a musical feature in which the characters of the show were seen alongside real human children.

== Development ==
&quot;Dragon Tales&quot; is based on characters created in 1978 by Laguna Beach, California artist and retired educator Ron Rodecker. Rodecker was recovering from a coronary artery bypass graft when he began sketching dragons as a means of symbolizing forces in life that were too big to control. In 1995, Jim Coane, then a producer at Columbia TriStar Television, found the artwork and developed it into a television series with several writers. The project was considered something of a risky venture because it was not based on a well-known franchise like many children&#x27;s television programs, such as &quot;Arthur&quot; or &quot;Paddington Bear&quot;. The series was immediately shipped to PBS member stations at the suggestion of PBS, but all originally passed at the time. 

In October 1995, Jim Coane met Marjorie Kalins, senior VP of programming and production at Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, and showed her the idea for the series. Kalins, who loved the idea, brought the series to Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, which agreed to a partnership with the Columbia TriStar Television Group. Kalins helped him and Columbia TriStar Television obtain an $8.5 million grant from the Department of Education and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The grant proposal was written by former &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; cast member and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; host Wesley Eure. Coane stated that there was never any consideration of trying to shop the program to a commercial broadcast network and that PBS was, in his mind, the only destination for the program. As Columbia TriStar was the TV division of two major Hollywood film studios, which in turn are owned by the Sony Pictures Entertainment division of Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony, &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; became one of the few PBS Kids and Sprout programs to be co-produced by a major Hollywood studio&#x27;s TV subsidiary; The other PBS shows were &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; (made by Walt Disney Television), and &quot;Curious George&quot; (produced by Universal Television). In 2002, CTTV was renamed to Sony Pictures Television, a company that would co-produce the third season of the program.

After a tour of the lot of Sony Pictures Studios, Wesley Eure created the first treatment of the show, including the initial conception of the two-headed dragon Zak and Wheezie, back then known as &quot;Snarf and Bugger.&quot; The series received a massive multi-million dollar grant from the federal government, beating out &quot;The Muppets&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot; for the request. As part of the conditions for the grant, Eure was required to create a companion series for the program, which he titled &quot;Show and Tell Me&quot;, based on his own lecture series known as &quot;Anyone Can Write a Book.&quot; Though the companion series was never actually created, Eure remains hopeful that it will one day be produced. Eure&#x27;s name was not included in the initial credits for the series, forcing him to hire an attorney to ensure that he received credit.

Following the development of a show bible by Jeffrey Scott, with some tweaks by writers Cliff Ruby and Elana Lesser, the series was ordered for just over 60 eleven-minute episodes by PBS. Scott was assigned to write and edit half, with Ruby/Lesser assigned to the other half. At this point, the writing team was provided with a document titled &quot;FUN AND LEARNING IN DRAGON LAND: A Writer&#x27;s Guide to Dragon Tales Educational Content&quot; which provided directives as to which curriculum should be included within the stories, such as &quot;emotional challenges &gt; understanding other people&#x27;s emotions &gt; recognizing and labeling feelings in others&quot; and the statement that &quot;CURRICULUM IS PARAMOUNT!&quot; 

After the creation of the first script, all writing parties involved agreed that the scripts &quot;weren&#x27;t fun or funny, they were flat and boring.&quot; The writers successfully explained to the consultants, educators, and psychologists of PBS that children watch television to be entertained and must be entertained to be educated. They were then provided with a new directive, &quot;Come up with entertaining stories and shoehorn in the curriculum wherever it fits!&quot; Scott states that from the experience he learned an invaluable lesson about how to create a successful preschool series. Dong Woo Animation, Rough Draft Korea, Sunwoo Entertainment, Wang Film Productions (season 1 only), Yearim, Siriol Productions (season 3 only) and Lotto Animation contributed the animation for this series. &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; is one of the last major animation productions in the West to use cel animation (in season 1 only; the series switched to digital ink and paint in season 2).

==Broadcast history==
=== Telecast ===
&quot;Dragon Tales&quot; premiered on PBS Kids on September 6, 1999, with the episode &quot;To Fly with Dragons/The Forest of Darkness&quot;. The installment introduced the characters of Max and Emmy to Dragon Land after discovering a magical dragon scale in their new home and to their new dragon friends. In the first half, they discovered Ord&#x27;s missing tooth, while the adventures continued in the second story with Ord facing his fear of the dark. A total of forty episodes were aired in the first season, with the finale airing on April 28, 2000. The show also aired on the original PBS Kids Channel until that network&#x27;s closure in 2005. &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; was the only CTW show airing on the PBS Kids Channel due to competing network Noggin having the cable rights to air shows from the CTW&#x27;s programming library (including its flagship series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;). 

The show&#x27;s second season premiered on June 4, 2001, and had 25 episodes. 20 of these episodes were broadcast from June 4, 2001 to September 14, 2001. The final installment of this set, &quot;Just the Two of Us/Cowboy Max,&quot; was broadcast only in non-U.S. markets such as Guam and Canada and did not premiere to U.S. audiences until the program&#x27;s third season, though &quot;Cowboy Max&quot; was released on DVD prior to this. Following this, no new episodes were aired until February 21, 2005, leading many long-time viewers to believe the program had been quietly canceled. 

The third season introduced the new character Enrique, an immigrant from Colombia, as well as an updated focus on folk songs and teaching of Spanish. The premiere installment, in two parts, showed Enrique being introduced to the sights and sounds of Dragon Land, learning to fly on Zak &amp; Wheezie, and having his first adventure. The second half noticeably appeared as &quot;The Mystery of the Missing Knuckerholes&quot; in some listings, but on the program was simply titled as Part 2 of the episode. Though 29 episodes were broadcast, including &quot;Just the Two of Us/Cowboy Max,&quot; only one story from each was original, while the others were a repeat of a story from the second season. 

The series officially concluded on April 11, 2005 with segments &quot;Flip Flop&quot; and a repeat of &quot;Just For Laughs&quot; from the second season. &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; would continue to air in reruns on the PBS Kids block (and its sister channel PBS Kids Sprout) until August 31, 2010.

The program&#x27;s first musical album, &quot;Dragon Tunes&quot;, was released on March 20, 2001 and featured the character themes of Cassie and Ord, as well as tunes such as &quot;Betcha Can,&quot; the &quot;Wiggle Song&quot; and &quot;Shake Your Dragon Tail.&quot; A second album, &quot;More Dragon Tunes&quot;, was issued on February 15, 2005. This album introduced the character theme of Zak &amp; Wheezie, as well as a number of new tunes introduced in the program&#x27;s second and third seasons, including &quot;Hola,&quot; &quot;When You Make a New Friend&quot; and remixes of two previous themes, &quot;Shake Your Dragon Tail&quot; and &quot;Dance.&quot;

=== Other media ===
Throughout its history, a number of tie-in book releases were printed, some based on installments of the television program, others not. These included &quot;Cassie Loves a Parade&quot;, &quot;Ord Makes a Wish&quot; and &quot;Taking Care of Quetzal&quot;.

A special, &quot;Parent Tales from Dragon Tales&quot;, was produced in association with the program. The program was stated to use &quot;messages built into the children&#x27;s series to inform parental challenges. From bedtime dramatics to tantrums and assorted other small-fry rebellions...&quot; For the special, parents were given video cameras used to record problematic behavior, then counselors analyzed the video footage and provided specific tips to the parents, who all reported significantly improved behavior two months later. The researchers also discovered from their work on the series that children often think in pictures and that visual aids are often helpful.

A direct-to-video special, &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Band!&quot;, featuring the dragon characters blended with live humans in a musical show based on the program&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Tunes&quot; segments, was released on March 2, 2003.

&quot;Dragon Tales&quot; featured an original score composed by Jim Latham and Brian Garland. Each episode also included an interstitial segment between story airings known as &quot;Dragon Tunes,&quot; featuring a song either based on one of the characters of the show, or designed to teach a lesson, such as &quot;Stretch!&quot;, which encouraged viewers to reach forward for their goals and &quot;When You Make a New Friend,&quot; which espoused the joys of forming a new friendship. The songs were released on the albums &quot;Dragon Tunes&quot; and &quot;More Dragon Tunes&quot;.

==Reception==
The series has received generally positive reviews, though its third season received mixed reception due to the introduction of Enrique. Common Sense Media rated the show a four out of five stars, stating: &quot;&quot;Dragon Tales&quot; intends to positively impact a child&#x27;s growth and development by encouraging a love of learning and helping children problem-solve and work through the challenges of growing up. The kids and dragons embark on different adventures and attend the School in the Sky, all while learning how to face their fears and handle new situations. The fun, nurturing, and sometimes challenging atmosphere of Dragon Land is a lot like preschool.&quot;

===Awards===
* 2000 Parents&#x27; Choice Silver Award Winner
* 2001 Parents&#x27; Choice Approved Award Winner (for &quot;Dragon Tales: Dragon Tunes&quot; CD)
* 2003 Parents&#x27; Choice Silver Award Winner (for &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Band&quot; video)
* 2005 Parents&#x27; Choice Approved Award Winner (for &quot;Dragon Tales: More Dragon Tunes&quot; CD)

The series was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Animated Program in 2001, 2002 and 2003, but did not win any. Jason Michas and Kathleen Barr also received Annie Award nominations in 2000 for their performances of Zak and Wheezie respectively.

=== Video games ===
On November 29, 2000, a video game based on the series, &quot;Dragon Tales: Dragon Seek&quot;, was released for the PlayStation. Published by NewKidCo, the player takes control of either Emmy or Max as the player navigates them through Dragon Land playing hide and seek, searching for either Ord, Cassie, Zak and Wheezie, Monsieur Marmaduke or Captain Scallywag that are hiding in certain areas in each level, the player would also have a choice to pick what character they want to search for at the beginning.

On December 16, 2000, another video game, &quot;Dragon Tales: Dragon Wings&quot;, was issued for Game Boy Color. Issued by NewKidCo, the game allowed players to take on the role of a novice dragon that was learning the secrets of flight at Quetzal&#x27;s School in the Sky. Players moved through 15 levels of obstacles available in three difficulty levels. Reviews were mixed at Amazon.com, with an overall rating of 3/5 stars from ten reviewers. Many praised the graphics and fun of the game, but also felt that the game was too challenging for most younger players and did not offer much educational value.

On July 28, 2001, a third video game titled &quot;Dragon Tales: Dragon Adventures&quot; was released for Game Boy Color. Also issued by NewKidCo, the game included journeys to familiar locations from the show including the Stickleback Mountains, the Singing Springs and Crystal Caverns. The game included multiple skill settings and the option to play as Cassie, Ord, Emmy or Max, the title having been issued before the addition of Enrique to the series. A Game Boy Advance port of the game, issued by Global Star Software, was released on June 21, 2004, which also makes Zak and Wheezie playable in that version.

The show&#x27;s official website also included a number of tie-in games, such as &quot;Finn&#x27;s Word Game&quot; and &quot;Dragonberry Surprise,&quot; though following the discontinuation of the site, such titles are no longer available.

In October 2004, &quot;Scholastic Parent &amp; Child&quot; selected the CD-ROM game &quot;Learn &amp; Fly With Dragons&quot; as teachers&#x27; pick for best new tech.

===Marketing and merchandise===
In addition to the various books, music albums and video game releases, numerous merchandise items featuring the characters of &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; were made available for purchase throughout the program&#x27;s run. A total of six different designs featuring scenes from the program were featured on Welch&#x27;s jam jars. An official board game for the series titled &quot;Dragon Tales: A Dragon Land Adventure&quot;, featured obstacles and memory games, with the goal of completing a puzzle. It was released by University Games and overall reviews were generally positive, though also expressed that the game was not very challenging. Other merchandise released for the series included plush toys for most of the major characters, such as Cassie and Quetzal though Enrique, seen only in the program&#x27;s third season, was never released in plush form and was largely absent from merchandise releases. As early as January 1996, Hasbro reached an agreement for a line of plush, puzzles and board games related to the series to be released beginning in spring 2000.

For the program&#x27;s video debut, multiple licensees, including Hasbro, Random House, Sony PlayStation and New Kid Toys promoted in tandem a &quot;Dragon Tales Family Fun Getaway.&quot; Promoted via stickers on &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; merchandise and home video releases, the promotion was a contest with a grand prize of a four-day, three-night trip for four to San Diego, including a visit to the San Diego Zoo.

In 2001, Mott&#x27;s ran a five-month &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; promotion with its apple juice packs. &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; character stickers were offered on 50 million packs. Additionally, 20 million bottles offered an instant win game with the top prize as a &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; themed party with the pink dragon Cassie and an additional 10,000 prizes of &quot;Dragon Tales&quot; books.

===Live events===
A musical stage show called &quot;Dragon Tales Live!&quot; features the characters and concepts of the show. It toured nationally in the United States. It featured performers playing the dragons in full body costumes and two real children in each production playing the roles of Max and Emmy. Shows included the &quot;Missing Music Mystery&quot;, &quot;Journey to Crystal Cave&quot; and &quot;The Riddle of Rainbow River.&quot;

&quot;Dragon Tales Live!&quot; toured from January 2002 until at least March 2006. The program was never modified to include the character of Enrique, who was not added until the program&#x27;s final season, one year before productions of the stage show ended.

<text>Angela Maria &quot;Geli&quot; Raubal (; 4 June 1908 – 18 September 1931) was an Austrian woman who was the half-niece of Adolf Hitler. Born in Linz, Austria-Hungary, she was the second child and eldest daughter of Leo Raubal Sr. and Hitler&#x27;s half-sister, Angela Raubal. Raubal lived in close contact with her half-uncle Adolf from 1925 until her presumed suicide in 1931.
== Life ==
Angela Maria &quot;Geli&quot; Raubal was born in Linz, Austria-Hungary on 4 June 1908, where she was raised with her brother Leo and sister Elfriede. Her father died at the age of 31 when Geli was two. She and Elfriede accompanied their mother when she became Hitler&#x27;s housekeeper in 1925; Raubal was 17 at the time and spent the next six years in close contact with her half-uncle, who was 19 years her senior. Her mother was given a position as housekeeper at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden in 1928. Raubal moved into Hitler&#x27;s Munich apartment in 1929 when she enrolled in medicine at Ludwig Maximilian University but she did not complete her studies.

As Hitler rose to power as leader of the Nazi Party, he was domineering and possessive of Raubal, keeping control of her. When he discovered in December 1927 that she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced her to end the affair and dismissed Maurice from his service. After that he did not allow her to associate with friends and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the cinema and to the opera.

== Death ==
Raubal was living in Hitler&#x27;s Munich apartment, and he maintained strict control over her actions. She was in effect a prisoner, and planned to escape to Vienna to continue her singing lessons. Her mother told interrogators after the war that Hitler had forbidden her daughter to continue her relationship with a man from Linz whom she was hoping to marry. Hitler and Raubal argued on 18 September 1931 when he refused to allow her to go to Vienna. He departed for a meeting in Nuremberg but was recalled to Munich the next day with the news that Raubal was dead from a gunshot wound to the lung; she had apparently shot herself in Hitler&#x27;s Munich apartment with Hitler&#x27;s Walther pistol. She was 23.

Rumours immediately began in the media about physical abuse, a possible sexual relationship, an infatuation by Raubal for her uncle, and even murder. The &quot;Münchener Post&quot; reported that the dead woman had a fractured nose and other serious injuries. Otto Strasser, a political opponent of Hitler, was the source of some of the more sensational stories. The historian Ian Kershaw maintains that &quot;whether actively sexual or not, Hitler&#x27;s behaviour towards Geli has all the traits of a strong, latent at least, sexual dependence.&quot; The police ruled out foul play and the death was ruled a suicide. Hitler was devastated and went into an intense depression. He moved to a house on the shores of the Tegernsee and did not attend the funeral in Vienna on 24 September. He visited her grave at Vienna&#x27;s Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) two days later. Thereafter, he overcame his depression and refocused on politics.

Hitler later declared that Raubal was the only woman he had ever loved, according to American historian William L. Shirer. Her room at Haus Wachenfeld was kept as she had left it, and he hung portraits of her in his room there and at the Reich Chancellery in Berlin.

In a 1992 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, Ron Rosenbaum examines several theories, including speculation that Hitler intentionally or accidentally shot and killed Raubal during an argument, or that she was killed on his orders. According to her cousin William Stuart-Houston, Hitler&#x27;s nephew through his half-brother, Alois, &quot;When I visited Berlin in 1931, the family was in trouble. ... Everyone knew that Hitler and she had long been intimate and that she had been expecting a child – a fact that enraged Hitler.&quot;

In 2017, he joined the Indian National Congress and was elected to the Punjab Legislative Assembly from Amritsar East. He lost in 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election from Amritsar East Assembly constituency.

As a professional cricketer, Sidhu had a career spanning over 19 years after his first-class debut in 1981–82. After losing his place in the national team following his international debut in 1983–84, he returned to score four half-centuries in the 1987 World Cup. Playing mostly as a top-order batter, Sidhu went on to play in 51 Tests and 136 One-Day-Internationals for his country. He came to be known for his six-hitting ability and earned the sobriquet &quot;Sixer Sidhu&quot;. He was part of the Indian squads that won the 1988 Asia Cup, the 1990-91 Asia Cup and the 1995 Asia Cup and semi finalists in the 1987 Cricket World Cup and 1996 Cricket World Cup.

After retirement, he turned to commentary and television, most notably as a judge of comedy shows, and as a permanent guest in &quot;Comedy Nights with Kapil&quot; (2013–2015) and later &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot; (2016–2019). He was a contestant in the reality television show &quot;Bigg Boss&quot; (2012) and was seen in the show &quot;Kyaa Hoga Nimmo Kaa&quot;.

In May 2022, the Supreme Court of India convicted him of voluntarily causing hurt (Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code) and sentenced him to 1 year rigorous imprisonment. He was released after serving nearly 10 months of his sentence at Patiala Jail.

==Early life and biography==

He is also the present president of World Jat Aryan Foundation. He is a vegetarian.

He is married to Navjot Kaur Sidhu, a doctor and a former member of Punjab Legislative Assembly.

==Personal life==
Former Pakistani cricketer and prime minister Imran Khan is one of his good friends. Many times opposition politicians have criticised Sidhu for nepotism. Fellow players from his cricketing career call him by his pet name Sherry.

==Cricket career==
===Failure on debut and success at World Cup (1987)===
Sidhu made his first-class debut in November 1981 playing for Punjab against Services in Amritsar. Opening the innings, he made 51 before he was run out, as his team won the match by an innings. He was called up to the Indian Test team in November 1983 after he scored a century (122) for the North Zone playing against the touring West Indies team the previous month. He was drafted to the Test team as a replacement to an injured Dilip Vengsarkar for the Third Test in Ahmedabad. He scored 20 runs in 90 minutes before he was booed out of the ground upon dismissal. After another modest score in the final Test in Madras (now Chennai), he was dropped from the team.

Sidhu was recalled to the national team only four years later, for the World Cup. Making his One Day International (ODI) debut against Australia in the first of the group stage games, he made a 79-ball 73, an innings that included five sixes and four fours. India went on to lose the match by a single run. After the game, Australia&#x27;s captain Allan Border had remarked: &quot;When the bloke hits the ball, it stays hit.&quot; In India&#x27;s next game, against New Zealand, Sidhu scored a match-winning knock of 75, hitting four sixes and fours each, helping his team record its first win against them in World Cups. Sidhu scored two more successive fifties, against Australia and Zimbabwe (51 and 55 respectively), and in the process, became the first player to record four successive half-centuries on debut in ODIs. He carried his fine form into the Asia Cup the following year helping his team regain the trophy. He scored a half-century in the opening match against hosts Bangladesh before making another in the final (76 off 87 balls), receiving man of the match awards for both performances. He finished the tournament scoring three fifties in four innings aggregating to 179 runs and was named man of the tournament.

===Return to Test team===
Sidhu made his return to the Test side after five years, replacing Mohinder Amarnath, with a century in first innings of the Bangalore Test against New Zealand in November 1988. Batting for 295 minutes, he made 116 in 195 balls, an innings that included four sixes and 12 fours, punishing mostly the spinners, before he followed it up with an unbeaten 43 in the second innings, helping his team win by 172 runs. His second Test century came in the Fourth Test of India&#x27;s Caribbean Tour later that season. He made 116 while opening the innings retiring hurt 30 minutes before end of play on day one after suffering from cramp in the legs. &quot;Wisden&quot; wrote, &quot;Batting securely despite obvious flaws in technique, he reached his century in 324 minutes, off 216 balls, and hit eight fours.&quot; The innings was considered one of his best considering that the Sabina Park wicket was among the fastest in the world. He totalled 179 runs at an average of 29.83 for the series.

Touring Pakistan in 1989–90, Sidhu averaged 38.42 in four Tests, with his best performance coming in the Fourth test in Sialkot. He rescued India in their second innings when down 38/4 putting together a century stand with Sachin Tendulkar while making 97. He was named man of the match. Sidhu injured his wrist in the First Test of India&#x27;s tour of New Zealand later that season, while facing an aggressive spell of fast bowling by Danny Morrison, ruling him out of the series. He had a poor tour of England and Australia averaging 11.20 and 20.40, totaling 56 and 102 runs respectively, both three-Test series. After poor performances at the domestic level, he was omitted from the 16-member side that was selected to tour South Africa starting October 1992. Ajay Jadeja replaced him in the squad.

Sidhu was recalled when England toured India later that season. He made his third Test hundred in the Second Test in Madras, scoring 106 off 273 balls while opening the innings. He struck a partnership with Tendulkar who made 165 taking their team to 560 before declaration. India went on to win the match and the series. Sidhu particularly attacked spinner John Emburey in his innings that included nine fours. He aggregated 235 in the series at 58.75. Sidhu was India&#x27;s best performer in the ODI series that followed, scoring 287 runs at 57.40. He played two match-winning knocks: a 76 in Chandigarh followed by an unbeaten 134 in Gwalior. He received man of the match awards for both performances. The latter innings followed after India were down having lost two wickets with 4 runs on the board. Sidhu put together a 175-run stand with Mohammad Azharuddin for the third wicket. En route to his century, Sidhu passed 2,000 runs in ODIs. After India&#x27;s series-leveling victory in the final game, Sidhu was given the man of the series award.

His first ODI century came against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1989 while his 134 against England at Gwalior in 1993 was his highest ODI score and the innings which he called his best when he retired in 1999. Sidhu told in an interview that an article criticising his dismal performance changed his cricketing life.
After a string of poor performances in 1983, Rajan Bala, a noted cricket columnist, wrote an article on him titled &quot;Sidhu: The Strokeless Wonder&quot; in the &quot;Indian Express&quot;. It was an epiphany that changed his life and he started taking his cricketing career seriously.

After his improved performance in 1987 World Cup, the same columnist wrote an article titled &quot;Sidhu: From Strokeless Wonder To A Palm-Grove Hitter&quot;, applauding his performance.

Sidhu scored over 500 Test runs in a year thrice (1993, 1994 and 1997). His only Test double century came during India&#x27;s 1997 tour of the West Indies. In 1994, he scored 884 ODI runs. Sidhu was the first Indian batsman to score more than 5 centuries in one day internationals.
===201 against the West Indies and retirement===
Sidhu walked out of India&#x27;s 1996 tour of England citing differences with captain Mohammad Azharuddin. Following this, he was banished from the team for ten Tests by the BCCI eventually making a return in the 1996–97 tour of West Indies. He scored a double century in the Second Test at Port of Spain, his first in Tests. Coming off 488 balls in 671 minutes, it was one of the slowest in Test history. He reached his century on day two, and after having scored only 94 runs on the third day, reached the double on the morning of day four. En route, he put on a 171-run stand with Rahul Dravid and a 171-run stand with Tendulkar. The match ended in a draw. Barring the 201, Sidhu had an average series and aggregated 276 at 46.00 in six innings.

Sidhu was dropped from the Test side for the series against Pakistan after a poor tour of New Zealand in 1998–99.

He announced his retirement from all forms of cricket in December 1999. He played 51 Test matches and over 100 ODIs scoring over 7,000 international runs. He scored 27 First class centuries in an 18-year career.

Known for his tendency to attack spinners, he cracked eight sixes in 124 against Sri Lanka in 1993–94, and four fifties in five innings against the Australians in 1997–98, deliberately singling out Shane Warne.

Some of the nicknames he earned were &quot;Sixer Sidhu&quot; for his prolific batting performances and &quot;Jonty Singh&quot; with respect to his improved fielding in his late career, Jonty Rhodes being the best fielder at that time.

=== Career best performances ===
==Commentator and television career==
Sidhu started his career as a commentator when India toured Sri Lanka in 2001. As a commentator, he was noted for his one-liners, which came to be known as &quot;&quot;. &quot;Sony Max&quot; that broadcast the games from the series launched a website, sidhuisms.com, where one-liners from his commentary were posted as &quot;Sidhuism of the day&quot; and contests held for users to pick his best one-liner.
After he was sacked from ESPN-Star for swearing on air, Sidhu was signed up for commentary on &quot;Ten Sports&quot;. He also regularly appeared as an expert on various Indian news channels. Sidhu started to work again for &quot;ESPN Star Sports&quot; in 2012. He was a part of the team that commentated for &quot;Sony&quot; during the 2014 season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). This led to a dispute with &quot;Star India&quot; who alleged that Sidhu had breached his 22.5 crore contract with them by working for their competitor, and sought a refund.

Sidhu also figured as a judge on the television programme &quot;The Great Indian Laughter Challenge&quot;. He also appeared in other similar programmes, such as &quot;Funjabi Chak De&quot;.

In early 2019, Sidhu caused controversy when he was interpreted as supporting Pakistan, in his response to the Pulwama Terrorist Attack that killed 40 personnel of India&#x27;s border security forces. He was asked to leave season 2 of &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot; that he had been a permanent guest on for a long time, and was replaced by Archana Puran Singh.

Cyrus Sahukar used to host a program on MTV, &quot;Piddhu the Great&quot;, where he is disguised as Piddhu, a lookalike of Sidhu. The one-liners in the program, similar to Sidhuisms, are called &quot;Pidhuisms&quot;. A similar caricaturisation was performed on season 1 of &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot; by Sunil Grover.
Sidhu made a cameo appearance in the 2004 Hindi film &quot;Mujhse Shaadi Karogi&quot; as a commentator during a cricket match. In the 2008 Punjabi language film &quot;Mera Pind&quot;, he appeared in a pivotal role alongside singer Harbhajan Mann, playing the role of a non-resident Indian who returns to his motherland despite living a successful life abroad. His most recent film appearance came in 2015 in &quot;ABCD 2&quot;; another cameo that saw him play the permanent guest in &quot;Comedy Nights with Kapil&quot;.

===Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur Corridor===
In August 2018, former Indian cricketer turned politician and current Tourism Minister of the Government of Punjab, Navjot Singh Sidhu was invited to the oath taking ceremony of the newly elected prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan. After being attacked over his decision to hug Qamar Javed Bajwa, the Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army, Sidhu claimed that Bajwa had assured him of opening the corridor before the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.

Subsequently, Government of Pakistan in September 2018, decided to open the Kartarpur corridor before the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak for visa-free entry of followers of Sikhism from India to Pakistan. After the corridor opening was confirmed by Pakistan&#x27;s Information and Broadcasting Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Navjot Singh Sidhu appreciated his cricket friend Imran Khan for taking such a great step.

In late November 2018, Sidhu came under controversy with a photo of Khalistani separatist leader Gopal Singh Chawla, a controversial Khalistani separatist leader accused of having close ties with Hafiz Saeed. Sidhu dismissed those claims and claimed &quot;Thousands of people met me every day in Pakistan and clicked photographs with me. How would I know who Chawla or Cheema is?&quot;.

==Controversies and conversations==
=== Pulwama attack ===

On 15 February 2019, during an appearance on &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot;, Sidhu condemned the recent attack on Indian soldiers in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir as &quot;cowardly and dastardly&quot;. However, he found himself in a controversy when he went on to ask: &quot;For a handful of people, can you blame the entire nation of Pakistan and can you blame an individual?&quot;

The comments drew heavy criticism. BJP leader Giriraj Singh demanded that Sidhu be expelled from the Congress Party.

On 16 February, it was reported that &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot; had responded by removing Sidhu as presenter and permanent guest, with Archana Puran Singh replacing him.

=== Balakot air strike===

Sidhu criticised Indian Air force&#x27;s anti-terrorism operation at Balakot in Pakistan. He questioned by tweet, &#x27;Were you uprooting terrorist or trees?&#x27; Sidhu questioned the purpose of Balakot air strike.

==Conviction for road rage homicide==
Sidhu (aged 25 in 1988) along with his friend Rupinder Singh Sandhu (aka Bunny Sandhu) were accused of assaulting and causing the death of a 65-year-old man named Gurnam Singh. On 27 December 1988, Sidhu and Sandhu were in their car parked near Sheranwala Gate Crossing in Patiala. Gurnam Singh in his car was on his way to a bank, and asked Sidhu to give them way. In the ensuing altercation, Gurnam was beaten by Sidhu who fled the scene. Gurnam was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead. According to a witness, Gurnam was killed by a blow to the head by Sidhu.

Sidhu was arrested by Punjab Police after the incident and was lodged in Patiala jail for several days. He was charged with murder along with Sandhu as co-accused. Sidhu pleaded not guilty and denied all charges against him. He claimed in court that he was &quot;falsely involved in this case by the complainant party&quot;. Jaswinder Singh, nephew of Gurnam Singh, claimed that he was a witness to the quarrel and was ready to testify in the Supreme Court of India. In September 1999, the trial court acquitted Sidhu.

In 2006, the Punjab and Haryana High Court reversed the verdict of the trial court and held both of them guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for the death of Gurnam Singh in Patiala. The court sent him to jail for three years in the road rage case.

Both the convicts then appealed in the Supreme Court of India. In 2007, the Supreme Court suspended Sidhu&#x27;s sentence and granted him bail. The suspended sentence allowed him to contest the Lok Sabha bypolls from Amritsar. In 2018, a bench headed by Justices Chalemeswar and Sanjay Kishan Kaul let the two off with a fine of ₹ 1,000 without any jail term, saying &quot;there was no evidence to prove that the death was caused by the single blow&quot; dealt by Sidhu. The court noted that Sidhu did not use a weapon.

The complainants filed a review plea in the Supreme court. The court noted that the hand can also be used as a &quot;weapon by itself where a boxer, wrestler, cricketer, or an extremely physically fit person inflicts a blow.&quot; The court said, &quot;The blow was not inflicted on a person identically physically placed but a 65-year-old person, more than double his age. Respondent no.1 (Sidhu) cannot say that he did not know the effect of the blow or plead ignorance on this aspect.&quot; &quot;It is not as if someone has to remind him of the extent of the injury which could be caused by a blow inflicted by him. In the given circumstances, tempers may have been lost but then the consequences of the loss of temper must be borne.&quot; Sidhu was judged guilty of the offence of simple hurt under section 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). On 19 May 2022, the Supreme Court convicted him for voluntarily causing hurt (Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code) and sentenced him to 1 year rigorous imprisonment. Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC has a maximum jail term of up to one year or a fine up to Rs 1,000 or both.

He was imprisoned in Patiala Jail along with his rival Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia against whom Sidhu contested in the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections. On 1 April 2023, he was released after spending nearly 10 months in jail.

<text>Interzone is a British fantasy and science fiction magazine. Published since 1982, &quot;Interzone&quot; is the eighth-longest-running English language science fiction magazine in history, and the longest-running British science fiction (SF) magazine. Stories published in &quot;Interzone&quot; have been finalists for the Hugo Awards and have won a Nebula Award and numerous British Science Fiction Awards.

==Publication history==
In 1981 Malcolm Edwards, who was then a freelance writer, and David Pringle, who chaired that year&#x27;s British Science Fiction Convention, independently became interested in starting a new science fiction (sf) magazine. Pringle had obtained permission from the convention committee to put that year&#x27;s profit of £1,300 (equivalent to £ in ) towards starting a magazine, and along with Simon Ounsley, Alan Dorey, and Graham James he created a proposal for a 112-page digest-sized magazine. Edwards&#x27; proposal was for a 32-page A4-sized magazine, to be funded by subscriptions; he interested John Clute, Colin Greenland, and Roz Kaveney in the idea and sent the proposal to the British Science Fiction Association (BSFA). Dorey was the chair of the BSFA at the time and put Edwards in touch with Pringle.

The two proposals differed in more than just the size and page count: Pringle had imagined a magazine that would publish non-fiction as well as a range of science fiction, whereas Edwards&#x27;s proposal was for a more literary style of fiction. Despite the differences, planning went ahead; it proved difficult to agree on who should edit the magazine, and eventually it was decided that all eight people involved should edit as an unpaid collective, with all of them reading every submission and agreeing on all editorial decisions. Pringle suggested the title, which came from the city of Interzone described in William Burroughs&#x27; novel &quot;The Naked Lunch&quot;. Charles Platt agreed to act as the American agent for the new magazine. The first issue, in A4 format, was dated Spring 1982, and subscribers to the new magazine received a booklet edition of J. G. Ballard&#x27;s story &quot;News from the Sun.&quot; Edwards and Greenland obtained a grant from the British Arts Council that helped support the magazine in its first few years, and it was also assisted by donations from Clive Sinclair and Arthur C. Clarke.

The unwieldy eight-person editorial collective did not last. Graham James was only credited as one of the editors for the first two issues, and Edwards lasted for only two more. Kaveney departed after the seventh issue, and Clute and Dorey after the ninth, though they remained as advisors. Colin Greenland left after the twelfth issue, leaving Ounsley and Pringle as co-editors. Three issues were produced in each of the first two years, after which the schedule settled down to a regular quarterly for five years before becoming bimonthly in late 1988 and obtaining newsagent distribution. Ounsley left for health reasons after the Summer 1988 issue, leaving Pringle in sole charge. Pringle&#x27;s first issue, dated September 1988, began a short bimonthly stretch, and with the May 1990 issue it became monthly.

In 1991 Pringle made arrangements with Charles Ryan, the editor of the American magazine &quot;Aboriginal Science Fiction&quot;, to exchange the contents of the two magazines for a month as a way of promoting each magazine to the subscribers of the other. The May 1991 issue of &quot;Interzone&quot; accordingly including most of the contents of the May/June 1991 issue of &quot;Aboriginal&quot;, and the following month the exchange was reversed: the July/August 1991 &quot;Aboriginal&quot; printed most of the contents of the June 1991 &quot;Interzone&quot;. The result of the experiment disappointed Pringle; there was no increase in subscriptions, though there were a handful of positive comments from readers. Pringle had launched another literary magazine, &quot;Million&quot;, and merged it with &quot;Interzone&quot; in September 1991. In 1994 &quot;Interzone&quot; absorbed &quot;Nexus&quot;, a small-press science fiction magazine edited by Paul Brazier that had seen three issues, and Brazier joined the &quot;Interzone&quot; staff as the designer and typesetter.

Pringle was able to maintain the monthly schedule for over a decade, but in 2002 it became erratic, with ten issues that year. From May 2003 the magazine was bimonthly, though Pringle was still trying to keep it to a monthly schedule, but in November the change was made permanent. Only one more bimonthly issue appeared; the next, dated Spring 2004, was three months late, and was the last one edited by Pringle. For personal and financial reasons Pringle gave up the magazine, selling it that year to Andy Cox, who had been publishing another sf magazine, &quot;The Third Alternative&quot;, since 1994. Cox returned magazine to a bimonthly schedule, starting with the September/October 2004 issue, and maintained it until the end of 2017. The January/February 2018 issue was skipped, as was the July/August 2020 issue. Cox looked into selling the magazine to PS Publishing, though he changed his mind on learning that they planned to produce only digital editions, and no print version; and also because PS told him they would not honour existing subscriptions. Cox published only one issue in 2021 and another in 2022, after which it was acquired by Gareth Jelley. Jelley published two more print issues, dated January and September 2023, and then converted it to a bimonthly electronic-only format, with no print version.

== Contents and reception ==

The first issue included an extract from &quot;The Brothel in Rosenstrasse&quot; by Michael Moorcock, and stories by Angela Carter, M. John Harrison, John Sladek, and Keith Roberts, whose &quot;Kitemaster&quot; subsequently won the BSFA short fiction award for 1982. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (SFE3) describes the early years of the magazine as &quot;hoping rather too obviously to revive something of the feeling of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s New Worlds and its New-Wave glories&quot;, but adds that by 1986 it had developed away from these beginnings. In 1984 and 1985 Pringle published editorials that challenged writers to submit science fiction that was &quot;a more realistic forecast and melding of the social and human impact of technological developments&quot;, in SFE3&#x27;s words. These editorials, along with the availability of &quot;Interzone&quot; as a fiction market, led to the emergence of a new generation of young British sf writers, including Stephen Baxter, Eric Brown, Nicola Griffith, Peter F. Hamilton, Paul McAuley, Ian McDonald, Alastair Reynolds, Charles Stross, and Liz Williams. Established British writers such as Gwyneth Jones, Brian M. Stableford and Garry Kilworth also became contributors, and &quot;Interzone&quot; attracted overseas submissions as well, from Greg Bear, Thomas M. Disch, Karen Joy Fowler, Geoffrey A. Landis, Pat Murphy and Michael Swanwick, among others. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; (SFE) argues that &quot;Interzone&quot; was thus responsible for invigorating science fiction writing in the UK, after &quot;long years of near-stagnation in the 1970s and early 1980s&quot;, and generating a sense of community among UK sf writers. The science fiction historian Mike Ashley regards &quot;Interzone&quot; as one of the success stories of the 1980s in science fiction. Having a collective editorial team gave the magazine additional resources in the early days, and its steady growth gave it stability over its first decade, until it was well-established.

Since Pringle was the publisher as well as the editor, he was able to print experimental fiction; this was not true of US magazines such as &quot;Analog&quot;, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science FIction&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. Pringle took advantage of this freedom, and the results were sometimes controversial. &quot;Horse Meat&quot;, by Brian Aldiss, in the November 1992 issue, involved a rape scene between a stallion and a woman, and led Aldiss to reply to the letters of protest, arguing that it commented on brutal regimes around the world. &quot;The Salt Box&quot;, by Gwyneth Jones, in the July 2001 issue, included a reference to underage sex and led to Pringle receiving a visit from the police, though they took no action.

Grega Egan was one of the most popular writers in &quot;Interzone&quot; during the 1990s, with many well-received stories. The SFE describes his &quot;Learning to Be Me&quot;, in the July 1990 &quot;Interzone&quot;, as one of the best stories of its time, and his fiction frequently did well in &quot;Interzone&quot;&#x27;s annual reader popularity polls. The 1990s also saw the debut of Chris Beckett, who published nearly twenty stories in &quot;Interzone&quot; over a decade before selling elsewhere. Beckett&#x27;s short story &quot;The Circle of Stones&quot; in the February 1992 issue was expanded into &quot;Dark Eden&quot;, which won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1992. Nick Harkaway&#x27;s first two sales were to &quot;Interzone&quot;, under his real name of Nick Cornwell.

&quot;Interzone&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s carried more non-fiction that the leading US science fiction magazines; only two-thirds of the magazine was fiction. Long-running non-fiction departments included &quot;Mutant Popcorn&quot;, a film review column by Nick Lowe, and &quot;Ansible Link&quot;, a science fiction news column by David Langford. The SFE describes &quot;Interzone&quot;&#x27;s cover and interior art as &quot;uneven&quot; in the early years of the magazine, but singles out Simon M. Short (known as SMS) as a notable early contributor of covers, starting in 1991. When Paul Brazier became the graphic designer in 1994 he helped update the magazine&#x27;s design, and according to SFE &quot;Interzone&quot;&#x27;s appearance improved steadily over the next few years. Under Cox&#x27;s editorship the nonfiction departments such as reviews were expanded, and new writers continued to appear, along with well-established names like Christopher Priest.

Gardner Dozois referred to &quot;Interzone&quot; in 2007 as the &quot;handsomest SF magazine in the business&quot;. In 2006, the Science Fiction Writers of America removed the magazine from its list of professional markets due to low rates and small circulation. However, within the genre field the magazine is still ranked as a professional publication. As Dozois has stated, &quot;By the definition of SFWA, &quot;Interzone&quot; doesn&#x27;t really qualify as a &#x27;professional magazine&#x27; because of its low rates and circulation, but as it&#x27;s thoroughly professional in the caliber of writers that it attracts and in the quality of the fiction it produces, just about everyone considers it to be a professional magazine anyway.&quot; It pays semi-professional rates to writers.
=== Awards and recognition ===
&quot;Interzone&quot; won the Hugo Award for best semiprozine in 1995. In 2005 the Worldcon committee gave David Pringle a Special Committee Award for his work on the magazine which encouraged &quot;fresh ideas and new voices&quot;. The magazine has also won the British Fantasy Award, in 2012 and 2022.

Each year, multiple stories published in &quot;Interzone&quot; are reprinted in the annual &quot;year&#x27;s best stories&quot; anthologies, while other stories have been finalists for the Hugo and Nebula Awards. In 2010 the magazine became one of only eleven magazines to have a story win a Nebula Award. The winning story was the novelette &quot;Sinner, Baker, Fabulist, Priest; Red Mask, Black Mask, Gentleman, Beast&quot; by Eugie Foster. In addition, 16 stories originally published in &quot;Interzone&quot; have won the British Science Fiction Award for short fiction.

In 2009 &quot;Interzone&quot; became the longest-running British SF magazine, passing &quot;New Worlds&quot;&#x27;s total with its 223rd issue.

=== Writers ===
&quot;Interzone&quot; features regular columns by David Langford (&quot;Ansible Link&quot;– News &amp; Gossip, Obituaries), Tony Lee (&quot;Laser Fodder&quot; – DVD Reviews) and Nick Lowe (&quot;Mutant Popcorn&quot; – Film Reviews). In 2010, Lowe won a British Science Fiction Award for his &quot;Mutant Popcorn&quot; column.

In 2008 a Mundane SF issue was published, guest edited by Geoff Ryman, Julian Todd and Trent Walters.

Leeds-based artist Pete Lyon contributed many illustrations in the 1980s. He was nominated for the British SF Association Awards in 1987 for his cover work on the first Interzone magazine.

<doc id="583238" wikidata="Q1377526" url="?curid=583238" title="Axial skeleton">
<text>The axial skeleton is the core part of the endoskeleton made of the bones of the head and trunk of vertebrates. In the human skeleton, it consists of 80 bones and is composed of the skull (28 bones, including the cranium, mandible and the middle ear ossicles), the vertebral column (26 bones, including vertebrae, sacrum and coccyx), the rib cage (25 bones, including ribs and sternum), and the hyoid bone. The axial skeleton is joined to the appendicular skeleton (which support the limbs) via the shoulder girdles and the pelvis.

==Structure==
Flat bones house the brain and other vital organs. This article mainly deals with the axial skeletons of humans; however, it is important to understand its evolutionary lineage. The human axial skeleton consists of 81 different bones forming the medial core of the body and connects the pelvis to the body, where the appendicular skeleton attaches. As the skeleton grows older the bones get weaker with the exception of the skull. The skull remains strong to protect the brain from injury.

In humans, the axial skeleton serves to protect the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs.

===Human skull===

The human skull consists of the cranium and the facial bones. The cranium holds and protects the brain in a large space called the cranial vault. The cranium is formed from eight plate-shaped bones which fit together at meeting points (joints) called sutures. In addition there are 14 facial bones which form the lower front part of the skull. Together the 22 bones that compose the skull form additional, smaller spaces besides the cranial vault, such as the cavities for the eyes, the internal ear, the nose, and the mouth. The most important facial bones include the jaw or mandible, the upper jaw or maxilla, the zygomatic or cheek bone, and the nasal bone.

Humans are born with separate plates which later fuse to allow flexibility as the skull passes through the pelvis and birth canal during birth. During development the eight separate plates of the immature bones fuse into one single structure known as the skull. The only bone that remains separate from the rest of the skull is the mandible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inner Body/Skull&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rib cage===

The rib cages are composed of 12 pairs of ribs plus the sternum for a total of 25 separate bones. The rib cage functions as protection for the vital organs such as the heart and lungs. The ribs are shaped like crescents, with one end flattened and the other end rounded. The rounded ends are attached at joints to the thoracic vertebrae at the back and the flattened ends come together at the sternum, in the front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Postcranial Skeletal/Ribs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper seven pairs of ribs attach to the sternum with costal cartilage and are known as &quot;true ribs&quot;. The 8th through 10th ribs have non-costal cartilage which connects them to the ribs above, and for this they are known as &quot;false ribs&quot;. The last two ribs are called &quot;floating ribs&quot; because they do not attach to the sternum or to other ribs and simply &quot;hang free&quot;. The length of each rib increases from number one to seven and then decreases until rib pair number 12. The first rib is the shortest, broadest, flattest, and most curved.

===Vertebral column===

At birth the majority of humans have 33 separate vertebrae. However, during normal development several vertebrae fuse, leaving a total of 24, in most cases. The confusion about whether or not there are 32–34 vertebrae stems from the fact that the two lowest vertebrae, the sacrum and the coccyx, are single bones made up of several smaller bones which have fused together. This is how the vertebrae are counted: 24 separate vertebrae and the sacrum, formed from 5 fused vertebrae, and the coccyx, formed from 3–5 fused vertebrae. If you count the coccyx and sacrum each as one vertebra, then there are 26 vertebrae. If the fused vertebrae are all counted separately, then the total number of vertebrae comes to between 32 and 34 (due to the number making up the coccyx varying between 3 and 5).

The vertebral column consists of 5 parts. The most cranial (uppermost) part is made up by the cervical vertebrae (7), followed by thoracic vertebrae (12), lumbar (5), sacral (5) and coccygeal vertebrae (3–5).

Cervical vertebrae make up the junction between the vertebral column and the cranium. Sacral and coccygeal vertebrae are fused and thus often called &quot;sacral bone&quot; or &quot;coccygeal bone&quot; as unit. The sacral bone makes up the junction between the vertebral column and the pelvic bones.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;axial&quot; is taken from the word &quot;axis&quot; and refers to the fact that the bones are located close to or along the central &quot;axis&quot; of the body. The term axis means the central point around which the other structures are distributed.

==Short summary==
The axial skeleton consists of 80 bones:
* The skull, which contains 22 bones, from which 8 are cranial and 14 are facial,
* 6 middle ear ossicles (3 in each ear),
* 1 hyoid bone in the neck,
* 26 bones of vertebral column,
* 1 chest bone (sternum), and
* 24 ribs (12 pairs).

<doc id="583246" wikidata="Q261990" url="?curid=583246" title="Lydia Lunch">
<text>Lydia Lunch (born Lydia Anne Koch; June 2, 1959) is an American singer, poet, writer, actress and self-empowerment speaker. Her career began during the 1970s New York City no wave scene as the singer and guitarist of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks.

Her work typically features provocative and confrontational noise music delivery, and has maintained an anti-commercial ethic, operating independently of major labels and distributors. The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; named Lunch one of the ten most influential performers of the 1990s. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;Death Valley &#x27;69&quot; featuring Lunch; one of &quot;The 50 Most Evil Songs Ever&quot;.

==Biography==
Lunch was born on June 2, 1959, in Rochester, New York, and is of German and Italian descent. She moved to New York City at the age of 16 and eventually moved into a communal household of artists and musicians. After befriending Alan Vega and Martin Rev at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, she founded the short-lived but influential no-wave band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, with James Chance. Both Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and the Contortions, Chance&#x27;s subsequent band, played on the no wave compilation &quot;No New York&quot;, produced by Brian Eno. Lunch later appeared on two songs on &quot;James White and the Blacks&quot; album, &quot;Off-White&quot;. She was in two other short lived bands before launching her solo career in 1980, Beirut Slump and 8 Eyed Spy. In the mid-1980s, she formed the recording and publishing company &quot;Widowspeak Productions&quot; (also known as just &quot;Widowspeak&quot;), on which she continues to release her own material, from music to spoken word. Two albums published by Lunch&#x27;s label were released in 2013: &quot;Collision Course &amp; Trust The Witch&quot;, by Big Sexy Noise (released on Cherry Red), and &quot;Retrovirus&quot; (released on Interbang Records); both albums are by Lunch&#x27;s musical projects.

She released her studio album &quot;Smoke in the Shadows&quot; in November 2004, through Atavistic Records and Breakin Beats, after a six-year break from music. Nels Cline, the lead guitarist of alternative rock band Wilco, was featured on the album. &quot;Smoke in the Shadows&quot; was met with positive reviews by Allmusic, PopMatters, and Tiny Mix Tapes.

In 2009 Lunch formed the band Big Sexy Noise. The group features Lunch on vocals, James Johnston (guitars), Terry Edwards (organ, saxophone), and Ian White (drums). Johnston, White and Edwards are members of the British band Gallon Drunk. A six-track eponymous EP was released on June 1, 2009, through Sartorial Records, and included a cover of Lou Reed&#x27;s song &quot;Kill Your Sons,&quot; as well as &quot;The Gospel Singer&quot;, a song co-written with Gordon. The debut, self-titled album, &quot;Big Sexy Noise&quot;, was released in 2010, followed by &quot;Trust The Witch&quot; in 2011. For both albums, Lunch and her band completed tours throughout Europe.

In 2010, The Jeffrey Lee Pierce Sessions Project launched &quot;We Are Only Riders&quot;, the first of a series of four albums featuring Pierce&#x27;s previously-unreleased works-in-progress. The album features interpretations of Pierce&#x27;s work by friends, collaborators, and admirers, including Lunch. Lunch also contributed to the second album from the project, &quot;The Journey is Long&quot;, which was released in April 2012.
Although the Pierce Sessions Project&#x27;s third and final album, &quot;The Task Has Overwhelmed Us&quot;, was due for release in late 2012, the schedule was changed after the release of the second installment. Glitterhouse Records, the label producing the collection, instead released a third album titled &quot;Axles &amp; Sockets&quot; in May 2014, on which Lunch performs &quot;The Journey Is Long&quot; with Pierce&#x27;s recordings. The label explained that the third album has become the &quot;penultimate&quot; full-length release of the Project, but did not name the final album, or its release date.

Lunch released the album &quot;Retrovirus&quot; (also the name of the band Lunch has played with since then) in 2013 on Interbang Records and ugEXPLODE (the vast majority of the album tracks are published by Widowspeak). Together with band members Weasel Walter, Algis Kizys, and Bob Bert, Lunch performed a show following the album&#x27;s release at the Bowery Electric venue in New York City, in May 2013. In March 2022 the Center for Popular Music (CPM) at Middle Tennessee State University named her the recipient of the CPM Fellows Award. The only previous recipients of this honor were Barry Gibb and Lamont Dozier.

===Film===
She appeared in two films by directors Scott B and Beth B. In &quot;Black Box&quot; she played a dominatrix, and in &quot;Vortex&quot; she played a private detective named Angel Powers. During this time, she also appeared in a number of films by Vivienne Dick, including &quot;She Had Her Gun All Ready&quot; (1978) and &quot;Beauty Becomes The Beast&quot; (1979), co-starring with Pat Place. In 2011, Lunch appeared in &quot;Mutantes: punk, porn, feminism&quot;, a film directed by Virginie Despentes, also featuring Annie Sprinkle and Catherine Breillat.
She also wrote, directed, and acted in underground films, sometimes collaborating with underground filmmaker Nick Zedd and photographer Richard Kern.

===Spoken word===
Lunch has recorded and performed as a spoken word artist, collaborating with artists such as Exene Cervenka, Henry Rollins, Don Bajema and Hubert Selby Jr. as well as hosting spoken-word performance night &quot;The Unhappy Hour&quot; at the Parlour Club.

===Literature===
In 1997, Lunch released &quot;Paradoxia&quot;, a loose autobiography, in which she documented her early life, sexual history, substance abuse and mental health problems. &quot;Time Out New York&quot; gave it a favorable review, while Bookslut ambiguously concluded &quot;It&#x27;s to the reader to determine whether Lunch&#x27;s study goes deeper than that, or if instead, it&#x27;s a kind of literary and philosophical repetition compulsion, a reprisal of greatest hits from male nihilists, sexual adventurers and chroniclers of deviance.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; called it a &quot;brutal but boring and predictable circus, about which Lunch shows no emotions. Only fatigue seems to have given her pause.&quot;

Additionally, Lunch has authored both traditional books and comix (with graphic novel artist Ted McKeever).

===Other work===
In 2013, Lunch ran self-empowerment workshops in locations such as Ojai, California, US and Rennes, France. In regard to the Rennes workshop, her inaugural self-empowerment event, Lunch recalled: &quot;Every day people would come in that would have to get a hug. I felt like mother India.&quot; In April of that year, Lunch said that she is the producer of the Emilio Cubeiro album &quot;Death of an Asshole&quot;. In 2014 Lunch shot a series of photographs with Austin, Texas-based artist, Darla Teagarden.

In 2019 Lunch started the podcast &quot;The Lydian Spin&quot;. Lunch hosts each weekly episode with bassist Tim Dahl.

<doc id="583253" wikidata="Q1225660" url="?curid=583253" title="Dilution gene">
<text>A dilution gene is any one of a number of genes that act to create a lighter coat color in living creatures. There are many examples of such genes:

==General==
Diluted coat colors have melanocytes, but vary from darker colors due to the concentration or type of these pigment-producing cells, not their absence. Pigment dilution, sometimes referred to as hypomelanism, has been called leucism, albinism (perfect, impartial, or dilute), ghosting, paling, and isabellinism.
*Albinism describes a condition where pigment cells synthesize little or no pigment
*Leucism describes a condition that creates loss of pigment cells

==Cats==
Cat coat genetics discusses many dilution genes in cats.

==Dogs==
In dogs, a mutation of the &quot;MLPH&quot; locus known as the dilute gene causes eumelanin to lighten while pheomelanin remains almost unchanged. Dogs of some breeds with the dilute gene often suffer from colour dilution alopecia (CDA).

=== Appearance ===
Of the colour shades found in the coat of dogs, the light brown caused by pheomelanin is hardly affected. Black eumelanin is lightened to a grey called &quot;blue&quot;. Chocolate brown eumelanine is lightened to the typical colour of the Weimaraner.

=== Genetics ===
The dilute gene d is recessive to the wild type allele D. A gene test can be used to determine a dog&#x27;s genotype concerning genes for pigmentation. In some dog breeds lightened by the dilute gene, the mutation d is associated with color dilution alopecia (CDA). Since not all breeds in which the gene occurs exhibit these problems, it is suspected that there may be a second previously unknown mutation of the MLPH gene.

Every dog has two alleles - one from the sire and one from the dam. The gene expression depends on the genotype: 

# DD: Both sire and dam have inherited the wild type allele. The coat is not lightened.
# Dd: Either sire or dam have inherited the allele for dilution. However, the dilution of colour is not visible in the phenotype - the dog has the same coat colour as a DD dog.
# dd: Sire and dam have inherited the allele for the dilute colour expression. The black areas of the coat are lightened to blue, dogs additionally lightened by the gene on the B locus take on the colour typical of the Weimaraner.

According to the Mendelian Rules, an average of 25% of the puppies receive the homozygous gene combination dd if both parents are genetic carriers.

==Horses==

*Equine coat color genetics discusses color genes in horses, including a brief description of dilution genes
*Equine coat color describes various colors in horses
*Cream gene, describes the process for horses by which the cremello, perlino, smoky cream double-dilute colors are created as well as the buckskin, palomino and smoky black single dilute colors.
*Dun gene describes another common dilution gene in horses
*Champagne gene, describes a different dilution gene in horses that also creates cream coloring, pale skin with mottling and light-colored eyes.
*Pearl gene, also called the &quot;Barlink factor&quot;, is a recessive gene. One copy of the allele has no effect on the coat color of black, bay or chestnut horses. Two copies on a chestnut horse produce a pale, uniform apricot color of body hair, mane and tail as well as pale skin. It also interacts with Cream dilution to produce &quot;pseudo-double&quot; Cream dilutes with pale skin and blue or green eyes.
*Silver Dapple Gene lightens black hair, such as the mane and tail of a bay horse
*Mushroom (horse) describes an unknown and unmapped theorized dilution gene dilutes red pigment in body color to a pale beige color.

<doc id="583254" wikidata="Q1404066" url="?curid=583254" title="Cat coat genetics">
<text>Cat coat genetics determine the coloration, pattern, length, and texture of feline fur. The variations among cat coats are physical properties and should not be confused with cat breeds. A cat may display the coat of a certain breed without actually being that breed. For example, a Neva Masquerade (Siberian colorpoint) could wear point coloration, the stereotypical coat of a Siamese.

== Solid colors ==
=== Eumelanin and phaeomelanin ===
==== Eumelanin ====
The browning gene &quot;B/b/bl&quot; codes for TYRP1 (), an enzyme involved in the metabolic pathway for eumelanin pigment production. Its dominant form, &quot;B&quot;, will produce black eumelanin. It has two recessive variants, &quot;b&quot; (chocolate) and &quot;bl&quot; (cinnamon), with &quot;bl&quot; being recessive to both &quot;B&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. Chocolate is a rich dark brown color, and is referred to as chestnut in some breeds. Cinnamon is a light brown which may be a reddish color.

==== Sex-linked red ====

The sex-linked red &quot;Orange&quot; locus, &quot;O/o&quot;, determines whether a cat will produce eumelanin. In cats with orange fur, phaeomelanin (red pigment) completely replaces eumelanin (black or brown pigment). This gene is located on the X chromosome. The orange allele is O, and non-orange is o. Males can typically only be orange or non-orange due to only having one X chromosome. Since females have two X chromosomes, they have two alleles of this gene. OO results in orange fur, oo results in fur without any orange (black, brown, etc.), and Oo results in a tortoiseshell cat, in which some parts of the fur are orange and other areas non-orange. One in three thousand tortoiseshell cats are male, making the combination possible but rare- however, due to the nature of their genetics, male tortoiseshells often exhibit chromosomal abnormalities. In one study, less than a third of male calicos had a simple XXY Klinefelter&#x27;s karyotype, slightly more than a third were complicated XXY mosaics, and about a third had no XXY component at all.

The pelt color commonly referred to as &quot;orange&quot; is scientifically known as red. Other common names include yellow, ginger, and marmalade. Red show cats have a deep orange color, but it can also present as a yellow or light ginger color. Unidentified &quot;rufousing polygenes&quot; are theorized to be the reason for this variance.
&quot;Orange&quot; is epistatic to &quot;nonagouti&quot;, so all red cats are tabbies. &quot;Solid&quot; red show cats are usually low contrast ticked tabbies.

The identity of the gene at the &quot;Orange&quot; locus was narrowed down to a 3.5 Mb stretch on the X chromosome in 2009. In 2024 it was discovered that the dominant orange color associated with the &quot;Orange&quot; locus is the result of a genomic deletion in a regulatory region of Arhgap36, a Rho GTPase activating protein. The deletion results in a 13-fold increase in expression of the protein in melanocytes. 

=== Dilution ===

The &quot;Dense pigment&quot; gene, &quot;D/d&quot;, codes for melanophilin (&quot;MLPH&quot;; ), a protein involved in the transportation and deposition of pigment into a growing hair. When a cat has two of the recessive &quot;d&quot; alleles (Maltese dilution), black fur becomes &quot;blue&quot; (appearing gray), chocolate fur becomes &quot;lilac&quot; (appearing light, almost grayish brown-lavender), cinnamon fur becomes &quot;fawn&quot;, and red fur becomes &quot;cream&quot;. Similar to red cats, all cream cats are tabbies. The &quot;d&quot; allele is a single-base deletion that truncates the protein. If the cat has d/d genes, the coat is diluted. If the genes are D/D or D/d, the coat will be unaffected.


=== Other genes ===

* &quot;Barrington Brown&quot; is a recessive browning gene that dilutes black to mahogany, brown to light brown and chocolate to pale coffee. It is different from the browning gene and has only been observed in laboratory cats.
* The &quot;Dilution modifier&quot; gene, &quot;Dm&quot;, &quot;caramelizes&quot; the dilute colors as a dominant trait. The existence of this phenomenon as a discrete gene is a controversial subject among feline enthusiasts.
* &quot;Amber&quot;, a mutation at the extension locus &quot;E/e&quot; (the melanocortin 1 receptor, &quot;MC1R&quot;) changes black pigment to amber or light amber, similar in appearance to red and cream. Kittens are born dark but lighten up as they age. Paws and nose still exhibit the original undiluted color in contrast to other diluted colors, where paws and nose have the diluted color. This phenomenon was first identified in Norwegian Forest cats.
* Another recessive mutation at extension was discovered which causes the russet color in Burmese cats. It is symbolized as er. Like amber cats, russet cats lighten as they age.
* A modifying factor has also been hypothesized in shaded silver and chinchilla Persians whose fur turns pale golden in adulthood, due to low levels of phaeomelanin production. These cats resemble shaded or tipped goldens, but are genetically shaded or tipped silvers. This is probably related to the phenomenon known as &quot;tarnishing&quot; in silvers.

==Tabbies==

Tabby cats have a range of variegated and blotched coats, consisting of a dark pattern on a lighter background. This variety is derived from the interplay of multiple genes and resulting phenotypes. Most tabbies feature thin dark markings on the face, including the &#x27;M&#x27; on the forehead and an eyeliner effect, pigmented lips and paws, and a pink nose outlined in darker pigment. However, the following different coat patterns are all possible:
* Mackerel: Thin, dark stripes (sometimes called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;)
* Blotched/Classic: Thicker bands or whorls of dark pigment.
* Spotted: Broken bands that look more like individual spots.
* Ticked: No distinct stripes, spots, or blotches on the body—though some may be visible on the legs, face, and tail.

=== Agouti ===

The agouti factor determines the &quot;background&quot; of the tabby coat, which consists of hairs that are banded with dark eumelanin and lighter phaeomelanin along the length of the hair shaft. The &quot;Agouti&quot; gene, with its dominant &quot;A&quot; allele and recessive &quot;a&quot; allele, controls the coding for agouti signaling protein (ASIP; ). The wild-type dominant &quot;A&quot; causes the banding and thus an overall lightening effect on the hair, while the recessive &quot;non-agouti&quot; or &quot;hypermelanistic&quot; allele &quot;a&quot; does not initiate this shift in the pigmentation pathway. As a result, homozygous &quot;aa&quot; have pigment production throughout the entire growth cycle of the hair and therefore along its full length. These homozygotes are solidly dark throughout, which obscures the appearance of the characteristic dark tabby markings—sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern, called &quot;ghost striping&quot;, can be seen, especially in bright slanted light on kittens and on the legs, tail and sometimes elsewhere on adults.

A major exception to the solid masking of the tabby pattern exists, as the &quot;O&quot; allele of the &quot;O/o&quot; locus is epistatic over the &quot;aa&quot; genotype. That is, in red or cream colored cats, tabby marking is displayed regardless of the genotype at the agouti locus. However, some red and most cream tabbies do have a fainter pattern when lacking an agouti allele, indicating that the &quot;aa&quot; genotype does still have a faint effect even if it does not induce complete masking. The mechanism of this process is unknown.

=== Dark markings ===
The &quot;Tabby&quot; locus on chromosome A1 accounts for most tabby patterns seen in domestic cats, including those patterns seen in most breeds. The dominant allele &quot;TaM&quot; produces mackerel tabbies, and the recessive &quot;Tab&quot; produce classic (sometimes referred to as blotched) tabbies. The gene responsible for this differential patterning has been identified as &quot;transmembrane aminopeptidase Q&quot; (&quot;Taqpep&quot;, ). A threonine to asparagine substitution at residue 139 (T139N) in this protein is responsible for producing the tabby phenotype in domestic cats. In cheetahs, a base pair insertion into exon 20 of the protein replaces the 16 C-terminal residues with 109 new ones (N977Kfs110), generating the king cheetah coat variant.

The wild-type (in African wildcats) is the mackerel tabby (stripes look like thin fishbones and may break up into bars or spots). The most common variant is the &quot;classic&quot; tabby pattern (broad bands, whorls, and spirals of dark color on pale background usually with bulls-eye or oyster pattern on flank). Spotted tabbies have their stripes broken up into spots, which may be arranged vertically or horizontally. A 2010 study suggests that spotted coats are caused by the modification of mackerel stripes, and may cause varying phenotypes such as &quot;broken mackerel&quot; tabbies via multiple loci. If the genes are Sp/Sp or Sp/sp the tabby coat will be spotted or broken. If it is an sp/sp gene, the tabby pattern will remain either mackerel or blotched. This gene has no effect on cats with a ticked coat.

=== Ticked tabby ===
The &quot;Ticked&quot; (&quot;Ti&quot;) locus on chromosome B1 controls the generation of &quot;ticked coats&quot;, agouti coats with virtually no stripes or bars. Ticked tabbies are rare in the random-bred population, but fixed in certain breeds such as the Abyssinian and Singapura. &quot;TiA&quot; is the dominant allele that produces ticked coats; &quot;Ti+&quot; is the recessive one. The causative gene for ticked tabby markings is &quot;Dickkopf-related protein 4&quot; (&quot;DKK4&quot;). Both a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at residue 63 (C63Y) and an alanine to valine substitution at residue 18 (A18V) result in decreased &quot;DKK4&quot;, which is associated with . Both variants are present in the Abyssinian breed, and the A18V variant is found in the Burmese breed. Stripes often remain to some extent on the face, tail, legs, and sometimes the chest (&quot;bleeding through&quot;). Traditionally, this has been thought to happen in heterozygotes (&quot;TiATi+&quot;) but be nearly or completely nonexistent in homozygotes (&quot;TiATiA&quot;). The ticked tabby allele is epistatic to and therefore completely (or mostly) masks all the other tabby alleles, &quot;hiding&quot; the patterns they would otherwise express.

It was once thought that &quot;TiA&quot; was an allele of the &quot;Tabby&quot; gene, called &quot;Ta&quot;, dominant to all other alleles at the locus.

=== Other genes ===
* Other genes (&quot;pattern modifier&quot; genes) are theorized to be responsible for creating various type of spotting patterns, many of which are variations on a basic mackerel or classic pattern. There are also hypothetical factors which affect the timing and frequency of the agouti shift, affecting agouti band width and the number and quality of alternating bands of eumelanin and phaeomelanin on individual hairs.
* There is a gene not yet identified, but believed to be related to the agouti gene in the Chausie breed that produces silver-tipped black fur similar to Abyssinian ticked fur, known as &quot;grizzled&quot;. This phenomenon is purported to have been inherited from the hybridization of the domestic cat to the jungle cat (&quot;Felis chaus&quot;).
* The rosette tabby pattern is a pattern similar to that of a leopard, where rosette spots are spread over the body. The pattern is found in hybrid cat breeds, such as the Bengal and Safari.
* The &quot;inhibited pigment&quot; gene, &quot;I/i&quot;. The dominant allele (I) produces &quot;tipped&quot; hairs that are fully colored only at the tip and have a white base. This allele appears to interact with other genes to produce various degrees of tipping, ranging from deeply tipped silver tabby to lightly tipped shaded silver and chinchilla silver. The inhibitor gene interacts with the non-agouti genotype (I-aa) to produce the color known as smoke. The homozygous recessive genotype when combined with the agouti gene (iiA-), produces tabby coloration, which can vary along a spectrum ranging from a deeply patterned brown tabby, to a lighter &quot;golden tabby&quot;, to the very lightly colored shaded or chinchilla golden colors. Red and cream cats with the inhibitor gene (I-O-) are commonly called &quot;cameo&quot;.

== Tortoiseshells and calicos ==


Tortoiseshells have patches of orange fur (pheomelanin based) and black or brown (eumelanin based) fur, caused by X-inactivation. Because this requires two X chromosomes, the vast majority of tortoiseshells are female, with approximately 1 in 3,000 being male. Male tortoiseshells can occur as a result of chromosomal abnormalities such as Klinefelter syndrome, by mosaicism, or by a phenomenon known as chimerism, where two early stage embryos are merged into a single kitten.

Tortoiseshells with a relatively small amount of white spotting are known as &quot;tortoiseshell and white&quot;, while those with a larger amount are known in the United States as calicos. Calicos are also known as tricolor cats, &quot;mi-ke&quot; (meaning &quot;triple fur&quot;) in Japanese, and &quot;lapjeskat&quot; (meaning &quot;patches cat&quot;) in Dutch. The factor that distinguishes tortoiseshell from calico is the pattern of eumelanin and pheomelanin, which is partly dependent on the amount of white, due to an effect of the white spotting gene on the general distribution of melanin. A cat which has both an orange and non-orange gene, Oo, and little to no white spotting, will present with a mottled blend of black/red and blue/cream, reminiscent of tortoiseshell material, and is called a tortoiseshell cat. An Oo cat with a large amount of white will have bigger, clearly defined patches of black/red and blue/cream, and is called a calico in the US. 
With intermediate amounts of white, a cat may exhibit a calico pattern, a tortie pattern, or something in between, depending on other epigenetic factors. Blue tortoiseshell, or &quot;diluted calico&quot;, cats have a lighter coloration (blue/cream) and are sometimes called &quot;calimanco&quot; or &quot;clouded tiger&quot;.

A true tricolor must consist of three colors: white, a red-based color like ginger or cream, and black-based color like black or blue. Tricolor should not be mistaken for the natural gradations in a tabby pattern. The shades which are present in the pale bands of a tabby are not considered to constitute a separate color.

=== Variations ===
* The basic tortoiseshell pattern has several different colors depending on the color of the eumelanin (the B locus), and dilution (the D locus).
* Tortoiseshell tabbies, also known as &quot;torbies&quot;, display tabby patterning on both red- and black-based colors. Calico tabbies are also called &quot;calibys&quot; or &quot;tabicos&quot;.

Tortoiseshell cats with small white patches are called &quot;tortico&quot; cats, a portmanteau of &quot;calico&quot; and &quot;tortoiseshell&quot;.

== White spotting and epistatic white ==
The KIT gene determines whether or not there will be any white in the coat, except when a solid white coat is caused by albinism. White spotting and epistatic white (also known as dominant white) were long thought to be two separate genes (called &quot;S&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively), but in fact they are both on the KIT gene. The two have been combined into a single &quot;white spotting&quot; locus (&quot;W&quot;). White spotting can take many forms, from a small spot of white to the mostly-white pattern of the Turkish Van, while epistatic white produces a fully white cat (solid or self white). The KIT gene &quot;W&quot; locus has the following alleles:
* WD (or W)=dominant white (solid/self white), autosomal dominant allele. It causes complete white coloration by disrupting replication and migration of melanocytes into the skin. The carriers of this allele are white regardless of any other color-associated gene. It is linked to blue eyes and congenital sensorineural deafness. The deafness is due to a reduction in the population and survival of melanoblast stem cells, which in addition to creating pigment-producing cells, develop into a variety of neurological cell types. White cats with one or two blue eyes have a particularly high likelihood of being deaf. Dominant white is distinct from albinism (&quot;c&quot;) which results from a mutation in a different gene that has no known impact on hearing.
* wS (or S)=white spotting (bicolor or tricolor cats), dominant allele. It only disrupts migration of melanocytes to certain patches in the skin, thus leading to the formation of white spots. It exhibits codominance and variable expression:
** heterozygote (Wh or &quot;Ss&quot;)= high degree of spotting white (between 0–50% white); bicolor/tricolor or ventral white (usually the feet, nose, chest, and belly), which is dominant to solid color. Heterozygous cats have somewhere between 0-50% white.
** homozygote (Wl or &quot;SS&quot;)=low degree of spotting white (between 50 and 100% white); dominant harlequin and van pattern. The van pattern is named after the Lake Van region in Turkey, and expresses as coloration limited to the head and tail.
* w (or N)=wild-type or normal (non-white coats), recessive allele. Homozygotes for it won&#x27;t have any white in their coat.
* wg=Birman white gloving allele, recessive allele.
* wsal=salmiak allele, recessive allele. In addition to a white tuxedo pattern, hairs are colored at the root fading into white at the tips, except on the head, where they are often colored all the way through. It was found in Finland and the name means &quot;salty licorice&quot;.

== Colorpoint and albinism ==
The colorpoint pattern is most commonly associated with Siamese cats, but due to crossbreeding may also appear in any (non-pedigree) domesticated cat. A colorpoint cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter version of the same color on the rest of the body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color. A few examples are seal points (dark brown to black), chocolate points (warm, lighter brown), blue points (gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points. This pattern is the result of a temperature sensitive mutation in one of the enzymes in the metabolic pathway from tyrosine to pigment, such as melanin; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpoint cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change. More specifically, the &quot;albino&quot; locus contains the gene &quot;TYR&quot; (). Two distinct alleles causing blue-eyed and pink-eyed albinism respectively have been previously theorized.

Although the Siamese colorpoint pattern is the most famous coloration produced by &quot;TYR&quot;, there are color mutations at the locus.

* &quot;C&quot; is the wildtype allele resulting in full pigmentation and is completely dominant to all other known alleles at the locus.
* Point=&quot;cs&quot; is the &quot;point&quot; allele associated with the Siamese colorpoint pattern.
* Sepia=&quot;cb&quot; is an allele called &quot;sepia&quot; (or solid), and is most associated with Burmese cats. It produces a pattern similar to the Siamese colorpoint, but with a much lower contrast and amber-yellow to green eyes.
* Mink=&quot;cs&quot; and &quot;cb&quot; are codominant, with &quot;cb&quot;/&quot;cs&quot; cats having an intermediate phenotype termed &quot;mink&quot;, in which the pigment distribution is between sepia and point, and the eye color is blue-green (aquamarine).
* Albinism=&quot;c&quot; and c2 are two synonymous alleles recessive to all other alleles at the locus that cause albinism.
* &quot;cm&quot; is a novel mutation in Burmese cats that results in a color pattern named mocha. Its interactions with other alleles have not yet been fully established.

The tyrosine pathway also produces neurotransmitters, thus mutations in the early parts of that pathway may affect not only pigment, but also neurological development. This results in a higher frequency of cross-eyes among colorpoint cats, as well as the high frequency of cross-eyes in white tigers.

== Silver and golden series ==
=== Silver series ===
The silver series is caused by the &quot;Melanin inhibitor&quot; gene &quot;I/i&quot;. The dominant form causes melanin production to be suppressed, but it affects phaeomelanin (red pigment) much more than eumelanin (black or brown pigment). On tabbies, this turns the background a sparkling silver color while leaving the stripe color intact, making a cold-toned &quot;silver tabby&quot;. On solid cats, it turns the base of the hair pale, making them &quot;silver smoke&quot;. The term &quot;cameo&quot; is commonly used for red silver and cream silver (inhibitor gene (I-O-)) colored coats in cats.

=== Wide band factors ===
Silver agouti cats can have a range of phenotypes, from silver tabby, to silver shaded (under half the hair is pigmented, approx. 1/3 of hair length), to tipped silver also called chinchilla or shell (only the very tip of the hair is pigmented, approx. 1/8 of hair length). This seems to be affected by hypothetical &quot;wide band&quot; factors, which make the silver band at the base of the hair wider. Breeders often notate wide band as a single gene &quot;Wb/wb&quot;, but it is most likely a polygenic trait.

=== Golden series ===
If a cat has the wide band trait but no silver melanin inhibitor, the band will be golden instead of silver. These cats are known as golden tabbies, or in Siberian cats &quot;sunshine&quot; tabbies. The golden color is caused by the &quot;CORIN&quot; gene. Shaded golden and tipped golden are also possible, in the same hair length distribution as the silver-gene. However, there is no golden smoke, because the combination of wide band and nonagouti simply produces a solid cat.

=== Tipped or shaded cats ===
The genetics involved in producing the ideal tabby, , shaded, or smoke cat is complex. Not only are there many interacting genes, but genes sometimes do not express themselves fully, or conflict with one another. For example, the silver melanin inhibitor gene in some instances does not block pigment, resulting in a grayer undercoat, or in tarnishing (yellowish or rusty fur). The grayer undercoat is considered less desirable to fanciers.

Likewise, poorly-expressed non-agouti or over-expression of melanin inhibitor will cause a pale, washed out black smoke. Various polygenes (sets of related genes), epigenetic factors, or modifier genes, as yet unidentified, are believed to result in different phenotypes of coloration, some deemed more desirable than others by fanciers.

The genetic influences on tipped or shaded cats are:
* Agouti gene.
* Tabby pattern genes (such as Ta masking the tabby pattern).
* Silver/melanin inhibitor gene &quot;I/i&quot;.
* Golden &quot;CORIN&quot; gene.
* Factors affecting the number and width of bands of color on each hair, such as the hypothetical wide band gene &quot;wb&quot;. Resulting in shaded or tipped (chinchilla/shell) pigmentation.
* Factors affecting the amount and quality of eumelanin and/or phaeomelanin pigment expression (such as theorized rufousing factors)
* Genes causing sparkling appearance (such as &quot;glitter&quot; in the Bengal, &quot;satin&quot; in the Tennessee Rex, &quot;grizzle&quot; in the Chausie).
* Factors to clear up residual striping (hypothetical Chaos, Confusion, Unconfused, Erase, and Roan factors).


==Fever coat==

Fever coat is an effect known in domestic cats, where a pregnant female cat has a fever or is stressed, causing her unborn kittens&#x27; fur to develop a silver-type color (silver-grey, cream, or reddish) rather than what the kitten&#x27;s genetics would normally cause. After birth, over some weeks the silver fur is replaced naturally by fur colors according to the kitten&#x27;s genetics.

== Fur length and texture ==

=== Cat coat hair ===

Cat fur can be short, long, curly, or hairless. Most cats are short-haired, like their ancestor. The fur can naturally come in three types of hairs; guard, awn, and down hair. The length, density and proportions of these three hairs varies greatly between breeds, and in some cats only one or two types are found.

Most oriental breeds only express one single layer of silky coat. However, cats can also have double-layered coats out of two hair types in which the down hairs form the soft, insulating undercoat, and the guard hairs form the protective outer coat. 

A typical cat coat exists of all three natural hair types, but due to the equal lengths of two of these hairs, the coat is still considered double-layered. Typically, the down hairs comprise the undercoat while the guard and awn hairs make up the basic top coat. Double-coated cats with thick undercoats require daily grooming as these coats are more prone to matting. Double coats are found in for example the Persian, British Shorthair, Maine Coon and Norwegian Forest cat. 

Additionally, there even exist cats which express all three natural types of cat hair in different lengths and structures, which form three different layers. These cats are called triple-coated. Siberians and Neva Masquerades are known for their unique triple coats, which provides double insulation to withstand their natural cold climate.

=== Coat mutations ===
There have been many genes identified that result in unusual cat fur. These genes were discovered in random-bred cats and selected for. Some of the genes are in danger of going extinct because the cats are not sold beyond the region where the mutation originated or there is simply not enough demand for cats expressing the mutation.

In many breeds, coat gene mutations are unwelcome. An example is the rex allele which appeared in Maine Coons in the early 1990s. Rexes appeared in America, Germany and the UK, where one breeder caused consternation by calling them &quot;Maine Waves&quot;. Two UK breeders did test mating which indicated that this was probably a new rex mutation and that it was recessive. The density of the hair was similar to normally coated Maine Coons, but consisted only of down type hairs with a normal down type helical curl, which varied as in normal down hairs. Whiskers were more curved, but not curly. Maine Coons do not have awn hairs, and after moulting, the rexes had a very thin coat.

==== Fur length ====
Cat fur length is governed by the &quot;Length&quot; gene in which the dominant form, &quot;L&quot;, codes for short hair, and the recessive &quot;l&quot; codes for long hair. In the longhaired cat, the transition from anagen (hair growth) to catagen (cessation of hair growth) is delayed due to this mutation. A rare recessive shorthair gene has been observed in some lines of Persian cat (silvers) where two longhaired parents have produced shorthaired offspring.

The &quot;Length&quot; gene has been identified as the fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5; ) gene. The dominant allele codes for the short coat is seen in most cats. Long coats are coded for by at least four different recessively inherited mutations, the alleles of which have been identified. The most ubiquitous is found in most or all long haired breeds while the remaining three are found only in Ragdolls, Norwegian Forest Cats, and Maine Coons.
==== Curly-coated ====

There are various genes producing curly-coated or &quot;rex&quot; cats. New types of rex arise spontaneously in random-bred cats now and then. Some of the rex genes that breeders have selected for are:

* Devon Rex
** Mutation in &quot;KRT71&quot; (), the same gene causing hairlessness in Sphynx cats. &quot;re&quot; is an allele completely recessive to the wildtype and completely dominant to &quot;hr&quot; found in Sphynx.
* Cornish Rex
** Mutation in &quot;LPAR6&quot; (). A completely recessive allele termed &quot;r&quot;.
* Ural Rex
** Mutation in &quot;LIPH&quot;.
* German Rex
** Provisionally an allele termed &quot;gr&quot;. Same locus as Cornish, but proposed as a different allele. However, most breeders consider the German Rex to have &quot;r&quot;/&quot;r&quot; genotype.
* Oregon Rex (extinct)
** A hypothetical recessive allele termed &quot;ro&quot;.
* Selkirk Rex
** A dominant allele termed &quot;Se&quot;, although sometimes described as an incomplete dominant because the three possible allele pairings relate to three different phenotypes: heterozygous cats (&quot;Se/se&quot;) may have a fuller coat that is preferred in the show ring, while homozygous cats (&quot;Se/Se&quot;) may have a tighter curl and less coat volume. (&quot;se/se&quot; type cats have a normal coat.) This phenomenon may also colloquially be referred to as additive dominance.
* LaPerm
** Provisional completely dominant &quot;Lp&quot; allele.
==== Hairlessness ====
There are also genes for hairlessness:
* h=French hairless cat, recessive.
* hd=British hairless cat, recessive.
* Hp=Russian Donskoy and Peterbald, dominant.
* hr=Sphynx cat, recessive. Identified on KRT71.

Some rex cats are prone to temporary hairlessness, known as baldness, during moulting.

Here are a few other genes resulting in unusual fur:
* The Wh gene (dominant, possibly incomplete) results in Wirehair cats. They have bent or crooked hair producing springy, crinkled fur.
* A hypothetical Yuc gene, or York Chocolate undercoat gene, results in cats with no undercoat. However, the proportional relationship between guard, awn, and down hair production varies greatly between all breeds.
* A recessive autosomal gene for &quot;Onion hair&quot; which causes roughness and swelling on the hairs. The swelling is due to enlargement of the inner core of medulla cells.
* A recessive autosomal gene spf for &quot;sparse fur&quot;. As well as sparse coat, the hairs are thin, straggly and contorted and there is brown exudate around the eyes and nose and on the chest and stomach. A similar condition is linked to Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency in mice.

<doc id="583262" wikidata="Q1050099" url="?curid=583262" title="Cat Fanciers' Association">
<text>The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA) was established in the United States in 1906. The CFA is currently the world&#x27;s largest registry of pedigreed cats. Originally headquartered in Manasquan, New Jersey, the CFA moved to Alliance, Ohio in 2010. The association&#x27;s stated mission is preserving and promoting pedigreed breeds of cats while also enhancing the well-being of all cats. CFA&#x27;s first licensed cat shows were held in Buffalo, New York and Detroit, Michigan in 1906. The association today has a known presence in Europe, China, and Japan along with its well-established activity in the United States and Canada.

In 2022, CFA recognized 42 breeds for its Championship Class and three in its non-competitive classes (the Khao Manee, Lykoi, and Toybob). The current president of the CFA is Richard Mastin.

==List of CFA-recognized pedigreed cats==
By alphabetical order according to breed division:

* A - Abyssinian cat - American Bobtail - American Curl - American Shorthair - American Wirehair 
* B - Balinese (including Javanese) - Bengal - Birman - Bombay - British Shorthair - Burmese - Burmilla
* C - Chartreux - Colorpoint Shorthair - Cornish Rex
* D - Devon Rex
* E - Egyptian Mau - European Burmese - Exotic
* H - Havana Brown
* J - Japanese Bobtail
* K - Khao Manee - Korat
* L - LaPerm - Lykoi
* M - Maine Coon - Manx
* N - Norwegian Forest Cat
* O - Ocicat - Oriental
* P - Persian (including Himalayan)
* R - Ragamuffin - Ragdoll - Russian Blue
* S - Scottish Fold - Selkirk Rex - Siamese - Siberian - Singapura - Somali - Sphynx
* T - Toybob - Tonkinese - Turkish Angora - Turkish Van

==Services==
The CFA offers a number of services to catteries, purebred feline owners, and the general public. One service the CFA offers is certified pedigree lists for registered cats. Registered cat pedigrees going back from three to six generations are available.

==Catteries==
Breeding catteries register their cattery name following the CFA naming standards. Certificates are awarded to Catteries of Excellence that meet strict health codes for the cats and their environment. As of this writing, 40 catteries meet these requirements. Riversiderags is the only Ragdoll cattery at present to make this award from both TICA and CFA. 

PaJean Cattery, an iconic cattery devoted to Persian cats, has produced the most long-haired Grand Champions in the world and the most Cat of the Year honors. The cattery was founded by Pamela Bassett and her mother, the late Jean Bassett.

==Other activities==
CFA recognizes 42 pedigreed breeds for showing in the Championship Class and three breeds as Miscellaneous (this became effective with the 2016–17 show season). Since 1994, the CFA has hosted the CFA International Cat Show, described as the &quot;Rolls-Royce of cat shows&quot;, the largest of its kind in the U.S.. Despite being cancelled in 2007 and 2010, the CFA International made a comeback in 2011 as the CFA World Show in Indianapolis, Indiana and has boasted renewed entries and interest since its re-branding and the acquisition of corporate sponsorships. In 2015, the show&#x27;s name was restored to the CFA International Cat Show.

Other activities of the CFA include setting breed standards and offering breeding guidelines, training show judges, promoting and inspecting catteries, supporting and publicizing research on cat health issues, influencing legislative issues, providing disaster relief and breed rescue programs, publishing books and magazines and informing the general public on topics relating to cats.

==Description of CFA cat shows and titles==
While no two shows are identical, CFA cat shows follow certain procedures and guidelines:

A CFA cat show actually consists of a number of simultaneous cat shows running at the same time within the same place. Depending on the size of the show, there are anywhere from 4 to 12 &quot;rings&quot; (or miniature shows) which generally run 1 to 2 days in length. Each &quot;ring&quot; has its own judge who independently scores cats and awards the top 10 places (or top 15 depending on the size of the show).

Rings are of two kinds:

* &quot;All Breed&quot; rings allow cats of every breed approved by the CFA to be judged...from Sphynx to Persian and everything in between.
* &quot;Specialty&quot; rings separate out cats into one of two types: the &quot;Longhair&quot; category include cats like Persians, Maine Coons, and other long-haired cats, while the &quot;Shorthair&quot; include Burmese, Sphynx, American Shorthair and other short-haired cats.

Points are awarded to cats based on percentages of the number of cats &quot;beaten&quot; in the ring, determined according to their placement in the final (for national/regional points) or out of the number of champions/premiers in show (for grand points). 

* At the end of each show season, the top 25 cats in the organization with the most points for the show season are awarded the coveted title of &quot;National Winner&quot; (NW).
* Cats in the top 25 of their &quot;region&quot; are awarded the prestigious title of &quot;Regional Winner&quot; (RW). There are nine regions in the CFA, with regions 1-7 consisting of various American states and Canadian provinces, divided by geography and relative population, while regions 8 and 9 consist of the entirety of Japan and Europe, respectively. All other countries (including China) compete under the International Division.
* Adult cats who are not neutered and achieve a point ranking of over 200 points are awarded the title of &quot;Grand Champion&quot;.
* Neutered cats can be shown in a class called &quot;Premier&quot; and achieve the title of &quot;Grand Premier&quot;.
* Cats which meet the standards of the breed as confirmed by six judges at one show are awarded a &quot;winners ribbon&quot; by each judge and are awarded the lowest title of &quot;Champion&quot;.
* Kittens from the age of 4 to 8 months compete in a separate &quot;Kitten&quot; class, and are also able to achieve the title of &quot;National Winner&quot; and &quot;Regional Winner&quot;, but can not become Grand Champions or Grand Premiers until reaching adulthood at 8 months of age.
* Adult cats being shown at a show with no existing title are referred to as &quot;Open&quot;, although they are still eligible to compete for grand points.

<doc id="583263" wikidata="Q208231" url="?curid=583263" title="Deep Impact (spacecraft)">
<text>Deep Impact was a NASA space probe launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on January 12, 2005. It was designed to study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the Impactor successfully collided with the comet&#x27;s nucleus. The impact excavated debris from the interior of the nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.

Previous space missions to comets, such as &quot;Giotto&quot;, &quot;Deep Space 1&quot;, and &quot;Stardust&quot;, were fly-by missions. These missions were able to photograph and examine only the surfaces of cometary nuclei, and even then from considerable distances. The &quot;Deep Impact&quot; mission was the first to eject material from a comet&#x27;s surface, and the mission garnered considerable publicity from the media, international scientists, and amateur astronomers alike.

Upon the completion of its primary mission, proposals were made to further utilize the spacecraft. Consequently, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; flew by Earth on December 31, 2007, on its way to an extended mission, designated EPOXI, with a dual purpose to study extrasolar planets and comet Hartley 2 (103P/Hartley). Communication was unexpectedly lost in August 2013 while the craft was heading for another asteroid flyby.

==Scientific goals==
The &quot;Deep Impact&quot; mission was planned to help answer fundamental questions about comets, which included what makes up the composition of the comet&#x27;s nucleus, what depth the crater would reach from the impact, and where the comet originated in its formation. By observing the composition of the comet, astronomers hoped to determine how comets form based on the differences between the interior and exterior makeup of the comet. Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to answer these questions.

The mission&#x27;s Principal Investigator was Michael A&#x27;Hearn, an astronomer at the University of Maryland. He led the science team, which included members from Cornell University, University of Maryland, University of Arizona, Brown University, Belton Space Exploration Initiatives, JPL, University of Hawaii, SAIC, Ball Aerospace, and Max-Planck-Institut für extraterrestrische Physik.

==Spacecraft design and instrumentation==

The spacecraft consists of two main sections, the copper-core &quot;Smart Impactor&quot; that impacted the comet, and the &quot;Flyby&quot; section, which imaged the comet from a safe distance during the encounter with Tempel 1.

The Flyby spacecraft is about long, wide and high. It includes two solar panels, a debris shield, and several science instruments for imaging, infrared spectroscopy, and optical navigation to its destination near the comet. The spacecraft also carried two cameras, the High Resolution Imager (HRI), and the Medium Resolution Imager (MRI). The HRI is an imaging device that combines a visible-light camera with a filter wheel, and an imaging infrared spectrometer called the &quot;Spectral Imaging Module&quot; or SIM that operates on a spectral band from 1.05 to 4.8 micrometres. It has been optimized for observing the comet&#x27;s nucleus. The MRI is the backup device, and was used primarily for navigation during the final 10-day approach. It also has a filter wheel, with a slightly different set of filters.

The Impactor section of the spacecraft contains an instrument that is optically identical to the MRI, called the Impactor Targeting Sensor (ITS), but without the filter wheel. Its dual purpose was to sense the Impactor&#x27;s trajectory, which could then be adjusted up to four times between release and impact, and to image the comet from close range. As the Impactor neared the comet&#x27;s surface, this camera took high-resolution pictures of the nucleus (as good as ) that were transmitted in real-time to the Flyby spacecraft before it and the Impactor were destroyed. The final image taken by the Impactor was snapped only 3.7 seconds before impact.

The Impactor&#x27;s payload, dubbed the &quot;Cratering Mass&quot;, was 100% copper, with a weight of 100 kg. Including this cratering mass, copper formed 49% of total mass of the Impactor (with aluminium at 24% of the total mass); this was to minimize interference with scientific measurements. Since copper was not expected to be found on a comet, scientists could ignore copper&#x27;s signature in any spectrometer readings. Instead of using explosives, it was also cheaper to use copper as the payload.

Explosives would also have been superfluous. At its closing velocity of 10.2 km/s, the Impactor&#x27;s kinetic energy was equivalent to 4.8 tonnes of TNT, considerably more than its actual mass of only 372 kg.

The mission coincidentally shared its name with the 1998 film, &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, in which a comet strikes the Earth.
==Mission profile==
Following its launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station pad SLC-17B at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005, the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; spacecraft traveled in 174 days to reach comet Tempel 1 at a cruising speed of . Once the spacecraft reached the vicinity of the comet on July 3, 2005, it separated into the Impactor and Flyby sections. The Impactor used its thrusters to move into the path of the comet, impacting 24 hours later at a relative speed of . The Impactor delivered s of kinetic energy—the equivalent of 4.7 tons of TNT. Scientists believed that the energy of the high-velocity collision would be sufficient to excavate a crater up to wide, larger than the bowl of the Roman Colosseum. The size of the crater was still not known one year after the impact. The 2007 Stardust spacecraft&#x27;s NExT mission determined the crater&#x27;s diameter to be .

Just minutes after the impact, the Flyby probe passed by the nucleus at a close distance of , taking pictures of the crater position, the ejecta plume, and the entire cometary nucleus. The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based telescopes and orbital observatories, including &quot;Hubble&quot;, &quot;Chandra&quot;, &quot;Spitzer&quot;, and &quot;XMM-Newton&quot;. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe&#x27;s &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft, which was about from the comet at the time of impact. &quot;Rosetta&quot; determined the composition of the gas and dust cloud that was kicked up by the impact.

==Mission events==
===Before launch===
A comet-impact mission was first proposed to NASA in 1996, but at the time, NASA engineers were skeptical that the target could be hit. In 1999, a revised and technologically upgraded mission proposal, dubbed &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, was accepted and funded as part of NASA&#x27;s Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft. The two spacecraft (Impactor and Flyby) and the three main instruments were built and integrated by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies in Boulder, Colorado. Developing the software for the spacecraft took 18 months and the application code consisted of 20,000 lines and 19 different application threads. The total cost of developing the spacecraft and completing its mission reached .

===Launch and commissioning phase===
The probe was originally scheduled for launch on December 30, 2004, but NASA officials delayed its launch, in order to allow more time for testing the software. It was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on January 12, 2005, at 1:47 pm EST (1847 UTC) by a Delta II rocket.

&quot;Deep Impact&quot; state of health was uncertain during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The cause of the problem was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft&#x27;s RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft&#x27;s thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.

On February 11, 2005, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; rockets were fired as planned to correct the spacecraft&#x27;s course. This correction was so precise that the next planned correction maneuver on March 31, 2005, was unnecessary and canceled. The &quot;commissioning phase&quot; verified that all instruments were activated and checked out. During these tests it was found that the HRI images were not in focus after it underwent a bake-out period. After mission members investigated the problem, on June 9, 2005, it was announced that by using image processing software and the mathematical technique of deconvolution, the HRI images could be corrected to restore much of the resolution anticipated.

===Cruise phase===

The &quot;cruise phase&quot; began on March 25, 2005, immediately after the commissioning phase was completed. This phase continued until about 60 days before the encounter with comet Tempel 1. On April 25, 2005, the probe acquired the first image of its target at a distance of .

On May 4, 2005, the spacecraft executed its second trajectory correction maneuver. Burning its rocket engine for 95 seconds, the spacecraft speed was changed by . Rick Grammier, the project manager for the mission at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, reacted to the maneuver stating that &quot;spacecraft performance has been excellent, and this burn was no different... it was a textbook maneuver that placed us right on the money.&quot;

===Approach phase===
The approach phase extended from 60 days before encounter (May 5, 2005) until five days before encounter. Sixty days out was the earliest time that the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; spacecraft was expected to detect the comet with its MRI camera. In fact, the comet was spotted ahead of schedule, 69 days before impact (see Cruise phase above). This milestone marks the beginning of an intensive period of observations to refine knowledge of the comet&#x27;s orbit and study the comet&#x27;s rotation, activity, and dust environment.

On June 14 and 22, 2005, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; observed two outbursts of activity from the comet, the latter being six times larger than the former. The spacecraft studied the images of various distant stars to determine its current trajectory and position. Don Yeomans, a mission co-investigator for JPL pointed out that &quot;it takes 7½ minutes for the signal to get back to Earth, so you cannot joystick this thing. You have to rely on the fact that the Impactor is a smart spacecraft as is the Flyby spacecraft. So you have to build in the intelligence ahead of time and let it do its thing.&quot; On June 23, 2005, the first of the two final trajectory correct maneuvers (targeting maneuver) was successfully executed. A velocity change was needed to adjust the flight path towards the comet and target the Impactor at a window in space about wide.

===Impact phase===

Impact phase began nominally on June 29, 2005, five days before impact. The Impactor successfully separated from the Flyby spacecraft on July 3 at 6:00 UTC (6:07 UTC ERT). The first images from the instrumented Impactor were seen two hours after separation.

The Flyby spacecraft performed one of two divert maneuvers to avoid damage. A 14-minute burn was executed which slowed down the spacecraft. It was also reported that the communication link between the Flyby and the Impactor was functioning as expected. The Impactor executed three correction maneuvers in the final two hours before impact.

The Impactor was maneuvered to plant itself in front of the comet, so that Tempel 1 would collide with it. Impact occurred at 05:45 UTC (05:52 UTC ERT, +/− up to three minutes, one-way light time = 7m 26s) on the morning of July 4, 2005, within one second of the expected time for impact.

The impactor returned images as late as three seconds before impact. Most of the data captured was stored on board the Flyby spacecraft, which radioed approximately 4,500 images from the HRI, MRI, and ITS cameras to Earth over the next few days. The energy from the collision was similar in size to exploding five tons of dynamite and the comet shone six times brighter than normal.

A mission timeline is located at Impact Phase Timeline (NASA).
==Results==

Mission control did not become aware of the Impactor&#x27;s success until five minutes later at 05:57 UTC. Don Yeomans confirmed the results for the press, &quot;We hit it just exactly where we wanted to&quot; and JPL Director Charles Elachi stated &quot;The success exceeded our expectations.&quot;

In the post-impact briefing on July 4, 2005, at 08:00 UTC, the first processed images revealed existing craters on the comet. NASA scientists stated they could not see the new crater that had formed from the Impactor, but it was later discovered to be about 100 meters wide and up to deep. Lucy McFadden, one of the co-investigators of the impact, stated &quot;We didn&#x27;t expect the success of one part of the mission [bright dust cloud] to affect a second part [seeing the resultant crater]. But that is part of the fun of science, to meet with the unexpected.&quot; Analysis of data from the &quot;Swift&quot; X-ray telescope showed that the comet continued outgassing from the impact for 13 days, with a peak five days after impact. A total of of water and between of dust were lost from the impact.

Initial results were surprising as the material excavated by the impact contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets to determine if they share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced at the time of the Solar System&#x27;s formation.

Astronomers hypothesized, based on its interior chemistry, that the comet formed in the Uranus and Neptune Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms farther from the Sun is expected to have greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as ethane, which was present in Tempel 1. Astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to Tempel 1 are likely to have formed in the same region.

===Crater===
Because the quality of the images of the crater formed during the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; collision was not satisfactory, on July 3, 2007, NASA approved the New Exploration of Tempel 1 (or NExT) mission. The mission utilized the already existing &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft, which had studied Comet Wild 2 in 2004. &quot;Stardust&quot; was placed into a new orbit so that it passed by Tempel 1 at a distance of approximately on February 15, 2011, at 04:42 UTC. This was the first time that a comet was visited by two probes on separate occasions (1P/Halley had been visited by several probes within a few weeks in 1986), and it provided an opportunity to better observe the crater that was created by &quot;Deep Impact&quot; as well as observing the changes caused by the comet&#x27;s latest close approach to the Sun.

On February 15, NASA scientists identified the crater formed by &quot;Deep Impact&quot; in images from &quot;Stardust&quot;. The crater is estimated to be in diameter, and has a bright mound in the center likely created when material from the impact fell back into the crater.

==Public interest==

===Media coverage===

The impact was a substantial news event reported and discussed online, in print, and on television. There was a genuine suspense because experts held widely differing opinions over the result of the impact. Various experts debated whether the Impactor would go straight through the comet and out the other side, would create an impact crater, would open up a hole in the interior of the comet, and other theories. However, twenty-four hours before impact, the flight team at JPL began privately expressing a high level of confidence that, barring any unforeseen technical glitches, the spacecraft would intercept Tempel 1. One senior personnel member stated &quot;All we can do now is sit back and wait. Everything we can technically do to ensure impact has been done.&quot; In the final minutes as the Impactor hit the comet, more than 10,000 people watched the collision on a giant movie screen at Hawaii&#x27;s Waikīkī Beach.

Experts came up with a range of soundbites to summarize the mission to the public. Iwan Williams of Queen Mary University of London, said &quot;It was like a mosquito hitting a 747. What we&#x27;ve found is that the mosquito didn&#x27;t splat on the surface; it&#x27;s actually gone through the windscreen.&quot;

One day after the impact, Marina Bay, a Russian astrologer, sued NASA for for the impact which &quot;ruin[ed] the natural balance of forces in the universe.&quot; Her lawyer asked the public to volunteer to help in the claim by declaring &quot;The impact changed the magnetic properties of the comet, and this could have affected mobile telephony here on Earth. If your phone went down this morning, ask yourself Why? and then get in touch with us.&quot; On August 9, 2005, the Presnensky Court of Moscow ruled against Bay, although she did attempt to appeal the result. One Russian physicist said that the impact had no effect on Earth and &quot;the change to the orbit of the comet after the collision was only about 10 cm (3.9 in).&quot;

===Send Your Name To A Comet campaign===
The mission was notable for one of its promotional campaigns, &quot;Send Your Name To A Comet!&quot;. Visitors to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory&#x27;s website were invited to submit their name between May 2003 and January 2004, and the names gathered—some 625,000 in all—were then burnt onto a mini-CD, which was attached to the Impactor. Dr. Don Yeomans, a member of the spacecraft&#x27;s scientific team, stated &quot;this is an opportunity to become part of an extraordinary space mission ... when the craft is launched in December 2004, yours and the names of your loved-ones can hitch along for the ride and be part of what may be the best space fireworks show in history.&quot; The idea was credited with driving interest in the mission.

===Reaction from China===
Chinese researchers used the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; mission as an opportunity to highlight the efficiency of American science because public support ensured the possibility of funding long-term research. By contrast, &quot;in China, the public usually has no idea what our scientists are doing, and limited funding for the promotion of science weakens people&#x27;s enthusiasm for research.&quot;

Two days after the US mission succeeded in having a probe collide with a comet, China revealed a plan: landing a probe on a small comet or asteroid to push it off course. China said it would begin the mission after sending a probe to the Moon.

===Contributions from amateur astronomers===
Since observing time on large, professional telescopes such as Keck or &quot;Hubble&quot; is always scarce, the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; scientists called upon &quot;advanced amateur, student, and professional astronomers&quot; to use small telescopes to make long-term observations of the target comet before and after impact. The purpose of these observations was to look for &quot;volatile outgassing, dust coma development and dust production rates, dust tail development, and jet activity and outbursts.&quot; By mid-2007, amateur astronomers had submitted over a thousand CCD images of the comet.

One notable amateur observation was by students from schools in Hawaii, working with US and UK scientists, who during the press conference took live images using the Faulkes Automatic Telescope in Hawaii (the students operated the telescope over the Internet) and were one of the first groups to get images of the impact. One amateur astronomer reported seeing a structureless bright cloud around the comet, and an estimated 2 magnitude increase in brightness after the impact. Another amateur published a map of the crash area from NASA images.

===Musical tribute===
The &quot;Deep Impact&quot; mission coincided with celebrations in the Los Angeles area marking the 50th anniversary of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets becoming the first rock and roll single to reach No. 1 on the recording sales charts. Within 24 hours of the mission&#x27;s success, a 2-minute music video produced by Martin Lewis had been created using images of the impact itself combined with computer animation of the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe in flight, interspersed with footage of Bill Haley &amp; His Comets performing in 1955 and the surviving original members of The Comets performing in March 2005. The video was posted to NASA&#x27;s website for a couple of weeks afterwards.

On July 5, 2005, the surviving original members of The Comets (ranging in age from 71–84) performed a free concert for hundreds of employees of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to help them celebrate the mission&#x27;s success. This event received worldwide press attention. In February 2006, the International Astronomical Union citation that officially named asteroid 79896 Billhaley included a reference to the JPL concert.

==Extended mission==

&quot;Deep Impact&quot; embarked on an extended mission designated EPOXI (Extrasolar Planet Observation and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; Extended Investigation) to visit other comets, after being put to sleep in 2005 upon completion of the Tempel 1 mission.

===Comet Boethin plan===
Its first extended visit was to do a flyby of Comet Boethin, but with some complications. On July 21, 2005, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; executed a trajectory correction maneuver that allows the spacecraft to use Earth&#x27;s gravity to begin a new mission in a path towards another comet.

The original plan was for a December 5, 2008, flyby of Comet Boethin, coming within of the comet. Michael A&#x27;Hearn, the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; team leader, explained &quot;We propose to direct the spacecraft for a flyby of Comet Boethin to investigate whether the results found at Comet Tempel 1 are unique or are also found on other comets.&quot; The $40 million mission would provide about half of the information as the collision of Tempel 1 but at a fraction of the cost. &quot;Deep Impact&quot; would use its spectrometer to study the comet&#x27;s surface composition and its telescope for viewing the surface features.

However, as the December 2007 Earth gravity assist approached, astronomers were unable to locate Comet Boethin, which may have broken up into pieces too faint to be observed. Consequently, its orbit could not be calculated with sufficient precision to permit a flyby.

===Flyby of Comet Hartley 2===

In November 2007 the JPL team targeted &quot;Deep Impact&quot; toward Comet Hartley 2. However, this would require an extra two years of travel for &quot;Deep Impact&quot; (including earth gravity assists in December 2007 and December 2008). On May 28, 2010, a burn of 11.3 seconds was conducted, to enable the June 27 Earth fly-by to be optimized for the transit to Hartley 2 and fly-by on November 4. The velocity change was .

On November 4, 2010, the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; extended mission (EPOXI) returned images from comet Hartley 2. EPOXI came within of the comet, returning detailed photographs of the &quot;peanut&quot; shaped cometary nucleus and several bright jets. The probe&#x27;s medium-resolution instrument captured the photographs.

===Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1)===

&quot;Deep Impact&quot; observed Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, using its Medium Resolution Instrument, through a variety of filters. The comet was from the Sun and from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.

===Possible mission to asteroid (163249) 2002 GT===
At the end of 2011, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; was re-targeted towards asteroid (163249) 2002 GT which it would reach on January 4, 2020. At the time of re-targeting, whether or not a related science mission would be carried out in 2020 was yet to be determined, based on NASA&#x27;s budget and the health of the probe. A 71-second engine burn on October 4, 2012, changed the probe&#x27;s velocity by to keep the mission on track. Also, there was a 140-second burn on November 24, 2011. Distance of a flyby would not be more than 400 kilometers.

===Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON)===
In February 2013, &quot;Deep Impact&quot; observed Comet ISON. The comet remained observable until March 2013.

===Contact lost and end of mission===
On September 3, 2013, a mission update was posted to the EPOXI mission status website, stating &quot;Communication with the spacecraft was lost some time between August 11 and August 14 ... The last communication was on August 8. ... the team on August 30 determined the cause of the problem. The team is now trying to determine how best to try to recover communication.&quot;

On September 10, 2013, a &quot;Deep Impact&quot; mission status report explained that mission controllers believe the computers on the spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves and so are unable to issue any commands to the vehicle&#x27;s thrusters. As a result of this problem, communication with the spacecraft was explained to be more difficult, as the orientation of the vehicle&#x27;s antennas is unknown. Additionally, the solar panels on the vehicle may no longer be positioned correctly for generating power.

On September 20, 2013, NASA abandoned further attempts to contact the craft. According to chief scientist A&#x27;Hearn, the reason for the software malfunction was a Y2K-like problem. August 11, 2013, 00:38:49.6, was 232 tenth-seconds (deciseconds) from January 1, 2000, leading to speculation that a system on the craft tracked time in one-tenth second increments since January 1, 2000, and stored it in an unsigned 32-bit integer, which then overflowed at this time, similar to the Year 2038 problem.

<text>Vladimir-Rasate () was the ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire from 889 to 893.

==Biography==
In 853 or 854, the Bulgar Army led by Vladimir, the son of Boris I of Bulgaria, invaded Serbia in an attempt to exact vengeance for the previous defeat of Presian in 839-842 against Vlastimir. The Serbian Army, led by Mutimir and his brothers, defeated the Bulgars, capturing Vladimir and 12 boyars. Boris I and Mutimir agreed on peace (and perhaps an alliance), and Mutimir sent his sons Pribislav and Stefan to the border to escort the prisoners, where they exchanged items as a sign of peace. Boris gave them &quot;rich gifts&quot;, while he was given &quot;two slaves, two falcons, two dogs, and 80 furs&quot;.

Vladimir became ruler (Knyaz) of Bulgaria when his father Boris-Mihail I (Boris adopted the name Mihail - Michael - after his baptism) decided to retire to a monastery after a reign of 36 years. Preserved seals with the inscription &quot;Michael the Monk, who is archon of the Bulgarians&quot; suggest, however, that Boris I never fully relinquished his power.

Vladimir-Rasate was the oldest of Boris-Mihail&#x27;s sons and possibly the only one of them who had been born before Boris&#x27; adoption of Christianity. According to Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos, Vladimir had taken part in a Bulgarian invasion of the Serbian lands, predating the Christianization of Bulgaria. The little that is known about his reign includes a military alliance he concluded in 892 with the East Frankish (German) King Arnulf of Carinthia against Great Moravia which, having in mind the interests of the Byzantine Empire, was indirectly aimed against Constantinople. This was a serious straying from the pro-Byzantine policy of his father.

Vladimir is mainly remembered for his attempt to eliminate Christianity in Bulgaria and the re-institution of Paganism. This event is written of by Constantine of Preslav in his &quot;Didactic Gospel&quot;. Vladimir started the process of destroying the Christian temples and persecuting of the clergymen, because he regarded them as instruments of Byzantium and its efforts to influence the Bulgarian kingdom. Subsequently, in 893, Boris I angrily left the monastery and deposed his son then he blinded Vladimir and put him in a dungeon where his trails vanished.

Boris placed his third son Simeon on the Bulgarian throne during the Council of Preslav, itself a direct consequence of Vladimir-Rasate&#x27;s ill-fated attempt to restore paganism.

<text>The Central American Parliament (), also known as PARLACEN, is the political institution and parliamentary body of the Central American Integration System (SICA). Its headquarters are in Guatemala City.

== History ==

The PARLACEN origins date back to the Contadora Group, a project of the 1980s that sought to help resolve the civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Although the Contadora group was disbanded in 1986, the idea of a greater Central American integration remained, giving rise to the Esquipulas II Agreement, which among other things, created the Central American Parliament. The Treaty establishing the Central American Parliament and other political bodies was signed in 1987; its first formal session was carried out on 28 October 1991 in Guatemala City.

The PARLACEN as a political body in the region is part of the Central American Integration System SICA, established by the Protocol of Tegucigalpa to the Charter of the Organization of American States (ODECA) signed on 13 December 1991. SICA has the fundamental aim to realize an integration that is political and ideological representative in a pluralistic democratic system that guarantees free elections and participation under equal conditions for political parties.

The historic Declaration of Esquipulas I, which was adopted by the presidents of the Central American states in the city of Esquipulas (Guatemala) on 25 May 1986, included the following declaration: &quot;It is necessary to establish and complement activities that support understanding and cooperation with institutional structures. They shall make possible to strengthen the dialogue, the common development, democracy and pluralism as fundamental elements for peace in the region and the integration of Central America. Therefore the foundation of PARLACEN is necessary. Its members are elected freely by universal and direct elections through which the principle of political and participative pluralism is followed.&quot;

The agreement of PARLACEN and other political authorities was signed in October 1987 by Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras. In the beginning, it was an instrument which came into force for only three states (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) on 1 May 1990. PARLACEN was formed on 28 October 1991 and has its head office in Guatemala City, Republic of Guatemala.

The Legislative Yuan, Taiwan’s legislative body, was granted permanent observer status at PARLACEN in 1999. However PARLACEN signaled a shift in approach when on 28 April 2022 it made a statement to support a One China policy. The following year, on 21 August 2023, the PARLACEN Plenary Assembly voted to revoke the permanent observer status of Taiwan&#x27;s legislative body and include China’s National People’s Congress as a permanent observer instead. The vote was made at the request of the Nicaraguan delegation which argued that &quot;Taiwan lacks recognition as a sovereign state at the United Nations” and that the &quot;observer status that Taiwan holds at PARLACEN is illegitimate due to lack of legal status”, also noting a UN resolution concerning Chinese representation at the UN. The Chinese government welcomed the development.

== Legal status and mission ==

PARLACEN is the regional assembly of SICA and acts as a permanent political organ to represent opinions and to carry out analyses and discussions about political, economic and cultural affairs of common interest, of basic conditions for democracy, peace, and the integration of Central America, as well to work out initiatives for its realization. It is charged with furthering human rights and international law, to achieve a peaceful coexistence within the framework of security and social welfare, a mission which is well-founded in representative and participative democracy, in pluralism, and in respect for national legislation and international law.

PARLACEN has the status of a legal entity according to international law.

== Member states ==

The following countries comprise the PARLACEN:
* 
* 
* 

Between 1998 and 2010, the Dominican Republic sent 22 appointed members. Since 2010, it has been a full member of the Central American Parliament with delegates elected directly by universal suffrage. (See note)

=== Panama ===
President of Panama Ricardo Martinelli vowed he would remove Panama from PARLACEN, fulfilling a campaign promise. On 11 December 2009, law 78 passed withdrawing Panama from PARLACEN, but a resolution of the Central American Court of Justice declared the law unconstitutional. The court said there is no mechanism to withdraw from the PARLACEN and Panama could not opt out. In January 2012, the Panamanian Supreme Court re-affirmed that ruling and Panama returned to PARLACEN. Panama also showed more interest in membership after SICA signed a free trade agreement with the European Union.

The working committees of PARLACEN can be structured as follows.

Permanent commissions are established in the internal rules to work on affairs of the commission with unlimited duration. The permanent commissions are formed of at most two representatives per state, not exceeding twelve members in total.

Special commissions are established by the board of parliament to handle special affairs.

==== Parliamentary groups ====
The parliamentary groups monitor the political trend of the Central American representatives and are organized according to the political orientation of their groups.

The parliamentary groups are founded by the adoption of an internal statute by the plenary assembly. The board of parliament registers each parliamentary group. The statute is published and states the group&#x27;s ideological principles, the political objectives and the regulations.

There are three parliamentary groups: the Parliamentary Group of the Left, Center-Democratic Integration Group, and Democratic Integrationist Union.

=== Board of parliament ===

The board of parliament is the executive body for decisions that emerge from the Plenum and is the administrative body of PARLACEN. It is expandable according to its internal rules.

The board of parliament is elected from the members. Its term is one year, made up of one president, five vice-presidents, and six secretaries.

The board makes its decisions by approval of a majority of its members. In the event of a tie, the votes of the presidency count as qualified majority. The presidency is filled by a rota system corresponding to the alphabetical order of the member states, starting with the state which holds the head office.

It is possible to appeal any resolution at the Plenum.

The tasks of the board are
* Consideration and handling of all requests for which PARLACEN is in charge.
* Conveying of the invitations for the ordinary and extraordinary meetings of the Plenum of PARLACEN.
* Draft of the budget – designated in Central American Pesos – for the routine work of PARLACEN.
* Realizing the resolutions of PARLACEN.

* Dividing tasks among its members.
* Other tasks which are assigned to the board by the constitutive contract or by additional instruments.

=== Secretary office ===
The secretary office is the technical-administrative organ of PARLACEN and is divided into three sections, which have the following basic functions and responsibilities:

The secretary office for parliamentary affairs handles and obeys the decisions of PARLACEN. It reports to the Plenum on a regular basis and is of technical assistance to the Plenum as well as to the commissions in all of their activities. It coordinates and manages the advice of the commissions and has to assist the extended board with developing the agenda for Plenum meetings when necessary.

The secretary office for administration and finance has to administer all branches, manager&#x27;s offices, departments and administrative units, as well as the personnel of PARLACEN, and has to control the proper administration of its resources.

The secretary office of the board offers technical help to the board in questions relating to the responsibilities of and the topics determined by the board.

==Presidents of PARLACEN==
== Composition ==


== Elections ==
The 20 elected members representing every member state the Central American Parliament are elected at the same time as the presidential elections of the member state according to article 2 of the Internal Regulations of the Central American Parliament. The former president of every member state, as well as every vice-president and prime minister, are also de jure members of the PARLACEN from the end of their term till the end of their successor&#x27;s term.

== Effectiveness and challenges ==
Costa Rica, one of the wealthier countries in the region and an otherwise-active participant in the SICA, has not ratified the Esquipulas II agreement, and is not represented in the Parlacen. Parlacen is seen by some (including former President of Honduras Ricardo Maduro) as a white elephant.

== 2007 murder of parliamentary members ==

On February 19, 2007, a group of three Salvadoran representatives were murdered by four Guatemalan police officers, including the head of the Guatemalan National Police organized crime unit. The killers were arrested three days later and detained in a Guatemalan prison, where they were themselves murdered several days later by a group of gunmen disguised as prison guards. Guatemalan president Óscar Berger attributed the officers&#x27; murders to an apparent mafia hit aimed at hindering investigation into the representatives’ murders. The killings raised questions regarding corruption and drug trafficking in Central America as well as the high level of infiltration of the Guatemalan national police force by organized crime.

<text>Horace Parnell Tuttle (March 17, 1837 – August 16, 1923) was an American astronomer, an American Civil War veteran and brother of astronomer Charles Wesley Tuttle (November 1, 1829 – July 17, 1881).

==Biography==
===Early life===
H. P. Tuttle was born at Newfield, Maine. His parents were Moses Tuttle and Mary Merrow. In 1845 Mary Merrow died, and four years later Moses Tuttle remarried and moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Charles Wesley Tuttle was an amateur astronomer who constructed his own telescope, and on a visit to the Harvard Observatory so impressed William Cranch Bond that by 1850 he was hired as an assistant observer. At Harvard Charles Wesley first proposed the existence of the interior &quot;dusky ring&quot; of Saturn. In 1853 he discovered a comet (C/1853 E1 Secchi), with independent discovery credited to Father Secchi, Rome. The following year Charles Wesley was forced to give up his astronomical career because of failing eyesight. He entered Harvard Law School and became U. S. Commissioner. Charles wrote many articles for the New England Historic Genealogy Society.

Charles was soon replaced at Harvard by his younger brother Horace, who joined Truman Henry Safford, Sidney Coolidge, and Asaph Hall as observatory assistants. Horace became attached to a four-inch Merz comet seeker, which he placed on the balconies of the 15-inch refractor, spending many nights in search of new comets.

Horace Tuttle discovered or co-discovered numerous comets, including 55P/Tempel-Tuttle (parent body of the Leonid meteor shower, discovered by Tuttle January 6, 1866), and 109P/Swift-Tuttle (parent body of the Perseid meteor shower, disc. July 19, 1862), the &quot;Great Comet of 1860&quot;, C/1860 III (disc. June 22, 1860), C/1859 G1 Tempel (disc April 24, 1859). Other periodic comets that bear his name are 8P/Tuttle (parent comet of the Ursid meteor shower; disc. January 5, 1858 &quot;rather faint&quot;) and 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak (disc. May 3, 1858 in Leo Minor &quot;very faint&quot;), C/1861 Y1 Tuttle, (disc. December 19, 1862), C/1859 G1 Tempel (disc. April 28, 1859). The asteroid 5036 Tuttle was named in his honor. In 1859 he was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences for the discovery of comets 1858I, 1858III, and 1858VII.

Tuttle is credited with the discovery of galaxies NGC 2655 in Camelopardalis, and NGC 6643 in Draco.

He dabbled in applications of the new Morse Code, and invented a method of signaling long distances by &quot;light flashes&quot;. He is credited with inventing a new method for the insertion of rifled steel cores into brass or iron cannon.

His observing log books from this period are preserved at the library of the U.S. Naval Observatory.

===War service===

With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Horace Tuttle enlisted in the 44th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry and served at New Bern, North Carolina. It would be through the intervention of former Harvard president Edward Everett that Tuttle was given a commission in the U. S. Navy and as paymaster. He served on a number of vessels, including the monitor , where he participated in the blockade of Charleston Harbor and the capture of the blockade runner &quot;Deer&quot;. 
Tuttle was appointed acting assistant paymaster, February 17, 1863, assistant paymaster, July 2, 1864, and paymaster, May 4, 1866.

He continued to make astronomical observations during the war, reporting on the 1864 appearance of Comet Tempel 1864 II from the deck of the &quot;Catskill&quot;. After the war Tuttle was sent to South America, Europe, and the Pacific, making scientific observations on Naval survey vessels.

===Later life===

The war era had taken Tuttle out of cometseeking for three and a half years. His discovery of comet 1866 I at the Naval Observatory on January 5, 1866, must have brought him back to happier times. This was Comet Tempel-Tuttle, first seen by the French astronomer more than two weeks earlier. The Washington Star newspaper reported the event on page two:

This was only the second comet ever discovered at the Naval Observatory. The first was James Ferguson&#x27;s independent discovery of Comet Tempel 1859, which was also an independent discovery of H. P. Tuttle. In October, 1866 he was assigned to the &quot;Onward&quot;, South Atlantic Station. During the next four years he served on the monitors &quot;Guard&quot; and &quot;Terror&quot;.

On October 23, 1871, Tuttle independently recovered periodic comet 8/P1871 T1 Tuttle at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. In 1871 Tuttle served under Commodore George Dewey as astronomer on the survey of the coast of lower California. In 1872 he was assigned to the oceanographic survey ship &quot;Lackawanna&quot; at Hong Kong. 
On January 26, 1875, Tuttle and E. S. Holden recovered periodic comet 2P/Encke from the Naval Observatory. Tuttle was in Washington, DC attending a Naval court martial, his own in fact. He was dismissed from the Navy March 3, 1875.

Tuttle&#x27;s brother Francis served in the Navy as Mate and Acting Ensign from 1863 to 1870. As Captain of the US Revenue Cutter &quot;Bear&quot;, Francis Tuttle was ordered to the rescue of 14 ships of whalers trapped in ice off Point Barrow, Alaska, in 1897.

In 1875 Tuttle was appointed to the Interior Department&#x27;s geographic and geological survey of the Black Hills of Dakota to survey the state borders and measure heights of geological features. He spent the next five years on border surveys of Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, for the General Land Office.

In 1887 Tuttle had a 6.5-inch broken-back reflecting comet seeker made for him by John Brashear. It was installed &quot;on the tin roof of the Naval Observatory.&quot; A similar refractor cometseeker by Brashear is in the Naval Observatory collection. Here he made his last comet discovery, a recovery of Comet 1888V Barnard.

Tuttle lived in the Washington, D.C., area from about 1884 until his death from &quot;pulmonary edema&quot; in 1923. In his final years he was feeble and blind from a fall in November, 1921. His gravesite is unmarked, and its location in Oakwood Cemetery, Falls Church, is unknown.

<text>Limelight is a 1952 American comedy-drama film written, produced, directed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin, based on a novella by Chaplin titled &quot;Footlights&quot;. The score was composed by Chaplin and arranged by Ray Rasch.

The film stars Chaplin as a washed-up comedian who saves a suicidal dancer, played by Claire Bloom, from killing herself, and both try to get through life. Additional roles are provided by Nigel Bruce, Sydney Earl Chaplin, Wheeler Dryden, and Norman Lloyd, with an appearance by Buster Keaton. In dance scenes, Bloom is doubled by Melissa Hayden.

Upon the film&#x27;s release, critics&#x27; reception was divided; it was heavily boycotted in the United States because of Chaplin&#x27;s alleged communist sympathies, and failed commercially. However, the film was re-released in the United States in 1972, which included its first screening in Los Angeles. This allowed the two-decades-old film to be in contention for the 45th Academy Awards where Chaplin won his only competitive Oscar. Today, the film is sometimes regarded as one of Chaplin&#x27;s best and most personal works, and has attained a cult following.

== Plot ==

The movie is set in London in 1914, on the eve of World War I, and the year Chaplin made his first film, &quot;Making a Living&quot;. Calvero (Charlie Chaplin), once a famous stage clown, but now a washed-up drunk, saves a young dancer, Thereza &quot;Terry&quot; Ambrose (Claire Bloom), from a suicide attempt. Nursing her back to health, Calvero helps Terry regain her self-esteem and resume her dancing career. In doing so, he regains his own self-confidence, but an attempt to make a comeback is met with failure. Terry says she wants to marry Calvero despite their age difference; however, she has befriended Neville (Sydney Earl Chaplin), a young composer who Calvero believes would be better suited to her. In order to give them a chance, Calvero leaves home and becomes a street entertainer. Terry, now starring in her own show, eventually finds Calvero and persuades him to return to the stage for a benefit concert. Reunited with an old partner (Buster Keaton), Calvero gives an ambiguously triumphant comeback performance. At its end, he suffers a heart attack onstage and is placed on a cot. Anticipating his imminent death, Calvero asks to see Terry, who is the next act, dance. Carried to the wings, he appears not to open his eyes, and then dies as she dances.

== Cast ==
==Production==

Although the film is set in London, it was entirely filmed in the Hollywood area, mostly at the Chaplin Studios. The street where Calvero lives was a redressed set at Paramount Studios, the music hall scenes were filmed at RKO-Pathé studios, and some exterior scenes use back-projected footage of London. Filming took 55 days. Chaplin prominently featured members of his family in the film, including five of his children and his half-brother Wheeler Dryden. Chaplin chose stage actress Claire Bloom for the role of Terry, her first major film role. Chaplin told his older sons he expected &quot;Limelight&quot; to be his last film. By all accounts, he was very happy and energized during production, a fact often attributed to the joy of recreating his early career in the music hall. Chaplin biographers have assumed that his character in the film was based on his father, Charles Chaplin Sr., who had also lost his audience and became an alcoholic, which led to his death in 1901. In both his 1964 autobiography and his 1974 book, &quot;My Life in Pictures&quot;, however, Chaplin insists that Calvero is based on the life of stage actor Frank Tinney. &quot;Limelight&quot; was made during a time where Chaplin was starting to lose his audience, too; in many ways, the movie was highly autobiographical.

===Chaplin and Keaton collaboration===
The pairing of Chaplin and Buster Keaton in the final musical number is historic for being the only time the two performed together on film. Chaplin, at first, had not written the part for Keaton, because he believed that the role was too small. It was not until he learned that Keaton was going through hard times that Chaplin insisted Keaton be cast in the film: Before Limelight, Keaton had gone through a disastrous marriage, lost most of his fortune in the divorce process, and had appeared infrequently in films in the preceding years. 
A rumor has persisted, fueled by the intense rivalry among fans of the two comics, that Keaton gave such a superior performance that Chaplin jealously cut his scenes so he would not be upstaged by his rival. A close associate of Chaplin claimed that Chaplin not only did not feel threatened by Keaton&#x27;s performance, but also heavily edited his own footage of the duet while enhancing Keaton&#x27;s. According to Keaton&#x27;s biographer Rudi Blesh, Chaplin eased his notoriously rigid directorial style to give Keaton free rein to invent his own comic business during this sequence. Keaton&#x27;s widow Eleanor said that he was thrilled with his appearance in the film, and believed that his business partner, Raymond Rohauer, started and fueled the rumors. Chaplin&#x27;s son, Sydney, who also appeared in the film, said that even if some of Keaton&#x27;s best scenes were cut, which he did not believe, the storyline would not logically allow a supporting actor to suddenly appear and upstage the climactic comeback of Chaplin&#x27;s character.

While filming was underway, Chaplin&#x27;s friend and former publicist Harry Crocker invited a large number of reporters to the set to watch the actors work.

&quot;Limelight&quot; was one the first collaborations between Chaplin and Jerome Epstein, who would share a 30-year professional relationship and friendship. A movie executive counselled Epstein not to take a credit on &quot;Limelight&quot;, because it was made during the period in which Chaplin had become a target of McCarthyism.

==Release==
The film opened October 23, 1952 at the Astor Theatre and at the Trans-Lux 60th Street theatre in New York City and was shown for three months to good business.

Contemporary reviews found much to admire in the film, but commonly faulted it as excessively long and verbose. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a brilliant weaving of comic and tragic strands, eloquent, tearful and beguiling with supreme virtuosity,&quot; though he conceded, &quot;One tangible weakness of the film is the garrulous discussion of human foibles and paradoxes that Mr. Chaplin permits himself.&quot; Gene Arneel of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;As the focal character on the screen, Chaplin is, at times, magnificent. He has departed from the baggy-pants but still manages to work in some sock pantomime stuff. However, the role he gave himself calls for too much talk, and some of this grows tedious.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;an excellent human drama ... Chaplin does an outstanding job in every department, thus proving his genius. The one criticism that may be made is its excessive length; in some of the scenes Chaplin indulges in too much talk, preaching and moralizing in what impresses one as an attempt to get over his personal philosophy on life in general.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared, &quot;Mr. Chaplin&#x27;s gentle picture, over-long and under-disciplined it may be, restates the timeless lesson of human companionship that is the theme of philosophers and preachers. For all its shortcomings, &#x27;Limelight&#x27; is a creative, distinguished film.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;Regrettably, Mr. Chaplin isn&#x27;t as quick as Shakespeare in getting the point across. There are, however, rewarding flashes of the sort of comedy and pathos that distinguished Mr. Chaplin&#x27;s work in the past, and his portrait of an eminent performer who has fallen out of public favor carries a sad conviction.&quot; &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; of Britain wrote that the film &quot;is not perfect; it is perhaps ten minutes too long; there are moments when sentiment slips over into sentimentality. The weaknesses are slight and insignificant. The qualities of &quot;Limelight&quot; — the affection, the humour, the almost overpowering sadness in the portrayal of Calvero — are unerringly those of the screen&#x27;s greatest humanist.&quot;

The film inspired protests, in particular from the American Legion. Based on their protests, Charles Skouras, president of National Theatres and its subsidiary Fox West Coast Theatres blocked its release in Los Angeles.

While heading to Britain to promote the film, Chaplin learned that he had been refused a re-entry visa to the United States because of his alleged communist sympathies and the criticized nature of his recent personal life, and many American theaters refused to play &quot;Limelight&quot;. Outside of cinemas in several East Coast cities, the film was not seen by the American moviegoing public. It was not until 1972 that the film was finally seen in wide American release. &quot;Limelight&quot; currently holds an excellent 96% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was massively popular in Japan. It was enormously successful in Europe and around the world. However, in the U.S. it was a relative disappointment, only taking in $1 million.

&quot;Limelight&quot; enjoyed a cumulative worldwide gross of $8 million. Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance notes that the film&#x27;s reputation has slowly grown over the decades. Vance maintains &quot;&quot;Limelight&quot; is Chaplin&#x27;s last great film, and it plays like a self-conscious summing up of his life and career. As a journey back to his beginnings and an often rapier-sharp self-critique, &quot;Limelight&quot; is Chaplin&#x27;s most deeply personal and introspective film.&quot;

==Music==
The instrumental theme to the film, composed by Chaplin and titled &quot;The Terry Theme&quot;, was arranged for 40-piece orchestra with a large string section by Leon Young for Frank Chacksfield and issued by Decca Records in 1953. This disc won Chacksfield a gold disc in the United States, and in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart, and won him the &quot;NME&quot; award as &#x27;Record of the Year&#x27;. It spent eight weeks at No. 2 (an all-time UK chart record), and in all thirteen weeks in the top five chart positions 
With added lyrics by Geoff Parsons and John Turner, the theme was turned into a popular and often-covered song as &quot;Eternally&quot;.

In 1973, over 20 years after the film&#x27;s first release, Chaplin and his musical collaborators Raymond Rasch and Larry Russell were awarded an Oscar for Best Original Dramatic Score. In the case of Larry Russell, JazzWax journalist Marc Myers has written that this was a case of mistaken identity and Russell Garcia was the actual composer who should have been awarded the 1972 Oscar. Larry Russell&#x27;s family denies the report. Regardless, it was the only competitive Academy Award that Chaplin ever received (he had previously received two Honorary Oscars).

==Home media==
In 2000, &quot;Limelight&quot; was released in the United States on DVD from Image Entertainment, which later went out of print. In 2003, it was released on a special edition two-disc DVD set from Warner Home Video, which also later went out of print. The Criterion Collection released the film on both Blu-ray and DVD in the United States on May 19, 2015. A four-minute scene, featuring Stapleton Kent as an armless violin player, had been cut for the film&#x27;s worldwide release, but was included in the set as a bonus feature. This scene was also included as an extra on the Image DVD release. The only home video release that contains the full-length uncut American theatrical premiere version with the deleted scene intact is the 1993 laserdisc release on the CBS/Fox Video label, which was prepared by film restorationist David Shepard.

==Legacy==
The sixtieth anniversary of &quot;Limelight&quot; was celebrated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences with a reception, panel, and film screening at their Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, on October 3, 2012. Cast members Claire Bloom and Norman Lloyd shared their recollections in a conversation moderated by Chaplin biographer and archivist Jeffrey Vance.

<text>The first modern Farmer–Labor Party in the United States emerged in Minnesota in 1918. The American entry into World War I caused agricultural prices and workers&#x27; wages to fall, while retail prices rose sharply during the war years. Consequently, farmers and workers made common cause in the political sphere to redress their grievances.

The party dissolved in 1936 and was succeeded by the Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party.

==Labor Party of the United States==
One primary contributing stream to the Farmer–Labor movement was the Labor Party movement. An International Association of Machinists strike in Bridgeport developed into a Labor Party in five Connecticut towns in the summer of 1918 and the powerful Chicago Federation of Labor (led by President John Fitzpatrick and Secretary-Treasurer Edward Nockels) adopted the cause of a Labor Party in the fall of that same year. Similar independent Labor Party movements emerged in New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Ohio, and North Dakota. These state and local organizations joined in November 1919 in Chicago to form the Labor Party of the United States.

One important gathering that was a precursor to the establishment of a national Farmer–Labor Party was the Cooperative Congress, held in Chicago on February 12, 1920. The gathering included participants from the cooperative movement, farmers organizations, trade unions, and the Plumb Plan League. The congress elected a 12-person All-American Farmer–Labor Cooperative Commission. The event was closely reported in the pages of &quot;The Liberator&quot; by Robert Minor.

== Farmer–Labor Party of the United States ==
In July 1920, the Labor Party of the United States changed its name to the Farmer–Labor Party. It nominated Utah lawyer Parley P. Christensen for President of the United States. Christensen finished particularly strongly in Washington, netting over 77,000 votes in that state alone. In total, Christensen received over 265,000 votes from voters of the 19 states in which the Farmer–Labor Party was on the ballot.
Also during the 1920 election, the Farmer–Labor Party candidate for the United States Senate in Washington state, C. L. France received 25% of the vote, coming in second place. This was the best performance by the Farmer–Labor Party in a state election outside Minnesota, which would soon become its main stronghold. The party&#x27;s candidate for Governor of New York was Dudley Field Malone, a former Democratic Collector of the Port of New York, who achieved 69,908 votes in the state election, versus 159,804 for the Socialist candidate Joseph D. Cannon. However Rose Schneiderman, the party&#x27;s candidate for U.S. Senator from New York only received 15,086 votes versus 151,246 for Socialist Jacob Panken.

In November 1921, as part of a lengthy world tour, Parley Parker Christensen obtained two interviews with Vladimir Lenin in Moscow. The official organ of the Farmer–Labor Party was a newspaper published in Chicago called &quot;The New Majority&quot;. Editor of this paper was Robert Buck, a Fitzpatrick-Nockles loyalist.

The 1922 Convention of the Farmer–Labor Party was attended by 72 delegates, representing organizations in 17 states. Victor Berger, Seymour Stedman, and Otto Branstetter attended the proceedings as fraternal delegates of the Socialist Party of America. The convention decided to transform the FLP organization into a federated body of labor organizations on the model of the British Labour Party.

The Farmer–Labor Party sent delegates to the second conference of the Conference for Progressive Political Action, which met December 11–12, 1922, in Cleveland. The conference defeated a motion to establish an independent political party by a vote of 52–64, with the Socialist and Farmer–Labor Party delegations on the short side. At the close of the conference, the Farmer–Labor Party delegation announced that they would no longer affiliate with the CPPA.

In March 1923, the Farmer–Labor Party of Chicago broke away from the CPPA and decided to proceed to the immediate formation of a national Farmer–Labor political organization. Circa May, over the signature of J.G. Brown of the Farmer–Labor Party of the United States there was issued a call for a &quot;Monster Political Convention of the Workers of America&quot; to meet in Chicago on July 3. The convention call was issued to trade unions, state Farmer–Labor Parties, the Non-Partisan League, the Socialist Party, and the Workers Party, The FLP was frustrated with the timidity of the CPPA and the refusal of that organization to enter into independent electoral politics and sought to establish a national organization through other means. The Workers Party was anxious to participate in the FLP Convention as part of their united front strategy. The Socialist Party on the other hand, was extremely hesitant. The SPA carefully considered this matter at its May 19–23, 1923, New York Convention before declining to participate in the FLP Convention, instead seeing the CPPA as the vehicle for a new Labor Party.

In the middle of June 1923, a subcommittee of the Central Executive Committee of the Workers Party of America met with a sub-committee of the Farmer–Labor Party. These two small groups agreed that if sufficient workers should be represented by delegates to the July 3 Conference, the Farmer–Labor Party should be supplanted by a Federated Farmer–Labor Party, and the National Committee of the Farmer–Labor Party replaced by a new National Executive Committee. The number of organizational members sending delegates necessary for the critical mass necessary to trigger this transformation was agreed by the two subcommittees to be 500,000. It was also agreed that the July 3 Conference should pass a general statement of principles and a resolution calling for the recognition of the Soviet Union. If the 500,000 threshold was not achieved, an Organization Committee for the new federated FLP would instead be established.

== Federated Farmer–Labor Party ==

The July 1923 Conference of the FLP was attended by approximately 540 delegates. The Workers Party seems to have made every effort to capture a majority at the gathering. At the convention itself, it used a disciplined caucus system, with groups of ten on the floor led by a group captain. The Workers Party delegates to the July 3 Conference were guided by a steering committee of the Central Executive Committee. During debate on the organization plan at the conference, C.E. Ruthenberg made a speech in which he asked the Farmer–Labor Party delegates what they wanted, stating that any concessions would be agreed to save the sacrifice of a federated Farmer–Labor Party itself. Five out of seven seats on the National Executive Committee of the new organization were offered to the Farmer–Labor Party. In response, the convention was adjourned and the Farmer–Labor Party delegates went into a closed caucus. This caucus returned with a resolution proposing to exclude the Workers Party from the conference and to ask the conference to accept the 1921 program and constitution of the Farmer–Labor Party without changes. This proposal was made on the floor of the conference by John Fitzpatrick of the Chicago Federation of Labor, who stated that &quot;it would be suicide&quot; to unite &quot;with any organization which advocated other than lawful means to bring about a political change.&quot; This resolution was tabled by a vote of approximately 500–40, prompting a walkout by John Fitzpatrick and a group of delegates sharing his views.

The Workers Party gained a majority for its program and established a &quot;Federated Farmer–Labor Party&quot; at this convention. Structural iron worker Joseph Manley, a son-in-law of William Z. Foster although a factional loyalist to John Pepper, was elected as National Secretary of the organization. The WPA&#x27;s Chicago labor paper, The Voice of Labor, was turned over to the FFLP and became its official organ, The Farmer–Labor Voice.

The notion of a &quot;Federated Farmer–Labor Party&quot; closely paralleled the organizational ideal for a third party then currently being advanced, the Socialist Party—an organization modelled upon the British Labour Party to which political organizations (like the WPA and the SPA) might affiliate without losing their independent organizational identity. The Socialist Party sought the establishment of an American &quot;Labor Party&quot; via the CPPA—and failed. The Workers Party successfully &quot;captured&quot; the Farmer–Labor Party organization, only to lose the allegiance of the mass organizations with which they so eagerly desired to unite.

== 1924 conferences ==

A Conference of the Farmer–Labor Party was held in St. Paul on March 11–12, 1924, at which it was decided to hold its next National Convention on June 17 in that same city. A convention call was issued for that gathering, which called for farmer, labor, and political organizations to send delegates provided that they subscribed to a five-point &quot;tentative program&quot; that called for public ownership, government banking, public control of all natural resources, restoration of civil liberties, and the abolition of the use of the injunction in labor disputes.

An effort was made by some members of the Farmer–Labor Party of the United States to merge the convention of the FLP with that of the Conference for Progressive Political Action, an attempt which was unsuccessful. This group also attempted to remove all national political parties from the convention call—the intended effect being to exclude the Workers (Communist) Party from participation. This effort failed as well.

There was pressure placed on the Farmer–Labor Party to purge itself of Communists and to postpone its next convention until July 4, 1924, so that it might meet jointly with that of the Conference for Progressive Political Action. On March 18, 1924, National Secretary Jay G. Brown wrote to the National Committee asking for a vote on the question of holding a convention on July 4 at Cleveland. This convention was not called. Brown resigned as National Secretary, to be replaced on a temporary basis by Robert M. Buck, who soon resigned as well. National Chairman W.M. Piggott then appointed Bert Martin as National Secretary and headquarters were moved from Chicago to Denver.

The June 1924 Convention of the Farmer–Labor Party (in which the Federated Farmer–Labor Party participated as a member organization) was attended by over 500 delegates representing 26 states. The convention discussed the upcoming run of Sen. Robert M. La Follette for president. La Follette, a bitter opponent of the Workers Party of America, did not seek the endorsement of the convention, which proceeded to nominate its own candidates for President and Vice President of the United States—Duncan McDonald and William Bouck, respectively. The National Committee of the FLP met in Cleveland on July 4 and elected delegates to the Conference for Progressive Political Action. W.M. Piggott of Utah was re-elected as National Chairman and Bert Martin of Denver as National Secretary. On July 10, 1924, after the endorsement of La Follette by the CPPA at Cleveland, a majority of the National Executive Committee withdrew the nominations of MacDonald and Bouck and pledged support to an independent campaign of the Workers Party. By the end of 1924, the Federated FLP had ceased to exist.

== National Farmer–Labor Party ==
The demise of the Federated Farmer–Labor Party did not mean an end to the Farmer–Labor Party movement, however. The regular Farmer–Labor Party continued to exist at the state level, with state and local organizations in Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, Illinois, Kentucky, Montana, New York, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Missouri, Washington, the Dakotas, and elsewhere. The national organization continued under the leadership of National Chairman W.M. Piggott and National Secretary Bert Miller. The group&#x27;s 1920 Presidential candidate, Parley Parker Christensen, attended the Dec. 12, 1924, meeting of the National Committee of the Conference for Progressive Political Action and was made a member of the committee of arrangements for the CPPA&#x27;s forthcoming February 21–22, 1925, conference. A Convention of the loyal members of the Farmer–Labor Party was called for that same time and place, where it aimed to cooperate with the CPPA in the formation of a labor party.

There were subsequent attempts to reconstitute a national Farmer–Labor Party into the 1930s, without the participation of either the CPUSA or the Socialist Party. Frank Webb was the remnant party&#x27;s candidate in 1928. For the 1932 Presidential election, Jacob Coxey campaigned as the Farmer–Labor Party candidate in a few states. In neither election did the party receive more than 8,000 votes.

==Congressmen and Senators==
The Farmer–Labor Party continued to exist as a successful state party in Minnesota until 1944, when it merged with the Democratic Party of that state to form the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL). Minnesota elected Farmer-Labor candidates to the United States House of Representatives in all but one election between 1918 and 1942:

:1918 – 1 seat
:1920 – No seats
:1922 – 2 seats
:1924 – 3 seats
:1926 – 2 seats
:1928 – 1 seat
:1930 – 1 seat
:1932 – 5 seats
:1934 – 3 seats
:1936 – 5 seats
:1938 – 1 seat
:1940 – 1 seat
:1942 – 1 seat

During the same period, Minnesota was represented in the United States Senate at various times by four Farmer-Labor senators, either for full terms or partial terms:

:Henrik Shipstead – March 4, 1923, to January 3, 1947
:Magnus Johnson – July 16, 1923, to March 4, 1925
:Elmer Austin Benson – December 27, 1935, to November 3, 1936
:Ernest Lundeen – January 3, 1937 to August 31, 1940

==In song==
Folksinger and Farmer-Labor supporter Jim Garland wrote the song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want Your Millions, Mister,&quot; in which he sings, &quot;Take the two old parties, mister,/No difference in them I can see./But with a Farmer-Labor party,/We will set the workers free.&quot;

Woody Guthrie wrote lyrics for a song &quot;Farmer-Labor Train&quot; with the tune from the &quot;Wabash Cannonball&quot; and performed it on August 29, 1942, on &quot;Labor for Victory,&quot; a joint AFL and CIO on NBC Radio&#x27;s Red Network. In 1948 transformed into &quot;The Wallace-Taylor Train&quot; for the 1948 Progressive National Convention of July 22–25, 1948, which nominated former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace for U.S. president against Harry S. Truman (Democrats), Strom Thurmond (Dixiecrats), and Thomas E. Dewey (Republicans).

<text>Whitby, a large suburb of Porirua City, New Zealand, located along much of the southern shore of the Pauatahanui Inlet of Porirua Harbour was comprehensively planned in the 1960s (when still in Hutt County) and it has been continuously developed since, with current landscaping and expansion in the hills behind the eastern part of Whitby to facilitate the future growth of the suburb.

The name of the suburb itself, as well as the nautical theme of neighbourhood and street names, are drawn from the life and career of the Pacific explorer James Cook. The bicentennial of his first (1769) visit to New Zealand occurred when the development of Whitby started.

The suburb is commercially centred on the Whitby Shopping Centre, containing almost all the retail businesses in Whitby.

==History==
In 1967 some 3,180 acres (1,290 ha) of farmland was purchased by a consortium for a new residential development, to be similar to North American new towns; with a population growing to 16,000 in four &quot;neighbourhoods&quot;, each focussed on a primary school. Following a town planning appeal hearing in 1974 this became two &quot;neighbourhoods&quot;, Adventure and Endeavour.

The first sections in the 01 subdivision were sold by auction in 1970. By May 1971 eight homes were occupied (5 Spinnaker Drive was first); and by 1972, 203 sections had been sold and 62 of the 117 houses built were occupied. By 1998 some 2000 houses had been built. The consortium developed a village centre and a golf course, and operated a commuter bus service from 1 February 1973. The New Zealand Institution of Engineers gave the development their 1978 Environmental Award for an engineering work exemplifying care for and consideration of environmental values.

The original area was part of the Horokiri riding of Hutt County, and some of the later land was in Porirua City. In 1988 the Local Government Commission decided that all of Whitby should come under the Porirua City Council. The Community Developments Consortium (originally Huapai Properties) had partners Fletcher Mainline, Jubilee Investments (part of the Todd Group) and the National Mutual Life Association.

<text>55P/Tempel–Tuttle (commonly known as Comet Tempel–Tuttle) is a retrograde periodic comet with an orbital period of 33 years. It fits the classical definition of a Halley-type comet with a period of between 20 and 200 years. It was independently discovered by Wilhelm Tempel on 19 December 1865, and by Horace Parnell Tuttle on 6 January 1866. It is the parent body of the Leonid meteor shower.

==Characteristics==
The nucleus of the comet was observed by Hubble Space Telescope during the 1998 apparition, and assuming an albedo of 0.04, its nucleus was estimated to have a mean radius of 1.8 km. The nucleus has a reddish color, with a B−V 0.75 ± 0.05 and V−R 0.51 ± 0.05. A jet was observed emanating from the nucleus and based on its movement the rotation period was calculated to be 15.31 ± 0.03 and 14.79 ± 0.02 hours. 

The spectrum of the comet revealed the presence of diatomic carbon, NH2 and [Oi]. The relative production rates indicate that the comet is depleted in diatomic carbon when compared with Halley&#x27;s comet. The gas-to-dust ratio also indicated it was gas rich compared with Halley&#x27;s comet. The infrared spectrum of the comet closely resembled that of a black body with a temperature of 330 K and lacked silicate emission that has been detected in other comets.

William Huggins observed the spectrum of the comet in January 1866, making it the second time spectrographic observations of a comet were obtained.

==Sightings==
In 1699, it was observed by Gottfried Kirch but was not recognized as a periodic comet until the discoveries by Tempel and Tuttle during the 1866 perihelion. In 1933, S. Kanda deduced that the comet of 1366 was Tempel–Tuttle, which was confirmed by Joachim Schubart in 1965. On 26 October 1366, the comet passed from Earth. It is possible the comet was also observed in October 1234, however it is only mentioned briefly by a single Japanese source, and also a comet observed in China in January 1035 could be comet Temple–Tuttle, however unless it had undergone a major outburst, it would have been too dim to observe with the naked eye.

Comet Tempel–Tuttle was recovered by J. Schubart in images taken by Michiel John Bester on 30 June 1965 using the 10-inch telescope of Boyden Observatory, South Africa. At that time the comet had an apparent magnitude of 16. The presence of the comet was confirmed in plates obtained by Palomar Observatory on 30 June. These were the only two observations of the comet during the 1965 apparition.

The comet was recovered on 4 March 1997 by Karen Meech, Olivier Hainaut and James &quot;Gerbs&quot; Bauer, at the University of Hawai`i. At the time it was very faint (22.5 mag), but the recovery proved that it was returning on schedule and that its orbit was very well determined. During the 1998 apparition the comet brightened more than predicted and reached an apparent magnitude of 7.4–7.8 in late February and could be observed with binoculars. It was last observed on 5 July 1998.

==Orbit==
The retrograde orbit of 55P/Tempel–Tuttle causes meteors to impact Earth at a high speed of 70 km/s. The orbit intersects that of Earth nearly exactly, hence streams of material ejected from the comet during perihelion passages do not have to spread out much over time to encounter Earth. The comet currently has an Earth-MOID of . This coincidence means that past streams from the comet at perihelion are still dense when they encounter Earth, resulting in the 33-year cycle of Leonid meteor storms. For example, the 1833 meteor storm was created by the previous 1800 perihelion passage. Between 2021–2030, Earth will often pass through the meteoroid stream left behind from the 1733 orbit.

55P/Tempel–Tuttle is estimated to have a nucleus of mass 1.2 kg and radius 1.8 km and a stream of mass 5 kg.

<text>The Mitsubishi F1M (Allied reporting name &quot;Pete&quot;) is a Japanese reconnaissance floatplane of World War II. It was the last biplane type of the Imperial Japanese Navy, with 944 built between 1936 and 1944. The Navy designation was &quot;Type Zero Observation Seaplane&quot; (零式水上観測機).

==Design and development==
In 1934, the Imperial Japanese Navy issued a specification to Mitsubishi, Aichi and Kawanishi for a replacement for its Nakajima E8N floatplanes, which were used for short-ranged reconnaissance and observation missions from the Navy&#x27;s warships. Mitsubishi&#x27;s design, the Ka-17, given the short system designation F1M1 by the Japanese Navy, was a small all-metal biplane powered by a single Nakajima Hikari 1 radial engine rated at , the same engine as used by Aichi&#x27;s competing F1A. It had elliptical wings and great care had been taken to reduce drag, with the number of interplane struts and bracing wires minimised. The first of four F1M1s flew in June 1936.

While the F1M1 had better performance than the Aichi aircraft, it had poor stability both on the water and in the air, so the aircraft was redesigned to resolve these problems. The wings were redesigned, with straight tapered leading and trailing edges and rigged with greater dihedral, and the vertical fin and rudder were enlarged. The aircraft&#x27;s floats were enlarged to increase buoyancy, and the Hikari engine was replaced by a Mitsubishi Zuisei 14-cylinder radial, giving better forward visibility. As modified, the aircraft&#x27;s handling characteristics were greatly improved, and the modified aircraft was ordered into production as the Navy Type 0 observation seaplane Model 11 (&quot;rei-shiki kansokuki ichi-ichi-gata&quot;, &quot;Reikan&quot; in short), with the short designation F1M2. 940 series aircraft were built in total (342 by Mitsubishi and 598 by Sasebo Arsenal and 21st Arsenal) in addition to 4 prototypes (older publications present higher production figures, i.e., 1,016 or 1,118).

The F1M2 had a maximum speed of 368 km/h (230 mph) and operating range of up to 1,072 km (670 mi) without external stores. An F1M airframe had a projected operational life of 350 flight hours, after which it needed replacing.

It provided the Imperial Japanese Navy with a very versatile operations platform.

The F1M was armed with a maximum of three 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns (two fixed forward-firing and one flexible rear-firing) with provision for two 60 kg (132 lb) bombs.

==Operational history==

The F1M was originally built as a catapult-launched reconnaissance float plane, specializing in gunnery spotting. The &quot;Pete&quot; took on a number of local roles including convoy escort, bomber, anti-submarine, maritime patrol, rescue, transport, and anti-shipping strike; for example sinking Motor Torpedo Boat PT-34 on 9 April 1942. The type was also used as an area-defense fighter and engaged in aerial combat in the Aleutians, the Solomons and several other theaters. In the New Guinea front, it was often used in aerial combat with the Allied bombers and Allied fighters.

In 1945, at the war&#x27;s end, Indonesians had taken some F1M2s to fight against the Dutch during the Indonesian National Revolution.

==Surviving aircraft==
In February 2023, four Mitsubishi F1M went on auction in the United States after being stored for more than 20 years.

<text>Tempel 1 (official designation: 9P/Tempel) is a periodic Jupiter-family comet discovered by Wilhelm Tempel in 1867. It completes an orbit of the Sun every 5.6 years. Tempel 1 was the target of the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; space mission, which photographed a deliberate high-speed impact upon the comet in 2005. It was re-visited by the &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft on February 14, 2011, and came back to perihelion in August 2016. On 26 May 2024, it will make a modest approach of 0.55 AU to Jupiter which will lift the perihelion distance and 9P will next come to perihelion on 12 February 2028 when it will be 1.77 AU from the Sun.

==Discovery and orbital history==
Tempel 1 was discovered on April 3, 1867, by Wilhelm Tempel, who was working at Marseille. At the time of discovery, it approached perihelion once every 5.68 years (designations 9P/1867 G1 and 1867 II). It was subsequently observed in 1873 (9P/1873 G1, 1873 I, 1873a) and in 1879 (1879 III, 1879b).

Photographic attempts during 1898 and 1905 failed to recover the comet, and astronomers surmised that it had disintegrated, when in reality, its orbit had changed. Tempel 1&#x27;s orbit occasionally brings it sufficiently close to Jupiter to be altered, with a consequent change in the comet&#x27;s orbital period. This occurred in 1881 (closest approach to Jupiter of 0.55 AU), lengthening the orbital period to 6.5 years. Perihelion also changed, increasing by 50 million kilometres, to 2.1 AU, rendering the comet far less visible from Earth. Perihelion did not drop below 2 AU until 1944 after a 1941 approach to Jupiter.

Tempel 1 was rediscovered in 1967 (as 9P/1967 L1, 1966 VII) after British astronomer Brian G. Marsden performed precise calculations of the comet&#x27;s orbit that took into account Jupiter&#x27;s perturbations. Marsden found that further close approaches to Jupiter in 1941 (0.41 AU) and 1953 (0.77 AU) had decreased both the perihelion distance and the orbital period to values smaller than when the comet was initially discovered (5.84 and 5.55 years, respectively). These approaches moved Tempel 1 into its present libration around the 1:2 resonance with Jupiter. Despite an unfavorable 1967 return, Elizabeth Roemer of the Catalina Observatory took several photographs. Initial inspection revealed nothing, but in late 1968 she found a June 8, 1967 exposure (Tempel 1 had passed perihelion in January) that held the image of an 18th magnitude diffuse object very close to where Marsden had predicted the comet to be. At least two images are required for orbit computation, so the next return had to be awaited.

Roemer and L. M. Vaughn recovered the comet on January 11, 1972, from Steward Observatory (9P/1972 A1, 1972 V, 1972a). The comet became widely observed, reached a maximum brightness of magnitude 11 during May, and was last seen on July 10. Since that time the comet has been seen at every apparition, in 1978 (1978 II, 1977i), 1983 (1983 XI, 1982j), 1989 (1989 I, 1987e1), 1994 (1994 XIUX, 1993c), 2000, and 2005.

==Physical characteristics==

Tempel 1 is not a bright comet; its brightest apparent magnitude since discovery has been 11, far below naked-eye visibility. Its nucleus measures . Measurements taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in visible light and the Spitzer Space Telescope in infrared light suggest a low albedo of only 4%. A two-day rotation rate was also determined. The comet was also seen to emit x-rays due to highly charged solar wind ions removing electrons via charge exchange from gases outflowing from Tempel 1&#x27;s nucleus.

==Exploration==
===&quot;Deep Impact&quot; space mission===

On 4 July 2005 at 05:52 UTC (01:52 EDT), Tempel 1 was deliberately struck by one component of the NASA &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe, one day before perihelion. The impact was photographed by the other component of the probe, which recorded a bright spray from the impact site. The impact was also observed by earthbound and space telescopes, which recorded a brightening of several magnitudes.

The crater that formed was not visible to &quot;Deep Impact&quot; due to the cloud of dust raised by the impact, but was estimated to be between 100 and 250 meters in diameter and 30 meters deep. Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the ejecta detected dust particles finer than human hair and discovered the presence of silicates, carbonates, smectite, metal sulfides (such as fool&#x27;s gold), amorphous carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Spitzer also detected water ice in the ejecta, consistent with surface water ice detected by Deep Impact&#x27;s spectrometer instrument. The water ice came from 1 meter below the surface crust (the devolatized layer around the nucleus).

===NEXT mission===
In part, because the crater formed during the &quot;Deep Impact&quot; collision could not be imaged during the initial flyby, on 3 July 2007, NASA approved the New Exploration of Tempel 1 (or NExT) mission. The low-cost mission utilized the already existing &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft, which had studied Comet Wild 2 in 2004. &quot;Stardust&quot; was placed into a new orbit so that it approached Tempel 1. It passed at a distance of approximately on February 15, 2011, 04:42 UTC. This was the first time that a comet was visited twice.

On February 15, NASA scientists identified the crater formed by &quot;Deep Impact&quot; in images from &quot;Stardust&quot;. The crater is estimated to be in diameter and has a bright mound in the center likely created when material from the impact fell back into the crater. Energy of impactor According to NASA &quot;The impactor delivers 19 Gigajoules (that&#x27;s 4.8 tons of TNT) of kinetic energy to excavate the crater. This kinetic energy is generated by the combination of the mass of the impactor (370 kg; 816 lbs) and its velocity when it impacts (~10.2 km/s)&quot;. According to NASA, &quot;The energy from the impact will excavate a crater approximately 100m wide and 28m deep&quot;.

The geometry of the flyby allowed investigators to obtain considerably more three-dimensional information about the nucleus from stereo pairs of images than during &quot;Deep Impact&quot;&#x27;s encounter. Scientists were able to quickly spot locations where an elevated flow-like formation of icy material on the comet&#x27;s surface receded due to sublimation between encounters.

==Close approaches==
Comets are in unstable orbits that evolve due to perturbations and outgassing. Tempel 1 passed within 0.04 AU – or 5.9 million km (3.7 million mi) – of the dwarf planet Ceres on November 11, 2011. Then, as a Jupiter-family comet, it will spend years interacting with the giant planet Jupiter, and by October 2084 perihelion will be lifted as high as 1.98 AU. Then perihelion will start dropping again and it will pass from Mars on October 17, 2183.

<text>Alice Lee Roosevelt Longworth (February 12, 1884 – February 20, 1980) was an American writer and socialite. She was the eldest child of U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt and his only child with his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt. Longworth led an unconventional and controversial life. Her marriage to Representative Nicholas Longworth III, a Republican Party leader and the 38th speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, was shaky, and her only child, Paulina, was from her affair with Senator William Borah.

==Childhood==
Alice Lee Roosevelt was born in the Roosevelt family home at 6 West 57th St. in Manhattan, New York on February 12, 1884. Her mother, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, was a Boston banking heiress. Her father, Theodore, was then a New York State Assemblyman. As an Oyster Bay Roosevelt, Alice was a descendant of the Schuyler family.

Two days after her birth, in the same house, her mother died of undiagnosed kidney failure. Eleven hours earlier that day, Theodore&#x27;s mother, Martha &quot;Mittie&quot; Bulloch Roosevelt, had died of typhoid fever.

Theodore was rendered so distraught by his wife&#x27;s death that he could not bear to think about her. He almost never spoke of her again, would not allow her to be mentioned in his presence, and even omitted her name from his autobiography. Therefore, his daughter Alice was called &quot;Baby Lee&quot; instead of by her first name. She continued this practice late in life, often preferring to be called &quot;Mrs. L&quot; rather than &quot;Alice&quot;.

Seeking solace, Theodore retreated from his life in New York and headed west, where he spent two years traveling and living on his ranch in North Dakota. He left his infant daughter in the care of his sister Anna, known as &quot;Bamie&quot; or &quot;Bye&quot;. Letters to Bamie reveal Theodore&#x27;s concern for his daughter. In one 1884 letter, he wrote, &quot;I hope Mousiekins will be very cunning, I shall dearly love her.&quot;

Bamie had a significant influence on young Alice, who would later speak of her admiringly: &quot;If auntie Bye had been a man, she would have been president&quot;. Bamie took her under her watchful care, moving Alice into her book-filled Manhattan house, until Theodore married again.

After Theodore married Edith Kermit Carow on December 2, 1886, Alice was raised by her father and stepmother. Through this marriage, Alice had five half-siblings: Theodore III (Ted), Kermit, Ethel, Archie, and Quentin. Theodore remained married to Edith until his death in 1919. During much of Alice&#x27;s childhood, Bamie was a remote figure who eventually married and moved to London for a time. As Alice later became more independent and came into conflict with her father and stepmother, Aunt &quot;Bye&quot; provided needed structure and stability. Late in life, she said of her aunt: &quot;There is always someone in every family who keeps it together. In ours, it was Auntie Bye.&quot;

== Relationship with stepmother ==

There were tensions in the relationship between young Alice and her stepmother Edith, who had known her husband&#x27;s previous wife and made it clear that she regarded her predecessor as a beautiful, but insipid, childlike fool. Edith once angrily told her that if Alice Hathaway Lee had lived, she would have bored Theodore to death.

Continuing tension with her stepmother and prolonged separation and limited attention from her father created a young woman who was impulsive, desperate for attention and confrontational. When her father was governor of New York, he and his wife proposed that Alice attend a conservative school for girls in New York City. In response, Alice wrote, &quot;If you send me I will humiliate you. I will do something that will shame you. I tell you I will.&quot;

In later years, Alice expressed admiration for her stepmother&#x27;s sense of humor and stated that they had shared similar literary tastes. In her autobiography &quot;Crowded Hours&quot;, Alice wrote of Edith Carow, &quot;That I was the child of another marriage was a simple fact and made a situation that had to be coped with, and Mother coped with it with a fairness and charm and intelligence which she has to a greater degree than almost any one else I know.&quot;

==Father&#x27;s presidency==

Following the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley in Buffalo, her father took office, an event that she greeted with &quot;sheer rapture&quot;. Alice became a celebrity and fashion icon at age 17, and at her social debut in 1902 she wore a gown of what became known as &quot;Alice blue&quot;, sparking a color trend in women&#x27;s clothing, and a popular song, &quot;Alice Blue Gown&quot;.

===Public conduct===
Alice was the center of attention in the social context of her father&#x27;s presidency, and she thrived on the attention, even as she chafed at some of the restrictions such attention placed on her. In this, Alice resembled her father. She later said of Theodore, &quot;He wants to be the bride at every wedding, the corpse at every funeral, and the baby at every christening.&quot; Her outspokenness and antics won the hearts of the American people, who nicknamed her &quot;Princess Alice&quot;.

Alice was known for breaking many social norms of her era. The &quot;Journal des débats&quot; in Paris noted that in 15 months Alice Roosevelt had attended 407 dinners, 350 balls, and 300 parties. One paper alleged that she had stripped down to her lingerie at a drunken orgy held at a Newport, Rhode Island mansion, and danced atop a table; a story that proved to be false. She smoked cigarettes in public, rode in cars with men, stayed out late partying, kept a pet snake named Emily Spinach (Emily after her spinster aunt and Spinach for its green color) in the White House, and was seen placing bets with a bookie.

On May 11, 1908, Alice amused herself in the Capitol&#x27;s gallery at the House of Representatives by placing a tack on the chair of an unknown but &quot;middle-aged&quot; and &quot;dignified&quot; gentleman. Upon encountering the tack, &quot;like the burst of a bubble on the fountain, like the bolt from the blue, like the ball from the cannon,&quot; the unfortunate fellow leapt up in pain and surprise while she looked away.
Once, a White House visitor commented on Alice&#x27;s frequent interruptions to the president&#x27;s office, often to offer political advice. The exhausted president commented to his friend, author Owen Wister, after she interrupted their conversation for the third time and he threatened to throw her &quot;out the window&quot;, &quot;I can either run the country or I can attend to Alice, but I cannot possibly do both.&quot;

===Tour of Asia===

In 1905, Alice, along with her father&#x27;s Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, led the American delegation to Japan, Hawaii, China, the Philippines, and Korea. It was the largest such diplomatic mission thus far, composed of 23 congressmen (including her future husband Nicholas Longworth), seven senators, diplomats, officials, and businessmen.

During the cruise to Japan, Alice jumped into the ship&#x27;s swimming pool fully clothed, and coaxed Congressman William Bourke Cockran to join her in the water after he commented that she looked to be having such fun swimming about, that he was tempted to jump in himself. &quot;Come along&quot; she replied and he jumped in. Putting a romantic spin on the story, newspapers reported it was Longworth to whom Alice was engaged. Years later, Robert F. Kennedy would chide her about the incident, saying it was outrageous for the time, to which the by-then-octogenarian Alice replied that it would only have been outrageous had she removed her clothes. In her autobiography, &quot;Crowded Hours&quot;, Alice made note of the event, pointing out that there was little difference between the linen skirt and blouse she had been wearing and a lady&#x27;s swimsuit of the period.

==Married life==

In December 1905, after returning to Washington from their diplomatic travels, the 21-year-old Alice became engaged to Nicholas Longworth III, a Republican U.S. House of Representatives member from Cincinnati, Ohio, who ultimately would rise to become speaker of the House. The two had traveled in the same social circles for several years, but their relationship solidified during the Imperial Cruise. A scion of a socially prominent Ohio family, Longworth was 14 years her senior and had a reputation as a Washington D.C. playboy.

Their wedding took place in February 1906 and was the social event of the season. It was attended by more than a thousand guests with many thousands gathered outside hoping for a glimpse of the bride. She wore a blue wedding dress and dramatically cut the wedding cake with a sword (borrowed from a military aide attending the reception). Immediately after the wedding, the couple left for a honeymoon that included a voyage to Cuba and a visit to the Longworths in Cincinnati. This was followed by travels to England and the continent which included having dinners with King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, Georges Clemenceau, Whitelaw Reid, Lord Curzon, and William Jennings Bryan. They bought a house at 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C., now the headquarters of the Washington Legal Foundation.

Alice publicly supported her father&#x27;s Bull Moose presidential candidacy in the 1912 presidential election, while her husband stayed loyal to his mentor, President William Howard Taft, and was running for re-election on the Republican ticket. Nicholas Longworth narrowly lost his House seat that year to Democratic challenger Stanley E. Bowdle.

During that election cycle, Alice appeared on stage with her father&#x27;s vice presidential candidate, Hiram Johnson, in Longworth&#x27;s own district. Longworth lost by 101 votes and she joked that she was worth at least 100 votes (meaning she was the reason he lost). However, Nicholas Longworth was elected again in 1914 and stayed in the House for the rest of his life. Alice&#x27;s campaign against her husband caused a permanent chill in their marriage.

During their marriage, Alice carried on numerous affairs. It was general knowledge in Washington that she had a long, ongoing affair with Senator William Borah. When Alice&#x27;s diaries were opened to historical research they indicated that Borah was the father of her daughter, Paulina Longworth (1925–1957).

Alice was renowned for her &quot;brilliantly malicious&quot; humor, even in this sensitive situation, since she had originally wanted to name her daughter &quot;Deborah,&quot; as in &quot;de Borah&quot;. And according to one family friend, &quot;everybody called her [Paulina] &#x27;Aurora Borah Alice.

==Post-Roosevelt presidency==
When it came time for the Roosevelt family to move out of the White House, Alice buried a Voodoo doll of the new first lady, Nellie Taft, in the front yard. Later, the Taft White House barred her from her former residence—the first but not the last administration to do so. During Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s administration (which barred her in 1916 for a bawdy joke at Wilson&#x27;s expense), Alice worked against the entry of the United States into the League of Nations.

During the Great Depression, when she, like many other Americans, found her fortunes reversed, Alice appeared in tobacco advertisements to earn money. She also published an autobiography, &quot;Crowded Hours&quot;. The book sold well and received rave reviews. &quot;Time&quot; praised its &quot;insouciant vitality&quot;.

Alice&#x27;s wit could have political effects on friend and foe alike. When columnist and cousin Joseph Wright Alsop V claimed that there was grass-roots support for Republican presidential nominee Wendell Willkie, who hoped to defeat Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, she said yes, &quot;the grass roots of 10,000 country clubs&quot;. During the 1940 presidential campaign, she publicly proclaimed that she&#x27;d &quot;rather vote for Hitler than vote for Franklin for a third term&quot;. Alice demolished Thomas Dewey, the 1944 opponent of her cousin Franklin, by comparing the pencil-mustached Republican to &quot;the bridegroom on the wedding cake&quot;. The image stuck and Governor Dewey lost two consecutive presidential elections.

Paulina Longworth married Alexander McCormick Sturm, with whom she had a daughter, Joanna (b. July 9, 1946). Alexander died in 1951. Paulina herself died in 1957 from an overdose of sleeping pills.

Not very long before Paulina&#x27;s death, she and Alice had discussed the care of Joanna in case of such an event. Alice fought for and won the custody of her granddaughter, whom she raised. In contrast to Alice&#x27;s relationship with her daughter, she doted on her granddaughter, and the two were very close. In an article in &quot;American Heritage&quot; in 1969, Joanna was described as a &quot;highly attractive and intellectual twenty-two-year-old&quot; and was called &quot;a notable contributor to Mrs. Longworth&#x27;s youthfulness... The bonds between them are twin cables of devotion and a healthy respect for each other&#x27;s tongue. &#x27;Mrs. L.,&#x27; says a friend, &#x27;has been a wonderful father and mother to Joanna: mostly father.

==Political connections==
From an early age, Alice was interested in politics. When advancing age and illness incapacitated her Aunt Bamie, Alice stepped into her place as an unofficial political adviser to her father. She warned her father against challenging the renomination of William Howard Taft in 1912.

Alice took a hard-line view of the Democrats and in her youth sympathized with the conservative wing of the Republican Party. She supported her half-brother Theodore Roosevelt Jr. when he ran for governor of New York in 1924. When Franklin D. Roosevelt ran for president in 1932, Alice publicly opposed his candidacy. Writing in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in October 1932, she said of FDR, &quot;Politically, his branch of the family and ours have always been in different camps, and the same surname is about all we have in common... I am a Republican... I am going to vote for Hoover... If I were not a Republican, I would still vote for Mr. Hoover this time.&quot;

Although Alice did not support John F. Kennedy in the 1960 election, she became very enamored of the Kennedy family and &quot;learned how amusing and attractive Democrats could be&quot;. She developed an affectionate, although sometimes strained, friendship with Robert F. Kennedy, perhaps because of his relatively thin skin. When Alice privately made fun of his scaling the newly named Mount Kennedy in Canada, he was not amused. She admitted to voting for President Lyndon Johnson over Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964 because she believed Goldwater was too mean.

Alice developed a genuine friendship with Richard Nixon when he was vice president. In 1957 he served as a pallbearer at Paulina&#x27;s funeral. When he returned to California after Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s second term and his loss in the 1960 presidential election, she kept in touch and did not consider his political career to be over. Alice encouraged Nixon to reenter politics and continued to invite him to her famous dinners. Nixon returned these favors by inviting her to his first formal White House dinner and to the 1971 wedding of his daughter Tricia Nixon.

==Later life==
In 1955, Alice slipped and suffered a broken hip. In 1956, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and though she successfully underwent a mastectomy at the time, cancer was found in her other breast in 1970, requiring a second mastectomy.

Alice was a lifelong member of the Republican Party, but her political sympathies began to change when she became close to the Kennedy family and Lyndon Johnson. She voted Democratic in 1964 and was known to be supporting Robert F. Kennedy in the 1968 Democratic primary.

After Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, Alice again supported her friend Richard Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 elections, just as she had done in his 1960 campaign against John F. Kennedy. She was recorded in a telephone conversation with Nixon in the Nixon White House tapes sharply criticizing the 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern. Nixon called her &quot;the most interesting [conversationalist of the age]&quot; and said, &quot;No one, no matter how famous, could ever outshine her.&quot;

She remained cordial with Nixon&#x27;s successor, Gerald Ford, but a perceived lack of social grace on the part of Jimmy Carter caused her to decline to ever meet him, the last sitting president in her lifetime. In the official statement marking her death, President Carter wrote &quot;She had style, she had grace, and she had a sense of humor that kept generations of political newcomers to Washington wondering which was worse—to be skewered by her wit or to be ignored by her.&quot;

Throughout her life Alice met 16 US Presidents: Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, William McKinley, her father, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. She is widely thought to be the person to meet more serving US Presidents than any other in history.

==Death==
After many years of ill health, Alice died in her Embassy Row house on February 20, 1980, eight days after her 96th birthday, of emphysema and pneumonia, with contributory effects of a number of other chronic illnesses. She is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C. She is the longest-lived child of a US President.

==Wit==
Of her quotable comments, Alice&#x27;s most famous found its way onto a pillow on her settee: &quot;If you can&#x27;t say something good about someone, sit right here by me.&quot; To Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had jokingly remarked at a party &quot;Here&#x27;s my blind date. I am going to call you Alice,&quot; she sarcastically said &quot;Senator McCarthy, you are not going to call me Alice. The truckman, the trashman and the policeman on my block may call me Alice, but you may not.&quot; She informed President Lyndon B. Johnson that she wore wide-brimmed hats so he couldn&#x27;t kiss her. When a well-known Washington senator was discovered to have been having an affair with a young woman less than half his age, she quipped, &quot;You can&#x27;t make a soufflé rise twice.&quot; She said in a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview with Eric Sevareid, televised on February 17, 1974, that she was a hedonist.

<doc id="583307" wikidata="Q7724388" url="?curid=583307" title="Saint Urho">
<text>Saint Urho ( ) is a fictional saint of Finland, created and elaborated by Finnish Americans in Northern Minnesota in the 1950s, to celebrate their heritage and extend celebrations of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day. His celebration day is set to March 16, the day before the March 17 feast day of Saint Patrick. Saint Patrick&#x27;s feast day is celebrated by Irish Americans, of whom there are also many in Minnesota.

== Creation ==
The legend of Saint Urho was the invention of a Finnish American named Richard Mattson, who worked at Ketola&#x27;s Department Store in Virginia, Minnesota in the spring of 1956. Mattson later recounted that he invented St. Urho when he was questioned by coworker Gene McCavic about the Finns&#x27; lack of a saint like the Irish St. Patrick, whose feat of casting the snakes out of Ireland is remembered on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. In fact, the patron saint of Finland (except for the Orthodox Church of Finland) is the bishop Saint Henry, whose feast day occurs on January 19.

According to the original &quot;Ode to St. Urho&quot; written by Gene McCavic and Richard Mattson, St. Urho was supposed to have cast &quot;tose &#x27;Rogs&quot; (those frogs) out of Finland by the power of his loud voice, which he obtained by drinking &quot;feelia sour&quot; (sour whole milk) and eating &quot;kala mojakka&quot; (fish soup). The selection of the name Urho as the saint&#x27;s name was probably influenced by the accession of Urho Kekkonen to the presidency of Finland in 1956. (Similarly, St. Urho&#x27;s Pub in Töölö, Helsinki, is known to have received its name from Urho Kekkonen and has nothing to do with Saint Urho). &quot;Urho&quot; in the Finnish language also has the meaning of &quot;hero&quot; or simply &quot;brave&quot;.

The original &quot;Ode to St. Urho&quot; identified St. Urho&#x27;s Day as taking place on May 24. Later the date was changed to March 16, the day before St. Patrick&#x27;s Day so the Finns could start drinking green beer a day before the Irish. St. Urho&#x27;s feast is supposed to be celebrated by wearing the colors Royal Purple and Nile Green. Other details of the invented legend also changed, apparently under the influence of Dr. Sulo Havumäki, a psychology professor at Bemidji State University in Bemidji, Minnesota. The legend now states that St. Urho drove away grasshoppers (rather than frogs) from Finland using the incantation &quot;Heinäsirkka, heinäsirkka, mene täältä helveteen!&quot; (&quot;Grasshopper, grasshopper, go from hence to Hell!&quot;), thus saving the Finnish grape crops.
Another version of the modern celebration of St. Urho&#x27;s Day is that it was created by Kenneth Brist of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Brist, a high school teacher, was teaching in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early to mid-1950s in an area largely populated by people of Finnish heritage. He and his friends concocted March 16 as St. Urho&#x27;s Day so that they had two days to celebrate, the next day being St. Patrick&#x27;s Day.

==Ode to Saint Urho==

==Popularity==
Brist promoted the &quot;annual cancellation&quot; of the St. Urho&#x27;s Day Parade in Chippewa Falls with advertisements in the Chippewa Herald Telegram and by teaching his high school students about the legend of St. Urho.
The &quot;Ode to St. Urho&quot; has been modified to reflect these changes in the feast day and legend. The Ode is written in a self-parodying form of English as spoken by Finnish immigrants. There is also a &quot;Ballad of St. Urho&quot; written by Sally Karttunen.

There are St. Urho fan clubs in Canada and Finland as well as the U.S., and the festival is celebrated on March 16 in many American and Canadian communities with Finnish roots. The original statue of St. Urho is located in Menahga, Minnesota. Another interesting chainsaw-carved St. Urho statue is located in Finland, Minnesota. A 2001 book, &quot;The Legend of St. Urho&quot; by Joanne Asala, presents much of the folklore surrounding St. Urho and includes an essay by Richard Mattson on the &quot;birth&quot; of St. Urho.

On March 16, 1999 in Kaleva, Michigan a large Metal Sculpture of a Grasshopper was dedicated in honor of St. Urho&#x27;s day. Kaleva is a community settled by Finnish immigrants in 1900. Kaleva is named after the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, the Epic Finnish story about the Creation of the Earth.

Many places with mixed populations of Finnish and Irish have an annual St. Urho&#x27;s day event on the night before St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. Butte, Montana holds such a celebration each March 16.

Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, just northeast of Minnesota, is another location where St. Urho&#x27;s Day is joyfully celebrated on the weekend nearest to March 16. The Finlandia Club is the headquarters for all that is Finnish in northern Ontario. A grasshopper slung on a pole is hauled through the streets in a parade through the streets near the Finlandia club where the celebration continues with food, music and dance.

Although St. Urho&#x27;s Day is not widely known or celebrated in Finland, it has been celebrated in Turku since 1987. At the University of Turku students studying Folkloristics, Comparative Religion and Ethnology have organized a St. Urho&#x27;s Day play yearly since 1987.

<text>Dennis Frank Wise (born 16 December 1966) is an English former professional football player and manager who played as a central midfielder. He spent the majority of his career at Chelsea, from 1990 to 2001.

Beginning his career at Wimbledon, Wise came to prominence as a member of the &quot;Crazy Gang&quot;, and in 1988, was part of the team that won the FA Cup in an upset victory over Liverpool. In 1990, he joined Chelsea, becoming captain three years later under the stewardship of Glenn Hoddle. During his time at Stamford Bridge, Wise won two FA Cups, a League Cup and a UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, and is the club&#x27;s second most successful captain, behind John Terry. Wise was a popular figure amongst the Chelsea support, and was named the club&#x27;s Player of the Year on two occasions. In June 2001, he was sold to Leicester City.

Internationally, Wise was in and out of the squad for the England national football team, with the majority of his appearances coming in 2000, when Kevin Keegan was manager. He was named in the UEFA Euro 2000 squad, playing in all three of England&#x27;s group games. His only goal for the national side was on his debut on 1 May 1991, against Turkey.

In the latter years of his playing career, Wise gradually became involved in the managerial aspects of the game, starting at Millwall, where he took on the role of player-manager, taking them to the FA Cup Final and European football for the first time ever. He was briefly caretaker manager at Southampton, following the departure of Harry Redknapp, before he took over the reins at Swindon Town on a permanent basis. In October 2006, he was appointed manager of the then-Championship side Leeds United, who found themselves in the relegation zone. Although they were ultimately relegated, Wise reshaped his side in the close season and Leeds made an excellent start to their first season in the third tier of English football.

In a surprise career move, despite their strong position and likelihood of promotion, Wise left Leeds in January 2008 to join the newly reshaped management team at Newcastle United in an executive role, tasked with travelling around Europe and further afield identifying young players and developing the academy. Wise left Newcastle on 1 April 2009. Following the situation that led to his departure, Wise admitted that &quot;it has all had a damaging effect on my career&quot;. He has since worked as a pundit for Sky Sports. In 2017, Wise appeared on the seventeenth series of I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.

==Playing career==

===Wimbledon===
Wise started his career as an apprentice with Southampton, but was left without a club after he fell out with manager Lawrie McMenemy. He moved to Wimbledon on 28 March 1985 at the age of 18 on a free transfer and made his debut under manager Dave Bassett. During the autumn of 1985, Wise was loaned to Swedish non-league club Grebbestads IF. He returned to Plough Lane following his loan spell and helped the club gain promotion to the Football League First Division in 1986. In his first season in the First Division, Wise scored four goals in 27 starts as the club defied the critics and finished the season in sixth place.

He was a member of the infamous Wimbledon &quot;Crazy Gang&quot; that reached the 1988 FA Cup Final. On 12 March 1988, he provided the free-kick from which Brian Gayle headed in the clinching goal against Watford to secure passage to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. In Wimbledon&#x27;s semi-final match against Luton Town on 9 April, he scored the winner as they reached the final with a 2–1 victory. In the final on 14 May, he played an influential role in defeating heavy favourites Liverpool at Wembley, containing winger John Barnes and supplying the cross from a free kick from which Lawrie Sanchez headed home the winning goal. Wimbledon were unable to compete in the 1988–89 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, due to the ongoing ban on English teams from European competitions, following the actions of a group of Liverpool supporters in the 1985 European Cup Final Heysel disaster.

===Chelsea===
Wise signed for Chelsea on 3 July 1990 for a then-club record fee of £1.6 million. In his first season with the club, he scored 13 goals in 44 matches as Chelsea finished in 11th place. Wise&#x27;s former Wimbledon teammate Vinnie Jones joined Chelsea prior to the 1991–92 season, and the intimidating presence of his fellow Londoner in the middle of the park seemed to help him rediscover his best form. Wise was Chelsea&#x27;s top scorer for the season with 14 goals from midfield, with perhaps his best performance coming in a 2–1 victory away to Liverpool on 1 February 1992; Chelsea&#x27;s first league win at Anfield since 1935.

Following the departure of captain Andy Townsend in 1993, and the arrival of Glenn Hoddle as manager, Wise&#x27;s growing stature within the side was recognised, with Hoddle installing him as captain. Though league form was disappointing throughout the 1993–94 season, with the Blues finishing 14th, Wise led Chelsea to their first FA Cup Final in 24 years, though he couldn&#x27;t prevent the Blues crashing to a 4–0 defeat to Manchester United.

In the second league match of the 1994–95 season, Wise scored his first goal, netting a penalty as the Blues came from 0–2 down to defeat Leeds United 3–2 on 27 August 1994. Wise&#x27;s ill-discipline began to show at the beginning of the 1994–95 season, picking up a red card for swearing in a 2–4 loss to Newcastle United on 10 September. He scored his first goal in Europe five days later, capping off an impressive Chelsea performance as the Blues defeated Viktoria Žižkov 4–2 in the first round of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. Worse was to follow off the pitch as Wise was sentenced to a three-month prison term in March 1995 for assaulting a London taxi-driver and was ordered to pay £965 compensation to him for damage to the cab, £169 for damage to his spectacles and £100 for the shock and distress. The prison sentence was later overturned on appeal. Nonetheless he was briefly stripped of the Chelsea captaincy by Hoddle over the affair, and a long term thigh injury capped a miserable season for the midfielder.

Wise captained the Chelsea team that defeated Middlesbrough 2–0 in the 1997 FA Cup Final, only the club&#x27;s second FA Cup triumph and Wise&#x27;s first trophy as Chelsea captain. Chelsea&#x27;s success would continue in the 1997–98 season as Wise first led Chelsea to victory in the League Cup, another 2–0 win against Middlesbrough, the midfielder&#x27;s cross for Frank Sinclair&#x27;s opener capping a superb display. Wise also made a decisive contribution in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, a dinked pass over the Stuttgart defence setting up Gianfranco Zola to score the winner, moments after coming on as a substitute.

Wise then captained Chelsea to victory over Real Madrid in the 1998 UEFA Super Cup, a late Gus Poyet strike securing a 1–0 victory in Monaco. His disciplinary issues were so severe during the 1998–99 season, that Wise missed no fewer than 15 matches in all competitions. He received three red cards in addition to being charged with biting the arm of Real Mallorca defender Elena Marcelino in the second half of their Cup Winners&#x27; Cup semi-final first-leg 1–1 draw at Stamford Bridge, though he was later cleared by UEFA. In the Premier League, he led Chelsea to their highest ever final position at the time, third, thereby securing a place in the Champions League for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, losing only three leagues games along the way, a feat bettered by only three English champions in the 20th century.

In Chelsea&#x27;s first ever Champions League match, a third-qualifying round match against Latvian side Skonto FC, Wise captained the side to a 3–0 victory, and 0–0 draw in the second leg meant that Chelsea had qualified for the group stage of the Champions League at the first time of asking. On 20 October 1999, he came on as a second-half substitute and scored Chelsea&#x27;s fourth goal as they defeated Galatasaray 5–0 in Istanbul in their fourth Champions League group match. He scored a memorable Champions League equaliser in the San Siro against A.C. Milan a week later to secure top spot in the group. In February 2000 his disciplinary problems resurfaced as he was charged with misconduct by the FA following an alleged confrontation with Kenny Cunningham in the tunnel after the 3–1 victory over former club Wimbledon at Stamford Bridge, and was later fined £7,500. Wise captained Chelsea to their second FA Cup win in three years, being awarded the Man of the Match honour as the Blues defeated Aston Villa 1–0 courtesy of a Roberto Di Matteo goal on 20 May 2000. Wise&#x27;s last major trophy as captain of Chelsea would come in the 2000 FA Charity Shield on 13 August, as goals from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mario Melchiot secured a 2–0 win over reigning league champions Manchester United.

With new manager Claudio Ranieri seeking to lower the average age of the Chelsea squad, he was sold to Leicester City on 25 June 2001 for £1.6 million. His time at Stamford Bridge would span 11 years, from 1990 to 2001 and when he finally left Chelsea, the combative midfielder finished with the fourth most appearances in the club&#x27;s history, featuring 445 times and scoring 76 goals.

===Leicester City===
Wise&#x27;s time at Leicester was less successful and marred by controversy. He made just 17 league appearances, scoring once against Liverpool, and was sent home from a pre-season tour of Finland and suspended by the club on 20 July 2002 after breaking the nose and jaw of teammate Callum Davidson in an argument.

Wise was sacked by the club for serious misconduct on 2 August, after which Leicester went into administration. Surprised by the dismissal, he contacted the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association and appealed against the decision. The Football League Disciplinary Commission later ruled that Wise had been harshly treated by Leicester and ordered that he be reinstated and given the maximum punishment of two weeks&#x27; wages (about £70,000). The tribunal&#x27;s order led the club to launch an appeal against the decision, which they won on 18 September.

===Millwall===
Wise then signed for Millwall on 24 September 2002 and became player-manager in 2003. Millwall were the first team from outside the top flight to reach the FA Cup final since Sunderland in 1992 when Wise led them to their first ever FA Cup Final in 2004. The First Division side lost to Manchester United 3–0. Despite losing, Millwall qualified for a place in the UEFA Cup for the first time in their history, as United had already qualified for the Champions League. They were knocked out in the first round by Hungarian champions Ferencváros. He resigned at the end of the 2004–05 season. Wise decided to leave as a new regime entered the club.

===Southampton===
Wise returned to Southampton on a free transfer on 27 June 2005 and made 12 appearances for the club. With the resignation of Harry Redknapp, he was briefly joint-caretaker manager of the club with Dave Bassett. However, he left St Mary&#x27;s on 26 December, when George Burley was appointed as the new manager. He scored once in the league for Southampton, in a 2–2 draw with Ipswich Town.

===Coventry City===
It was not long before Wise was playing again, as he signed a six-month deal with Coventry City on 19 January 2006. He joined up once again with Micky Adams, who had been his manager whilst he was at Leicester. He made an emphatic start, beginning his spell with Coventry by scoring a goal in each of his first three games with the club, including a spectacular overhead kick from the edge of the penalty area against Hull City. On 9 May, out-of-contract Wise was offered a new one-year contract at the Ricoh Arena but decided it was time to hang up the boots and go back into management. He finished his Coventry career having scored six goals in thirteen appearances.

==International career==
Wise made his England debut on 1 May 1991 and scored the game&#x27;s only goal as England defeated Turkey in a Euro 92 qualifying match at the İzmir Atatürk Stadium. Following a good season, Wise was expected to be included in the final squad for the 1996 European Championships held in England but just missed out on a place in Terry Venables&#x27; squad. Despite leading Chelsea to victories in the 1998 Football League Cup Final and the 1998 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final, Wise was passed over by former Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle for a place in the England squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

He earned a recall to the England team in 1999, after four years away from the national setup, playing in the match against Belgium. He followed this up with an impressive performance against Argentina on 23 February 2000, as the sides drew 0–0 at Wembley.

He featured in three of the four friendly matches for England in the build-up to the Euro 2000 tournament in the Netherlands and Belgium and was subsequently included in the final squad by manager Kevin Keegan. He came on as a second-half substitute for Steve McManaman in England&#x27;s first match on 12 June 2000, his first competitive international in almost nine years, but England threw away a 2–0 lead and were defeated 2–3 by Portugal. He started England&#x27;s next match against Germany and was praised for his part in the 1–0 win, England&#x27;s first over Germany in a major tournament since the final of the 1966 World Cup. He started England&#x27;s final group game against Romania as well, but was replaced by Nick Barmby at half-time as the Three Lions fell 2–3 to a late Ionel Ganea penalty kick and were eliminated.

Following Euro 2000, Wise played the full ninety minutes against winners France at the Stade de France in Paris on 2 September as the sides drew 1–1. His final cap for England came in a 0–0 World Cup qualifying match against Finland on 11 October 2000.

==Managerial career==

===Swindon Town===
On 22 May 2006, Wise was appointed Swindon Town player-manager on a three-year contract, with ex-Chelsea teammate Gustavo Poyet as his assistant. He made an excellent start to the season by winning six out of seven games and topping the League Two table with 18 points after a 2–0 away win against Chester City on 1 September. As a result of this tremendous start, Wise was awarded the Manager of the Month award.

On 24 October, Wise left Swindon to join Leeds United, leaving the club third in the league, with thirty-one points from fifteen games.

===Leeds United===
On 20 September 2006, Wise was linked with the vacant Leeds United managerial post, following the sacking of Kevin Blackwell. On 21 October, Swindon gave Wise, and his assistant Gus Poyet, permission to speak to Leeds, following their request. However, talks broke down between the clubs when they were unable to agree a suitable financial package and on 23 October, Swindon withdrew permission for Leeds to talk with, or seek to appoint, Wise and Poyet, stating that &quot;Dennis and Gus remain valued members of Swindon Town FC as both players and part of the management team&quot;. In a bid to keep hold of the pair, the club offered them both significantly improved terms. Later that day, Swindon confirmed that they had reached a suitable financial settlement package with Leeds for the services of Dennis Wise and Gus Poyet and that they looked set to join. Following the successful negotiation of acceptable compensation in line with the expectations of Swindon Town, on 24 October, the boards of both clubs officially confirmed that Dennis Wise, Gus Poyet and Andrew Beasley had joined Leeds United as manager, assistant manager and goalkeeping coach respectively.

On the evening of his arrival, Wise watched from the stands at Elland Road as he saw his new side crash to a 3–1 defeat in the League Cup against fellow Championship side Southend United. He received a standing ovation from fans and in a press conference unveiling him to the media, he said that he believed that it did not matter that he formerly played for Chelsea. In the interview he stated that his aim was to bring Leeds back into the Premiership. Wise took over with the club second from bottom of the Championship and in a difficult financial position.

Wise&#x27;s first game in charge came four days later, ironically against Southend at Elland Road again, though this time it was a league fixture and Leeds won the game 2–0. However, they continued to struggle for the remainder of the season under Wise and relegation was confirmed on 4 May 2007 with only one game remaining, when the Football League gave the club a 10-point penalty for going into administration. Leeds finished bottom of the league and they were relegated to League One for the first time in their history. Nonetheless, chairman Ken Bates retained Wise for the 2007–08 season.

On 4 August, Leeds were granted their golden share, but they were given another penalty, this time 15 points, after administrators KPMG refused to resurrect the CVA for the &#x27;old&#x27; Leeds United company. Despite this, they made an excellent start, winning their first 7 league games and Wise was named as manager of the month for both August and September. However, on 29 October 2007, Poyet left Leeds to become Juande Ramos&#x27;s assistant at Tottenham. Three days later, Wise&#x27;s ex-manager at Wimbledon, Dave Bassett, became his number two. The partnership did not start well and Leeds finally lost their unbeaten record, losing 3–1 to Carlisle United at Brunton Park on 3 November.

Leeds briefly topped the table on Boxing Day, after drawing 1–1 in an early kick-off against Hartlepool United at the Victoria Ground, and they went into 2008 third in the league. Wise left the club on 28 January 2008 in a surprise move to take up a role at Newcastle United, his last game in charge being a 1–1 draw against Luton Town at Kenilworth Road on 26 January.

==Executive roles==

=== Newcastle United ===
On 29 January 2008, Newcastle United announced that Wise would be joining the club as Executive Director (Football), an advisor to the board on footballing matters, reporting directly to the club chairman Chris Mort. Although speculated to be in the role of Director of Football or General Manager, the job is thought to be more restricted, involving transfers, scouting and youth development, alongside simultaneous appointment of Tony Jimenez as Vice-President (Player Recruitment) and Jeff Vetere as Technical Co-ordinator, following the earlier shock return of first team manager Kevin Keegan. Keegan had previously expressed disquiet with the concept of a Director of Football, both in commenting about the previous Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce, and latterly the proposition of Newcastle owner Mike Ashley appointing one during his tenure at the club.

Wise&#x27;s role, as stated by Ashley, was to be a &#x27;&quot;football-related&quot; executive director&#x27;. In a February 2008 interview, Mort revealed that Newcastle had &quot;heard on the grapevine&quot; that Wise was considering a &quot;move upstairs&quot;. Wise was selected as his relative youth and being a &quot;bundle of energy&quot; suited the new role that would involve &quot;travelling around Europe and further afield&quot;. Wise, with Vetere, was tasked with helping identify young players for approval by first team manager Kevin Keegan. Wise&#x27;s role would also entail him helping develop the academy.

The departure of Keegan from the club, on 4 September, saw Wise, Jimenez (who left the club on 9 October) and club owner Ashley come under mounting pressure from the club&#x27;s supporters to quit. Wise left Newcastle on 1 April 2009.

=== Como 1907 ===
On 9 May 2019, the Northern Italian team Como 1907 entrusted him with the role of technical consultant on behalf of SENT Entertainment, the consortium that had taken over the Larian company a few months earlier. In February 2021 he rose to the role of sole administrator, replacing Michael Gandler.

<text>Al-Mu’tassimu Billahi Muhibbuddin Sultan Abdul Halim Mu&#x27;adzam Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah (Jawi: ; 28 November 1927 – 11 September 2017) was the 28th Sultan of Kedah from 1958 until his death in 2017, and served twice as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong from 1970 to 1975 and from 2011 to 2016. He was the first and only ruler to reign as Yang di-Pertuan Agong twice, as well as the oldest elected to the office. Prior to his death, he was the second longest-reigning living monarch in the world after Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Born at Istana Anak Bukit near Alor Setar as Tunku Abdul Halim ibni Tunku Badlishah, he was the second, but eldest surviving son, of Sultan Badlishah (1894–1958; reigned 1943–1958), who later became the 28th Sultan of Kedah. Of Malay and Thai descent, his mother Tunku Sofiah binti Tunku Mahmud (born 29 April 1899), was a Kedah-born princess who died in an automobile accident on 28 February 1934. Abdul Halim&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Tunku Mahmud, was once &quot;Raja Muda&quot; (heir presumptive) to the throne of Kedah.

He was educated at Alor Merah and Titi Gajah Malay schools and Sultan Abdul Hamid College in Alor Star between 1946 and 1948. He went on to Wadham College, Oxford and obtained a Diploma in Social Science and Public Administration. He subsequently joined the Kedah Administrative Service, serving in the Alor Star district office and later, the state treasury.

==Reign as Sultan of Kedah==

On 6 August 1949, Abdul Halim was appointed &quot;Raja Muda&quot; or heir apparent, and acceded as the 28th Sultan of Kedah upon his father&#x27;s death on 14 July 1958. He was installed at the Balai Besar, Kota Star Palace in Alor Star on 20 February 1959, in a ceremony not held since 1710.

===Silver jubilee celebrations===
Abdul Halim celebrated his silver jubilee on 15 July 1983 with his royal consort, Sultanah Bahiyah. To commemorate the occasion the Kedah government opened Jubli Perak Park at Sungai Petani, Kedah&#x27;s second largest town.

===Golden jubilee celebrations===
On 15 July 2008, Abdul Halim celebrated his golden jubilee as the Sultan of Kedah. He was the 4th Sultan of Kedah in a line of 28 to reign for at least 50 years.

In conjunction with the golden jubilee, 15 July 2008 was declared a public holiday for the state of Kedah. A ceremony of handing over the contributions in conjunction with the golden jubilee was held at the Istana Anak Bukit on 6 July 2008 by Kedah Chief Minister Azizan Abdul Razak. Throughout the week of the golden jubilee, various events were held to commemorate the Sultan.

==Reign as the Yang-di Pertuan Agong==

===First election as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong===
Abdul Halim served as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong from 21 September 1965 to 20 September 1970.

===First election as Yang di-Pertuan Agong===

In July 1970, Abdul Halim was elected as the 5th Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia and served from 21 September 1970 until 20 September 1975. He was the third youngest monarch to ascend the throne of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong after Putra of Perlis and Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu.

During his kingship, Abdul Halim presided over the first transfer of power of the civilian government when his uncle, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman resigned in favour of his deputy Tun Abdul Razak. Tunku Abdul Rahman had felt that he should not serve under his nephew, given strict Malay royal protocol, but agreed to stay on as prime minister for one day of Abdul Halim&#x27;s reign.

===Second election as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong===
On 2 November 2006, Abdul Halim was elected for the second time to serve a five-year term as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong. He was the first person to have been elected to this office twice.

===Second election as Yang di-Pertuan Agong===
In October 2011, Abdul Halim was elected to a second term as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, which commenced on 13 December 2011. He was the first and only person to hold the position twice. He was also the oldest Malay Ruler to be installed as Yang di-Pertuan Agong at 84 years and 15 days old, surpassing the previous record holder, Salahuddin of Selangor, who was installed at 73 years and 49 days old. He was installed on 11 April 2012 at the Istana Negara.

During his tenure as Yang Di Pertuan Agong, a Council of Regency consisting of his brothers Tunku Annuar (d. May 2014), Tunku Sallehuddin, Tunku Abdul Hamid Thani, and daughter Tunku Puteri Intan Safinaz was assigned to discharge Abdul Halim&#x27;s duties as Sultan of Kedah. His tenure as Yang Di Pertuan Agong ended on 12 December 2016.

==Family life==
Abdul Halim had two wives:

1. Sultanah Bahiyah, the daughter of Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan, married in 1956. She served as Sultanah of Kedah (1958–2003) and Raja Permaisuri Agong (1970–1975). She died on 26 August 2003 at the Istana Kuala Cegar in Alor Star. They had one daughter:
* Her Highness (Yang Teramat Mulia) Brigadier General Dato&#x27; Seri Diraja Tan Sri Tunku Puteri Intan Safinaz, the Tunku Temenggong of Kedah &quot;(previously the Tunku Panglima Besar of Kedah)&quot; (born 22 July 1966).

On 3 May 1960, they also adopted the twin daughters of his eldest sister, Tunku Hamidah, before the birth of their only child:

<doc id="583314" wikidata="Q317381" url="?curid=583314" title="Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan">
<text>Tuanku [[Sir]] Abdul Rahman ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhammad (Jawi: ; 24 August 1895 – 1 April 1960) was the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan from 1933, and the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of the Federation of Malaya from 1957, until his death in 1960.

==Early career==

Born at Seri Menanti on August 24, 1895, he was the second son of Tuanku Muhammad ibni Tuanku Antah, first Yang di-Pertuan Besar of modern Negeri Sembilan and seventh Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Seri Menanti (1888–1933) by his second wife, Tunku Puan Chik.

He received his primary education at the Jempol Malay School, going on to the Malay College between 1907 and 1914. He worked at the Federal Secretariat in Kuala Lumpur for a period of one year before being appointed Assistant Collector of Land Revenue in Seremban. He served in the Malayan Volunteer Infantry as a second lieutenant, and was promoted lieutenant in 1918.

On the death of his elder brother, Tunku Abdul Aziz, in 1917, he was groomed as heir to the throne and received the title of Tunku Muda Serting.

He was later appointed as Assistant Malay Officer in Klang before being transferred to Sepang. He was then assigned to work in Ulu Selangor as Assistant Collector of Land Revenue. As a result of his perseverance and diligence, he was promoted to Assistant District Officer. The turning point of his career was in 1925, when he served for a short period in the Kuala Lumpur Supreme Court.

In 1925, he accompanied his father, who was then the ruler of Negeri Sembilan, on a trip to the United Kingdom for the British Empire Exhibition in Wembley and to visit King George V. During the journey to the United Kingdom, he decided he wanted to study law. With the approval of his father Tuanku Muhammad, he stayed in the United Kingdom until he completed his studies and received a degree in law.

He stayed on to qualify as a barrister from Inner Temple. Three years later, in 1928, he was admitted to the bar. In London, he was elected first President of the Kesatuan Melayu United Kingdom, one of the earliest Malay nationalist groups.

Upon returning to Malaya in December 1928, he served in the Malayan Civil Service in various parts of the country. For the first few years, he worked hard until he became a Magistrate. Subsequently, he was appointed District Officer.

==Election as Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan==
In 1933, following the death of his father, he succeeded him onto the throne of Negeri Sembilan. At that time, he was already an advocate, hence making him the only Malay ruler with an advocate and solicitor&#x27;s qualifications.

Abdul Rahman (as he became) admitted to British interrogators that he had made speeches in favour of the Japanese during the latter&#x27;s military occupation of Malaya (1942–1945) but this had been done under duress and that the Japanese forcibly removed certain of his royal privileges.

Although he subsequently signed the Malayan Union treaty, he repudiated it later and upon the suggestion of Sultan Badlishah of Kedah, engaged a London-based lawyer to represent the case of the Malay rulers against the Malayan Union plan of Clement Attlee&#x27;s government.

==Election as Yang di-Pertuan Agong==
Abdul Rahman was elected first Yang di-Pertuan Agong or Paramount Ruler of independent Malaya on 31 August 1957 for a five-year term by eight votes to one, defeating the more senior Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang.

He had been the ruler of Negeri Sembilan for 24 years before being elected as the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

==Installation==
Abdul Rahman was installed as the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya on 2 September 1957 at the throne room of the Istana Negara.

As Malay rulers do not traditionally possess crowns, he was installed by kissing the royal kris of state &quot;(keris kerajaan)&quot; to the beat of the nobat, a tradition which has been followed by every Yang di-Pertuan Agong since.

In honour of Abdul Rahman, all subsequent Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia have also used the headdress with &quot;Dendam Tak Sudah&quot; (literally Unending Revenge) style, the fashion employed in Negeri Sembilan.

==Death and funeral==
Abdul Rahman died in his sleep at the Istana Negara in Kuala Lumpur in the early morning of 1 April 1960. The lying in state was held at the Banquet Hall of the Istana Negara. On 2 April 1960, a state funeral procession was held in Kuala Lumpur, whereupon Abdul Rahman&#x27;s teak coffin was then taken by train to Seremban and later by hearse to the Istana Besar, Seri Menanti. He was buried at the Royal Mausoleum in Seri Menanti, Negeri Sembilan on 5 April 1960.

==Legacy==
Abdul Rahman&#x27;s portrait has been featured on the obverse of Malaysian Ringgit banknotes since the first series was issued in 1967.

Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman (; &quot;abbr.&quot; STAR) is a premier, all-boys fully residential school in Malaysia funded by the Government of Malaysia and is named after Abdul Rahman. It is located in Ipoh, Perak and was built in 1957.

==Belief in democracy==
Abdul Rahman believed strongly in parliamentary democracy and one of his most memorable quotes was to a foreign dignitary from the Middle East who in 1959 complained about Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj&#x27;s &quot;high handed&quot; manner and wanted the King to sack him. To which he replied: &quot;Alas I can&#x27;t sack him; he is elected by the people, and as Prime Minister of the country he can sack me!&quot;

==Family life==

Abdul Rahman married four times. His marriages were to:
# in 1919 to Dulcie Campbell, a Eurasian nurse who embraced Islam and took the name Cik Maimunah (divorced)
# in 1920 to Tunku Maharun binti Tunku Mambang, a member of the Negeri Sembilan royal family (divorced)
# in 1929 to Tunku Kurshiah binti Tunku Besar Burhanuddin, a cousin, who became first Raja Permaisuri Agong or Queen of Malaya 
# in 1948 to Tunku Zaidah binti Tunku Zakaria, another cousin.

Abdul Rahman fathered three sons and five daughters. His second wife, Tuanku Maharum gave birth to his firstborn son, Tuanku Munawir. Cik Engku Maimunah, his first wife, gave birth to two sons and two daughters. The eldest is Tunku Aida, followed by Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar, Tunku Sheilah and Tunku Abdullah. Tunku Kursiah, his third wife, gave birth to two daughters. His fourth wife, Tunku Zaidah, gave birth to his youngest child, a daughter.

Two of his sons succeeded him as Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan:
# Tuanku Munawir (son of Tunku Maharun), who reigned from 1960 to 1967 as the ninth Yang di-Pertuan Besar.
# Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar (son of Dulcie Campbell), who succeeded his brother in 1967, as the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Besar, and reigned till 27 December 2008. He served as the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong from 1994 to 1999.

His grandson, Tuanku Muhriz, currently reigns as the eleventh Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan.

His daughter, Sultanah Bahiyah, from his third marriage to Tunku Kurshiah served as Sultanah of Kedah upon the accession of her husband, Sultan Abdul Halim, in 1958 until her death in 2003. She also served as the fifth Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaysia from 1970 to 1975.

<doc id="583320" wikidata="Q4263399" url="?curid=583320" title="Joseph Force Crater">
<text>Joseph Force Crater&lt;ref name=&quot;flashbak/PA-8536330&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (January 5, 1889 – disappeared August 6, 1930; declared legally dead June 6, 1939) was an American lawyer who served as a New York State Supreme Court Justice and mysteriously vanished shortly after the state began an investigation into corruption in New York City. Despite massive publicity, the missing persons case was never solved and was officially closed forty years after Crater was declared dead.

==Early life and education==
Joseph Crater was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, the eldest of four children of the former Leila Virginia Montague and Frank Ellsworth Crater, a produce market operator and orchard owner. Both parents had immigrated from Ireland. Crater was educated at Lafayette College (class of 1910) and Columbia University, where he was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. During his time at Columbia, he met Stella Mance Wheeler,&lt;ref name=&quot;flashbak/john-crater-august-6-1930&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who was at the time married, and helped her get a divorce. They married seven days after her divorce was finalized, in spring 1917.

==Career==
Crater opened an office at the Equitable Building in Manhattan, joined Tammany Hall district leader Martin J. Healy″s Cayuga Democratic Club, and spent time organizing election workers and representing the club in election law cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypress/missingest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months before his disappearance, on April 8, 1930, Franklin D. Roosevelt, then New York governor, appointed Crater as Justice of the New York Supreme Court for New York County, which is a trial court, despite the designation &quot;supreme&quot; (New York State&#x27;s highest court is the Court of Appeals). He issued two published opinions: &quot;Rotkowitz v. Sohn&quot;, February 8, 1930 involving fraudulent conveyances and mortgage foreclosure fraud; and &quot;Henderson v. Park Central Motors Service&quot;, July 11, 1930 dealing with a garage company&#x27;s liability for an expensive car stolen and wrecked by an ex-convict.

Attention was later drawn to Crater&#x27;s liquidating investments worth $16,000 and withdrawing $7,000 from his bank account that spring (together equivalent to about US $ in ), which was possibly used as a pay-off for his judgeship. He had also given the congratulatory speech at the dinner celebrating George Ewald&#x27;s judgeship in 1927; accusations of Tammany Hall corruption in that appointment were an initial impetus in the opening of what would become the Seabury Commission in mid-1930.

==Disappearance==
Crater and his wife were vacationing at their summer cabin in Belgrade, Maine, in the summer of 1930, shortly after the anti-corruption inquiry began. In late July, Crater received a telephone call. He told his wife nothing about the call other than to say that he had to return to New York City &quot;to straighten those fellows out&quot;. The next day, he arrived at his apartment at 40 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village, but instead of dealing with business, he went to Atlantic City, New Jersey, with showgirl Sally Lou Ritz.

Crater returned to Maine on August 1, then traveled back to New York City on August 3, promising his wife that he would return by her birthday on August 9. She stated that he was in good spirits and behaving normally when he left. On the morning of August 6, Crater spent two hours going through his files in his chambers, reportedly destroying several documents. He then had law clerk Joseph Mara cash two checks for him that amounted to US $5,150 (equivalent to about $ in ). At noon, Crater and Mara carried two locked briefcases to Crater&#x27;s apartment, where Crater told Mara to take the rest of the day off.

That evening, Crater went to a Broadway ticket agency run by friend Joseph Gransky and reserved one seat for a comedy called &quot;Dancing Partner&quot; at the Belasco Theatre; Gransky was surprised because he and Crater had already seen a preview of the show. Crater then ate dinner at Billy Haas&#x27;s Chophouse at 332 West 45th Street with Ritz and William Klein, a lawyer friend. Crater&#x27;s dinner companions gave differing accounts of his departure from the restaurant. Klein initially testified that &quot;the judge got into a taxicab outside the restaurant about 9:30 p.m. and drove west on Forty-fifth Street.&quot; This account was initially confirmed by Ritz: &quot;At the sidewalk Judge Crater took a taxicab.&quot; Klein and Ritz later changed their story and said that they had entered a taxi outside the restaurant, but Crater had walked down the street.

Crater&#x27;s disappearance did not elicit any immediate reaction. When he did not return to Maine after ten days, his wife began making calls to their friends in New York, asking whether anyone had seen him. His fellow justices became alarmed when Crater failed to appear for the opening of the courts on August 25; they started a private investigation but failed to find any trace of him. The police were notified on September 3, and after that the missing judge was front-page news.

===Investigation===
Detectives discovered that the judge&#x27;s safe deposit box had been emptied and the two briefcases that Crater and Mara had taken to his apartment were missing. These promising leads were quickly lost amid thousands of false reports from people claiming to have seen the missing judge. A grand jury convened in October 1930 called 95 witnesses and amassed 975 pages of testimony. Mrs. Crater refused to appear. The jury concluded that &quot;the evidence is insufficient to warrant any expression of opinion as to whether Crater is alive or dead, or as to whether he has absented himself voluntarily, or is the sufferer from disease in the nature of amnesia, or is the victim of crime.&quot;

Crater enjoyed the city&#x27;s nightlife; he socialized with many showgirls in addition to his long-term mistress Connie Marcus. Two of these women left town abruptly after his disappearance. Sally Lou Ritz (real name Sarah Ritzi; 1907/1908–2000) had dined with Crater the evening that he vanished and was also rumored to be his mistress; she left New York in August or September 1930. She was found in late September 1930 living in Youngstown, Ohio with her parents; she said that she had left New York because she had received word that her father was ill. She was still being subjected to interviews by police investigating the Crater case in 1937, by which time she was living in Beverly Hills, California. June Brice, another showgirl, had been seen talking to Crater the day before he disappeared. A lawyer acting for Crater&#x27;s wife argued that Brice had been at the center of a scheme to blackmail Crater (the reason for the bank withdrawals on the day of his disappearance) and that a gangster boyfriend of Brice had killed the judge. Brice disappeared the day that a grand jury was to convene on the case. In 1948, she was discovered in a mental hospital.

Crater&#x27;s jacket was reportedly found in the apartment of Vivian Gordon. She was involved in high-end prostitution and linked to madam Polly Adler. Gordon had liaisons with a large number of influential businessmen and was the owner, on paper at least, of a number of properties believed to be fronts for illegal activity. She was also seen around town with gangster Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond, with whom Crater was rumored to socialize. Crater had known Diamond&#x27;s former boss, organized crime figure Arnold Rothstein, and had been extremely upset at Rothstein&#x27;s murder. Gordon was angry about a conviction that had resulted in her losing custody of her 16 year-old daughter. On February 20, 1931, she met with a lawyer for the Seabury Commission and offered to testify about police graft. She was murdered five days later. The publicity surrounding Gordon&#x27;s killing led to the resignation of a policeman whom she had accused of framing her, and the suicide of her daughter. The scandal also refocused attention on the corruption investigation, which ultimately led to the resignation of Mayor Jimmy Walker and largely eliminated Tammany Hall&#x27;s hold on the city, previously weakened by Rothstein and the conflict over his former empire.

Crater&#x27;s wife found envelopes containing checks, stocks, bonds, and a note from the justice on January 20, 1931, six months after his disappearance. They were in a dresser drawer that had been empty when searched by police. The discovery led to new but ultimately inconclusive leads, and no further trace of Crater was ever found. The case was officially closed in 1979.

===Subsequent events===
Mrs. Crater remained at their vacation home in Maine during the search for her husband, until her discovery of the hidden envelopes. She was evicted from the Fifth Avenue apartment for non-payment of rent. In July 1937, when she was reportedly living on $12 per week () working as a telephone operator in Maine, she petitioned to have the justice declared officially dead. She married Carl Kunz, a New York City electrical contractor, in Elkton, on April 23, 1938. Kunz&#x27;s first wife had hanged herself eight days before the wedding. Crater was declared legally dead in 1939; his widow received $20,561 in life insurance (equivalent to about $ in ). She separated from Kunz in 1950 and died in 1969 at age 70.

Mrs. Crater expressed her belief that her husband had been murdered in her own account of the case, &quot;The Empty Robe&quot;, which was written with freelance writer and journalist Oscar Fraley and published by Doubleday in 1961.

On August 19, 2005, authorities revealed that after Queens resident Stella Ferrucci-Good&#x27;s death at age 91, they had received notes she wrote in which she claimed that her husband, NYPD detective Robert Good, had learned that Crater was killed by Charles Burns, an NYPD officer who also worked as a bodyguard of Murder, Inc. enforcer Abe Reles, and by Burns&#x27; brother, Frank. According to the letter, Crater was buried near West Eighth Street in Coney Island, Brooklyn, at the current site of the New York Aquarium.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews/2005/08/19/1930-crater&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews/WNT/1050195&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Police reported that no records had been found to indicate that skeletal remains had been discovered at that site when it was excavated in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/2005/08/20/20crater&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Richard J. Tofel, the author of a 2004 book on the Crater case, &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, expressed skepticism of Ferrucci-Good&#x27;s account.

==Popular culture==
The phrase &quot;to pull a Judge Crater&quot;, or simply &quot;to pull a Crater&quot;, means to disappear. It is no longer widely used. For many years following Crater&#x27;s disappearance, &quot;Judge Crater, call your office&quot; was a standard gag of nightclub comedians. As a publicity stunt for their 1933 film &quot;Bureau of Missing Persons&quot;, First National Pictures promised in advertisements to pay Crater $10,000 () if he claimed it in person at the box office. Crater&#x27;s last letter, possibly written on the day of his disappearance, was sold at auction on June 22, 1981, for $700. The letter was marked &quot;confidential&quot; and began: &quot;The following money is due me from the persons named. Get in touch with them for they will surely pay their debts.&quot; It was incorrectly reported that this letter was Crater&#x27;s will.

The judge was popularly known amongst friends as &quot;Good Time Joe&quot;, from his fun times with showgirls and his love for dancing. After his disappearance, the press would use this nickname as one of the common ways to refer to him; in addition to calling him the &quot;Missingest Man in America&quot;.

In Frank O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s 1964 science-fiction novel &#x27;Instant Gold&#x27;, one unexpected result of a national dragnet is that &quot;for a brief, glorious moment, CIA agents investigating the Lake Superior copper town of Houghton, Michigan, reported the discovery of Judge Crater&quot;.

A 1972 episode of &quot;Night Gallery&quot; titled &quot;Rare Objects&quot; features a character who has kidnapped a number of well-known historical figures who either disappeared or supposedly died without leaving a body, including Crater, Amelia Earhart, and Roald Amundsen.

The characters on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; make jokes about Crater in several episodes, including &quot;12 to the Moon&quot; and &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;.

<doc id="583323" wikidata="Q888240" url="?curid=583323" title="Hisamuddin of Selangor">
<text>Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj Ibni Almarhum Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah (Jawi: ; 13 May 1898 – 1 September 1960) was Sultan of Selangor from 1938 to 1942, later from 1945, and the second Yang di-Pertuan Agong of the Federation of Malaya from 14 April, until his death on 1 September 1960.

==Early life and education==

He was the third son of Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah ibni Raja Muda Musa (1863–1938) by Cik Puan Hasnah binti Pilong, a commoner wife. Named Tengku Alam Shah at birth, he was not expected to succeed as he had two elder half-brothers.

Educated at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Malay College Old Boys Association in 1929. In 1931, he was appointed Tengku Laksamana of Selangor, having previously served as Tengku Panglima Raja.

==Selangor succession dispute==

Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah had multiple children, his first three sons being Tengku Musa Eddin, Tengku Badar Shah and Tengku Alam Shah. The first two sons were children by his royal consort, Tengku Ampuan Maharum binti Tengku Dhiauddin of the royal house of Kedah. In 1903, Tunku Musa Eddin had been made &quot;tengku mahkota&quot; and was promoted to r&quot;aja muda&quot; (heir apparent) in 1920.

However, at the instigation of the British Resident, Theodore Samuel Adams (1885–1961; in office 1935–1937), Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as &quot;raja muda&quot; in 1934 for alleged &quot;misbehaviour&quot;. Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin of being a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling. However, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin&#x27;s dismissal was his refusal to follow Adams&#x27; orders.

Although Sultan Sulaiman pleaded for the case of Tengku Musa Eddin (even petitioning the Secretary of State for the Colonies and discussing the issue directly with him in London), Tengku Alam Shah was instead proclaimed &quot;raja muda&quot; over his other half-brother Tengku Badar. The appointment occurred on 20 July 1936.

==First reign as Sultan of Selangor==

Tengku Alam Shah was proclaimed sultan on 4 April 1938, four days after the death of his father. On 26 January 1939, he was crowned at the Istana Mahkota Puri in Klang. Tengku Musa Eddin, then Tengku Kelana Jaya Putera, presided over the ceremony.

==Japanese occupation==

On 15 January 1942, Colonel Fujiyama, the Japanese Military Governor of Selangor, invited Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah to the King&#x27;s House in Kuala Lumpur. In an interview with Major-General Minaki, the Sultan confessed that he had made speeches in support of the British war efforts but had been persuaded by the British Resident to do so. After being told to surrender the regalia to his older brother, the Japanese removed Sultan Alam Shah and in November 1943, proclaimed Tengku Musa Eddin as Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah of Selangor.

Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah declined to work with the Japanese and from 1943, refused the allowance they gave him and his children.

==Second reign as Sultan of Selangor==

The return of the British brought Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah back to the throne, while Sultan Musa was exiled to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Although he had signed the Malayan Union treaty, like all other Malay rulers, he later repudiated it and gave open support to Malay nationalist effort to stop the plan.

On 1 March 1946, Sultan Alam Shah officiated the First Malay Unity Congress at the Sultan Sulaiman Club in Kuala Lumpur which was instrumental in creating the United Malays National Organisation. The congress was organised by the Selangor Malay Society which had as its president the scholar Zainal Abidin Ahmad (Za&#x27;ba), a critic of British colonial rule. 

==Election as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong==

On 31 August 1957, by eight votes to one, Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah was elected Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya.

==Election as Yang di-Pertuan Agong==

Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah was elected second Yang di-Pertuan Agong of independent Malaya on the death of Tuanku Abdul Rahman. His term of office began on 14 April 1960. On 30 July 1960 he proclaimed the end of the Malayan Emergency.

==Death and funeral==

Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah died from an unidentified illness at the Istana Tetamu, in Kuala Lumpur on 1 September 1960, aged 62, the day set for his installation as Yang di-Pertuan Agong. He was interred at the Royal Mausoleum near Sultan Sulaiman Mosque in Klang, Selangor on 3 September 1960.

==Personal life and family==

Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah was married at least twice:
# in 1920 to Raja Jemaah binti Raja Ahmad (1900–1973), a member of a junior branch of the Selangor royal family, who served as Tengku Ampuan of Selangor and Raja Permaisuri Agong
# in 1927 to Kalsom binti Mahmud (1905–1990), who was the mother of Tengku Ampuan Besar Bariah of Terengganu.
# after 1927 to Raja Halija binti Al-Marhum Sultan Idris Murshidul Azzam Shah Rahmatullah of Perak and Cik Haji Ngah Uteh Mariah binti Haji Sulaiman, daughter of &quot;Dato&quot; Haji Sulaiman and Fatimah binti To&#x27; Bandar Lambin

He was succeeded by his son by Raja Jemaah, Tengku Abdul Aziz Shah, as Sultan of Selangor, taking the title of Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah. Sultan Salahuddin later became the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Agong and also died while in office.

<doc id="583325" wikidata="Q4200614" url="?curid=583325" title="Putra of Perlis">
<text>Tuanku Sir Syed Harun Putra ibni Almarhum Syed Hassan Jamalullail (Jawi: ; 25 November 1920 – 16 April 2000) was the Raja of Perlis from 1945 until his death in 2000, and the third Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), from 1960 to 1965.

==Early career==
Putra was born in Arau and was the son of Syed Hassan bin Syed Mahmud Jamalullail (1897 – 18 October 1935), sometime &quot;bakal raja&quot; or heir presumptive to the throne of Perlis, by his commoner wife Wan Teh binti Wan Endut (1898 – 27 December 1952). He was educated at the Arau Malay School and later at Penang Free School between 1937 and 1939. At 18, he joined the Perlis administrative service, becoming a magistrate and in 1940, was transferred to Kuala Lumpur to serve as Second Magistrate in the Criminal Court.

==Perlis succession dispute==
The fourth Raja of Perlis, Syed Alwi ibni Syed Safi Jamalullail (born 1881; ) was childless and had several half-brothers competing for the role of heir presumptive. Succession to the Perlisian throne was not automatic and an heir presumptive had to be confirmed in that post by the State Council comprising the raja and several others.

Syed Putra&#x27;s paternal grandfather Syed Mahmud (died 1919), was the oldest son of Raja Syed Safi ibni Almarhum Syed Alwi Jamalullail (the third Raja). He was also a half brother of Raja Syed Alwi. He served as raja muda until 1912 when he was convicted and jailed in Alor Star, Kedah until 1917. Two years later, he died in Alor Star. On 6 December 1934, Syed Mahmud&#x27;s son Syed Hassan was, by a three to one vote, selected by the State Council as &quot;bakal raja&quot; or heir presumptive. However, Syed Hassan died on 18 October 1935.

On 30 April 1938, again by a three to one vote, the State Council chose Syed Putra (son of Syed Hassan) as the &quot;bakal raja&quot;. This choice was opposed by Syed Hamzah, the younger half-brother of Raja Syed Alwi and Vice-President of the State Council on the grounds that Syed Putra was too far removed from the throne under Islamic inheritance laws (primogeniture did not then apply in Perlis). However, the British colonial rulers supported Syed Putra.

==Japanese occupation==
At the outbreak of the Pacific War, Raja Syed Alwi retreated to Kuala Kangsar, Perak. He returned to Perlis on 28 December 1941 but was already very ill and state affairs were exercised by Syed Hamzah. Syed Putra was at the time serving in the judiciary in Kuala Lumpur and had been advised by Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah of Selangor to remain there. In May 1942, Syed Hamzah persuaded Raja Syed Alwi to withdraw Syed Putra&#x27;s appointment as &quot;bakal raja&quot; and instead Syed Hamzah himself was appointed to that post. Raja Syed Alwi died in Arau on 1 February 1943 and a day later, before the funeral, Syed Hamzah was proclaimed fifth Raja of Perlis, by the consent of the Japanese Military Governor of Kedah and Perlis.

Syed Putra and his family stayed in Klang until 15 May 1942 when he returned to Perlis. He lived in a hut near the Arau railway station and received a monthly allowance of $90 from Raja Syed Alwi but this ceased on the latter&#x27;s death. On 29 March 1945 he left for Kelantan, the home state of his consort Tengku Budriah, where he sold cakes and sundry goods for a living.

==Return of the British==
The British Military Administration (BMA) under Lord Mountbatten refused to recognise Syed Hamzah as Raja. On 18 September 1945, Syed Hamzah abdicated. He went into exile in Thailand and died in Arau on 20 February 1958.

On 4 December 1945 the British proclaimed Syed Putra as sixth Raja of Perlis. He returned to Perlis from Kelantan, via Padang Besar. He was installed on 12 March 1949.

==Malayan Union==
Raja Syed Putra objected to the Malayan Union treaty on the grounds that it contravened the 1930 British-Perlis Treaty giving governing power to the raja-in-council. However, his protests that he signed under duress was rejected by the British. Subsequently, like all other Malay rulers, Raja Syed Putra refused the Malayan Union treaty.

==Election as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong==
Raja Syed Putra was elected Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong by the Malay rulers and served in that office from 14 April 1960 until the death of Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah on 1 September 1960.

==Yang di-Pertuan Agong==
Raja Syed Putra was elected as the third Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaya and served in that office from 21 September 1960. At 39 years and 301 days, he is the youngest Yang di-Pertuan Agong ever elected. He was installed at the Istana Negara on 4 January 1961. On 16 September 1963 Malaya, British Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore unified into the Federation of Malaysia. He completed his term in office on 20 September 1965. His son, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin was elected as the 12th Yang di-Pertuan Agong and served from 2001 to 2006 after the death of the incumbent, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah.

Raja Syed Putra&#x27;s term of office as Yang di-Pertuan Agong was marked by the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation between newly created Malaysia and its larger neighbour, Indonesia. He offered to stay on as Yang di-Pertuan Agong at the end of his term, to see out the end of confrontation, but this suggestion was rejected by Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.

As Yang di-Pertuan Agong, he instructed proper treatment of the royal regalia, which he believed was partly responsible for the mysterious illness and death of Sultan Hisamuddin of Selangor, his immediate predecessor.

==Later role==
Raja Syed Putra became the doyen of the Malay rulers, giving advice to more junior rulers especially during the constitutional crisis with the Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in 1983 and 1993.

== Death ==
He died at the National Heart Institute, Kuala Lumpur on 16 April 2000 from a heart attack. At that time, he was the longest reigning monarch in the world, a position he inherited from Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein in 1989. He was buried at the Royal Mausoleum in Arau, Perlis.

==Family life==
Tuanku Syed Putra married twice:
# in 1941 to Tengku Budriah binti Tengku Ismail (1924–2008) of the Patani Sultanate in Thailand. She served as his consort with the title of Raja Perempuan of Perlis and as Raja Permaisuri Agong. She is the mother of the current Raja of Perlis, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin as well as five sons and five daughters.
# in 1952 to Che Puan Mariam (née ; 23 April 1923–1986) by whom he had three sons and one daughter. She was a Thai Muslim from Bangkok and Miss Siam in 1939.

<doc id="583329" wikidata="Q508133" url="?curid=583329" title="Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu">
<text>Sultan Sir Ismail Nasiruddin Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Zainal Abidin III Mu’azzam Shah (Jawi: ; 24 January 1907 – 20 September 1979) was the Sultan of Terengganu from 1945 until his death in 1979, and the fourth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, (King of Malaysia), from 1965 to 1970.

== Early career ==
The date of his birth has been given as either 16 March 1906 or 24 January 1907, the latter being the one more often used. Born in Kuala Terengganu, he was the fifth, and third surviving, son of Sultan Zainal Abidin III of Terengganu (). His mother was a Thai Muslim convert, &quot;Cik&quot; Maimuna binti Abdullah, who died in 1918.

Educated at the Kuala Terengganu Malay School, he then went to the Malay College. In 1929, he entered the Terengganu administrative service. In 1934, he was appointed Assistant Collector of Land Revenue in Kuala Terengganu.

In 1935, he became aide-de-camp to his elder half brother Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah, accompanying him to the coronation of King George VI on 12 May 1937. In 1939, he became Registrar of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. He also served as the Land Court Registrar. In 1940, he was appointed a minister of the Terengganu state cabinet, having been made &quot;Tengku Sri Paduka Raja&quot;. In 1941, he became First Class Magistrate and was promoted Terengganu State Secretary on 15 November 1941.

== Succession dispute ==
Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Terengganu died on 25 September 1942 of blood poisoning. The Japanese Military Administration, which occupied Malaya at that time, proclaimed his son as the fifteenth Sultan of Terengganu styled as Sultan Ali Shah. On 18 October 1943, the Thai government under Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram took over the administration of Terengganu from the Japanese and continued to recognise Sultan Ali Shah.

When the British returned after the end of World War II, they declined to recognise Sultan Ali Shah. Allegedly, Ali Shah was in too much debt and had been too close to the Japanese during their occupation. According to Ali Shah, the British Military Administration wanted him removed for his refusal to sign the Malayan Union treaty.

The British Military Administration also disapproved of Ali Shah&#x27;s character, where he was said to have repudiated his official consort, Tengku Seri Nila Utama Pahang (the daughter of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang) and had a second marriage with a former prostitute.

On 5 November 1945 the Terengganu State Council of thirteen members announced the dismissal of Sultan Ali Shah and the appointment of Tengku Ismail as the fifteenth Sultan of Terengganu. Tengku Ismail became known as Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah and was installed on 6 June 1949 at the Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu.

Ali Shah continued to dispute his dismissal until his death on 17 May 1996.

== Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong ==
Sultan Ismail served as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong from 21 September 1960 to 20 September 1965.

== Yang di-Pertuan Agong ==
Sultan Ismail was elected the fourth Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia) and served in that office from 21 September 1965 to 20 September 1970.

Sultan Ismail&#x27;s reign was at a time when Malaysia began to be active internationally, having secured a more solid foundation as a Federation of Malay States, Sabah and Sarawak. Many visits by world leaders were made including US President Lyndon B. Johnson, West German President Heinrich Lübke, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, General Ne Win of Burma and Prime Minister Nguyễn Cao Kỳ of South Vietnam. The security of the country was more secure during his reign as the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation had ended and the Philippines sought normal relations (after its claim of Sabah) with Malaysia. Due to health reasons he wanted to resign as Yang di-Pertuan Agong in 1969, but was persuaded by Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman not to do so as the next Yang di-Pertuan Agong would be Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s nephew (Tuanku Abdul Halim of Kedah) and the Tunku felt it was not right for him to continue in office during that time. In his farewell speech at the end of his and Sultan Ismail&#x27;s term as Yang Di Pertuan Agong, Tunku Abdul Rahman declared that the event signified &quot;the end of the first chapter of Malaysia&#x27;s history&quot;.

Sultan Ismail was reigning as Yang di-Pertuan Agong when the May 13 incident sparked race riots in Kuala Lumpur and parliament was suspended. Despite this event, Tunku Abdul Rahman described Sultan Ismail&#x27;s reign as &quot;a most eventful and glorious one&quot;. Sultan Ismail launched the Rukun Negara, the Malaysian declaration of national philosophy on 31 August 1970.

== Death and funeral ==
Sultan Ismail died at the Istana Badariah, Padang Seri Negara, Mukim Batu Burok, Kuala Terengganu on 20 September 1979 after suffering from two heart attacks and was buried a day later at the Abidin Mosque, Royal Mausoleum, Kuala Terengganu. He was succeeded by Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah, his eldest son. He died exactly nine years later after his tenure as Yang di Pertuan Agong ended on 20 September 1970.

== Family and personal life ==
Sultan Ismail married four times:

# Che Wan Aminah binti Che Wan Chik, by whom he had two daughters
# in 1928 to Tengku Tengah Zaharah binti Tengku Setia Raja Pahang Tengku Umar bin Sultan Ahmad Pahang (1912–1977; divorced) by whom he had eight children including his successor as sultan of Terengganu, Sultan Mahmud
# in 1944 to Tengku Intan Zaharah binti Tengku Setia Raja Terengganu Tengku Hitam Umar (1928-2015) sometime Tengku Ampuan Besar of Terengganu, Raja Permaisuri Agong and eventually made Tengku Ampuan Tua of Terengganu
# Che Jarah binti Abdullah, by whom he had one daughter

Ismail was an amateur photographer. His photographic works date from 1923 to 1979. A monograph of his life as photographer was written and published in August 2013 by his grandson and heir of his photograph archives, Raja Mohd Zainol Ihsan Shah.

<doc id="583331" wikidata="Q4200577" url="?curid=583331" title="Yahya Petra of Kelantan">
<text>Sultan Yahya Petra ibni Almarhum Sultan Ibrahim (Jawi: ; 10 December 1917 – 29 March 1979) was Sultan of Kelantan from 1960, and the sixth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the constitutional monarch of Malaysia, from 1975, until his death in 1979.

==Early life==

He was born on 10 December 1917, as Tengku Yahya Petra at the Istana Balai Besar in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. He was the second son of Sultan Ibrahim (b. 1897; ) by his third wife, &quot;Cik&quot; Embong binti &quot;Encik&quot; Daud (1899–1971).

Tengku Yahya Petra was raised by his childless uncle, Tengku Ismail (later Sultan Ismail). He was sent to the Francis Light School in Penang before continuing his studies in England. His uncle, Sultan Ismail, appointed him &quot;Tengku Temenggong Kelantan&quot; on 21 July 1939. He was later promoted to &quot;Tengku Bendahara Kelantan&quot; on 6 February 1945 by his father, Sultan Ibrahim. He served in various Kelantan civil service posts from 1941 to 1948.

==Kelantan succession dispute==
Tengku Indra Petra was the eldest son of Sultan Ibrahim and elder brother of Sultan Yahya Petra. After Sultan Ibrahim succeeded his brother Sultan Ismail, Tengku Indra Petra was appointed heir apparent with the title of &quot;Raja Muda Kelantan&quot; on 25 October 1944. However, due to conflict with his father, he was dismissed from the post and removed from the line of succession by his father&#x27;s decree on 1 February 1948. On the same day, Sultan Yahya Petra replaced his brother as heir apparent with the new title of &quot;Tengku Mahkota Kelantan&quot;.

Tengku Indra Petra became a politician and was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1955 Malayan general election. Tengku Indra&#x27;s descendants have since disputed their family&#x27;s exclusion from Kelantan&#x27;s line of succession.

Tengku Indra Petra did not preside over the installation of Sultan Yahya Petra&#x27;s successor, Sultan Ismail Petra, It was Tengku Panglima Raja Tengku Ahmad who presided over installations of Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Yahya Petra and Sultan Ismail Petra. Tengku Panglima Raja was the father of the former Sultanah of Johor, Sultanah Zanariah binti Tengku Ahmad.

==Accession==
Sultan Yahya Petra (as he became) succeeded his father a day after the latter&#x27;s death on 9 July 1960. He was crowned on 17 July 1961 at Istana Balai Besar in Kota Bharu.

==Election as Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong==
Sultan Yahya Petra served as the Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the federal deputy king, between 21 September 1970 and 20 September 1975.

==Election as Yang di-Pertuan Agong==
During the election of the sixth Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), the most senior ruler Sultan Ismail of Johor declined to be considered. Sultan Yahya Petra also declined nomination at first due to having suffered a serious stroke, but changed his mind and was duly elected. His term began from 21 September 1975.

==Kingship==
Malaysia&#x27;s second prime minister Abdul Razak Hussein died on 14 January 1976 less than four months into Sultan Yahya Petra&#x27;s reign as Yang di-Pertuan Agong.

In 1977 a state of emergency was declared in his own state following a political crisis and violence.

==Death and funeral==
Sultan Yahya Petra died of an apparent heart attack at 3:45 pm at the National Palace on 29 March 1979. His coffin lay in state at the National Palace for a day and was then taken by plane to Kota Bharu where it was buried at the Kelantan Royal Mausoleum.

==Family life==
He was married to Tengku Zainab binti &quot;Tengku Sri Utama Raja&quot; Tengku Muhammad Petra (1917–1993), who was styled &quot;Raja Perempuan&quot; Zainab II (her stepmother-in-law was Raja Perempuan Zainab I, consort of Sultan Ibrahim) and Raja Permaisuri Agong. Sultan Yahya Petra and Raja Perempuan Zainab II had one son and six daughters. However, two of their daughters died when they were young. He also married Tengku Alexandria binti Tengku Yusof and was given a son.

==Issue==

<text>Williams Street Productions, LLC, (formerly known as Ghost Planet Industries) is an American animation and live action television production studio owned by the Warner Bros. Television Studios division of Warner Bros., a unit of Warner Bros. Discovery. The studio is the in-house production arm of Adult Swim (the programming block on Cartoon Network). Mike Lazzo and Keith Crofford oversaw operations for the building for most of its existence.

On December 16, 2019, co-founder Lazzo retired from the company, with business partner and co-founder Crofford retiring the following year. Michael Ouweleen was named president of Adult Swim on April 29, 2020.

From November 27, 2019 to July 1, 2020 and since May 13, 2022, Ouweleen was named president of The Cartoon Network, Inc., which also oversees Adult Swim.

== History ==
In 1976, Ted Turner bought the building and used it for his own television station, WTCG. This new channel was the result of a recent UHF takeover. In December 1976, the first WTCG signal was beamed via satellite to its four cable systems located around Georgia. This broadcast was the first use of non-pay-service satellite transmission, an innovation that would come to revolutionize basic cable nationwide.

Starting out as a minor local channel, the station grew into success and was re-launched as WTBS in 1979. Then, after a five-year period, WTBS was renamed TBS Superstation. During this time, Turner also created CNN, a 24-hour news network. Both became the standard for cable providers by the late 80s. Due to this success, the studio building became too small to operate as a headquarters. A new campus was built across the street for the expanding Turner empire. Upon completion, Turner launched Cartoon Network to showcase their recent acquisitions of the vast MGM and Hanna-Barbera library of cartoons.

When Turner moved out of the Williams Street building, they kept ownership, using it as a storage facility. Although no longer its main purpose, to this day, Williams Street houses all the show tapes for Turner Networks. Appointed to run the building were veteran Turner employees such as Keith Crofford, Andy Merrill, and former mail-room employee Mike Lazzo. Although Cartoon Network was run at Hanna-Barbera Studios at the time, certain duties were eventually controlled by the trio at Williams Street. One of their most important early tasks was producing host segments for &quot;The Moxy Pirate Show&quot; (later &quot;The Moxy Show&quot;).

From 1990 to 1993, TBS had started its own original programming such as &quot;Captain Planet&quot; and &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;. This interested the team at Williams Street, and they all wished to create their own series. Towards the end of &#x27;93, the three mustered up courage to approach Ted Turner with their ideas for Cartoon Network original programming. It didn&#x27;t go as planned and they were eventually kicked out of Ted&#x27;s office. According to Lazzo, they were clearly told that unless CN started making more money for Turner, they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed funding or a chance. They didn&#x27;t listen.

They decided to produce their own series pilot. On a shoestring budget, they tried to come up with compatible ideas. During brainstorming, they realized they could simply re-use footage of any animation in the Turner library. They eventually settled on &quot;Space Ghost and Dino Boy&quot;. Because they felt it would fit, they paired it with Mike Lazzo&#x27;s idea of a satirical talk show with a clueless host asking guests a stream of stupid questions. The final pilot featured rotoscoped animation superimposed on a simple background and used CNN interview footage for the live-action interview.

They went back to Turner and presented the pilot, and &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; was then greenlit for a ten-episode season. Work began, and the minor CN production/storage facility became its own studio, named after &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;&#x27;s own in-show one: Ghost Planet Industries. Soon the series was acquiring its first C and D-list celebrity guests, small animation and writing crew, and voice actors. The voice actor for Space Ghost was local voice actor George Lowe; all other roles were done by the GPI crew. The series eventually premiered on April 14, 1994. This marked Cartoon Network&#x27;s first original series and the first animated talk show in history.

Due to its more mature surreal humor, the series attracted a devoted cult audience. Its success led to a special that was simulcast on TBS, a special short for VHS release of blockbuster &quot;The Mask&quot;, and much more famous guests. In the height of popularity, it was awarded its own spin-off. Turner commissioned GPI to produce some sort of lighter version for TBS, due to a need for children&#x27;s programming. &quot;Cartoon Planet&quot; premiered on TBS in 1995 and later moved to Cartoon Network in 1996. The series featured Space Ghost hosting segments and cartoons for young viewers. After two seasons, TBS decided to cancel all kids&#x27; programming, following the trend of TNT and USA.

== Name and logo ==
The current name of the company originates from the location of its headquarters building (which is also the home office for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim) at 1065 Williams Street NW in Atlanta, Georgia near the current offices of TBS and TNT on Techwood Drive. The facility began as a carpet factory and was purchased by Turner as overflow offices for, among other things, set building and woodworking facilities, as well as CNN Field Engineering. Soon after CNN moved into the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta in the early 1980s, other Turner operations moved into the Techwood campus, an old country club which became the first headquarters for CNN. The street is named for early Atlanta settler Ammi Williams.

The company&#x27;s original name, Ghost Planet Industries, came from Space Ghost&#x27;s fictional planet, where the animated talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; was purportedly filmed.

The studio&#x27;s production logo features a wavy, blurred gray image of Space Ghost&#x27;s fictional studio, with the words &quot;Williams Street&quot; beneath it. The soundtrack of Jack Webb&#x27;s Mark VII Limited&#x27;s production logo (a rumbling drum roll and two clinks of a hammer) is often used while the GPI/Williams Street production card is shown.

=== Music ===

Williams Street formed their own music label, Williams Street Records. The label was created after Jason DeMarco, Adult Swim&#x27;s vice president of strategic marketing and promotions, worked on Danger Doom, a project with Danger Mouse and MF Doom in 2005. Danger Mouse had previously worked on the music for &quot;Toonami&quot; and wanted to do an album that sampled that work. The group suggested the idea to Mike Lazzo; the project was successful. Williams Street Records now releases a majority of the music related to their shows. The label is managed by DeMarco.

== Homages ==
1065, the street number for Williams Street, is also the hull number for &quot;FishCenter Live&quot;″s USS &quot;FishCenterprise&quot; (a parody of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;).

<text>Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta’in Billah ibni Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mu’azzam Shah (Jawi: ; 24 October 1930 – 22 May 2019) was Sultan of Pahang from 1974 until his abdication in 2019, and the seventh Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), from 1979 to 1984. His abdication as sultan was decided by the Royal Council at an extraordinary meeting on 11 January 2019. A special amendment was passed on the state constitution that gave the body more power for this decision, citing the Sultan&#x27;s incapability to rule due to his failing health. The abdication was announced the next day which was retroactively effective on the day of the Royal Council meeting, paving the way to his son, Abdullah to succeed him as sultan immediately, and subsequently be elected as the next Yang di-Pertuan Agong later the same month.

==Biography==

Ahmad Shah was born on 24 October 1930 at the Istana Mangga Tunggal, Pekan, Pahang. He was the only son of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang () by his official and royal consort, Tengku Ampuan Besar Raja Fatimah binti Almarhum Sultan Iskandar Shah Kaddasullah (1910–1988), a princess of Perak&#x27;s royal family.

A student of the Malay College Kuala Kangsar, he received diplomas in public administration from Worcester College, Oxford and the University of Exeter. He succeeded his father as sultan in 1974.

His election as the 7th Yang di-Pertuan Agong in 1979 was marked with controversy as he was said to be at odds with the incoming prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. However, the rumours proved to be untrue and he proved to be a keen admirer of the prime minister. Twenty-two years earlier, his father Abu Bakar had failed five times to be elected as the first Agong.

A controversial, headstrong personality, he has often forced his chief ministers in Pahang to resign over minor differences.

His favourite hobbies were playing football, golf, polo, and equestrian activities.

Sultan Ahmad Shah was a keen sportsman and was the President of the Malaysian Football Association (FAM) from 1984 until 2014, the President of Asian Football Confederation (AFC) until 2002 and Asean Football Federation (AFF) from 2011 until 2019.

His official and royal consort, Tengku Ampuan Afzan, a member of the Terengganu royal family, served as his Raja Permaisuri Agong but died of cancer on her return to Pahang on 29 June 1988. They had seven children, Tengku Meriam, Tengku Muhaini, Tengku Aishah Marcella, Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri&#x27;ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, Tengku Abdul Rahman, Tengku Nong Fatimah and Tengku Shahariah. Sultan Ahmad Shah&#x27;s second wife Kalsom Abdullah (&quot;nee&quot; Anita), was designated as the Sultanah of Pahang in 1991. They then had a child, Tengku Fahad Mua&#x27;adzam Shah. 

==Abdication and death==

After being ill for some time, Sultan Ahmad Shah abdicated with effect from 11 January 2019 (when it was Pahang&#x27;s turn to provide the Agong) upon the amendment of the state&#x27;s constitution. On 22 May 2019, Sultan Ahmad Shah died at 8:50 am at the National Heart Institute, Kuala Lumpur at age 88. He was laid to rest next to the grave of his late wife, Tengku Ampuan Afzan at the Pahang Royal Mausoleum near Abu Bakar Royal Mosque in Pekan, Pahang. The state of Pahang observed 40 days of mourning, and Pahangese flags across the state were flown at half-mast, while all entertainment events for the next 3 days were cancelled.

<doc id="583340" wikidata="Q375278" url="?curid=583340" title="Iskandar of Johor">
<text>Sultan Iskandar ibni Almarhum Sultan Ismail (Jawi: ; 8 April 1932 – 22 January 2010) was Sultan of Johor, succeeding his father Sultan Ismail upon the latter&#x27;s death in 1981. He reigned as the eighth Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the constitutional monarch of Malaysia, from 1984 to 1989. Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s reign as Sultan of Johor lasted almost 29 years until his death in 2010. 

His children are married into the different royal houses of Malaysia. His eldest daughter Tunku Kamariah married the Tengku Laksamana of Selangor, Tengku Sulaiman Shah. His successor and eldest son Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar married Raja Zarith Sofiah of the Perak Royal Family. His daughter Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah married the heir apparent of Pahang, now Sultan Abdullah. His younger son Tunku Abdul Majid married a member of the Kedah Royal Family, Tunku Teh Mazni.

As was the case with his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s independent mindset resulted in strained relations with the Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was most prevalent during his time as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, as there were a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis. His time as the Sultan of Johor was marred by accusations of violence and brutality. Sultan Iskandar was notorious for his bad temper which often resulted in violent episodes of rage and brutality to members of his staff and the general public. The 1992 Gomez incident surrounding the Sultan eventually culminated in the removal of &quot;legal immunity&quot; for members of the royal family.

Sultan Iskandar is reputed to have been a staunch disciplinarian, with willingness to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a person with a warm and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.

During his younger days as a prince, Iskandar was commonly known by his first name, &quot;Mahmood&quot; or his full name &quot;Mahmood Iskandar&quot;. He largely discontinued the use of his first name after he became Sultan in 1981, although some people occasionally referred to him by his full name.

==Early life==
Sultan Iskandar (known as Tunku Mahmood Iskandar until 1981) was the third and eldest surviving son of Sultan Ismail, (he had two older brothers, both of whom died in infancy) and was born on at 11:30 a.m. 8 April 1932 in the Istana Semayam, Johor Bahru. Mahmood received his primary and lower secondary education in Ngee Heng Primary School and the English College Johore Bahru (now Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar) in Johor Bahru. In 1952, he was sent to Australia for higher secondary education at Trinity Grammar School. After completing high school in 1953, Mahmood travelled to the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom, where he was enrolled in the Upper Chine School for three years.

==Sultan of Johor==

Mahmood returned to Malaysia in 1956 upon completing his studies, and briefly served as a cadet officer in the Johor Civil Service, taking charge of affairs in District Affairs, Land and Treasury departments until his appointment as the Tunku Mahkota of Johor in May 1959. Mahmood was appointed the Tunku Mahkota of Johor from 1959 to 1961, and Raja Muda of Johor from 1966 to 1981, by Sultan Ismail. On 29 April 1981, he was re-appointed as the Tunku Mahkota shortly before his father&#x27;s death.

On 10 May 1981, Mahmood was appointed as the Regent of Johor following the death of his father, and was sworn in as Sultan a day later, shortly before his father was buried. In turn, his younger brother, Tunku Abdul Rahman (not to be confused with Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia&#x27;s first prime minister), formerly the Tunku Mahkota of Johor for twenty years under Sultan Ismail, was demoted to a lower position, the Tunku Bendahara of Johor, a post which he held until his death in 1989. In the same year on 12 December, Sultan Iskandar was appointed as the Chancellor of the University of Technology Malaysia. Unlike the other preceding Sultan of Johors who had their own coronation ceremony, he did not have one.

Under the council of rulers, the elective monarchy system of Malaysia, Sultan Iskandar was elected on 9 February 1984 as the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong, shortly before his predecessor&#x27;s term expired on 26 April 1984. He succeeded the Sultan of Pahang as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong on 26 April. A royal investiture was held shortly after that, in which he donned the traditional suit of the Agong, whereby he was officially installed. Sultan Iskandar served in the capacity as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong until 1989, being succeeded by the Sultan of Perak. As the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Iskandar was automatically designated under constitutional provisions as the Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, holding the rank of the Marshal of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, Admiral of the Fleet of the Royal Malaysian Navy and Field Marshal of the Army.

On 8 April 2006, the Sultan appointed his grandson Tunku Ismail Idris—the son of the Tunku Mahkota then—as the Raja Muda during an investiture in conjunction with his birthday. The rank of Raja Muda denoted that Ismail Idris was second in the line of succession to the Johorean royal throne.

===State affairs===
Sultan Iskandar held annual open house events either at the Istana Bukit Serene, his official residence, or at the Istana Besar. On these days, the Sultan and his eldest son, the Tunku Mahkota, held special sessions whereby Johoreans came up to pay their respects to him. The Sultan also bestowed honorary awards on distinguished Malaysians from his annual birthday honours list on his birthday. As a matter of convention, the state government made 8 April a state public holiday to mark his birthday.

Shortly before he became Agong in April 1984, Sultan Iskandar issued a proposal for the Orang Aslis to be referred to as the &quot;Bumiputera Asli&quot; (literally, Original Sons of the Soil). The proposal was made as Sultan Iskandar suggested that the Orang Aslis maintained a distinct identity from the Malays as the majority of them were not Muslims. The proposal was subsequently scrapped, and the government made subsequent attempts to assimilate the Orang Aslis with the mainstream Malay society. After his inauguration as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, he donated his Agong&#x27;s salary to various scholarship boards that were open to Malaysians of all races.
Sultan Iskandar issued a decree in 2007 which only allowed residences and properties owned by the Sultan and the Tunku Mahkota to be called Istana, while properties belonging to other members of the royal family are to be known as &quot;Kediaman&quot;. The terms &quot;Istana&quot; and &quot;Kediaman&quot; are translated as &quot;Palace&quot; and &quot;Residences&quot; in English, respectively. The following December, Sultan Iskandar gave his endorsement for the state government to pass a law which would ban Muslims in the state from practising Yoga, citing that Hindu elements in the exercise went against Islamic teachings. Applications to seek the Sultan&#x27;s consent came from the state religious council, who acted under the instructions of the National Fatwa Council.

Sultan Iskandar graced the official landmark opening of the Sultan Iskandar customs, immigration and quarantine complex on 1 December 2008, in the presence of the Tunku Mahkota and several key cabinet ministers. The complex was named in honour of the Sultan, who expressed optimism for its success during his opening speech.

===Foreign relations===
Since his ascension to the throne, Sultan Iskandar fostered particularly close ties with Singapore, by developing a personal rapport with top Singaporean leaders. This practice was also taken up by his sons, the Tunku Mahkota and Tunku Aris Bendahara. Media reports highlighted the particularly warm reception which leaders of both countries received whenever they visited each other&#x27;s domains, particularly in July 1988, when Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s visit to Singapore marked the first official visit by any Yang di-Pertuan Agong since 1957. Between these years, Sultan Iskandar has been awarded or been given the following awards by Singaporean political leaders:

* 1988: Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong received the Dato&#x27; Paduka Mahkota Johor (Kehormat) from the Sultan.
* 2007: Sultan Iskandar was presented with the Honorary Master Parachutist Wing by Singapore Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean.
* 2007: Conferred the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws by the National University of Singapore.

Relations with Singapore soured after the International Court of Justice ruled in Singapore&#x27;s favour following a long legal battle over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca. At the inaugural session of the 12th Johor State Assembly in 2008, the Sultan stated his continued support of Malaysia&#x27;s claim to Pedra Branca, and vowed to find legal means to retrieve the island&#x27;s sovereignty.

Sultan Iskandar also fostered a fairly close relationship with the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, particularly during his days as the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong. In 2006, they were again seen together in public, after Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah made a state visit to Johor to express his interest in the Iskandar Development Region.

==Controversies==

===Succession===
Prior to being the Sultan or Agong, and even during the 1980s and early 1990s, Mahmood&#x27;s reputation was marred by a number of controversial incidents which received occasional attention from the media. One of these earliest incidents was the loss of his status as Mahkota in 1961—a position which his father, Sultan Ismail, appointed him to two years earlier, citing reasons of alleged misbehaviour after confidential reports accusing him of incarcerating a policeman reached the Sultan. Iskandar&#x27;s younger brother, Abdul Rahman (Tunku Mahkota of Johor) was appointed as the Tunku Mahkota in favour of him. Nevertheless, in 1966, Mahmood Iskandar was appointed the Raja Muda—which put him second in line to the throne. In April 1981, Mahmood was reinstated as Mahkota shortly before his father&#x27;s death the following month and was subsequently installed as the Sultan of Johor, under the orders of his father.

However, some eyewitnesses challenged the legitimacy of Mahmood&#x27;s reappointment as the Mahkota, by arguing that they witnessed Sultan Ismail already having lapsed into coma at the time of his appointment as the regent. Records stated that Sultan Ismail lapsed into a coma on 8 May, three days before his death. Relations with the Menteri Besar of Johor, Othman Saat deteriorated when the latter questioned Iskandar&#x27;s legitimacy to the throne, which led to an incident which saw the Sultan issuing an order to the Menteri Besar to vacate his office within 24 hours, shortly after Sultan Ismail&#x27;s death, citing that he needed that office space for himself. The Menteri Besar heeded his order, though the Sultan did not move in as he had said. Othman Saat subsequently resigned the following year as the Menteri Besar.

===Criminal misconduct===
In 1972, Mahmood was charged with assault for using chemical mace on two men for overtaking his car and was convicted for his offence the following year. A year later, reports surfaced of another similar attack on a young couple, when Iskandar, together with his bodyguard, attacked them after they allegedly offended him. Another incident took place at about this time when Mahmood restrained two policemen in a dog kennel for a day after they had angered him.

Five years later, Mahmood was charged and convicted for manslaughter for shooting and killing a man near his private helicopter, whom he took to be a smuggler. In both cases, his father, Sultan Ismail, intervened and granted official pardons to Mahmood. Similarly, his eldest son, Tunku Ibrahim Ismail, was convicted in the 1980s for shooting a man to death in a nightclub during a feud, but was quickly pardoned.

In 1987, Sultan Iskandar was further accused of causing the death of a golf caddy in the Cameron Highlands by assault, following an incident in which the golf caddy laughed when the Sultan missed a shot. Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia&#x27;s first Prime Minister, pointed out that the Sultan, at the time serving as Yang di-Pertuan Agong, could not be prosecuted due to immunity that was accorded to rulers, while at the same time condemning Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s actions. Eventually, the matter passed without much further public attention. The brother of the caddy – who also suffered injuries during the incident, being distressed from what he saw, subsequently ran amok in Kuala Lumpur and had to be quarantined in a mental hospital.

===Gomez Incident===
====Assault====
In late 1992, two separate assault cases by the Sultan as well as his younger son, Tunku Abdul Majid Idris, on hockey coaches culminated in the stripping of immunity of rulers from prosecution. Both cases received considerable attention in the local and international news which was dubbed as &quot;The Gomez Incident&quot;. The incident was kicked off on 10 July 1992, when Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s second son, the Tunku Bendahara– Tunku Abdul Majid Idris, lost his temper during a hockey match with the Perak hockey team after Perak won the match by a penalty stroke, and assaulted the Perak goalkeeper, Mohamed Ja&#x27;afar Mohamed Vello. The goalkeeper later lodged a police report on 30 July. The incident received public attention, especially when the matter was debated in parliament. The incident resulted in the Malaysian Hockey Federation issuing Majid — then second-in line to the throne after his elder brother — a ban of five years from participating in any tournaments following investigations. Tunku Abdul Majid was later convicted of assault in January 1993, of which the chief justice sentenced him to a year in prison, on top of a RM 2,000 fine. He was released on a bail, and these charges were later dropped on grounds of immunity, which was still applicable at the time when the act was committed.

The Sultan responded to the ban by putting pressure on the state authorities to pull Johorean hockey teams from all national tournaments. In November 1992, Douglas Gomez, a coach for the Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar field hockey team, expressed his displeasure at being called to withdraw from a semi-final national hockey match by the Director of the Johor Education Department. The incident attracted the attention of the Sultan, who personally summoned Gomez to his palace, the Istana Bukit Serene, where he was promptly reprimanded and assaulted by the Sultan. Following Gomez&#x27;s meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment to his face and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan&#x27;s bodyguards and members of the Johor Military Force present were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was solely responsible for the injuries.

====Public responses and follow ups====
The assault resulted in a public outcry over the event which pressured all levels of the government up to the top ranks of the federal government to investigate into the matter. In the closing months of 1992, and also the opening months of 1993, dozens of articles mentioning misdeeds by the royal families of several states–but in particular Sultan Iskandar himself were published. A good deal of these alleged misdeeds that were mentioned included the charging of exorbitant fines–way above the prescribed legal limits–upon offenders who had obstructed the Sultan&#x27;s car, amongst others. Sultan Iskandar, bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.

The criticisms roused by the press prompted Members of Parliament of the Dewan Rakyat to convene a special session on 10 December 1992. All 96 parliamentarians present passed a unanimous resolution which called for action to curb the powers of the rulers if necessary. During the special meeting, parliamentarians disclosed past criminal records of Sultan Iskandar and his two sons, all of whom had been involved in a total of at least 23 cases of assault and manslaughter, five of which were committed by the Sultan after 1981, two by the Mahkota and three by the Bendahara.

A bill was passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara on 19 and 20 January 1993 respectively. The bill, which proposed to remove legal immunity was approved by six out of nine sultans—but saw stiff opposition from three, two of which included Sultan Ismail Petra of Kelantan and the Sultan Iskandar himself. Sultan Iskandar took up the initiative to obtain more royal support to stall the implementation of the proposed bill. The bill, which proposed to strip rulers and members of the royal families of legal immunity, would make them prosecutable by the law in any cases of proven criminal wrongdoings.

Sultan Iskandar organised a rally which was to be held outside the palace with the aim of garnering public support to stall the bill&#x27;s implementation. However, this was cancelled after intense pressure from the government. A report made during the rally quoted Sultan Iskandar calling upon all local civil servants to boycott state and federal functions in a show of support for his motion. Meanwhile, the federal government continued to pressure the rulers into assenting to the bills, which they did after several revisions of the bill were made by the government. Following which, the proposed bill was enshrined into the Federal Constitution in March 1993.

The bill allowed rulers who violated the laws to be prosecuted, while the Sedition Act of 1948 was also amended to allow public criticism of the rulers. A special court was created–presided by the Lord President of the Federal Court–to empower and prosecute members of the rulers and immediate members of the royal household.

====Aftermath====

Sultan Iskandar and his family members were not prosecuted for their past violations of the law on grounds that the royal immunity was still applicable when those incidents occurred. Nevertheless, shortly after the incident, Sultan Iskandar was prompted to take steps to rehabilitate his public image, which was more or less tarnished by the incident. In a public speech shortly after the episode, the Sultan was noted to have somewhat toned down his hardline image and appeared to be somewhat more humble, appealing to Johoreans to maintain their loyalty to him.

The Gomez incident also led to a review and proposal by the Federal Government in August 1993 to disband the Johor Military Forces (JMF). However, the bill to disband the JMF was subsequently repealed by parliament.

===Political===

====Yang di-Pertuan Agong (1980s)====
Shortly before his election as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong in 1983, a spate of reports alleging Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s intention to launch a coup d&#x27;état by launching a state of emergency to overthrow the government circulated within political circles, which reached Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad. The Sultan reportedly fostered close relations with several key military personnel, including the Army chief Jeneral Zain Hashim. The government subsequently took action to curb constitutional loopholes within the constitution and took to task of reducing the power of the royal veto in passing legislation, culminating in a constitutional crisis in late 1983. Nevertheless, during his inaugural speech as the Agong in 1984, about a month after the constitutional amendments were passed in parliament, Sultan Iskandar voiced public support for the revised constitution and pledged to act in accordance to the Prime Minister&#x27;s advise.

A diplomatic scandal between the United Kingdom and Malaysia broke out in 1984, when several British newspapers published pieces on Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s coronation, citing the headlines such as &quot;Killer becomes King&quot; and &quot;King a Killer&quot;, which enraged the Malaysian government, who demanded an apology from the British government. The British government refused to apologise on behalf of the newspapers, triggering tensions between the two countries. Two months later, in June 1984, Sultan Iskandar in his capacity as the Agong, surprised the Malaysian public when he publicly called upon Deputy Prime Minister, Musa Hitam, to make a public apology in front of the entire congregation present at the National Mosque. Sultan Iskandar, on his part, was angry over remarks which Musa made during the course of the 1983 constitutional crisis that he deemed to be disrespectful. Musa abided to the Agong&#x27;s demand and boldly came forward to make the apology, which was greeted by a thunderous applause from the entire congregation. The event, which was broadcast live throughout the nation on Malaysian Radio (although the television stations abruptly terminated its broadcast halfway), was seen by many observers as an act of confrontation by the Agong to put Musa in his place.

In 1988, also serving in his capacity as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong, the Lord President of the Federal Court Tun Salleh Abas was sacked by the Agong in what led to the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis. However, observers suggested a remarkably warm relationship between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and the Agong, both of whom shared common resentment towards the chief justice, Salleh Abas. In 1973, Iskandar was convicted of assault and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, to which Salleh Abas served as the public prosecutor hearing the case. As the public prosecutor, Salleh had appealed to the chief justice, Raja Azlan Shah, for handing down a heavier sentence for Iskandar, which earned his wrath. The sacking of the Lord President, was however not without controversy, given the alleged manner in which the Agong and Prime Minister had handled the matter–including an incident which the Agong had refused to forgive the Lord President in spite of Salleh&#x27;s willingness to offer his apology to the Agong, which he turned down.

====Later years (2000 onwards)====
Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s public call to support Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s administration in October 2006 created a minor stir among Mahathir&#x27;s supporters, when he remarked that &quot;Mahathir should act like a pensioner&quot;. The call came at a time when Mahathir&#x27;s spate of criticisms against Abdullah&#x27;s was at its most intense. The Sultan was the first state ruler to publicly defend the policy of the government during the period of Mahathir&#x27;s criticisms against the Abdullah administration. Earlier sources however, noted Sultan Iskandar&#x27;s concerns with the deepening rift between Mahathir and Abdullah and had asked to be photographed together with the two leaders during the United Malays National Organisations (UMNO) 60th anniversary celebrations in Johor Bahru.

A month later, in November 2006, another small stir erupted during the launching ceremony of the Iskandar Development Region, when Sultan Iskandar voiced his opinion that the Causeway, which connects Johor and Singapore, should be removed to allow ships to pass through to promote development of the state. He also remarked that the people should be wary of all foreigners as they were &quot;vultures&quot; and also urged the people not to hold them in high regard, citing his displeasure that his ancestors were &quot;deceived&quot; by dirty tactics employed by colonialists to build the Causeway.

At the inaugural 12th Johor State Assembly Seating in April 2008, a minor controversy erupted when one opposition state assemblyman (ADUN), Gwee Tong Hiang, flouted dress regulations by appearing in a lounge suit and tie instead of the usual official attire and songkok. This resulted in him being dismissed from the assembly chamber shortly before the Sultan&#x27;s arrival. Gwee, a Democratic Action Party (DAP) ADUN, reportedly argued that there was no stated order to wear the official attire and songkok and stated his desire to wear a western suit, promptly drew flak from other ADUNs and the Menteri Besar, Abdul Ghani Othman who had earlier on met to agree to don in the official attire and songkok prior to the assembly, whereby Gwee was absent. The Sultan, apparently angry at Gwee, sharply criticised him two days later and publicly called upon Gwee to seek an audience with him.

===Lifestyle===
During his time as the Agong, Sultan Iskandar was often seen in public carrying a pistol in his waistband, which drew considerable concern and discomfort from the Malaysian public due to his past record of criminal offences. He was also reputed to have led a flamboyant lifestyle, which also drew similar criticism. He was also known to be a motorbike enthusiast; documentaries on national patriotism would feature Sultan Iskandar, the then-Agong, riding out on a police motorbike and his flamboyant appearance during a few public ceremonies. These documentaries drew criticisms from the Malaysian public, who felt that the television clips of Sultan Iskandar were inappropriate for its theme and national image.

==Personal life==

In 1956, Mahmood married Josephine Ruby Trevorrow, from Cornwall, United Kingdom, with whom he had four children, including his successor, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor, King of Malaysia (as of 31 January 2024), and Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah. The marriage ended in divorce in 1962. He married again in 1961 – shortly before his divorce to Trevorrow, to Tengku Zanariah, who came from the Kelantan royal family. Tengku Zanariah had six children with the Sultan. Analysts such as Kate Wharton have observed that any literal references to Trevorrow&#x27;s association with Sultan Iskandar were carefully omitted in all official biographies.

As a youth, Mahmood qualified as a pilot, having trained in handling light and medium aircraft and helicopters. He was also apt in handling motorcycles, reportedly possessing the skills to strip a motorcycle down to its component parts and then reassemble it.

The Sultan is also well-known for his passion in many types of open-air sports, especially polo and golf. In his later years, he spent much of his free time at the Royal Johor Country Club. In addition, he also played tennis and squash on a regular basis. Within private circles, Sultan Iskandar was fondly known as &quot;Moody&quot;, a testimony to his first name &quot;Mahmud.&quot; His son, Abdul Majid, inherited his interest in amateur golf and once served as the President of the Malaysian Golf Association.

He kept a large collection of pets, particularly peacocks, at the Istana Bukit Serene compound, where he lived with the Sultanah. In his youth, Iskandar resided at the Istana Bukit Coombe, located at the top of Coombe Hill. It was built based on Dutch architectural designs, and was later renamed Istana Bukit Iskandar. The palace was later demolished in 1987, six years after Sultan Iskandar succeeded his late father as Sultan.

He made a personal friendship with Philippine opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. His son picked Aquino up at Changi airport and drove to Johor where he and Aquino had a meeting with the latter days before the former Philippine senator was assassinated.

==Issue==
Mahmood Iskandar had ten children, the elder four by his first wife Khalsom binti Abdullah and the younger six by his second wife Tengku Zanariah. 

==Health==

After undergoing a coronary bypass operation in the United States in 2000, close aides reported that Sultan Iskandar slowed down somewhat in his pace of life and took to playing golf only on an occasional basis. A bout of bronchitis in January 2008 saw the Sultan being briefly admitted and treated in a local hospital.

==Death==

Sultan Iskandar died on 22 January 2010 at 7:15 pm at the Puteri Specialist Hospital, Johor Bahru after being admitted earlier in the day following an illness at age 77. His death was officially announced at 11:20 pm by Menteri Besar of Johor Datuk Abdul Ghani Othman it was also announced that flags in Johor would be put at mast Johor starting from 6:00 am until 6:00 pm. He was brought to the Istana Besar, Johor Bahru for laying in state and was buried in the Mahmoodiah Royal Mausoleum the next day at 2:00 pm. Before that, the public was allowed to pay their last respects to Sultan Iskandar from early morning.

Among the royal family and other dignitaries present to give their last respects was the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong Mizan Zainal Abidin and Raja Permaisuri Agong Nur Zahirah, the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, the Raja of Perlis Sirajuddin, the Sultan of Pahang Ahmad Shah, the Sultan of Kedah Abdul Halim, the Sultan of Perak Azlan Shah, the Sultan of Selangor Sharafuddin, the Yang Dipertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan Muhriz, the Regent of Perlis Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail, the Tengku Mahkota of Pahang Abdullah, and the Tengku Mahkota of Kelantan Tengku Muhammad Faris Petra. Prime Minister Najib Razak, cut his visit to India short to attend his funeral. Also present were Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.

His son the Tunku Mahkota of Johor Ibrahim Ismail was proclaimed Sultan of Johor on 23 January.

==Ancestry==
Sultan Iskandar is a fourth generation descendant of Sultan Abu Bakar, who in turn was the son of Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, the Temenggong of Johor. In turn, some of Daeng Ibrahim&#x27;s patrilineal ancestors were also Temenggongs of Johor serving under their respective sultans. It is from this ancestral heritage that the name of his dynasty, the Temenggong dynasty, comes from. The Temenggong dynasty is also related to the prior ruling Bendahara dynasty as genealogical records show that Sultan Abdul Jalil IV was also a direct patrilineal ancestor of Sultan Iskandar.

<doc id="583341" wikidata="Q1149868" url="?curid=583341" title="Left fielder">
<text>In baseball, a left fielder, abbreviated LF, is an outfielder who plays defense in left field. Left field is the area of the outfield to the left of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher&#x27;s mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the left fielder is assigned the number seven.

==Position description==

Of all outfielders, the left fielder often will have the weakest arm, as he generally does not need to throw the ball as far to prevent the advance of any baserunners. The left fielder still requires good fielding and catching skills, and tends to receive more balls than the right fielder because right-handed hitters tend to &quot;pull&quot; the ball into left field. The left fielder also backs up third base on pick-off attempts from the catcher or pitcher and bunts, when possible. Moreover, when a runner is stealing third base, the left fielder must back up the throw from the catcher. Left fielders must also back up third base when a ball is thrown from right field, and back up center field when a pop fly is hit into the pocket.

<doc id="583344" wikidata="Q694636" url="?curid=583344" title="Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan">
<text>Tuanku Ja’afar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman (Jawi: ; 19 July 1922 – 27 December 2008) was Yang Di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan from 1967 until his death in 2008, and the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), from 1994 to 1999.

==Early life and education==
Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman was born on 19 July 1922 in Klang, Selangor to Tuanku Abdul Rahman ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhammad and his wife Che Engku Maimunah binti Abdullah and was raised in Seri Menanti, Negeri Sembilan. His mother was of mixed Irish and Anglo-Indian descent.

Growing up in an affectionate and considerate family had a profound impact on Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar&#x27;s character. He had a very close relationship with his siblings. He also emulated his father&#x27;s practice of visiting the local villagers and performing Friday prayers at Masjid Seri Menanti with his subjects. This childhood experience helped form Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar as an approachable and highly respected individual. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar received his primary education at the Seri Menanti Malay School. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar then continued his studies at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar (MCKK). Sports were a compulsory subject at MCKK. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was good at several sports and was made the captain of the cricket, tennis, squash, football and hockey teams. On top of that, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was also a skilled badminton and chess player. It was at MCKK that he became close with Abdul Razak Hussein, who would become the second Prime Minister of Malaysia.

In 1940, after graduating from MCKK, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar furthered his studies at Raffles College, Singapore. At the time, Raffles College was a popular higher education institution in Southeast Asia. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar had favoured sports over studies. As a keen tennis player, he would always play with Lee Kuan Yew, who became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar, who was supposed to complete the three-year programme, had to return to Malaya due to the start of World War II in December 1941.

==Early career==

===State Officer===

During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, he worked at the Seremban Land Office, Rembau and also Kuala Lumpur. Then, in the late 1940s, he was transferred to the Perak State Secretariat in Ipoh and was in charge of processing citizenship applications.

In 1946, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar started working in the Malay Administrative Service. Later in 1947, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was promoted to the position of Tax Assistant in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was then promoted as the District Officer in Tampin, Negeri Sembilan until 1955 and supported an anti-communist campaign. At this time he was also the Chairman of the Tampin District War Committee. At this time he decided that he wanted to further his studies in law.

He spent four years at University of Nottingham and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1947 before attending Balliol College, Oxford and the London School of Economics. This decision was driven by his interest in the subject of humanitarian, social and economic sciences. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was accompanied by Tuanku Najihah and their children. While at university, he continued playing cricket, football and badminton. He was also made captain of the tennis club and badminton.

Upon his return from the United Kingdom in 1952, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar held several posts in the civil service of the Malaysia including Assistant State Secretary of Perak, Assistant District Officer of Parit, Perak, and District Officer of Tampin.

===Diplomat===
Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar&#x27;s diplomatic career began in 1957. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was chosen to attend a one-year Diplomatic Service Course in London. While in London, the independence entourage led by Tunku Abdul Rahman arrived. Their purpose was to negotiate with the officers from the British Colonial Office at Lancaster House, London to obtain independence. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar assisted with the logistics, proposal papers and presentations. The entourage succeeded in achieving its goal when the British eventually consented to give independence to the Federation of Malaya. This news was greeted with great joy and an official ceremony was then held at the Dataran Merdeka, Kuala Lumpur on 31 August 1957. His first appointment was as Charge d&#x27; Affaires in Embassy of Malaysia, Washington, D.C., followed by First Secretary with the Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York, Consular and Deputy High Commissioner at the High Commission of Malaysia, London. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was later appointed as the Malaysian Ambassador to Egypt and then as High Commissioner to Nigeria and Ghana.

==42 years as the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan==
Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was to leave for Japan to serve as the Malaysian Ambassador to Japan but was recalled by the State Government of Negeri Sembilan in 1967 following the death of his half brother Tuanku Munawir who had been the Yang di-Pertuan Besar.

In line with the royal customs of Negeri Sembilan, before proceeding with the burial ceremony of Tuanku Munawir, a new ruler had to be selected to succeed the late Yang di-Pertuan Besar. As such the four Undang (Ruling Chiefs of Negeri Sembilan) conferred to choose the late Tuanku Munawir&#x27;s successor.

The selection of Tuanku Munawir&#x27;s successor had to be made from four eligible princes, or &quot;Putera Yang Empat&quot;, in order:

# Tunku Besar Seri Menanti, Tunku Muhriz ibni Almarhum Tuanku Munawir
# Tunku Laksamana, Tunku Nasir Alam ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhammad
# Tunku Muda Serting, Tunku Ja&#x27;afar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman
# Tunku Panglima Besar, Tunku Abdullah ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman

The &quot;Undang Yang Empat&quot; unanimously decided on Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar, who was 44 years old at the time, to accede to the throne as the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan. This proclamation was made by Dato&#x27; Undang Luak Jelebu, Dato&#x27; Abu Bakar bin Ma&#x27;amor, at Balairung Seri Istana Besar Seri Menanti. Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar ascended the throne as the 10th Ruler of Negeri Sembilan on 18 April 1967.

==10th Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia==

Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar was the tenth Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia from 26 April 1994 until 25 April 1999 succeeding Sultan Azlan Shah of Perak. On 26 April 1994, two months after he was chosen as the 10th Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar left the Istana Besar Seri Menanti, Negeri Sembilan, for the Istana Negara, Kuala Lumpur for the Installation Ceremony held at Balairung Seri Istana Negara. This auspicious event was witnessed by all Malay Rulers or their representatives. As the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar played a significant role in fostering ties between Malaysia and other countries.

Malaysia achieved many milestones while he was the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, among them Malaysia&#x27;s successful hosting of the 16th Commonwealth Games and APEC Summit, both in 1998. He also worked on Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Sepang, the Petronas Twin Towers, the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) and the new administrative capital of Putrajaya.

==Issue==

Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar married Tuanku Najihah binti Almarhum Tunku Besar Burhanuddin of Negeri Sembilan in 1942, who also served as his Raja Permaisuri Agong between 1994 and 1999. They had issue, 3 sons and 3 daughters:
* Tunku Dara of Negeri Sembilan, Tunku Tan Sri Naquiah (born on 26 December 1944)

*Tunku Panglima Besar Negeri Sembilan, Tunku Dato&#x27; Seri Nadzaruddin (born on 26 October 1959)

==Contributions==
During his reign as the ruler of Negeri Sembilan, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar focused his attention on the problems of the people and the administration of the state. In handling the socio-economic affairs of the state, Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar directed his attention to the industry and public housing sectors so as to improve the living standard of the people. As a result, several new housing areas were developed among which is Taman Tuanku Ja&#x27;afar which includes an industrial area and a golf course of international standard, Taman Tuanku Ampuan Najihah in Sungai Gadut and the Mambau housing project. The construction of these housing areas improved the people&#x27;s chances of owning their own property. This enabled them to enjoy a better standard of comfort. The expansion of the industrial sector paved way for more job opportunities for his subjects, thus improving their standard of living and also eradicating poverty amongst the people of Negeri Sembilan. He also endorsed the setting up of various recreational facilities to encourage families to spend time outdoors.

<doc id="583351" wikidata="Q3531909" url="?curid=583351" title="Ranjan Madugalle">
<text>Deshabandu Ranjan Senerath Madugalle (, ; born 22 April 1959) is a former Sri Lankan cricketer who currently serves as the Chief of the panel of ICC match referees. He was educated at Trinity College, Kandy, and Royal College, Colombo.

He represented Sri Lanka in international cricket between 1979 and 1988, making his debut in the 1979 ICC Trophy final against Canada. He had the honor of being in the first Sri Lankan Test team in 1982, and top-scored in the first innings with 65 – making a 99-run partnership with Arjuna Ranatunga. Madugalle represented Sri Lanka in 21 test matches and 63 One Day Internationals and also captained Sri Lanka national cricket team in two test matches and 13 ODIs.

Madugalle retired from international cricket in 1988 at the age of 29. Subsequently, he has become a match referee for the International Cricket Council in 1993 and currently serves as the chief of the panel of ICC match referees. He was promoted to the position of chief match referee of the ICC in 2001 in which he has achieved record longevity, but courted controversy at times by exhibiting bias against the India and Pakistan teams early in his career.

== ODI career ==
Madugalle continued as a vital part of the Sri Lankan Test and ODI team, only missing one international game between 1979 and 1984. However, his ODI performances worried the Sri Lankan selectors, with only one fifty from 25 innings. He was shuffled around the order in an attempt to gain some form, but after scoring a duck in the second and last ODI against New Zealand in 1984, he was dropped for the first three matches of the 1984–85 World Series Cup in Australia. A couple of seasons followed where he was in and out of the team, but a major reorganisation of the squad following the tour of India in 1986–87 gave him the chance again, and he seized it with a Test 60 against New Zealand.

== Performance outside Sri Lanka ==
Madugalle was never a good tourist, only averaging 21.50 with the bat abroad, while he averaged 42.76 on traditionally tricky Sri Lankan pitches. Indeed, his only century came in a home match – the first match of the 3-Test series against India in 1985. Madugalle took nearly seven hours to forge his 103, but it ensured in a drawn match. In the next match, he only batted once, making 54 from number three to build a solid platform for the next batsmen, which eventually led to a comfortable 149-run victory. They drew the third Test – despite scores of 5 and 10 from Madugalle, and Sri Lanka had won their first Test series.

==Performance as captain==
In 1988 he was appointed captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team, but his team troubled neither Australia, nor England under Madugalle&#x27;s leadership. Madugalle himself recorded four sub-20 scores as captain, and the two Tests he captained became his last. He also captained the ODI team in his last 13 matches, winning two and losing eleven, but again he failed to back up his captaincy with runs – only passing 25 twice. However, Sri Lanka did win in his very last match, with a five-wicket win over Pakistan in the 1988 Asia Cup – in which Madugalle did not bat.

He also played league cricket in England – particularly in 1979 for Flowery Field Cricket Club, who were then in the Saddleworth League.

==Retirement and match referee==
Madugalle only made two international fifties after the &#x27;85 India series, both in Tests, and eventually he retired to become a marketing executive in a multinational corporation. He became involved as a match referee in 1993. He progressed through the International Cricket Council ranks, refereeing over 750 international matches in 30 years. Thus, he officiated in many more international matches than he played. In 2001, he was appointed as the chief match referee by the ICC. In addition to being seen as an establishment man, his record in being impartial has been questioned by Asian fans - he was seen as harsh on the Indian and in particular Pakistani teams while being relatively light on Australian teams.

Madugalle set the record for becoming the most experienced match referee in ODIs, refereeing the 2019 World Cup Final, and in 2024 will referee his 400th, holding the record of 397 in January 2024. He holds the record for being a match referee in most ODIs.(304)

He also has the record for becoming the first match referee to officially take part in 100+ Tests. In fact, he&#x27;s the only match referee in test history to take part in 100 as well as 150 and 200 test matches. He still holds the record for being a match referee in most Test matches (214).

He also holds the record for being a match referee in most T20I matches at 142.

Madugalle has officially been a match referee in the most international cricket matches, with over 750 international matches.

In 2019, Ranjan Madugalle officiated as the match referee of the 2019 Cricket World Cup final.

Ranjan Madugalle, on 7 August 2024, became the first match referee to officiate in 400 men&#x27;s ODIs, reaching this landmark in the third and final ODI between Sri Lanka and India of the Indian cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2024 series.

==Controversies==
During his early tenure as a referee, Ranjan Madugalle courted controversy at times by exhibiting bias against Asian teams, the most notable incidents of which occurred during the Indian tour of Australia in 1999–2000.

<text>ARTISTdirect is an American online digital media entertainment company.

==Overview==
Founded in 1996, it owns several websites, including artistdirect.com and artistdirectinterviews.com. These websites are a group of affiliate websites offering multimedia content, music news and information, communities organized around shared music interests, music-related specialty commerce and digital music services.

Artistdirect began as an online music retailer and distribution company. It hosted the Ultimate Band List (UBL), a database with information on over 600,000 artists, concerts, record labels, and other music-related resources. In 1997, it partnered with the band Blink-182 to create Loserkids.com, an online store and community site for fans of the music and fashion of cutting-edge Alternative rock, punk, metal, and hard rock artists. It featured merchandise from various brands including Hurley, Dickies, and Ben Sherman. In the early 2000s Artistdirect combined the database of the Ultimate Band List and online store with free audio and video streams, music news, album reviews, and movie trailers.

In 2006, Artistdirect re-launched the UBL.com site to focus on independent and unsigned bands, and helping them to be &quot;discovered&quot;. According to Media Metrix, the Artistdirect Network averages 12.4 million unique hits.

In 2005 Artistdirect acquired MediaDefender, a company with a 90% share of the market for protecting against online copyright infringement.

In 2009, Artistdirect acquired MediaSentry, another company that focuses on battling online copyright infringement. The company will operate with two divisions, one for its copyright protection products, and another for its music-related web sites.

In August 2009, the company filed a &quot;Form 15&quot; with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, under which it will &quot;go dark&quot; and cease to make public its financial information. The company shares will also cease trading on the major stock exchanges.

In March 2015, the business of ARTISTdirect was acquired by PSI Capital, Inc.

==iMUSIC==
In August 2002, Marc Geiger launched his own iMUSIC label as a separate entity to ARTISTdirect Records but still under the Artistdirect umbrella. It also relied on BMG distribution and on Ted Field&#x27;s ADR marketing and promotion staff.

The basic idea of iMUSIC was to enter into label and distribution partnerships with long established artists (with sizable fan-bases) who no longer had major label deals.

== ARTISTdirect Online Music Awards ==
In 1999, they created the ARTISTdirect Online Music Awards. With 20 categories, the winners were selected by viewers via online. The first ever ceremony was held at House of Blues having performances of No Doubt, Cypress Hill and Chris Isaak among others. Madonna, Eminem, The Beatles and Ricky Martin were among the first winners. The following edition in 2000, had expanded their categories in rock, pop, urban/hip hop and electronica.
