<text>Philodendron is a large genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. , the Plants of the World Online accepted 621 species; other sources accept different numbers. Regardless of number of species, the genus is the second-largest member of the family Araceae, after genus &quot;Anthurium&quot;. Taxonomically, the genus &quot;Philodendron&quot; is still poorly known, with many undescribed species. Many are grown as ornamental and indoor plants. The name derives from the Greek words &quot;philo-&quot; &#x27;love, affection&#x27; and &quot;dendron&quot; &#x27;tree&#x27;. The generic name, &quot;Philodendron&quot;, is often used as the English name.

==Description==

===Growth habit===
Compared to other genera of the family Araceae, philodendrons have an extremely diverse array of growth methods. The habits of growth can be epiphytic, hemiepiphytic, or rarely terrestrial. Others can show a combination of these growth habits depending on the environment. Hemiepiphytic philodendrons can be classified into two types: primary and secondary hemiepiphytes. A primary hemiepiphytic philodendron starts life high up in the canopy where the seed initially sprouts. The plant then grows as an epiphyte. Once it has reached a sufficient size and age, it will begin producing aerial roots that grow toward the forest floor. Once they reach the forest floor, nutrients can be obtained directly from the soil. In this manner, the plant&#x27;s strategy is to obtain light early in its life at the expense of nutrients. Some primary epiphytic species have a symbiotic relationship with ants. In these species, the ants&#x27; nest is grown amongst the plant&#x27;s roots, which help keep the nest together. Philodendrons have extrafloral nectaries, glands that secrete nectar to attract the ants. The philodendron, in turn, obtains nutrients from the surrounding ant nest, and the aggressive nature of the ants serves to protect the plant from other insects which would eat it.

Secondary hemiepiphytes start life on the ground or on part of a tree trunk very close to the ground, where the seeds sprout. These philodendrons have their roots in the ground early in their lives. They then begin climbing up a tree and eventually may become completely epiphytic, doing away with their subterranean roots. Secondary hemiepiphytes do not always start their lives close to a tree. For these philodendrons, the plant will grow with long internodes along the ground until a tree is found. They find a suitable tree by growing towards darker areas, such as the dark shadow of a tree. This trait is called scototropism. After a tree has been found, the scototropic behavior stops and the philodendron switches to a phototropic growth habit and the internodes shorten and thicken. Usually, however, philodendrons germinate on trees.

A few species show three peaks in temperature during flowering, which stimulates beetles within the spathe and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to &quot;Philodendron&quot; and &quot;Monstera&quot;, as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the thermogenesis triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45Â° relative to the spathe may be to maximize the heat&#x27;s ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for thermogenesis. The part of the spadix that heats up is the sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during thermogenesis. The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation.

===Leaves===

The leaves are usually large and imposing, often lobed or deeply cut, and may be more or less pinnate. They can also be oval (&quot;Philodendron&quot; &#x27;White Princess&#x27;), spear-shaped, divided (&quot;Philodendron tripartitum&quot;) or in many other possible shape variations. The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. A quality of philodendrons is that they do not have a single type of leaf on the same plant. Instead, they have juvenile leaves and adult leaves, which can be drastically different from one another. The leaves of seedling philodendrons are usually heart-shaped early in the life of the plant. But after it has matured past the seedling stage, the leaves will acquire the typical juvenile leaf&#x27;s shape and size. Later in the philodendron&#x27;s life, it starts producing adult leaves, a process called metamorphosis. Most philodendrons go through metamorphosis gradually; there is no immediately distinct difference between juvenile and adult leaves. Aside from being typically much bigger than the juvenile leaves, the shape of adult leaves can be significantly different. In fact, considerable taxonomic difficulty has occurred in the past due to these differences, causing juvenile and adult plants to mistakenly be classified as different species.

The trigger for the transformation to adult leaves can vary considerably. One possible trigger is the height of the plant. Secondary hemiepiphytes start off on the dark forest floor and climb their way up a tree, displaying their juvenile type leaves along the way. Once they reach a sufficient height, they begin developing adult type leaves. The smaller juvenile leaves are used for the darker forest floor where light is in scarce supply, but once they reach a sufficient height in the canopy the light is bright enough that the bigger adult leaves can serve a useful purpose. Another possible trigger occurs in primary hemiepiphytes. These philodendrons typically send their aerial roots downward. Once their roots have reached the ground below, the plant will begin taking up nutrients from the soil, of which it had been previously deprived. As a result, the plant will quickly morph into its adult leaves and gain in size dramatically. Another quality of philodendrons leaves is they are often quite different in shape and size even between two plants of the same species. As a result of all these different possible leaf shapes, it is often difficult to differentiate natural variations from morphogenesis.

===Cataphylls===
Philodendrons also produce cataphylls, which are modified leaves that surround and protect the newly forming leaves. Cataphylls are usually green, leaf-like, and rigid while they are protecting the leaf. In some species, they can even be rather succulent. Once the leaf has been fully formed, the cataphyll usually remains attached where the stem and base of the leaf meet. In philodendrons, cataphylls typically fall into two categories: deciduous and persistent types. A deciduous cataphyll curls away from the leaf once it has formed, eventually turning brown and drying out, and finally falling off the plant, leaving a scar on the stem where it was attached. Deciduous cataphylls are typically found on vining philodendrons, whereas persistent cataphylls are typical of epiphytic philodendrons or appressed climbers. In the latter, the cataphylls are prevented from falling off in a timely manner due to the short internodes of the plant. The cataphylls will remain attached, drying out and becoming nothing more than fibers attached at the nodes. In some philodendrons, the cataphylls build up over time and eventually form a wet mass at the nodes. This may keep emerging roots moist and provide some form of lubrication to new leaves.

===Roots===
Philodendrons have both aerial and subterranean roots. The aerial roots occur in many shapes and sizes and originate from most of the plant&#x27;s nodes or occasionally from an internode. The size and number of aerial roots per node depends on the presence of a suitable substrate for the roots to attach themselves. Aerial roots serve two primary purposes. They allow the philodendron to attach itself to a tree or other plant, and they allow it to collect water and nutrients. As such, the roots are divided morphologically into these two categories. Aerial roots used for attaching to trees tend to be shorter, more numerous, and sometimes have a layer of root hairs attached; those used for collecting water and nutrients tend to be thicker and longer. These feeder roots tend to attach flush with the substrate to which the philodendron is attached, and make their way directly downwards in search of soil. In general, feeder roots tend to show both positive hydrotropic and negative heliotropic behaviors. Characteristic of roots in philodendrons is the presence of a sclerotic hypodermis, which are cylindrical tubes inside the epidermis that can be one to five cells long. The cells that line the sclerotic hypodermis are elongated and tend to be hardened. Underneath the epidermis is a unique layer of cells in a pattern of long cells followed by short cells.

===Extrafloral nectaries===
Some philodendrons have extrafloral nectaries (nectar-producing glands found outside of the flowers). The nectar attracts ants, with which the plant enjoys a protective symbiotic relationship. Nectaries can be found in a variety of locations on the plant, including the stalks, sheaths, lower surfaces of the leaves, and spathes. The nectaries produce a sweet, sticky substance the ants like to eat and which provides an incentive for them to build their nests amongst the roots of the given philodendron. In some cases, the amount of nectar produced can be quite extensive, resulting in the surface becoming entirely covered with it.

==Reproduction==

===Sexual===

When philodendrons are ready to reproduce, they will produce an inflorescence which consists of a leaf-like hood called a spathe within which is enclosed a tube-like structure called a spadix. Depending on the species, a single inflorescence can be produced or a cluster of up to 11 inflorescences can be produced at a single time on short peduncles. The spathe tends to be waxy and is usually bicolored. In some philodendrons, the color of the base of the spathe contrasts in color with the upper part, and in others, the inner and outer surfaces of the spathe differ in coloration. The paler color tends to be either white or green, and the darker usually red or crimson. Pelargonidin is the predominant pigment causing the red coloration in the spathes. The upper portion of the spathe is called the limb or blade, while the lower portion is called the convolute tube or chamber due to its tubular structure at the base. The spadix is more often than not white and shorter than the spathe. On the spadix are found fertile female, fertile male, and sterile male flowers. The fertile male and female flowers are separated on the spadix by a sterile zone or staminodal region composed of sterile male flowers. This barrier of sterile male flowers ensures fertile male flowers do not fertilize the female flowers. The arrangement tends to be vertical, with fertile male flowers at the top of the spadix followed by sterile male flowers, and fertile female flowers very close to the bottom in the region known as the spathe tube or chamber. In some philodendrons, an additional region of sterile male flowers is found at the very top of the spadix. The fertile female flowers are often not receptive to fertilization when the fertile males are producing pollen, which again prevents self-pollination. The pollen itself is thread-like and appears to project out from the region where the fertile male flowers are located.

Sexual reproduction is achieved by means of beetles, with many philodendron species requiring the presence of a specific beetle species to achieve pollination. The reverse is not always the case, as many beetle species will pollinate more than one philodendron species. These same beetles could also pollinate other genera outside of philodendron, as well as outside of the family Araceae. The pollinating beetles are males and members of the subfamily Rutelinae and Dynastinae, and to date the only beetles seen to pollinate the inflorescence are in the genera &quot;Cyclocephala&quot; or &quot;Erioscelis&quot;. Other smaller types of beetles in the genus&quot; Neelia&quot; visit the inflorescences, as well, but they are not believed to be involved in pollinating philodendrons. To attract the beetles, the sterile male flowers give off pheromones to attract the male beetles, usually at dusk. This process, female anthesis, is followed by male anthesis, in which the pollen is produced. Female anthesis typically lasts up to two days and includes the gradual opening of the spathe to allow the beetles to enter. Some evidence suggests the timing of opening of the spathe is dependent on light levels, where cloudy, darker days result in the spathe opening up earlier than on clear days. During female anthesis, the spadix will project forward at roughly 45Â° relative to the spathe.

Once female anthesis is nearing its end and the female flowers have been pollinated, the spathe will be fully open and male anthesis begins. In the beginning of male anthesis, the fertile male flowers complete the process of producing the pollen and the female flowers become unreceptive to further pollination. Additionally, the spadix moves from its 45Â° position and presses up flush to the spathe. Towards the end of male anthesis, the spathe begins to close from the bottom, working its way up and forcing the beetles to move up and across the upper region of the spathe, where the fertile male flowers are located. In doing so, the philodendron controls when the beetles come and when they leave and forces them to rub against the top of the spadix where the pollen is located as they exit, thus ensuring they are well-coated with pollen. One would expect the beetles to stay indefinitely if they could due to the very favorable conditions the inflorescence provides. After male anthesis, the males will go off and find another philodendron undergoing female anthesis, so will pollinate the female flowers with the pollen it had collected from its previous night of mating.

===Fruit===
Botanically, the fruit produced is a berry. The berries develop later in the season; berry development time varies from species to species from a few weeks to a year, although most philodendrons take a few months. The spathe will enlarge to hold the maturing berries. Once the fruit are mature, the spathe will begin to open again, but this time it will break off at the base and fall to the forest floor. Additionally, the berries are edible, although they contain calcium oxalate crystals, and have a taste akin to bananas. Many botanical sources will indicate that the berries are poisonous, probably due to the oxalate crystals. Many tropical plants contain oxalates in varying amounts. Sometimes proper preparation can render these harmless, and in many cases eating minor amounts causes most people no distress or minor gastric irritation. However, care should be taken to verify the toxicity of any particular species before ingesting these berries, particularly regularly or in large amounts.

The color of the berries can vary depending on the species, but most produce a white berry with slight tones of green. Some produce orange berries and others yellow berries, though. Still others will produce berries that start off white, but then change to another color with time. Philodendrons that produce orange berries tend to be members of the section &quot;Calostigma&quot;. Contained within the berries are the seeds which are extremely small compared to other members of the family Araceae. The berries often give off odors to attract animals to eat and disperse them. For example, &quot;Philodendron alliodorum&quot; berries are known to emit an odor similar to that of garlic. The animals that distribute the seeds depends on the species, but some possible dispersers include bats and monkeys. Insects also may be responsible for dispersing seeds, as beetles and wasps have been seen feeding on philodendron berries.

Eurytomid wasps also seek out philodendrons and are known to lay their eggs in the ovaries of many &quot;Philodendron&quot; species, resulting in galled inflorescences.

===Hybridization===
Philodendrons exhibit extremely few physical reproductive barriers to prevent hybridization, but very few natural hybrids are found in nature. This may be because philodendrons have many geographic and time barriers to prevent any such cross pollination. For example, it is rare for more than one philodendron species to be flowering at the same time or to be pollinated by the same species of beetles. The beetles have also been observed to be selective to the height of the plant they pollinate, which would serve as an additional preventive measure to make hybrids less likely. Because of these outside barriers, philodendrons may not have had to evolve physical mechanisms to prevent cross-pollination. Hybrids in nature are only rarely reported. When found, these hybrids often can show remarkable genetic relationships. Crosses between two philodendrons in different sections can occur successfully.

==Taxonomy==

===History===
Philodendrons are known to have been collected from the wild as early as 1644 by Georg Marcgraf, but the first partly successful scientific attempt to collect and classify the genus was done by Charles Plumier. Plumier collected approximately six species from the islands of Martinique, Hispaniola, and St. Thomas. Since then, many exploration attempts have been made to collect new species by others. These include those by N.J. Jacquin who collected new species in the West Indies, Colombia, and Venezuela. At this time in history, the names of the philodendrons they were discovering were being published with the genus name &quot;Arum&quot;, since most aroids were considered to belong to this same genus. The genus &quot;Philodendron&quot; had not yet been created. Throughout the late 17th, 18th century, and early 19th centuries, many plants were removed from the genus&quot; Arum&quot; and placed into newly created genera in an attempt to improve the classification. Heinrich Wilhelm Schott addressed the problem of providing improved taxonomy and created the genus &quot;Philodendron&quot; and described it in 1829. The genus was first spelled as &#x27;Philodendrum&#x27;, but in 1832, Schott published a system for classifying plants in the family Araceae titled &quot;Meletemata Botanica&quot; in which he provided a method of classifying philodendrons based on flowering characteristics. In 1856, Schott published a revision of his previous work titled &quot;Synopsis aroidearum&quot;, and then published his final work &quot;Prodromus Systematis Aroidearum&quot; in 1860, in which he provided even more details about the classification of &quot;Philodendron&quot; and described 135 species.

===Modern classification===

Philodendron are usually extremely distinctive and not usually confused with other genera, although a few exceptions in the genera &quot;Anthurium&quot; and &quot;Homalomena&quot; resemble &quot;Philodendron&quot;.

The genus Philodendron has been subdivided into three subgenera: &quot;Meconostigma&quot;, &quot;Pteromischum&quot;, and &quot;Philodendron&quot;. In 2018, it was proposed that &quot;Philodendron&quot; subg. &quot;Meconostigma&quot; be recognized as a separate genus, &quot;Thaumatophyllum&quot;.

The genus &quot;Philodendron&quot; can also be subdivided into several sections and subsections. Section &quot;Baursia&quot;, section &quot;Philopsammos&quot;, section &quot;Philodendron&quot; (subsections &quot;Achyropodium&quot;, &quot;Canniphyllium&quot;, &quot;Macrolonchium&quot;, &quot;Philodendron&quot;, &quot;Platypodium&quot;, &quot;Psoropodium&quot; and &quot;Solenosterigma&quot;), section &quot;Calostigma&quot; (subsections &quot;Bulaoana&quot;, &quot;Eucardium, Glossophyllum&quot;, &quot;Macrobelium&quot; and &quot;Oligocarpidium&quot;), section &quot;Tritomophyllum&quot;, section &quot;Schizophyllum&quot;, section &quot;Polytomium&quot;, section &quot;Macrogynium&quot; and section &quot;Camptogynium&quot;.

Typically, the inflorescence is of great importance in determining the species of a given philodendron, since it tends to be less variable than the leaves. The genus &quot;Philodendron&quot; could be classified further by means of differentiating them based on the pattern of thermogenesis observed, although this is not currently used.

==Evolution==
&quot;Philodendron&quot; diverged from &quot;Adelonema&quot; and diversified during the late Oligocene, 25 million years ago, in the New World.

==Distribution and habitat==
Philodendron species can be found in many diverse habitats in the tropical Americas and the West Indies. Most occur in humid tropical forests, but can also be found in swamps and on river banks, roadsides and rock outcrops. They are also found throughout the diverse range of elevations from sea level to over 2000 m above sea level. Species of this genus are often found clambering over other plants, or climbing the trunks of trees with the aid of aerial roots. Philodendrons usually distinguish themselves in their environment by their large numbers compared to other plants, making them a highly noticeable component of the ecosystems in which they are found. They are found in great numbers in road clearings.

Philodendrons can also be found in Australia, some Pacific islands, Africa and Asia, although they are not indigenous and were introduced or accidentally escaped.

==Ecology==
The leaves of philodendrons are also known to be eaten by Venezuelan red howler monkeys, making up 3.1% of all the leaves they eat.

The resins produced during the flowering of &quot;Monstera&quot; and &quot;Philodendron&quot; are known to be used by &quot;Trigona&quot; bees in the construction of their nests.

The spathe provides a safe breeding area for beetles. As such, male beetles are often followed there by female beetles. The philodendrons benefit from this symbiotic relationship because the males will eventually leave the spathe covered in pollen and repeat the process at another philodendron, pollinating it in the process. Females that see a male beetle headed for a philodendron flower know he does so with intention of mating, and females which are sexually receptive and need to mate know that they can find males if they follow the pheromones produced by the philodendron flowers. As a result, the male beetles benefit from this relationship with the philodendrons because they do not have to produce pheromones to attract females. Additionally, male beetles benefit because they are ensured of mating with only sexually receptive females. Pheromones produced by the philodendrons may be similar to those produced by female beetles when they wish to attract males to mate. Also, the pheromones have a sweet, fruity smell in many species and no noticeable smell for others. Additionally, the beetles consume pollen from the fertile male flowers throughout the night, in addition to the sterile male flowers which are rich in lipids.

Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the spathe throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the spathe opening up for the beetles. This process is known as thermogenesis. By the time the spathe is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46Â Â°C in some species, but usually around 35Â Â°C. The thermogenesis coincides with the arrival of the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20Â Â°C higher than the outside ambient temperature. The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases.

As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. The beetles may use scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation, accounting for the two types of paths the beetles follow.
==Cultivation==

===Growing===
Philodendrons can be grown outdoors in mild climates in shady spots. They thrive in moist soils with high organic matter. In milder climates, they can be grown in pots of soil or in the case of &quot;Philodendron oxycardium&quot; in containers of water. Indoor plants thrive at temperatures between 15 and 18Â Â°C and can survive at lower light levels than other house plants. Although philodendrons can survive in dark places, they much prefer bright lights. Wiping the leaves off with water will remove any dust and insects. Plants in pots with good root systems will benefit from a weak fertilizer solution every other week.

===Propagation===
New plants can be grown by taking stem cuttings with at least two joints. Cuttings then can be rooted in pots of sand and peat moss mixtures. These pots are placed in greenhouses with bottom heat of 21â24Â Â°C. During the rooting, cuttings should be kept out of direct sunlight. Once rooted, the plants can be transplanted to larger pots or directly outside in milder climates. Stem cuttings, particularly from trailing varieties, can be rooted in water. In four to five weeks, the plant should develop roots and can be transferred to pots. Philodendrons can also propagate through air layering which is a more advanced method of propagation that involves creating a new plant on the stem of an existing plant.

Hybridizing philodendrons is quite easy if flowering plants are available, because they have very few barriers to prevent hybridization. However, some aspects of making crosses can make philodendron hybridization more difficult. Philodendrons often flower at different times and the time when the spathe opens up varies from plant to plant. The pollen and the inflorescence both have short lives, which means a large collection of philodendrons is necessary if crossbreeding is to be done successfully. The pollen life can be extended to a few weeks by storing it in film canisters in a refrigerator. Artificial pollination is usually achieved by first mixing the pollen with water. A window is then cut into the spathe and the water-pollen mixture is rubbed on the fertile female flowers. The entire spathe is then covered in a plastic bag so the waterâpollen mixture does not dry out; the bag is removed a few days later. If the inflorescence has not been fertilized, it will fall off, usually within a few weeks.

== Toxicity ==
Philodendrons can contain as much as 0.7% of oxalates in the form of calcium oxalate crystals as raphides. The risk of death, if even possible, is extremely low if ingested by an average adult, although its consumption is generally considered unhealthy. In general, the calcium oxalate crystals have a very mild effect on humans, and large quantities have to be consumed for symptoms to even appear. Possible symptoms include increased salivation, a sensation of burning of the mouth, swelling of the tongue, stomatitis, dysphagia, an inability to speak, and edema. Cases of mild dermatitis due to contact with the leaves have also been reported, with symptoms including vesiculation and erythema. The chemical derivatives of alkenyl resorcinol are believed to be responsible for the dermatitis in some people. Contact with philodendron oils or fluids with the eyes have also been known to result in conjunctivitis. Fatal poisonings are extremely rare; one case of an infant eating small quantities of a philodendron resulting in hospitalization and death has been reported. This one case study, however, was found to be inconsistent with the findings from a second study. In this study, 127 cases of children ingesting philodendrons were studied, and they found only one child showed symptoms; a 10-month-old had minor upper lip swelling when he chewed on a philodendron leaf. The study also found the symptoms could subside without treatment and that previously reported cases of severe complications were exaggerated.

In a 1961 study, 72 cases of cat poisonings were examined, of which 37 resulted in the death of the cat. The symptoms of the poisoned cats included excitability, spasms, seizures, kidney failure, and encephalitis. In a 1978 study, three cats (two adults and one kitten) were tube-fed a purÃ©ed leaf and water mixture of &quot;P.Â cordatum&quot;, then euthanized. A necropsy showed no signs or symptoms of acute poisoning or toxicity. Dosages of 2.8, 5.6, and 9.1 g/kg were used, the highest dose being much more than a house cat could consume. Earlier epidemiological studies (which did not necessarily invoke a purÃ©e-and-water feeding method) were suggested to be wrong based on the premise that many of the sick cats in those studies may have had conditions and merely consumed philodendrons in an attempt to alleviate their illnesses.

Some philodendrons are known to be toxic to mice and rats. In one study, 100Â mg of &quot;P.Â cordatum&quot; leaves suspended in distilled water were fed to six mice. Three of the mice died. The same experiment was done with 100Â mg of &quot;P.Â cordatum&quot; stems on three mice and none of them died. Leaves and flowers of &quot;P.Â sagittifolium&quot; were also orally administered in 100-mg doses to the mice. Three mice were used for each of the leaves and flowers; none of the mice died. A similar experiment was done on rats with the leaves and stems of &quot;P.Â cordatum&quot;, but instead of oral administration of the dose, it was injected intraperitoneally using 3Â g of plant extract from either the leaves or stems. Six rats were injected with the leaf extract and five of them died. Eight rats were injected with the stem extract and two of them died.

==Uses==
Indigenous people from South America use the resin from bees&#x27; nests (made from the species) to make their blowguns air- and watertight.

Though they contain calcium oxalate crystals, the berries of some species are eaten by the locals. For example, the sweet white berries of &quot;Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum&quot; are known to be used. Additionally, the aerial roots are also used for rope in this particular species.

Also, in the making of a particular recipe for curare by the Amazonian Taiwanos, the leaves and stems of an unknown philodendron species are used. The leaves and stems are mixed with the bark of &quot;Vochysia ferruginea&quot; and with some parts of a species in the genus &quot;Strychnos&quot;.

Yet another use of philodendrons is for catching fish. A tribe in the Colombian Amazon is known to use &quot;P.Â craspedodromum&quot; to add poison to the water, temporarily stunning the fish, which rise up to the surface, where they can be easily scooped up. To add the poison to the water, the leaves are cut into pieces and tied together to form bundles, which are allowed to ferment for a few days. The bundles are crushed and added to the water into which the poison will dissipate. Although the toxicity of &quot;P.Â craspedodromum&quot; is not fully known, active ingredients in the poisoning of the fish possibly are coumarins formed during the fermentation process.

Some philodendrons are also used for ceremonial purposes. Among the Kubeo tribe, native to Colombia, &quot;P.Â insigne&quot; is used by witch doctors to assuage ill patients. They use the juice of the spathe to stain their hands red, since many such tribes view the color red as a sign of power.

<doc id="576204" wikidata="Q610103" url="?curid=576204" title="Cousins (1989 film)">
<text>Cousins is a 1989 American romantic comedy film directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Ted Danson, Isabella Rossellini, Sean Young, William Petersen, Keith Coogan, Lloyd Bridges and Norma Aleandro. The film is an American remake of the 1975 French comedy &quot;Cousin Cousine&quot;, directed by Jean-Charles Tacchella. It is set in Seattle, Washington, but shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

== Plot ==
Larry Kozinski and Maria Hardy meet at the wedding of Larry&#x27;s uncle Phil and Maria&#x27;s widowed mother Edie. The newly-made cousins-by-marriage begin talking before realizing both their spouses, Tish and Tom, are missing. Tish and boorish Tom finally appear, claiming Tom, an auto salesman, was showing Tish a car and it broke down. Tom, a serial cheater, breaks off all his illicit relationships, then visits Tish, a make-up consultant, wanting to sleep with her again, though she brushes him off. Shortly after the wedding, Phil suddenly dies during a large family gathering. Phil&#x27;s brother, Vince, arrives for the funeral. He offers to buy Phil&#x27;s business from Edie, whom he is immediately attracted to.

A few weeks later, Maria meets with Larry to discuss Tish and Tom&#x27;s affair. Larry initially acts nonchalant, then explodes in anger. When Maria arrives home, she tells Tom she had lunch with Larry, knowing it will upset him. Maria and Larry continue to meet, but commit to just being friends. They arrange to &quot;accidentally&quot; run into each other at a restaurant. Their spouses, Maria&#x27;s mother, Edie, and Larry&#x27;s dad, Vince, and son, Mitch are present. Everyone ends up sitting together. Tish abruptly leaves the table after seeing Larry and Maria flirtatiously gazing at each other. Maria follows Tish into the bathroom and sweetly explains that she and Larry were only playing a game to get back at her and Tom. She says it went too far and apologizes. Tish is touched by Maria&#x27;s kindness.

Over time, Larry and Maria realize they are falling in love, and, one afternoon, they finally consummate their affair. Maria returns home late, and Tom obviously knows where she was. She confronts him about his infidelities and admits she loves Larry. Tom then calls Larry&#x27;s house and threatens him. Larry&#x27;s father, Vince, who was sleeping, answers the phone, and believes it is his brother, Phil calling from beyond the grave to warn him away from Edie. Larry returns from his day with Maria to discover that Tish is leaving; she wishes him well and they part amicably. Tish and Tom meet up at a hotel, but Tish notices Tom&#x27;s changed behavior, but realizes he only wants temporary affairs, storms out.

Maria learns that her young daughter, Chloe has been instigating fights at school as a way of acting out. Maria ends her affair with Larry, saying she needs to devote herself to Chloe and her marriage.

Vince urges Larry to do what makes him happy, while he tells Edie that he loves her. At Vince and Edie&#x27;s wedding, Larry sees Maria and asks her to dance, then to spend the rest of her life with him. Tom, overhearing this, angrily threatens to leave her. Maria chooses to be with Larry. In an epilogue, Larry and Maria are seen sailing away with their children, living a dream they both shared.

== Production ==
The film was directed by Joel Schumacher, known mostly for his works &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; and &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. Although not identified as such, the locations were primarily shot around Vancouver, Canada, among the first times the city was featured so prominently, and led to the city being used as a film location much more. The score was composed by Angelo Badalamenti, who was extremely popular at the time from his work with &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; director David Lynch. &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; described Badalamenti&#x27;s melodic score as a definite asset to the film, underscoring several scenes with comical, Henry Mancini-like cues, and others with a delicate, poignant theme that blossoms into a waltz over the end credits.

== Reception ==
The film has received mixed reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 56% of 9 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6 out of 10. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;Aâ&quot; on scale of A+ to F. The film received two thumbs up from Siskel &amp; Ebert, who were the only major critics to respond enthusiastically to the film upon its theatrical release. The film grossed a total of US$22 million, with an opening weekend of $3.5 million.

Individuals were praised as wellâparticularly Rossellini, whom critics found able to create a sweet, affectionate role after appearing in David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. Other comments called the film &quot;underrated&quot; and &quot;while not amongst the great movie romances, there is something undeniably touchingâand dare I say heart-warmingâabout &quot;Cousins&quot;&quot;.

<text>Hiding Out is a 1987 American romantic thriller comedy-drama film starring Jon Cryer as a state&#x27;s witness who disguises himself as a high school student in order to avoid being killed by the mob.

==Plot==
Andrew Morenski and two others, all stockbrokers, have passed bogus bonds for a mobster awaiting trial. After an evening out at a bar, one of them is killed in his home. The next morning, the FBI take the other two into protective custody.

Convincing his FBI bodyguards to have breakfast out of the safe house, Andrew and the agents are followed by hitmen. One of the bodyguards is killed in the diner, the other injured, and Andrew flees the scene. While running from the hitmen, he boards a train, temporarily escaping. Andrew hitchhikes with a truck driver to Topsail, Delaware, where he phones his Aunt Lucy, who tells him to meet her at the high school where she is the nurse.

Shaving his beard and bleaching the sides of his hair blonde give Andrew a punk look. He trades his $500 Italian sports coat for a peacoat from a bum to complete the look. Arriving at Topsail High School, the office personnel mistake him for a new student and register him for classes. He takes the name of Maxwell Hauser (off a Maxwell House coffee can).

Andrew&#x27;s cousin does not recognize him at first. He eventually pulls him aside, revealing himself. He also sleeps at Patrick&#x27;s, unbeknownst to his aunt.

Not willing to take the teachers&#x27; attitudes, Andrew becomes a hero to those tired of the school&#x27;s status quo. This upsets Kevin O&#x27;Roarke, the current class president, and captures the heart of Ryan Campbell. During an afternoon at the local diner, he accidentally drops a birthday card meant for his grandmother (who had raised him) and it gets mailed. Later, a hitman posing as an FBI agent contacts his grandmother and sees the card and its postmark, telling him where Andrew is hiding.

One night, back from a date with Ryan, Patrick stops Andrew from entering the house. FBI agents have arrived, knowing he is close because he used his ATM card. Patrick takes his mother&#x27;s keys and Andrew ends up using the high school as his refuge. He meets the school janitor, Ezzard, and shares a drink with him, revealing who he is. Andrew embraces the opportunity to run for class president, not knowing the election committee has already decided to rig the results in favor of Kevin.

Bored with high school, and realising he is the last witness against the mobster, Andrew decides to drop out. During the presentation of class election results, Kevin is announced the winner. However, he demands a recount, which reveals that most want Andrew as class president. As Andrew starts to address the crowd, a hitman begins firing at the stage. Ezzard, watching the proceedings, manages to dispose of one of the hitmen, while the other moves up into the rafters of the gym. Andrew chases him and Patrick uses a spotlight to blind the hitman, who loses his grip and falls to the gym floor below.

Images of graduation are spliced into images of Andrew taking the stand in court against the mobster for whom he had sold the bogus bonds. After his testimony, Andrew is given a few minutes to say farewell to his grandmother before being placed in the Witness Protection Program.

The last scene is of Ryan, sitting under a tree at a university. Andrew, now known as Eddie Collins, appears from behind the tree and tells her he has decided to become a teacher.

==Soundtrack==
Four songs from the film&#x27;s soundtrack entered the record charts in the United States: &quot;Crying&quot; by Roy Orbison (re-recorded as a duet with k.d. lang); &quot;Live My Life&quot; by Boy George; &quot;Catch Me (I&#x27;m Falling)&quot; by Pretty Poison, which went top ten in the US and also topped the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in September 1987; and the top-20 U.S. hit &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot; by Scarlett and Black. The UK hit &quot;Seattle&quot; by Public Image Ltd. was also recorded in 1987 and featured in the film.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert compared the film to &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot;, also released in 1987, in that it was an &quot;example of the newest Hollywood genre, the Generation Squeeze, in which plots artificially combine adult and teenage elements&quot; in order to attract the latter to the movie theater while attracting enough of an adult audience for the success of the rental market. Ebert describes as &quot;dumb&quot; the main plot device involving the gangsters&#x27; continuing pursuit of Andrew, and the story arc about the janitor he befriends, and notes that the film fails to depict how the 29-year-old protagonist could have much in common with Gish&#x27;s character, who is more than 10 years younger than he is. He credited the film with getting him to wonder what it would be like to revisit one&#x27;s high school years, but cites &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; from 1986 as a film that had portrayed that scenario much more successfully.

Janet Maslin called the film &quot;pleasant enough&quot; with &quot;mild&quot; jokes that &quot;revolve around things such as Mr. Cryer&#x27;s accidentally giving tax advice to the father of a teenage girl he&#x27;s dating, or his feeling out of place at the roller rink.&quot; She thought the film&#x27;s conclusion suggested that Cryer &quot;could have unexpected charm in more adult roles.&quot;

The &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; called the film &quot;predictable, slackly plotted nonsense, marginally redeemed by a genial young cast.&quot;

<text>Gunnar A. SjÃ¶gren (&quot;GAS&quot;; 1920â1996) was a Swedish engineer who worked for Saab Automobile and the author of &quot;The SAAB Way - the first 35 years of Saab cars, 1949â1984&quot;.

== Biography ==

Born in Stockholm in 1920, he spent his youth in the northern Swedish city of UmeÃ¥. During this period he developed a passion for drawing cars, trains aeroplanes and boats. It was soon to become focused on cars, and remained such throughout his life. 

After leaving high school, he spent a year in an engineering workshop manufacturing trolleybuses, whereafter he went to engineering college in Ãrebro in order to realise his dream of fully understanding cars and entering into the auto industry. The most notable event during his education was an essay written at high school entitled &quot;About cars and car makes&quot; that would have gained the maximum mark had it not been for his error of spelling &quot;Orient&quot; with a small &quot;o&quot;.

On December 1, 1941, he was taken on at General Motors in Stockholm as a draughtsman, after having submitted his drawings along with an employment application. He was later transferred to the advertising department where he produced illustrations for the variety of GM products marketed in Sweden.

In his spare time, he started submitting drawings to auto magazines and soon became a regular contributor to &quot;Motor&quot; in Sweden. He also was appointed editor of &quot;GM-Revyn&quot;, the company&#x27;s customer magazine, thanks to his talent for both writing and illustrating. It was at this time, the fall of 1946 that he bought his first car, a Chevrolet Fleetmaster Sport Sedan (model 2103), model year 1946. Color: grey.

After 13 years he left GM and became a freelancer with commissions from advertising agencies and magazines. After five years of the irregular hours of a self-employed person, he decided to return to industry. He had his eyes set on one particular firm: Saab. As luck would have it Saab advertised for an illustrator and Gunnar SjÃ¶gren moved down to Saab&#x27;s headquarters in LinkÃ¶ping in the fall of 1959.

==Association with Saab==
He remained loyal to Saab ever since, moving to wherever the passenger car business had its headquarters: first to SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje and finally to its present location in NykÃ¶ping, just 60 miles south of Stockholm.

At Saab, SjÃ¶gren became deeply involved both in the shaping of the advertising material used to sell the cars as well as in the design and color scheme advisory groups.

Over the years SjÃ¶gren assembled a wealth of material about the Saab car, its design philosophy and the marketing strategies followed in bringing the cars to the eyes of the car buying public. In doing so he became owner of a vast fund of knowledge of the cars for which he became a key figure behind the scenes.

His knowledge about cars was legendary and, without hesitation he could correctly sketch with unfailing accuracy most of the important cars of the last 40 or 50 years - particularly if they happened to be made by Saab or General Motors.

==Other interests==
But despite this abiding and seemingly all-consuming interest in cars, Gunnar SjÃ¶gren developed a profound and expert interest in many other fields. He was a nature lover who made it a habit to learn the Latin names of plants and flora and fauna that came his way - all of which he could depict in characteristic line drawings with great accuracy. He painted nature scenes and even dared to do so in oils. Since 1975 he was also a true philatelist who mounted his collection artistically and with informative explanations on sheets of his own design. Other indoor interests that served as a background to his major pursuit were classical music, with a strong penchant towards the Vienna school, smoking a pipe or a cigar and enjoying a glass of good wine or Scotch whisky. His dislikes included sports, entertainment programmes on TV and popular music. At 60, SjÃ¶gren decided to retire from Saab, but still devoted some of his time to Saab matters - such as writing the book &quot;The Saab Way&quot; - so even though he now could devote all the time he wanted to his other hobbies, he still seemed to have gasoline in his blood.

<text>The Bay of Islands is an extensive inlet located on the west coast of the island of Newfoundland, in Canada. It is a sub-basin of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, consisting of many inlets such as Humber Arm and Goose Arm.

The Bay of Islands is bordered on the north and south by North Arm Hills and Blow Me Down mountains, which are part of the Humber Arm Allochthon, which also include the Lewis Hills and the Tablelands. The largest island in the bay is Woods Island (which was formerly inhabited), which is surrounded in most directions by the Long Range Mountains and is directly north of the Lewis Hills.

The Way Office was established on July 1, 1883. The first Waymaster was Thomas Carter.

Flowing into the Bay of Islands is the Humber River. Draining Deer Lake, the Humber is one of the major rivers on the island of Newfoundland, making the Bay of Islands an important estuary. Near the mouth of the Humber River, appropriately named &quot;Humber Mouth&quot;, is the city of Corner Brook (2011 pop.: 19,886), as well as several neighboring suburbs. The Humber River was used for many years to float logs down to the Bay of Islands where a large Bowater pulp and paper mill at Corner Brook turned them into paper products. Today this mill is owned by Kruger Inc and its logs are transported by truck. Although the river is mainly used for recreational purposes, the bay still sees active shipping to and from Corner Brook&#x27;s port.

Other towns along the shores of the Bay of Islands are mostly dependent upon the fishing industry. These communities include (on the southern shore of Humber Arm, the southernmost bay) Mt Moriah, Humber Arm South, Lark Harbour, and York Harbour, (on the northern shore of Humber Arm) Hughes Brook, Irishtown-Summerside, Meadows, Gillams, McIvers, and (on Middle Arm, north of Humber Arm) Cox&#x27;s Cove. There are still fish plants in Cox&#x27;s Cove, Humber Arm South, and Curling. Curling was once an incorporated community but is now amalgamated with Corner Brook.

<text>Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead is a 1991 American coming-of-age black comedy film directed by Stephen Herek, written by Neil Landau and Tara Ison, and starring Christina Applegate, Joanna Cassidy, Keith Coogan, John Getz, and Josh Charles. The plot focuses on a 17-year-old girl who assumes the role as head of the house when the elderly babysitter whom her mother had hired to watch over her kids while she is in Australia suddenly dies.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; was released in theaters on June 7, 1991, and grossed $25.1 million. Despite receiving generally negative reviews from critics upon release, it developed a reputation as a cult film following its release on VHS and cable television.

A remake was released in the United States on April 12, 2024.

==Plot==
Sue Ellen &quot;Swell&quot; Crandell is a 17-year-old Los Angeles high school graduate who cannot afford to accompany her friends to Europe for the summer. When her divorced mother leaves for an Australian vacation with her boyfriend, Swell looks forward to a summer of freedom with her siblings Kenny, Zach, Melissa, and Walter. Much to the kids&#x27; dismay, their mother hires a live-in babysitter named Mrs. Sturak, a seemingly sweet elderly woman who assures Mrs. Crandell that she can take care of all five children.

As soon as Mrs. Crandell leaves, Mrs. Sturak shows her true colors as a tyrant, quickly drawing the ire of the children. However, she soon has bad reactions to the shockingly-raunchy posters and hideous furnishings in Kenny&#x27;s room. After Swell discovers Mrs. Sturak having died in her sleep in a chair, the kids worry that their summer of freedom will be cut short if they notify the authorities. They resolve to stuff Mrs. Sturak&#x27;s body in a trunk, dropping it off at a local mortuary with a note that reads &quot;Nice Old Lady Inside, Died of Natural Causes&quot;. But much to their horror, the kids discover that the spending money given by their mother to Mrs. Sturak was with the body when they dropped it off at the mortuary.

In order to make ends meet, Swell gets a job at a fast-food restaurant called Clown Dog. She makes an impression on her co-worker Bryan, but ends up quitting due to their obnoxious manager Mr. Egg. Swell then forges an extensive rÃ©sumÃ© under the guise of a Vassar-educated young fashion designer and applies at General Apparel West (GAW), hoping to secure a job as a receptionist. Impressed by her rÃ©sumÃ©, the company&#x27;s senior vice president of operations Rose Lindsey hires Swell on the spot as an executive assistant much to the chagrin of Carolyn, a snooty receptionist who was initially in line for the job.

The inexperienced Swell must balance the adult responsibilities of her work life while still trying to enjoy herself as a teenager. In order to support the family, she obtains the keys to her mother&#x27;s own Volvo and begins stealing from petty cash at GAW, intending to return it when she receives her paycheck. She also begins a relationship with Bryan which becomes strained when she learns he is Carolyn&#x27;s brother. After an argument about Swell&#x27;s double life, she and Bryan angrily part ways.

Resentful of Swell&#x27;s promotion, Carolyn schemes with her co-worker Bruce to discredit Swell. Swell must also rebuff the unwelcome advances of Gus Brandon, the philandering vice president of marketing who happens to be dating Rose. Swell is furious when she discovers that her siblings have stolen from the petty cash funds in her purse to buy extravagant gifts including a state-of-the-art home-entertainment center.

When Swell learns that GAW is in danger of going out of business, she takes it upon herself to create a new clothing line with Rose suggesting they hold a fashion show to exhibit their new designs. With no petty cash left to rent a banquet hall, Swell offers to host the party, convincing her siblings to help clean the house, beautify the yard and act as caterers. During the party, Rose dumps Gus when Swell exposes his philandering. As she&#x27;s planning to finally oust Swell, Carolyn presents Rose with a copy of Swell&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license to prove she is only a teenager. However, Rose deems Carolyn&#x27;s efforts as petty jealousy and rebukes her. The party manages to be a success with fashion buyers impressed by Swell&#x27;s designs worn by Swell&#x27;s friends.

The event abruptly falls apart when Bryan drives up to the house, hoping to reconcile with Swell. When he emerges from the truck, he is confused to see Carolyn there. At that same moment, Mrs. Crandell arrives home early, forcing Swell to confess her lie in front of everyone. Rose forgives Swell for her deception because buyers were enthusiastic about the show, ensuring the future of the company. Carolyn and Bruce find their car vandalized by Kenny&#x27;s friends. Rose offers Swell a job as her personal assistant, but she declines because she is considering college. After Swell apologizes to Bryan, they make up and kiss. Mrs. Crandell then inquires about Mrs. Sturak.

During the credits, two mortuary workers look over Mrs. Sturak&#x27;s gravestone at the cemetery and plan to use the money found on her to visit Las Vegas. The gravestone reads: &quot;Nice Old Lady - Died of Natural Causes&quot;.

==Production==
According to writers Neil Landau and Tara Ison, the core idea for the film originated in the mid-1980s. Landau was inspired by the 1983 film &quot;Risky Business&quot;, in which a high-school protagonist is thrust into the adult world and manages to hold his own. The first draft, titled &quot;The Real World&quot;, was finished in 1987 and sold to 20th Century Fox, but was shelved. Fox wanted a film with a lighter theme than that of the script written by Landau and Ison and envisioned &quot;an actor like Winona Ryder in the starring role&quot;. Landau was uneasy with the hiring of Stephen Herek, then known for &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, to direct the film.

In 1989, the film was picked up by Outlaw Productions, which attracted Christina Applegate to the project through her &quot;Married... with Children&quot; costar Ed O&#x27;Neill. Joanna Cassidy was cast as Rose Lindsey after a suggestion by Landau. The film was one of David Duchovny&#x27;s early roles before he achieved mainstream success, but casting director Sharon Bialy had trouble convincing the studio to hire him. Jennifer Love Hewitt was originally cast as Melissa, but had to back out because Disney Channel would not release her from a television show in which she had been starring.

After the production ended, the studio was forced to change &quot;The Real World&quot; title because of a conflict with MTV&#x27;s new television series of the same name, and settled on &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot;. Landau was initially unimpressed with the revised title but accepted it after seeing Johnny Carson make a pun about it.

==Release==
Warner Bros. released &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; on June 7, 1991, in 1,802 theaters. The film remained in exhibition for 29 weeks in the United States.

===Home media===
The film achieved commercial success on VHS and in HBO airings; reportedly, $1Â million was spent on video-store advertisements. HBO Home Entertainment released the film on VHS and Betamax in the spring of 1992. HBO later released it on DVD in 2001. , the film is available for digital purchase via Amazon Prime.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; earned $4.2Â million during its opening weekend in the United States, ranking number six at the U.S. box office. The film had a total U.S. and Canada gross of $25,196,249, making a small profit but below the filmmakers&#x27; expectations.

Several reviewers compared the film unfavorably to the then-recent hit &quot;Home Alone.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated: &quot;Blame the smash of &#x27;Home Alone&#x27; for the new herd of kids-on-the-loose movies. Let&#x27;s hope none are dumber than this one. ... There&#x27;s no telling how the unflatteringly photographed Applegate delivers a comic line on the big screen, because [screenwriters] Tara Ison and Neil Landau haven&#x27;t written her any,&quot; and concluded by calling the movie &quot;the film equivalent of processed cheese.&quot;

Kathleen Maher of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; described the film as &quot;&quot;Home Alone&quot; meets &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot; and then visits &quot;Working Girl&quot;&quot;. Roger Ebert was slightly more positive, awarding the film 2 out of 4 stars and calling it &quot;a consumerist, escapist fantasy for teenage girls&quot;. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;isn&#x27;t quite as dead as you might expect&quot; but that &quot;it doesn&#x27;t exactly pulsate with originality&quot;. He ended by complimenting the &quot;subversive elements&quot; that distinguished its otherwise &quot;familiar, pre-sold air&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; said despite the film&#x27;s &quot;preposterous storyline&quot; that stretches credulity and a script that &quot;might have been sharper, wittier and cleverer, [it] nevertheless achieves on its own level by genuinely involving its young target audience&quot; and becomes &quot;surprisingly entertaining and fun&quot;.

Critics in the UK were more positive, with &quot;Empire&quot; calling it &quot;amusing fluff&quot;, and &quot;Time Out&quot; writing, &quot;This is a sassy little comedy of wit and intelligence from the director of &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. As Swell, Applegate is appealing and resourceful, while Coogan&#x27;s dope-head Kenny contributes to a wonderfully dry, on-going marital spoof. Getz is the unctuous boardroom chauvinist to a tee, and Cassidy rounds off the picture&#x27;s relaxed Cosmo-feminism as Swell&#x27;s scatty boss.&quot; Tim Pullein of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;The latter strand of the story, with broad but engaging satire on office politics and the assorted kidologies of the workplace, gathers a fair head of comic steam.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Gilded by personable performances, particularly from [Christina Applegate and Josh Charles], this wish-fulfilling fantasy manages to be wholeheartedly ridiculous in a manner that leaves criticism disarmed.&quot;
===Legacy===
Despite the critical response on release, the film went on to achieve a cult following on VHS and television.

Applegate suggested the reasons for the film&#x27;s continued resonance with audiences is its message about second chances. She commented &quot;[Sue Ellen] was kind of pissed off, she was not doing great in school, not participating in her family so much; she was relatable to a lot of teenagers who feel like the burden of the world is on them. They&#x27;re so dramatic about everything and I think in her success, there&#x27;s hope. When I&#x27;ve seen it now as an adult, that&#x27;s what I see: It&#x27;s a feel-good movie. Everyone gets a second chance, everyone gets the chance to turn themselves around and all kids want to feel that way. They don&#x27;t want to feel stuck in what they are. These characters give kids hope and I think that&#x27;s thematically what you walk away from it believing and sensing and seeing.&quot;

The film was mentioned by name in the first episode of the WB animated series &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. In the episode &quot;De-Zanitized&quot;, the fictional Chairman of the board of Warner Bros., Thaddeus Plotz, says that he has not been this upset since they made &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Mom the Babysitter&#x27;s Dead&quot; to Dr. Scratchansniff, when he chooses him to get the Warner siblings under control.

==Remake==

In June 2010, reports surfaced that a remake of the film would be produced by The Mark Gordon Company. Eventually, a remake would be produced by Tyra Banks and her company SMiZE Productions, for release on April 12, 2024. It was produced with the streaming service BET+, directed by Wade Allain-Marcus and starred Simone Joy Jones, Nicole Richie and June Squibb. Joanna Cassidy, Keith Coogan, and Danielle Harris make cameos in the film.

<doc id="576225" wikidata="Q1778154" url="?curid=576225" title="Law officers of the Crown">
<text>The law officers are the senior legal advisors to His Majesty&#x27;s Government of the United Kingdom and devolved governments of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are variously referred to as the Attorney General, Solicitor General, Lord Advocate, or Advocate General depending on seniority and geography â though other terms are also in use, such as the Counsel General for Wales. Law officers in these roles are distinguished by being political appointees, while also being bound by the duties of independence, justice and confidentiality among the other typical professional commitments of lawyers. These roles do not have any direct oversight of prosecutions nor do they directly lead or influence criminal investigations. This is a distinguishing factor between law officers and the state attorneys general of the United States or US Attorney General.

Each Crown Dependency has its own law officers to the Crown.

Each British Overseas Territory, apart from the British Indian Ocean Territory, also has its own Attorney General. Many Commonwealth countries or those with a history of British colonisation retain these titles, though their particular roles and responsibilities may differ from the roles in the United Kingdom. 

There are eight Law Offices in the United Kingdom, though not all serve the Westminster Government. The role of Attorney General for England and Wales and Advocate General for Northern Ireland has been held by the Lord Hermer since 5 July 2024. He is supported by the Solicitor General for England and Wales. The Scottish Government has two law officers, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, with the Lord Advocate being the most senior law officer in Scotland and is the chief legal adviser to the Scottish Government. Following devolution, a new position of Advocate General for Scotland was created to advise the UK Government on matters of Scots law. The office of the Advocate General for Scotland should not be confused with that of &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, which is the term used for the Lord Advocate in Scottish criminal proceedings as the head of the systems of prosecution in Scotland. The Welsh Government has its own law officer: the Counsel General for Wales; as does the Northern Irish executive: the Attorney General for Northern Ireland. 

The two Attorneys General for the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall are non-political appointments. They are not typically being referred to when the term &quot;law officer&quot; is used, as this tends to be reserved for political appointees.

==Law officers of the United Kingdom==

===England===
The Attorney General for England and Wales, a member of the UK Government, is similarly the chief law officer of the Crown in England and Wales and advises and represents the Crown and government departments in court. By convention, and unlike the papers of other ministers, this legal advice is available to subsequent governments. In the second half of the 20th century it became unusual for the Attorney General to be formally a member of the Cabinet. Rather he/she would attend only when the Cabinet required legal advice.

The Attorney General oversees the small Attorney General&#x27;s Office and also has responsibility for the Government Legal Department, which is headed by the Treasury Solicitor. In practice, the Treasury Solicitor (who also has the title of Procurator General) normally provides the lawyers or briefs Treasury Counsel to appear in court, although the Attorney General may appear in person. The person appointed to this role provides legal advice to the Government, acts as the representative of the public interest and resolves issues between government departments. The Government Legal Department provides advice to government departments, instructing independent counsel where necessary. The Attorney General is a barrister and can appear in court in person, though in practice he/she rarely does so, and then only in cases of outstanding national importance. In those cases the Government Legal Department provides his back-up. When appearing in court in person he/she is addressed by the judge as &quot;Mr. Attorney&quot;.

The Attorney General also has supervisory powers over prosecutions, including those mounted by the Crown Prosecution Service, headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions; the Serious Fraud Office; and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office. While the Attorney General is not personally involved with prosecutions, some prosecutions (e.g. rioting) cannot be commenced without their consent, and they generally have the power to halt prosecutions. Criminal prosecutions are the responsibility of the Crown Prosecution Service, headed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Attorney General may appeal cases to the higher courts where, although the particular case is settled, there may be a point of law of public importance at issue.

The Attorney General has public interest functions, being, for example, the trustee of default where a sole trustee has died, and can also take cases to the Supreme Court where points of general legal importance need to be settled.

The Attorney General&#x27;s deputy is the Solicitor General for England and Wales, held by Lucy Rigby, since 2 December 2024. Under the Law Officers Act 1997, the Solicitor General may do anything on behalf of, or in the place of, the Attorney General, and vice versa.

===Northern Ireland===
Since the prorogation of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972, the Attorney General for England and Wales was also Attorney General for Northern Ireland. The separate office of Attorney General for Northern Ireland was re-created alongside the new office of Advocate General for Northern Ireland upon the devolution of policing and justice powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 12 April 2010. As a result, these functions were split between:

* The Advocate General for Northern Ireland, who is the chief legal adviser to the UK Government on Northern Ireland law. The post is held by the Attorney General for England and Wales by virtue of office. 
* The Attorney General for Northern Ireland, who is the chief legal adviser to the Northern Ireland Executive. John Larkin QC was appointed to that position on 24 May 2010 by the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, held by Brenda King, since 18 August 2020.

===Scotland===
 

Under the 1999 constitutional reforms brought about by the Scotland Act 1998, the Lord Advocate has become the most senior law officer of the Scottish Government, acting as the chief legal adviser, as well as ultimately being responsible for the functioning of Scots law with all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland being conducted in the name of the Lord Advocate. The Lord Advocate does not attend Scottish cabinet meetings, however, they do see all cabinet papers and may be required to, along with the Solicitor General, attend cabinet meetings where the topic of discussion is relating to a matter of which the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General is responsible for, such as a specific legal aspect or the operations, functioning and funding of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. Although not a member of the Scottish cabinet, the Lord Advocate is a member of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Legislation, and contributes to the drafting, delivery and implementation of parliamentary bills and subsequent laws by way of attending Ministerial Bill Management Meetings. and The office holder of the post of Lord Advocate is the chief legal adviser to the Scottish Government and the crown in Scotland. 

The Lord Advocate is not head of the Faculty of Advocates; that position is held by the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates. The position of Lord Advocate is the most senior of the two Scottish law officers, and the Lord Advocate is a member of the Scottish Government. The Lord Advocate serves as the head of the criminal prosecution system and has sole responsibility for the investigation of deaths within Scotland. Additionally, the Lord Advocate is the sole, principal legal adviser to the Scottish Government and acts as the representative of the Scottish Government within civil proceedings and hearings. They have the power to refer a bill of the Scottish Parliament to the Supreme Court within the four week timeframe period to allow the Supreme Court to determine whether any aspect of a Scottish parliamentary bill or any associated provisions of a bill are outâwith the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, should it be disputed by any member of either the Scottish Parliament, UK Parliament or any other Scottish or UK politician.

The Lord Advocate, held by Dorothy Bain, since 22 June 2021, heads the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and is the chief public prosecutor in Scotland. It is not within the powers of the Scottish Parliament to remove the incumbent Lord Advocate from their post as head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths. Like other law officers elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the Lord Advocate has a statutory duty in ensuring that all bills passed by the Scottish Parliament are within its legislative competence. The Lord Advocate has specific duties granted under the Scotland Act 1998 which allows them to investigate and resolve legal questions and concerns about the devolved powers of both the Scottish ministers and the Scottish Parliament.

The Lord Advocate is assisted by the Solicitor General for Scotland, held by Ruth Charteris, since 22 June 2021. The Solicitor General is the deputy to the Lord Advocate, and act as an assistant to the Lord Advocate undertaking their functions. As with the Lord Advocate, the Solicitor General is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the incumbent First Minister of Scotland. As well as supporting the Lord Advocate in the delivery of the Lord Advocate&#x27;s functions, the Solicitor General may also exert their statutory and common law powers, where necessary. Both the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland are independent from the Scottish Government and its ministers in connection to criminal prosecutions and death investigations within Scotland. The duty to act independently on matters from both the Scottish Government and Scottish ministers is recognised in Section 48(5) of the Scotland Act 1998.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom Government is advised on Scots law by the Advocate General for Scotland, and from 1707 to 1998, the Lord Advocate was the chief legal adviser of the British Government and the Crown on Scottish legal matters, both civil and criminal, until the Scotland Act 1998 devolved most domestic affairs to the Scottish Parliament. Since the reâestablishment of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government in 1999, there has been a reduced role of the British Government in Scots law. The office of Advocate to the monarch is an ancient one, preâdating the Treaty of Union 1707 and existed in the preâunion Kingdom of Scotland. The first recorded Lord Advocate was Sir John Ross of Montgrenan, who is formally mentioned in 1483. At this time the post was generally called the King&#x27;s Advocate and only in the year 1573 was the term &quot;Lord Advocate&quot; first used.

===Wales===

Under the Government of Wales Act 2006, the Counsel General for Wales is the chief legal adviser to, and a member of, the Welsh Government.

==Non-political attorneys general==
Some subjects are entitled to have an attorney general: these include a queen consort and the Prince of Wales, who has an Attorney General for the Duchy of Cornwall. There is also an Attorney-General of the Duchy of Lancaster, which is a mostly landed inheritance that is held by the Crown (in trust for the monarch) and administered independently of the monarch under the supervision of a government minister, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

==Defunct legal offices==
Before the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the legal advisers to the Crown in the Courts of Ireland were the Attorney-General for Ireland and the Solicitor-General for Ireland. These offices became redundant in 1921.

The Crown also had a legal adviser for the High Court of Admiralty, known as the Admiralty Advocate, but this office lapsed in 1875 when the Admiralty Court became part of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice.

The Crown&#x27;s representative in the ecclesiastical courts of England was the King&#x27;s Advocate (or Queen&#x27;s Advocate when the monarch was female). This office has been vacant since the resignation of its last holder in 1872.

Though not defunct, the Judge-Advocate General was ranked among the law officers until the beginning of the 19th century.

<text>The Web Experimental Psychology Lab is a website for participating in Web-based experiments, a method used in experimental psychology. The Web Experimental Psychology Lab was founded in 1994-1995, by Ulf-Dietrich Reips at the University of TÃ¼bingen, then moved to the University of ZÃ¼rich and on to the Universidad de Deusto, and is now at the University of Konstanz. For the first time, participants were able to take part in studies via a web browser in a virtual psychology laboratory.

In January 2017 the Society for Computation in Psychology named Reips&#x27; 2001 article on the Web Experimental Psychology Lab in the journal Behavior Research Methods one of eight &quot;groundbreaking and influential&quot; articles in the history of the society and the field.

<doc id="576228" wikidata="Q374024" url="?curid=576228" title="Nikolai Luzin">
<text>Nikolai Nikolayevich Luzin (also spelled Lusin; ; 9 December 1883 â 28 February 1950) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician known for his work in descriptive set theory and aspects of mathematical analysis with strong connections to point-set topology. He was the eponym of Luzitania, a loose group of young Moscow mathematicians of the first half of the 1920s. They adopted his set-theoretic orientation, and went on to apply it in other areas of mathematics.

==Life==
He started studying mathematics in 1901 at Moscow State University, where his advisor was Dmitri Egorov. He graduated in 1905.

Luzin underwent great personal turmoil in the years 1905 and 1906, when his materialistic worldview had collapsed and he found himself close to suicide. In 1906 he wrote to Pavel Florensky, a former fellow mathematics student who was now studying theology: &quot;You found me a mere child at the University, knowing nothing. I don&#x27;t know how it happened, but I cannot be satisfied any more with analytic functions and Taylor series ... it happened about a year ago. ... To see the misery of people, to see the torment of life, to wend my way home from a mathematical meeting ... where, shivering in the cold, some women stand waiting in vain for dinner purchased with horror - this is an unbearable sight. It is unbearable, having seen this, to calmly study (in fact to enjoy) science. After that I could not study only mathematics, and I wanted to transfer to the medical school.&quot; The correspondence between the two men continued for many years and Luzin was greatly influenced by Florensky&#x27;s religious treatise &quot;The Pillar and Foundation of Truth&quot; (1908).

From 1910 to 1914 Luzin studied at GÃ¶ttingen, where he was influenced by Edmund Landau. He then returned to Moscow and received his Ph.D. degree in 1915. During the Russian Civil War (1918â1920) Luzin left Moscow for the &quot;Polytechnical Institute Ivanovo-Voznesensk&quot; (now called Ivanovo State University of Chemistry and Technology). He returned to Moscow in 1920.

In the 1920s Luzin organized a famous research seminar at Moscow State University. His doctoral students included some of the most famous Soviet mathematicians: Pavel Alexandrov, Nina Bari, Aleksandr Khinchin, Andrey Kolmogorov, Aleksandr Kronrod, Mikhail Lavrentyev, Alexey Lyapunov, Lazar Lyusternik, Pyotr Novikov, Lev Schnirelmann and Pavel Urysohn.

On 5 January 1927 Luzin was elected as a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union and became a full member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union first at the Department of Philosophy and then at the Department of Pure Mathematics (12 January 1929). In 1929 he was elected as a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in KrakÃ³w.

==Research work==
Luzin&#x27;s first significant result was a construction of an almost everywhere divergent trigonometric series with monotonic convergence to zero coefficients (1912). This example disproved the Pierre Fatou conjecture and was unexpected to most mathematicians at that time.

At approximately the same time, he proved what is now called Lusin&#x27;s theorem in real analysis.

His Ph.D. thesis titled &quot;Integral and trigonometric series&quot; (1915) had a large impact on the subsequent development of the metric theory of functions. A set of problems formulated in this thesis for a long time attracted attention from mathematicians. For example, the first problem in the list, on the convergence of the Fourier series for a square-integrable function, came to be called Luzin&#x27;s conjecture and was solved by Lennart Carleson in 1966 (Carleson&#x27;s theorem).

In the theory of boundary properties of analytic functions he proved an important result on the invariance of sets of boundary points under conformal mappings (1919).

Luzin was one of the founders of descriptive set theory. Together with his student Mikhail Suslin, he developed the theory of analytic sets.

He also made contributions to complex analysis, the theory of differential equations, and numerical methods.

===Letter to Vygodsky===
In a letter to M. Ya. Vygodsky dating from 1932, Luzin expresses sympathy with Vygodsky&#x27;s infinitesimal approach to developing calculus. He mocks accusations of bourgeois decadence against Vygodsky&#x27;s textbook, and relates his own youthful experience with what he felt were unnecessary formal complications of the traditional development of analysis. Typical is his youthful reaction to his teachers&#x27; insistence that the derivative is a limit: &quot;They won&#x27;t fool me: it&#x27;s simply the ratio of infinitesimals, nothing else.&quot; A recent study notes that Luzin&#x27;s letter contained remarkable anticipations of modern calculus with infinitesimals.

==Luzin affair of 1936==
On 21 November 1930, the declaration of the &quot;initiative group&quot; of the Moscow Mathematical Society which consisted of Luzin&#x27;s former students Lazar Lyusternik and Lev Schnirelmann along with Alexander Gelfond and Lev Pontryagin claimed that âthere appeared active counter-revolutionaries among mathematiciansâ. Some of these mathematicians were pointed out, including the advisor of Luzin, Dmitri Egorov. In September 1930, Egorov was arrested on the basis of his religious beliefs. He then left the position of director of the Moscow Mathematical Society and was replaced by Ernst Kolman. As a result, Luzin left the Moscow Mathematical Society and Moscow State University. Egorov died on 10 September 1931, after a hunger strike initiated in prison. In 1931, Kolman brought the first complaint against Luzin.

In 1936 the Great Purge began. Millions of people were arrested or executed, including leading members of the intelligentsia. In JulyâAugust of that year, Luzin was criticized in &quot;Pravda&quot; in a series of anonymous articles whose authorship later was attributed to Kolman. It was alleged that Luzin published âwould-be scientific papersâ, âfelt no shame in declaring the discoveries of his students to be his own achievementsâ, and stood close to the ideology of the âblack hundredsâ, orthodoxy, and monarchy âfascist-type modernized but slightly.â One of the complaints was that he published his major results in foreign journals.

The article triggered a special hearing on Luzin&#x27;s case by the Commission of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, where the allegations were reviewed and formalized. At the hearing, Alexandrov, Lyusternik, Khinchin, Kolmogorov and some other students of Luzin accused him of plagiarism from Pyotr Novikov and Mikhail Suslin and various forms of misconduct, which included denying promotions to Kolmogorov and Khinchin. According to some researchers, Alexandrov and Kolmogorov had been involved in a homosexual relationship in the 1930s, a fact the police used to pressure them into testifying against their former teacher. Sergei Sobolev, Gleb Krzhizhanovsky and Otto Schmidt incriminated Luzin with charges of disloyalty to Soviet power. The methods of political insinuations and slander had been used against the old Muscovite professorship already several years before the article in &quot;Pravda&quot;.

The hearings were completed in five sessions between July 7, 1936, and July 15, 1936, and people testifying, as well as the nature of accusations, changed from one session to another. In the initial session, the accusations were separated into accusations of scientific misconduct, which included plagiarism; accusations of professional misconduct, which mostly involved accusations of nepotism in promotions and reviews; and political accusations, which were the most serious. The initial review on July 7, which most prominently featured Alexandrov and Kolmogorov, concluded in a warning to Luzin regarding plagiarism while stressing the overall importance of his work, cleared him politically, yet recommended to relieve him of administrative duties.

However, this outcome did not seem to satisfy the instigators of the case, so that from the second hearing on, the nature of accusations shifted: now the primary focus was the fact that Luzin published his papers extensively in France rather than in Soviet journals, and his pre-Soviet sympathies were brought to the forefront.

The special hearing of the Commission of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union endorsed all accusations of Luzin as an &quot;enemy under the mask of a Soviet citizen.&quot; Although the Commission convicted Luzin, he was neither expelled from the academy nor arrested, but his department in the Steklov Institute was closed and he lost all his official positions. There has been some speculation about why his punishment was so much milder than that of most other people condemned at that time, but the reason for this does not seem to be known for certain. Historian of mathematics Adolph P. Yushkevich speculated that at the time, Stalin was more concerned with the forthcoming Moscow trials of Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev and others, whereas the eventual fate of Luzin was of a little interest to him.

The 1936 decision of the Academy of Sciences was not canceled after Stalin&#x27;s death. The decision was finally reversed on January 17, 2012.

<text>Patrolling is a military tactic. Small groups or individual units are deployed from a larger formation to achieve a specific objective and then return. The tactic of patrolling may be applied to ground troops, armored units, naval units, and combat aircraft. The duration of a patrol will vary from a few hours to several weeks depending on the nature of the objective and the type of units involved.

There are several different types of patrol each with a different objective. The most common is to collect information by carrying out a reconnaissance patrol. Such a patrol may try to remain clandestine and observe an enemy without themselves being detected. Other reconnaissance patrols are overt, especially those that interact with the civilian population.

==Patrol types==

A combat patrol is a group with sufficient size (usually platoon or company) and resources to raid or ambush a specific enemy. It primarily differs from an attack in that the aim is not to &quot;hold ground&quot;.

A clearing patrol is a brief patrol around a newly occupied defensive position in order to ensure that the immediate area is secure. Clearing patrols are often undertaken on the occupation of a location, and during stand to in the transition from night to day routine and vice versa.

A standing patrol is a static patrol, probably known as an OP/LP(Observation Post/Listening post) in US and NATO terminology. Standing patrols are usually small (half section/section) static patrols intended to provide early warning, security or to guard some geographical feature, such as dead ground.

A reconnaissance (recce) patrol is a patrol, usually small whose main mission is the gathering of information. Generally speaking recce patrols tend to avoid contact, although it is not unknown for recon patrols to &quot;fight for information&quot;.

A screening patrol combines a number of patrols to &#x27;screen&#x27; a large area. This type of patrol is used by armored formations in desert theaters, and also by ground troops operating in urban areas. A screen is generally composed of a number of static observation posts.

<text>Kazik Na Å»ywo (&quot;Kazik Live&quot;, also known as KNÅ» and KaenÅ¼et) was a Polish rapcore band formed in 1991, in Warsaw.

==History==
Their first performance was during the music festival in Sopot, Poland, in 1992. Staszewski then shocked the audience, singing the song &quot;100Â 000Â 000&quot;, which was based on Lech WaÅÄsa&#x27;s presidential campaign unfulfilled promise that all Poles would be given 100Â million zÅoty. In chorus, Staszewski repeats: &quot;WaÅÄsa, give me my 100Â million, WaÅÄsa, give us our 100Â million&quot;.

After the recording of &quot;Na Å¼ywo, ale w studio&quot; in 1994, JabÅoÅski was replaced by Tomasz Goehs. A few months later the guitarist Robert &quot;Litza&quot; Friedrich was added. After quitting the band, Robert Friedrich was replaced by Olaf Deriglasoff.

The band gave the last concert on 25 January 2004 in GdaÅsk. Following a long break, the band announced its return. First concerts are scheduled for mid and late February 2009 in ToruÅ and WrocÅaw, with the lineup Staszewski (vocals), BurzyÅski (guitar), Kwiatkowski (bass guitar), Friedrich (guitar) and Goehs (drums).

In 1994 and 1995 he founded the Web Experimental Psychology Lab, the first laboratory for conducting real experiments on the World Wide Web. In 1997, he was one of the seven founders of the German Society for Online Research (DGOF) and wrote a book chapter on the methodology of conducting experiments via the internet that later won him a young scientist award by the German Society for Psychology. His 2002 article in the journal Experimental Psychology, &quot;Standards for Internet-based experimenting&quot;, defined the field and became the journal&#x27;s most cited article. In 2005, Reips was elected the first non-North American president of the Society for Computers in Psychology (SCiP).

Reips is the founding editor of the International Journal of Internet Science, currently serving (jointly with Uwe Matzat).

==Awards==
Reips and his Web services have received awards from the Methods Division of the German Psychological Society (young scientist award, 1997), Oxford University (&quot;key player in the social shaping of e-science and e-social science&quot;), University of Colorado Boulder, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, , &quot;Planet Science&quot;, Bild der Wissenschaft, New Scientist, The British Academy, , IBM, the American Psychological Society, and others. In January 2017 the Society for Computers in Psychology named the 2001 paper &quot;Reips, U.-D. (2001). The Web Experimental Psychology Lab: Five years of data collection on the Internet. Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers, 33, 201-211.&quot; one of eight &quot;groundbreaking and influential&quot; articles in the history of the society and the field.

In 1996 Reips won in the First Internet Literature competition in Germany, co-organized by the German weekly and IBM with his digital poem &quot;Das Websonett&quot;, a digital media variation and &quot;sonetto di risposta&quot; on A.W. Schlegel&#x27;s &quot;Das Sonett&quot;. Literature theorist Erika Greber described the Websonett as &quot;literarisch anspruchsvoll&quot; (literarily sophisticated) and featured a special printable version Reips created on the last page of her compendium on poetological metaphorism and literature theory. Reips later created a technically updated version, even though all versions remain fully functional in modern web browsers.

<doc id="576241" wikidata="Q1807003" url="?curid=576241" title="Lord Advocate">
<text>His Majesty&#x27;s Advocate, known as the Lord Advocate (), is the principal legal adviser of both the Scottish Government and the Crown in Scotland for civil and criminal matters that fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament. The Lord Advocate provides legal advice to the government on its responsibilities, policies, legislation and advising on the legal implications of any proposals brought forward by the government. The Lord Advocate is responsible for all legal advice which is given to the Scottish Government.

The Lord Advocate serves as the ministerial head of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and as such, is the chief public prosecutor for Scotland with all prosecutions on indictment being conducted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in the Lord Advocate&#x27;s name on behalf of the Monarch. The Lord Advocate serves as the head of the systems of prosecutions in Scotland and is responsible for the investigation of all sudden, suspicious, accidental and unexplained deaths which occur within Scotland.

The officeholder is one of the Great Officers of State of Scotland. The current Lord Advocate is Dorothy Bain KC, who was nominated by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in June 2021. The Lord Advocate is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the incumbent First Minister of Scotland, with the agreement of the Scottish Parliament.

==History==
The office of Advocate to the monarch is an ancient one. The first recorded Lord Advocate was Sir John Ross of Montgreenan, who is formally mentioned in 1483. At that time the post-holder was generally referred to as the &quot;King&#x27;s Advocate&quot; and not until the year 1573 was the term &quot;Lord Advocate&quot; first used.

From 1707 to 1998, the Lord Advocate was the chief legal adviser of the British Government and the Crown on Scottish legal matters, both civil and criminal, until the Scotland Act 1998 devolved most domestic affairs to the Scottish Parliament. His Majesty&#x27;s Government is now advised on Scots law by the Advocate General for Scotland.

The Lord Advocate is not head of the Faculty of Advocates; that position is held by the Dean of the Faculty of Advocates.

==Parliamentary and government role==
===Part of government===

Until devolution in 1999, all Lords Advocate were, by convention, members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords to allow them to speak for the government. Those who were not already members of either house received a life peerage on appointment. Since devolution, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are permitted to attend and speak in the Scottish Parliament &quot;ex officio&quot;, even if they are not Members of the Scottish Parliament.

From 1999 until 2007, the Lord Advocate attended the weekly Scottish Cabinet meetings. However, after the 2007 election, the new First Minister Alex Salmond decided that Lord Advocate would no longer attend the Scottish Cabinet, stating he wished to &quot;de-politicise&quot; the post.

===Postâlord advocate===

Appointments as Senators of the College of Justice were formerly made on the nomination of the Lord Advocate. Every Lord Advocate between 1842 and 1967 was later appointed to the bench, either on demitting office or at a later date. Many lord advocates in fact nominated themselves for appointment as Lord President of the Court of Session or as Lord Justice Clerk.

===Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service===
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is headed by the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland, and is the public prosecution service in Scotland. It also carries out functions which are broadly equivalent to the coroner in common law jurisdictions. Incorporated within the Crown Office is the Legal Secretariat to the Lord Advocate.

===Crown Agent===
The Crown Agent is the principal legal adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters. He or she also acts as Chief Executive for the department and as solicitor in all legal proceedings in which the Lord Advocate appears as representing his or her own department. They issue general instructions for the guidance of Crown counsel, procurators fiscal, sheriff clerks and other public officials; transmit instructions from Crown counsel to procurators fiscal about prosecutions; and in consultation with the Clerk of Justiciary, arrange sittings of the High Court of Justiciary. At trials in the High Court in Edinburgh, they attend as instructing solicitor. They are assisted by other senior legal, managerial and administrative staff.

The Crown Agent also holds the office of King&#x27;s and Lord Treasurer&#x27;s Remembrancer.

==Calls for reform==

In the Greshornish House Accord of 16 September 2008, Professors Hans KÃ¶chler and Robert Black saidâ

It is inappropriate that the Chief Legal Adviser to the Government is also head of all criminal prosecutions. Whilst the Lord Advocate and Solicitor General continue as public prosecutors the principle of separation of powers seems compromised. The potential for a conflict of interest always exists. Resolution of these circumstances would entail an amendment of the provisions contained within the Scotland Act 1998.

The judges of Scotland&#x27;s highest court came to share this view. In a submission to the commission set up to consider how the devolution settlement between Scotland and the United Kingdom could be improved, the judges recommended that the Lord Advocate should cease to be the head of the public prosecution system and should act only as the Scottish Government&#x27;s chief legal adviser. They noted various ways in which the Lord Advocate&#x27;s roles had caused problems for the judicial system, including the ability &quot;to challenge... virtually any act of a prosecutor has led to a plethora of disputed issues, with consequential delays to the holding of trials and to the hearing and completion of appeals against conviction.&quot; The judges proposed three alternative solutions: stripping the Lord Advocate of responsibility for prosecutions, exempting the Lord Advocate from compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, or changing the law on criminal appeals. While not specifically favouring any of the three, they noted that the third proposal was radical enough to &quot;generate considerable controversy&quot;.

<doc id="576245" wikidata="Q325696" url="?curid=576245" title="Pavel Alexandrov">
<text>Pavel Sergeyevich Alexandrov (), sometimes romanized &quot;Paul Alexandroff&quot; (7 May 1896 â 16 November 1982), was a Soviet mathematician. He wrote roughly three hundred papers, making important contributions to set theory and topology. In topology, the Alexandroff compactification and the Alexandrov topology are named after him.

==Biography==
Alexandrov attended Moscow State University where he was a student of Dmitri Egorov and Nikolai Luzin. Together with Pavel Urysohn, he visited the University of GÃ¶ttingen in 1923 and 1924. After getting his Ph.D. in 1927, he continued to work at Moscow State University and also joined the Steklov Institute of Mathematics.

He was made a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1953.

=== Personal life ===
Luzin challenged Alexandrov to determine if the continuum hypothesis is true. This still unsolved problem was too much for Alexandrov and he had a creative crisis at the end of 1917. The failure was a heavy blow for Alexandrov: &quot;It became clear to me that the work on the continuum problem ended in a serious disaster. I also felt that I could no longer move on to mathematics and, so to speak, to the next tasks, and that some decisive turning point must come in my life.&quot;

Alexandrov went to Chernihiv, where he participated in the organization of the drama theater. &quot;I met L. V. Sobinov there, who was at that time the head of the Department of Arts of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education.&quot;

During this period, Alexandrov visited Denikin prison[4] and was ill with typhus.

In 1921, he married Ekaterina Romanovna Eiges (1890-1958) who was a poet and memoirist, library worker and mathematician.

In 1955, he signed the &quot;Letter of Three Hundred&quot; with criticism of Lysenkoism.

Alexandrov made lifelong friends with Andrey Kolmogorov, about whom he said: &quot;In 1979 this friendship [with Kolmogorov] celebrated its fiftieth anniversary and over the whole of this half century there was not only never any breach in it, there was also never any quarrel, in all this time there was never any misunderstanding between us on any question, no matter how important for our lives and our philosophy; even when our opinions on one of these questions differed, we showed complete understanding and sympathy for the views of each other.&quot; Researchers have since conjectured that the two men were in a secret gay relationship.

He was buried at the Kavezinsky cemetery of the Pushkinsky district of the Moscow region.

== Scientific activity ==
Alexandrov&#x27;s main works are on topology, set theory, theory of functions of a real variable, geometry, calculus of variations, mathematical logic, and foundations of mathematics.

He introduced the new concept of compactness (Alexandrov himself called it &quot;Bicompactness&quot;, and applied the term compact to only countably compact spaces, as was customary before him). Together with P. S. Urysohn, Alexandrov showed the full meaning of this concept; in particular, he proved the first general metrization theorem and the famous compactification theorem of any locally compact Hausdorff space by adding a single point.

From 1923 P. S. Alexandrov began to study combinatorial topology, and he managed to combine this branch of topology with general topology and significantly advance the resulting theory, which became the basis for modern algebraic topology. It was he who introduced one of the basic concepts of algebraic topology â the concept of an exact sequence. Alexandrov also introduced the notion of a nerve of a covering, which led him (independently of E. Cech) to the discovery of Alexandrov-Cech Cohomology.

In 1924, Alexandrov proved that in every open cover of a separable metric space, a locally finite open cover can be inscribed (this very concept, one of the key concepts in general topology, was first introduced by Alexandrov. In fact, this proved the paracompact nature of separable metric spaces (although the term &quot;paracompact space&quot; was introduced by Jean DieudonnÃ© in 1944, and in 1948 Arthur Harold Stone showed that the requirement of separability can be abandoned).

He significantly advanced the theory of dimension (in particular, he became the founder of the homological theory of dimension â its basic concepts were defined by Alexandrov in 1932. He developed methods of combinatorial research of general topological spaces, proved a number of basic laws of topological duality. In 1927, he generalized Alexander&#x27;s theorem to the case of an arbitrary closed set.

Alexandrov and P. S. Urysohn were the founders of the Moscow topological school, which received international recognition. A number of concepts and theorems of topology bear Alexandrov&#x27;s name: the Alexandrov compactification, the Alexandrov-Hausdorff theorem on the cardinality of a-sets, the Alexandrov topology, and the Alexandrov â Cech homology and cohomology.

His books played an important role in the development of science and mathematics education in Russia: &quot;Introduction to the General Theory of Sets and Functions&quot;, &quot;Combinatorial Topology&quot;, &quot;Lectures on Analytical Geometry&quot;, &quot;Dimension Theory&quot; (together with B. A. Pasynkov) and &quot;Introduction to Homological Dimension Theory&quot;.

The textbook &quot;Topologie I&quot;, written together with Heinz Hopf in German (Alexandroff P., Hopf H. (1935) &quot;Topologie&quot; Band 1 â Berlin) became the classic course of topology of its time.

=== The Luzin Affair ===
In 1936, Alexandrov was an active participant in the political offensive against his former mentor Luzin that is known as the Luzin affair.

Despite the fact that P. S. Alexandrov was a student of N. N. Luzin and one of the members of Lusitania, during the persecution of Luzin (the Luzin Affair), Alexandrov was one of the most active persecutors of the scientist. Relations between Luzin and Alexandrov remained very strained until the end of Luzin&#x27;s life, and Alexandrov became an academician only after Luzin&#x27;s death.

=== Students ===
Among the students of P. S. Alexandrov, the most famous are Lev Pontryagin, Andrey Tychonoff and Aleksandr Kurosh. The older generation of his students includes L. A. Tumarkin, V. V. Nemytsky, A. N. Cherkasov, N. B. Vedenisov, G. S. Chogoshvili. The group of &quot;Forties&quot; includes Yu. M. Smirnov, K. A. Sitnikov, O. V. Lokutsievsky, E. F. Mishchenko, M. R. Shura-Bura. The generation of the fifties includes A.V. Arkhangelsky, B. A. Pasynkov, V. I. Ponomarev, as well as E. G. Sklyarenko and A. A. Maltsev, who were in graduate school under Yu.M. Smirnov and K. A. Sitnikov, respectively. The group of the youngest students is formed by V. V. Fedorchuk, V. I. Zaitsev and E. V. Shchepin.

<text>The Pribnow box (also known as the Pribnow-Schaller box) is a sequence of &quot;TATAAT&quot; of six nucleotides (thymine, adenine, thymine, etc.) that is an essential part of a promoter site on DNA for transcription to occur in bacteria. It is an idealized or consensus sequenceâthat is, it shows the most frequently occurring base at each position in many promoters analyzed; individual promoters often vary from the consensus at one or more positions. It is also commonly called the -10 sequence or element, because it is centered roughly ten base pairs upstream from the site of initiation of transcription.

The Pribnow box has a function similar to the TATA box that occurs in promoters in eukaryotes and archaea: it is recognized and bound by a subunit of RNA polymerase during initiation of transcription. This region of the DNA is also the first place where base pairs separate during prokaryotic transcription to allow access to the template strand. The AT-richness is important to allow this separation, since adenine and thymine are easier to break apart (not only due to fewer hydrogen bonds, but also due to weaker base stacking effects).

It is named after David Pribnow and Heinz Schaller.

==Probability of occurrence of each nucleotide in &quot;E. coli&quot;==
==In fiction==
The term &quot;Pribnow box&quot; is used in episode 13 of &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, in reference to the chamber holding simulation Evangelions for testing purposes.

<doc id="576250" wikidata="Q189164" url="?curid=576250" title="Feodor Chaliapin">
<text>Feodor Ivanovich Chaliapin (; 12 April 1938) was a Russian opera singer. Possessing a deep and expressive bass voice, he enjoyed an important international career at major opera houses and is often credited with establishing the tradition of naturalistic acting in his chosen art form.

During the first phase of his career, Chaliapin endured direct competition from three other great basses: the powerful (1869â1942), the more lyrical Vladimir Kastorsky (1871â1948), and Dmitri Buchtoyarov (1866â1918), whose voice was intermediate between those of Sibiriakov and Kastorsky. The fact that Chaliapin is far and away the best remembered of this magnificent quartet of rival basses is a testament to the power of his personality, the acuteness of his musical interpretations, and the vividness of his performances.

==Spelling note==
He himself spelled his surname, French-style, Chaliapine in the West, and his name even appeared on early His Master&#x27;s Voice 78s as Theodore Chaliapine. In English texts, his given name is most usually rendered as Feodor or Fyodor, and his surname is most usually seen as Chaliapin. However, in the Russian pronunciation the initial consonant Ð¨ is pronounced like &quot;sh&quot; in &quot;shop&quot;, not as &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;chop&quot;, and in reference books the surname is sometimes given a strict romanization as Shalyapin. This spelling also better reflects the fact that the name is pronounced with three syllables (Sha-LYA-pin), not four.

==Early life==
Feodor Chaliapin was born into a peasant family on 1 February (OS), 1873 in Kazan, in the wing of merchant Lisitzin&#x27;s house on Rybnoryadskaya Street (now Pushkin Street) 10. This wing no longer exists, but the house with the yard where the wing was situated is still there. The next day, Candlemas (The Meeting of Our Lord), he was baptized in Epiphany (Bogoyavlenskaya) Church on Bolshaya Prolomnaya street (now Bauman Street). His godparents were his neighbors: the shoemaker Nikolay Tonkov and Ludmila Kharitonova, a 12-year-old girl. The dwelling was expensive for his father, Ivan Yakovlevich, who served as a clerk in the Zemskaya Uprava (Zemstvo District Council), and in 1878 the Chaliapin family moved to the village of Ametyevo (also Ometyevo, or the Ometyev settlements, now a settlement within Kazan) behind the area of Sukonnaya Sloboda, and settled in a small house.

== Early career ==
His vocal teacher was Dmitri Usatov (1847-1913). Chaliapin began his career at Tbilisi and at the Imperial Opera in Saint Petersburg in 1894. He was then invited to sing at the Mamontov Private Opera (1896â1899); he first appeared there as Mephistopheles in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, in which role he achieved considerable success.

At Mamontov Chaliapin met Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943), who was serving as an assistant conductor there and with whom he remained friends for life. Rachmaninoff taught him much about musicianship, including how to analyze a music score, and insisted that Chaliapin learn not only his own roles but also all the other roles in the operas in which he was scheduled to appear. With Rachmaninoff he learned the title role of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, which became his signature character. Chaliapin returned the favor by showing Rachmaninoff how he built each of his interpretations around a culminating moment or &quot;point&quot;. Regardless of where that point was or at which dynamic within that piece, the performer had to know how to approach it with absolute calculation and precision; otherwise, the whole construction of the piece could crumble and the piece could become disjointed. Rachmaninoff put this approach to considerable use when he became a full-time concert-pianist after World War I.

On the strength of his Mamontov appearances, the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow engaged Chaliapin, and he appeared there regularly from 1899 until 1914. During the First World War of 1914-1918 Chaliapin also appeared regularly at the Zimin Private Opera in Moscow. In addition, from 1901, Chaliapin began touring in the West, making a sensational debut at La Scala that year as the devil in a production of Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, under the baton of one of the 20th century&#x27;s most dynamic opera conductors, Arturo Toscanini. At the end of his career, Toscanini observed that the Russian bass was the greatest operatic talent with whom he had ever worked. The singer&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera debut in the 1907 season was disappointing due to the unprecedented frankness of his stage acting; but he returned to the Met in 1921 and sang there with immense success for eight seasons, New York&#x27;s audiences having grown more broad-minded since 1907. In 1913 Chaliapin was introduced to London and Paris by the brilliant entrepreneur Sergei Diaghilev (1872-1929), at which point he began giving well-received solo recitals in which he sang traditional Russian folk-songs as well as more serious fare. Such folk songs included &quot;Along Peterskaya&quot; (which he recorded with a British-based Russian folk-instrument orchestra) and the song which he made famous throughout the world: &quot;The Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot;. In 1925, when he performed in New York, his piano accompanist was a young Harry Lubin (1906-1977), later to become a composer of music for the television series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;.
==Later life==

Chaliapin toured Australia in 1926, giving a series of recitals which were highly acclaimed. Privately, Chaliapin&#x27;s personal affairs were in a state of disarray as a consequence of the Russian Revolution of 1917. At first he was treated as a revered artist of the newly emerged Soviet Russia. However, the harsh realities of everyday life under the new regime, and the unstable climate which followed because of the ensuing Civil War, combined with, reportedly, the encroachment on some of his property by the Communist authorities, caused him to remain perpetually outside Russia after 1921. Chaliapin initially moved to Finland and later lived in France. Cosmopolitan Paris, with its significant Russian Ã©migrÃ© population, became his base, and ultimately, the city of his death. He was renowned for his larger-than-life carousing during this period, but he never sacrificed his dedication to his art.

Chaliapin&#x27;s attachment to Paris did not prevent him from pursuing an international operatic and concert career in England, the United States, and further afield. In May 1931 he appeared in the Russian Season directed by Sir Thomas Beecham at London&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre. His most famous part was the title role of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; (excerpts of which he recorded 1929â31 and earlier). He is remembered also for his interpretations of Ivan the Terrible in Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot; and Salieri in &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;, Mephistopheles in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, Don Quixote in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Don Quichotte&quot;, and King Philip in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;.

Largely owing to his advocacy, Russian operas such as Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot;, Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot; and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot; and &quot;Sadko&quot;, became well known in the West.

Chaliapin made one sound film for the director G. W. Pabst, the 1933 &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. The film was made in three different versions â French, English, and German, as was sometimes the prevailing custom. Chaliapin starred in all three versions, each of which used the same script, sets, and costumes, but different supporting casts. The English and the French versions are the most often seen, and both were released in May 2006 on a DVD. Pabst&#x27;s film was not a version of the Massenet opera but a dramatic adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; novel, with music and songs by Jacques Ibert.

In 1932, Chaliapin published a memoir, &quot;Man and Mask: Forty Years in the Life of a Singer&quot;. While touring Japan in 1936 he was suffering from a toothache, and a hotel chef devised a way to cook a steak to be extra tender for him. This dish is known in Japan as a to this day.

Chaliapin&#x27;s last stage performance took place at the Monte Carlo Opera in 1937, as Boris Godunov.Chaliapin lived in Paris, at 22 Avenue d&#x27;Eylau, where he died of leukemia. Buried in Paris, Chaliapin rested in the Batignolles cemetery until 1984, when his remains were transferred to the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow.

He owned a beautiful villa on the Sainte-Barbe hill in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, overlooking the Bay of Biscay. 

==Personal life==
Chaliapin was married twice. He met his first wife, Italian ballerina Iola Tornaghi (1873â1965), in Nizhny Novgorod. They married in Russia in 1898 and had six children: Igor, Boris (1904â1979), Irina, Lidia and twins Feodor Jr. (1905â1992) and Taniya. Igor died aged four. Feodor Jr. was a character actor featured in Western motion pictures including &quot;Moonstruck&quot; and &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; opposite Sean Connery. Boris was a well-known graphical artist, who painted the portraits used on 414 covers of the &quot;Time&quot; magazine between 1942 and 1970.

While married to Tornaghi, Chaliapin lived with Marina Petsold (1882â1964), a widow who already had two children from her first marriage. She had three daughters with Chaliapin: Marfa (1910â2003), (1912â2009), and Dasya (1921â1977). Chaliapin&#x27;s two families lived separately, one in Moscow and the other in Saint Petersburg, and did not interact. Chaliapin married Petsold in 1927 in Paris.

Chaliapin had his portrait painted a number of times by the Russian artist Konstantin Korovin. They had been introduced to each other in 1896 and became close friends.

== Autobiographical works ==

Chaliapin&#x27;s autobiographical collaboration with Maxim Gorky occurred in 1917. He had already begun writing his autobiography long before, in the Crimea. In 1917, while he was in the south of France, he was urged to write such a work by a French journalist who hoped to ghost-write it. Gorky, who was his intimate friend and was then living in Capri, persuaded Chaliapin to stay with him there and with the help of a secretary a great deal of information was taken down which Gorky fashioned into a long manuscript, published in Russia in 1917 as a series of articles in the journal &quot;Letopis&quot;. Meanwhile, Chaliapin attempted to sell it to an American publisher, who refused it on learning that it had been published in Russian. There was a rift with Gorky, and Chaliapin worked with another editor to produce a &#x27;new&#x27; version of his original text. The new book, published in America as &quot;Pages of My Life&quot; (Harper and Brothers, New York 1927), took the story only up to 1905, and lacked the depth, style and life of Gorky&#x27;s version. Then, in 1932, Chaliapin published &quot;Man and Mask&quot; (Alfred A. Knopf, New York) to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of his first stage appearance. The original manuscript of the Gorky version was first translated and published in English in 1967, by Nina Froud and James Hanley, as &quot;Chaliapin: An autobiography as told to Maxim Gorky&quot; (Stein and Day, New York), and included an appendix of original correspondence including a section relating to Gorky.

==Recordings==
Chaliapin possessed a high-lying bass voice with an unmistakable timbre which recorded clearly. He cut a prolific number of discs for the Gramophone Company, beginning in Russia with acoustical recordings made at the dawn of the 20th Century, and continuing through the early electrical (microphone) era. Some of his performances at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London were recorded live in the 1920s, including a haunting version of the &quot;Death of Boris&quot; from &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. His last disc, made in Tokyo in 1936, was of the famous &quot;The Song of the Volga Boatmen&quot;. Many of his recordings were issued in the United States by RCA Victor. His legacy of recordings is available on CDs issued by EMI, Preiser, Naxos and other commercial labels. In 2018 his complete recordings were issued on 13 CDs by Marston Records. They consist of songs as well as a range of arias from Italian, French and, Russian opera.

==Opinions on his art==
* Opera commentator/historian Michael Scott avers that: &quot;Chaliapin ranks with Caruso and Maria Callas as one of the three greatest singers and most potent and influential artists of the twentieth century.&quot;
* &quot;At the Met he sang the role of Basilio in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; as a vulgar, unctuous, greasy priest, constantly picking his nose and wiping his fingers onto his cassock. Audiences were appalled. Defending himself, Chaliapin said in an interview that Basilio &#x27;is a Spanish priest. It is a type I know well. He is not the modern American priest, clean and well-groomed; he is dirty and unkempt, he is a beast, and this is what I make him, a comic beast.&#x27; &quot; (Harold C. Schonberg)
* Some accused Chaliapin of brawling backstage. Rachmaninoff agreed. &quot;Feodor &quot;is&quot; a brawler. They are all scared of his very spirit. He shouts suddenly or even hits someone! And Feodor&#x27;s fist is powerful ... He can take care of himself. And how else should one behave? Backstage at our own theater it&#x27;s just like a saloon. They shout, they drink, they swear in the foulest language.&quot; In a letter from November 1910 to the editor of Utro Rossii, the publication which supposedly quoted the above remarks and which attributes them to Rachmaninoff, the composer categorically denies the quotation and wrote &quot;The article publishes without my knowledge words of mine about the Bolshoi Theater and Chaliapin...I said that we often have regrettable confusion backstage at the Bolshoi Theater...I also said that I had heard rumors that since Chaliapin had been appointed rÃ©gisseur of those operas in which he sings, there is more quiet backstage. That is all I said... S. Rachmaninoff&quot;.
* Met diva Geraldine Farrar said Chaliapin had a voice like &quot;melodious thunder&quot; but warned of his unannounced antics to hog the limelight onstage. &quot;Chaliapin was a wonderful opera partner, but one had to be watchful for sudden departures from the rehearsal plan, and the touches of originality favorable only for the aggrandizement of Chaliapin.&quot;
* Dale Carnegie, referencing a story by impresario Sol Hurok, says that Chaliapin was often temperamental, even acting like a âspoiled child.â On hearing the concert basso&#x27;s complaint that his throat was raw and that he would not be able to sing at a scheduled performance at the Metropolitan Opera, Hurok agreed immediately to cancel the engagement, commenting: âIt will only cost you a couple of thousand dollars, but that is nothing in comparison to your reputation.â Chaliapin left open the possibility that he might nevertheless perform if he felt better later, and Hurok dutifully checked on him twice before the concert time. Finally he agreed to perform, provided that Hurok would announce to the audience that Chaliapin âhad a very bad cold and was not in good voice.â Carnegie comments approvingly: âMr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it, for he knew that was the only way to get the basso out on the stage.â

<doc id="576251" wikidata="Q2340255" url="?curid=576251" title="Cliff Bleszinski">
<text>Cliff Bleszinski (; born February 12, 1975), popularly known as CliffyB, is an American video game designer, known for his work on the &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Gears of War&quot; series while at Epic Games. After leaving Epic in 2012, he co-founded Boss Key Productions in 2014 which closed in 2018 after the commercial failure of the multiplayer shooter &quot;LawBreakers&quot;. Since Boss Key&#x27;s closure, Bleszinski has spent his time with theater and writing.

== Career ==
Bleszinski&#x27;s first game was &quot;The Palace of Deceit&quot;, an adventure title he started at the age of 15. Programmed in Visual Basic, its second version came out when he was 16.

=== Epic Games (1992â2012) ===
Bleszinski got his start at Epic Games in 1992, after submitting his game &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; to the company&#x27;s CEO, Tim Sweeney. Though &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; did not achieve a great success, it led Bleszinski to work on &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, a platformer co-developed by demoscene coder Arjan Brussee. The title, which came out in 1994, became Epic&#x27;s biggest selling game at the time, earning him enough money to buy his first apartment and car. It was also around this time that he joined Sweeney and James Schmalz on what would become &quot;Unreal&quot;, which received a follow-up, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, and expanded into a series of games.

In addition to his work on the &quot;Unreal&quot; series, Bleszinski served as creative consultant on &quot;Rune&quot;, and as lead designer on the first three installments of the &quot;Gears of War&quot; franchise, which has sold over 22 million copies and earned over one billion in revenue as of January 2014. &quot;Gears of War&quot; evolved out of the development of what was going to be a game called &quot;Unreal Warfare&quot;. As Bleszinski explained in a speech at GDC 2007 entitled &quot;Designing Gears of War: Iteration Wins,&quot; the game started out as another first-person shooter in the &quot;Unreal&quot; universe. Over time, however, influenced by the cover mechanic in Namco&#x27;s 2003 game &quot;Kill Switch&quot; and the third-person &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Unreal Warfare&quot; became the game known as &quot;Gears of War&quot;. In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.
After 20 years with the company, Cliff announced his departure from Epic Games on October 3, 2012, saying he had been making video games since he was a teen and wanted to take a break. According to a 2015 interview, his original intention was to retire permanently. &quot;I honestly thought I was done... It was a combination of gamers feeling jaded, as well as working with some very talented people who were also very jaded,&quot; Bleszinski told Destructoid. &quot;I could pitch the most amazing idea to anybody back when I was at Epic toward the end, and they&#x27;d be like &#x27;I don&#x27;t buy it,&#x27;&quot; he added.

=== Boss Key Productions (2014â2018) ===
On June 30, 2014, Cliff announced on Twitter that he was &quot;coming out of retirement to make video games again&quot; and would be unveiling his next project in the next week. The new game, a free-to-play, PC-focused arena shooter code-named &quot;BlueStreak&quot;, would be published by Nexon and developed by his new studio, Boss Key Productions, which he co-founded with Brussee the same year. A year later, Bleszinski revealed that the arena shooter would be called &quot;LawBreakers&quot;.

In May 2016, he joined the board of advisers for Fig, a mixed crowdfunding/investment platform for video games.

On May 14, 2018, Bleszinski announced the dissolution of Boss Key Productions, citing lackluster sales.

=== Later career (2018âpresent) ===
After the closure of Boss Key, Bleszinski has gotten involved with theater production. He invested and co-produced &quot;Hadestown&quot;, and was similarly involved with a revival of &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;.
He has also expressed interest in returning to the &quot;Gears of War&quot; series as an adviser.

His memoir, &quot;Control Freak: My Epic Adventure Making Video Games&quot;, was published in November 2022 by Simon &amp; Schuster.

In April 2023, Bleszinski announced that he was writing a comic book series titled &quot;Scrapper&quot; in collaboration with Alex De Campi, with illustrations by Sandy Jarrell. Its first issue will be released on July 19 by Image Comics.

== Personal life ==
Cliff is married to Lauren Bleszinski (nÃ©e Berggren), a former professional gamer and id Software employee. Previously, he was married to a woman named Darcy. One of his brothers is Tyler Bleszinski, the founder of Polygon sister site SB Nation. Their father, who died when Cliff was 15, was an engineer for Polaroid. The nickname &quot;CliffyB&quot; was given to him derogatorily by &quot;some jock kid&quot; when he was a shy teenager; he then took it and developed a tougher persona around it. However, in 2008 he expressed a desire to retire the moniker, saying it&#x27;s &quot;time to grow up a bit&quot;.

In 1987, Bleszinski got a Nintendo Entertainment System for Christmas, which turned him into a huge video game fan. &quot;My friends nicknamed me &#x27;Nintendo Boy&#x27; because my entire life revolved around my NES. I was eating Nintendo cereal, wearing Nintendo clothing. My dream job was to work for Nintendo. I was pretty inseparable from my NES,&quot; said Bleszinski. He said his favorite NES game of all time is &quot;Zanac&quot;.

In 1988, at 13, Cliff appeared in the first issue of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; for earning the high score of 9,999,950 in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;. Regarding the achievement, he commented in a 2017 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;that was probably one of the moments when I realized, deep-down and subconsciously, I wanted to be a &#x27;name&#x27; in this business of video games.&quot; He also went to the Nintendo World Championships when he was 15, coming in second in Massachusetts.

In 1998, Bleszinski rose to fame in the Internet when he held a contest inviting visitors of his website to scan their cats on flatbed scanners and submit the photos for judging.

In 2000, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; featured Bleszinski in the cover of its November issue, calling him one of the &quot;Next Game Gods.&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; magazine awarded him a &quot;Rave Award&quot; in 2007 for his work on &quot;Gears of War&quot;. Shortly before the release of its sequel, Bleszinski was profiled in 2008 by Tom Bissell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in an article titled &quot;The Grammar of Fun&quot;. On April 12, 2010, he appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, where he showed the debut trailer for &quot;Gears of War 3&quot; and cited &quot;Space Invaders&quot; as the game that initially inspired him.

Bleszinski has opened two bars in Raleigh, North Carolina, the first one in 2014 called &quot;The Station&quot;, followed by &quot;The Raleigh Beer Garden&quot; in 2015.

<doc id="576252" wikidata="Q5290204" url="?curid=576252" title="Domestic relations">
<text>In the common law tradition, the law of domestic relations is a broad category that encompasses:

* divorce;
* property settlements;
* alimony, spousal support, or other maintenance;
* the establishment of paternity;
* the establishment or termination of parental rights;
* child support;
* child custody;
* visitation; 
* adoption; and
* Emancipation of minors.

In some jurisdictions, guardianships, truancy, and matters related to juvenile delinquency are considered part of the law of domestic relations.

Many sorts of dispute fall into this broad category; many people who will not otherwise have any dealings during their lives with the judicial system have domestic relations disputes. Because of the volume of legal business generated by the law of domestic relations, a number of jurisdictions have established specialized courts of limited jurisdiction, sometimes called &quot;family courts&quot;, which hear domestic cases exclusively.

<text>&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. Six anime installments based on the franchise have been produced by Toei Animation: &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; (1986); &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; (1989); &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot; (1996); &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; (2015); and &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot; (2024); followed by the web series &quot;Super Dragon Ball Heroes&quot; (2018). Since 1986, twenty one theatrical animated films based on the franchise have been released: four based on the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; anime, fifteen based on &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, and two based on &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. There are also several television specials that were broadcast on Fuji TV and two short films, which were shown at the 2008 Jump Super Anime Tour and Jump Festa 2012 respectively. A two-part hour-long crossover TV special between &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, and &quot;Toriko&quot; aired on Fuji TV in 2013. Additionally, there is a two-part original video animation created as strategy guides for the 1993 video game &quot;Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans&quot;, which was remade in 2010 and included with the &quot;Raging Blast 2&quot; video game.

As with the franchise&#x27;s anime television series, all 20 films and the first three TV specials were licensed in North America by Funimation. In Europe, AB Groupe licensed the first three &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; movies, the first nine &quot;Z&quot; movies, and the first two TV specials.

&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; is one of the most successful franchises in animation history. The anime series is broadcast in more than 80countries worldwide. In the United States, the anime series has sold more than 30million DVD and Blu-ray units as of 2017.

The &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; franchise has spawned three one-hour long television specials that aired on Fuji TV, the first two based on the &quot;Z&quot; portion of the series and the third based on the &quot;GT&quot; portion. Of these specials, the first and third are original stories created by the anime staff, while the second is based on a special chapter of the manga.

Though the specials aired on TV in Japan, Funimation&#x27;s North American releases of the episodes are on home video, each one labeled &quot;Feature&quot; the same as their theatrical films. This, doubled with the inclusion of the &quot;Z&quot; specials in Funimation&#x27;s remastered &quot;Movie Double Features&quot; has caused fans to continue to erroneously believe these to be theatrical films, when they are not.

On April 7, 2013, a two-part hour-long crossover TV special, between &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Toriko&quot;, referred to as &quot;Dream 9 Toriko &amp; One Piece &amp; Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!&quot; aired on Fuji TV. The first part is named and the second is titled . The plot has the International Gourmet Organization (from &quot;Toriko&quot;) sponsoring the Tenka&#x27;ichi ShokuÅkai, a race with no rules that characters from all three series compete in.

On October 8, 2017, a two-part TV special of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; aired on Fuji TV. It counted as both episodes 109 and 110 of the series.

On December 2, 2018, as part of promoting new film &quot;Broly&quot;, a one-hour television special aired on Fuji TV in Japan entitled &quot;Just Before the Dragon Ball Super Movie Debut! Looking Back on the TV Show&#x27;s Climax &quot;.

It was later released on DVD in the February 3, 2012 issue of &quot;SaikyÅ Jump&quot; together with &quot;Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans&quot;.

The complete OVA was included in the second &quot;Dragon Ball Z Dragon Box&quot; DVD set released in Japan in 2003.

The OVA was remade for the 2010 PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game &quot;Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2&quot; under the title &quot;Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans&quot;.

<doc id="576260" wikidata="Q1887065" url="?curid=576260" title="Peter Pond">
<text>Peter Pond (January 18, 1739 â 1807) was an American explorer, cartographer, merchant and soldier who was a founding member of the North West Company and the Beaver Club. Though he was born and died in Milford, Connecticut, most of his life was spent in northwestern North America, on the upper Mississippi and in western Canada.

==Early life==

Pond, born on in January 18, 1739 at Milford, Connecticut, began his fur trading career with his father out of Fort Detroit. He traded throughout the regions south of Lake Superior and west of Lake Michigan, which later became Minnesota and Wisconsin. During the French and Indian War, Pond enlisted in the Connecticut Regiment, a provincial infantry unit. A narrative of his early life was published in the 1933 book &quot;Five Fur Traders of the Northwest&quot;. 

Through his business he became acquainted with Alexander Henry the elder, Simon McTavish and the brothers Thomas, Benjamin and Joseph Frobisher. They would be the founders of the North West Company (NWC) in 1779, which developed a fierce rivalry with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). Working for the group, In search of new fur resources, Pond went to the area west of the Great Lakes. In 1776â1778 he wintered at a fur post he established at the junction of the Sturgeon River and North Saskatchewan River near present-day Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The site is today a National Historic Site.

He was chosen to take four canoes northward into the Athabasca region. He took his party through the Portage La Loche (the Methye portage). It took the group eight days to travel about 12 miles. In 1778-1779 he wintered at Pond House, a post he built on the Athabasca River, 60 kms from Lake Athabasca. Likely this was the first fur trading post inside today&#x27;s Alberta. He collected so many furs he did not have capacity to haul them all away in one trip. He operated this post, the first white man&#x27;s building in present-day Alberta, for ten years

At Lac La Ronge, Jean-Ãtienne Waddens had a lucrative trade with âthe Northward Indiansâ coming from Lake Athabasca. In late 1781, Pond, a man who too represented the company&#x27;s interests, joined him. However, they were on bad terms. In March 1782, Pond fatally wounded Waddens in a fight. The act was called murder. In 1783, Mrs. Waddens requested the governor of Quebec, Frederick Haldimand, to arrest Pond, submitting an affidavit of one of Waddensâ men. Pond was examined in 1785 but was not brought to trial, most likely because Lac La Ronge lay in the territories of the HBC, beyond the jurisdiction of the Province of Quebec.

==Explorations==

In 1783, Pond&#x27;s explorations led him again to the Athabasca, a region stretching from Lac Ãle-Ã -la-Crosse to the Peace River. There he explored waterways around Lake Athabasca and determined the approximate locations of Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake from First Nations peoples of the area. From his notes and diaries Peter Pond drew a map showing rivers and lakes of the Athabasca region, including what was known of the whole area from Hudson Bay to the Rocky Mountains and interpolating his information to the Arctic Ocean or Northwest Passage.

In 1785, one copy of Pond&#x27;s map, accompanied by a detailed report, was submitted to the United States Congress and a second to the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, Henry Hamilton. Pond needed financial support to carry his explorations to the limits of North America&#x27;s northwest, but the British government was not forthcoming. A partner in the NWC, founded in 1784, he was in charge of the company business in the Athabasca and Peace River areas. An ambitious man with a reputation for having a violent temper, he was implicated in two murders (one of a rival trader): Although acquitted on the murder charges, the company replaced him with Alexander Mackenzie. In the process of taking over the management of the business Mackenzie learned a great deal from Peter Pond about the Athabasca and Peace River region. Pond left the NWC in 1788.

==Later life and death==

Mackenzie was intrigued by Pond&#x27;s belief that the tributaries of that area, which could be seen gathering into a great river flowing northwestward, flowed to the Northwest Passage. Mackenzie took the initiative to follow up on Pond&#x27;s belief and followed this great river to its mouth; the watercourse, now called the Mackenzie River, did in fact flow to the Northwest Passage section of the Arctic Ocean. Peter Pond had contributed to the mapping of Canada by drawing the general outline of the river basin that Mackenzie recorded in 1789. The maps that Peter Pond subsequently drew, based on his explorations and on the information provided to him by First Nations peoples, ultimately gained international recognition for Pond at the end of the 18th century.

In 1790, Pond sold his shares in the NWC to William McGillivray. He returned to Milford, Connecticut, where he died in 1807.

<doc id="576261" wikidata="Q1117138" url="?curid=576261" title="Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer">
<text>Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer (2 June 1850 â 29 March 1935) was a British physiologist.

He is regarded as a founder of endocrinology: in 1894 he discovered and demonstrated the existence of adrenaline together with George Oliver, and he also coined the term &quot;endocrine&quot; for the secretions of the ductless glands. Schafer&#x27;s method of artificial respiration is named after him.

Schafer coined the word &quot;insulin&quot; after theorising that absence of a single substance normally produced by the pancreas was responsible for diabetes mellitus.

==Biography==

He was born Edward Albert SchÃ¤fer, in Hornsey in London, the third son of Jessie Brown and James William Henry SchÃ¤fer, a merchant born in Hamburg, who had come to England as a young man, and was a naturalised citizen. His mother was English. The family lived in Highgate in north-west London.

Edward was educated at Clewer House School. From 1868 he studied medicine at University College London, where he was taught by the eminent physiologist William Sharpey. He became the first Sharpey Scholar in 1873.

In 1877 Sharpey-Schafer reported to the Royal Society his discovery in jellyfish of what eventually came to be dubbed the nerve synapse; the Royal Society was skeptical of the unconventional notion of such spaces separating individual neurons, and asked him to withdraw his report. In 1888, in Spain, Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal, having used the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi&#x27;s technique for staining nerve cells, published &quot;his&quot; discovery of the nerve synapse, which in 1889 finally gained acceptance and won RamÃ³n y Cajal recognition as a, alongside Golgi â many say, &quot;the&quot; â &quot;founder of modern neuroscience&quot;.

Sharpey-Schafer was appointed Assistant Professor of Practical Physiology in 1874 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1878 when he was 28 years old. He was Fullerian Professor at the Royal Institution and became Jodrell Professor at UCL in 1883, a position he held until 1899 when he was appointed to the chair of physiology at the University of Edinburgh (replacing the late William Rutherford) where he remained until his retirement in 1933 and becoming Emeritus Professor thereafter. His chair was filled by Prof Ivan De Burgh Daly.

In 1900 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir William Turner, Alexander Crum Brown, Sir John Murray, and Alexander Buchan. He served as the Society&#x27;s Vice President from 1913 to 1917 and as President 1929 to 1934. He won the Society&#x27;s Neill Prize for 1919 to 1921.

In 1902 he commissioned the Scottish architect Robert Lorimer to design Marly Knowe, a substantial Arts and Crafts villa in the coastal town of North Berwick, east of Edinburgh.

Schafer was a founding member of the Physiological Society and from 1908 until 1933 edited the &quot;Quarterly Journal of Experimental Physiology&quot;. He was the recipient of many honorary degrees and prestigious medals both at home and abroad, including the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh. His book on the &quot;Essentials of Histology&quot; ran to 16 editions between 1885 and 1954. He introduced suprarenal extract (containing adrenaline as well as other active substances) into medicine. Schafer became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1878, was president of the British Science Association in 1911â1912, was president of the British Medical Association in 1912.

He was knighted by King George V in 1913.

He died at home in North Berwick on 29 March 1935.

==Family==

He was married twice, firstly in 1878 to Maud Dixey and after her death in 1896, in 1900 he married Ethel Maud Roberts. There were four children by his first marriage, however, he outlived three of them: his eldest daughter died in 1905 and both his sons died in action in World War I.

Following the death of his eldest son, John Sharpey Schafer, the name of âSharpey&#x27;, which had been given as a middle name, was hyphenated to Schafer, becoming thereafter (from 1918) Sharpey-Schafer. This was both in memory of his son, and also to perpetuate the name of his teacher, William Sharpey.

His grandson, Edward Peter Sharpey-Schafer, was Professor of Medicine at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, London from 1948 until his death in 1963.

His sister married James Cossar Ewart.

==Students==
His students included James Davidson Stuart Cameron and Alexander Murray Drennan.

==Works==
Besides valuable papers on muscular structure, on the chemistry of blood proteids, on absorption, and on the rhythm of voluntary contraction, he wrote: 
* &quot;A Course of Practical Histology&quot; (1877)
* &quot;Essentials of Histology&quot; (1885; sixth edition, 1902)
* &quot;Advanced Text-Book of Physiology by British Physiologists&quot; (1898)
* &quot;Experimental Physiology&quot; (1910)

He edited Quain&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Anatomy&quot; (with G. D. Thane, 8th, 9th, and 10th editions).

==Terms==
* Schaefer&#x27;s method â (artificial respiration) â Patient prone with forehead on one of his arms: straddle across patient with knees on either side of his hips, and press with both hands firmly upon the back over the lower ribs; then raise your body slowly, at the same time relaxing the pressure with your hands. Repeat this forward and backward movement about every five seconds. 
::Dorland&#x27;s Medical Dictionary (1938)

<doc id="576262" wikidata="Q1617106" url="?curid=576262" title="Darton">
<text>Darton is a large village in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley (part of South Yorkshire), on the border with West Yorkshire, England. At the time of the 2001 UK census, it had a population of 14,927, increasing to 21,345 for both Darton Wards (East &amp; West) at the 2011 Census.

==Parliamentary representation==
Formerly part of the now defunct Barnsley West and Penistone borough constituency, following the Boundary Commission for England&#x27;s report on South Yorkshire&#x27;s Parliamentary constituencies in 2004 and an inquiry in 2005, it is now part of the Barnsley Central borough constituency.

==Geography==
Darton lies on the River Dearne, directly to the east of Kexbrough, and is situated about west of Mapplewell, north of Barnsley, south-west of Wakefield, south-east of Huddersfield, south of Leeds, and north of Sheffield. It is served by the A637 road and is bisected by the M1 motorway (junction 38 being a mile to the north). Its location is approximately , at an elevation of around above mean sea level.

==History==
The name &quot;Darton&quot; is believed to be an amalgamation of &quot;Dearne&quot; and the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;ton&quot; (meaning &#x27;town&#x27;). Hence, in ancient times it was known as &quot;â³the town on the Dearneâ³&quot;. However, other sources dispute this explanation and claim that the name originates from a description given to a deer enclosure or something similar. In 1086 the hamlet of &quot;Dertone&quot; was in the wapentake of Staincross.

The hamlet grew to become a village so the Parish of Darton was founded in 1150, when the first church was built. As elsewhere in England, an official register of baptisms, deaths and marriages did not begin until later, in 1539. The parish was historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire and became a part of the former county of South Yorkshire upon its creation in 1974.

==Present day==
Darton has its own railway station on Northern&#x27;s Hallam Line which links train journeys between Sheffield and Leeds. The railway station is in South Yorkshire but West Yorkshire Metro tickets are also valid to and from this station. The reason for this is because the West-South Yorkshire boundary ran between the village and its main source of employment, Woolley Colliery.

On 15 June 2007, Darton hit the national headlines after 48 hours of torrential rain caused the River Dearne to burst its banks leading to heavy flooding in the village. The main road through the village was rendered impassable and many homes and businesses were damaged, including the village post office, which re-opened in June 2008. Further flooding occurred in January 2008, although the damage and disruption caused this time was not as bad as the previous year&#x27;s.

== Education ==
Darton has its own primary school and a secondary school called Darton Academy actually in Kexborough which opened in 2011. The new building (and rebranded school) replaced Darton High School -previously Darton Hall Senior School - that had been on the site since 1957.

==Sport==
*Darton cricket club plays in the Pontefract and District Cricket League.
*North Gawber Colliery F.C. are based in the village and play in the Sheffield and Hallamshire County Senior League Premier Division.

==Notable people==
*David Booth â manager of Laos national football team
*Thomas Brackin â English first-class cricketer
*Ian Butler â English professional footballer
*Michael Clapham â Labour Party politician

<doc id="576265" wikidata="Q1295864" url="?curid=576265" title="El Cajas National Park">
<text>El Cajas National Park or Cajas National Park () is a national park in the highlands of Ecuador. It is located about 30Â km west from Cuenca, the capital of the province of Azuay. The area of 285.44Â km2 (28,544 ha) between 3100m and 4450m above sea level is characterized by pÃ¡ramo vegetation on a jagged landscape of hills and valleys. It was declared a National Park on November 5, 1996 by resolution NÂ° 057.

==Name==
The name &quot;Cajas&quot; is derived from the Quichua word &quot;cassa&quot; meaning &quot;gateway to the snowy mountains&quot;. or &quot;caxa&quot; (Quichua:cold). It has also been linked to the Spanish word &quot;cajas&quot; (boxes).

==Geography and climate==
The highest point is the 4,450 m high Cerro Arquitectos (Architects Hill), and the elevation of roads reaches higher than 4,310 meters (13,550 feet). About 270 lakes and lagoons are present in the pÃ¡ramo of Cajas. Luspa is the largest of these lake and extends over 78 hectares with a maximum depth of 68 m at a perimeter of 5,161 m. Like the other lakes it is of glacial origin, and glaciation shaped the landscape of Cajas leaving U-shaped valleys and ravines. Cajas provides about 60% of the drinking water for the Cuenca area. Two of the four rivers of Cuenca originate from Cajas, the Tomebamba and Yanuncay rivers which eventually drain into the Amazon River. The Paute river also links to the Amazon. As the park straddles the continental divide, its western drainage, the Balao and CaÃ±ar link to the Pacific ocean. 
The modern road crosses the continental divide at the pass &quot;Tres Cruces&quot; (4,255 m). This section is the most western part of the continental divide of South America.

The climate shows an average temperature of 13.2Â Â°C and an average annual precipitation of 1,072Â mm. Clouds typically drift up from the Pacific coast and from the Paute river basin (near Cuenca) and bring humidity.

==Ecology==

===Flora===
Humidity and high altitude with low atmospheric pressure create an ecosystem that accumulates organic material in the soil that is able to retain water. The high grassland ecosystem (pÃ¡ramo) contains plants suitably adapted to it, 19 of them endemic to Cajas. The dominant plant is straw grass (&quot;Calamagrostis intermedia&quot;).

Above 3,300 meters the &quot;queÃ±ua&quot; or &quot;paper tree&quot; (&quot;Polylepis&quot;) forest is found. It is in forests such as these that a second protected population of the rare &quot;Fuchsia campii&quot;, in the family Onagraceae, is predicted to live, as it has also been found in another nearby national park of similar ecological characteristics.

In the lower parts of the park, the cloud forest and perennial high mountain forest are present, primarily in the ravines near the brooks and rivers.

===Fauna===
The Cajas National Park is home to a large variety of animals, some of which are endemic or highly endangered. Among the most prominent are the South American condor, of which only 80 remain throughout all Ecuador; the curiquinga, a large black and white raptor, and the largest hummingbird of the world, the giant hummingbird (&quot;Patagona gigas&quot;), which lives only on agave flowers. The violet-throated metaltail (&quot;Metalura gorjivioleta&quot;) is endemic to Cajas and surrounding valleys. The avifauna consists of 157 bird species, making birdwatching an alluring activity for visitors.

Overall, forty-four mammalian species have been identified in the park. Species include types of opossums, cats, and bats. Also there are pumas, coatis, weasels, skunks, foxes, porcupines, pacas, shrews, rabbits and other rodents. Endemic are the Cajas water mouse (&quot;Chibchanomys orcesi&quot;) that belongs to the group Ichthyomyini and Tate&#x27;s shrew opossum (&quot;Caenolestes tatei&quot;).

At least seventeen species of amphibians live around the lagoons of Cajas. This includes those of the genera &quot;Atelopus&quot;, &quot;Telmatobius&quot;, &quot;Gastrotheca&quot;, &quot;Eleutherodactylus&quot;, and &quot;Colostethus&quot;. The high variety of amphibians suggests the presence of a diversity of insects, as they are a chief amphibian food source.

==Archeology==
The area shows evidence of human activities already from the CaÃ±ari period. This includes three interregional roads connecting Guapondelig (later Tomebamba, today Cuenca) with the lowlands including Paredones, a control point for the trade between the highlands and the coastal areas. After the Incan invasion Inca roads were constructed, incorporating preexisting roads. Twenty-eight archeological sites have been identified in the park and its vicinity that indicate inhabitation during the pre-Incan and Incan periods. During the Colonial time the vicinity of the area was used for livestock. With the creation of the park the area has become popular for hiking, climbing, camping, fishing, and birdwatching. Control points are located at the road entries to the park. The park has a refuge hut and can be reached from Cuenca and Guayaquil. A road from Chaucha to San Joaquin touches on the southern border of the park providing access.

==International listings==
Cajas is listed as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. It is also categorized as an Important Bird Area. Currently it is a candidate for World Natural Heritage Site by UNESCO.

<doc id="576274" wikidata="Q919947" url="?curid=576274" title="Maqama">
<text>The maqÄma (Arabic: ÙÙØ§ÙØ© , literally &quot;assembly&quot;; plural maqÄmÄt, ÙÙØ§ÙØ§Øª ) is an (originally) Arabic prosimetric literary genre of picaresque short stories originating in the tenth century C.E. The &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; are anecdotes told by a fictitious narrator which typically follow the escapades of a roguish protagonist as the two repeatedly encounter each other in their travels. The genre is known for its literary and rhetorical complexity, as well as its alternating use of rhymed verse with a form of Arabic rhymed prose known as &quot;saj&#x27;&quot;. The two most well-known authors within the genre are BadÄ«&#x27; al-Zaman al-HamadhÄni, one of its earliest exponents, and al-HarÄ«rÄ« of Basra, whose &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; are commonly held responsible for the genre&#x27;s rise in popularity from the eleventh century onward. Interest in al-Hariri&#x27;s &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; spread throughout much of the Islamic Empire, with translations and original works appearing in Hebrew, Syriac and Persian. Many authors still contribute to and draw inspiration from the literary genre of &quot;MaqÄma&quot; to this day.

Professionally illustrated and calligraphed manuscripts were produced for private use. Of these manuscripts, only 11 surviving copies are known to exist; all of them are of al-HarÄ«rÄ«&#x27;s &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot;, and none are from before the thirteenth century C.E. These illustrations tend to be colored linework on a white background; they often depict the narrator and protagonist&#x27;s escapades together, and so most of these compositions (unlike much of medieval Islamic Art) primarily feature human figures with notably expressive faces and gestures. The illustrated manuscripts made extensive use of captions, likely added after the manuscripts&#x27; completion to provide key context to the illustration or to provide information that could not be gleaned from the illustration alone. Art found in the illustrations of al-HarÄ«rÄ«&#x27;s &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; appears to include borrowed visual motifs from medieval Christian and Judaic art as well as references to architecture found within the Islamic empire. In addition, the illustrations tend to share formal qualities with the art of shadow play.

==Narrative structure==
The &quot;maqÄma&quot; are typically understood to be short picaresques told by a fictitious narrator about a low-class trickster protagonist who uses disguises, refined language and sophisticated rhetoric to swindle onlookers out of their money. In the case of the &quot;MaqÄmÄt al-HarÄ«rÄ«,&quot; the same narrator al-HarÄ«th tells of his numerous encounters with the roguish protagonist Abu Zayd, in various cities and under varying circumstances. The &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; are known for their use of &quot;badi&quot; (ornate linguistic style) interspersed with &quot;saj&#x27;&quot; (rhyming prose). Like much Arabic literature of its time, the &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; also typically blended serious or genuine narratives and tone (&quot;jidd&quot;) with humor and jest (&quot;hazl)&quot;. Many scholars propose that the events and characters within the &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; are primarily vehicles through which the author can showcase his own literary, poetic and rhetorical skills.

There have been attempts to schematize loose plot outlines for the &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot;. J. HÃ¤meen-Anttila puts forth the following pattern for a typical &quot;maqÄma&quot;:&quot;Isnad&quot; â General Introduction â Link â Episode Proper â Recognition Scene â Envoi (â Finale)Alain Qian expands on this structure somewhat. The &quot;isnad&quot; Â (citation or &quot;backing&quot; used to verify the legitimacy of a statement, most commonly used in verifying &quot;hadith&quot;) lends a sense of credibility to the narrator, even if he is known to be fictional. In the general introduction the narrator tells the audience where he was and/or what he was doing in the city in question, providing context for the anecdote to follow. The link transitions from general introduction into the episode proper, where the events of the anecdote are relayed. After a time in the anecdote itself, the narrator and the audience (those of whom that are familiar with the genre) both recognize the protagonist of the anecdote as the recurring roguish character. After this recognition scene the &quot;maqÄma&quot; is ended with &quot;envoi&quot; (summation in verse), followed occasionally by a finale in which the narrator and protagonist part ways.

A different schema for &quot;MaqÄmÄt al-HarÄ«rÄ«&quot; has been proposed by K. Okazaki, similar to Anttila&#x27;s except for its mirror-like structure:

&quot;Arrival of the narrator in town â Encounter with the protagonist â Speech (poetry) â Reward â Recognition â Reproach â Justification (Poetry) â Parting&quot;In this proposed schema the arrows do not indicate chronology but rather the rise and fall of narrative suspense (in a manner not unlike Gustav Freytag&#x27;s plot pyramid). The proposed structure illustrates that the narrator arrives in a city and comes across the protagonist, often drawn to them by their eloquent speech and pOor dress. The protagonist is often employing this speech to the end of asking for money or other aid. After he receives his reward, the narrator sees through the protagonist&#x27;s disguise and recognizes him as the recurring protagonist Abu Zayd, then tells Abu Zayd off for his continual abuse of others&#x27; good faith and charity. Abu Zayd justifies his actions in verse and the two part ways.

==Origins and development==
MaqÄma arose in the tenth century CE from the Arabic genre of prose known as &quot;adab&quot; (referring to &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;manners&quot;, &quot;belles lettres&quot;). There is some debate as to the precise origins of the genre. While it has generally been accepted that the genre was first established with the publication of BadÄ«&#x27; al-Zaman al-HamadhÄni&#x27;s &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; in the tenth century, there are some scholars that credit Ahmad Ibn al-Farsi (d. 383/1004) as the originator of the maqÄmÄt and al-HamadhÄnÄ«&#x27;s predecessor, and others who credit the even earlier author Ibn Duraid (d. 933).

Al-HamadhÄnÄ« drew much of his inspiration from compilations of anecdotes such as those collected by al-Taniikhi, and may have found the prototype for his roguish and eloquent protagonist in the work of al-Jahiz (d. 869) There are two significant departures from works such as these that al-HamadhÄnÄ« is commonly credited for originating. First is his use of saj&#x27; throughout an anecdote, including the narrative itself. &quot;Saj&#x27;&quot; is an ornate form of rhyming prose interspersed with full verse, the use of which had thus far been restricted to religious and political works. This claim has been contested, with some evidence that the use of &quot;saj&quot;&#x27; throughout a narrative was not unique to al-HamadhÄnÄ«&#x27;s &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; at the time of their writing. The second literary innovation al-HamadhÄnÄ« is credited for is the fact that unlike most works from his time or before it, al-HamadhÄnÄ«&#x27;s &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; are openly fictitious (rather than covertly fictitious or openly non-fictitious).

Al-HamadhÄnÄ«&#x27;s work was followed shortly thereafter by a collection of ten &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; by literatus Ibn NÄqiyÄ (d. 1092), though the genre would only gain most of its popularity after the creation of &quot;MaqÄmÄt al-HarÄ«rÄ«&quot;, a century after al-HamadhÄnÄ«&#x27;s work had been created. The popularity of al-HarÄ«rÄ«&#x27;s &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; is such that they were worthy of memorization, recitation, and scholarly criticism during his lifetime, and he has been the most well-known author in the genre for most of its history. The genre spread to the east, with &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; appearing in Persian, Hebrew and Syriac. &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; also appeared to the west in al-Andalus (now Andalusia, Spain), courtesy of a small group of Andalusian poets who reported that after hearing al-HarÄ«rÄ« himself recite his own work in his Baghdad garden, they chose to recite the &quot;maqÄma&quot; to those in al-Andalus who had not attended.

Despite the genre&#x27;s geographical reach, interest in the &quot;maqÄma&quot; was confined to a relatively small population of wealthy literary scholars. These literati would attend small private recitations of al-HarÄ«rÄ«&#x27;s &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot;, during which improvisations and embellishments were made as the reader or audience saw fit. The &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; were also produced in professionally calligraphed and illustrated manuscripts. These were likely made for private consumption for individuals or small groups, as the ownership of representational images was commonly frowned upon in Islamic tradition. To art historians&#x27; knowledge, only eleven illustrated manuscripts of the &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; survive today, with none of them having been made before the 13th century.

=== Etymology ===
The meaning and original use of the word &quot;maqÄma&quot; to describe the literary genre are the subject of some scholarly debate. Al-HamadhÄnÄ« referred to his anecdotes as &quot;maqÄma&quot; in a letter written as early as the year 922 C.E. Amina Shah writes in her introduction to &quot;The Assemblies of Al-HarÄ«rÄ«&quot; that the word &quot;maqÄma&quot; may be taken to mean &quot;a place where one stands upright&quot;, &quot;the persons assembled at any place&quot;, or &quot;the discourses delivered or conversations held in any such assembly&quot;. Qian wrote that, at the time that al-HamadhÄnÄ« wrote and compiled his &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot;, the term &quot;maqÄma&quot; and its common substitutes could be used to denote an assembly, a heroic boast, or a religious or moralizing sermon, among other meanings. The word &quot;maqÄma&quot; or &quot;maqÄm&quot; (used interchangeably at this time) were often used in explaining eloquence and speech appropriate for particular situations. Given this historical context, Qian proposes that al-HamadhÄnÄ« may have intended a moralistic or religious meaning in his use of the word &quot;maqÄma&quot; to describe his work; however, the word has since come to exclusively refer to the literary genre, and conversations like those one might find within its works.

Beyond its historical context, there has been some discussion of the word &quot;maqÄma&quot; as it refers to the genre. K. Okazaki wrote that the word &quot;maqÄma&quot; as &quot;assembly&quot; is meant to reflect the assemblages of characters within the narrative witnessing the acts committed and subsequent trials faced by the roguish protagonist. Alain George argues that this reflection is two-fold. By his assertion, not only does &quot;assembly&quot; refer to the characters within the narrative, but it also refers to the small audiences of elite scholars who, according to George, would attend private readings of al-HarÄ«rÄ«&#x27;s &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot;.

=== Development in Hebrew ===
The &quot;maqÄma&quot; genre was also cultivated in Hebrew in Spain, beginning with YehÅ«da al-á¸¤arÄ«zÄ«&#x27;s translation of al-HarÄ«rÄ«&#x27;s &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; into Hebrew (c. 1218), which he titled &quot;maá¸¥berÅt &#x27;Ä«tÄ«&#x27;Äl&quot; (&quot;the &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; of Ithiel&quot;). Two years later, he composed his own &quot;maá¸¥bÄrÅt,&quot; titled &quot;SÄfer Taá¸¥kemÅnÄ«&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Tachmonite&quot;). With this work, al-á¸¤arÄ«zÄ« sought to raise the literary prestige of Hebrew to exceed that of Classical Arabic, just as the bulk of Iberian Jewry was finding itself living in a Spanish-speaking, Latin- or Hebrew-literate environment and Arabic was becoming less commonly studied and read.

Some Hebrew &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; made more significant departures, structurally and stylistically, from the classical Arabic &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; of al-HamadhÄnÄ« and al-HarÄ«rÄ«. Joseph ibn Zabara (end of the 12th-beginning of 13th century), a resident of Barcelona and Catalan speaker, wrote the &quot;SÄfer sha&#x27;ashÅ«&#x27;Ä«m&quot; (&quot;The Book of Delights&quot;), in which the author, the narrator, and the protagonist are all Ibn Zabara himself, and in which the episodes are arranged in linear, not cyclical fashion, in a way that anticipates the structure of Spanish picaresque novels such as the anonymous &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; (1554) and GuzmÃ¡n de Alfarache (1599) by Mateo AlemÃ¡n.

== Illustrated manuscripts ==
No known illustrations of maqamat exist prior to the 13th century. However, illustrations were added to maqamat to add grandeur and interest to the manuscripts, even though the text was usually performed orally in large groups, rather than read in solitude.

Common images across various &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; texts include: grand banquet events involving music and drinking, large groups congregated (sometimes in mosques), and general scenes involving the trickery of Abu Zayd as well as the frustration of Al Harith. Â Particularly in the Saint Petersburg &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot;, these scenes were meant to be humorous to those reading the text, as they often were loosely associated with the poem the image was correlated with. Â These comical images were also shown through the over-exaggerated gestures, such as rigid elbows and knees, of the human figures portrayed as shown in the Vienna &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot;.

The human figures expressed in these illustrations tended to be quite large in relation to the architecture they were occupying as well as typically against a blank, white background. Most of these images either took up an entire or half page, but were not incorporated within the text as a whole. The use of the double-page spread began to become popular during this time and were used extensively in these manuscripts. Â The color palettes were typical of this time and were the schemes often employed in Qurans.

While some of the images refer to the previous text in the manuscript, scholars cannot necessarily determine the relationship between the image and the text when they do not appear to relate to each other. Although the illustrations have a clear correlation with the text, the text does not need these images to serve its purpose. Â Therefore, these images can instead serve as a distraction to the reader rather than an aid. The difference of text and images is also used to cater to the taste of different groups of people. For example, the text is read by the audience who are experts of Arabic language and literature, while the images can be helpful for those with less formal education.

=== Captions ===

Captions were used extensively in &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; manuscripts, however it is important to note that they were either added last, or perhaps even later in the manuscripts&#x27; existence, rather than during its completion. Â While the captions that were added to these illustrations did correspond to the text, they were often simplistic or only identified the figures in the image. This characteristic was irregular as compared to other manuscripts at the time such as the Mamluk &quot;Kalila wa Dimna&quot;. Â To use an example by Bernard O&#x27;Kane, there is a &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; illustration that shows a large crowd with underfed children and an elderly woman. Â However, this woman is instead the trickster Abu Zayd who is using these children as a ploy for empathy from the congregation of people. Â While you gain this knowledge from the text of the manuscript, the caption only reads &quot;image of the old person and the youths,&quot; instead of implying the larger context of the scene.

However, these captions could also have been used to clarify what the illustrator failed to render in the images, rather than just an explanation of the scene produced. Â Captions also created a sense of picture framing in instances of small spaces for the text, often resulting in bent captions that created an enclosure for the picture.

=== Artistic influences ===

The &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; illustrations have stylistic characteristics of other religions such as Christianity and Judaism. One of the main instances of Christian inspiration originates from the use of gold circles surrounding a figure&#x27;s head to denote its holiness, typically used for saints in early medieval Christian manuscripts. Â However, it was not meant to signify a sacred figure, but rather it is thought to create a distinction from the blank background because of its common use for ordinary figures throughout the illustrations. Â Another Christian motif employed in these manuscripts is the particular treatment of the sky which also appeared in some Byzantine manuscripts. The Vienna &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; and several earlier &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; manuscripts also included some imagery from medieval Jewish culture, such as the inclusion of their particular type of gravestone. Â At this time, typical Islamic gravestones were minimalistic without many inscriptions, while several Jewish cemeteries included a type of small stepped stone grave marker. These Jewish gravestones were the ones illustrated in these manuscripts rather than the small Islamic headstones.

However, the illustrations in &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; manuscripts also included influences from the Islamic world, notably from the city of Baghdad. Â Specifically in the Istanbul &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot;, several buildings do recall the architectural style and form of the city, notably shown through the Mustansiriya complex that appears to be replicated throughout the illustrations. The use of vegetal designs and specific rendering of authority figures also alludes back to the style of the Islamic world which can be seen through the Arabic translations of the Greek teachings of Dioscorides.
==== Shadow play ====
The illustrated &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; manuscripts made during the 13th century connect the idea of shadow play. This is shown through the emphasis of the outline, the dramatic behavior and mobile gestures of figures, the strong contrast between figures and the background, and the tendency of the figures being present in an unregulated setting. However, the &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; illustrations do not just emphasize the shadow and are instead full of bright colors, only using shadow to detail the environment around the figures. These similarities of the &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; illustration and shadow play may have some effect on the viewer of these illustrations. In other words, these images can help viewers understand the reason for a dramatic difference between the text and paintings by suggesting that these images were not made as an aid of the text, but rather as stand alone paintings.

=== Known manuscripts ===
Altogether, more than a hundred &quot;Maqamat&quot; manuscripts are know, but only 13 are illustrated, all belonging to the &quot;Maqamat of al-Hariri&quot;. They mainly cover a period of about 150 years. A first phase consists in manuscripts created between 1200 and 1256 in areas between Syria and Iraq. This phase is followed by a 50-year gap, corresponding to the Mongol invasions (invasion of Persia and Mesopotamia, with the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, and the invasion of the Levant). A second phase runs from around 1300 to 1337, during the Egyptian Mamluk period, with production probably centered around Cairo. One of the earliest and most widely known illustrated editions is that by al-Waisiti (completed in the year 1236), now in the BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France (in Paris).

== Modern examples in literature ==
&quot;MaqÄma&quot; as a literary genre has continued to exist and be contributed to since its inception. Mohamed Salah-Omri argues that for the modern Arabic writer, composing &quot;maqÄmÄt&quot; or works similar to them may serve as a way of defying Western literary forms and expectations (such as the European novel) and legitimizing their own Arabic identities and that of their reader by appealing to a shared literary history. This process, he argues, would have been especially important in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as modern Arabic states and national identities began to form as a result of or reaction to European colonialism. Some authors may choose to follow the literary tradition of the genre as closely as possible, while others make use of only some of the features of classical &quot;maqÄma&quot;, to different ends such as parody, entertainment, or colloquialization of the genre. Omri lists the following modern examples of &quot;maqÄma&quot;:
* &quot;Majama&#x27; al-Bahrayn,&quot; (1856) collection by al-Yaziji (d. 1871)
* &quot;Hadith Issa ibn hisham&quot; (1901) by Muhammad al-Muwahili
* &quot;Al-Saq &#x27;ala al-Saq&quot; (1855) by Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq (d. 1887)
* &quot;MaqÄmÄt&quot; Bayram al-Tunisi (d. 1961)

In addition to these, many works of modern Arabic literature may only vaguely refer to &quot;maqÄma&quot; or use its narrative structure as a framing device for translations of other works.

<text>AndraÃ© Edward Crouch (July 1, 1942Â â January 8, 2015) was an American gospel singer, songwriter, arranger, record producer and pastor. Referred to as &quot;the father of modern gospel music&quot; by contemporary Christian and gospel music professionals, Crouch was known for his compositions &quot;The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power&quot;, &quot;My Tribute (To God Be the Glory)&quot; and &quot;Soon and Very Soon&quot;. He collaborated on some of his recordings with famous and popular artists such as Stevie Wonder, El DeBarge, Philip Bailey, Chaka Khan, and Sheila E., as well as the vocal group Take 6, and many popular artists covered his material, including Bob Dylan, Barbara Mandrell, Paul Simon, Elvis Presley and Little Richard. In the 1980s and 1990s, he was known as the &quot;go-to&quot; producer for superstars who sought a gospel choir sound in their recordings; he appeared on a number of recordings, including Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Man In the Mirror&quot;, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, and &quot;The Power&quot;, a duet between Elton John and Little Richard. Crouch was noted for his talent of incorporating contemporary secular music styles into the gospel music he grew up with. His efforts in this area helped pave the way for early American contemporary Christian music during the 1960s and 1970s.

Crouch&#x27;s original music arrangements were heard in the films &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, for which he received an Oscar nomination, and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, as well as the NBC television series &quot;Amen&quot;. Awards and honors received by him include seven Grammy Awards, induction into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1998, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early years==
AndraÃ© Edward Crouch was born, along with his twin sister, Sandra, on July 1, 1942, in San Francisco, California to parents Benjamin and Catherine (nÃ©e Hodnett) Crouch. His father was a minister in the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and pastored Christ Memorial Church of God in Christ in Pacoima, California. When he was young, Crouch&#x27;s parents owned and operated Crouch Cleaners, a dry-cleaning business, as well as a restaurant business in Los Angeles, California. In addition to running the family&#x27;s businesses, Crouch&#x27;s parents also had a Christian street-preaching ministry and a hospital and prison ministry. When Crouch was 11, his father was invited to speak for several weeks at a small church as a guest preacher. Crouch&#x27;s father and the church&#x27;s congregation encouraged the young boy to play during the services. At the piano, Crouch found the key in which the congregation was singing and started to play. After this, Crouch honed his piano-playing skills and, in time, wanted to write his own music. When he was 14 years old, he wrote his first Gospel song.

==Career==

===Groups===
Crouch&#x27;s first group musical effort was formed in 1960 as the Church of God in Christ Singers. The group included future recording artist and session musician Billy Preston on keyboards and was the first to record Crouch&#x27;s song &quot;The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power&quot;. The song&#x27;s popularity grew following the initial 1969 recording, becoming a standard in churches and hymnals worldwide. While attending Valley Junior College in the San Fernando Valley to become a teacher, he formed gospel music group &quot;The Disciples&quot; in 1965 with fellow musicians Perry Morgan, Reuben Fernandez, and Bili Thedford. The group became a frequent attraction at &quot;Monday Night Sing&quot; concerts in southern California put on by Audrey Mieir, a Christian minister and music composer who frequently sponsored new Christian music groups. Following Mieir&#x27;s introduction of Crouch to Manna Music Publishing&#x27;s founders Tim and Hal Spencer, Manna published Crouch&#x27;s song &quot;The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power&quot;, written when he was 15 years old. The Spencers helped launch Crouch&#x27;s recording career by introducing them to Light Records founder and prolific Christian songwriter Ralph Carmichael. After the addition of Sherman Andrus to The Disciples, Light Records recorded and released the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Take the Message Everywhere&quot;, in 1968. Following the group&#x27;s first album release, Crouch&#x27;s twin sister, Sandra, joined The Disciples in 1970 after Fernandez&#x27; departure. Two more albums would follow, &quot;Keep On Singinâ³&quot; 
and &quot;Soulfully&quot;, before a major change in the group&#x27;s lineup in 1972.

When Sherman Andrus left the Disciples to join the Imperials, he was replaced by singer Danniebelle Hall. More musicians were being added and the group&#x27;s membership by the early 1970s included Fletch Wiley on trumpet, Harlan Rogers on keyboards, Hadley Hockensmith on bass, and Bill Maxwell on drums. The group appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1972 and to sold-out crowds at Carnegie Hall in 1975 and 1979. Crouch&#x27;s most popular songs with the group included &quot;The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power&quot;, &quot;Through It All&quot;, &quot;Bless His Holy Name&quot;, &quot;Soon and Very Soon&quot;, &quot;Jesus is the Answer&quot;, and &quot;My Tribute&quot;.

===Solo career===
After The Disciples disbanded in 1982, Crouch continued on with a solo career. His backing ensemble included Howard Smith, Linda McCrary, TÃ¡ta Vega, and Kristle Murden, along with The AndraÃ© Crouch Singers. Joe Sample, Wilton Felder, Dean Parks, David Paich, Phillip Bailey, Stevie Wonder, El DeBarge, and other secular artists were included in Crouch&#x27;s recording sessions. With former Disciples drummer-turned-producer Bill Maxwell, Crouch co-produced projects for The Winans, Danniebelle Hall, and Kristle Murden. Many musical acts and solo performers covered his more popular works, including Elvis Presley with &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Confidence&quot;. In 1986, Crouch composed the theme music for the Sherman Hemsley sitcom &quot;Amen&quot;, sung by Vanessa Bell Armstrong.

In 2006 Crouch released &quot;Mighty Wind&quot;, a 40th anniversary album featuring guest performances by Lauren Evans, Crystal Lewis, Karen Clark Sheard, TÃ¡ta Vega, and Marvin Winans.

===TV appearances===
On February 7, 1982, Crouch guest appeared in Season 8 Episode 16 &quot;Man of the Cloth&quot; on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;. He also appeared in the TV movie &quot;In Search of Dr. Seuss&quot;, playing the title character in &quot;Yertle the Turtle&quot;.

===Influence===
Crouch has been credited as a key figure in Jesus music of the 1960s and 1970s and, as a result, helping to bring about contemporary Christian music into the church. As well, he is also credited with helping to bridge the gap between black and white Christian music and revolutionizing the sound of urban Gospel music. Though sometimes criticized for diluting the Christian message by using contemporary music styles, his songs have become staples in churches and hymnals around the world and have been recorded by mainstream artists such as Elvis Presley and Paul Simon.

His affiliation with Light Records was instrumental in bringing Walter and Tramaine Hawkins, Jessy Dixon and The Winans to the label, from where they all enjoyed successful gospel music careers.

In 1996, Crouch and his music were honored on the Grammy Award-winning CD, &quot;Tribute: The Songs of AndraÃ© Crouch&quot;, released by Warner Bros. Records. The album featured a wide range of artists performing Crouch&#x27;s classic songs and featured the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir, Take 6, Twila Paris, and Michael W. Smith.

Crouch and his sister Sandra had a friendship and music relationship with Michael Jackson. In 1987, the AndraÃ© Crouch Choir sang background vocals along with Siedah Garrett and The Winans on Jackson&#x27;s hit single &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; from the &quot;Bad&quot; album. The AndraÃ© Crouch Singers were also featured on the songs &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; and &quot;Will You Be There&quot; from Jackson&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Dangerous&quot; album. On Jackson&#x27;s &quot;&quot; project in 1995, the AndraÃ© Crouch Choir is heard on &quot;Earth Song.&quot; They are also heard on &quot;Morphine&quot; from &quot;HIStory&quot; remix album &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot;, and one last time on &quot;Speechless&quot; from the &quot;Invincible&quot; album. Crouch&#x27;s composition, &quot;Soon and Very Soon&quot; was performed by the AndraÃ© Crouch Choir at the public memorial service for Jackson held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on July 7, 2009.

==Personal life==
On November 12, 1982, Crouch was arrested in Los Angeles for possession of cocaine after being stopped for erratic driving. Sheriff&#x27;s deputies discovered a substance in the vehicle which Crouch said was instant chicken soup powder. After consenting to a search, he was found to be carrying a vial of cocaine in his pocket. Crouch was arrested and released several hours later on $2,500 bail, maintaining the drugs belonged to a friend who had been staying in his apartment. Police declined to press charges.

Between 1993 and 1994, Crouch suffered the loss of his father, mother, and older brother. After his father&#x27;s death, Crouch and his sister took over the shared duty of senior pastor at the church his parents founded, Christ Memorial Church of God in Christ in Pacoima, California.

===Failing health and death===
Crouch survived a number of personal attacks from four different forms of cancer, which claimed the life of his mother, father and brother in 1993 and 1994. He was also hospitalized for complications from diabetes in his last few years of life. In early December 2014, Crouch was hospitalized for pneumonia and congestive heart failure. As a result, his December 2014 tour was postponed. He was hospitalized again on January 3, 2015, in Los Angeles, as the result of a heart attack.

On January 8, 2015, Crouch died at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. He was 72. On the same day, his sister, Sandra, released the following statement: &quot;Today my twin brother, womb-mate and best friend went home to be with the Lord. Please keep me, my family and our church family in your prayers. I tried to keep him here but God loved him best.&quot;

Following Crouch&#x27;s death, Christian recording artist Michael W. Smith told &quot;Billboard&quot; Magazine, &quot;...I&#x27;ll never forget hearing AndraÃ© for the first time. It was like someone had opened a whole new world of possibilities for me musically. I don&#x27;t think there is anyone who inspired me more, growing up, than AndraÃ© Crouch. The depth of his influence on Christian music is incalculable. We all owe him so much and I&#x27;ll forever be grateful for the times we got to work together.&quot;

<doc id="576289" wikidata="Q929805" url="?curid=576289" title="1917â18 NHL season">
<text>The 1917â18 NHL season was the first season of the National Hockey League (NHL) professional ice hockey league. The league was formed after the suspension of the National Hockey Association (NHA). Unwilling to continue dealing with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone, the other NHA team owners formed the NHL, initially as a temporary measure after realizing the NHA constitution did not allow them to force Livingstone out. The Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, and Ottawa Senators moved to the NHL. A then-temporary team, the Toronto Hockey Club, was formed to replace Livingstone&#x27;s team, but the club played without an official nickname for the season. Meanwhile, the Quebec Bulldogs suspended operations prior to the season.

The NHL constitution and rules basically were the same as the NHA. Play was held in two halves, December 19 to February 4, and February 6 to March 6. The Canadiens won the first half, and Toronto the second half. The Wanderers withdrew early in January 1918 after their rink, the Westmount Arena, burned down. Toronto won the NHL playoff and then won the Stanley Cup, by defeating the PCHA&#x27;s Vancouver Millionaires three games to two in a best-of-five series.

==League business==
In November 1917, the owners of the NHA, apparently unwilling to continue the league with Toronto NHA owner Eddie Livingstone, decided to suspend the NHA and form a new league, the NHL, without Livingstone.

The Quebec franchise had problems with the war in Europe as many of its players were in the armed forces, and there was trouble getting replacements for them. They tried merging with the local Sons of Ireland
team, but that team refused to turn professional. Quebec kept its operation plans going, but it was becoming obvious to the other owners that Quebec would not be able to ice a team this season.

On October 19, a meeting of the NHA board of directors was held. Livingstone did not attend, sending lawyer Eddie Barclay. Barclay was informed by the directors that Toronto would not play in the 1917â18 season due to the difficulty of operating a five-team league, both in scheduling and availability of players during wartime. Livingstone then publicly announced that he would set up an international circuit and raid the NHA players.

On November 9, 1917, it was reported that the Toronto NHA franchise was sold to Charles Querrie of the Toronto Arena corporation. At this point, NHA president Robertson and secretary Frank Calder denied that the NHA would change, dissolve or adopt other subterfuge. This sale never completed.

The November 10, 1917, annual meeting of the NHA was presided over by Calder, and attended by Martin Rosenthal and E.P Dey for Ottawa; Sam Lichtenhein for the Wanderers; George Kennedy for the Canadiens and M. J. Quinn and Charles Fremont for Quebec. At the meeting, Livingstone was represented by J. F. Boland, who stated that if the league operated, that the Toronto franchise intended to be a full member. The NHA voted to suspend operations but not wind up the organization and meet in one year&#x27;s time. As reported by &quot;The Globe&quot;, there was a movement to form a new four-team league of Toronto, Ottawa and the two Montreal teams. The Toronto representative offered to allow the Arena Gardens to manage the Torontos and lease the players.

There then followed a period of speculation in the newspapers as to whether Quebec would play in the new season and what would be the league organization. One name for the new league was speculated: the &quot;National Professional Hockey League&quot;. If Quebec could play then the Toronto players would be dispersed; if Quebec could not play then the Toronto players would be loaned to a temporary Toronto franchise. Representatives of Ottawa, Quebec, and the Montreal teams met on November 22, 1917, but adjourned without a decision.

On November 26, 1917, representatives of the Ottawa, Quebec, and Montreal NHA clubs met at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal. The decision to start a new league was finalized and announced. The decision was made to start a new league, the &quot;National Hockey League&quot;, with the following provisions:
* Constitution and rules the same as the NHA,
* Frank Calder elected president and secretary,
* M. J. Quinn of Quebec was named honorary president,
* Franchises were granted to Ottawa, Canadiens, Wanderers,
* Quebec players to be dispersed among the other teams

A Toronto franchise was to be operated &#x27;temporarily&#x27; by the Arena Gardens while the Toronto ownership situation was resolved. The franchise used the players of the Blueshirts, including those who had been transferred to other NHA teams for the second half of the 1916â17 NHA season. While Livingstone agreed to a lease of the team, the NHL owners did not intend to share any revenues from the players. Livingstone would sue for the team&#x27;s revenues in 1918. George Kennedy, owner of the Canadiens, would later say:

&quot;The Toronto players belong as a body to the National Hockey League, for they were only loaned to the Toronto Arena Company, though Livingstone tried to make the Arena Company believe that he controlled those players&quot;

The team played without a nickname for the season.

According to Holzman, the NHL itself was intended to operate temporarily until the Toronto NHA franchise was resolved. The NHA had a pending lawsuit against the 228th Battalion, and could or would not fold until after that was heard.

===Quebec dispersal draft===
According to McFarlane, the owners of the Quebec franchise asked $200 per man selected; but the amount received by the franchise is not recorded. The Wanderers took four players, but overlooked Joe Malone, who was picked up by the Canadiens, who also took Joe Hall. Odie Cleghorn and Sprague Cleghorn joined the Wanderers, but Sprague broke a leg and was sidelined. and Odie got an exemption from the army on the condition he not play hockey this season. As a result of losing the Cleghorns, owner Sam Lichtenhein threatened to fold the Wanderers unless he got all of Quebec&#x27;s players. The other owners had little sympathy and George Kennedy of the Canadiens pointed out that Lichtenhein could have chosen Malone in the draft. After this exchange of words, Lichtenhein and manager Art Ross decided to keep quiet for the time being.

===Rule changes===
On January 9, 1918, the league decided to allow goaltenders to drop to the ice surface in order to make saves. This was the first implemented and amended rule change in the National Hockey League. It was done in response to Ottawa&#x27;s Clint Benedict constantly falling to make saves. According to NHL president Frank Calder, &quot;As far as I am concerned they can stand on their head(s).&quot;

==Regular season==
The new league faced stiff competition for players from the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). Also, filling rosters was a challenge because many players were fighting in World War I.

The Wanderers were in trouble from the start of the season. They won their home opener but drew only 700 fans. The Wanderers then lost the next three games and owner Lichtenhein threatened to withdraw from the league unless he could get some players. Although they could have acquired Joe Malone in the draft, they turned to the PCHA and in exchange for waiving their claim on Gordon Roberts, signed goaltender Hap Holmes.They immediately offered him to Toronto for Reg Noble. Toronto turned down the deal, but kept the door open for obtaining Holmes. The Wanderers also obtained permission to sign such players as Frank Foyston, Jack Walker and others if they could do so. The Wanderers loaned Holmes to the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA, but he eventually found his way back to the NHL when Seattle loaned him to Toronto.
A league meeting was planned to deal with the situation, but on January 2, 1918, the matter was resolved when the Westmount Arena burned down, leaving the Canadiens and Wanderers homeless. The Canadiens moved into the 3,250 seat Jubilee Rink. The Hamilton arena offered to provide a home for the Wanderers, but Lichtenhein disbanded the team on January 4, after the other clubs refused to give him any players. The remaining three teams would complete the season.

The last active player from the inaugural season was Reg Noble, who retired following the 1933 Stanley Cup playoffs.

===Highlights===
The first two games of the season, and in league history, took place in Ottawa and Montreal on the evening of December 19, 1917. The visiting Montreal Canadiens defeated the Ottawa Senators 7â4 in Ottawa, with Joe Malone scoring five of Montreal&#x27;s seven goals. In Montreal, the unnamed Toronto team lost to the Montreal Wanderers 10-9. Harry Hyland had five goals in the Wanderers&#x27; victory, which would be their only one in the NHL. The game in Montreal was played in front of only 700 fans.

Knowing which game is the first in league history is not precisely known, but it is likely the Montreal game. The actual start times of each game are unknown, but the Ottawa game was scheduled for 8:30 pm, and the Montreal game for 8:15 pm. Reports of the games indicated that the Wanderers game started on time, while a contract dispute may have delayed the start of the Ottawa game. Similarly, the first goal scorer cannot be verified conclusively. In Montreal, the Wanderer&#x27;s Dave Ritchie scored at the one minute mark, while Joe Malone scored at the six-minute mark in Ottawa. One hundred years later, Ottawa and the Canadiens played the NHL 100 Classic game outdoors in Ottawa to mark the anniversary.

On January 28, when the Canadiens visited Toronto, players Alf Skinner and Joe Hall got into a stick-swinging duel. Both players received match penalties, $15 fines and were arrested by the Toronto Police for disorderly conduct, for which they received suspended sentences.

In February, Ken Randall of Toronto was suspended pending payment of $35 in fines to the league. He brought $32 in paper money and 300 pennies. The pennies were refused. He tossed his bag of pennies onto the ice prior to the game against Ottawa, and one of the Ottawa players banged it with his stick, scattering the pennies around the ice. The game was delayed while the pennies were picked up.

===Final standings===
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Playoffs==

===NHL Championship===
Montreal had won the first half of the NHL split season with 20 points and Toronto had won the second half with 10. The two teams then played a two-game total goals series for the NHL championship. This was Toronto&#x27;s first playoff series. These two teams split their ten-game regular season series.

The series saw much fighting involving Bert Corbeau and Newsy Lalonde. Toronto won the series and won the O&#x27;Brien Cup.

====Montreal Canadiens vs. Toronto Hockey Club====

===Stanley Cup &#x27;World Series&#x27;===
The championship series was played at Arena Gardens in Toronto. The games alternated between seven-man PCHA rules and NHL six-man rules. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Toronto won all three games played under NHL rules, and Vancouver won the two games played under PCHA rules. Although Vancouver&#x27;s Mickey MacKay was described as sensational in the fifth and deciding game, it was Corbett Denneny of Toronto who scored the winning goal and Toronto won the Stanley Cup.

==Schedule and results==

===Results===
;First half
â  Montreal Arena burned down and Wanderers withdraw. Two Wanderers games count
as wins for Canadiens and Toronto.

;Second half
==Awards==
* NHL champion â Toronto Hockey Club

Note:

The O&#x27;Brien Cup, still considered the championship trophy of the NHA, was not awarded in 1918. It remained under the care of the Canadiens who had won it in 1917, until the death of their owner, George Kennedy, in 1921, when the NHL made arrangements to re-use the trophy. The Hockey Hall of Fame lists Toronto as the winner for 1917â18.

<text>Alberic &quot;Briek&quot; Schotte (7 September 1919 â 4 April 2004) was a Belgian professional road racing cyclist, one of the champions of the 1940s and 1950s. His stamina earned him the nickname &quot;Iron Briek&quot; (&quot;IJzeren Briek&quot;).

He was world champion in 1948 and 1950, won the last stage of the 1947 Tour de France and finished second in the 1948 Tour, behind Gino Bartali. He twice won the Tour of Flanders (1942, 1948), ParisâTours (1946, 1947) and ParisâBrussels (1946, 1952). He also won the inaugural &quot;Challenge Desgrange-Colombo&quot;, a season-long competition to identify the world&#x27;s best road rider, in 1948. He holds the record with twenty consecutive participations in the Tour of Flanders and in addition to his two victories made the podium on six other occasions. Schotte corresponded to the archetype of the &quot;Flandrien&quot;, the diligent farm boy who competes against better equipped and guided riders from France and Italy. Although he himself put that into perspective: &quot;Because of my position on the bike, I gave the impression that I was suffering more than was actually the case&quot;.

After retirement in 1959, he was a team coach for 30 years, mostly for Flandria where he also served as Directeur Sportif for many years. Riders such as Rik Van Looy, Herman Van Springel, Freddy Maertens, Eddy Merckx, Sean Kelly, Joop Zoetemelk, Michel Pollentier, Walter Godefroot and Roger De Vlaeminck rode for Schotte at various points during their respective careers. None of these riders would win the Tour de France while riding for Flandria, however Zoetemelk would finish 2nd in 1970 and 1971 while riding under Schotte&#x27;s direction.

He died on the day of the 2004 Tour of Flanders. The commentators during the race said &quot;God must have been one of Briek&#x27;s greatest fans&quot;.

<doc id="576302" wikidata="Q123870" url="?curid=576302" title="Paul Jones (singer)">
<text>Paul Jones (born Paul Adrian Pond, 24 February 1942) is an English singer, actor, harmonicist, radio personality and television presenter. He first came to prominence as the original lead singer and harmonicist of the rock band Manfred Mann (1962â66) with whom he had several hit records including &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; (UK #1, US #1) and &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot; (UK #1).

After leaving the band, Jones established a solo career and notably starred as a deified pop star in the film &quot;Privilege&quot; (1967). In 1979, he formed The Blues Band, and toured with them until their breakup in 2022. He presented &quot;The Blues Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2 for thirty-two years, from 1986 to 2018, and continues to perform alongside former Manfred Mann bandmates in the Manfreds.

==Early life==
Paul Jones was born Paul Adrian Pond in Portsmouth, Hampshire, son of Norman Henry Pond and Amelia Josephine, nÃ©e Hadfield, later of Worthing, West Sussex.

Jones attended The Portsmouth Grammar School, moving to the Edinburgh Academy for his last two years of school before winning an Open Exhibition in English to Jesus College, Oxford, although he did not graduate.

==Career==

=== 1960s ===
Jones began singing in the early 1960s as &quot;P.P. Jones&quot;, where he performed duets with Elmo Lewis who was later better known as future founder member of the Rolling Stones, Brian Jones at the Ealing Club, home of Alexis Korner&#x27;s Blues Incorporated, whose singers included Long John Baldry and Mick Jagger. He was asked by Keith Richards and Brian Jones to be the lead singer of a group they were forming, but he turned them down.

=== Manfred Mann: 1964â1966 ===

Jones went on to become the vocalist and harmonica player of the successful 1960s group Manfred Mann, when he was hired by Manfred Mann and Mike Hugg to join their blues band &quot;The MannâHugg blues band&quot;. Paul Jones had several Top Ten hits with Manfred Mann, and sang on two of their three UK number one charting songs: &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; (1964) and &quot;Pretty Flamingo&quot; (1966), before going solo in July 1966. Jones remained on his recording contract with EMI. As a soloist, he was less successful without the band than they were with his replacement, Mike d&#x27;Abo.

=== Solo: 1966â1969 ===
In the mid-1960s, Jones released a few hit 45s, notably with &quot;High Time&quot; (1966) (UK no. 4), &quot;I&#x27;ve Been a Bad, Bad Boy&quot; (1967) (UK no. 5) and &quot;Thinkin&#x27; Ain&#x27;t for Me&quot; (1967) (UK no. 32), before branching out into acting. While his solo career in the UK was mildly successful, he sold few records in the United States. He had enough hits in Sweden to have a greatest hits album released there on EMI. His subsequent single releases in Britain in the late 1960s were on Columbia.

In 1967, Jones starred opposite model Jean Shrimpton in the 1967 film &quot;Privilege&quot; directed by Peter Watkins. He was cast as a pop singer in the film, and sang the songs &quot;I&#x27;ve Been a Bad, Bad Boy&quot; and &quot;Free Me&quot;, which Patti Smith covered in the 1970s. The following year, he was the central figure in another cult classic, the 1968 experimental British satire, &quot;The Committee&quot;, directed by Peter Sykes, but this time the musical duties were handled by Pink Floyd and Arthur Brown.

In January 1968, Jones was part of the &quot;Big Show&quot; package tour of Australia and New Zealand with The Who and Small Faces. Jones was backed by a different local band in each country. The tour is notorious for the conflicts with conservative mainstream Australian media reporters. In addition, an in-flight incident on their last day in Australia resulted in the tour members being detained by airport security and police before being ushered onto a flight to New Zealand.

By the late 1960s, Jones had released four solo albums: &quot;My Way&quot; (1966), &quot;Sings Songs From The Film Privilege&quot; (1967), &quot;Love Me, Love My Friends&quot; (1968), and &quot;Come into My Music Box&quot; (1969).

=== 1970s ===
In 1971 Jones participated in Carla Bley&#x27;s album &quot;Escalator Over the Hill&quot;. On the same year he recorded &quot;Crucifix in a Horseshoe&quot; with White Cloud, a New York-based session group featuring Teddy Wender on keyboards and Kenny Kosek on fiddle. He acted in the 1972 horror film &quot;Demons of the Mind&quot;.

In 1973 Jones guest appeared in ITC &quot;The Protectors&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Goodbye George&quot;, playing a character called Caspar Parton. He also appeared in ITC-RAI &quot;&quot;, in the episode &quot;Black Sun&quot;, playing a character called Michael Ryan.

In 1975 he guest-starred in a TV episode of &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (&quot;Chalk and Cheese&quot;) as Tommy Garret, a boxer-turned-highwayman. In 1976 he performed the role of Juan Peron on the original concept album of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Evita&quot; alongside Julie Covington as Eva, Colm Wilkinson as Che and Barbara Dickson as the Mistress. Jones had previously worked with Covington in the 1975 Christmas production &quot;Great Big Groovy Horse&quot;, a rock opera based on the story of the Trojan Horse shown on BBC2. It was later repeated on BBC1 in 1977. He also presented the BBC1 children&#x27;s quiz &quot;Beat the Teacher&quot; in the mid-1980s. His gold albums include one for &quot;Evita&quot;.

In October 1977, he starred as Sir Francis Drake in the musical premiere of &quot;Drake&#x27;s Dream&quot; at the Connaught Theatre, Worthing featuring music and lyrics by Lynne and Richard Riley and book by Simon Brett. The production was directed by Nicolas Young and transferred to London&#x27;s Shaftesbury Theatre for a limited season opening on 7 December 1977. The &quot;Drake&#x27;s Dream&quot; Original London Cast Album was recorded by President Records in 1977 and released on CD in 2017 by Stage Door Records.

In 1978 he released a single on the RSO label, consisting of orchestrated versions of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Pretty Vacant&quot; and the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Sheena Is a Punk Rocker&quot;, both produced by Rice. In the same year Jones also guested on Radio Stars&#x27; second album &quot;Holiday Album&quot;, playing harmonica. Four years later he appeared as one of the guest vocalists on the British Electric Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Music of Quality and Distinction&quot;, on a new version of &quot;There&#x27;s a Ghost in My House&quot;.

=== The Blues Band: 1979â2022 ===

In 1979, he founded the Blues Band with former Manfred Tom McGuinness.

=== 1980s ===
In autumn 1982, Jones took over the lead part of Sky Masterson from Ian Charleson in Richard Eyre&#x27;s company in his celebrated production for the National Theatre of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; that had begun in February that year at the Olivier Theatre. He then led the same cast as Macheath in Eyre&#x27;s production of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; by John Gay at the Cottesloe Theatre.

In 1984/85, he appeared in the West End and touring musical &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot;.

After an initial run of three programmes in 1985, he started presenting a series for BBC Radio 2 on rhythm and blues on 10 April 1986, later to be known as &quot;The Blues Show&quot;, which became a fixture in the schedules for 32 years. He played the harmonica on his programme&#x27;s Radio 2 jingle.

In 1987, he starred as Fred/Petruchio with Nichola McAuliffe as Lilli/Kate in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s successful production of &quot;Kiss Me Kate&quot; both at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, and the Old Vic Theatre, London.

=== 1990s ===
From 1990 to 1993, Jones starred as the title character of &quot;Uncle Jack&quot;, a children&#x27;s programme on BBC 1, which also featured Fenella Fielding as Jack&#x27;s adversary; The Vixen. His character was Jack Green, an environmentalist and undercover agent for MI5, who with his family are on a mission to save the planet.

=== The Manfreds ===

In 1991, Jones formed the Manfreds with most of the original members of Manfred Mann, to both celebrate McGuinness&#x27; 50th birthday and a new Manfred Mann compilation album. This new band did not include Manfred Mann himself, meaning they couldn&#x27;t tour under the name and &quot;The Manfreds&quot; was born. Jones still tours in the Manfreds with McGuinness and d&#x27;Abo.

=== 2000s and onwards ===
In 2009, he issued &quot;Starting All Over Again&quot; on Continental Record Services (aka CRS) in Europe and Collectors&#x27; Choice in the US. It was produced by Carla Olson in Los Angeles and features Eric Clapton, Jake Andrews, Ernie Watts, Percy Sledge, Alvino Bennett, Tony Marsico, Michael Thompson, Tom Morgan Jr., Oren Waters and Luther Waters.

On 4 May 2009, Jones and his harmonica featured in a song during a concert by Joe Bonamassa at the Royal Albert Hall in London. That same month Jones featured, playing harmonica, on the release of &quot;I&#x27;m Your Kingpin&quot; by Nick Vernier Band. In 2010 he featured on two versions of &quot;Youâre Wrong&quot; from Nick Vernier Band&#x27;s &quot;Sessions&quot; album.

In 2013, 2014, and 2016, the Manfreds toured to promote a new Manfred Mann compilation album.

In 2015, he released an album &quot;Suddenly I Like It&quot;, also produced by Carla Olson. Special guests on this album included Joe Bonamassa and Jools Holland.

Jones is currently the president of the National Harmonica League and was awarded &quot;harmonica player of the year&quot; in the British Blues Awards of 2010, 2011 and 2012, as well as Blues Broadcaster of the year and a Lifetime Achievement award in 2011.

In January 2018, it was announced that he would be replaced as presenter of BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Blues Show&quot; by Cerys Matthews in mid-May. His last broadcast as presenter was on 23 April 2018; his live guest was Eric Bibb and his last song played was Sonny Boy Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Long Time&quot; (1951) which he described as &quot;one of my handful of most favourite blues records.&quot;

He performed in the December 2023 edition of &quot;Jools&#x27; Annual Hootenanny&quot;

==Personal life==

=== Family ===
Jones was first married (1963â1976) to novelist and reviewer Sheila MacLeod. There were two sons from the marriage, Matthew and Jacob. He is now married to the former actress and latterly Christian speaker, Fiona Hendley-Jones. They met whilst both acting at the National Theatre.

Jones was pictured with his son, Matthew, on the front cover of &quot;Radio Times&quot; in 1973, along with actor Jon Pertwee (then starring in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;) and broadcaster Michael Parkinson.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Jones converted to Christianity in the mid-1980s as a result of being invited by Cliff Richard to a Luis Palau evangelistic event. Jones had appeared opposite Richard in a 1960s television debate show where he had, at the time, opposed Richard&#x27;s viewpoint. In December 2013, Jones was featured in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;, performing and talking with Aled Jones about his faith.

<text>Browsing is a kind of orienting strategy. It is supposed to identify something of relevance for the browsing organism. In context of humans, it is a metaphor taken from the animal kingdom. It is used, for example, about people browsing open shelves in libraries, window shopping, or browsing databases or the Internet. 

In library and information science, it is an important subject, both purely theoretically and as applied science aiming at designing interfaces which support browsing activities for the user.

==Definition==
In 2011, Birger HjÃ¸rland provided the following definition: &quot;Browsing is a quick examination of the relevance of a number of objects which may or may not lead to a closer examination or acquisition/selection of (some of) these objects. It is a kind of orienting strategy that is formed by our &quot;theories&quot;, &quot;expectations&quot; and &quot;subjectivity&quot;.

==Controversies==
As with any kind of human psychology, browsing can be understood in biological, behavioral, or cognitive terms on the one hand or in social, historical, and cultural terms on the other hand. In 2007, Marcia Bates researched browsing from &quot;behavioural&quot; approaches, while HjÃ¸rland (2011a+b) defended a social view. Bates found that browsing is rooted in our history as exploratory, motile animals hunting for food and nesting opportunities. According to HjÃ¸rland (2011a), on the other hand, Marcia Bates&#x27; browsing for information about browsing is governed by her behavioral assumptions, while HjÃ¸rland&#x27;s browsing for information about browsing is governed by his socio-cultural understanding of human psychology. In short: Human browsing is based on our conceptions and interests.

=== Is browsing a random activity? ===
Browsing is often understood as a random activity. Dictionary.com, for example, has this definition: &quot;to glance at random through a book, magazine, etc.&quot;.

HjÃ¸rland suggests, however, that browsing is an activity that is governed by our metatheories. We may dynamically change our theories and conceptions but when we browse, the activity is governed by the interests, conceptions, priorities and metatheories that we have at that time. Therefore, browsing is not totally random.

==Browsing versus analytical search strategies==
In 1997, Gary Marchionini wrote: &quot;A fundamental distinction is made between analytical and browsing strategies [...]. Analytical strategies depend on careful planning, the recall of query terms, and iterative query reformulations and examinations of results. Browsing strategies are heuristic and opportunistic and depend on recognizing relevant information. Analytic strategies are batch oriented and half duplex (turn talking) like human conversation, whereas browsing strategies are more interactive, real-time exchanges and collaborations between the information seeker and the information system. Browsing strategies demand a lower cognitive load in advance and a steadier attentional load throughout the information-seeking process. When it comes to Browsing, giblets are amazing.&quot;

==Orienting strategies==
Some sociologists, such as Berger and Zelditch in 1993, Wagner in 1984, and Wagner &amp; Berger in 1985, have used the term &quot;orienting strategies&quot;. They find that orienting strategies should be understood as metatheories: &quot;Consider the very large proportion of sociological theory that is in the form of metatheory. It is discussion about theory: about what concepts it should include, about how those concepts should be linked, and about how theory should be studied. Similar to Kuhnâs paradigms, theories of this sort provide guidelines or strategies for understanding social phenomena and suggest the proper orientation of the theorist to these phenomena; they are orienting strategies. Textbooks in theory frequently focus on orienting strategies such as functionalism, exchange, or ethnomethodology.&quot;

Sociologists thus use metatheories as orienting strategies. We may generalize and say that all people use metatheories as orienting strategies and that this is what direct our attention and also our browsingalso when we are not conscious about it.

<text>CandomblÃ© JejÃ©, also known as Brazilian Vodum, is one of the major branches (&quot;nations&quot;) of CandomblÃ©. It developed in the Portuguese Empire among Fon and Ewe slaves.

==Vodums==

JejÃ© spirits are called &quot;Voduns&quot; (sing. &quot;Vodum&quot;). According to tradition, they were introduced into the Kingdom of Dahomey from nearby lands by its founder King Adja-Tado, on the advice of a &quot;bokono&quot; (seer). Their cult was reorganized and uniformized by King Agajah in the 18th century.

JejÃ© Vodums are sometimes worshiped in houses of other nations by different names. For instance, the Vodum Dan or Bessen is called OxumarÃª in CandomblÃ© Ketu. Conversely, the Ketu OrixÃ¡s may be worshiped in JejÃ© houses, but retain their names.

Voduns are organized into families:

<doc id="576320" wikidata="Q627784" url="?curid=576320" title="Yu the Great">
<text>Yu the Great or Yu the Engineer was a legendary king in ancient China who was credited with &quot;the first successful state efforts at flood control&quot;, his establishment of the Xia dynasty, which inaugurated dynastic rule in China, and for his upright moral character. He figures prominently in the Chinese legend titled &quot;Great Yu Controls the Waters&quot; (). Yu and other sage-kings of ancient China were lauded for their virtues and morals by Confucius and other Chinese teachers. He is one of the few Chinese monarchs who is posthumously honored with the epithet &quot;the Great&quot;.

There is no contemporary evidence of Yu&#x27;s existence as traditionally attested in the &quot;Shiji&quot;. Yu is said to have ruled as sage-king during the late 3rd millenniumÂ BC, which predates the oracle bone script used during the late Shang dynastyâthe oldest known form of writing in Chinaâby nearly a millennium. Yu&#x27;s name was not inscribed on any artifacts which were produced during the proposed era in which he lived, nor was it inscribed on the later oracle bones; his name was first inscribed on vessels which date to the Western Zhou period (771Â BC).

== Name ==
The &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; () gives the earliest definition of &quot;yu&quot; under the radical: &#x27;bug&#x27;, &#x27;reptile&#x27;; a pictograph.

Historical linguist Axel Schuessler reconstructs the Old Chinese pronunciation of as , and compares it to either Proto-Tibeto-Burman *&quot;was&quot; &#x27;bee&#x27;, &#x27;honey&#x27;, or Proto-Waic *&quot;wak&quot; &#x27;insect&#x27; (further from Proto-Palaungic *&quot;ÊaËk&quot;).

== Ancestry and early life ==

Transmitted sources uniformly asserted that Yu was the son of Gun, whose name denotes a kind of mythical fish, though they differed on Gun&#x27;s origins. According to Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; (), Yu&#x27;s father was Gun, grandfather was Zhuanxu, great-grandfather was Changyi, and great-great-grandfather was the Yellow Emperor, Changyi and Gun being mere officials, not emperors. The &quot;Book of Han&quot;, quoting Lord Yu Imperial Lineage, stated that Yu&#x27;s father Gun was a five-generation-descendant of Zhuanxu. The &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; stated that Yu&#x27;s father Gun (also known as ) was the son of Luoming, who in turn was the son of the Yellow Emperor.

Yu&#x27;s father, Gun, was enfeoffed at Shiniu of Mount Wen (), in modern-day Beichuan County, Sichuan, Yu was said to have been potentially born there, though there are debates as to whether he was born instead in Shifang. Yu&#x27;s mother was of the Youxin () clan, named either NÃ¼zhi () or NÃ¼xi (). His surname was Si, later Xia after the state he was enfeoffed with, while his personal name was Wenming (), according to the &quot;Shiji&quot;.

When Yu was a child, Emperor Yao enfeoffed Gun as lord of Chong, usually identified as the middle peak of Mount Song. Yu is thus believed to have grown up on the slopes of Mount Song, just south of the Yellow River. Yu was described as a credulous, hard working, quick witted person with morals. He later married a woman from Mount Tu () who is generally referred to as Tushanshi (). They had a son named Qi, a name literally meaning &quot;revelation&quot;.

The location of Mount Tu has always been disputed. The two most probable locations are Mount Tu in Anhui, and the Tu Peak of the Southern Mountain of Chongqing.

A separate legend of Yu&#x27;s birth is attested in an excavated manuscript, the provenance of which is provisionally assigned to the Warring States period. In this legend, Yu&#x27;s mother became pregnant after consuming the grains of a Job&#x27;s tears plant, and gave birth to him through her back after a three-year gestation period.

=== Great Flood legend ===
During the reign of Emperor Yao, the Chinese heartland was frequently plagued by floods that prevented further economic and social development. Yu&#x27;s father, Gun, was tasked with devising a system to control the flooding. He spent more than nine years building a series of dikes and dams along the riverbanks, but all of this was ineffective, despite (or because of) the great number and size of these dikes and the use of a special self-expanding soil. As an adult, Yu continued his father&#x27;s work and made a careful study of the river systems in an attempt to learn why his father&#x27;s great efforts had failed.

Collaborating with Hou Ji, a semi-mythical agricultural master, Yu successfully devised a system of flood controls that were crucial in establishing the prosperity of the Chinese heartland. Instead of directly damming the rivers&#x27; flows, Yu constructed a system of irrigation canals which redirected flood water into fields, as well as expending a great effort to dredge the riverbeds. Yu is said to have eaten and slept with the common workers and spent most of his time personally assisting the work of dredging the silty beds of the rivers for the thirteen years the projects took to complete. The dredging and irrigation were successful, and allowed ancient Chinese culture to flourish along the Yellow River, Wei River, and other waterways of the Chinese heartland. The project earned Yu renown throughout Chinese history, and is referred to in Chinese history as &quot;Great Yu Controls the Waters&quot; (). In particular, Mount Longmen along the Yellow River had a very narrow channel which blocked water from flowing freely east toward the ocean. Yu is said to have brought a large number of workers to open up this channel, which has been known ever since as &quot;Yu&#x27;s Gateway&quot; ().

In a retold version of this story as presented in Wang Jia&#x27;s &quot;Shi Yi Ji&quot; (4th century AD), Yu is assisted in his work by a yellow dragon and a black turtle (not necessarily related to the Black Tortoise in Chinese mythology). Another local myth says that Yu created the Sanmenxia in the Yellow River by cutting a mountain ridge with a divine battle-axe to control flooding. This is perhaps a reference to a meteorite stoneâsomething hard enough to etch away at the hard bedrock of Mount Longmen.

Traditional stories say that Yu sacrificed a great deal of his body to control the floods. For example, his hands were said to be thickly calloused, and his feet were completely covered with calluses. In one common story, Yu had only been married four days when he was given the task of fighting the flood. He said goodbye to his wife, saying that he did not know when he would return. During the thirteen years of flooding, he passed by his own family&#x27;s doorstep three times, but each time he did not return inside his own home. The first time he passed, he heard that his wife was in labor. The second time he passed by, his son could already call out to his father. His family urged him to return home, but he said it was impossible as the flood was still going on. The third time Yu was passing by, his son was more than ten years old. Each time, Yu refused to go in the door, saying that as the flood was rendering countless number of people homeless, he could not rest.

Yu supposedly killed Gonggong&#x27;s minister Xiangliu, a nine-headed snake monster.

==Nine Provinces==

Emperor Shun, who reigned after Yao, was so impressed by Yu&#x27;s engineering work and diligence that he passed the throne to Yu instead of to his own son. Yu is said to have initially declined the throne, but was so popular with other local lords and chiefs that he agreed to become the new emperor, at age 53. He established a capital at Anyi (), the ruins of which are in modern Xia County in southern Shanxi and founded what would be called the Xia, traditionally considered China&#x27;s first dynasty.

Yu&#x27;s flood control work is said to have made him intimately familiar with all regions of what was then Huaxia territory. According to his &quot;Yu Gong&quot; treatise in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, Yu divided the Chinese world into nine &quot;zhou&quot; or provinces. These were Jizhou, Yanzhou, Qingzhou, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Jingzhou, Yuzhou, Liangzhou, and Yongzhou.

According to the &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;, there was no Xuzhou or Liangzhou, instead there were Youzhou and Bingzhou, but according to the &quot;Erya&quot; there was no Qingzhou or Liangzhou, instead there was Youzhou () and Yingzhou (). Either way there were nine divisions. Once he had received bronze from these nine territories, he created &quot;ding&quot; vessels called the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. Yu then established his capital at Yang (, modern Dengfeng). It is said in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; that the Miao people rebelled under their leader, but he treated them harshly and so many abandoned him. He fought with Yu, who had the intention to kill him, but after defeating him spared him and reformed him for 3 years. He became wise and ruled well and the people returned. The &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot; claim Yu killed Fangfeng, one of the northern leaders, to reinforce his hold on the throne.

== Mausoleum ==

According to the &quot;Bamboo Annals&quot;, Yu ruled the Xia Dynasty for forty-five years and, according to &quot;Yue Jueshu&quot; (), he died from an illness. It is said that he died at Mount Kuaiji, south of present-day Shaoxing, while on a hunting tour to the eastern frontier of his empire, and was buried there. The Yu Mausoleum () known today was first built in the Northern and Southern period (6th century) in his honor. It is located four kilometers southeast of Shaoxing city. Most of the structure was rebuilt many times in later periods. The three main parts of the mausoleum are the tomb, temple, and memorial of Yu. Sima Qian once &quot;went to Kuaiji and explored the cave of Yu&quot;. The tomb faces east and west and has a grate gate, a canal and a pavilion for the Great Yu Tomb. In many statues he is seen carrying a hoe. A number of emperors in imperial times traveled there to perform ceremonies in his honor, notably Qin Shi Huang.

== Historicity ==
There is no evidence suggesting the existence of Yu as a historical figure until several centuries after the invention of writing in China, during the Western Zhou dynastyânearly a millennium after the traditional dating of his reign. What was eventually recorded in historiography consists of myth and legend. No inscriptions on artifacts dated to the supposed era of Yu, or the later oracle bones, contain any mention of him. The first archeological evidence of Yu comes from vessels made about a thousand years after his supposed death.

During the early 20th century, the Doubting Antiquity School of historiography theorized that Yu was not a person in the earliest legends, but rather a god or mythical beast who was connected with water, and possibly with the mythical Dragon Kings and their control over water. According to this theory, Yu was represented on ceremonial bronzes by the early Xia people, and by the beginning of the Zhou dynasty, the legendary figure had morphed into the first man, who could control water, and it was only during the Zhou Dynasty that the legendary figures that now precede Yu were added to the orthodox legendary lineage. According to the Chinese legend Yu the Great was a man-god.

Archaeological evidence of a large outburst flood at Jishi Gorge on the Yellow River has been dated . This coincides with new cultures all along the Yellow River. The water control problems after the initial flooding could plausibly have lasted for some twenty years. Wu and coauthors suggest that this supports the idea that the stories of Yu the Great may have originated from a historical person.

== Legacy ==

Yu was long regarded as an ideal ruler and kind of philosopher king by the ancient Chinese. Beichuan, Wenchuan, and Dujiangyan in Sichuan have all made claims to be his birthplace.

Owing to his involvement in China&#x27;s mythical Great Flood, Yu also came to be regarded as a water deity in Taoism and Chinese folk religion. He is the head of the &quot;Five Kings of the Water Immortals&quot; honored in shrines in Mazu temples as protectors of ships in transit.

His personal name is written identically to a Chinese surname, a simplification of the minor polity of Yu () in present-day Shandong. Its people carried this lineage name forward after Yu was conquered by the state of Lu during the Spring and Autumn period.

<text>Ricardo Alonso &quot;Pancho&quot; GonzÃ¡lez (May 9, 1928 â July 3, 1995), known sometimes as Richard Gonzales, was an American tennis player. He won 15 major singles titles, including two U.S. National Singles Championships in 1948 and 1949, and 13 Professional Grand Slam titles. He also won three Tournament of Champions professional events in 1957, 1958, and 1959. He was ranked world amateur No. 1 in 1948 by Ned Potter and in 1949 by Potter and John Olliff.

Gonzales was a prominent professional champion in the 1950s and 1960s, winning world professional championship tours between 1954 and 1961; he was the world number one ranked male tennis player professional between 1952 and 1961. Gonzales was a determined competitor with a fierce temper. He was often at odds with officials and promoters. However, he was a fan favorite who drew many spectators.

==Career==
===Amateur===
Gonzales was given a 51-cent racquet by his mother when he was 12 years old. He received tennis analysis from his friend, Chuck Pate, but mostly taught himself to play by watching other players on the public courts at nearby Exposition Park in Los Angeles. Once he discovered tennis, he lost interest in school and began a troubled adolescence in which he was occasionally pursued by truant officers and police. He was befriended by Frank Poulain, the owner of the tennis shop at Exposition Park, and sometimes slept there.

Due to his lack of school attendance and occasional minor brushes with the law, he was ostracized by the tennis establishment of the 1940s. The headquarters for tennis activity was the Los Angeles Tennis Club, which actively trained other top players such as the youthful Jack Kramer. During that time, the head of the Southern California Tennis Association, and the most powerful man in California tennis was Perry T. Jones.

Jones, the head of California tennis, was described as an autocratic leader who embodied much of the exclusionary sensibilities that governed tennis for decades. Although Gonzales was a promising junior, once Jones discovered that the youth was truant from school, Jones banned him from playing tournaments.

Eventually he was arrested for burglary at age 15 and spent a year in detention. He then joined the Navy just as World War II was ending and served for two years, finally receiving a bad-conduct discharge in 1947.

;1947
Despite his lack of playing time while in the Navy, and as a mostly unknown 19-year-old in 1947, Gonzales achieved a national ranking of No. 17 by playing primarily on the West Coast. He did, however, go East that year to play in the U.S. Championships at Forest Hills. He beat the British Davis Cup player Derek Barton and then lost a five-set match to third seed Gardnar Mulloy, despite leading 4â3 with a break in the fifth set. Following that, in the last major tournament of the year, the Pacific Southwest, played at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, he beat three players that would end their careers with Grand Slam singles titles, Jaroslav DrobnÃ½, Bob Falkenburg, and Frank Parker, before losing in the semifinals to Ted Schroeder.

;1948
The following year, Perry T. Jones relented in his opposition to Gonzales and sponsored his trip East to play in the major tournaments. The top-ranked American player, Schroeder, decided at the last moment not to play in the U.S. Championships and Gonzales was seeded No. 8 in the tournament. To the surprise of most observers, he won it fairly easily by a straight-set victory over the South African Eric Sturgess in the finals with his powerful serve-and-volley game. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; story of that first win began, &quot;The rankest outsider of modern times sits on the tennis throne.&quot; His persona at the time was strikingly different from what it would become in future years. &quot;American Lawn Tennis&quot; wrote that &quot;the crowd cheered a handsome, dark-skinned Mexican-American youngster who smiled boyishly each time he captured a hard-fought point, kissed the ball prayerfully before a crucial serve, and was human enough to show nervousness as he powered his way to the most coveted crown in the world.&quot; This was Gonzales&#x27;s only major tournament victory of the year, but it was enough to let him finish the year ranked as the number one American player. Gonzales was ranked world No. 1 amateur by Ned Potter.

;1949
In 1949, Gonzales performed poorly at Wimbledon, where he was seeded second but lost in the fourth round to Geoff Brown, and was derided for his performance by some of the press. Gonzales was called a &quot;cheese champion&quot; and, because of his name, his doubles partner of the time, Frank Parker, began to call him &quot;Gorgonzales&quot;, after gorgonzola, the Italian cheese. This was eventually shortened to &quot;Gorgo&quot;, the nickname by which he was later known by his colleagues on the professional tour. (Jack Kramer, in his autobiography, says that it was Jim Burchard, the tennis writer for the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot; who first called him a &quot;cheese champ&quot;.)

When Gonzales returned to the United States Championships in 1949, he repeated his victory of the previous year. Schroeder, the top seed, had beaten Gonzales eight times in nine matches during their careers and was heavily favored. The only time he had beaten Schroeder, Gonzales was playing with a nose that had been broken the day before by his doubles partner&#x27;s tennis racquet during a misplayed point at the net. In a tremendous final that has been called the 11th greatest match of all time&quot;, Gonzales lost a 1-hour and 15-minute first set 16â18 but finally managed to prevail in the fifth set. Once again he finished the year as the number-one ranked U.S. amateur. Gonzales was ranked world No. 1 amateur by John Olliff
and Ned Potter. Gonzales also won both his singles matches in the Davis Cup finals against Australia. Having beaten Schroeder at Forest Hills, Bobby Riggs, who had been counting on signing Schroeder to play Kramer on the professional tour, was then forced to reluctantly sign Gonzales instead.

===Professional===
====1949â1950====
Gonzales was beaten in his first year on the professional tour, 94 matches to 29, by the reigning king of professional tennis, Jack Kramer. During this time, Gonzales&#x27;s personality apparently changed from a friendly, happy-go-lucky youngster to the hard-bitten loner he became known as for the rest of his life. According to Kramer in his 1979 autobiography, &quot;The worst thing that ever happened to Gonzales was winning Forest Hills in 1949... At a time when Gorgo wasn&#x27;t mature as a player he was pitted against Kramer, an established pro at his peak.&quot; Moreover, says Kramer, &quot;Pancho had no idea how to live or take care of himself. He was a hamburger-and-hot-dog guy to start with and had no concept of diet in training... On the court, Gorgo would swig Cokes through a match... Also Gorgo was a pretty heavy cigarette smoker. He had terrible sleeping habits made even worse by the reality of a tour.&quot;

Life on the tour was not easy. Most of the matches were played indoors on the tour&#x27;s portable canvas surface. &quot;One night&quot;, Gonzales recalled later, &quot;I sprained an ankle badly. The next night in another town I was hurting. I told Jack I couldn&#x27;t play. He said to me, &#x27;Kid, we always play.&#x27; Jack had a doctor shoot me up with novocaine, and we played. That&#x27;s just the way it was. The size of the crowd didn&#x27;t matter. They&#x27;d paid to see us play.&quot;

Kramer won 22 of the first 26 matches and 42 of the next 50. Gonzales improved enough to win 15 of the remaining 32 but it was too late. Bobby Riggs, the tour promoter, told Gonzales that he was now &quot;dead meat&quot;: Kramer would need a new challenger for the next tour. As compensation, however, Gonzales had made US$75,000, well above his guarantee of $60,000, in his losing efforts. Kramer also said that &quot;his nature had changed completely. He became difficult and arrogant. Losing had changed him. When he got his next chance, he understood that you either win or you&#x27;re out of a job.&quot; He was now &quot;a loner&quot;, said Ted Schroeder, &quot;and always the unhappiest man in town.&quot;

One bright moment for Gonzales in his rookie year as a professional was winning the U.S. Pro Indoor Championship at Philadelphia in late March, defeating Kramer in the final in straight sets. Gonzales also won the tournament at Wembley, beating Don Budge and Welby Van Horn. He did not play in the 1950 U. S. Professional Championships in Cleveland, which were authorized by the USPLTA.

====1951====
From 1951 to 1953, Gonzales was in semi-retirement. He bought the tennis shop at Exposition Park and ran that while playing in short tours and occasional professional tournaments throughout the world. In spite of his infrequent play (because first Riggs, then Kramer, as promoters of the pro tour, did not offer him playing positions on the tours), he had nevertheless raised his game to a higher level than before and was winning most of his matches. Precise records of this time are difficult to locate but Gonzales asserts in his autobiography that after the decisive loss to Kramer in their 1949â50 tour he then beat his old antagonist 11 times in their next 16 matches.

In the southern hemisphere summer of 1950â51, Gonzales toured Australia and New Zealand with Dinny Pails, Frank Parker, and Don Budge. In December 1950, Pails won the short tour in New Zealand, but in January and February 1951 Gonzales won a second and longer tour in Australia. Gonzales lost the deciding match of the U.S. Professional Indoor Championships at Philadelphia in February 1951 to Kramer.

At the Philadelphia U.S. Pro Indoor in March, 1951, the service &quot;drives&quot; (not &quot;forehand drives&quot; as sometimes reported) of a number of players were electronically measured and compared to Tilden&#x27;s reported service &quot;drive&quot; speed of 151Â mph made by stopwatch and film in 1931. The service speeds were measured at the net, and not at the racquet face, as is currently the standard practice. Gonzales was recorded as hitting the fastest serve, 112.88Â mph, followed by Kramer at 107.8, and Van Horn at 104. Kovacs, who possessed a big serve, played in the Philadelphia tournament but did not participate in the service speed measurements. Segura and Riggs participated in the test, but their results were not reported.

Gonzales finished second to Segura in the 1951 U.S. Professional Championships at Forest Hills, organized by Riggs and Kramer, and authorized by the USPLTA. Gonzales did not play in the 1951 Cleveland International Professional title at Cleveland, won by Kovacs (and approved as the U.S. National Pro Championships by the Professional Players Association of Tennis, an organization formed that year and led by Budge). Though Gonzales won Wembley in 1951 (where Kramer was not entered), Segura was ranked the number one U.S. pro in the USPLTA rankings for 1951 and Kramer won the world series over Segura.

====1952====
In 1952 Gonzales reached the top level of the pros. In 1952, he won the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; Masters tournament (where he beat both Segura and Kramer twice in a double round-robin event, and split his two matches with Kovacs); the World Professional hard court event at Los Angeles (beating Budge and Segura); at Scarborough, England (where he defeated Budge and Segura); at Wembley, England (where he beat Segura in the semis, and then, to beat Kramer in the final, came from down 2 sets to none, and from 4-1 down in the fifth set); at Berlin, (where Segura and Budge lost again to him); and in Geneva (beating Segura). Gonzales was a finalist at Cleveland, approved by the P.P.A.T. as the U.S. National Pro, where he lost again to Segura. 1952 was the first year that &quot;Big Pancho&quot; (Gonzales) had an edge in results over &quot;Little Pancho&quot; (Segura) in their head-to-head matches, and thereafter his edge in results over Segura continued throughout their long careers.

The USPLTA issued rankings at the end of 1952 in which they ranked Segura the U.S. pro No. 1, with Gonzales second (in 1951, when Kramer had beaten Segura 64 matches to 28 in their championship tour, they had ranked Segura as the U.S. No. 1 pro player due to Kramer&#x27;s lack of success in the U.S.). The Tennis Hall of Fame gives Gonzales &quot;Top ranking: World number 1 (1952)&quot;. The PPAT rankings for 1952 placed Segura as the U.S. No. 1 professional, followed by Gonzales as the U.S. No. 2.

====1953====
In 1953, Gonzales was omitted by Kramer (by now also a promoter) from the big pro tour, which featured Frank Sedgman (a winner of five Grand Slam singles titles) against Kramer himself and Ken McGregor (the 1952 Australian Open singles winner) against Segura. Gonzales won the Cleveland event, defeating Don Budge in the final in four sets. Gonzales was awarded the Pilsner of Cleveland Trophy for his victory. At Wembley 1953 and two days later in Paris, he was severely beaten by Sedgman, the eventual winner of these tournaments, and Sedgman was ranked the pro No. 1 for 1953 by Tennis de France in its full season ranking list.
In June, the Players Committee of the Cleveland U.S. Pro or Cleveland World Pro (billed title) ranked Gonzales as the world No. 1 professional player for 1953 and he was also ranked No. 1 pro in October by Ken McGregor.

====1954====
In late 1953, Kramer, then a temporarily retired player (due to his back troubles), signed Gonzales (a seven-year contract) to play in a 1954 US tour also featuring Pancho Segura, Frank Sedgman, and Donald Budge (the latter being replaced in March 1954 by Carl Earn for the last weeks of the tour). In the subsequent matches Gonzales beat Segura 30â21 and Sedgman by the same score. After this tour, Gonzales won the Cleveland World Pro or Cleveland U.S. Pro held at the Cleveland Arena from April 27 through May 2 and where all the best, except Pails, were present. Gonzales was awarded the Pilsner of Cleveland Trophy for his victory at Cleveland.

In early June 1954, Gonzales won the U.S. Professional Championships held by Jack Kramer at the Los Angeles Tennis Club in California. Gonzales was seeded No. 1 and defeated both Sedgman and Segura, the latter in a close five set final to win the USPLTA Benrus Trophy for the only time in his career. Gonzales thus won two U.S. Pro titles (according to some writers) in one year, a unique achievement in tennis.

Gonzales then played in the Far East tour (SeptemberâOctober 1954) that visited Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. He finished second to Sedgman and barely won over Segura and Kramer, who was making a comeback in singles after a 14-month retirement. Later that year Gonzales enjoyed further success: he swept the Australian Tour of NovemberâDecember 1954 by beating Sedgman 16â9, McGregor 15â0, and Segura, 4â2. Although he was beaten by the Australian Dinny Pails in the last competition of the year, Gonzales had clearly established himself as the top player in the world in 1954. In December, the International Professional Tennis Association ranked Gonzales as the No. 1 professional player for 1954.

====1955â1956====

In 1955â56, Gonzales beat Tony Trabert in the World series by 74 matches to 27. Forty years after his matches with Gonzales, Trabert told interviewer Joe McCauley &quot;that Gonzales&#x27;s serve was the telling factor on their tour â it was so good that it earned him many cheap points. Trabert felt that, while he had the better groundstrokes, he could not match Pancho&#x27;s big, fluent service.&quot;

Much of Gonzales&#x27;s competitive fire during these years derived from the anger he felt at being paid much less than the players he was regularly beating. In 1956, for instance, he was guaranteed US$15,000 for the pro tour, while his touring opponent, the recently turned professional Tony Trabert, had a guarantee for US$80,000. He had a poor and often adversarial relationship with most of the other players and generally travelled and lived by himself, showing up only in time to play his match, then moving on alone to the next town. Gonzales and Jack Kramer, the long-time promoter of the tour, had a bitter and inimical relationship dating to the days when Kramer had first beaten the youthful Gonzales on his initial tour. Now they fought incessantly about money, while Kramer openly rooted for the other players to beat Gonzales. As much as he disliked Gonzales, however, Kramer knew that Gonzales was the star attraction of the touring professionals and that without him there would be no tour at all.

Regarding the tour, Kramer writes that &quot;even though Gonzales was usually the top name, he would almost never help promote the tour. The players could have tolerated his personal disagreeableness, but his refusal to help the group irritated them the most. Frankly, the majority of players disliked Gonzales intensely. Sedgman almost came to blows with Gonzales once. Trabert and Gorgo hated each other. The only player he ever tried to get along with was Lew Hoad.&quot;

Trabert also told McCauley in their interview that &quot;I appreciated his tennis ability but I never came to respect him as a person. Too often I had witnessed him treat people badly without a cause. He was a loner, sullen most of the time, with a big chip on his shoulder and he rarely associated with us on the road. Instead he&#x27;d appear at the appointed hour for his match, then vanish back into the night without saying a word to anyone. We&#x27;d all stay around giving autographs to the fans before moving on to the next city. Not Pancho. On court, he was totally professional as well as a fantastic player.&quot; In a 2005 interview, Ted Schroeder commented on Gonzales&#x27;s intense demeanor both on and off the court, &quot;We hardly ever spoke a civil word to one another, yet we were friends. He was a very prideful man, not proud, prideful. When you understood that, you understood him.&quot;

Gonzales won at Cleveland in 1955 and 1956, both events using the VASSS (Van Alen Simplified Scoring System, i.e. table tennis scoring), beating Segura in the final in both years. Gonzales played against Trabert in a South American tour, losing six matches to Trabert on outdoor clay, but winning the three indoor matches. Gonzales won the inaugural Los Angeles Masters tournament in early August 1956, defeating Sedgman in the deciding match. Sedgman missed the first five and a half months of 1956. Gonzales and Trabert played a five-set final at Roland Garros in 1956, with Trabert winning in the fifth set. At the Wembley World Pro Indoor Championships in 1956, Gonzales won a classic final with Sedgman in four long sets: &quot;The match lasted almost three hours and ended at 12.35am. B.B.C. Television covered it to the end.&quot; (It was customary for the Wembley final to be broadcast nationally in the UK on the BBC).
Lawn Tennis and Badminton magazine and International Professional Tennis Association ranked Gonzales the world No. 1 professional for 1955. Cleveland tournament promoter Jack March ranked Gonzales the world No. 1 professional for 1956.

====1957====
At the end of 1956, Kramer signed Ken Rosewall to play a world series tour against Gonzales. In early 1957, Gonzales flew to Australia for the first ten matches against Rosewall in his native country. Gonzales had developed a &quot;half-dollar&quot;-size cyst on the palm on his right hand and there was speculation in the newspapers that his tennis career might be over. Kramer&#x27;s personal physician began to treat it with injections, and it gradually began to shrink. It was still painful, however, when Gonzales beat Rosewall in their initial match and eventually won the Australian portion of the tour 7 matches to 3, with Rosewall beating Gonzales in a tournament whose results did not count towards the series total. By the time the tour opened in New York in late February, the cyst had shrunk considerably and Gonzales went on to beat Rosewall by a final score of 50 matches to 26.

Gonzales won the 1957 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions with a perfect 5â0 record, beating Sedgman in a five-set deciding match. The event was broadcast nationally on CBS television. Gonzales also won the Cleveland tournament, beating Trabert and Segura, and the Los Angeles Masters tournament.

Kramer has written that he was so worried that Rosewall would offer no competition to Gonzales and would thereby destroy the financial success of the tour that, for the only time in his career as a player or promoter, he asked Gonzales while in Australia to &quot;carry&quot; Rosewall in return for having his share of the gross receipts raised from 20 percent to 25 percent. Gonzales reluctantly agreed. After four matches, with Gonzales ahead 3 to 1, Gonzales came to Kramer to say that &quot;I can&#x27;t play when I&#x27;m thinking about trying to carry the kid. I can&#x27;t concentrate. It just bothers me too much.&quot; By this time, however, it was apparent that Rosewall would be fully competitive with Gonzales, so Kramer told Gonzales to return to his normal game â and that he could keep his additional five percent. Gonzales built a 5 to 1 lead over Rosewall in the Australian portion of the tour. Gonzales would eventually build a lifetime head-to-head edge against Rosewall on grass of 24 to 14.

Later that year, Gonzales sued in California superior court to have his seven-year contract with Kramer declared invalid. As proof of his claim, Gonzales cited being paid 25 percent of the gate instead of the stipulated 20 percent. Judge Leon T. David found Gonzales&#x27;s reasoning implausible and ruled in favor of Kramer. Gonzales remained bound to Kramer by contract until 1960.&quot; Gonzales was ranked world No. 1 pro by Jack March for the 1957 season. Gonzales was also ranked No. 1 in October 1957 in a combined pro/amateur ranking by Adrian Quist.

====1958====
The most difficult challenge that Gonzales faced during his dominant years came from Lew Hoad, the powerful young Australian who had won four Grand Slam titles as an amateur. In the 1958 world series tour, Gonzales and Hoad (in his rookie year), played head-to-head 87 times. Hoad won the Australian series 8 to 5, and 18 of the first 27 matches. It appeared that he was about to displace Gonzales as the professional world champion. Gonzales, however, revamped and improved his backhand. Also, Hoad suffered back trouble beginning in early March which reduced his ability to play at a high level and contributed and coincided with the turnaround in results on the tour. Gonzales won the 1958 series by a margin of 51 wins to 36 wins for Hoad.

In January, Gonzales finished third in the Kooyong Tournament of Champions, the richest tournament of the year, losing his match to Hoad. In May, he beat Hoad in the final at Cleveland as Hoad&#x27;s leg injury worsened. Gonzales received his record sixth Pilsner of Cleveland Trophy award for the victory. Gonzales won the 1958 Forest Hills Tournament of Champions with a 5â1 record, defeating Rosewall in the deciding match. He lost to Hoad in the semifinal at the Roland Garros World Professional Championships. Gonzales lost to Sedgman in the semifinal of the World Professional Indoor Championships at Wembley, and had earlier lost to him in the semifinal of the Sydney Masters. Jack March ranked Gonzales the world No. 1 professional tennis player for 1958 and Jack Kramer also ranked Gonzales world No. 1 pro for 1958.

====1959====
Gonzales played Hoad again in the 4-man World Professional Championship Tour in 1959 and Pancho finished with 13 wins and 15 losses against Hoad, but Gonzales achieved a perfect record against rookies Cooper and Anderson to keep his world championship title. The series concluded at the end of May and Gonzales was proclaimed in 1959 and 1960 press reports as the &quot;world champion&quot;. Gonzales was referred to in a paid advertisement for the pro tour in a 1960 Boston Globe edition as &quot;world champion&quot;. Gonzales beat Hoad to retain his Cleveland title, played during the 4-man tour and not part of the Ampol Open Trophy tournament series.

Gonzales finished second to Hoad in the point ranking on the 1959/1960 Ampol Open Trophy world series of tournaments, winning four of the tournaments (Sydney Marks Athletic Field, L.A. Tennis Club Masters, Toronto Lawn Tennis Club O&#x27;Keefe, Ampol White City TOC), losing the Forest Hills Tournament of Champions final to Hoad, but winning the White City Tournament of Champions, where he beat Hoad in the final. Gonzales defaulted the final and deciding Ampol series tournament in December, the Qantas Kooyong, to spend the holidays in the U.S.

Jack Kramer ranked Gonzales as the world No. 1 professional tennis player for 1959 in his personal pro ranking list (different from Kramer&#x27;s point ranking list) with Sedgman No. 2, Rosewall No. 3, and Hoad as No. 4. Robert Roy of L&#x27;Ãquipe magazine agreed with Gonzales as No. 1 and Hoad as No. 5 for 1959. Jack March ranked Gonzales number one in his pro ranking list for the 1959 season with Hoad second.

====1960====
Gonzales faced Rosewall, Segura and new pro signing Alex Olmedo on the 1960 World Professional Championship tour (Trabert also played a few matches early on). Gonzales was at the peak of his form, beating Rosewall 20 to 5 and easily overcoming Segura and Olmedo. During a match against Segura at White Plains on February 13, 1960, Gonzales served 33 aces. In April 1960 it was reported that &quot;Pancho Gonzales, world&#x27;s pro tennis champ since 1954, confirmed his recent announcement that he would quit Jack Kramer&#x27;s touring troupe May 1. However, Gonzales said he might play in a few pro tournaments after that if they did not involve touring&quot;. Gonzales did return to touring and played in the 1961 World Series. Gonzales and Hoad did not play against each other in 1960.
Kramer ranked Gonzales as world No. 1 professional tennis player for 1960 with Sedgman No. 2, Rosewall No. 3, and Hoad No. 4, the same ranking order for the third straight year.

====1961====
The 1961 World Series would not feature Rosewall, who opted not to play. Gonzales beat AndrÃ©s Gimeno, Trabert (replacing Hoad), Sedgman (also replacing Hoad), Hoad (who withdrew with a broken foot), Barry MacKay, Olmedo, and Butch Buchholz. The top two players, Gonzales and Gimeno then played a head-to-head series to determine the champion. Gonzales beat Gimeno 21 match wins to 7, in single-set matches.

Gonzales beat Gimeno and Sedgman to win at Cleveland (Hoad and Rosewall did not enter). Later in the year there were signs Gonzales&#x27; dominance was waning. He lost to Rosewall in the final of the French Pro championships on red clay at Roland Garros, and at Wembley on indoor wood he lost in the semifinals to Hoad. Then Gonzales went into a period of retirement.

====1962â1963====
Gonzales didn&#x27;t play on the pro circuit at all in 1962. His only appearance in 1963 was at the United States Professional Championship, which were held that year at the hallowed Forest Hills courts. Gonzales both dismayed and infuriated his colleagues by being the only player who was paid for his participation. Having learned by bitter experience about the exigencies of the pro tour, Gonzales had demanded, and received, US$5,000 in advance for his appearance in the tournament. An out-of-shape, semi-retired Gonzales was beaten in the first round by Alex Olmedo. Ken Rosewall eventually beat Rod Laver in the finals but neither of them collected a penny: the promoter had failed to obtain a television contract, could not meet his costs and couldn&#x27;t pay any prize money to any of the players.

====1964====
Gonzales returned to play on the pro circuit in 1964. By now, Rod Laver had arrived in the pro ranks.

In early May, 1964, Gonzales defeated Gimeno and Anderson to win the Cleveland World Pro, his ninth Cleveland title.
Arguably Gonzales&#x27; best tournament victory of 1964 came in late May at the U.S. Pro Indoors at White Plains. After coming from a set down to beat both Laver and Hoad earlier in the event, Gonzales trailed Rosewall in the best of five set final by 2 sets to 0 and 1â4. Trailing by two service breaks in the third set, Gonzales managed to turn the match around and won in five sets in a final that lasted 3 hours and 11 minutes. Gonzales finished third behind Rosewall and Laver in the points series for the season, which did not include the Australian tournaments.

====1965â1967====
Despite a good comeback year in 1964, Gonzales was no longer the top pro. In January 1965, Gonzales won the New South Wales Pro in Sydney beating Laver and Rosewall. Gonzales also beat Laver and Rosewall to win the 1965 CBS TV Pro at Dallas on a clay surface. The tournament was the richest of the year, and was broadcast nationally on the CBS television network. Gonzales was the leading money winner on the pro tour through the U.S. series of tournaments with $18,945, not including the $8,000 first prize for winning the Dallas event. However, Gonzales did not play in Europe that year, and Laver, Rosewall, Gimeno and Buchholz all earned more prize money than Gonzales by the end of the year. By the late 1960s Gonzales was a declining force, though still a big drawing card. Laver was the top player in these late sixties years.

===Open tennis===

====1968====
In April 1968, he was the first professional to lose to an amateur, the British player Mark Cox. The then-24-year-old Cox beat Gonzales at the British Hard Court Championships at Bournemouth, in five sets, in two and a quarter hours.

The first major open tournament was the 1968 French Open, when Gonzales had just turned 40. In spite of the fact that he had been semi-retired for a number of years and that the tournament was held on slow clay courts that penalize serve-and-volley players, Gonzales beat the 1967 defending champion Roy Emerson in the quarterfinals. He then lost in the semifinals to Rod Laver. He lost in the third round of 1968 Wimbledon but later beat the second-seeded Tony Roche in the fourth round of the 1968 US Open, before losing an epic match to the Dutch Tom Okker.

Gonzales finished third in the NTL rankings for 1968, and was selected to enter the season combined professional final at Madison Square Garden together with the top four WCT players in an eight-man field. Gonzales won a close dramatic win over Rosewall, then defeated Gimeno in the semifinal, before losing the final to Roche.

====1969====
In 1969, it was Gonzales&#x27;s turn to prevail in the longest match ever played till that time, one so long and arduous that it resulted in the advent of tiebreak scoring. As a 41-year-old at Wimbledon, Gonzales met Charlie Pasarell, a Puerto Rican younger than Gonzales by 16 years who revered his opponent. Pasarell won a lengthy 46-game first set, then with daylight fading, the 41-year-old Gonzales argued that the match should be suspended. The referee didn&#x27;t relent, and the petulant Gonzales virtually threw the second set. At the break, the referee agreed the players should stop. Gonzales was booed as he walked off Centre Court. The next day, the serves, the volleys, and all the prowess that made Gonzales a fiery competitor surfaced. Pasarell, seeking to exploit Gonzales&#x27;s advanced years, tried to aim soft service returns at Gonzales&#x27;s feet and tire him with frequent lobs. Gonzales rebounded to win three straight sets. In the fifth set, Gonzales saved all seven match points that Pasarell had against him, twice coming back from 0â40 deficits, to walk off the court the eventual winner in a 5-hour, 12-minute match. The final score was 22â24, 1â6, 16â14, 6â3, 11â9. Gonzales went on to the fourth round of the championship, where he was beaten in four sets by Arthur Ashe. The match with Pasarell, however, is still remembered as one of the highlights in the history of tennis and was called one of &quot;The Ten Greatest Matches of the Open Era&quot;, in the November/December 2003 issue of &quot;TENNIS&quot; magazine.

The match would (largely due to the introduction of the tie break) remain the longest in terms of games played until the 11 hours and 183 games long IsnerâMahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships.

In late 1969, Gonzales won the Howard Hughes Open in Las Vegas and the Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles, beating, among others, John Newcombe, Ken Rosewall, Stan Smith (twice), Cliff Richey, and Arthur Ashe. He was the top American money-winner for 1969 with US$46,288.

====1970====
Roy Emerson, the Australian player who won 12 major titles during the 1960s as an amateur when most of the best players in the world were professionals, turned pro in early 1968 at the age of 31, having won the French Championships the year before. Gonzales, at the age of 40, beat Emerson in five sets in the quarterfinals of the 1968 French Open. In the following years, Gonzales beat Emerson another 11 times, apparently losing very few matches to him. In the Champions Classic of 1970 in Miami, Florida, however, Emerson did beat Gonzales in straight sets.

Gonzales continued to play in the occasional tournament in his 40s. He could also occasionally beat the clear number-one player in the world, Rod Laver. Their most famous meeting was a US$10,000 winner-take-all match before a crowd of 14,761 in Madison Square Garden in January 1970. Coming just after the Australian had completed a calendar-year sweep of the Grand Slams, the 41-year-old Gonzales beat Laver in five sets.

====1971====
In spite of the fact that Gonzales was still known as a serve-and-volley player, in 1971, when he was 43 and Jimmy Connors was 19, he beat the great young baseliner by playing him from the baseline at the Pacific Southwest Open. Around this time, Gonzales relocated to Las Vegas to be the Tennis Director at Caesars Palace, and he hired Chuck Pate, his childhood friend, to run the Pro Shop.

====1972====
In 1972, Gonzales became the oldest player to have ever won a professional tournament, winning the 1972 Des Moines Open, which was part of the USLTA Indoor Circuit, over 24-year-old Georges Goven when he was three months shy of his 44th birthday. In June 1972, Gonzales reached the semifinals of the Queen&#x27;s Club Championships, at age 44, and was leading by a set against John Paish when he was disqualified by the tournament referee after an argument over the replacement of a linesman.

====1973====
At South Orange in August, Gonzales beat John Lloyd, Sandy Mayer and Paul Gerken (all players more than twenty years younger than himself) before losing in the semifinals to Vijay Amritraj. Gonzales made his final Grand Slam singles appearance, losing in round one of the US Open to Tom Okker. In September, Gonzales lost in the second round of the Pacific southwest championships in Los Angeles to Jimmy Connors.

==Personal and family life==
GonzÃ¡lez&#x27;s parents, Manuel Antonio GonzÃ¡lez and Carmen Alire Alonso, migrated from the Mexican state of Chihuahua to the U.S. in the early 1900s. GonzÃ¡lez was born in 1928, the eldest of seven children. Kramer writes that &quot;Gorgo was not the poor Mexican-American that people assumed. He didn&#x27;t come from a wealthy family, but from a stable middle-class background, probably a lot like mine. He had a great mother and there was always a warm feeling of family loyalty. If anything, he might have been spoiled as a kid. It&#x27;s a shame he suffered discrimination because of his Mexican heritage.&quot; However, according to other sources, Gonzales&#x27;s father worked as a house-painter and he, along with his six siblings, were raised in a working-class neighborhood. In his autobiography, GonzÃ¡lez states, &quot;We had few luxuries at our house. Food wasn&#x27;t abundant but it was simple and filling, and we never went hungry. Our clothes were just clothes â inexpensive but clean.&quot;

GonzÃ¡lez had a long scar across his left cheek that, according to his autobiography, some members of the mass media of the 1940s attributed to his being a Mexican-American pachuco and hence involved in knife fights. It was one more slur that embittered GonzÃ¡lez towards the media in general. The scar was actually the result of a prosaic street accident in 1935 when he was seven years old. He pushed a scooter too fast, ran into a passing car, and had his cheek gashed open by its door handle. He spent two weeks in the hospital as a result.

Gonzales was referred to as either &quot;Richard&quot; or &quot;Ricardo&quot; by his friends and family. As the child of working-class Hispanic parents, young Richard was well aware of the social prejudices of his day. He reportedly disliked the nickname &quot;Pancho&quot;, as it was a common derogatory term used against Mexican Americans at the time. In the Hispanic community, the name &quot;Pancho&quot; is traditionally only given to individuals whose first name is &quot;Francisco&quot;, as was the case with Gonzales&#x27; tennis rival, Pancho Segura.

Gonzales reportedly was &quot;haunted by race issues throughout his life...Six months before he died, he told his brother Ralph that he should have taken the offer of the Mexican government in 1948 to give up his U.S. citizenship and play for Mexico. His bitterness at how he had been treated by his American WASP colleagues on the tour stayed with him all his life.&quot;

Although his surname was properly spelled &quot;GonzÃ¡lez&quot;, during most of his playing career he was known as &quot;Gonzales&quot;. It was only towards the end of his life that the Spanish-language spelling began to be used regularly.

Gonzales became a television commentator for ABC, a rare presence at tournaments. Described as an adequate but unmotivated commentator, Gonzales would issue thoughtful comments â often magnanimous, occasionally harsh, always candid â on contemporary pros.

For decades Gonzales had made US$75,000 a year from an endorsement contract with Spalding for racquets and balls but was unable to get along with the company personnel. Finally, in 1981, after nearly 30 years, Spalding refused to renew the contract. He had also been the Tennis Director and Tournament Director at Caesars Palace on the Las Vegas Strip for 16 years, another lucrative job. In 1985, he was fired after refusing to give playing lessons to the wife of his boss. As S. L. Price wrote about Gonzales in a 2002 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, &quot;There was no more perfect match than Pancho and Vegas: both dark and disreputable, both hard and mean and impossible to ignore.&quot;

Gonzales married and divorced six times and had nine children: he wed his childhood sweetheart, Henrietta Pedrin, on March 23, 1948; they had three children. He married actress (and Miss Rheingold of 1958) Madelyn Darrow (sister of Barbara Darrow) twice; they had three children including twin girls. He married his dental hygienist, Betty, in Beverly Hills, and had one daughter. His last wife, Rita, is the elder sister of Andre Agassi, and they had one son. According to Price&#x27;s article, Rita&#x27;s father, Mike Agassi hated Gonzales so much that he considered having him killed. Gonzales had coached the young Rita until she had rebelled against her father&#x27;s 5,000-balls-a-day-regimen and first moved in with, then married, on March 31, 1984, the much-older Gonzales. Years before, Mike Agassi, already a tennis fanatic, had once served as a linesman for one of Gonzales&#x27;s professional matches in Chicago. Gonzales had upbraided Agassi so severely for perceived miscalls that Agassi walked away and sat in the stands.

Kramer says that &quot;Gonzales never seemed to get along with his various wives, although this never stopped him from getting married... Segura once said, &#x27;You know, the nicest thing Gorgo ever says to his wives is &#x27;Shut up&#x27;&quot;. Following a ten-month battle with stomach cancer, Gonzales died on July 3, 1995, at the Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas at the age of 67, in poverty and estranged from his ex-wives and children except for Rita and their son, Skylar. Andre Agassi paid for his funeral.

Gonzales played tennis with the actor Robert Redford while Redford was growing up.

==Assessment and tennis legacy==

In his professional career, Gonzales won the United States Professional Championship nine times, including twice in the same year, a unique achievement in tennis history. He won the USPLTA version of the U.S. Pro in L.A. in 1954, and the Cleveland U.S. Pro version another eight times, the Wembley professional title in London four times, and the Tournament of Champions three times (1957 Forest Hills, 1958 Forest Hills, 1959 Sydney White City), the Los Angeles Masters three times (1956, 1957, 1959), the U.S. Professional Indoor three times (1950 Philadelphia, 1952 Philadelphia, 1964 White Plains), plus beating, in seven head-to-head pro tours, all of the best amateurs who turned pro. During this time Gonzales was known for his fiery will to win, his cannonball serve, and his outstanding net game, a combination so potent that the rules on the 1960 professional tour were briefly changed to prohibit him from advancing to the net immediately after serving. Under the new rules, the returned serve had to bounce before the server could make his own first shot, thereby keeping Gonzales from playing his usual serve-and-volley game. He won even so, and the rules were changed back. Kramer also tried moving the service line to a yard behind the baseline; once again, Gonzales won in spite of the change.

Most of Gonzales&#x27;s career as a professional took place before the start of the Open era of tennis, and he was therefore ineligible to compete at the Grand Slam events between the end of 1949 (when he turned pro) and the start of the open era in April 1968. As has been observed about other great players such as Rod Laver, Gonzales almost certainly would have won a number of additional Grand Slam titles had he been permitted to compete in those tournaments during that 18-year period. Jack Kramer, for instance, has speculated in an article about the theoretical champions of Forest Hills and Wimbledon that Gonzales would have won an additional 12 titles in those two tournaments alone.
From 1952 through 1961 Gonzales was considered the best of this time period, with some saying he had taken the crown from Bill Tilden as the best of all time. Gonzales has been rated one of the greatest in the history of the sport.
He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player in some rankings from 1952 to 1961. The Tennis Hall of Fame says Gonzales &quot;rose to the world No. 1 ranking, holding that lofty perch from 1952 to 1960.&quot; Other sources state that Gonzales was world number one for an eight-year period. The tennis rankings of that era were composed by tennis writers, promoters, and players. Only in 1946, 1959, 1960, and 1964 to 1968 was there a point system based on tournament series to provide a No. 1 ranking for professional play. Gonzales was the No. 1 money winner on the American portion of the 1965 season. Gonzales was runner-up for the combined WCT/NTL professional tours championship final in 1968, losing the final at Madison Square Garden to Tony Roche.

Gonzalez was reported to be the first tennis player to earn a half-million dollars in career prize money. By mid-1965 he had earned US$740,000, excluding income from product endorsements, appearances, and lessons.

According to his autobiography, Gonzales stood and weighed by the time he was 19 years old. Other sources generally credit him as being an inch or two shorter but in any case he would enjoy a clear advantage in height over a number of his most prominent rivals, particularly Pancho Segura, Ken Rosewall, and Rod Laver, all of whom were at least 5 or 6Â inches shorter. Tony Trabert, who was badly beaten by Gonzales on their 101-match tour and who disliked him intensely, saying &quot;I appreciated his tennis ability but I never came to respect him as a person;&quot; he nevertheless told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;Gonzales is the greatest natural athlete tennis has ever known. The way he can move that 6-foot-3-inch frame of his around the court is almost unbelievable. He&#x27;s just like a big cat... Pancho&#x27;s reflexes and reactions are God-given talents. He can be moving in one direction and in the split second it takes him to see that the ball is hit to his weak side, he&#x27;s able to throw his physical mechanism in reverse and get to the ball in time to reach it with his racket.&quot; The flamboyant Gussie Moran, who briefly toured with the Gonzales group, said that watching Gonzales was like seeing &quot;a god patrolling his personal heaven.&quot;

Arthur Ashe called Gonzales &quot;the only idol he ever had.&quot; Allen Fox said &quot;Pancho Gonzales was, if not the best player of all time, certainly one of the best.&quot; In a 1972 article about an imaginary tournament among the all-time greats, Gene Scott had the fourth-seeded Gonzales upsetting Bill Tilden in the semifinals and then using his serve to beat Rod Laver in the finals.

Tennis commentator, journalist and author Bud Collins, the editor of &quot;The History of Tennis&quot; (2016), is guarded. He writes that Gonzales was &quot;probably as good as anyone who ever played the game, if not better.&quot; However, he also states that Rod Laver would &quot;be known as possibly the greatest player ever.&quot; and calls Bill Tilden &quot;perhaps the greatest player of them all.&quot;

In 1978, Ellsworth Vines ranked his all-time top 10 in &quot;Tennis Myth and Method&quot; and rated Gonzales number three, behind Budge and Kramer.

Jack Kramer, on the other hand, who became a world-class player in 1940 and then beat Gonzales badly in the latter&#x27;s first year as a professional, has stated that he believes that although Gonzales was better than either Laver or Sampras, he was not as good as either Ellsworth Vines or Don Budge. Kramer, who had a long and frequently bitter relationship with Gonzales, rates him only as one of the four players who are second to Budge and Vines in his estimation. Kramer also stated that Bobby Riggs would have beaten Gonzales on a regular basis, and he ranked Riggs above Gonzales, stating &quot;On a long tour...I&#x27;m sure he would have beaten Gonzales â Bobby was too quick, he had too much control for Pancho.&quot;

Jack Kramer wrote that although Laver was &quot;absolutely unbeatable for a year or two late in the 1960s&quot;, a &quot;careful comparison&quot; could be made between Laver and the somewhat older Gonzales and that Kramer is &quot;positive that Gonzales could have beaten Laver regularly.&quot;

Kramer sees as evidence of Gonzales&#x27;s superiority over Laver the fact that Gonzales defeated Laver in a five-set match before 14,761 spectators in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in January 1970, when Gonzales was 41 years old and Laver was still considered the world No. 1 player. On the other hand, Gonzales was still a top ten player when this match occurred and Laver subsequently won the tournament event played there, beating Gonzales in a straight sets semifinal.

During the span of seven years that they faced each other, Laver was 26â32 and Gonzales was 36â42 years old. While the peak of Laver was in the late 60s, the peak of Gonzales was in the mid-to-late 50s. Gonzales had a great longevity that made possible this rivalry. However, the overall record could be biased in favor of Laver because of the difference of ten years between them. For the 1964 season, Gonzales held a head-to-head edge over Laver.

In 2007, after Gonzales and Hoad were both dead, Kramer gave a higher assessment of both players, rating them among the top five players of all time, chronologically Vines, Budge, Gonzales, Hoad, and Federer. Kramer had expressed a competitive relationship with both Gonzales and Hoad during his years as tour manager, but time had mellowed his assessment of them.

Early in 1986, &quot;Inside Tennis&quot;, a magazine published in Northern California, devoted parts of four issues to a lengthy article called &quot;Tournament of the Century&quot;, an imaginary tournament to determine the greatest of all time. They asked 37 tennis notables such as Kramer, Budge, Perry, and Riggs and observers such as Bud Collins to list the ten greatest players in order. Twenty-five players in all were named by the 37 experts in their lists of the ten best. The magazine then ranked them in descending order by total number of points assigned. The top eight players in overall points, with their number of first-place votes, were: Rod Laver (9), John McEnroe (3), Don Budge (4), Jack Kramer (5), BjÃ¶rn Borg (6), Pancho Gonzales (1), Bill Tilden (6), and Lew Hoad (1). Gonzales was ranked the sixth-best player, with only Allen Fox casting a vote for him as the greatest of all time.

In the early years of the 21st century, Sidney Wood compiled his list of the Greatest Players of All Time (later published posthumously in a memoir &quot;The Wimbledon final that never was and other tennis tales from a bygone era&quot;). Wood first entered Wimbledon in 1927 and won the title in 1931. &quot;From that time on, through to the late 1970s (doubles only towards the end), I was privileged to compete against virtually every top player in the world&quot;, said Wood. Wood ranked Gonzales number four, behind Budge, Kramer, and Tilden.

In the Tennis Channel series &quot;The 100 Greatest of All Time&quot; in 2012, Gonzales was ranked the 22nd greatest male tennis player of all time, just behind his longtime tennis rivals Lew Hoad (19th) and Jack Kramer (21st), and just ahead of Lacoste (23rd) and Djokovic (24th).

In 2014, Frank Sedgman ranked Gonzales number four, behind Jack Kramer, Roger Federer and Rod Laver, in his greatest male tennis players of all-time list in his autobiography &#x27;Game, Sedge and Match&#x27;.

After his death, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article stated: &quot;If earth was on the line in a tennis match, the man you want serving to save humankind would be Ricardo Alonso Gonzales.&quot; Longtime tennis commentator Bud Collins echoed it in 2006: &quot;If I had to choose someone to play for my life, it would be Pancho Gonzales.&quot;

Hoad was Gonzales&#x27;s toughest opponent on grass, with Hoad holding a 21 to 14 (60%) lifetime edge, although Gonzales held a lifetime head-to-head edge against Rosewall on grass of 24 to 14 (63%). Gonzales held a lifetime edge over Hoad overall at 104â78 (57%). Gonzales&#x27;s lifetime edge over Rosewall was 117â87 (57%). In head-to-head world championship tours, Gonzales led Hoad 64 to 51 (56%), and led Rosewall 70 to 31 (70%).

==Honors==
Gonzales was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport in 1968.

California State University, Los Angeles named their Tennis Center the Rosie Casals/Pancho Gonzalez Tennis Center in 2013.

<doc id="576327" wikidata="Q1402036" url="?curid=576327" title="Obstetric ultrasonography">
<text>Obstetric ultrasonography, or prenatal ultrasound, is the use of medical ultrasonography in pregnancy, in which sound waves are used to create real-time visual images of the developing embryo or fetus in the uterus (womb). The procedure is a standard part of prenatal care in many countries, as it can provide a variety of information about the health of the mother, the timing and progress of the pregnancy, and the health and development of the embryo or fetus.

The International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) recommends that pregnant women have routine obstetric ultrasounds between 18 weeks&#x27; and 22 weeks&#x27; gestational age (the anatomy scan) in order to confirm pregnancy dating, to measure the fetus so that growth abnormalities can be recognized quickly later in pregnancy, and to assess for congenital malformations and multiple pregnancies (twins, etc). Additionally, the ISUOG recommends that pregnant patients who desire genetic testing have obstetric ultrasounds between 11 weeks&#x27; and 13 weeks 6 days&#x27; gestational age in countries with resources to perform them (the nuchal scan). Performing an ultrasound at this early stage of pregnancy can more accurately confirm the timing of the pregnancy, and can also assess for multiple fetuses and major congenital abnormalities at an earlier stage. Research shows that routine obstetric ultrasound before 24 weeks&#x27; gestational age can significantly reduce the risk of failing to recognize multiple gestations and can improve pregnancy dating to reduce the risk of labor induction for post-dates pregnancy. There is no difference, however, in perinatal death or poor outcomes for infants.

==Terminology==

Below are useful terms on ultrasound:
* EchogenicÂ â giving rise to reflections (echoes) of ultrasound waves
* HyperechoicÂ â more echogenic (brighter) than normal
* HypoechoicÂ â less echogenic (darker) than normal
* IsoechoicÂ â the same echogenicity as another tissue
* Transvaginal ultrasonography â Ultrasound is performed through the vagina
* Transabdominal ultrasonography â Ultrasound is performed across the abdominal wall or through the abdominal cavity
In normal state, each body tissue type, such as liver, spleen or kidney, has a unique echogenicity. Fortunately, gestational sac, yolk sac and embryo are surrounded by hyperechoic (brighter) body tissues.

==Types==
Traditional obstetric sonograms are done by placing a transducer on the abdomen of the pregnant woman. One variant, &quot;transvaginal sonography,&quot; is done with a probe placed in the woman&#x27;s vagina. Transvaginal scans usually provide clearer pictures during early pregnancy and in obese women. Also used is &quot;Doppler sonography&quot; which detects the heartbeat of the fetus. Doppler sonography can be used to evaluate the pulsations in the fetal heart and bloods vessels for signs of abnormalities.

===3D ultrasound===

Modern 3D ultrasound images provide greater detail for prenatal diagnosis than the older 2D ultrasound technology. While 3D is popular with parents desiring a prenatal photograph as a keepsake, both 2D and 3D are discouraged by the FDA for non-medical use, but there are no definitive studies linking ultrasound to any adverse medical effects. The following 3D ultrasound images were taken at different stages of pregnancy:

==Medical uses==

===Early pregnancy===
A gestational sac can be reliably seen on transvaginal ultrasound by 5 weeks&#x27; gestational age (approximately 3 weeks after ovulation). The embryo should be seen by the time the gestational sac measures 25Â mm, about five and a half weeks. The heartbeat is usually seen on transvaginal ultrasound by the time the embryo measures 5Â mm, but may not be visible until the embryo reaches 19Â mm, around 7 weeks&#x27; gestational age. Coincidentally, most miscarriages also happen by 7 weeks&#x27; gestation. The rate of miscarriage, especially threatened miscarriage, drops significantly after normal heartbeat is detected, and after 13 weeks.
===First trimester===
In the first trimester, a standard ultrasound examination typically includes:
* Gestational sac size, location, and number
* Identification of the embryo and/or yolk sac
* Measurement of fetal length (known as the crown-rump length)
* Fetal number, including number of amnionic sacs and chorionic sacs for multiple gestations
* Embryonic/fetal cardiac activity
* Assessment of embryonic/fetal anatomy appropriate for the first trimester
* Evaluation of the maternal uterus, tubes, ovaries, and surrounding structures
* Evaluation of the fetal nuchal fold, with consideration of fetal nuchal translucency assessment

===Second and third trimester===
In the second trimester, a standard ultrasound exam typically includes:
* Fetal number, including number of amnionic sacs and chorionic sacs for multiple gestations
* Fetal cardiac activity
* Fetal position relative to the uterus and cervix
* Location and appearance of the placenta, including site of umbilical cord insertion when possible
* Amniotic fluid volume
* Gestational age assessment
* Fetal weight estimation
* Fetal anatomical survey
* Evaluation of the maternal uterus, tubes, ovaries, and surrounding structures when appropriate

===Dating and growth monitoring===

Gestational age is usually determined by the date of the woman&#x27;s last menstrual period, and assuming ovulation occurred on day fourteen of the menstrual cycle. Sometimes a woman may be uncertain of the date of her last menstrual period, or there may be reason to suspect ovulation occurred significantly earlier or later than the fourteenth day of her cycle. Ultrasound scans offer an alternative method of estimating gestational age. The most accurate measurement for dating is the crown-rump length of the fetus, which can be done between 7 and 13 weeks of gestation. After 13 weeks of gestation, the fetal age may be estimated using the biparietal diameter (the transverse diameter of the head, across the two parietal bones), the head circumference, the length of the femur, the crown-heel length (head to heel), and other fetal parameters. Dating is more accurate when done earlier in the pregnancy; if a later scan gives a different estimate of gestational age, the estimated age is not normally changed but rather it is assumed the fetus is not growing at the expected rate.

The abdominal circumference of the fetus may also be measured. This gives an estimate of the weight and size of the fetus and is important when doing serial ultrasounds to monitor fetal growth.

===Fetal sex discernment===
The sex of the fetus may be discerned by ultrasound as early as 11 weeks&#x27; gestation. The accuracy is relatively imprecise when attempted early. After 13 weeks&#x27; gestation, a high accuracy of between 99% and 100% is possible if the fetus does not display intersex external characteristics.

The following is accuracy data from two hospitals:
====Influencing factors====
The accuracy of fetal sex discernment depends on:
* Gestational age
* Precision of sonographic machine
* Expertise of the operator
* Fetal posture

===Ultrasonography of the cervix===
Obstetric sonography is useful in the assessment of the cervix in women at risk for premature birth. A short cervix preterm is associated with a higher risk for premature delivery: At 24 weeks&#x27; gestation, a cervix length of less than 25Â mm defines a risk group for spontaneous preterm birth. Further, the shorter the cervix, the greater the risk. Cervical measurement on ultrasound also has been helpful to use ultrasonography in patients with preterm contractions, as those whose cervical length exceeds 30Â mm are unlikely to deliver within the next week.

===Abnormality screening===

In most countries, routine pregnancy sonographic scans are performed to detect developmental defects before birth. This includes checking the status of the limbs and vital organs, as well as (sometimes) specific tests for abnormalities. Some abnormalities detected by ultrasound can be addressed by medical treatment in utero or by perinatal care, though indications of other abnormalities can lead to a decision regarding abortion.

Perhaps the most common such test uses a measurement of the nuchal translucency thickness (&quot;NT-test&quot;, or &quot;Nuchal Scan&quot;). Although 91% of fetuses affected by Down syndrome exhibit this defect, 5% of fetuses flagged by the test do not have Down syndrome.

Ultrasound may also detect fetal organ anomaly. Usually scans for this type of detection are done around 18 to 23 weeks of gestational age (called the &quot;anatomy scan&quot;, &quot;anomaly scan,&quot; or &quot;level 2 ultrasound&quot;). Some resources indicate that there are clear reasons for this and that such scans are also clearly beneficial because ultrasound enables clear clinical advantages for assessing the developing fetus in terms of morphology, bone shape, skeletal features, fetal heart function, volume evaluation, fetal lung maturity, and general fetus well being.

Second-trimester ultrasound screening for aneuploidies is based on looking for soft markers and some predefined structural abnormalities. Soft markers are variations from normal anatomy, which are more common in aneuploid fetuses compared to euploid ones. These markers are often not clinically significant and do not cause adverse pregnancy outcomes.

==Safety issues==

Current evidence indicates that diagnostic ultrasound is safe for the unborn child, unlike radiographs, which employ ionizing radiation. Randomized controlled trials have followed children up to ages 8â9, with no significant differences in vision, hearing, school performance, dyslexia, or speech and neurologic development by exposure to ultrasound. In one randomized trial, the children with greater exposure to ultrasound had a reduction in perinatal mortality, and was attributed to the increased detection of anomalies in the ultrasound group.

The 1985 maximum power allowed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of 180 milliwatts per square cm is well under the levels used in therapeutic ultrasound, but still higher than the 30â80 milliwatts per square cm range of the Statison V veterinary LIPUS device.

Doppler ultrasonography examinations has a thermal index (TI) of about five times that of regular (B-mode) ultrasound examinations. Several randomized controlled trials have reported no association between Doppler exposure and birth weight, Apgar scores, and perinatal mortality. One randomized controlled trial, however, came to the result of a higher perinatal death rate of normally formed infants born after 24 weeks exposed to Doppler ultrasonography (RR 3.95, 95% CI 1.32â11.77), but this was not a primary outcome of the study, and has been speculated to be due to chance rather than a harmful effect of Doppler itself.

The FDA discourages its use for non-medical purposes such as fetal keepsake videos and photos, even though it is the same technology used in hospitals.

The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine recommends spectral Doppler only if M-mode sonography is unsuccessful, and even then only briefly, due to the acoustic intensity delivered to the fetus.

==History==

Scottish physician Ian Donald was one of the pioneers of medical use of ultrasound. His article &quot;Investigation of Abdominal Masses by Pulsed Ultrasound&quot; was published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1958. Donald was Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Glasgow.

In 1962, David Robinson, George Kossoff, George Radovanovich, and Dr William Garrett were the first in the world to identify a number of foetal anatomical structures from high frequency sound wave imaging.

In 1962, after about two years of work, Joseph Holmes, William Wright, and Ralph Meyerdirk developed the first compound contact B-mode scanner. Their work had been supported by U.S. Public Health Services and the University of Colorado. Wright and Meyerdirk left the university to form Physionic Engineering Inc., which launched the first commercial hand-held articulated arm compound contact B-mode scanner in 1963. This was the start of the most popular design in the history of ultrasound scanners.

Obstetric ultrasound has played a significant role in the development of diagnostic ultrasound technology in general. Much of the technological advances in diagnostic ultrasound technology are due to the drive to create better obstetric ultrasound equipment. Acuson Corporation&#x27;s pioneering work on the development of Coherent Image Formation helped shape the development of diagnostic ultrasound equipment as a whole.

In March and April 2015, a post by a pregnant woman named Jen Martin (nÃ©e Cardinal) and her husband to YouTube, which had been viewed at least 2 million times and had many likes, showed the 14-week-old fetus clapping repeatedly to the song, sung by the parents, &quot;If You&#x27;re Happy And You Know It&quot;. It was later revealed that the videoÂ â while not a fakeÂ â had been somewhat edited to show more fetal claps than likely occurred. It is not unprecedented for fetuses of that age to make momentary movements that could be repeated once or twice beyond the initial movement, according to experts, but to repeat such a movement more than thatÂ â especially purposefullyÂ â would not likely be feasible at that point.

==Society and culture==

The increasingly widespread use of ultrasound technology in monitoring pregnancy has had a great impact on the way in which women and societies at large conceptualise and experience pregnancy and childbirth. The pervasive spread of obstetric ultrasound technology around the world and the conflation of its use with creating a &#x27;safe&#x27; pregnancy as well as the ability to see and determine features like the sex of the fetus affect the way in which pregnancy is experienced and conceptualised. This &quot;technocratic takeover&quot; of pregnancy is not limited to western or developed nations but also affects conceptualisations and experiences in developing nations and is an example of the increasing medicalisation of pregnancy, a phenomenon that has social as well as technological ramifications. Ethnographic research concerned with the use of ultrasound technology in monitoring pregnancy can show us how it has changed the embodied experience of expecting mothers around the globe.

Recent studies have stressed the importance of framing &quot;reproductive health matters cross-culturally&quot;, particularly when understanding the &quot;new phenomenon&quot; of &quot;the proliferation of ultrasound imaging&quot; in developing countries. In 2004, Tine Gammeltoft interviewed 400 women in Hanoi&#x27;s Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital; each &quot;had an average of 6.6 scans during her pregnancy&quot;, much higher than five years prior when &quot;a pregnant woman might or might not have had a single scan during her pregnancy&quot; in Vietnam. Gammeltoft explains that &quot;many Asian countries&quot; see &quot;the foetus as an ambiguous being&quot; unlike in Western medicine where it is common to think of the foetus as &quot;materially stable&quot;. Therefore, although women, particularly in Asian countries, &quot;express intense uncertainties regarding the safety and credibility of this technology&quot;, it is overused for its &quot;immediate reassurance&quot;.

<text>The Portugal national football team () has represented Portugal in men&#x27;s international football competitions since 1921. The national team is controlled by the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF), the governing body for football in Portugal. Portugal&#x27;s home games are played at the EstÃ¡dio Nacional stadiums in Portugal, and its primary training ground and technical headquarters, Cidade do Futebol, is located in Oeiras. The head coach of the team is Roberto MartÃ­nez, and the captain is Cristiano Ronaldo, who also holds the team records for most caps and most goals.

Portugal&#x27;s first participation in a major tournament finals was at the 1966 World Cup, which saw a team featuring Ballon d&#x27;Or winner EusÃ©bio finish in third place. Portugal also made it to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 1984, losing to hosts and eventual winners France. Under the team&#x27;s first golden generation in the 1990s, Portugal began consistently featuring in the European Championship and World Cup; they made the semi-finals of the 2006 World Cup, finishing in fourth place, along with placing as runners-up at Euro 2004 as hosts, and reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2000 and Euro 2012. This was in great part due to the production of several world class players, such as fellow Ballon d&#x27;Or winners LuÃ­s Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo.

In 2016, Portugal won its first-ever major trophy, Euro 2016, defeating hosts France in the finals. With the win, Portugal qualified and made its only appearance in the FIFA Confederations Cup held in Russia, where they finished in third place. Portugal qualified for and hosted the brand new 2019 Nations League finals where they triumphed, defeating the Netherlands and earning their second major tournament victory in three finals. Portugal also appeared in the Olympic football tournament, and made it to the semi-finals at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, finishing in fourth place.

Portugal is colloquially referred to as the &quot;SeleÃ§Ã£o das Quinas&quot; (a synecdoche based on the flag of the country) and has notable rivalries with Brazil, due to shared cultural traits and heritage, France, due to several important meetings between the two teams at the Euros and World Cup, and Spain, known as &quot;A Guerra IbÃ©rica&quot; in Portuguese or &quot;The Iberian War&quot; in English, with the rivalry between two countries going back to 1581.

==History==
===Early World Cup attempts===
Portugal were not invited to the 1930 World Cup, which only featured a finals stage and no qualification round. The team took part in the 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification, but failed to eliminate their Spanish opponents, aggregating two defeats in the two-legged round, with a 9â0 loss in Madrid and 2â1 loss in Lisbon for an aggregate score of 11â1.

In the 1938 FIFA World Cup qualification, the &quot;SeleÃ§Ã£o&quot; played one game against Switzerland held in neutral ground in Milan. They lost 2â1 and failed to qualify for the finals. The Second World War delayed the World Cup until 1950 and subsequently, the national team rarely played. A 10â0 home friendly loss against England, two years after the war, still stands as their biggest ever defeat.

===1950s and early 1960s===
Similar to 1934, Portugal were to play a two-legged round against Spain. After a 5â1 defeat in Madrid, they managed to draw the second game 2â2. With a 7â3 aggregate score, they did not qualify on the pitch, however they would later be invited to replace Turkey, which had withdrawn from participating. Portugal refused to participate.

In 1954 FIFA World Cup qualification, the team would play Austria; the Austrians won the first game with a 9â1 result. The best the Portuguese could do was hold the Austrians to a goalless draw in Lisbon, resulting in a 9â1 aggregate defeat. Four years later, Portugal won a qualifying match for the first time, a 3â0 home victory over Italy. Nevertheless, they finished last in a group that also featured Northern Ireland; only the first-placed team, Northern Ireland, would qualify.

1960 was the year that UEFA created the European Championship. The first edition was a knock-out tournament with the last four teams participating in the finals stage that only featured one leg while the earlier stages had two legs. In the first round, the &quot;SeleÃ§Ã£o das Quinas&quot; won 2â0 at East Germany and then 3â2 in Porto, advancing with a 5â2 two-legged win. Portugal faced Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals, losing 6â3 on aggregate.

Portugal faced England and Luxembourg in 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification and ended up second in the group, behind England, who would be the only team in Group 6 to qualify. In the 1964 European Championship, Portugal played against Bulgaria in the qualifying rounds. The Portuguese lost in Sofia and won in Lisbon. With the round tied 4â4, a replay was needed in a neutral country. In the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Portugal lost 1â0 thanks to a late strike from Georgi Asparuhov.

===Third place at the 1966 World Cup===
Portugal were drawn with Czechoslovakia, Romania and Turkey for 1966 World Cup qualification. They topped the group with only one draw and one defeat in six games and finally qualified for a FIFA World Cup, with a 1â0 away win against Czechoslovakia and Turkey and a 5â1 home win against the Turks being notable results.

At the World Cup, the team started out with three wins in the group stage after they beat Hungary 3â1, Bulgaria 3â0, and two-time defending champions Brazil 3â1. Secondly, they beat quarter-finalists North Korea 5â3, with EusÃ©bio getting four markers to overturn a 3â0 deficit. Later, they reached the semi-finals where they were beaten by hosts England 2â1; in this game, Portugal would have played in Liverpool, but as England were the hosts, FIFA decided that the game would be played in London. Portugal then defeated the Soviet Union 2â1 in the third place match for their best World Cup finish to date. EusÃ©bio was the top scorer of the World Cup with nine goals. Portugal would not qualify for another World Cup for 20 years.

===1980s===
Portugal won their Euro 1984 qualifying group that contained Finland, Poland and the Soviet Union with a win over the latter, allowing them to qualify and be placed in Group B alongside Spain, West Germany and Romania in the finals. In the first two matches, they drew 0â0 and 1â1 against West Germany and Spain, respectively. A 1â0 win over Romania resulted in a second-place finish in group play. Portugal were paired against hosts France in the semi-finals. After a draw in regular time, Portugal initially led 2â1 in extra-time, but the hosts scored in the 114th and 119th minutes to eliminate the Portuguese 3â2 and go through to the final.

For 1986 World Cup qualification, the &quot;SeleÃ§Ã£o&quot; played against Czechoslovakia, Malta, Sweden and West Germany for the two spots that would guarantee them a ticket to Mexico. Needing a win in the last game against West Germany in Stuttgart, Portugal won the game to become the first team to beat West Germany at their home ground in an official match. The team exited early in the group stages after a win and two losses. They started with a 1â0 win against England, but later were beaten by Poland and Morocco 1â0 and 3â1 respectively. Their staying in Mexico was marked by the Saltillo Affair, where players refused to train in order to win more prizes from the Portuguese Football Federation. Mexico marked their last World Cup appearance until 2002.

===1995â2006: The golden generation===
At UEFA Euro 1996, Portugal finished first in Group D, and in the quarter-finals, they lost 1â0 to the Czech Republic.

Portugal failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In Euro 2000 qualifying, Portugal finished second in their group, one point short of first-placed Romania. However, after finishing as the top runner-up nation in qualifying, Portugal nonetheless secured a spot in the finals. They then defeated England 3â2, Romania 1â0 and Germany 3â0 to finish first in Group A, then defeated Turkey in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals against France, Portugal were eliminated in extra time when Zinedine Zidane converted a penalty. Referee GÃ¼nter BenkÃ¶ awarded the spot kick for a handball after Abel Xavier blocked a shot. Xavier, Nuno Gomes and Paulo Bento were all given lengthy suspensions for subsequently shoving the referee. The final eventually finished 2â1.

During 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Portugal won the group. Several problems and poor judgement decisions occurred during the preparation and tournament itselfÂ â shopping sprees by players were widely reported in the Portuguese press. Questionable managing choices and some amateurism, including the same lack of agreement on prizes. Portugal entered the tournament as favourites to win Group D. However, they were upset 3â2 by the United States. They then rebounded with a 4â0 smashing of Poland. Needing a draw to advance, they lost the last group game to hosts South Korea. Portugal underachieved and ended third in its group stage, subsequently eliminated. Manager AntÃ³nio Oliveira was fired after the World Cup.

The next major competition, the UEFA Euro 2004, was held in Portugal. For preparation, the Football Federation made a contract with Luiz Felipe Scolari to manage the team until the tournament ended. The host nation lost the first game against Greece 1â2. They achieved their first win against Russia 2â0 and also beat Spain 1â0. They went on to play against England, in a 2â2 draw that went into penalties, with Portugal winning. Portugal beat the Netherlands 2â1 in the semi-finals, and suffered a second defeat from Greece, 1â0, in the final.

After the tournament ended, many players belonging to the &quot;GeraÃ§Ã£o de Ouro&quot; (Golden Generation), abandoned their international footballing careers, with only LuÃ­s Figo remaining in the team, despite a temporary retirement. The silver lining for Portugal was the emergence of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was selected in the UEFA Euro All-Star team. While Portugal were playing in the competition, Scolari agreed in a new two-year deal with the Federation.

Portugal finished first in the qualifying round for the 2006 World Cup, and topped Group D in the World Cup, with victories over Angola (1â0), Iran (2â0) and Mexico (2â1).
Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1â0 in the Round of 16 in Nuremberg in an acrimonious match marked by 16 yellow cards, with four players sent off. Portugal drew 0â0 after extra-time with England, but won 3â1 on penalties to reach their first World Cup semi-final since 1966. They then lost 1â0 against France, and faced hosts Germany in the third place play-off match in a 3â1 defeat.

===2006â2014: Post-golden generation and mixed results===
For Euro 2008 Portugal finished second in qualification behind Poland, and won their first two group games against Turkey and the Czech Republic, although a loss to co-hosts Switzerland set up a quarter-final matchup with Germany which the team lost 3â2. After the tournament, Scolari left to take over at Chelsea. Afterwards, Carlos Queiroz was appointed as the head coach of the Portugal national team.

Portugal came second in the qualifying stages for the 2010 FIFA World Cup under Queiroz, then beat Bosnia and Herzegovina in a play-off, thereby reaching every tournament in the decade. A 19-match undefeated streak, in which the team conceded only three goals, ended with a loss to eventual champions Spain in the round of 16, 1â0. Queiroz was later criticised for setting up his team in an overly cautious way. After the World Cup, squad regulars SimÃ£o, Paulo Ferreira, Miguel and Tiago all retired from international football. Queiroz was banned from coaching the national team for one month after he tried to block a doping test to the team while preparing for the World Cup, as well as directing insulting words to the testers. In consequence, he received a further six-month suspension. Several media outbursts from Queiroz against the heads of the Portuguese Football Federation followed, which partly prompted his dismissal. Paulo Bento was appointed as his replacement at head coach.

Bento&#x27;s team qualified for Euro 2012; they were drawn with Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands in a widely speculated &quot;group of death&quot;. They lost their first game 0â1 to Germany, then beat Denmark 3â2. The final group stage match was against the Netherlands. After Van der Vaart had given the Dutch a 1â0 lead, Ronaldo netted twice to ensure a 2â1 victory. Portugal finished second in the group and qualified for the knockout phase. Portugal defeated the Czech Republic 1â0 in the quarter-finals with a header from Ronaldo. The semi-final match was against Spain, who defeated Portugal 4â2 on penalties after a goalless draw.

In 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying, Portugal won 4â2 on aggregate in a play-off against Sweden with all four goals being scored by Ronaldo, and were drawn into Group G with the United States, Germany and Ghana. Their first match against the Germans was their worst-ever defeat in a World Cup, a 4â0 loss. They went on to draw 2â2 against the United States and won 2â1 against Ghana. However, the team were eliminated due to inferior goal difference to the Americans.
===2016âpresent: Euro 2016 and first international glories===
In UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, Bento was dismissed following a defeat to Albania and was replaced by Fernando Santos in September 2014. After qualifying for the finals, Portugal finished third in Group F but advanced to the knockout stages as the third-best third place team following three straight draws. Portugal beat Croatia 1â0 after extra time in the round of 16 and then defeated Poland 5â3 on penalties to reach the semi-finals, where they defeated Wales 2â0. In the final against the hosts France, Ronaldo went off injured. However, in extra time, substitute Eder scored the winning goal in the 109th minute. 

Following their Euro 2016 victory, Portugal participated in the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. They finished top of their group, but lost to Chile on penalties after a goalless draw in the semi-finals, but rebounded in the third place game, defeating Mexico 2â1 after extra time.

At the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Portugal opened their campaign with a 3â3 draw with Spain, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick. After a 1â0 victory against Morocco, Portugal drew 1â1 with Iran to progress to the knockout round as group runners-up. Portugal were eliminated following a 2â1 defeat to Uruguay in the round of 16.

Following the World Cup, Portugal won the inaugural UEFA Nations League beating the Netherlands at the EstÃ¡dio do DragÃ£o in Porto, with the only being scored by GonÃ§alo Guedes in the 60th minute.

At UEFA Euro 2020, Portugal were drawn into a group containing France, Germany and Hungary which was widely speculated as being the &quot;group of death&quot;. Portugal advanced to the next round by defeating Hungary, drawing with France and losing to Germany. There, they faced Belgium but lost 1â0. 

For the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Portugal were required to qualify for the finals via the play-offs after finishing second in their group. Nevertheless, Portugal managed to beat Turkey and North Macedonia to qualify for the final tournament. At the 2022 World Cup, Portugal defeated Ghana 3â2 in their first group game and then beat Uruguay 2â0. to qualify for the knockout stages. The Portuguese would demolish Switzerland 6â1 in the next round, their highest tally in a World Cup knockout game since the 1966 World Cup, with GonÃ§alo Ramos scoring a hat-trick. However, they were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Morocco, 1â0. Following a disappointing World Cup campaign, Santos was dismissed on 15 December. On 9 January 2023, Roberto Martinez was announced as the head coach of Portugal, replacing Fernando Santos.

===Kits===

Portugal&#x27;s traditional home kit is mainly red with a green trim, reflecting the colors of the nation&#x27;s flag. Over the years, the particular shade of red has alternated between a darker burgundy and a lighter scarlet. Both green and red shorts have been used to complete the strip.

The team&#x27;s away kits, on the other hand, have varied more considerably. White has typically been preferred as a dominant color, either with blue shorts, or red and green highlights. In recent times, all-black has been utilised, as has a turquoise-teal color, the latter of which was prominently featured during the title-winning Euro 2016 campaign.

<text>The year 1993 in [[science]] and technology involved many significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* February 13 â Asteroid 7253 Nara is discovered by Fumiaki Uto.
* December 2 â STS-61 is launched. This Space Shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) installs corrective optics, plus upgrades, that not only allow the telescope to focus properly, but also increase magnification/clarity beyond the original design. HST had been pre-designed for such continuous improvement.
* The first definite asteroid moon is confirmed when the Galileo probe discovers Dactyl orbiting 243 Ida.

==Computer science==
* March 22 â The Intel Corporation ships the first Pentium chips
* March 31 â A bug in a program written by Richard Depew sends an article to 200 newsgroups simultaneously. The term spamming is coined by Joel Furr to describe the incident.
* April â Release of the Sibelius music notation program, developed by British twins Ben and Jonathan Finn.
* April 22 â Release of version 1.0 of the Mosaic Web browser, devised by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina in the United States.
* June 9 â Release of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; making pioneering use of computer-generated imagery to produce moving images of prehistoric creatures.
* June 15 â Adobe publishes the first version of the PDF format together with version 1.0 of its PDF product line Adobe Acrobat

==Mathematics==
* April â Publication of a seminal paper on the particle filter.
* June 21 â Andrew Wiles announces a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem at the Isaac Newton Institute. The proof is slightly flawed, but Wiles announces a revised proof the following year.

==Paleontology==
* 14-year-old fossil hunter Wes Linster finds the first &quot;Bambiraptor&quot; skeleton in Montana.
* Giant sauropod dinosaur &quot;Argentinosaurus&quot; formally described by JosÃ© Bonaparte and Rodolfo Coria.

==Physics==
* Leon M. Lederman and Dick Teresi publish &quot;The God Particle&quot;.

==Physiology and medicine==
* February â The &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; publishes findings demonstrating that patients with peptic ulcers can be successfully treated with antibiotics, lending strong support to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease is caused by &quot;H. pylori&quot;.
* March 23 â Start of Milwaukee Cryptosporidiosis outbreak.
* July 15 â A study published by Dean Hamer and others in the United States indicates a link between the chromosome band and genetic marker Xq28 and male sexual orientation.
* August
** Formal launch of the Cochrane Collaboration.
** Francisco Mojica first characterizes what becomes known as the CRISPR locus.
* The &quot;Intelligent Prosthesis&quot;, the first commercially available microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knee, is released by UK company Charles A. Blatchford &amp; Sons.

==Awards==
* Nobel Prizes
** Physics â Russell A. Hulse, Joseph H. Taylor Jr.
** Chemistry â Kary Mullis, Michael Smith
** Medicine â Richard J. Roberts, Phillip A. Sharp
* Turing Award â Juris Hartmanis, Richard E. Stearns
* Wollaston Medal for Geology â Samuel Epstein

==Deaths==
* January 9 â Dame Janet Vaughan, English physiologist (b. 1899)
* February 11 â Robert W. Holley, American biochemist, winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (b. 1922)
* February 21 â Inge Lehmann, Danish seismologist (b. 1888)
* March 4 â Izaak Kolthoff, Dutch &#x27;father of analytical chemistry&#x27; (b. 1894)
* April 1 â Solly Zuckerman, British government scientific advisor (b. 1904)
* July 2 
** Elizabeth M. Ramsey, American research physician (b. 1906)
**Clarence Zener, American physicist (b. 1905)
* July 24 â Anna Maurizio, Swiss biologist (b. 1900)
* August 16 â Kitty Joyner, American electrical engineer (b. 1916)
* August 25 â Mildred Creak, English child psychologist (b. 1898)
* September 24 â Bruno Pontecorvo, Italian-born Soviet nuclear physicist (b. 1913)
* October 1 â Vera Peters, Canadian oncologist (b. 1911)

<doc id="576331" wikidata="Q1230207" url="?curid=576331" title="Quadrigatus">
<text>The quadrigatus was a medium-sized silver coin produced by the Roman Republic during the 3rd century BC. The obverse featured a young bust and the reverse featured Victory driving a quadriga (four-horse chariot), giving the coin its Roman name, with the inscription &quot;ROMA&quot; below.

The coin weighed about 6.8 grams (6 scruples), consistent with the weight of a south Italian Greek didrachm. It was minted for a number of years until shortly before the introduction of the denarius (a few years before 211 BC). Gold coins with similar obverse types were also issued at about the time that the quadrigatus was discontinued (staters and half-staters) which featured the same obverse type as the quadrigatus and the reverse type of two soldiers performing an oath over a third soldier holding a pig, with the inscription &quot;ROMA&quot; below. The choice of Janus for these coins is believed to coincide with the closing of the doors of the Temple of Janus, indicating the absence of warfare, a rare occasion. Michael Crawford, however, has suggested that the janiform head is more likely to have represented the Dioscuri, since Janus is usually a mature and bearded figure.

Roman-era historians such as Livy and Plutarch often refer to these early coins as denarii, but modern numismatic references consider them as anonymous Roman silver, produced before the standardization of the denarius just before 211 B.C. The name quadrigatus comes from the quadriga or four-horse chariot on the reverse, first seen on coins produced for Greek mints, which was the prototype for the most common designs used on Roman silver coins for the next 150 years.

The victoriatus was a later silver coin that was valued at half a quadrigatus (3 scruples). Its name was given to it because the reverse showed Victory personified, placing a wreath upon a trophy.

<doc id="576334" wikidata="Q239762" url="?curid=576334" title="Tropism">
<text>In biology, a tropism is a phenomenon indicating the growth or turning movement of an organism, usually a plant, in response to an environmental stimulus. In tropisms, this response is dependent on the direction of the stimulus (as opposed to nastic movements, which are non-directional responses). Tropisms are usually named for the stimulus involved; for example, a phototropism is a movement to the light source, and an anemotropism is the response and adaptation of plants to the wind.

Tropisms occur in three sequential steps. First, there is a sensation to a stimulus. Next, signal transduction occurs. And finally, the directional growth response occurs.

Tropisms can be regarded by ethologists as &quot;taxis&quot; (directional response) or &quot;kinesis&quot; (non-directional response).

The CholodnyâWent model, proposed in 1927, is an early model describing tropism in emerging shoots of monocotyledons, including the tendencies for the stalk to grow towards light (phototropism) and the roots to grow downward (gravitropism).
In both cases, the directional growth is considered to be due to asymmetrical distribution of auxin, a plant growth hormone.

The term &quot;tropism&quot; () is also used in unrelated contexts. Viruses and other pathogens affect what is called &quot;host tropism&quot;, &quot;tissue tropism&quot;, or &quot;cell tropism&quot;; in which case tropism refers to the way in which different viruses/pathogens have evolved to preferentially target specific host species, specific tissue, or specific cell types within those species. In English, the word &quot;tropism&quot; is also used to indicate an action done without cognitive thought: However, &quot;tropism&quot; in this sense has a proper, although non-scientific, meaning as an innate tendency, natural inclination, or propensity to act in a certain manner towards a certain stimulus.

== Types ==
Tropisms can be distinguished according to the orientation with respect to the direction of the stimulus. They can commonly be either &quot;positive&quot; (towards the stimulus) or &quot;negative&quot; (away from it). Both of these are &quot;orthotropic&quot;, and can be contrasted with tropisms that are &quot;diatropic&quot; (perpendicular to the stimulus) or &quot;plagiotropic&quot; (at an oblique angle).

According to the type of stimulus, tropisms can be:

* Aerotropism: the growth of plants towards or away from a source of wind
* Chemotropism: the movement or growth in response to chemicals
* Electrotropism, or galvanotropism: the movement or growth in response to an electric field
* Exotropism: continuation of growth &quot;outward,&quot; i.e. in the previously established direction
* Gravitropism (sometimes referred to as geotropism): is movement or growth in response to gravity
** Apogeotropism: negative geotropism
* Heliotropism: the diurnal motion or seasonal motion of plant parts in response to the direction of the Sun, (e.g. the sunflower)
** Apheliotropism: negative heliotropism
* Hydrotropism: movement or growth in response to water; in plants, the root cap senses differences in water moisture in the soil, and signals cellular changes that cause the root to curve towards the area of higher moisture
** Prohydrotropism: positive hydrotropism
* Hygrotropism: movement or growth in response to moisture or humidity
* Inotropism: muscular contraction in response to drugs
* Magnetotropism: movement or growth in response to magnetic fields
* Phototropism: movement or growth in response to lights or colors of light
** Aphototropism: negative phototropism
** Skototropism: negative phototropism of vines
* Selenotropism: motion of plant parts in response to the direction of the Moon
* Thermotropism: movement or growth in response to temperature
* Thigmotropism: movement or growth in response to touch or contact
* Traumatotropism: orientation deviation after suffering a wounding

<doc id="576337" wikidata="Q7186939" url="?curid=576337" title="Phoenix Nights">
<text>Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights, sometimes shortened to &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, is a British sitcom about The Phoenix Club, a working men&#x27;s club in the northern English town of Bolton, Greater Manchester. The show is a spin-off from the &quot;In the Club&quot; episode of the spoof documentary series &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot;, and in turn was followed by the spin-off &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;. It was produced by Goodnight Vienna Productions and Ovation Entertainments, and broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK.

The show was written by Peter Kay, Neil Fitzmaurice and Dave Spikey. All three writers star in the show, with Kay also directing in the second series. All the music was written by Toni Baker and Peter Kay. Additional material was provided by Paddy McGuinness.

Two series have been produced, which were first broadcast in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The first series transmission dates were brought ahead to January 2001 due to the success of Kay&#x27;s first home video stand-up release &quot;Live at the Top of the Tower&quot;, released in November 2000, and &quot;That Peter Kay Thing&quot; winning Best New TV Comedy at the British Comedy Awards, which meant the series began broadcasting before editing had even been completed on all episodes.

&quot;Peter Kay&#x27;s Phoenix Nights&quot; won the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the British Comedy Awards 2002, and was nominated for several others.

==Characters==

The owner of The Phoenix Club is wheelchair user Brian Potter (played by Peter Kay), who has presided over two clubs in the past: the first (The Aquarius) flooded, the second (The Neptune) burned down. His ambition, with the help of Jerry St Clair, is to see The Phoenix Club become the most popular in Bolton and thus outdo his nemesis, Den Perry (Ted Robbins), owner of rival club The Banana Grove.

==The Phoenix Club==
The Phoenix Club is a fictional working men&#x27;s club in Farnworth near Bolton. The Phoenix Club is home to entertainment of all types, including bingo, singing, cabaret and a wide range of themed nights. The club was opened by Brian Potter and is run by him and his staff.

=== Employees ===
The club has a number of workers:
* Brian Potter: Owner of the club, who goes to any extremes to keep it open.
* Jerry St. Clair: Compere, Cabaret singer and fall guy of the show. He later becomes licensee of the club.
* The Captain: The club&#x27;s doorman. He dies in series 1, episode 2.
* Ray Von: A former fairground worker and electrician, who is the club&#x27;s DJ and sound engineer.
* Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Bygraves and Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; O&#x27;Shea: The club&#x27;s two bouncers.
* Les and Alan: The two backing players, with drums and keyboard, known as &quot;Les Alanos&quot;.
* Kenny Senior: A Jack of all trades at the club and compulsive liar. Claims to have stayed in a tent next to Robert De Niro in Pwllheli and beaten him at Swingball.
* Young Kenny: A young, dim-witted handyman.
* Mary (Holy Mary): Bar worker and strict Catholic.
* Spencer: Ignorant but hard-working barman.
* Ant and Dec: Two illegal Chinese immigrants whom the club accidentally brought into the country. Employed by Brian Potter as chefs.
* Marion: Bar worker, cleaner and chef. She is good friends with Mary and also works as Brian&#x27;s PA.
* Joyce: Bar worker who replaces Marion in series 2.
* Mary: Holy Mary&#x27;s daughter and member of the bar staff.
=== Layout ===
The club follows the layout of a typical working men&#x27;s club, with a large cabaret room along with a lounge area (called &#x27;The Pennine Suite&#x27; in the opening series). In an attempt to diversify and attract more customers, the lounge is later converted into a successful Chinese restaurant named &quot;The Golden Phoenix&quot;. There is also a games room in the club, which was named the &quot;Jocky Wilson Suite&quot; in the first series, and the &quot;Tony Knowles Suite&quot; in the second. In the first series, the room was shown as a home to the games supplied by &quot;Dodgy Eric&quot;, such as the wonky snooker table, the bucking bronco and the child&#x27;s aeroplane ride. In the second series, the games room is used more as lounge and general social area with dining tables, although there is a dartboard and a new snooker table. The solarium is also adjacent, through a door from this room. The Pennine Suite served as a general large lounge and social area in the first series, but was seldom seen in the second series; it contains a small stage used for Wednesday &quot;free and easy&quot; nights. Eventually it was replaced by a Chinese restaurant. The other room in the club is a larger cabaret style room, which plays host to larger features such as Talent Trek and Stars in their Eyes.

==Filming location==
As well as being set in Bolton, &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; is also filmed in the area. The location for the club itself is St Gregory&#x27;s Social Club on Church Street in Farnworth, a few miles from Bolton.

When Max and Paddy return from France in Series 2, the location used is Fleetwood Docks.

==Plot==
Throughout the two series of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, a theme of the show is the rivalry between The Phoenix Club and local rival club &#x27;The Banana Grove&#x27;, run by the flamboyant Den Perry. Brian Potter devises ideas for the club to attract more customers, usually to the disapproval of Jerry &quot;The Saint&quot; St. Clair. As more people come to the club, its popularity exceeds that of its rivals. Despite this, Brian Potter&#x27;s thrifty ways means he continues to try to cut corners in the running of the club.

The second series follows on from the first. Following the staging of the highly regarded local talent contest &#x27;Talent Trek&#x27; a vengeful Den Perry burns the club down. With the authorities taking a dim view of Potter&#x27;s poor attitude towards fire safety and suspending his licence, he then rebuilds the club on the cheap with Jerry as the licensee. The club bounces back and regains its popularity, with schemes such as placing a fake speed camera outside the club to slow motorists down, and a re-enactment of the club&#x27;s arson on TV show &quot;Crimetime&quot; (a parody of &quot;Crimewatch&quot;) in order to gain free advertising.

Following Potter&#x27;s hiring of two Chinese immigrants, Jerry decides to open a Chinese restaurant inside the club, which, despite Potter&#x27;s concerns, becomes an instant hit, driving the Phoenix to success whilst leaving other clubs behind. Infuriated at this, Den Perry decides to burn the club again but unwittingly reveals to the clientele that he burned down the Phoenix Club the first time and he is arrested for arson and the club is victorious.

==Episode guide==

===Series 1===
;Episode 1
It is the opening day of Brian Potter&#x27;s new club, the Phoenix (two of his previous clubs having burned down while another flooded). With &quot;TV&#x27;s own Roy Walker&quot; opening the club, Brian wants everything to be perfect. But he has to contend with a power cut that leaves the club in the dark, the theft of the bingo machine, a German-speaking &quot;Das Boot&quot; arcade machine, Max the doorman injuring himself and a racist folk band called &quot;Half A Shilling&quot; (with the lead singer played by Tim Healy). The band are ostensibly singing about Holy Communion Shoes, although journalist Deborah Quinn detects the racist metaphor in the song entitled &quot;Send The Buggers Back&quot;. These factors soon ruin everything. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is a pair of spacemen, one on a spinning disc, miming to a David Bowie song.

;Episode 2
The club&#x27;s doorman, the Captain, dies, possibly as a result of inhaling smoke from new DJ Ray Von&#x27;s home-made smoke machine. There is further misfortune when two men in overalls walk in off the street and steal the television set, with the staff doing nothing about it, except for Kenny Senior who kindly hands them the remote control. A warped snooker table is replaced by a bucking bronco, which leads to a Wild West Night being held. It&#x27;s a huge success, until Jerry&#x27;s blatantly biased shoot-out between teams from Lancashire and Yorkshire gets violent and a drunken horse tries to have sex with the bucking bronco. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is an escape artist, trapped in a bag.

;Episode 3
Jerry St. Clair has booked psychic medium Clinton Baptiste (Alex Lowe) for the club, following a recommendation by Den Perry. Jerry seems oblivious to the fact that Den Perry wants the Phoenix Club to fail. Brian and Jerry then have to attend a fire safety seminar at the Banana Grove Club presented by Keith Lard (from That Peter Kay Thing), who was arrested for &quot;interfering&quot; with dogs, but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. After the meeting, Lard tells Brian he will be inspecting the club immediately to ensure it meets safety standards. Jerry and Brian rush back to the club before Keith inspects it, but a run-in with the police delays them and Keith shuts the club down for being unsafe. Never a quitter, Brian blackmails Lard with a faked photo of Lard&#x27;s head on the body of a semi-nude man (with a dog) so that he re-opens the club. However, the event they re-open for, the psychic night, forces Brian to refund all his guests after Clinton Baptiste tells a bit more about the future than the guests would like. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is a bad juggler, breaking his props.

;Episode 4
It&#x27;s &#x27;Singles Night&#x27; at the Phoenix club and house band Les Alanos and bouncers Max and Paddy are all looking. Brian is the most successful, though, when he accidentally runs over a woman&#x27;s foot before buying her a drink and talking the night away. Throughout the episode, their relationship progresses, until Beverley (played by Jo Enright) reveals to Brian that she works for the DSS and was sent to investigate him for fraudulent disability claims. Despite Beverley&#x27;s assertions that her feelings for him are genuine, Brian ends the relationship. Elsewhere, Paddy strikes up a relationship with Holy Mary&#x27;s daughter Mary. The audition at the end of the episode is a man jumping around to &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot; wearing little more than a mackintosh and an elephant soft toy&#x27;s trunk over his genitals.

;Episode 5
Jerry is in hospital. Before Brian argues with Jerry&#x27;s decision to host an alternative comedy night, the comedy night turns out to be a disaster, with none of the entrants being any good. As one of the acts, Steve Davies plays a placid metalwork teacher introduced as &#x27;Darius&#x27; by Jerry. Darius comes on wearing only a pair of C&amp;A underpants with &#x27;Darius&#x27; written in ink on his body. He proceeds to have a psychotic episode, with unintelligible language delivered menacingly towards the audience and the house band onstage whilst striking the drummer&#x27;s cymbal with his hand. He is crying out to the universe to complete his breakdown. At the end of it all, Jerry has a heated confrontation with a student who had been heckling him, until the student threatens to hit Jerry and all the staff stick up for him. Elsewhere, Ray Von hosts a Robot Wars tournament, which is won by Max and Paddy, who are using a robot built by Ray, who has a penchant for electronics. At the end of the episode, a man called Dougie Hayes offers Jerry a job on a cruise ship. The auditioning act at the end of the episode are a pair of elderly Spanish dancers.

;Episode 6
Jerry gets an all-clear from hospital. However, Brian tells him to keep pretending to be ill because the club got the rights to host Talent Trek because he told the organisers that Jerry is dying. Tensions boil when Brian has to hire a Right Said Fred tribute band called &#x27;Right Said Frank&#x27; for the grand finale due to Les Alanos performing a Karate Kid musical with the local youth club on the same night. Right Said Frank end up stealing stereos from all the cars parked outside. Ray Von tries to stop them but he is overpowered. Luckily, they slam into Max&#x27;s car, setting off his personal alarm. Max and Paddy rush outside and tackle the two men to the ground. Brian then &#x27;reveals&#x27; to the audience that Jerry has got an all-clear for his illness. Despite everything, Jerry can&#x27;t bring himself to leave the club and turns down the cruise ship job offer. The series concludes with Den Perry, outraged at the success of the Phoenix Club, setting it on fire.

===Series 2===
;Episode 1
Brian and the staff watch the club burn to the ground, with Jerry managing to rescue Brian&#x27;s little disabled boy-shaped charity box. After the flames are put out, a firefighter reveals the fire was caused by a discarded cigarette or cigar, leading Brian to believe Den Perry was responsible. Brian then has to appear in court due to his negligence towards fire and safety equipment and forging of insurance documents. As a result, his alcohol licence is permanently revoked and he is blacklisted by the breweries. Despite all this, Brian dreams of rebuilding the Phoenix Club. On his trip to Asda he finds Jerry and Alan singing parodies of famous songs to promote products. Brian begs Jerry to help him to rebuild the Phoenix but Jerry rebuffs him and tells him to forget about the Phoenix and move on. Still undeterred, Brian travels to Blackpool to visit an old friend, Frank Cartwright (played by Jim Bowen), owner of the Hotel &quot;Le Ponderosa: Sunshine Indoors&quot;. Cartwright advises him to sell bottles and cans to get around the ban, get a licensee whom he can manipulate and have multiple facilities under one roof. Brian then phones around to find all the staff. He finds Les working as a butcher, Kenny Senior as a lollipop man (constantly lying to the kids crossing the road), Ray Von DJing at a fairground, and Holy Mary in church. In what was to become an iconic moment for the series he calls Max and Paddy as they are driving elderly Asian gentlemen to a mosque and singing at the tops of their voices to &quot;I Could Be so Good For You and Tony Christie&#x27;s classic hit &quot;Is This The Way To Amarillo?&quot;. Brian succeeds in bringing all of them together to discuss his plans, and convinces Jerry to become the new licensee. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is a magician whose pigeon gets caught in a rotating fan.

;Episode 2
Reconstruction is going quite well, and a fun day is organised to raise awareness of the rebuilding. However, an inflatable that resembles an erect penis is rejected by Brian, so it is fastened to the ground and covered up to look like a snake. Unfortunately, the inflatable escapes from its cover and explodes, shocking everyone who is spending their money. Furthermore, a botched face-painting job leaves Young Kenny with a permanent tiger face. Elsewhere, Max and Paddy go to France to stock up on booze, unwittingly picking up two Chinese immigrants in the process. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is a young woman who fires ping pong balls from her vagina.

;Episode 3
Brian decides to get the club on Crimetime for publicity and a chance to accuse Den Perry. Changes are made throughout the club to make it look good for the TV crew, but the TV appearance is a disaster when Brian loses it after he believes that he is being accused of burning the club down himself. Elsewhere, Spencer is hired for the vacant bar job. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is a one-legged Elvis impersonator.

;Episode 4
Brian comes across two Japanese people promoting their new lager, and offers them a chance to promote it in the club, an offer they accept. A pub quiz is arranged, with the winner taking home a year&#x27;s supply of the lager. Both Brian and Den Perry enter teams to try and win it. Brian&#x27;s team wins, but his victory is short-lived when it turns out the lager is non-alcoholic. In the other suite, Jerry&#x27;s medication binge gets the better of him and he loses it on stage, which causes him to go into the next suite and urinate everywhere, shocking the customers. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is a man with a battery-powered singing teddy bear.

;Episode 5
A power cut in Brian&#x27;s home sees him stuck on his stair lift all night until Jerry breaks his door down the next morning. At the club, Jerry has turned part of the club into a Chinese restaurant called &quot;The Golden Phoenix&quot;. A ladies night has been arranged, which causes Paddy to go on stage dressed in nothing but a fake moustache and leather thong, and carrying a trident. Outside, Max is accosted by a woman who wants her husband killed. Max tells her that he will kill her husband for Â£8,000. Lying to Paddy that she will pay them both Â£1,000, Max gets Paddy to agree to do the job with him. Max, Paddy and Max&#x27;s brother Terry go to practise shooting using a Broomhandled Mauser which Max&#x27;s grandad gave him. When Paddy starts to fire, he accidentally shoots Terry. Eventually, Max and Paddy can&#x27;t kill the man and give him Â£3,000 to leave the country. Max gives Paddy Â£1,000, and spends Â£4,000 on a motor home. The auditioning act at the end of the episode is the same man as in S2E4, this time with a battery-powered singing gorilla.

;Episode 6
Max and Paddy spot the man they were meant to kill in town, and are later confronted by his angry wife, who hints that she has put a hit out on them. She also reveals to Paddy that she paid Max Â£8,000, of which Paddy only received Â£1,000. In the club, Brian has arranged a Stars in Your Eyes night to impress a brewery representative who is coming over. Unfortunately, Den Perry has other ideas and cancels the acts by impersonating Jerry. However, in a memorable series of scenes, all of the staff from the club dress up to become acts, including Holy Mary as Lulu, Ray Von and Les Alanos as Adam and the Ants, Kenny Senior as Britney Spears, Young Kenny as Meat Loaf, Jerry as Eminem and George Michael, Brian as Elton John and Spencer as Gary Glitter. At the end of the episode, Den Perry threatens Brian and talks to him about burning the club down before and makes threats to do it again. However, he is unaware that Brian has switched on a radio microphone on his desk, meaning that the entire club has heard the conversation. Den Perry is arrested and the staff celebrate. Ray Von then reminds Brian that now the truth has come out, he can get his licence back. However, Brian decides to let Jerry remain as licensee and the staff hold a toast to Jerry. At the end of the episode, Max, terrified that there is a hit out on him, is about to flee all over the country in his motor home, when Paddy decides to come with him, setting the scene for the spin-off series &quot;Max and Paddy&#x27;s Road to Nowhere&quot;.

==Keith Laird controversy==

A complaint was filed about the show in 2001 by Keith Laird, a fire safety officer working for Bolton Council. He claimed that the character Keith Lard in series 1 episode 3 was based on him. Channel 4 issued an apology for any confusion and Kay maintained that Lard was fictional:
==Broadcasts==
* Series 1: six episodes, broadcast 14 January 2001 to 18 February 2001
* Series 2: six episodes, broadcast 8 August 2002 to 12 September 2002

&quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; is rarely repeated on British television. During an interview with Danny Baker for &quot;Peter Kay In Conversation&quot;, Kay stated he resents allowing his shows, including &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot;, to be repeated as it &quot;dilutes the quality&quot; of the programme, citing &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; as an example of a highly regarded programme &quot;ruined&quot; by excessive repeat showings.

==Potential third series==
In September 2006, Kay revealed on BBC Radio 1 that a third series of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; has been written, but it is unknown when the series will be filmed. On 8 May 2007, another announcement by Kay was made promising another series will be made. However Dave Spikey, in interviews with &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;Croydon Guardian&quot; in late 2009, claimed that neither he nor fellow co-writer Neil Fitzmaurice were aware of any plans to bring back the series. In a recent interview with Peter Kay he stated that he had written a third series of &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; and had even written a screenplay for it. However, when asked if he would be going back there he said that he would prefer to do something new next. Kay also claims he&#x27;s been approached to make a &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; movie following the success of &quot;The Inbetweeners Movie&quot;. In August 2014, it was reported that Kay was in talks to revive &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; in the form of a series of live shows for Comic Relief in 2015. In November 2014, Kay announced during a charity fundraising event at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, that an official announcement would be made regarding the revival of the show. Kay confirmed again in April 2017 that a third series had been written but that &quot;things kept getting in the way&quot; of filming it.

The film scenario written by John Wierick and Jacob Krueger, it starred Shane Meier as Matthew, Stockard Channing as Judy Shepard and Sam Waterston as Dennis Shepard.

Producers were Alliance Atlantis Communications, with the assistance/participation of CTV and Cosmic Entertainment, with support from the Cdn. Film or Video Production Tax Credit (CPTC). The film premiered on NBC on March 16, 2002, the same day HBO aired another Shepard film entitled &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;. &quot;The Matthew Shepard Story&quot; was also shown on CTV, with language versions shown in many countries.

==Plot==
In 1998, a young gay man by the name of Matthew Shepard (Shane Meier) was robbed, viciously beaten and left tied to a fence to die. Although he&#x27;s found by the police, rescued and hospitalized, he dies from his injuries. This film recounts the events after the conviction of the two men responsible for this hate-motivated murder.

Matthew&#x27;s parents, though satisfied by the conviction, are finding the sentencing phase of the trial more difficult. The parents initially want to request the death penalty for their son&#x27;s murderers, but the mother, Judy Shepard (Stockard Channing), starts to reconsider. As they struggle with their decision, they decide to reexamine the life of their son and rediscover his personality, his struggle to accept his homosexuality as a natural part of his being and above all, his generous humanity to others. All of this leads the parents to appeal to the court the way their son would have wanted, not out of vengeance but to represent best of what their son was and the tragedy of his loss.

<text>The , also known in abbreviated form as the or even conversationally as the Shin Kokin, is the eighth imperial anthology of waka poetry compiled by the Japanese court, beginning with the &quot;Kokin WakashÅ«&quot; circa 905 and ending with the &quot;Shinshokukokin WakashÅ«&quot; circa 1439. The name can be literally translated as &quot;New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems&quot; and bears an intentional resemblance to that of the first anthology. Together with the &quot;Man&#x27;yÅshÅ«&quot; and the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;, the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; is widely considered to be one of the three most influential poetic anthologies in Japanese literary history. It was commissioned in 1201 by the retired emperor Go-Toba (r. 1183â1198), who established a new Bureau of Poetry at his NijÅ palace with eleven Fellows, headed by Fujiwara no Yoshitsune, for the purpose of conducting poetry contests and compiling the anthology. Despite its emphasis on contemporary poets, the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; covered a broader range of poetic ages than the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;, including ancient poems that the editors of the first anthology had deliberately excluded. It was officially presented in 1205, on the 300th anniversary of the completion of the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;.

==Editors of the anthology==
Although Go-Toba retained veto power over the poems included in the anthology as well as the order in which they were presented, he assigned the task of compilation to six of the Fellows of the Bureau of Poetry. These were Fujiwara no Teika (1162â1241), Fujiwara no Ariie (1155â1216), Fujiwara no Ietaka (1158â1237), Jakuren (c. 1139â1202), Minamoto no Michitomo (1171â1237) and Asukai Masatsune (1170â1221). The anthology was also given a preface in Japanese prose by Fujiwara no Yoshitsune and a preface in Chineseâthe scholarly language of the Courtâby Fujiwara no Chikatsune, in a manner reminiscent of the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;.

==Significance==
The significance of the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; lies prominently in the technical expertise of the compilers, their novel and extensive use of the honkadori literary technique, and the effect that each of these elements had on Japanese poetry after its publication. Even though the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot; is famous in part for its organization throughout the anthology, as each poem is generally given as a lead-in to the next, the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; goes above and beyond the standard created by the original collection. The &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot; editors used linking poems as a general guide, but the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; editors created &quot;an anthology that may be read from beginning to end as a single long structure divided into books&quot;. For example, in the sections on the topic of Spring, the editors pieced together a detailed representation in poetic form of the advancement of spring and the passage of time, using similar words and expressions to link each poem to the next. In the section on travel poems, the progression is from ancient poets and styles to modern ones, and as is common in Japanese waka anthologies, the sections on Love are arranged to show the stages of an affair from first love to bitter parting.

This kind of detailed manipulation resulted in an anthology that did not necessarily contain all of the best works of the day. As Fujiwara no Teika complained, Go-Tobaâs insistence on including the works of old, obscure or even unaccomplished composers in the anthology in order to maintain appropriate links to those poems that were worthwhile made the honor of having forty-six of his own poems included in the anthology less satisfactory. Individual egos aside, the result was a composition that not only spanned centuries of Japanese literary tradition and evolving literary styles but also provided a veritable textbook on what well and poorly written poems looked like. The elaborate linking format developed by the editors was also picked up and carried forward with the development of the renga or &quot;linked verse&quot; form, in which poets wrote a series of verses together in turns by continuing the image of the previous verse and introducing something new for the next poet to work with. Renga also made frequent use of the honkadori technique, since each poet had only a short phrase to work with and the ability to use allusions to prior, complete poems was an important one.

The term &quot;Honkadori&quot; refers to the practice of &quot;allusive variation,&quot; and can be literally translated as &quot;taking from an original poem&quot;. Even though allusions to older poems were common in the poetic discourse of the day, following the 11th century and prior to Fujiwara no Teikaâs experimentation with honkadori, it was frowned upon to make obvious borrowings from past writers. However, that changed significantly with the publication of the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot;. Instead of mimicking only the horizontal flow of the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;, the poems in the New Collection also make vertical links to the poetic traditions of the past, and by borrowing from specific poems and not simply from stock phrases, the authors and editors of the poems in the&quot; Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; were able to step away from overused and more clearly unoriginal topics that ancient poems had popularized. The following example compares one of Teikaâs own poems in the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; to its honka, or original poem, in the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;.

Although the poems are written on the same subject, with the newer one drawing directly from the older, Fujiwara no Teikaâs interpretation both modernizes the poem and provides it with greater subtlety. It also accomplishes a connection between the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot; and the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot;.

==Structure==
 The structure of the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; echoes that of the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot; in many ways, but it also shows the influence of the intervening imperial anthologies. As can be seen in the table below, the &quot;Shin KokinshÅ«&quot; omits certain books from the original anthology, and includes others on poetic topics that gained prominence only after the publication of the &quot;KokinshÅ«&quot;.
The 20 books of the Shin KokinshÅ« contain nearly 2,000 waka, with the number varying depending on the edition, as Go-Toba continued to edit the anthology extensively even after his exile to the island of Oki. Each poem is introduced with information regarding the occasion for which it was composed (if that information was available) and in most cases an author is also listed. Major contemporary poetic contributors to the Shin KokinshÅ« include SaigyÅ with 94 poems; Jien with 92; Fujiwara no Yoshitsune with 79; Fujiwara no Shunzei with 72; Princess Shikishi with 49; Fujiwara no Teika with 46; Fujiwara no Ietaka with 43; Jakuren with 35; and Go-Toba with 33.

<doc id="576344" wikidata="Q7692656" url="?curid=576344" title="Technorealism">
<text>Technorealism is an attempt to expand the middle ground between techno-utopianism and Neo-Luddism by assessing the social and political implications of technologies so that people might all have more control over the shape of their future. An account cited that technorealism emerged in the early 1990s and was introduced by Douglas Rushkoff and Andrew Shapiro. In the &quot;Technorealism&quot; manifesto, which described the term as a new generation of cultural criticism, it was stated that the goal was not to promote or dismiss technology but to understand it so the application could be aligned with basic human values. Technorealism suggests that a technology, however revolutionary it may seem, remains a continuation of similar revolutions throughout human history.

== Approach ==
The technorealist approach involves a continuous critical examination of how technologies might help or hinder people in the struggle to improve the quality of their lives, their communities, and their economic, social, and political structures. In addition, instead of policy wonks, experts, and the elite, it is the technology critic who assumes the center stage in the discourse of technology policy issues.

Although technorealism began with a focus on U.S.-based concerns about information technology, it has evolved into an international intellectual movement with a variety of interests such as biotechnology and nanotechnology.

<text>Jean Rousseau (1 October 1644 â 1 June 1699) was a French viol player, theorist, composer, and author remembered principally for his &quot;TraitÃ© de la viole&quot; (1687), a valuable source of information on the performance practices of his time, as well as on techniques used in the construction of viols .

Rousseau was a pupil of Sainte Colombe for just one month, as the culmination of three years&#x27; study of the viol, and later dedicated his &quot;TraitÃ©&quot; to him. In that work, Rousseau defended Sainte Colombe&#x27;s innovations in left-hand technique, and systematically refuted the attacks made by Le Sieur de Machy in the preface to his &quot;PiÃ¨ces de violle&quot; (1685) .

<text>142,857 is the natural number following 142,856 and preceding 142,858. It is both a Kaprekar number and a Cyclic number.

==Cyclic number==

142857 is the best-known cyclic number in base 10, being the six repeating digits of (0.).

If 142857 is multiplied by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, the answer will be a cyclic permutation of itself, and will correspond to the repeating digits of , , , or respectively:

: 1 Ã 142,857 = 142,857
: 2 Ã 142,857 = 285,714
: 3 Ã 142,857 = 428,571
: 4 Ã 142,857 = 571,428
: 5 Ã 142,857 = 714,285
: 6 Ã 142,857 = 857,142
: 7 Ã 142,857 = 999,999

If multiplying by an integer greater than 7, there is a simple process to get to a cyclic permutation of 142857. By adding the rightmost six digits (ones through hundred thousands) to the remaining digits and repeating this process until only six digits are left, it will result in a cyclic permutation of 142857:

: 142857 Ã 8 = 1142856
: 1 + 142856 = 142857

: 142857 Ã 815 = 116428455
: 116 + 428455 = 428571

: 1428572 = 142857 Ã 142857 = 20408122449
: 20408 + 122449 = 142857

Multiplying by a multiple of 7 will result in 999999 through this process:

: 142857 Ã 74 = 342999657
: 342 + 999657 = 999999

If you square the last three digits and subtract the square of the first three digits, you also get back a cyclic permutation of the number.

: 8572 = 734449
: 1422 = 20164
: 734449 â 20164 = 714285

It is the repeating part in the decimal expansion of the rational number = 0.. Thus, multiples of are simply repeated copies of the corresponding multiples of 142857:

: formula_1

== Connection to the enneagram ==
The 142857 number sequence is used in the enneagram figure, a symbol of the Gurdjieff Work used to explain and visualize the dynamics of the interaction between the two great laws of the Universe (according to G. I. Gurdjieff), the Law of Three and the Law of Seven. The movement of the numbers of 142857 divided by , . etc., and the subsequent movement of the enneagram, are portrayed in Gurdjieff&#x27;s sacred dances known as the movements.

== Other properties ==
The 142857 number sequence is also found in several decimals in which the denominator has a factor of 7. In the examples below, the numerators are all 1, however there are instances where it does not have to be, such as (0.).

For example, consider the fractions and equivalent decimal values listed below:

: = 0...

: = 0.0...

: = 0.03...

: = 0.0...

: = 0.017...

: = 0.0...

The above decimals follow the 142857 rotational sequence. There are fractions in which the denominator has a factor of 7, such as and , that do not follow this sequence and have other values in their decimal digits.

<text>Jean Parker &quot;Shep&quot; Shepherd Jr. (July 26, 1921 â October 16, 1999) was an American storyteller, humorist, radio and TV personality, writer, and actor. With a career that spanned decades, Shepherd is known for the film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983), which he narrated and co-scripted on the basis of his own semi-autobiographical stories.

==Early life==
Shepherd was born in 1921, to Jean Parker Shepherd and Anna, on the South Side of Chicago. He briefly lived in East Chicago, Indiana, but was raised in Hammond, Indiana, where he graduated from Hammond High School, in 1939.

&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is loosely based on his days growing up in Hammond&#x27;s southeast neighborhood of Hessville. As a youth, he worked briefly as a mail carrier in a steel mill and earned his amateur radio license (W9QWN) at age 16, sometimes claiming he was even younger. He sporadically attended Indiana University, but never graduated. During World War II, he served stateside in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. Shepherd then had an extensive career in a variety of media.

==Career==
===Radio===
After his military service, Shepherd began his broadcast radio career in early 1945, on WJOB in Hammond, Indiana, later working at WTOD in Toledo, Ohio, in 1946. He began working in Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 1947 at WSAI, later also working at Cincinnati stations WCKY and WKRC the following year, before returning to WSAI in 1949. From 1951 to 1953, he had a late-night broadcast on KYW in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after which he returned to Cincinnati for several different shows on WLW. After a stint on television there, he returned to radio. &quot;Shep&quot;, as he was known, settled in at WOR radio New York City on February 26, 1955, where he would remain until spring 1977. Beginning on an overnight slot in 1956, he delighted his fans by telling stories, reading poetry (especially the works of Robert W. Service), and organizing comedic listener stunts.

==== &quot;I, Libertine&quot; hoax ====
The most famous stunt was a hoax he created about a nonexistent book, &quot;I, Libertine&quot;, by a fake author &quot;Frederick R. Ewing&quot;, in 1956. During a discussion on how easy it was to manipulate the best-seller lists based on demand, as well as sales, Shepherd suggested that his listeners visit bookstores and ask for a copy of &quot;I, Libertine&quot;, which led to booksellers attempting to order the book from their distributors. Fans of the show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Filling the demand, Theodore Sturgeon and Betty Ballantine wrote the long-awaited book to Shepherd&#x27;s outline, with a cover designed by illustrator Frank Kelly Freas, published by Ballantine Books.

==== Sweetheart Soap ====
When he was about to be released by WOR in 1956 for lack of sponsors, he did a commercial for Sweetheart Soap, not a sponsor, and was immediately fired. His listeners besieged WOR with complaints, and when Sweetheart offered to sponsor him, he was reinstated. Eventually, he attracted more sponsors than he wantedthe commercials interrupted the flow of his monologues. Former WOR engineer, Frank Cernese, adds, &quot;The commercials of that era were on &#x27;ETs&#x27;phonograph records about 14&quot; in diameter. Three large turntables were available to play them in sequence. Shepherd preferred the engineer to watch and listen to his stories. That left little time to load the turntables and cue the appropriate cuts. That was when he started complaining about &quot;too many commercials&quot;.

His last WOR broadcast was on April 1, 1977. His subsequent radio work consisted of short segments on several other stations, including crosstown WCBS, and occasional commentaries on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. His final radio gig was the Sunday-night radio show &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Pie&quot; on WBAI in the mid-1990s, which had him reading his stories uncut, uninterrupted, and unabridged. The show was one of WBAI&#x27;s most popular of the period.

In addition to his stories, his shows also contained humorous anecdotes and commentaries about the human condition, observations about New York City life, accounts of vacations in Maine, and travels throughout the world. One striking program recounted his participation in the March on Washington in August 1963, during which Martin Luther King Jr. gave his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, and another program that aired on November 25, 1963, covered the burial of assassinated President John F. Kennedy.

Throughout his radio career, he performed without scripts. His friend and WOR colleague Barry Farber marveled at how he could talk so long with so few notes. During a radio interview, Shepherd claimed that some shows took weeks to prepare, but this may have been in the planning rather than the writing of a script. On most of his Fourth of July broadcasts, he did read one of his most enduring and popular short stories, &quot;Ludlow Kissel and the Dago Bomb that Struck Back&quot;, about a neighborhood drunk and his disastrous fireworks escapades. In the 1960s and 1970s, his WOR show ran from 11:15Â pm to midnight, later changed to 10:15Â pm to 11Â pm, so his &quot;Ludlow Kissel&quot; reading was synchronized to many New Jersey and New York local town fireworks displays, which would typically reach their climax at 10Â pm. It was possible, on one of those July 4 nights, to park one&#x27;s car on a hilltop and watch several different pyrotechnic displays, accompanied by Shepherd&#x27;s storytelling.

===Print===

Shepherd wrote a series of humorous short stories about growing up in northwest Indiana and its steel towns, many of which were first told by him on his programs and then published in &quot;Playboy&quot;. The stories were later assembled into books titled &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot;, &quot;Wanda Hickey&#x27;s Night of Golden Memories: And Other Disasters&quot;, &quot;The Ferrari in the Bedroom&quot;, and &quot;A Fistful of Fig Newtons&quot;. Some of those situations were incorporated into his movies and television fictional stories. He also wrote a column for the early &quot;Village Voice&quot;, a column for &quot;Car and Driver&quot;, numerous individual articles for diverse publications, including &quot;Mad Magazine&quot; (&quot;The Night People vs. Creeping Meatballism&quot;, March/April 1957), and introductions for books such as &quot;The America of George Ade&quot;, &quot;American Snapshots&quot;, and the 1970 reprint of the 1929 &quot;Johnson Smith Catalogue&quot;.

When Eugene B. Bergmann&#x27;s &quot;Excelsior, You Fathead! The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd&quot; was published in 2005, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed:This prismatic portrait affirms Shepherd&#x27;s position as one of the 20th century&#x27;s great humorists. Railing against conformity, he forged a unique personal bond with his loyal listeners, who participated in his legendary literary prank by asking bookstores for the nonexistent novel &quot;I, Libertine&quot; (when publisher Ian Ballantine had Shepherd, author Theodore Sturgeon, and illustrator Frank Kelly Freas make the fake real, &quot;PW&quot; called it &quot;the hoax that became a book&quot;). Storyteller Shepherd&#x27;s grand theme was life itself ... Novelist Bergmann (&quot;Rio Amazonas&quot;) interviewed 32 people who knew Shepherd or were influenced by him and listened to hundreds of broadcast tapes, inserting transcripts of Shepherd&#x27;s own words into a &quot;biographical framework&quot; of exhaustive research.
&quot;Shep&#x27;s Army: Bummers, Blisters, and Boondoggles&quot;, almost three dozen of Jean Shepherd&#x27;s radio stories about the army, transcribed, edited, and introduced by Eugene B. Bergmann, is a book of stories by Shepherd. (Opus Books, August 2013)

===Television and films===

Early in his career, Shepherd had a television program on WLWT in Cincinnati called &quot;Rear Bumper&quot;. He claimed that he was recommended to replace the resigning Steve Allen on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. Shepherd was reportedly brought to New York City by NBC executives to prepare for the position, but they were contractually bound to first offer it to Jack Paar. The network was certain Paar would hold out for a role in prime time, but he accepted the late-night assignment. However, he did not assume the position permanently until Shepherd and Ernie Kovacs had co-hosted the show.

In late 1960 and early 1961, he did a weekly television show, &quot;Inside Jean Shepherd&quot;, on WOR-TV (channel 9) in New York, but it did not last long. Between 1971 and 1994, Shepherd became a screenwriter of note, writing and producing numerous works for both television and cinema, all based on his originally spoken and written stories. He was the writer and narrator of the show &quot;Jean Shepherd&#x27;s America&quot;, produced by Boston Public Television station WGBH for PBS, in which he visited various American locales, and interviewed local people of interest. He used a somewhat similar format for the New Jersey Network TV show &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Pie&quot;.

He wrote and narrated many works, the most famous being the 1983 MGM feature film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;, filmed at A Christmas Story House, which is now considered a holiday classic. Shepherd narrates the film as the adult Ralph Parker, and also has a cameo role playing a man in line at the department store waiting for Santa Claus.

PBS aired several television movies based on Shepherd stories, also featuring the Parker family. These included &quot;The Phantom of the Open Hearth&quot; (1976), which aired as part of the anthology series &quot;Visions&quot;; &quot;The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski&quot; (1985), both as part of the anthology series &quot;American Playhouse&quot;; and &quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss&quot; (1988), a co-production with The Disney Channel. All were narrated by Shepherd, but otherwise featured different casts.

Once Shepherd noticed the amount of money he was making from reruns of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (which was slowly becoming a television tradition), he abandoned television; in 1994, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; director Bob Clark and he returned to the same working-class Cleveland street neighborhood to film a sequel, &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot; (later known as &quot;My Summer Story&quot;), released by MGM in 1994 and (because the 11-year span between films caused almost all the actors to age out of their roles) featuring an almost entirely different cast from the previous film.

===Live performances and recordings===
On Saturday nights for several years, Shepherd broadcast his WOR radio program live from the Limelight CafÃ© in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, and he also performed at many colleges nationwide. His live shows were a perennial favorite at Rutgers to wildly enthusiastic standing-room-only crowds, and Fairleigh Dickinson Universities (he often referred to the latter as &quot;Fairly Ridiculous University&quot; on his WOR show). He performed at Princeton University for over 30 years, beginning in 1956 until 1996, three years before his death. 
He performed before sold-out audiences at Carnegie Hall and Town Hall.

He was also emcee for several important jazz concerts in the late 1950s. Shepherd&#x27;s first known recording, the 1955 Abbott Records album &quot;Jean Shepherd... Into the Unknown with Jazz Music&quot;, featured his short comments interspersed with jazz pieces composed by Mitch Leigh and Art Harris. Shepherd improvised spoken-word narration for the title track on jazz musician Charles Mingus&#x27;s 1957 album &quot;The Clown&quot;. Mingus was a fan of Shepherd&#x27;s radio show and outlined a concept for Shepherd but encouraged him to elaborate and improvise.

Eight record albums of live and studio performances of Shepherd&#x27;s were released between 1955 and 1975. In 1993, Shepherd recorded the opening narration and the voice of the Audio-Animatronics &quot;Father&quot; character for the updated Carousel of Progress attraction at Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom.

===Music===
On some of his broadcasts, he played parts of recordings of such novelty songs as &quot;The Bear Missed the Train&quot; (a parody of the Yiddish ballad &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen&quot;) and &quot;The Sheik of Araby&quot;. Sometimes, Shepherd would accompany the recordings by playing the Jew&#x27;s harp, nose flute, or kazoo, and occasionally even by thumping his knuckles on his head.

The theme song of his show was &quot;Bahn Frei!&quot; by Eduard Strauss. The particular version Shepherd used was a recording by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops, with arrangement by Peter Bodge, released in April 1946 by RCA Victor-Red Seal. This arrangement recast the 19th-century polka from one relating to travel by train to a fast-tempo piece directed to horses and a race track, principally achieved by opening with a well-known bugle call named &quot;Call to the Post&quot;.

==Personal life==

When discussing his personal life, Shepherd was evasive to the point of being intentionally misleading about the actual details. To what extent Shepherd&#x27;s radio and published stories were fact, fiction, or a combination of the two is unknown. The childhood friends included in many of his stories were people he claimed to have invented, yet high-school yearbooks and numerous other sources confirm that many of them, including school buddies &quot;Flick&quot; and &quot;Schwartz&quot;, did indeed exist. His father was a cashier at the Borden Milk Company; Shepherd always referred to him as &quot;the old man&quot;. During an interview on the &quot;Long John Nebel Show&quot;an all-night radio program that ran on WOR starting at midnightShepherd once claimed that his real father was a cartoonist along the lines of Herblock, and that he inherited his skills at line drawings. This may well have not been true, but Shepherd&#x27;s ink drawings do adorn some of his published writings, and a number of previously unknown ones were sold on eBay from the collection of his former wife Lois Nettleton after her death in 2008.

The 1930 Federal Census Record for Hammond, Indiana, indicates that Jean&#x27;s father did work for a dairy company; his occupation reads &quot;cashier&quot;. The 1930 census record lists these family members: Jean Shepherd, age 30, head; Anna Shepherd, age 30, wife; Jean Shepherd Jr, age 8, son; and Randall Shepherd, age 6, son. According to this record, Jean Sr., Anna, Jean Jr., and Randall were all born in Illinois, and Jean Sr.&#x27;s parents (Emmett and Flora) were born in Kansas. However, all other decennial federal and state census records, as well as other official documents such as death certificates, indicate that Emmett and Flora were born in Indiana. Anna&#x27;s parents, August and Katherine, were born in Germany.

Shepherd lived in several New York City locations during his WOR days and for a time in New Milford, New Jersey, and in Washington Township, Warren County, New Jersey.

Shepherd was married four times. He was briefly married in 1947 to Barbara Mattoon in Hammond. Shepherd had two children, a son Randall and daughter Adrian, with his second wife, Laverne Warner. (He publicly denied this, including in his last will and testament, executed some five months prior to his death.) Randall has said that Shepherd left his mother shortly before they divorced in 1957; he had almost no contact with his father after his parents&#x27; divorce. Shepherd&#x27;s third wife was actress Lois Nettleton. In 1984, he moved to Sanibel Island, Florida, with his fourth wife, Leigh Brown.

Shepherd died in a hospital in Fort Myers, Florida, in 1999, of natural causes.

==Legacy==

Shepherd&#x27;s oral narrative style was a to that used by Spalding Gray and Garrison Keillor. Marshall McLuhan in &quot;Understanding Media&quot; wrote that Shepherd &quot;regards radio as a new medium for a new kind of novel that he writes nightly.&quot; In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season-six DVD set, commenting on the episode titled &quot;The Gymnast&quot;, Jerry Seinfeld said, &quot;He really formed my entire comedic sensibilityI learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.&quot; Seinfeld was interviewed at a tribute to Shepherd held at the Paley Center for Media on January 23, 2012, confirming the importance of Shepherd on his career and discussing how he and Shepherd had similar ways of humorously discussing minor incidents in life. The first name of Seinfeld&#x27;s third child is &quot;Shepherd.&quot;

Shepherd&#x27;s life and multimedia career are examined in the 2005 book &quot;Excelsior, You Fathead! The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd&quot; by Eugene B. Bergmann.

Shepherd&#x27;s 7-step approach to &quot;compassionate humor&quot; in storytelling is described in the appendix to the 2024 book &quot;You&#x27;ll Shoot Your Eye Out! Life Lessons from the Movie A Christmas Story&quot;, by writer and communication professor Quentin Schultze, who taught with Shepherd.

Shepherd was an influence on Bill Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Zippy&quot; comic strip, as Griffith noted in his strip for January 9, 2000. Griffith explained, &quot;The inspirationjust plucking random memories from my childhood, as I&#x27;m wont to do in my Sunday strip (also a way to expand beyond Zippy)and Shep was a big part of them&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Steely Dan&#x27;s Donald Fagen says that the eponymous figure from his solo album &quot;The Nightfly&quot; was based on Jean Shepherd. Fagen devoted a chapter of his autobiography, &quot;Eminent Hipsters&quot;, to Shepherd.

Though he primarily spent his radio career playing music, New York Top-40 DJ Dan Ingram has acknowledged Shepherd&#x27;s style as an influence.

An article Shepherd wrote for &quot;MAD&quot; issue no. 32 (March-April 1957), &quot;The Night People vs Creeping Meatballism&quot;, described the differences between what he considered to be &quot;day people&quot; (conformists) and &quot;night people&quot; (nonconformists). The opening credits of John Cassavetes&#x27; 1959 film &quot;Shadows&quot; include &quot;Presented by Jean Shepherd&#x27;s Night People&quot;.

In 2005, Shepherd was posthumously inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, and in November 2013, he was posthumously inducted into the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame.

<doc id="576387" wikidata="Q5450398" url="?curid=576387" title="Finite field arithmetic">
<text>In mathematics, finite field arithmetic is arithmetic in a finite field (a field containing a finite number of elements) contrary to arithmetic in a field with an infinite number of elements, like the field of rational numbers.

There are infinitely many different finite fields. Their number of elements is necessarily of the form &quot;pn&quot; where &quot;p&quot; is a prime number and &quot;n&quot; is a positive integer, and two finite fields of the same size are isomorphic. The prime &quot;p&quot; is called the characteristic of the field, and the positive integer &quot;n&quot; is called the dimension of the field over its prime field.

Finite fields are used in a variety of applications, including in classical coding theory in linear block codes such as BCH codes and ReedâSolomon error correction, in cryptography algorithms such as the Rijndael (AES) encryption algorithm, in tournament scheduling, and in the design of experiments.

==Effective polynomial representation==
The finite field with &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; elements is denoted GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;) and is also called the Galois field of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;, in honor of the founder of finite field theory, Ãvariste Galois. GF(&quot;p&quot;), where &quot;p&quot; is a prime number, is simply the ring of integers modulo &quot;p&quot;. That is, one can perform operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) using the usual operation on integers, followed by reduction modulo &quot;p&quot;. For instance, in GF(5), is reduced to 2 modulo 5. Division is multiplication by the inverse modulo &quot;p&quot;, which may be computed using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

A particular case is GF(2), where addition is exclusive OR (XOR) and multiplication is AND. Since the only invertible element is 1, division is the identity function.

Elements of GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;) may be represented as polynomials of degree strictly less than &quot;n&quot; over GF(&quot;p&quot;). Operations are then performed modulo &quot;m(x)&quot; where &quot;m(x)&quot; is an irreducible polynomial of degree &quot;n&quot; over GF(&quot;p&quot;), for instance using polynomial long division. Addition is the usual addition of polynomials, but the coefficients are reduced modulo &quot;p&quot;. Multiplication is also the usual multiplication of polynomials, but with coefficients multiplied modulo &quot;p&quot; and polynomials multiplied modulo the polynomial &quot;m(x)&quot;. This representation in terms of polynomial coefficients is called a monomial basis (a.k.a. &#x27;polynomial basis&#x27;).

There are other representations of the elements of GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;); some are isomorphic to the polynomial representation above and others look quite different (for instance, using matrices). Using a normal basis may have advantages in some contexts.

When the prime is 2, it is conventional to express elements of GF(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;) as binary numbers, with the coefficient of each term in a polynomial represented by one bit in the corresponding element&#x27;s binary expression. Braces ( &quot;{&quot; and &quot;}&quot; ) or similar delimiters are commonly added to binary numbers, or to their hexadecimal equivalents, to indicate that the value gives the coefficients of a basis of a field, thus representing an element of the field. For example, the following are equivalent representations of the same value in a characteristic 2 finite field:

== Primitive polynomials ==
There are many irreducible polynomials (sometimes called reducing polynomials) that can be used to generate a finite field, but they do not all give rise to the same representation of the field.

A monic irreducible polynomial of degree having coefficients in the finite field GF(), where for some prime and positive integer , is called a primitive polynomial if all of its roots are primitive elements of GF(). In the polynomial representation of the finite field, this implies that is a primitive element. There is at least one irreducible polynomial for which is a primitive element. In other words, for a primitive polynomial, the powers of generate every nonzero value in the field.

In the following examples it is best not to use the polynomial representation, as the meaning of changes between the examples. The monic irreducible polynomial over GF(2) is not primitive. Let be a root of this polynomial (in the polynomial representation this would be ), that is, . Now , so is not a primitive element of GF(28) and generates a multiplicative subgroup of order 51. The monic irreducible polynomial over GF(2) is primitive, and all 8 roots are generators of .

All GF(28) have a total of 128 generators (see Number of primitive elements), and for a primitive polynomial, 8 of them are roots of the reducing polynomial. Having as a generator for a finite field is beneficial for many computational mathematical operations.

==Addition and subtraction==
Addition and subtraction are performed by adding or subtracting two of these polynomials together, and reducing the result modulo the characteristic.

In a finite field with characteristic 2, addition modulo 2, subtraction modulo 2, and XOR are identical. Thus,

Under regular addition of polynomials, the sum would contain a term 2&quot;x&quot;6. This term becomes 0&quot;x&quot;6 and is dropped when the answer is reduced modulo 2.

Here is a table with both the normal algebraic sum and the characteristic 2 finite field sum of a few polynomials:

In computer science applications, the operations are simplified for finite fields of characteristic 2, also called GF(2&quot;n&quot;) Galois fields, making these fields especially popular choices for applications.

==Multiplication==

Multiplication in a finite field is multiplication modulo an irreducible reducing polynomial used to define the finite field. (I.e., it is multiplication followed by division using the reducing polynomial as the divisorâthe remainder is the product.) The symbol &quot;â¢&quot; may be used to denote multiplication in a finite field.

=== Rijndael&#x27;s (AES) finite field ===
Rijndael (standardised as AES) uses the characteristic 2 finite field with 256 elements, which can also be called the Galois field GF(28). It employs the following reducing polynomial for multiplication:

:&quot;x&quot;8 + &quot;x&quot;4 + &quot;x&quot;3 + &quot;x&quot; + 1.

For example, {53} â¢ {CA} = {01} in Rijndael&#x27;s field because

and

The latter can be demonstrated through long division (shown using binary notation, since it lends itself well to the task. Notice that exclusive OR is applied in the example and not arithmetic subtraction, as one might use in grade-school long division.):
 11111101111110 (mod) 100011011
 ^100011011 
 01110000011110
 ^100011011 
 0110110101110
 ^100011011 
 010101110110
 ^100011011 
 00100011010
 ^100011011 
 000000001

(The elements {53} and {CA} are multiplicative inverses of one another since their product is 1.)

Multiplication in this particular finite field can also be done using a modified version of the &quot;peasant&#x27;s algorithm&quot;. Each polynomial is represented using the same binary notation as above. Eight bits is sufficient because only degrees 0 to 7 are possible in the terms of each (reduced) polynomial.

This algorithm uses three variables (in the computer programming sense), each holding an eight-bit representation. a and b are initialized with the multiplicands; p accumulates the product and must be initialized to 0.

At the start and end of the algorithm, and the start and end of each iteration, this invariant is true: a b + p is the product. This is obviously true when the algorithm starts. When the algorithm terminates, a or b will be zero so p will contain the product.

* Run the following loop eight times (once per bit). It is OK to stop when a or b is zero before an iteration:
*# If the rightmost bit of b is set, exclusive OR the product p by the value of a. This is polynomial addition.
*# Shift b one bit to the right, discarding the rightmost bit, and making the leftmost bit have a value of zero. This divides the polynomial by x, discarding the &quot;x&quot;0 term.
*# Keep track of whether the leftmost bit of a is set to one and call this value carry.
*# Shift a one bit to the left, discarding the leftmost bit, and making the new rightmost bit zero. This multiplies the polynomial by x, but we still need to take account of carry which represented the coefficient of &quot;x&quot;7.
*# If carry had a value of one, exclusive or a with the hexadecimal number codice_1 (00011011 in binary). codice_1 corresponds to the irreducible polynomial with the high term eliminated. Conceptually, the high term of the irreducible polynomial and carry add modulo 2 to 0.
* p now has the product

This algorithm generalizes easily to multiplication over other fields of characteristic 2, changing the lengths of a, b, and p and the value codice_1 appropriately.

==Multiplicative inverse==
The multiplicative inverse for an element a of a finite field can be calculated a number of different ways:

* By multiplying a by every number in the field until the product is one. This is a brute-force search.
* Since the nonzero elements of GF(&quot;pn&quot;) form a finite group with respect to multiplication, (for ), thus the inverse of &quot;a&quot; is &quot;a&quot;. This algorithm is a generalization of the modular multiplicative inverse based on Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.
* Multiplicative inverse based on the Fermat&#x27;s little theorem can also be interpreted using the multiplicative Norm function in finite field. This new viewpoint leads to an inverse algorithm based on the additive Trace function in finite field.
* By using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
* By making logarithm and exponentiation tables for the finite field, subtracting the logarithm from &quot;pn&quot;Â âÂ 1 and exponentiating the result.
* By making a modular multiplicative inverse table for the finite field and doing a lookup.
* By mapping to a composite field where inversion is simpler, and mapping back.
* By constructing a special integer (in case of a finite field of a prime order) or a special polynomial (in case of a finite field of a non-prime order) and dividing it by &quot;a&quot;.

==Implementation tricks==
===Generator based tables===
When developing algorithms for Galois field computation on small Galois fields, a common performance optimization approach is to find a generator &quot;g&quot; and use the identity:

:formula_1

to implement multiplication as a sequence of table look ups for the log&quot;g&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) and &quot;g&quot;&quot;y&quot; functions and an integer addition operation. This exploits the property that every finite field contains generators. In the Rijndael field example, the polynomial (or {03}) is one such generator. A necessary but not sufficient condition for a polynomial to be a generator is to be irreducible.

An implementation must test for the special case of &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; being zero, as the product will also be zero.

This same strategy can be used to determine the multiplicative inverse with the identity:

:formula_2

This requires two table look ups, an integer multiplication and an integer modulo operation. Again a test for the special case must be performed.

However, in cryptographic implementations, one has to be careful with such implementations since the cache architecture of many microprocessors leads to variable timing for memory access. This can lead to implementations that are vulnerable to a timing attack.

===Carryless multiply===
For binary fields GF(2&quot;n&quot;), field multiplication can be implemented using a carryless multiply such as CLMUL instruction set, which is good for &quot;n&quot; â¤ 64. A multiplication uses one carryless multiply to produce a product (up to 2&quot;n&quot; â 1 bits), another carryless multiply of a pre-computed inverse of the field polynomial to produce a quotient = âproduct / (field polynomial)â, a multiply of the quotient by the field polynomial, then an xor: result = product â ((field polynomial) âproduct / (field polynomial)â). The last 3 steps (pclmulqdq, pclmulqdq, xor) are used in the Barrett reduction step for fast computation of CRC using the x86 pclmulqdq instruction.

===Composite exponent===
When &quot;k&quot; is a composite number, there will exist isomorphisms from a binary field GF(2&quot;k&quot;) to an extension field of one of its subfields, that is, GF((2&quot;m&quot;)&quot;n&quot;) where . Utilizing one of these isomorphisms can simplify the mathematical considerations as the degree of the extension is smaller with the trade off that the elements are now represented over a larger subfield. To reduce gate count for hardware implementations, the process may involve multiple nesting, such as mapping from GF(28) to GF(((22)2)2).

== Program examples ==
=== C programming example ===
Here is some C code which will add and multiply numbers in the characteristic 2 finite field of order 28, used for example by Rijndael algorithm or ReedâSolomon, using the Russian peasant multiplication algorithm:
/* Add two numbers in the GF(2^8) finite field */
uint8_t gadd(uint8_t a, uint8_t b) {
 return a ^ b;

/* Multiply two numbers in the GF(2^8) finite field defined 
 * by the modulo polynomial relation x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 = 0
 * (the other way being to do carryless multiplication followed by a modular reduction)
uint8_t gmul(uint8_t a, uint8_t b) {
 uint8_t p = 0; /* accumulator for the product of the multiplication */
 while (a != 0 &amp;&amp; b != 0) {
 if (b &amp; 1) /* if the polynomial for b has a constant term, add the corresponding a to p */
 p ^= a; /* addition in GF(2^m) is an XOR of the polynomial coefficients */

 if (a &amp; 0x80) /* GF modulo: if a has a nonzero term x^7, then must be reduced when it becomes x^8 */
 a = (a Â« 1) ^ 0x11b; /* subtract (XOR) the primitive polynomial x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1 (0b1_0001_1011) â you can change it but it must be irreducible */
 else
 a Â«= 1; /* equivalent to a*x */
 b Â»= 1;
 return p;


This example has cache, timing, and branch prediction side-channel leaks, and is not suitable for use in cryptography.

=== D programming example ===
This D program will multiply numbers in Rijndael&#x27;s finite field and generate a PGM image:
Multiply two numbers in the GF(2^8) finite field defined
by the polynomial x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1.
ubyte gMul(ubyte a, ubyte b) pure nothrow {
 ubyte p = 0;

 foreach (immutable ubyte counter; 0 .. 8) {
 p ^= -(b &amp; 1) &amp; a;
 auto mask = -((a Â» 7) &amp; 1);
 // 0b1_0001_1011 is x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1.
 a = cast(ubyte)((a Â« 1) ^ (0b1_0001_1011 &amp; mask));
 b Â»= 1;

 return p;

void main() {
 import std.stdio, std.conv;
 enum width = ubyte.max + 1, height = width;

 auto f = File(&quot;rijndael_finite_field_multiplication.pgm&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;);
 f.writefln(&quot;P5\n%d %d\n255&quot;, width, height);
 foreach (immutable y; 0 .. height)
 foreach (immutable x; 0 .. width) {
 immutable char c = gMul(x.to!ubyte, y.to!ubyte);
 f.write(c);
}

This example does not use any branches or table lookups in order to avoid side channels and is therefore suitable for use in cryptography.

<text>Pierre Dugua de Mons (or Du Gua de Monts; â 1628) was a French merchant, explorer and colonizer. A Calvinist, he was born in the ChÃ¢teau de Mons, in Royan, Saintonge (southwestern France) and founded the first permanent French settlement in Canada. He was Lieutenant General of New France from 1603 to 1610. He travelled to northeastern North America for the first time in 1599 with Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit.

== Biography ==
Pierre Dugua de Mons was born about 1558 in Saintonge, France to Guy and Claire Goumard Dugua. He fought for the cause of Henri IV during the religious wars in France. The king later awarded him an annual pension of 1,200 crowns and the governorship of the town of Pons in Saintonge in recognition of his outstanding service.

De Mons seems to have made several voyages to Canada including in 1600, with Pierre de Chauvin de Tonnetuit to Tadoussac. In 1603, King Henry granted Dugua exclusive right to colonize lands in North America between 40Â°â60Â° North latitude. The King also gave Du Gua a monopoly in the fur trade for these territories and named him Lieutenant General for Acadia and New France. In return, Du Gua promised to bring 60 new colonists each year.

In 1604, Du Gua organized an expedition, underwritten by merchants in Rouen, Saint-Malo, and La Rochelle, and left France with 79 settlers including FranÃ§ois GravÃ© Du Pont as senior officer, Royal cartographer Samuel de Champlain, the Baron de Poutrincourt, a priest Nicolas Aubry, and Mathieu de Costa: a legendary linguist, the first registered black man to set foot in North America, and a Protestant member of the clergy.

Entering &quot;Baie FranÃ§aise&quot; (the Bay of Fundy) in June 1604, he and his settlers founded a colony on St. Croix Island. Numerous settlers succumbed to the harsh winter climate and scurvy as they exhausted the limited natural resources on the island. The colony moved to better land on the south shore of Baie FranÃ§aise at Port-Royal in 1605.

Following the disaster of the Saint Croix settlement in the winter of 1604â1605, the French began to look for a more hospitable location for a colony. During this time, they encountered Native Americans along the northeastern coast of the continent, and also had a pair of Native guides in their party, the man who is named as Panounias, and his wife who came from the part of the country they were exploring. Travelling along the coast, Samuel de Champlain is given to have recounted their meetings with the natives, noting when the languages between the groups began to vary. Also, it was noted that the Natives who lived in this area also practised cultivation, particularly methods of farming that were new to the French explorers. It was from these signs and the trading that occurred between the French and the natives that the explorers felt as though they were on the correct track, for if the Natives were living off of this land, this area offered far more hope than Saint Croix Island ever did.

In 1606, Hendrick Lonck, the Dutch West India Company sea captain boarded two of Du Gua&#x27;s boats, and pillaged them for furs and munitions. The Port-Royal settlement survived and prospered somewhat until 1607 when other merchants protested the monopoly, which the King had to revoke. As a consequence, Du Gua and the settlers had to abandon the colony and return to France.

Dugua then turned his attention to the colony of Nouvelle-France in the St. Lawrence River valley, after ceding Port-Royal to Poutrincourt. He never came back to the New World but he sent Champlain to open a colony at Quebec in 1608, thus playing a major role in the foundation of the first permanent French colony in North America.

Henri IV appointed him as Governor of the Protestant city of Pons, Charente-Maritime, from 1610 to 1617, when he retired. He then oversaw the construction of the monumental grand staircase along the ramparts near the Keep of Pons. This 6-level staircase connected the once segregated upper city to the lower city. He died in 1628, in the nearby ChÃ¢teau d&#x27;Ardenne in FlÃ©ac-sur-Seugne.

<text>Scope (previously known as the National Spastics Society) is a disability charity in England and Wales that campaigns to change negative attitudes about disability, provides direct services, and educates the public. The organisation was founded in 1952 by a group of parents and social workers who wanted to ensure that their disabled children had the right to a decent education. Originally focused on cerebral palsy, Scope now embraces all conditions and impairment. Scope subscribes to the social model of disability rather than the medical model of disability â that a person is disabled by the barriers placed in front of them by society, not because of their condition or impairment.

==History==
Scope was founded as the National Spastics Society on 9 October 1951 by Ian Dawson-Shepherd, Eric Hodgson, Alex Moira and a social worker, Jean Garwood, with the aim of improving and expanding services for people with cerebral palsy.

From 1955 to 1989, the society ran the Thomas Delarue School, a specialist secondary boarding school at Tonbridge, Kent. Scope ran several other schools until they were transferred to another organisation in 2018.

Over time, thanks in large part to the influence of Bill Hargreaves, the first trustee with cerebral palsy, the charity&#x27;s aims extended to improving and expanding services for people with cerebral palsy and disabled people in general. Bill&#x27;s pioneering work in employment in the 1950s supported over 1,500 disabled people into their first jobs. In 1962, he set up the 62 Clubs where disabled people could choose and control their own leisure activities. Through its employment services, Scope continues to support disabled people to have the same opportunities as everyone else.

In 1963, the organisation merged with the British Council for the Welfare of Spastics to become The Spastics Society. The Spastics Society provided sheltered workshops and day centres for people with cerebral palsy (commonly referred to as &quot;spastics&quot; at the time, despite spasticity being a symptom of only one variant of cerebral palsy), who were seen as being unemployable in mainstream society. The Society provided residential units and schools, as well as opening a chain of charity shops.

The term &quot;spastic&quot; had long been used as a general playground insult, so in 1994 the organisation changed its name to Scope.
In November 1996, Scope AGM voted in favour of an individual membership scheme to give a voice to the 20,000 people that Scope and its local groups are in contact with every year â the first major UK disability charity to do so. In 1998, Scope individual members voted in elections to Executive Council.

In 2017, Scope launched its new strategy â Everyday equality â which set out how the charity would campaign to support disabled people. The strategy sets out an ambition to offer information, support and advice to two million disabled people and their families every year.

In 2018 Scope transferred 51 services, 31 care homes, 10 day services, and 1,300 staff to Salutem Healthcare as part of a major shift away from service provision.

==Campaigns==

In 2004 Scope launched the &quot;Time to Get Equal&quot; campaign to reduce disablism, which it defines as &quot;discriminatory, oppressive or abusive behaviour arising from the belief that disabled people are inferior to others&quot;.

In 2014 Scope ran a campaign called &quot;End The Awkward&quot; fronted by comedian Alex Brooker. The campaign used comedy to shine a light on the awkwardness that many people feel about disability. Scope&#x27;s &quot;End The Awkward&quot; campaign continued in 2015 when Scope teamed up with Channel 4 to run a series of short films entitled &quot;What Not to Do,&quot; which demonstrated how not to behave in situations including a blind date, a job interview and at the hairdressers. Scope also created an A-Z of sex and disability.

In 2016 Scope launched its third year of &quot;End The Awkward&quot; where it introduced its H.I.D.E. concept â a mnemonic which stands for: Say &#x27;Hi&#x27;; Introduce yourself; Don&#x27;t panic; End the awkward â to encourage people to talk to disabled people rather than avoid them.

In 2017 Scope partnered with Virgin Media to run their &quot;Work With Me&quot; and &quot;Support To Work&quot; efforts, providing online advice and support for disabled people seeking work.

== Publications ==
&quot;N.S.S. news: the monthly magazine of the National Spastics Society&quot;, was published from 1953 to 1958 and became &quot;Spastics news: magazine of the National Spastics Society&quot;, which ran from 1958 to 1984. It then became &quot;Disability Now&quot;, which ran from 1984 until 2012, when it ceased publication.

<doc id="576403" wikidata="Q222764" url="?curid=576403" title="Renault MÃ©gane">
<text>The Renault MÃ©gane (), also spelled without the acute accent as Megane, especially in languages other than French, and also known as the Renault Megavan for an LCV in Ireland, as the [[Renault Scala]] in Iran and as the Renault MÃ©gane GrandcoupÃ© for the saloon in Israel, Palestinian Authority and Serbia for certain generations, is a small family car produced by the French car manufacturer Renault for the 1996 model year, and was the successor to the Renault 19. The MÃ©gane has been offered in three- and five-door hatchback, saloon, coupÃ©, convertible and estate bodystyles at various points in its lifetime, and having been through four generations is now in its fifth incarnation.

The first generation was largely based on its predecessor, the 19, and utilized modified versions of that car&#x27;s drivetrain and chassis. The second and third generations were based on the RenaultâNissan C platform. The fourth generation is based on the CMF-CD platform, as used by the Renault Talisman and Renault ScÃ©nic.

In November 1996, the MÃ©gane ScÃ©nic compact MPV was introduced, using the same mechanical components as the hatchback MÃ©gane. For 2002, the MÃ©gane entered its second generation with a substantial redesign taking place, and was voted European Car of the Year for 2003, whilst also becoming the first car in its class to receive a five star Euro NCAP rating.

The MÃ©gane entered its third generation in 2008, with another totally different design being used; the saloon version of the MÃ©gane became known as the Renault Fluence for this generation, and it was introduced in 2009. The fourth-generation MÃ©gane was launched in 2015, with sales commencing in 2016.

In 2021, Renault revealed a battery electric version known as the Megane E-Tech Electric, which takes on a crossover exterior design.

==First generation (X64; 1995)==

Development of the X64 began at the beginning of 1990, with the first sketches of X64 programme being drawn during the first six months of 1990. Very quickly, several themes were outlined and developed into four small scale (1/5) models by September 1990. The MÃ©gane name was coined by Manfred Gotta.

The designs retained were developed around four themes. Theme A: a six light version, evoking the Laguna; Theme B: a model with a markedly cuneiform line; Theme C: another design with ellipse shaped glasswork and rear notch; Theme D: a model with the same elliptical glazing and rounded rear.
In March 1991, all four styling proposals were developed into full scale (1:1). Theme C by Michel Jardin was chosen by Le Quement and frozen for production in April 1992. The first prototypes were built and presented to management in December 1992. Approximately 432 prototypes were built (at Rueil assembly) and destroyed during development.

In June 1993, Renault purchased production tooling for the X64, with the first test unit being assembled at the Douai plant in October 1994, and pre production units being constructed from December 1994 to the middle of 1995.

The MÃ©gane I was unveiled in September 1995, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, as a replacement for the Renault 19. The car was essentially a reskin of its predecessor, and carried over the 19&#x27;s floorpan, engines, transmissions and chassis design, albeit with much modification.

Taking its name from a Renault concept car shown in 1988, the MÃ©gane further developed the new corporate styling theme introduced by Patrick Le QuÃ©ment on the Laguna, most notably the &quot;bird beak&quot; front grille â a styling cue borrowed from the Renault 16 of the 1960s. Renault decided to add an acute accent to the vehicle name (MÃ©gane), in order to assert its European identity, in a context of growing competition of newer car manufacturers coming from Japan.

As with the 19 and the 11 before it, the MÃ©gane was produced at Renault&#x27;s Douai plant in northern France starting in July 1995, and at the Spanish plant of Palencia. Market launch began on 15 November 1995 in France, and 15 December 1995 for the coupÃ©. Sales in the United Kingdom commenced in April 1996.

Safety was a key focus of the MÃ©gane I, Renault&#x27;s first car reflecting their new focus of selling on safety.

It featured a pillar mounted three-point seatbelt for the middle rear occupant (replacing the common &#x27;lap strap&#x27;), standard front belt pre tensioners and load limiters, driver&#x27;s airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive safety structure â a specification ahead of all rivals in 1995, e.g. VW Golf Mk 3, Opel Astra F, Ford Escort etc. Some features, such as the three-point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the MÃ©gane).

The car also benefited from Renault&#x27;s first &quot;System for Restraint and Protection&quot; (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, pretensioner, load limiter and airbag. The MÃ©gane I achieved a best in class four star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by Euro NCAP.

November 1996 saw the introduction of the MÃ©gane ScÃ©nic compact MPV.

Power came from the Renault E type (&quot;Energy&quot;) engine in 1.4Â L and 1.6Â L, and the F-type unit in both 1.9Â L diesel and 2.0Â L petrol forms, although this time around there was a wider variety of 16 valve derivatives. A 1.9Â L diesel engine in both normally aspirated and turbocharged forms was also available.

Renault also produced a limited number of Renaultsport edition Phase 1&#x27;s with the Renaultsport bodywork; however, these were very rare. The Renaultsport kit was available to purchase for a short time direct from Renault France, but has now been discontinued, thus their value has increased.

The estate version of the original MÃ©gane was only available in LHD form, with no RHD variants built. This could be due to the greater popularity of the Scenic in those markets, limiting the potential sales of a compact estate. The estate was added with the facelift of 1999, although pre-facelifted MÃ©gane estates were sold from September 1998 in Turkey, where it was manufactured by Oyak-Renault.

In Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by Yanase Co., Ltd., but in 1999 Renault acquired a stake in Japanese automaker Nissan. As a result of Renault&#x27;s purchase, Yanase canceled its licensing contract for all Renault models sold in Japan, including, but not limited to, the MÃ©gane I, in 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee for Renault cars.

===Facelift===
A mild facelift in spring 1999 gave the MÃ©gane I a modified grille, more advanced safety features and upgraded equipment, and 16 valve engines were used across the range. An Estate body style was also launched in mainland Europe with the facelift. The production continued for the Latin America Market, where it was sold alongside the MÃ©gane II line at a considerably lower price until 2011.
===South America===
In countries, such as Argentina and Colombia, the MÃ©gane I was available until 2010, sold as a sedan and an estate, but in Venezuela, it was available only as a sedan. It features as the top line of the model the LA04 engine (16 valves, 1.6 litres and 110 HP), and was produced by both Renault Colombia and Renault Argentina, in where it was one of the best selling cars to date.

It is a car with more advanced safety features, upgraded equipment and more. The MÃ©gane I had a lower price than the MÃ©gane II.

In Venezuela, it was only available in one version: Unique, with a five-speed manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic one. Both of these were equipped with Abs and other extra equipment including driver and passenger front airbags, foglights, leather seats, electric mirrors and electric windows. In Argentina, not every version had features such as electric windows, electric mirrors or airbags.

===Maxi MÃ©gane===
During the 1990s, Renault Sport developed a rally car for the Formula 2 Kit Car regulations. This was the Clio Williams Maxi, which was the first car truly developed for the F2 Kit Car category, and first appeared in 1996. However, rivals such as CitroÃ«n and Peugeot soon introduced bigger and more powerful cars, which resulted in Renault producing an F2 version of the MÃ©gane in 1996. The Maxi MÃ©gane officially represented the brand in French Championship rallies in 1996 and 1997 with drivers like Philippe Bugalski, Jean Ragnotti or Serge Jordan, and the British Rally Championship from 1996 to 1999, with GrÃ©goire De MÃ©vius, Alain Oreille, Robbie Head, Martin Rowe, and Tapio Laukkanen. Both the French and British rally teams also compete in the World Rally Championship.

After the works programme was discontinued, many privateers continued to use the car. It was also used in the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup, which Renault won in 1999. The car used a special version of the Renault F7R engine, and had a seven speed Sequential manual transmission.

Its most notable result was an outright victory in the 1996 Tour de Corse in the hands of Philippe Bugalski and his co driver Jean-Paul Chiaroni (in a year where the Tour de Corse was a FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup only event); but it also helped Renault to the FIA 2 Litre World Rally Cup of Manufacturer&#x27;s title in 1999.

In other high level competitions, Renault took back to back manufacturer&#x27;s and driver&#x27;s titles in the British Rally Championship in 1998 and 1999, whilst they also took the European Rally Championship in 1999.

==Second generation (X84; 2002)==


The MÃ©gane II was launched in September 2002 for the 2003 model year, and marked a completely new fresh start. The two cars bear very little resemblance, the new vehicle having been inspired by the manufacturer&#x27;s new design language first seen in the Avantime.

The new MÃ©gane was voted European Car of the Year for 2003, fighting off stiff competition from Japan&#x27;s Mazda3 and PSA&#x27;s CitroÃ«n C3, and achieved a five star safety rating in the Euro NCAP crash tests, the first small family car to do so.

The MÃ©gane II and the Laguna were both showcases for a great deal of innovative technologies Renault launched at the beginning of the 2000s; the Renault Card keyless ignition system, standard on the MÃ©gane II, was a first in this class and has since been widely adopted.

Similarly, the option of a panoramic glass sunroof is another area in which Renault led where others followed. In June 2003, the first ever live crash test using a real driver rather than a crash test dummy featuring the MÃ©gane II was conducted by &quot;Top Gear&quot;.

The MÃ©gane II sedan was assembled in Iran by Pars Khodro from 2008 to 2013.

In Brazil, Renault launched a flex fuel version, called &quot;Hi-Flex&quot;, which is able to run either with unleaded petrol or ethanol. Like the Brazilian ScÃ©nic and Clio versions, the MÃ©gane&#x27;s engine can work with any mix of petrol and ethanol, due to the use of an electronic control module.

The flex version has a 16V , with ethanol, 1.6-litre inline-four engine developed and produced in Brazil, but the 2.0-litre, French-built engine can not be run on ethanol.

As with the previous MÃ©gane, the range of models is wide; there is a three and five door hatchback available, named &quot;Sport Hatch&quot; and &quot;Hatch&quot; respectively, there is a four-door saloon/sedan (Sport Saloon), a five-door estate (Sport Tourer / Grandtour), and to replace both the MÃ©gane Coupe and Convertible, a new retractable hardtop coupe designed by Karmann. Unlike the previous model, the estate version was sold in RHD for the first time. 

Unlike its predecessor, the MÃ©gane II was not licensed by Yanase Co., Ltd. for the Japanese market, as Renault had acquired a stake in Nissan when the MÃ©gane I was still in production. Instead, the MÃ©gane II was licensed by Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. and sold exclusively through &quot;Nissan Red Stage Store&quot; locations.

===MÃ©gane RS===

The RenaultSport (RS) versions of the three door and five door MÃ©gane hatchbacks were introduced, equipped with a turbocharged petrol 2.0Â L 16v engine producing and Turbocharged diesel 2.0L dCi 16V engine producing 175 PS (129Â kW;173Â hp). Along with the engine, changes were made to the front and rear suspension geometry to improve handling, and the model features a deeper, wider front bumper. The MÃ©gane Renault Sport competes in the hot hatch segment of the market.

===Facelift===
The Hatchback model was revised at Motor Show Brussels in January 2006, the Wagon and Convertible model was debut at Geneva Motor Show in March 2006, with changes in interior trim (e.g. a new revised instrument cluster with the speedometer moved to the right and the tachometer moved to the left), specification levels and most notably, a new front nose. A new front suspension system borrowed from the MÃ©gane 2.0 was adopted, improving the driving performance. Also, the Nissan Sentra B16 is based on the platform from 2006 of the Renault MÃ©gane.

===Engines===
===Reception===
During its first full year of sales, the MÃ©gane II topped the French sales charts, with 198,874 registered in 2003. It has also sold very well in Britain, being the nation&#x27;s fourth most popular car in 2005 and the nation&#x27;s fifth most popular car in 2004 and 2006. In 2007, it dipped to eighth place, with just over 55,000 examples being sold.

The MÃ©gane sedan was the best-selling car in Turkey from 2004 to 2006.

===Chinese copy controversy===
The BYD S8, a Chinese convertible, shares a rear design with the Renault MÃ©gane CC.
== Third generation (X95; 2008)==
The third generation was launched in September 2008, to keep the range competitive. In October 2008, both the five door hatchback and MÃ©gane CoupÃ© were officially put on sale. The two models have different designs; the CoupÃ© has a sporty design, while the five door model is more conservative.

A five-door estate version was introduced in June 2009, and was named the Sport Tourer. Another addition to the range came in the form of the CoupÃ© Cabriolet in June 2010. That year also saw the addition of a 1.4 L turbocharged engine being added to the range.

Production of the MÃ©gane&#x27;s saloon derivative, the Fluence, began in Argentina in 2011, at the firm&#x27;s CÃ³rdoba plant. The MÃ©gane III was also made available for sale in Argentina that year, but was produced in Turkey, and imported into the country. In Brazil, the Fluence replaced the MÃ©gane in Renault&#x27;s lineup from 2011 onwards.

===First facelift===
The MÃ©gane III underwent its first facelift in January 2012, which also introduced three new engines; a 1.2Â L turbocharged petrol engine, a new version of the 1.5Â L dCi engine, and a new 1.6Â L dCi engine.
===Second facelift===

Another facelift followed for 2014, with a more powerful version of the 1.2Â L turbocharged engine going on sale, whilst the styling of the hatchback, coupÃ© and estate versions was updated to match Renault&#x27;s new model range.

Later that year, a version of the 2.0Â L turbocharged petrol engine was added to the range.

Higher specification MÃ©gane feature the same 2.0 dCi engine as the MÃ©gane II. After 2015, the 2.0 dCi was no longer offered.

===Turkish production===
MÃ©gane III models produced in Turkey have visual and equipment differences due to cost cutting and factory equipment differences. For example, there are weather stripes on the roof, covering the welds, whereas Spanish-built models have laser welds on the roof. Turkish models can only have sunroof as an option, while Spanish models can only have a glass roof as an option. On Turkish cars, the spare tyre is located under the vehicle rather than inside the trunk. The ride height is higher on Turkish models, adapted for the worser road conditions in Turkey. Only 1.5 diesel and 1.6 petrol engines were offered on Turkish-built models.

There was no digital dash on Turkish-made pre-facelift models. The dashboard on Turkish models also has a different silver trim piece and different air vents, different gauge clusters, different stalks, and the base models have no analog fuel and temperature gauges.
===MÃ©gane GT Line===

The MÃ©gane GT Line is a sporty trim level that is equipped, among other things, with a sports suspension and unique blue paint.
===Special editions===
;MÃ©gane Olympic
The MÃ©gane Olympic is a special edition launched in August 2012 on the occasion of the London 2012 Olympic Games.

;MÃ©gane CoupÃ© Cabriolet Floride
The MÃ©gane Coupe Cabriolet Floride was a special edition convertible in ivory with red and ivory two-tone interior, intended as a tribute to 1960s chic â the name is a reference to the Renault Floride of that era

== Fourth generation (BFB; 2016)==

The fourth generation MÃ©gane was launched at the September 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show, production started late 2015, with sales starting in July 2016. The vehicle is larger and based on an all-new CMF-CD platform shared with the Renault ScÃ©nic and Renault Talisman. The MÃ©gane IV follows the latest design language, which has been seen on the Clio IV, Captur, Espace V and Talisman.

An estate version (MÃ©gane Sport Tourer/Grandtour, codenamed KFB) was revealed at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The four door fastback saloon version called the MÃ©gane Sedan later in July of the same year.
===Technical details===
The fourth generation MÃ©gane is larger and lower than its predecessor. The suspension is made of MacPherson struts on the front and a torsion beam on the rear. Brakes are discs on both axles. The driver can select between five driving modes that change the car set up.

Most MÃ©gane&#x27;s models have a head up display and a seven-inch screen (replaced with an 8.7-inch touchscreen in some trim levels).

Options include adaptive cruise control, automated emergency braking, lane departure warning, speed limit warning, blind spot monitoring, automatic headlights, reversing camera, parking sensors and a hands free parking system.

Speaking about the car, Renault&#x27;s chief designer Laurens van den Acker said, &quot;Renault can produce cars with a Latin skin and a German heart&quot;. It has nine engines available (four petrol and five diesel) with power outputs between and .

===MÃ©gane Sedan===
The MÃ©gane Sedan, launched in July 2016, resembles the Talisman, but with the front section of the MÃ©gane IV hatchback and a fastback like sloping roofline. It has more space for the back seat passengers than the hatchback and a larger boot, with a claimed volume of 508 litre.

It is sold on the African continent, the Middle East, various Eastern Asian and Australian markets. Within Europe, it is offered in several countries including Turkey, Italy, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Serbia, Greece, Georgia and Ireland, but neither France or the United Kingdom.

Depending on the market, there are two petrol engines and three diesel engines offered, with power outputs ranging from 90 to 130Â bhp. Only the mid range engine is suitable to be matched with the dual clutch six speed transmission.

===MÃ©gane GT===

The MÃ©gane GT is a high performance version based on the hatchback model with 1.6-litre I4 diesel and petrol powertrains. As standard, it incorporates a four-wheel steering system (4Control) and dual-clutch automatic gearbox with optional paddle shifting. It also has a slightly different design for the interior and the exterior.

===MÃ©gane R.S.===
The MÃ©gane R.S. was introduced in September 2017 and went on sale in 2018. Based on the hatchback model, it is powered by a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine developed jointly with Nissan, with tweaks made by engineers working from the Renault Formula 1 engine factory in Viry-ChÃ¢tillon, France. The engine produces and torque, with an option of two transmissions, which are six-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch automatic.
====MÃ©gane RS Trophy-R====

Making its public debut on May 24, 2019, at the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix, the MÃ©gane RS Trophy-R is a limited edition based on the regular Trophy.

It was designed to be the fastest front-wheel-drive vehicle to lap the NÃ¼rburgring, and as such it is lighter due to the thinner glass used on the rear doors, a carbon fibre hood, the absence of rear seats combined with lighter front seats, a titanium exhaust and no rear wiper, among other things. To save even more weight, it can be fitted with an optional carbon-ceramic brake kit at the front as well as carbon rims.
====MÃ©gane RS Ultime====
Announced in January 2023, the MÃ©gane RS Ultime is a limited edition available in just 1,976 units, as a reference to the founding year of Renault Sport. All are signed by Laurent Hurgon, a test driver who has broken several lap records in the MÃ©gane RS and was actively involved in the development of the model.

It is the last RS-badged model and made its public debut at the 2023 Tokyo Motor Show, marking the 20th anniversary of the MÃ©gane RS series, which was first introduced in 2003.

Orders opened in March 2023 with a starting price of â¬53,450 (not including the green tax) in France.

===Facelift===
In 2020, the MÃ©gane was refreshed with facelift, with minor changes to the exterior design, a 9.3-inch touchscreen, and a plug-in hybrid version in both estate and hatchback variants marketed as the MÃ©gane E-Tech. It combines the 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with two electric motors for a total system output of and comes with a 9.8 kWh battery that allows it to run on electricity for and up to a top speed of in the mixed WLTP test cycle and for in the city.

The MÃ©gane Sedan is facelifted in February 2021, some months after the hatchback and the estate. It receives a new 115Â hp petrol engine. The hatchback version was discontinued in Turkey.

In June 2022, Renault launched the &quot;E-Tech engineered&quot; special edition for the hybrid versions of the Clio, Captur, Arkana and MÃ©gane (hatchback and estate), with design elements inspired by the Megane E-Tech.

The production of both the hatchback and the estate models is stopped in April 2024, but the production in Turkey (saloon model) continues.

== Fifth generation (Megane E-Tech, 2022) ==
The Megane E-Tech is a battery electric car using the Megane nameplate that was launched in February 2022. It is built on a dedicated electric vehicle platform called the CMF-EV.
== Nameplate usage ==
=== MÃ©gane ScÃ©nic ===
In 1996, a compact MPV called the MÃ©gane ScÃ©nic was introduced. It was renamed to ScÃ©nic during a facelift in 1999.

=== MÃ©gane Conquest ===

In September 2020, the rebadged version of the South Korean-made Renault Samsung XM3/Arkana was launched in former Yugoslavian countries as the MÃ©gane Conquest due to negative connotations with the Serbian historical war criminal Arkan.

<doc id="576409" wikidata="Q58584" url="?curid=576409" title="Baoding">
<text>Baoding is a prefecture-level city in central Hebei province, approximately southwest of Beijing. As of the 2020 census, Baoding City had 11,544,036 inhabitants, of which 2,549,787 lived in the metropolitan area made of 4 out of 5 urban districts: Lianchi, Jingxiu, Qingyuan, and Mancheng all of which are largely conurbated. Accounting for about one-sixth of the population of Hebei Province. Baoding is among 13 Chinese cities with a population of over 10 million, ranking seventh. Zhuozhou City in the northern part has now grown into part of the Beijing metro area.

Baoding was the capital of Zhili Province and the residence of the Viceroy of Zhili in the Qing dynasty. The city was also the capital of Hebei province until 1968, and is now a national historical and cultural city and one of the central cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji cluster, with the Xiong&#x27;an new area located within its jurisdiction.

==Name==
Baoding was known as Shanggu, Baozhou, Shoocheng and Baofu in ancient times. The city&#x27;s name, Baoding (), dates back to the Song and Yuan dynasties, In 1239, the Yuan Dynasty changed the name of Shuntian Army to Shuntian Road, which means &quot;complying with the destiny of heaven&quot;, and Baozhou was named Luzhi. Because Baozhou was the southern gate of the capital in the Yuan Dynasty, Shuntian Road was changed to Baoding Road in 1275, which means &quot;defend the capital and stabilize the world&quot;. The name is roughly interpreted as &quot;protecting the capital&quot;, referring to the city&#x27;s proximity to Beijing.

==History==

Baoding has a history dating back to the Western Han Dynasty.

=== Prehistory ===
The Nanzhuangtou site near Baiyang Lake is one of the earliest Neolithic site discovered in North China, dating back approximately 10,500â9,700 years. Other Neolithic sites in Baoding include Diaoyutai and Beifudi.

===Early history===
During the Warring States period, what is now Baoding was along the dividing line between the Yan and Zhao states.

One of the capitals of Yan during this period, Xiadu, is located in what is now Yi County, and from 400 to 300 BC may have been the largest cities in the world, with an estimated population of over 300,000.

===Imperial era===
In 960 the Song dynasty established the Bao prefecture (&quot;Baozhou&quot;) with the administrative office in Baosai County (modern Baoding). This lasted until 1241, when the Mongol Empire (who conquered the Jin dynasty in 1234) abolished it, incorporating Baozhou into the Central Region.

In the year 1213 the Mongol army invaded and destroyed Baozhou, leaving it in ruins until it was reconstructed in 1227 during the Yuan dynasty. The region acquired the name &quot;Baoding&quot; in 1275.

In 1669, Baoding became the capital of Zhili, ruled over by a Viceroy until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912.

In 1902, Yuan Shikai, then Viceroy, established the Baoding Military Academy.

===Contemporary history===
On August 1, 1949, the People&#x27;s Government of Hebei province was established, Baoding was the capital of the province, and the city of Baoding was a provincial municipality. On August 9, the administrative inspector&#x27;s office of the Baoding district was established, and it was established as the administrative inspector&#x27;s office of the county district.

In May 1958, the capital of Hebei was moved to Tianjin, then back to Baoding in January 1966, to Shijiazhuang in February 1968. In December 1994, the Baoding area merged with Baoding to become a provincial city.

In April 2017, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council announced the decision to transform Baoding&#x27;s Xiong, Rongcheng, and Anxin counties into Xiong&#x27;an New Area, a new development area of national significance, with a focus on innovation, sustainability and quality of life, following the successes of Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and Shanghai&#x27;s Pudong New Area.

==Geography==
Baoding is located in the west-central portion of Hebei province and lies on the North China Plain, with the Taihang Mountains to the west. Bordering prefecture-level cities in the province are Zhangjiakou to the north, Langfang and Cangzhou to the east, and Shijiazhuang and Hengshui to the south. Baoding also borders Beijing to the northeast and Shanxi to the west.

The geographical coordinates of Baoding are between 113Â°40&#x27;-116Â°20&#x27; east longitude and 38Â°10&#x27;-40Â°00&#x27; north latitude.

The western parts are dominated by mountains and hills that are generally more than tall; this area includes parts of Laishui, Yi, Mancheng, Shunping, Tang, and Fuping Counties as well as the entirety of Laiyuan County, occupying 30.6% of the prefecture&#x27;s area. The highest peak is Mount Waitou (), with an elevation of . Moving southeast from this area, one encounters low-lying mountains and hills, taking up 18.9% of the prefecture&#x27;s area. Further to the east lies generally flat terrain of elevation. Here the primary rivers are the Xiaoyi River (), Fu River (), Bao River (), Ping River (), Juma River (), Yishui River (), Tang River (), Cao River (), Zhulong River (), Qingshui River (), and Sha River ().

===Climate===
Baoding has a continental, monsoon-influenced humid continental climate/semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;Dwa/BSk&quot;), characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and generally cold, windy, very dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone. Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature and lack of rainfall. The annual rainfall, about 60% of which falls in July and August alone, is highly variable and not reliable. The average annual runoff is 2.45 billion cubic meters. In the city itself, this amount has averaged to a meagre per annum. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is .

<doc id="576410" wikidata="Q257326" url="?curid=576410" title="La Higuera">
<text>; ) is a small village in Bolivia located in the Province of Vallegrande, in the Department of Santa Cruz. It is situated in the La Higuera Canton (civil parish) belonging to the PucarÃ¡ Municipality.

==Geography==
The village is situated some 150Â km (bee-line) southwest of Santa Cruz de la Sierra and 15 southwest of PucarÃ¡. La Higuera lies at an elevation of 1950 m. Its population (according to the 2001 census) is 119, mainly indigenous GuaranÃ­ people.

==History==

On October 8, 1967, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara was captured by the CIA-assisted Bolivian Army in the nearby ravine &quot;Quebrada del Churo&quot;, ending his campaign to create a continental revolution in South America. Che Guevara was held in the schoolhouse, where he was killed the next day. The body was then brought to Vallegrande, where it was placed on display and afterwards secretly buried under an airstrip.

===Che tourism===
A monument to &quot;El Che&quot; and a memorial in the former schoolhouse are the major tourist attraction for this area. La Higuera is a stop on the &quot;Ruta del Che&quot; (Che Guevara Trail) which was inaugurated in 2004.

<text>The semis () was a small Roman bronze coin that was valued at half an &quot;as&quot;. During the Roman Republic, the &quot;semis&quot; was distinguished by an &#x27;S&#x27; (indicating &quot;semis&quot;) or 6 dots (indicating a theoretical weight of 6 &quot;unciae&quot;). Some of the coins featured a bust of Saturn on the obverse, and the prow of a ship on the reverse.

Initially a cast coin, like the rest of Roman Republican bronzes, it began to be struck from dies shortly before the Second Punic War (218â201 BC).
Following the Augustan Coinage reforms of 23 BC the &quot;semis&quot; became the smallest orichalcum (brass) denomination, having twice the value of a copper &quot;quadrans&quot; and half the value of the copper &quot;as&quot;. Its size and diameter corresponded directly to the &quot;quadrans&quot;, so its value was attained from brass having double the value of copper. The coin was issued infrequently and it ceased to be issued by the time of Hadrian (117â138 AD).

In the early Imperial period, a &quot;semis&quot; could buy a &quot;cerae&quot; (wax writing tablet).

<text>The year 1997 in [[science]] and technology involved many significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* January 17 â Explosion of a Delta II rocket carrying a military GPS payload shortly after liftoff from Cape Canaveral.
* February 13 â Tune-up and repair work on the Hubble Space Telescope is started by astronauts from the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;.
* February 27 â GRB 970228, a highly luminous flash of gamma rays, strikes the Earth for 80 seconds, providing early evidence that gamma-ray bursts occur well beyond the Milky Way.
* March 8 â Complete solar eclipse.
* March 24 â Partial lunar eclipse.
* July 4 â &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; lands on the surface of Mars.
* August 25 â Launch of Explorer 71 of the Explorer program of spacecraft.
* September 2 â Partial solar eclipse.
* September â Total lunar eclipse.
* October 15 â Launch of 10-year &quot;CassiniâHuygens&quot; spacecraft to Saturn.
* October 30 â First successful test flight of the ESA&#x27;s Ariane 5 expendable launch system.

==Aviation==

==Biology==
* February 22 â In Roslin, Scotland, scientists announce that an adult sheep named Dolly has been successfully cloned and was born in July 1996.
* March 4 â United States President Bill Clinton bars federal funding for any research on human cloning.
* March 14 â The widely cited 1973 John/Joan study of gender reassignment of a twin boy who lost his penis to a botched circumcision is exposed as fraudulent. The supposedly successful outcome for &quot;Joan&quot; reported by John Money had been cited as proof that gender was determined by nurture, yet the patient (later revealed as David Reimer) was in fact deeply unhappy and had returned to his original gender by the age of 15, thus indicating the exact opposite thesis.
* April 25 â Scientists announce that human artificial chromosomes have been created.
* July 10 â In London, scientists report their DNA analysis findings from a Neandertal skeleton which support the out of Africa theory of human evolution placing an &quot;African Eve&quot; at 100,000 to 200,000 years ago.
* August â Suzanne Simard and colleagues publish their discovery of carbon transfer between trees.
* November 6 â The discovery of klotho, a gene involved in human aging, is reported.
* November 19 â In Des Moines, Iowa, Bobbi McCaughey gives birth to septuplets in the second known case where all seven babies are born alive, and the first in which all survive infancy.

==Computer science==
* February 7 â Steve Jobs returns to Apple Inc. as a consultant after the company purchases his software startup NeXT.
* May 11 â IBM&#x27;s Deep Blue defeats Garry Kasparov, the first time a computer defeats a chess grand master in a match. Deep Blue has defeated Kasparov before, but has never previously won a match against him.
* September 15 â The domain name for the web search engine Google is registered.

==Earth sciences==
* May 10 â The 7.3 Qayen earthquake shakes eastern Iran with a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (&quot;Extreme&quot;). At least are 1,567 killed and 2,300 injured.

<text>The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) was an executive agency of the British Department for Education from 2013 to 2018. It inherited the responsibilities of the National College for School Leadership (NCSL). The NCTL aimed to improve academic standards by ensuring a well-qualified teaching workforce and supporting schools.

The NCTL also regulated the teaching profession by:

* Prohibiting teachers from working in cases of serious professional misconduct.
* Overseeing teacher inductions.
* Awarding Qualified Teacher Status and Early Years Teacher Status.
In April 2018, the NCTL was dissolved, with its regulatory functions shifting to the Teaching Regulation Agency and its remaining responsibilities absorbed by the Department for Education.

== History ==

The National College for Teaching and Leadership was established on 29 March 2013, from a merge of the National College for School Leadership and the Teaching Agency. Originally, the NCSL was founded in 2000 as a non-departmental public body, but it became an executive agency in 2012.

The college operated a Learning and Conference Centre in Nottingham, designed by Sir Michael Hopkins and located on the Jubilee Campus of the University of Nottingham. Opened in 2002 by Prime Minister Tony Blair, the building cost Â£28 million and was dubbed the &quot;Sandhurst of teachers&quot;.

== Key Activities ==

The NCTL&#x27;s primary activities included:

* Teacher Training Funding: Provided Â£210 million for bursaries and salary contributions to meet recruitment targets.
* STEM Recruitment Projects: Delivered initiatives to attract teachers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
* Teaching Schools Alliances: Supported 576 alliances for school-led training and professional development.
* National Leaders of Education: Designated 1,134 leaders to assist underperforming schools.
* Headship Programs: Sponsored 9,895 participants in leadership qualifications.
* Misconduct Investigations: Managed over 1,000 cases and conducted hearings on teacher misconduct.
* Recruitment Campaigns: Promoted teaching careers through media, TV, and digital campaigns.

== Legacy and Transition ==

Following its dissolution in 2018, the NCTL&#x27;s regulatory functions were transferred to the Teaching Regulation Agency, while broader policy and teacher development responsibilities shifted back to the Department for Education. The closure aimed to streamline oversight and improve efficiency.

<doc id="576423" wikidata="Q1308492" url="?curid=576423" title="Tom Tom Club">
<text>Tom Tom Club is an American new wave band founded in 1981 by husband-and-wife team Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth and as a side project from Talking Heads. Their best known songs include the UK top 10 hit &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot; and the US top 40 hit &quot;Genius of Love&quot;, both from their 1981 debut album, and a cover of The Drifters&#x27; &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; that reached the UK top 30.

==History==
===Formation and debut===
Originally established as a side project from Talking Heads, Tom Tom Club comprised a loose aggregation of musicians, sound engineers, and artists of the Compass Point All Stars family, including Tina Weymouth&#x27;s sisters and guitarist Adrian Belew, the latter of whom toured with Weymouth and Frantz in the expanded version of Talking Heads in 1980 and 1981. Named after the dancehall in the Bahamas where they rehearsed for the first time while on hiatus from Talking Heads in 1980, Tom Tom Club enjoyed early success in the dance club culture of the early 1980s with the hits &quot;Genius of Love&quot; and &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot;, both of which were taken from their self-titled first album released on Sire and Warner Bros. Records in the United States and Island Records elsewhere in 1981. Despite being dismissed by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne for its more commercial direction, the album was a moderate success, peaking at No. 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and certified gold by the RIAA.

&quot;Genius of Love&quot; has been sampled or reinterpreted by many artists, including L&#x27;Trimm, Redman, Funkdoobiest, Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers in &quot;Tumblin&#x27; Down&quot;, the 12&quot; Remix, and Mariah Carey in her hit single &quot;Fantasy&quot; as well as Mark Morrison in &quot;Return of the Mack&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Nasty&quot; (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five was one of the early hip-hop versions of the song; however, it was re-recorded by a live band, as interpolation and not sampling (using the actual original recording) was the more common practice at the time. Another version, &quot;Genius Rap&quot; (1981), by Dr. Jeckyll &amp; Mr. Hyde, was the first cover version. Max B also sampled &quot;Genius of Love&quot; in his single &quot;Get Outta Jail&quot;.

Early British pressings of the first Tom Tom Club album featured shorter versions of &quot;Genius of Love&quot; and &quot;Wordy Rappinghood&quot;, but to capitalize on the club success of these songs, Island Records reissued the album with the full 12-inch versions in 1982. A new single, a cover version of The Drifters&#x27; &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot;, which was the group&#x27;s second and final UK Top 40 hit, replaced another song &quot;Booming and Zooming&quot;. The US version did not contain these modifications until the album was released on compact disc in the 1990s.

&quot;Genius of Love&quot; was featured in the 1984 Talking Heads concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; (filmed in December 1983). Frantz and Weymouth were credited as Tom Tom Club, but in this case the band was simply Talking Heads minus Byrne.

===&quot;Close to the Bone&quot;===
The following year, the group released a follow-up, &quot;Close to the Bone&quot;, which was similar in style to their first album but did not fare as well, though &quot;The Man with the Four Way Hips&quot; was a minor hit on urban radio in the United States. The album was released on cassette and vinyl and was not released on CD until May 2009, as part of a Deluxe Edition package of Tom Tom Club&#x27;s first album. The original British vinyl album was released in six different colors. One of the album&#x27;s singles, &quot;Pleasure of Love&quot;, was sampled in &quot;Turning You On&quot;, by the Treacherous Three. As it happened with &quot;It&#x27;s Nasty&quot;, the sample was re-recorded by a live band rather than just taken from the original recording.

===&quot;Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom&quot; and &quot;Dark Sneak Love Action&quot;===
There was then a four-year gap until the band&#x27;s next album, the first version of &quot;Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom&quot;, released in 1988. By this stage, the band&#x27;s non-US deal with Island had expired and the album was released outside the United States on Fontana/PolyGram. On the album, the group adapted a more conventional rock style with a harder edged sound and a hint of menace in the lyrics of some songs. The group&#x27;s line-up was also solidified along more conventional commercial lines. Whereas the previous two albums had been recorded by a loose collective of a dozen musicians, the band was now reduced to the trio of Weymouth, Frantz, and Weymouth&#x27;s sister Laura Weymouth. Members Bruce Martin and Victoria Clamp were part of the recording of this album and there were a number of prominent guest musicians on the record, including Lou Reed and Talking Heads&#x27; front man David Byrne on a cover of Reed&#x27;s &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;. The fourth member of Talking Heads, Jerry Harrison, also featured on some tracks. As with &quot;Close to the Bone&quot;, the album was not a commercial success although &quot;Suboceana&quot; received some radio play, mainly in the UK, and the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No&quot; made the UK Singles Chart (Tom Tom Club&#x27;s fifth, and to date final, single to do so). The album was the first Tom Tom Club album to be issued on CD and the Japanese CD version featured an added bonus track, the B-side &quot;Devil, Does Your Dog Bite?&quot;, which was also featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;. &quot;Suboceana&quot; and &quot; Don&#x27;t Say No&quot; were also remixed for dance clubs in Deep House and Acid House styles respectively by house music pioneer Marshall Jefferson in 1988.

The following year, in a bid to recapture the attention of the US market, the group and Sire Records decided to issue a radically altered version of the album in the United States. The US version of &quot;Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom&quot; replaced four songs with four others, one of which, &quot;I Confess&quot;, was a total overhaul of the original album&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Teardrop&quot;. The running order of the rest of the album was shuffled while the artwork was revamped. However, the changes had little effect on the album&#x27;s US commercial success.

In 1991, Frantz and Weymouth built the Clubhouse, a painting and music studio, over their garage near Gamecock Island, Connecticut. In 1992, they released the fourth Tom Tom Club album, &quot;Dark Sneak Love Action&quot;, which included a cover of Hot Chocolate&#x27;s &quot;You Sexy Thing&quot;. The album focused on the burgeoning techno music scene. A single, &quot;Sunshine and Ecstasy&quot;, featured remixes by Roger Sanchez.

===&quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Funky&quot; and present activities===
The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Funky&quot;, was released in 2000 and featured cover versions of Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot; and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry&#x27;s &quot;Soul Fire&quot;. One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Who Feelin&#x27; It&quot;, was also featured in remixed form in the soundtrack album of the 2000 film &quot;American Psycho&quot;. Among the musicians on &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Funky&quot; are Jamaican singer Mystic Bowie, Charles Pettigrew and Toots Hibbert of Toots and the Maytals. The album&#x27;s release was followed by one European and several American tours. Tom Tom Club also recorded a cover of Phish&#x27;s &quot;Sand&quot; for a benefit CD, helping them bring in a new, jamband audience.

In 2002, Frantz and Weymouth, along with their former Talking Heads bandmates, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A complete live concert was released in 2003 on the double CD &quot;Live @ the Clubhouse&quot;, recorded at Tom Tom Club&#x27;s regular hide-out studio, the Clubhouse in Connecticut, in front of an audience of fifty guests. Since then, Tom Tom Club has done incidental live shows.

In 2007, the band released a special Christmas single called &quot;Mistletunes&quot;, containing two specially recorded Christmas songs: &quot;Il est nÃ©&quot; and &quot;Christmas in the Club&quot;, which featured Mystic Bowie and scratcher/turntableist Kid Ginseng (Weymouth and Frantz&#x27;s son, Robin). The single was released by Dutch indie label La La Land Records, which was founded by the former Tom Tom Club merchandise crew. In 2009, a deluxe expanded edition of the band&#x27;s first album was released, with &quot;Close to the Bone&quot; added on disc 2. That marked the first time the latter was ever released on CD in its entirety. On September 28, 2010, the band released &quot;Genius of Live&quot; on Nacional Records. The album featured tracks from the album &quot;Live @ the Clubhouse&quot; as well as remix tributes of &quot;Genius of Love&quot; by such artists as Ozomatli, Nortec Collective, Kinky, Mexican Institute of Sound, Money Mark and The Pinker Tones.

Their first studio material in twelve years, &quot;Downtown Rockers&quot;, was released in 2012 on Nacional Records and featured guitarist Pablo Martin and keyboard player Bruce Martin.

<doc id="576430" wikidata="Q541177" url="?curid=576430" title="Horace Hood">
<text>Rear Admiral Sir Horace Lambert Alexander Hood (2 October 1870 â 31 May 1916) was a Royal Navy admiral of the First World War, whose lengthy and distinguished service saw him engaged in operations around the world, frequently participating in land campaigns as part of a shore brigade. His early death at the Battle of Jutland in the destruction of his flagship was met with mourning and accolades from across Britain.

Hood was a youthful, vigorous and active officer whose service in Africa won him the Distinguished Service Order and who was posthumously appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in recognition of his courageous and ultimately fatal service in the Battle of Jutland, during which his ship was constantly engaged from its arrival at the action and caused fatal damage to a German light cruiser. He has been described as &quot;the beau ideal of a naval officer, spirited in manner, lively of mind, enterprising, courageous, handsome, and youthful in appearance â¦ His lineage was pure Royal Navy, at its most gallant&quot;.

==Early career==
Horace Hood was descended from one of the most influential and experienced navy lines, being a great-great-grandson of Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood, who won numerous actions against the French in the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars. His father was Francis Wheler Hood, 4th Viscount Hood, and his mother Edith Lydia Drummond Ward. Born in South Street, London, Hood joined the Royal Navy aged 12, attending cadet training ship at Dartmouth in 1882. Graduating top of his class in September 1885, Hood joined as a midshipman and served on her for a year in the Mediterranean Squadron before joining . In 1887 he was attached to , a small cruiser which sailed for the Pacific Ocean. It was aboard her that Hood experienced the Samoan Hurricane in which &quot;Calliope&quot; was the only survivor of seven foreign warships in Apia Harbour.

===African service===
Hood gained a record score in his exam for lieutenant, and qualified first time. He served in for a time before taking three years out to study gunnery and staff duties. On his return to sea, he spent brief periods aboard , , and . He performed well at these duties and, in 1897, was recommended to the Egyptian government, which provided him with a Nile gunboat to command on the Nile Expedition of 1898 in the Mahdist War. During these operations, Hood was conspicuous in his duty as second-in-command to Captain David Beatty and saw action for the first time, providing artillery support at the Battle of Atbara and Battle of Omdurman. For his services in these operations, he was promoted to commander, skipping the intermediate rank.

During the Second Boer War, Hood was given command of transport ships taking supplies to South Africa. He was later transferred to Admiral Lord Charles Beresford&#x27;s flagship in the Mediterranean from 9 September 1901. Promoted to captain on 1 January 1903, ha was in July that year placed in command of , flagship of Admiral George Atkinson-Willes on the East Indies Station. In April 1904, Hood was given his first independent command as he led a force of 754 sailors, marines and soldiers of the Hampshire Regiment against the Ilig Dervishes of Somaliland. Landing his men on an opposed beach in the dark, Hood led from the front, personally engaging in hand-to-hand combat and driving the dervishes into the hinterland, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

Distinguished by his action, Hood was given command of the armoured cruiser in 1906 and the following year was made naval attachÃ© to the British Embassy in Washington D.C. It was there he met Ellen Touzalin Nickerson, a widowed mother, whom he married in 1910. The couple had two sons, Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood (1910â1981) and Alexander Lambert Hood, 7th Viscount Hood (1914â1999). In 1908, Hood was given command of the pre-dreadnought battleship , in which he served for a year before receiving a shore appointment to command the Royal Naval College, Osborne, where he stayed until 1913 when he was raised to flag rank. For three months Hood raised his flag in the dreadnought battleship before becoming Naval Secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in July 1914.

==First World War==

At the outbreak of the First World War, Hood&#x27;s experience with coastal operations recommended him to serve with a small flotilla of s on the Belgian coast, bombarding German positions and troop formations during the Siege of Antwerp and then the Battle of the Yser, assisting Belgian forces to hold the coastline during the Race for the Sea.

Later in the year, Hood became Commander-in-Chief, Dover and commander of the Dover Patrol, tasked with preventing German ships and submarines passing through. He was transferred to command of Force E at Queenstown by orders of Churchill and Fisher, for his perceived failure to do this as submarines continued to pass the Channel to threaten shipping in the Irish Sea. Force E consisted of obsolete cruisers and boarding vessels whose task was to patrol the area south west of Ireland to give instructions to arriving merchant vessels and guard against attacks by armed merchantmen. In February their operating area had been moved 200 miles further west as they were considered in themselves to be tempting targets for submarines. After his transfer, intelligence reports based on intercepted messages from German submarines showed that they had indeed had extreme difficulty passing the Channel, and as a result their orders were changed to travel around Scotland instead. Before Churchill was replaced as First Lord he corrected his mistake by appointing Hood to command of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron operating out of Rosyth in Scotland. Hood&#x27;s command was the three battlecruisers of the : , and his flagship .

In late May 1916 came the only opportunity for the British battlefleet to engage the German main force at the Battle of Jutland. Hood&#x27;s squadron was attached to Jellicoe&#x27;s main battlefleet and thus had not witnessed the destruction of two British battlecruisers at the guns of their German counterparts. Arriving as the action was well underway but ahead of the main fleet by advantage of their greater speed, Hood&#x27;s force&#x27;s first action was to rescue the light cruiser , which had been separated from the main fleet to provide a signal relay but was then ambushed by four German cruisers and was in danger of sinking. Hood&#x27;s timely arrival scattered the German ships and caused fatal damage to , which sank later that night with 589 of her crew.

Hood&#x27;s intervention had far greater effects than were realised at the time however. In diverting his squadron to the North-West to aid &quot;Chester&quot;, Hood had inadvertently confused the German battlecruiser commander Admiral Hipper into believing that the main British force was approaching from the North-West and prompting his withdrawal to the main German fleet, an act which has been claimed saved the British battlecruiser fleet from destruction. Hood meanwhile attached his squadron to the British battlecruiser squadron of Admiral Beatty and with them formed the vanguard of the British battlefleet, which was now heading directly for the approaching Germans.

===Destruction of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;===

The vanguards of the battlefleets, made up of battlecruisers and smaller ships, collided just before 18.00. The German fleet, possessing better gunnery and range-finding equipment, had the better of the early exchanges; , an old armoured cruiser which was the flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Arbuthnot, was blown up with all 903 hands, and the fast battleship was badly damaged and forced to limp back to Britain. Hood&#x27;s squadron was heavily engaged, &quot;Invincible&quot; facing the combined batteries of and and inflicting damage on &quot;LÃ¼tzow&quot;, which would force her abandonment and scuttling during the night. At this, Hood called through the voicepipe to the gunnery officer, &quot;Keep firing as quickly as possible. You are doing splendidly; every shot is telling.&quot; The combination of the two ships proved too much for Hood&#x27;s flagship, however, and a shell from &quot;Derfflinger&quot; penetrated the &quot;Q&quot; turret of &quot;Invincible&quot;, the same mortal wound which had destroyed a few hours before and almost claimed .

The unstable cordite ammunition carried by &quot;Invincible&quot;, coupled with the weakness of her turret design and armour, resulted in a catastrophic explosion from &quot;Q&quot; turret&#x27;s magazine, which blew the ship in half. The ship&#x27;s remains sank rapidly, settling on the shallow bottom while the bow and stern protruded from the sea. Of &quot;Invincible&quot;â³s crew of 1,021, there were just six survivors, pulled from the water by attendant destroyers. Hood was not amongst them. The Battle of Jutland was ultimately an expensive stalemate; both sides suffered further losses during the night action but the strategic situation remained unchanged. The Royal Navy had suffered over 6,000 fatal casualties, three times the German losses, but remained in control of the North Sea while the High Seas Fleet was forced to retire to harbour.

===Remembrance===
As with his lost shipmates, Hood&#x27;s body was never recovered and remains in the wreckage of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; at the bottom of the North Sea. The wreck is now a protected war grave, although it has suffered from the attentions of looters. Hood&#x27;s name, with all those lost on &quot;Invincible&quot;, is inscribed on the Portsmouth War Memorial administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Admiral Hood was posthumously appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He had previously been made a Member of the Royal Victorian Order. His collected papers were donated by his family, with those of his ancestor Samuel Hood, to the Churchill Archives Centre in 1967. In 1918, Hood&#x27;s widow was asked to launch the ill-fated battlecruiser , named after Horace Hood&#x27;s ancestor, which was lost in the Second World War fighting the . She was sunk with the loss of 1,415 hands when a shell detonated an after magazine. Hood&#x27;s name is inscribed on the War Memorial at St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Barton Seagrave, Northamptonshire.

<text>Walter Abel (June 6, 1898 â March 26, 1987) was an American stage, film, and radio actor whose career spanned nearly seven decades.

==Life==
Abel was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, the son of Christine (nÃ©e Becker) and Richard Michael Abel. Abel graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts where he had studied in 1917 and joined a touring company. His brother Alfred died in 1922 from tuberculosis contracted while serving overseas in World War I. Abel was married to concert harpist Marietta Bitter.

==Career==
Abel made his film debut in 1918 with a small part in &quot;Out of a Clear Sky&quot;, and his Broadway debut in &quot;Forbidden&quot; in 1919.

In 1924, he appeared in two Eugene O&#x27;Neill plays simultaneously: &quot;Bound East for Cardiff&quot; at the Provincetown Playhouse and &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; at the Greenwich Village Theater. His many theatre credits include &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1923), William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;Love for Love&quot; (1925), Anton Chekhov&#x27;s The Seagull (1929â1930), &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1929), Kaufman and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot; (1934), and &quot;Trelawny of the &#x27;Wells&#x27;&quot;. He also appeared in Channing Pollock&#x27;s play &quot;The Enemy&quot; (1926) with Fay Bainter, adapted to film as &quot;The Enemy&quot; (1927) with Lillian Gish and Ralph Forbes. Abel made his stage debut in London in the 1929 &quot;Coquette&quot;.

His first major film role was as D&#x27;Artagnan in RKO Pictures&#x27; 1935 &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, and as hyperactive agent Danny Reed in the 1942 musical comedy &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire.

Abel went on to play in more than sixty films, and was a vice president of the Screen Actors&#x27; Guild.

Abel also appeared as a concert narrator or reader with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot; in 1951, and in Dylan Thomas&#x27; &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; in 1953.

==Death==
Abel died March 26, 1987, of a myocardial infarction at a nursing home in Essex, Connecticut. He was cremated and a memorial service was held at the Little Church Around the Corner in Manhattan. His ashes were combined with those of his wife and scattered in Long Island Sound.

<text>The Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly Learning Resource Centre (or the Djanogly LRC) is a library on the Jubilee Campus of the University of Nottingham, England.

The library houses books and resources relating to courses and research in the university&#x27;s Faculty of Education and School of Computing Science, and also houses the Commonwealth Education Documentation Centre. Since the summer of 2009 the library has also held all adult education course books previously kept at the Shakespeare Street library in Nottingham city centre after it was closed down as part of a money saving plan.

The library is an unusual circular building situated on an island platform in the middle of the campus lake. It was designed by the architect Sir Michael Hopkins, with the striking feature of having only a single floor, which spirals its way up and around the circumference of the building.

The library was named after the philanthropists Sir Harry and Lady Djanogly who gave a significant contribution towards the cost of its construction. Sir Harry Djanogly is the father of Jonathan Djanogly, who became MP for Huntingdon in 2001.
