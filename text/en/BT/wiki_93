<text>A View to a Kill is a 1985 spy film, the fourteenth in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions, and the seventh and final appearance of Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1960 short story &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;, the film has an entirely original screenplay. In &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken), who plans to destroy California&#x27;s Silicon Valley.

The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who also wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum. It was the third James Bond film to be directed by John Glen, and the last to feature Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny.

Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, who frequently took umbrage with the effects of Moore&#x27;s advanced age on his performance, and being disliked by Moore himself, it was a commercial success, with the Duran Duran theme song &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; performing well in the charts, becoming the only Bond theme song to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Song. The film was followed by &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; in 1987.

==Plot==

MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Siberia to locate the body of 003 and recover a Soviet microchip. Q analyzes the microchip, establishing it to be a copy of one designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse, made by government contractor Zorin Industries. Bond visits Ascot Racecourse to observe the company&#x27;s owner, Max Zorin. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes Zorin&#x27;s horses, which win consistently, are drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine, who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the Eiffel Tower, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin&#x27;s bodyguard May Day, who subsequently escapes.

Bond and Tibbett travel to Zorin&#x27;s estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him; he discovers Zorin has written her a cheque for $5 million. That night, Bond and Tibbett infiltrate Zorin&#x27;s laboratory, where he is implanting adrenaline-releasing devices in his horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and attempts to have Bond killed. General Gogol of the KGB confronts Zorin for trying to kill Bond without permission, revealing that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB, but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley, which will give him and the potential investors a monopoly over microchip manufacture.

Bond travels to San Francisco and meets with CIA agent Chuck Lee, who says Zorin is the product of medical experimentation with steroids performed by Dr. Carl Mortner, a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin&#x27;s veterinarian and racehorse-breeding consultant. Bond then investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin, and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording conversations and her partner placing explosives on the rig. Ivanova&#x27;s partner Klottoff is caught and killed, but Ivanova and Bond escape. Later Ivanova takes the recording, but finds that Bond had switched tapes.

Bond tracks down State Geologist Stacey Sutton, the woman Zorin attempted to pay off, and discovers that Zorin is trying to buy her family oil business. The two travel to San Francisco City Hall to check Zorin&#x27;s submitted plans. Having been alerted to their presence, Zorin kills the Chief Geologist, and sets fire to the building to frame Bond for the murder and kill him. Bond and Stacey flee from the police in a fire engine.

Infiltrating Zorin&#x27;s mine, Bond and Stacey discover his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the Hayward and San Andreas faults, which will cause them to flood and submerge Silicon Valley. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a &quot;geological lock&quot; that prevents the two faults from moving simultaneously. Once in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mine and kill the workers. Stacey escapes while Bond fights May Day; after realising Zorin abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb, putting the device onto a handcar and riding it out of the mine, where it explodes and kills her.

Escaping in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, Zorin abducts Stacey while Bond grabs hold of the airship&#x27;s mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock him off, but Bond moors the airship to the framework of the Golden Gate Bridge. Stacey attacks Zorin to save Bond and, in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Stacey flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin follows them out with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death. Mortner attempts to kill Bond with dynamite but Bond cuts the airship free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin, blowing up the airship and killing himself and Scarpine. Later, Gogol awards Bond the Order of Lenin for foiling Zorin&#x27;s scheme.

If she were in the film, this would be her third Bond film appearance.

==Production==
Along with the other stories in Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1960 anthology &quot;For Your Eyes Only,&quot; the original short story &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot; was originally envisioned as an episode of an abandoned 1958 CBS &quot;James Bond&quot; television series&quot;.&quot; &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Wilson also co-authored the screenplay along with Richard Maibaum. Broccoli initially wanted to rehire George MacDonald Fraser from &quot;Octopussy&quot; to co-write the screenplay but he was unavailable. Originally Maibaum&#x27;s script included Zorin manipulating Halley&#x27;s Comet into crashing into Silicon Valley, but Wilson insisted on a more realistic plot. At the end of &quot;Octopussy&quot;, the &quot;James Bond Will Return&quot; sequence listed the next film as &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;, the name of the original short story, but later the title was changed. When a company with a name similar to Zorin (the Zoran Corporation) was discovered in the United States, a disclaimer was added to the start of the film affirming that Zorin was not related to any real-life company. This is the first Bond film to have a disclaimer (&quot;The Living Daylights&quot; had a disclaimer about the use of the Red Cross).

===Casting===
Roger Moore had originally signed a three-film contract with Eon Productions, (&quot;Live and Let Die&quot; in 1973, &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; in 1974 and &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; in 1977) which was fulfilled. Moore&#x27;s following three films (&quot;Moonraker&quot; in 1979, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Octopussy&quot; in 1983) were negotiated on a film-by-film basis. Uncertainty surrounding his involvement in &quot;Octopussy&quot; in 1983 led to other actors being considered to take over but Moore was convinced to come back as he was competing against Sean Connery in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. Eon convinced Moore to do &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; but he announced in December 1985, 6 months after the release of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, that he would retire from the role after seven films.

Early publicity for the film in 1984 included an announcement that David Bowie would play Zorin. He initially accepted the role, but later decided against it, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to spend five months watching my stunt double fall off cliffs.&quot; The role was then offered to Sting, who turned it down, and finally to Christopher Walken.

Priscilla Presley was originally going to be cast as Stacey Sutton, but she had to be replaced by Tanya Roberts because of her contract with &quot;Dallas&quot;. The original script had Barbara Bach reprising her role as Major Anya Amasova from 1977&#x27;s &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. However, Bach declined the role, and so an entirely new character, Pola Ivanova, was created, played by Fiona Fullerton.

Patrick Macnee, as Bond&#x27;s ally Tibbett, became the fourth former star of &quot;The Avengers&quot; television series to appear in a Bond film, following Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and Joanna Lumley. David Yip&#x27;s character Chuck Lee was originally scripted as Felix Leiter, but he was rewritten into a new Asian-American character in order to capitalize on the setting of San Francisco.

Dolph Lundgren has a brief appearance as one of General Gogol&#x27;s KGB agents. Lundgren, who was dating Grace Jones at the time, was visiting her on set when one day an extra was missing, so the director John Glen then asked him if he wanted to attempt the role. Lundgren appears during the confrontation between Gogol and Zorin at the racetrack, standing several steps below Gogol.

===Filming===
Principal photography began with the horse racing scenes at Ascot Racecourse on 1 August 1984. The film was shot at Pinewood Studios in London, Iceland, Switzerland, France and the United States with the budget initially being $35 million. Several French landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, its Jules Verne restaurant and the Château de Chantilly were filmed. The rest of the major filming was done at Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, Dunsmuir House, San Francisco City Hall and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The Lefty O&#x27;Doul Bridge was featured in the fire engine chase scene.

Production of the film began on 23 June 1984 in Iceland, where the second unit filmed the pre-title sequence. On 27 June 1984, several leftover canisters of petrol used during filming of Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Legend&quot; caused Pinewood Studios&#x27; 007 Stage to burn to the ground. The stage was rebuilt, and reopened in January 1985 (renamed as Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s 007 Stage) for filming of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. Work had continued on other stages at Pinewood when Roger Moore rejoined the main unit there on 1 August 1984. The crew then departed for shooting the horse-racing scenes at Royal Ascot Racecourse. The scene in which Bond and Sutton enter the mineshaft was then filmed in a waterlogged quarry near Staines-upon-Thames and the Amberley Chalk Pits Museum in West Sussex.
On 6 October 1984, the fourth unit, headed by special effects supervisor John Richardson, began its work on the climactic fight sequence. At first, only a few plates constructed to resemble the Golden Gate Bridge were used. Later that night, shooting of the burning San Francisco City Hall commenced. The first actual scenes atop the bridge were filmed on 7 October 1984.

In Paris it was planned that two stunt parachutists, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would undertake two jumps from a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a top edge of the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage was obtained from Worth&#x27;s jump, so Caldvedt was told he would not be performing his own descent. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.

Airship Industries managed a major marketing coup with the inclusion of its Skyship 500 series blimp in the film. At the time Airship Industries was producing a fleet of blimps which were recognisable over many capitals of the world offering tours, or advertising sponsorship deals. As all Bond films have included the most current technology, this included the lighter than air interest. The blimp seen in the climax was then on a promotional tour of Los Angeles after its participation in the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics. At that time, it had &quot;Welcome&quot; painted across the side of the gasbag, but was replaced by &quot;Zorin Industries&quot; for the film. During the summer of 1984, the blimp was used to advertise Fujifilm. In real life, inflating the airship would take up to 24 hours, but during the film it was shown to take two minutes.
Despite filming going over schedule by two weeks, the production was completed $5 million under budget at $30 million according to John Glen. Filming completed on 16 January 1985.

==Music==

The soundtrack was composed by John Barry and published by EMI/Capitol. The theme song, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, was written by Barry and Duran Duran, and performed by the band. &quot;May Day Jumps&quot; is the only track that uses the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot;. Barry&#x27;s composition from &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; was modified for use in the songs &quot;Snow Job&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s Dangerous&quot; and &quot;Golden Gate Fight&quot; of &quot;A View to a Kill.&quot; &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, thus becoming the peak song in the James Bond series. The 2015 track &quot;Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; later out performed the song in the UK by reaching number one.

Duran Duran was chosen to do the song after bassist John Taylor, a lifelong Bond fan, approached producer Albert Broccoli at a party, and somewhat drunkenly asked &quot;When are you going to get someone &quot;decent&quot; to do one of your theme songs?&quot;

During the opening sequence, a cover version of the 1965 Beach Boys song &quot;California Girls&quot;, performed by tribute band Gidea Park with Adrian Baker, is used during a chase in which Bond snowboards; it has been suggested that this sequence helped initiate interest in snowboarding.

==Release and reception==
This was the first Bond film with a premiere outside the UK, opening on 22 May 1985 at San Francisco&#x27;s Palace of Fine Arts. The British premiere was held on 12 June 1985 at the Odeon Leicester Square cinema in London. It achieved a box office gross of US$152.4 million worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the film grossed £8.1 million ($13.6 million). On its opening weekend in the US and Canada it grossed $13.3 million from 1,583 theaters over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, the biggest opening for a Bond film ever at the time, but not enough to beat &quot;&quot; which was number one for the weekend with a gross of $25.2 million from 2,074 theaters. It went on to gross $50.3 million in the United States and Canada. Other large international grosses include $11.7 million in Germany, $9.1 million in Japan and $8.2 million in France.

Although its box office reception was excellent, the film&#x27;s critical response was mostly mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 36% based on reviews from 61 critics, which is the lowest rating for the Eon-produced Bond films on the website. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Absurd even by Bond standards, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; is weighted down by campy jokes and a noticeable lack of energy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40% based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

One of the most common criticisms was that Roger Moore was 57 at the time of filming—and that he had visibly aged in the two years that had passed since &quot;Octopussy&quot;. &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Paul Attanasio said, &quot;Moore isn&#x27;t just long in the tooth—he&#x27;s got tusks, and what looks like an eye job has given him the pie-eyed blankness of a zombie. He&#x27;s not believable anymore in the action sequences, even less so in the romantic scenes—it&#x27;s like watching women fall all over Gabby Hayes.&quot; Sean Connery declared that &quot;Bond should be played by an actor 35, 33 years old. I&#x27;m too old. Roger&#x27;s too old, too!&quot; In a December 2007 interview, Roger Moore remarked, &quot;I was only about four hundred years too old for the part.&quot;

Moore also said that, at the time, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; was his least favourite Bond film, and mentioned that he was mortified to find out that he was older than his female co-star&#x27;s mother. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I was horrified on the last Bond I did. Whole slews of sequences where Christopher Walken was machine-gunning hundreds of people. I said &#x27;That wasn&#x27;t Bond, those weren&#x27;t Bond films.&#x27; It stopped being what they were all about. You didn&#x27;t dwell on the blood and the brains spewing all over the place&quot;.

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; said, &quot;The James Bond series has had its bummers, but nothing before in the class of &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. You go to a Bond picture expecting some style or, at least, some flash, some lift; you don&#x27;t expect the dumb police-car crashes you get here. You do see some ingenious daredevil feats, but they&#x27;re crowded together and, the way they&#x27;re set up, they don&#x27;t give you the irresponsible, giddy tingle you&#x27;re hoping for.&quot; Kael also singled out the dispirited direction and the hopeless script. &quot;Director John Glen stages the slaughter scenes so apathetically that the picture itself seems dissociated. (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen another movie in which race horses were mistreated and the director failed to work up any indignation. If Glen has any emotions about what he puts on the screen, he keeps them to himself.)&quot;

However, not all reviews were negative. Lawrence O&#x27;Toole of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; believed it was one of the series&#x27; best entries. &quot;Of all the modern formulas in the movie industry, the James Bond series is among the most pleasurable and durable. Lavish with their budgets, the producers also bring a great deal of craft, wit and a sense of fun to the films. Agent 007 is like an old friend who an audience meets for drinks every two years or so; he regales them with tall tales, winking all the time. The 14th and newest Bond epic, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, is an especially satisfying encounter. Opening with a breathtaking ski chase in Siberia, &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; is the fastest Bond picture yet. Its pace has the precision of a Swiss watch and the momentum of a greyhound on the track. There is a spectacular chase up and down the Eiffel Tower and through Paris streets, which Bond finishes in a severed car on just two wheels. But none of the action prepares the viewer for the heart-stopping climax with Zorin&#x27;s dirigible tangled in the cables on top of San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Bridge.&quot; And although O&#x27;Toole believed that Moore was showing his age in the role, &quot;there are plenty of tunes left in his violin. James Bond is still a virtuoso, with a licence to thrill.&quot;

Brian J. Arthurs of &quot;The Beach Reporter&quot;, however, said it was the worst film of the Bond series. Chris Peachment of the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; said, &quot;Grace Jones is badly wasted.&quot; Norman Wilner of MSN also chose it as the worst Bond film, while IGN picked it as the fourth-worst, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it as the fifth-worst.

Danny Peary had mixed feelings about &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; but was generally complimentary: &quot;Despite what reviewers automatically reported, [Moore] looks trimmer and more energetic than in some of the previous efforts ... I wish Bond had a few more of his famous gadgets on hand, but his action scenes are exciting and some of the stunt work is spectacular. Walken&#x27;s the first Bond villain who is not so much an evil person as a crazed neurotic. I find him more memorable than some of the more recent Bond foes ... Unfortunately, the filmmakers – who ruined villain Jaws by making him a nice guy in &quot;Moonraker&quot; – make the mistake of switching May Day at the end from Bond&#x27;s nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the two (I suppose gentleman Bond isn&#x27;t allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day) ... [The film] lacks the flamboyance of earlier Bond films, and has a terrible slapstick chase sequence in San Francisco, but overall it&#x27;s fast-paced, fairly enjoyable, and a worthy entry in the series.&quot;

Also among the more positive reviews was &quot;Movie Freaks 365&quot;″s Kyle Bell: &quot;Good ol&#x27; Roger gave it his best. ... Whether you can get past the absurdity of the storyline, you can&#x27;t really deny that it has stunning stunt work and lots of action. It&#x27;s an entertaining movie that could have been better.&quot; Walken was also praised by online critic Christopher Null for portraying a &quot;classic Bond villain&quot;. Bond historian John Brosnan believed &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; was Moore&#x27;s best Bond entry. He said Moore looked in better shape than the previous Bond film, &quot;Octopussy&quot;. Brosnan, an airship enthusiast, especially admired the dirigible finale.

Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;When Grace Jones went to bed with Moore, I was sure the producers had hit upon a way to kill the old fellow off with dignity, but when Bond was seen wandering around fresh as a daisy the next morning I realised how escapist this all is. Unless he just rolled over and went to sleep, of course, which is what I was strongly tempted to do.&quot;

Roberts was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Actress, but she lost the trophy to Linda Blair, who appeared in &quot;Night Patrol&quot;, &quot;Savage Island&quot; and &quot;Savage Streets&quot;.

==Other media==
This film was adapted into two video games in 1985. The first, titled &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, was published by Domark. It was available for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Oric 1 and Oric Atmos, and MSX. The second, titled &quot;James Bond 007: A View to a Kill&quot; was a text adventure for the Apple II and IBM PC compatibles. It was developed by Angelsoft and published by Mindscape.

The film was loosely adapted into a series of four &quot;Find Your Fate&quot; adventure game books: &quot;Win, Place, or Die&quot;; &quot;Strike it Deadly&quot;; &quot;Programmed for Danger&quot;; and &quot;Barracuda Run&quot;, which were released in 1985.

Furthermore, a tabletop role-playing game adventure for the &quot;James Bond 007&quot; game system was released under the film&#x27;s name.

May Day was a playable multiplayer character in the 1997 and 2000 video games &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;007: The World Is Not Enough&quot; for the Nintendo 64. In the 2002 game &quot;Nightfire&quot;, May Day and Max Zorin also appears as bots. Other references include Nikolai Diavolo, a character in the 2004 game &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;, claiming Zorin to be his mentor and friend. In &quot;&quot;, a multiplayer level is the summit of the Golden Gate Bridge, including the Zorin blimp, which would fire on players when activated. Players are also able to climb the suspension cables (similar to the events of the film).

<text>Maturidism () is a school of theology in Sunni Islam named after Abu Mansur al-Maturidi. It is one of the three creeds of Sunni Islam alongside Ash&#x27;arism and Atharism, and prevails in the Hanafi school of jurisprudence.

Al-Maturidi codified and systematized the theological Islamic beliefs already present among the Ḥanafite Muslim theologians of Balkh and Transoxiana under one school of systematic theology (&quot;kalām&quot;); Abu Hanifa emphasized the use of rationality and theological rationalism regarding the interpretation of the sacred scriptures of Islam. 

Maturidism was originally circumscribed to the region of Transoxiana in Central Asia but it became the predominant theological orientation amongst the Sunnī Muslims of Persia before the Safavid conversion to Shīʿīsm in the 16th century, and the (people of reason). It enjoyed a preeminent status in the Ottoman Empire and Mughal India. Outside the old Ottoman and Mughal empires, most Turkic tribes, Hui people, Central Asian, and South Asian Muslims also follow the Maturidi theology. There have also been Arab Maturidi scholars.

== History ==
The history of the Maturidi School is characterized by three phases. The phase lasted until the end of the 10th century, and is characterized by the fact that nothing of importance happened for the development of the school. Al-Maturidi had many followers; of them the most important is Abū Salama al-Samarqandī, who gave us the summary of Al- Maturidi&#x27;s Kitab Al Tawhid namely the Jumal usul al-dīn.

==Beliefs and creed==

Al-Maturidi, being a follower of the Hanafi school of Islamic jurisprudence, based his theological opinions and epistemological perspectives on the teachings of the school&#x27;s eponymous founder, Abu Hanifa (8th century CE).

The Maturidi school of Islamic theology holds that:
* All the attributes of God are eternal, distinct, and also inseparable from God.
* Ethics have an objective existence and humans are capable of recognizing it through reason alone.
* Although humans are intellectually capable of realizing God, they need revelations and guidance of prophets and messengers, because human desire can divert the intellect and because certain knowledge of God has been specially given to these prophets (e.g. the Quran was revealed to Muhammad according to Islam, who Muslims believe was given this special knowledge from God and only through Muhammad did this knowledge become accessible to others).
* Humans are free in determining their actions within scope of God-given possibilities. Accordingly, God has created all possibilities, but humans are free to choose.
* The Six articles of faith.
* Religious authorities need reasonable arguments to prove their claims.
* Support of science and &quot;falsafa&quot; (philosophy).
* The Maturidites state that &quot;imān&quot; (faith) does not increase nor decrease depending on one&#x27;s deeds; it&#x27;s rather &quot;taqwā&quot; (piety) which increases and decreases.
* The Maturidites emphasize the importance of monotheism and the transcendence of God (tanzih).

Regarding &quot;ʿaqīdah&quot; (creed), unlike many Mu&#x27;tazilites (free-will theology), al-Maturidi does not hold that angels are necessarily infallible. Pointing at surah al-Baqara, he notes that angels too, have been tested. Referring to &quot;surah al-Anbiyāʼ&quot;, he points out, angels who claim divinity for themselves are sentenced to hell. About Iblīs, otherwise known as Satan, he states, disputing whether he was an angel or a jinn before his fall is useless, as it is more important to know, that he has become a devil and enemy of humans.

Maturidism holds that humans are creatures endowed with reason, which differentiates them from animals. The relationship between people and God differs from that of nature and God; humans are endowed with free-will, but due to God&#x27;s sovereignty, God creates the acts the humans choose, so humans can perform them. Ethics can be understood just by rational thought and do not require prophetic guidance. Al-Maturidi also considered the aḥādīth to be unreliable when they are at odds with reason. Furthermore, Maturidi theology opposes anthropomorphism and similitude, but simultaneously does not deny the divine attributes.

Maturidism defends the idea that paradise and hell are coexisting with the temporal world, against the assertion of some Muʿtazila that paradise and hell will be created only after the Day of Judgement. The attributes of paradise and hell would already take effect on this world (&quot;dunya&quot;). Abū l-Laiṯ as-Samarqandī (944–983 CE) stated that the purpose of simultaneous existence of both worlds is that they inspire hope and fear among humans.

== Concept of faith ==
Al-Maturidi&#x27;s doctrine, primarily based on Ḥanafī theology and jurisprudence, asserted man&#x27;s capacity and will alongside the supremacy of God in man&#x27;s acts, providing a doctrinal framework for more flexibility and adaptability. Maturidism especially flourished and spread among the Muslim populations in Central Asia from the 10th century onwards.

According to Maturidism, belief (&quot;ʾīmān&quot;) does neither increase nor decrease depending on observation of religious law. Instead, deeds follow from faith. Based on &quot;Surah Ṭā Hā&quot; (verse 112), if a Muslim does not perform the deeds prescribed by the Islamic law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;), he is not considered an apostate as long as he doesn&#x27;t deny his obligations. According to al-Maturidi, faith isn&#x27;t based on actions or confession, but comes from the heart. He supports his doctrine by referring to &quot;Surah al-ʿImrān&quot; (verse 3:22): &quot;They are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and for them there will be no helpers.&quot; These people would have performed the obligatory actions and rituals without the proper faith in their heart. Therefore, actions must be based on faith to be acceptable before God. Maturidism is known for its reserved position regarding &quot;takfir&quot;: Based on Surah 2:30, &quot;Kitāb al-ʿĀlim&quot; states that neither humans nor angels can know what is in the &quot;heart&quot; of a human, thus it couldn&#x27;t be said who is inwardly a Muslim and who is not, except for those who commit acts of disbelief. One who is committing sins isn&#x27;t necessarily a disbeliever, but someone who explicitly dissociates themselves from God is.

Similarly, it is argued that the obedience to God observed by angels and prophets derives from their insights to God&#x27;s nature and doesn&#x27;t result from their creation. Abū al-Qāsim Ishaq ibn Muhammad al Maturidi (9th to 10th centuries CE) drew an analogy on Harut and Marut, who are regarded as sinful yet not unbelievers (&quot;Kuffār&quot;) in the Islamic tradition. Al-Samarqandī further stated that children cannot be considered unbelievers and all of them go to paradise. According to al-Maturidi, human rationality is supposed to acknowledge the existence of a creator deity (&quot;bāriʾ&quot;) solely based on rational thought and independently from divine revelation. He shared this conviction with his teacher and predecessor Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān (8th century CE), whereas the 10th-century Muslim scholar and theologian Abū al-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī never held such a view. Although Māturīdism adhers, like the Mu&#x27;tazilites, to ethical realism, the former holds that moral objects are ultimately created by God, thus God is not bound by them, but human reason can detect such moral truths on their own.

Yohei Matsuyama points to al-Maturidi&#x27;s wording about faith, referring to the only obligation to believe in a creator (&quot;bāriʾ&quot;) or maker (&quot;sanī&quot;), not specifically in Allah, and concludes, it is only necessary for salvation to construct a belief in a creator, not necessarily accepting the theological or doctrinal formulations of Islam. Toshihiko Izutsu likewise argues that &quot;believing in islam&quot; refers to submission to the creator, by voluntarily surrendering to his will, and not necessarily accepting a religious formula.

Yet, al-Maturidi did not view all religions as equal. He criticized Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, and atheists or materialists (&quot;Dahrīya&quot;). However, he drew a distinction between other Abrahamic monotheistic religions and non-Abrahamic non-monotheistic religions, criticizing Judaism and Christianity on the matter of prophecy and individual prophets, not about God. Dualistic religions faced criticism by al-Maturidi regarding their conception of God, arguing that an omnibenevolent deity, who creates only good, opposed to a devil, who is responsible for everything evil, implies a deficit in God&#x27;s omnipotence and is incompatible with God&#x27;s nature.

== Geographical spread ==
Particularly and inextricably, Maturidism is closely linked to the Hanafi school of law. Therefore, where there are Hanafis, there are Maturidis. Maturidism was initially spread in the Eastern realms of the Islamic world, particularly in Samarqand and Transoxiana. It became widespread among Turkic peoples in Central Asia and was introduced into the Middle East with the coming of the Seljuks. It was popular among the Arabicized Persians of eastern Khurasan and was the preferred school of the Central Asian and Ottoman Turks. From its central Asian origins, it spread all over the lands of Islam, from Egypt in the west to China and India in the east. In this capacity, at least during the High Middle Ages. Wilferd Madelung explains the connection between the earlier Seljuk Turks, Hanafi law, and Maturidi theology: Currently, Maturidis are widespread in Afghanistan, Central Asia, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Balkans (especially Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo and Skopje), northwestern China, the Levant (especially Syria, Lebanon and Palestine), the Caucasus, Tatarstan, and Bashkortostan.

<doc id="583941" wikidata="Q627267" url="?curid=583941" title="Mwambutsa IV of Burundi">
<text>Mwambutsa IV Bangiricenge (6 May 1912 – 26 March 1977) was the penultimate king (&quot;mwami&quot;) of Burundi who ruled between 1915 and 1966. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his father Mutaga IV Mbikije (reigned 1908–15). Born while Burundi was under German colonial rule, Mwambutsa&#x27;s reign mostly coincided with Belgian colonial rule (1916–62). The Belgians retained the monarchs of both Rwanda and Burundi under the policy of indirect rule.

==Early life and regency==
Mwambutsa IV was born Prince Bangiricenge in at Nyabiyogi, chiefdom of Buyenzi, Ruanda-Urundi. He was one of two sons of Mwami (king) Mutaga IV and Ngenzahayo. Like other Burundian kings, he was an ethnic Ganwa. He became king, taking the regnal name Mwambutsa, on 16 December 1915 when he was still a child following the death of his father in a family dispute. Because of his age, a regency was declared. Several family members, including Queen Mother Ririkumutima, served as regent. At the time of his coronation, Burundi was part of German East Africa but was captured by Belgium in 1916 during the East African campaign in World War I. In 1925, a full regency council was established with Belgian approval.

Mwambutsa underwent a traditional Burundian education until he was about the age of 13. In 1925 the Belgians opened a primary school in Muramvya so he could attend it. Two years later a Roman Catholic mission was established in Bukeye with the goal of further educating the prince and one day converting him to Catholicism. Mwambutsa&#x27;s performance in school was undistinguished and he never converted.

== Colonial reign ==
Mwambutsa became a ruler in his own right on 28 August 1929, when the regency council declared he was of-age for the throne. On 24 December 1930 he married Thérèse Kanyonga, a Tutsi of the Abasine clan. He married her because she was Catholic.

Mwambutsa actively distanced himself from partisan politics, saying on 8 February 1960, &quot;I do not belong to any political party...I do not authorize anyone and no party to claim exclusivity of my patronage or to discredit, in my name, any other party having as its goal the interest of the Barundi.&quot; In June 1962, shortly before Urundi&#x27;s independence, he went on a tour of villages throughout the country to present a speech appealing to residents to commit to hard work and to respect law and order.

==Post-independence rule and exile==
Urundi became independent as the Kingdom of Burundi on 1 July 1962. Mwambutsa attended ceremonies in Bujumbura to mark the occasion, reviewing troops of the Burundian National Army (&quot;Armée Nationale Burundaise&quot;). He delivered a speech in which he asked Burundians and foreign technicians to &quot;work together in a common effort to make this Burundi a peaceful, hard-working, prosperous, and perfectly happy country.&quot;

On 15 December Mwambutsa was made a member of the Order of Pope Pius IX. He met with Pope John XXIII at Vatican City the following day.

On the independence of Burundi, Mwambutsa IV became the head of state of Burundi with far reaching political power. In Rwanda, the monarchy had been overthrown between 1959–62. He attempted to balance ethnic tensions between ethnic Hutu and Tutsi subjects by choosing his prime ministers from each ethnic group alternately. In October 1965, Hutu officers attempted a coup against the monarchy. Despite their failure to take power, Mwambutsa fled into exile in the Republic of the Congo, eventually moving to Switzerland. In March 1966 he designated his only surviving son Charles Ndizeye to exercise his powers in the country. Still in exile, Mwambutsa was officially deposed in a second coup that brought his son to power as Ntare V on 8 July 1966. The monarchy was finally abolished altogether in a third coup in November 1966 and its leader, Michel Micombero, came to power as president and dictator. Mwambutsa spent the rest of his life in Switzerland where he died in 1977.

==Exhumation==
Mwambutsa&#x27;s remains were exhumed from their burial site in Switzerland in 2012 with a view to repatriating them to Burundi for a state funeral. After a legal battle, however, the remains were re-interred in Switzerland in 2016 in accordance with his family&#x27;s wishes.

<text>Imam Abu Mansur Muhammad bin Muhammad (; 853–944) was a Hanafi jurist and theologian who is the eponym of the Maturidi school of kalam in Sunnism. He got his from Māturīd, a district in Samarkand. His works include , a classic exegesis of the Qur&#x27;an, and . 

His doctrinal school remains amongst the three main schools of theology alongside Ash&#x27;arism and Atharism.

==Name==
Abū Manṣūr al-Māturīdī&#x27;s epithet or &quot;nisba&quot; refers to Māturīd or Māturīt, a locality in Samarkand (today Uzbekistan). His full name was Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad ibn Maḥmūd and he adopted the al-Māturīdī and al-Ḥanafī. he is also known by the titles Shaykh al-Islam (&#x27;Shaykh of Islam&#x27;), Imam al-Huda (&#x27;Imam of Guidance&#x27;), and Imam Ahl al-Sunna wa-l-Jama&#x27;a (&#x27;Imam of the People of the Prophetic Way and Community&#x27;).

== Teachers ==
He studied under his teachers, Muhammad bin Muqatil al-Razi (d. 248 H/ 662 CE), Abu Nasr al-Ayadi &quot;al-Faqih al-Samarqandi&quot; (d. 260 H?), Nusayr bin Yahya al-Balkhi (d. 268 H/ 881 CE), and Abu Bakr al-Juzjani (d. 250 H?). He narrated all of Abu Hanifa&#x27;s books such as Kitab al-Alim wa Mut&#x27;alim and Al-Wasiyya from his teachers in authentic chains which Al-Bazdawi mentions in his book Usul Al-Deen. 

His chains to Abu Hanifa are given as follows:
#He took from Muhammad bin Muqatil al-Razi (d. 248 H), from Muhammad al-Shaybani (d. 189 H), from Abu Hanifa (d. 150 H).
#He took from Abu Nasr al-Ayadi (d. 260 H?), Nusayr al-Balkhi (d. 268 H) and Abu Bakr al-Juzjani (d. 250 H?), who all took from Abu Sulayman al-Juzjani (d. 200 H?), who took from both Muhammad al-Shaybani and Abu Yusuf (d. 182 H), who both took from Abu Hanifa.
#He took from Muhammad bin Muqatil al-Razi and Nusayr al-Balkhi, who additionally both took from Abu Muti al-Hakam al-Balkhi (d. 199 H) and Abu Muqatil Hafs al-Samarqandi (d. 208 H), who both took from Abu Hanifa.
#He took from Abu Nasr al-Ayadi, who took from Abu Ahmad bin Ishaq al-Juzjani (died mid- third century), who took directly from Muhammad al-Shaybani, who took from Abu Hanifa.

== Students ==
Among his students: Ali bin Said Abu al-Hasan al-Rustughfani, Abu Muhammad Abdal-Karim bin Musa bin Isa al-Bazdawi, and Abu al-Qasim al-Hakim al-Samarqandi.

==Life==
Al‑Maturidi was born at Maturid, a village or quarter in the neighbourhood of Samarkand. According to one biography he is known for being a descendant of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Relatively little is known about the life of Maturidi, as the sources available &quot;do not read as biographies, but rather as lists of works that have been enlarged upon by brief statements on his personage and a few words of praise.&quot; What is evident, however, is that the theologian lived the life of a pure scholar, as &quot;nothing indicates that he held any public office, nor that he possessed more disciples, popularity, or association with the Sāmānid court of Bukhārā than anyone else.&quot; It is accepted, moreover, that Maturidi had two principal teachers, namely Abū Bakr al-Jūzjānī and Abū Naṣr Aḥmad b. al-ʿAbbās al-ʿIyāḍī (d. ca. 874–892), both of whom played significant roles in the shaping of Maturidi&#x27;s theological views. Maturidi is said to have lived the life of an ascetic (&quot;zāhid&quot;), and various sources attribute numerous miracles (&quot;karāmāt&quot;) to him. Although he is not usually considered a mystic, it is nevertheless very possible that Maturidi had some interaction with the Sufis of his area, as &quot;Hanafite theology in the region could not always be sharply separated from mystical tendencies,&quot; and many of the most important Hanafi jurists of the area were also Sufi mystics.

==Theology==

Maturidi defined faith (&quot;īmān&quot;) as &quot;taṣdīḳ bi ’l-ḳalb&quot; or &quot;inner assent, expressed by verbal confession (&quot;ịḳrār bi ’l-lisān&quot;).&quot; According to Maturidi, moreover, Islamic actions (practices or worship) (&quot;aʿmāl&quot;) are not a part of faith. Additionally, Maturidi held that &quot;faith cannot decrease nor increase in substance, though it may be said to increase through renewal and repetition.&quot;

Maturidi supported using allegorical interpretation with respect to the anthropomorphic expressions in the Quran, though he rejected many of the interpretations the Mutazilites would reach using this method. In other instances, Maturidi espoused using the traditionalist &quot;bilā kayf&quot; method of reading scripture, which insisted on &quot;unquestioning acceptance of the revealed text.&quot; Maturidi further refuted the Mutazilites in his defense of the Attributes of God &quot;as real and eternally subsisting&quot; in the Essence of God (&quot;ḳāʾima bi ’l-d̲h̲āt&quot;). His chief theological divergence from Ashʿarī was that he held the attributes of essence and action to be &quot;equally eternal and subsistent in the Divine Essence.&quot; Thus, &quot;he insisted that the expressions &#x27;God is eternally the Creator&#x27; and &#x27;God has been creating from eternity (&quot;lam yazal k̲h̲āliḳan&quot;)&#x27; are equally valid, even though the created world is temporal.&quot; Furthermore, Maturidi staunchly defended the notion of non-theophanic vision of God (&quot;ruʾya&quot;) against the Mutazilites, and &quot;consistently rejected the possibility of &quot;idrāk&quot;, which he understood as grasping, of God by the eyes.&quot;

Contrary to popular assumption, Al-Maturidi was not a student of Al-Ash&#x27;ari. The historian al-Bayadi (d. 1078 H) emphasised this saying, &quot;Maturidi is not Ash&#x27;ari&#x27;s follower, as many people would tend to think. He had upheld Sunni Islam long before Ashari, he was a scholar to thoroughly explain and systematically develop Abu Hanifa&#x27;s and his followers&#x27; school&quot;.

==Work==
When Maturidi was growing up there was an emerging reaction against some sects, notably Mu&#x27;tazilis, Qarmati, and Shi&#x27;a. Maturidi, with other two preeminent scholars, wrote especially on the creed of Islam, the other two being Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari in Iraq, and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Tahawi in Egypt.

While Al-Ash&#x27;ari were Sunni together with Maturidi, he constructed his own theology taking from Abu Hanifa&#x27;s school and systematized it which differed from his contemporary imam al Tahawi who affirmed the beliefs of Abu Hanifa. Regardless, both were hanafi in their creed but with different approaches. Gimaret argued that Al-Ash&#x27;ari enunciated that God creates the individual&#x27;s power (qudra), will, and the actual act, which according to Hye, gives way to a fatalist school of theology, which was later put in a consolidated form by Al Ghazali. According to Encyclopædia Britannica however, Al-Ashari held the doctrine of Kasb as an explanation for how free will and predestination can be reconciled. Maturidi, followed in Abu Hanifa&#x27;s footsteps, and presented the &quot;notion that God was the creator of man&#x27;s acts, although man possessed his own capacity and will to act&quot;. Maturidi and Al-Ash&#x27;ari also separated from each other in the issue of the attributes of God, as well as some other minor issues.

Later, with the impact of Turkic society states such as Great Seljuq Empire and Ottoman Empire, Hanafi-Maturidi school spread to greater areas where the Hanafi school of law is prevalent, such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, South Asia, Balkan, Russia, China, Caucasus and Turkey.

Maturidi had immense knowledge of dualist beliefs (Sanawiyya) and of other old Persian religions. His &quot;Kitāb al-Tawḥīd&quot; in this way has become a primary source for modern researchers with its rich materials about Iranian Manicheanism (Mâniyya), a group of Brahmans (Barähima), and some controversial personalities such as Ibn al-Rawandi, Abu Isa al-Warraq, and Muhammad b. Shabib.

==Legacy and veneration==
His school became the dominant Sunni school of Islamic theology in Central Asia, and later enjoyed a preeminent status as the theological school of choice for both the Ottoman Empire and the Mughal Empire.

Al-Maturidi was known as &quot;Shaykh al-Islām&quot; and &quot;Imām al-Hudā&quot; (&quot;Leader of Right Guidance&quot;). He was one of the two foremost Imams of the Sunni Islam in his time, along with Abū al-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī in matters of theological inquiry. In contrast al-Ashʿarī, who was a Shāfiʿī jurist, al-Māturīdī adhered to the eponymous school of jurisprudence founded by Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān, and to his creed (&quot;ʿaqīdah&quot;) as transmitted and elaborated by the Ḥanafī Muslim theologians of Balkh and Transoxania. It was this theological doctrine which al-Māturīdī codified, systematized, and used to refute not only the opinions of the Muʿtazilites, the Karramites, and other heterodox groups, but also non-Islamic theologies such as those of Chalcedonian Christianity, Miaphysitism, Manichaeanism, Marcionism, and Bardaisanism.

Although there was in the medieval period &quot;a tendency to suppress Maturidi&#x27;s name and to put Ashʿarī forward as the champion of Islam against all heretics,&quot; except in Transoxiana, Maturidism gradually &quot;came to be widely recognised as the second orthodox Sunni theological school besides&quot; Ashʿarīsm. It is evident from the surviving fifteenth-century accounts of Maturidi&#x27;s tomb in the cemetery of Jākardīza in Samarkand that the theologian&#x27;s tomb was &quot;visited ... and held in honor for a long time&quot; throughout the medieval period. This veneration of the theologian seems to have arisen out of traditions preserved by several later scholars which detailed Maturidi&#x27;s wisdom and spiritual abilities. For example, Abul Muīn al-Nasafī (d. 1114) stated that Maturidi&#x27;s spiritual gifts were &quot;immeasurably plentiful&quot; and that &quot;God singled him out with miracles (&quot;kāramāt&quot;), gifts of grace (&quot;mawāhib&quot;), divine assistance (&quot;tawfiq&quot;), and guidance (&quot;irshād&quot;, &quot;tashdīd&quot;).&quot;

Contemporary Salafism and Wahhabism, however, tends to be very critical of Maturidi&#x27;s legacy in Sunni Islam due to their aversion towards using any rational thought in matters of theology, which they deem to be heretical, despite this antagonism being a position that conflicts with the consensus of Sunnism throughout history. As such, it is often said that mainstream &quot;orthodox Sunnism&quot; constitutes the followers of the theological traditions of Maturidi and Ashʿarī, while Salafism and Wahhabism have often been interpreted by the proponents of the two major schools to be minority splinter theological traditions opposed to the mainstream. Furthermore, the minor theoretical differences between the theological formulations of Maturidi and Ashʿarī are often deemed by their respective followers to be superficial rather than real, whence &quot;the two schools are equally orthodox&quot; in traditional Sunnism. The traditional Sunni point of view is summarized in the words of the twentieth-century Islamic publisher Munīr ʿAbduh Agha, who stated: &quot;There is not much [doctrinal] difference between the Ashʿarīs and Māturīdīs, hence both groups are now called People of the Sunna and the Community.&quot;

<doc id="583947" wikidata="Q3474201" url="?curid=583947" title="Sac and Fox Nation">
<text>The Sac and Fox Nation (Sauk language: Thâkîwaki) is the largest of three federally recognized tribes of Sauk and Meskwaki (Fox) Indian peoples. They are based in central Oklahoma.

Originally from the Lake Huron and Lake Michigan area, they were forcibly relocated to Oklahoma in the 1870s and are predominantly Sauk. The Sac and Fox Oklahoma Tribal Statistical Area (OTSA) is the land base in Oklahoma governed by the tribe.

The two other Sac and Fox tribes are the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa and the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska. The Sac and Fox tribes have historically been closely allied, and continue to be in the present day. They speak very similar Algonquian languages, which are sometimes considered to be two dialects of the same language, rather than separate languages. 

== Name ==
Their autonym, Thâkîwaki, is also written Thakiwaki, Othâkîwaki, and Sa ki wa ki. It translated as &quot;people coming forth from the water&quot;.

==Government==

The Sac and Fox Nation is headquartered in Stroud, Oklahoma, and their tribal jurisdictional area covers Lincoln, Payne, and Pottawatomie counties. Their Principal Chief is Randall Carter. A council of five elected officials, each elected for a four-year term, govern the tribe. Elections are held in August in odd-numbered years.

Of the 3,794 enrolled tribal citizens in 2011, 2,557 live in Oklahoma. Citizenship in the tribe requires a minimum 1/8 blood quantum, with proven descent to ancestors on recognized rolls.

==Economic development==
The tribe&#x27;s housing authority is located in Shawnee, Oklahoma. They issue their own tribal vehicle tags and operate eleven smoke shops and two casinos, the Black Hawk Casino in Shawnee and the Sac and Fox Nation Casino in Stroud. The Stroud casino features the Center Sky Stage, a live entertainment venue.

==History==
The Sac or Thakiwaki lived near Lake Huron and Lake Michigan at the time of European contact. In 1832 they participated in the Black Hawk War against the United States. Military leader Black Hawk remains a cultural hero today. After the war, the tribe relocated several times from Illinois to Iowa, Kansas, and finally Indian Territory in the 1870s.

Their current lands were part of the larger, historical Sac and Fox Reservation of 1867–1891, which was and established by the United States to provide land to the tribes. But by the late 19th century, U.S. policy changed again. Under the Dawes Act of 1887, these tribal land holdings were divided into 160-acre allotments for individual households, intended to encourage the Native Americans to establish subsistence farming according to the European-American cultural ways. Not only did the act not recognize Native American culture, but in many places in this arid land, the allotments were too small to be farmed successfully. Their land was allotted under a June 12, 1890 agreement with the Cherokee Commission. (Individual commissions were set up to manage the allotment of lands of various tribes in Native American Territory. Land remaining after the allotments was declared &quot;surplus&quot; by the US and sold, primarily to non-Natives. Under the related Curtis Act of 1898, the tribal government and its institutions were dismantled. 

The tribe was previously known as the Sac and Fox Tribe of Indians of the Mississippi River. The Sac and Fox tribe had historically occupied large portions of Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri, which they gradually ceded to the US by treaties forced by European-American encroachment. By an October 11, 1842 treaty they were removed out of the Midwest to a reservation in Kansas. Noted diplomat Jeffrey Deroine, a formerly enslaved man, served as an interpreter for this treaty.

By 1889 519 of the tribe were located in Indian Territory, what is now central Oklahoma. On June 10, 1890, they ceded these Indian Territory lands to the federal government.

===Self-government re-established in 20th century===
The administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt established what was called an &quot;Indian New Deal&quot;, passing a law to encourage tribes to re-establish self-government. The Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1934 was passed by its legislature in a similar effort. In 1937, the Sac and Fox organized Under these laws and gained federal recognition as a tribe, with an independent relationship to the federal government. They have areas of tribal jurisdiction in Oklahoma, while no longer having a reservation.

Under their constitution, they established tribal citizenship as applying to everyone listed on the tribal Dawes Rolls and their descendants, as long as individuals had a minimum blood quantum of one-eighth Sac and Fox blood (equivalent to one great-grandparent). They recognize that descendants may be brought up as culturally Sac and Fox while having mixed ancestry.

===Late 20th century to present===

The tribe has become increasingly active in asserting its sovereignty since the late 20th century. In 1983, the tribal government established its own system for registering vehicles and issuing license plates for tribal citizens. The state of Oklahoma tried to collect registration fees anyway, and the tribe sued. The US Supreme Court ruled in the tribe&#x27;s favor of its independent sovereignty on May 17, 1993, in &quot;Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Sac &amp; Fox Nation.&quot; Other tribes have since established their own systems for vehicle registration on tribal lands. The Sac and Fox Nation celebrate May 17 as &quot;Victory Day.&quot;

Tribal officials have concentrated on the federal management of trust land fees and environmental issues on their land that has been leased for oil production. On May 16, 1989, a tribal representative group that included Elmer Manatowa, Principal Chief; Truman Carter, Treasurer; William Rice, Attorney General; James L. Welsh III, Director of Real Estate; and Curtis Cunard, Petroleum Consultant, testified before the 101st Congress, Special Committee on Investigations of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs, United States Senate. The testimony examined the federal government&#x27;s management of water and natural resources of the Sac and Fox Nation. They testified to the extensive surface damage and permanent contamination of the tribal drinking water, which was destroyed by waterflooding techniques and the injection well process used by the oil companies. These officers also testified to the lack of federal oversight and trust management responsibilities, including fraudulent real estate appraisals of their lands. This historic testimony by the tribe&#x27;s representatives, the result of their internal investigations, revealed the extensive mismanagement of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and its failure in carrying out trust responsibilities. 

This was one of a series of suits by tribes against the government on the financial management of trust land fees. As a result, the BIA has made significant trust management changes. Through the courts, the US and the Sac and Fox Nation came to historic financial settlements in compensation for some of the damage.

<text>JOY 94.9 (official call sign 3JOY), stylised as JOY or JOY 94.9, is a community radio station broadcasting at 94.9 FM in Melbourne. It is Australia&#x27;s first and only LGBTQI+ community radio station.

==History==
JOY 94.9, originally incorporated on 28 June 1993 as &quot;JOY Melbourne Independent Community Broadcasters Association&quot; began its first test transmission on 1 December 1993 (World AIDS Day). Transmission was on 90.7 MHz from 268A Coventry Street, South Melbourne, a total space 80sqm consisting of 1 broadcasting studio, above a hardware store.

The first words spoken on-air were broadcast by accident by founder John Oliver saying &quot;Can I have a cup of coffee and then we’ll get going?&quot; The first track to be played on-air was scheduled to be Kylie Minogue&#x27;s Celebration, but due to technical issues Jimmy Barnes&#x27; Working Class Man was played first. JOY continued to broadcast via temporary test transmissions, mostly on a part-time basis sharing the 90.7 frequency with other community broadcasters. Beginning in 1995, JOY released an annual Electronic and remix compilation album which was a representation of the music broadcast on-air for listeners to purchase and listen to from home. The first compilation album released was called &quot;The Strip – Pride and JOY&quot;.

JOY&#x27;s community involvement and representation has evolved over the years with the first outside live-cross occurring at the 1995 Midsumma Festival. This was cemented further with JOY&#x27;s full outside broadcast in 1996 taking place from the window of &quot;The Outlook&quot; on Commercial Road, Prahran. This resulted in a continuous broadcast for a period of three weeks, 24 hours a day.

JOY Melbourne Independent Community Broadcasters Association changed its name to JOY Melbourne Incorporated in 1996.

In 1998, Paul Terdich was appointed as JOY Station Manager and oversaw the station&#x27;s initial growth and later the station&#x27;s successful application for a full-time licence. JOY initially shared the 90.7 frequency with Muslim radio (and Kool &#x27;n&#x27; Deadly Aboriginal radio) so listeners could wake up one morning with disco divas and the next be called to Islamic prayer. The last test broadcast as an aspirant broadcaster on 90.7 was on 28 August 2001.

Out of the approximately 20 aspirant community radio licensees in Melbourne, JOY Melbourne was one of only four to be granted a full-time broadcasting licence in 2001 (the other broadcasters were SYN FM, Light FM and 3KND). In its application to the Australian broadcasting regulator (Australian Broadcasting Authority) JOY had applied for a community licence in both the Melbourne-Wide and lesser coverage Melbourne City coverage areas. However JOY Melbourne was successful in the Melbourne City licence area where it succeeded against one competing applicant then known as CityFM &quot;(Refer to ACMA licence report for official licence allocations report)&quot;.

JOY Melbourne commenced full-time broadcasting on its permanent licence in January 2002 on its current frequency of 94.9 MHz. The station also increased its broadcasting space to 120sqm to include 2 broadcasting studios. 2002 saw JOY receive a grant from the Foundation for Young Australians to train same-sex attracted youth in radio which saw more than 70 young people pass through the FYA program.

2004 saw JOY Melbourne Inc. become the largest gay and lesbian community member-based organisation in Australia, with the station&#x27;s full time license renewed in 2006.

In 2007 Stephen Hahn was appointed as JOY CEO Station Manager and oversaw the planning to move JOY from the South Melbourne location of 14 years to Bourke Street, Melbourne as part of the City of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;City Village&quot; initiative. In July 2008, after 14 years in South Melbourne, JOY 94.9 relocated to the City Village premises in Bourke Street.

Long-time presenter of Allegro Non Troppo, CBAA and JOY Board Member and JOY Melbourne Inc. Life Member Addam Stobbs died on 16 June 2010.

In June 2011, the JOY 94.9 App was released via the iTunes Store allowing people all around the world to take JOY with them.

In December 2019 it was announced that JOY 94.9 would move from its Melbourne CBD Location to the new Victorian Pride Centre, with the Andrews state government providing $800,000 over four years to assist with the move. It was expected that JOY would begin the relocation in 2021. The relocation was completed in May 2021.

In August 2022, the organisation announced an expansion that would see the station become the radio broadcasting arm of a new entity, JOY Media. The expansion included the addition of JOY Academy, to provide &quot;training and education services to the public in podcasting, radio programming, and diversity and inclusion best practice&quot;.

== Outside Broadcasts &amp; Special Events ==

JOY 94.9 has hosted a range of special event outside broadcast events and general special events since 1996. This has included co-broadcasting from inside the barricades at the 30th Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras in conjunction with Sydney station 2SER.

JOY hosted the first same-sex on-air wedding on 1 November 2019 as part of an on-air competition.

== Incidents ==

=== Bomb Threat ===
The JOY studios were evacuated on Tuesday 20 September 2016 due to an alleged bomb threat, with the station&#x27;s programming put on auto-play to allow a thorough investigation.

=== Work Environment Complaints, Bullying Allegations &amp; Presenters Forced to Leave ===
In 2018 a letter was sent to JOY members in March, signed by 28 members, calling for the radio station&#x27;s board of directors to be sacked and replaced with a temporary board. Those behind the push listed their grievances against the current board including a lack of action, an exodus of on-air staff and volunteers and a disconnect with the LGBTI communities.

==Programming==
JOY 94.9 is the first radio station in Australia dedicated to offering programming produced by and aimed specifically at the gay, lesbian &amp; bisexual communities.
Programs on JOY incorporate a mix of talkback, music and specialist culture and lifestyle programs, including announcements promoting community events, counselling and support services and key networks supporting the gay and lesbian community. JOY 94.9 also operates a news service covering mainstream news events and issues as well those mainly concerning the gay and lesbian community and its long-running current affairs flagship, Saturday Magazine, continues to broadcast on Saturdays. The station is staffed by over 250 volunteers.

JOY 94.9 utilises online streaming audio to reach the gay and lesbian audience in the rest of Melbourne and the world.

All JOY 94.9 presenters perform their roles in voluntary capacities.

Weekend specialist programming includes current affairs and lifestyle programming and many more varied examples in the programming schedule. The JOY schedule is updated every 4 months by the JOY program director and programming committee. Many shows remain on the schedule, but new shows are only added when the schedule is updated.

===News===

JOY runs a news roster covering weekdays and weekends in the morning, noon, and drive. Many newsreaders have found employment in the commercial industry, such as Nathan Gardiner who is now a newsreader at Gold 104.3, and Anthony Laughton who was employed by Nova 100/Classic Rock 91.5 and MTR 1377.

JOY Newsreaders are volunteers.

<text>Team Sleep is an American experimental alternative rock/post-rock supergroup led by singer/guitarist Chino Moreno. Moreno is better known for fronting the Sacramento-based alternative metal band Deftones. Other recent members include guitarist Todd Wilkinson, keyboardist and turntablist CrookOne, bass guitarist and keyboardist Rick Verrett, drummer Gil Sharone, and bassist Chuck Doom, with past members Zach Hill, Rob Crow, Mary Timony, and Dan Elkan contributing significantly to the band’s debut album.

Team Sleep&#x27;s music touches on a variety of genres, including dream pop, trip hop, indie rock, post-rock, shoegaze, ambient music, psychedelic music, lo-fi music, and electronica.

==History==
===Early years===
Team Sleep started when Moreno and his friend Todd Wilkinson bought a cassette tape Portastudio-type four-track recorder in 1994. They continued this collaboration through the first two Deftones albums, though on a rather casual basis. Wilkinson said, &quot;We were never going to make a record, or start a band ... I was just sitting at home, playing guitar, and I started recording some stuff. It was never about trying to play shows, record in a studio, or anything of that sort. It was just bumming around. I had never been in a band, and I never wanted to be—we were just good friends.&quot;

DJ Crook, or CrookOne, a long-time friend and roommate of Deftones turntablist/keyboardist Frank Delgado, added beats and turntables to &quot;Teenager&quot;, a song featuring glitch and trip hop influences. Originally intended as a Team Sleep song, &quot;Teenager&quot; was ultimately included on &quot;White Pony&quot; (2000), the third Deftones album.

Team Sleep performed a number of live shows on the West Coast of the United States in late 2001 and early 2002, with Moreno, Wilkinson, DJ Crook (aka CrookOne), Verrett (of Tinfed), Zach Hill (Hella, later of Death Grips), Dan Elkan (Pocket for Corduroy/Them Hills), Sonny Mayugba (of Phallucy, the prior band of Deftones drummer Abe Cunningham) and Joel Tidwell handling instrumentation. Their early live set included a loose cover of the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; &quot;The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)&quot;, among others.

===Debut album===
A full album&#x27;s worth of material was finished in 2002–03, but not officially released. The instrumental song &quot;The Passportal&quot; was included on &quot;The Matrix Reloaded: The Album&quot;, the April 2003 soundtrack album for the film &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;.

Singers Mike Patton (Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Faith No More) and Melissa Auf der Maur (ex-Hole, ex-Smashing Pumpkins) were involved in recording sessions, but their contributions were not included on the final album. Singers Rob Crow (of San Diego-based band Pinback) and Mary Timony (of the band Helium) were the only vocalists other than Moreno to appear on the album.

Team Sleep&#x27;s record was originally scheduled for release in November 2004, but Maverick Records were reportedly so impressed by the album that they postponed the release until mid-2005 to allow for promotion. The debut album contained only five of the original tracks; three of those were heavily reworked. In October 2004, DJ C-Minus premiered the Team Sleep demo &quot;Cambodia&quot; while opening for Deftones at a concert at House of Blues in West Hollywood. The title of this song, which was co-written with producer Greg Wells, was later changed to &quot;Ever (Foreign Flag)&quot;. The official Team Sleep website appeared in early 2005 and included songs and videos for free downloading.

&quot;Team Sleep&quot; was finally released on May 10, 2005, to mostly positive reviews. &quot;The best part about it is having completion of something you&#x27;ve been working on, and having it done right,&quot; Moreno said in a statement. &quot;It&#x27;s fun, working with different people, everybody works differently. When I have time off from music, I want to make other music. That&#x27;s what I do, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s fun, that&#x27;s what makes me happy.&quot;

Notably absent from the completed debut album were &quot;Mercedes&quot;, &quot;Apollonia&quot;, &quot;Iceache&quot;, &quot;Death by Plane&quot;, &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, &quot;Acoustic One&quot; and &quot;Kool-Aid Party&quot; (which featured Mike Patton as a guest vocalist). The demo of &quot;Cambodia&quot; was revamped and appeared on the album in the form of &quot;Ever (Foreign Flag)&quot;, while &quot;Natalie Portman&quot; was revised into &quot;Live from the Stage&quot;.

Following Team Sleep&#x27;s first release, the band toured and began posting various demos on their MySpace page.

===Return===
In October 2014, a new Team Sleep lineup recorded a live album in front of an audience at Applehead Recording studio in Woodstock, New York. The members included Moreno, Wilkinson, Verret and DJ Crook as well as bassist Chuck Doom (also of Moreno&#x27;s Crosses) and drummer Gil Sharone (ex-Marilyn Manson, ex-Dillinger Escape Plan). The record, self-released in July 2015, consisted of reworkings of both tracks from the first album tracks as well as unreleased old demos.

On May 9, 2024, Team Sleep released the Deluxe Edition of their eponymous record, including official mixes of previously unreleased tracks &quot;Kool-Aid Party&quot; (retitled &quot;Kool Aide&quot;), featuring Mike Patton, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go,&quot; featuring Mary Timony.

<doc id="583954" wikidata="Q1780489" url="?curid=583954" title="Ashley Ward">
<text>Ashley Ward (born 24 November 1970) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre forward.

Having come through the Manchester City academy, he notably played in the Premier League for Norwich City, Derby County, Barnsley, Blackburn Rovers and Bradford City, as well as in the Football League with Wrexham, Leicester City, Crewe Alexandra and Sheffield United.

==Early life==
Ward was born in Middleton, Lancashire, the son of a coal mining engineer. He attended William Hulme&#x27;s Grammar School, which opted for rugby and lacrosse as the school sports over football.

==Football career==
Ward had a spell with Manchester United in the 1986–87 season, making 16 appearances for the club&#x27;s Junior B team. He then played for Cheadle Town Youth, and chose to become an apprentice at Manchester City above an offer from Blackburn Rovers.

He then played for Leicester City before a move to Crewe Alexandra, where he made his name. At the start of the 1992–93 season, Craig Hignett and Tony Naylor were a prolific strike partnership but after Hignett was signed by Middlesbrough, Ward began to feature. He made his Crewe debut in an EFL Trophy match against Wrexham at Gresty Road on 8 December 1992, and scored his first Crewe goal in a 1–1 draw against Rochdale on 12 March 1993, then adding five more before the season finished. In the following injury-affected season, he scored 13 goals in 24 appearances, including the final-day winner at Chester City that earned Crewe promotion from the third tier. He started the 1994–1995 season with three goals in Crewe&#x27;s first five fixtures, added four more in four appearances in October, then scored in six consecutive games for Crewe, including two hat-tricks (against Gresley Rovers in the FA Cup, and Chester City in the EFL Trophy).

Ward was then signed by Norwich City for £350,000 in December 1994. On his Canaries debut, he scored two first-half goals against Chelsea, then made it three goals in two games, scoring at Crystal Palace. He scored eight times in 25 appearances in total before the season finished; he then added another 10 league and three League Cup goals before a move to Derby County in March 1996.

Ward contributed to Derby&#x27;s 1996-97 Premier League campaign, scoring a late winner against Chelsea. One of his other goals came as Derby beat Manchester United 3–2 at Old Trafford. Barnsley signed Ward from Derby County in September 1997, shortly after their promotion to the Premier League. Throughout their debut season in the Premier League he scored some important goals, including the only goals in 1–0 victories against Liverpool and Aston Villa at Anfield and Villa Park, respectively.

In November 1998, whilst still playing for Barnsley in a match at Sunderland, Ward scored, missed a penalty and got sent off in the space of five minutes, with all incidents also involving Sunderland defender Darren Williams.

After spells at Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Sheffield United, Ward retired in the summer of 2005.

==Personal life==
Ward and his wife Dawn, who is known for appearing on &quot;The Real Housewives of Cheshire&quot;, run a number of businesses together, including, a commercial property business, operating &quot;Abafields&quot;, a nursing home in Bolton bought for development but now operating under a manager. He also manages a £15million luxury property development company Bilton Ward Developments. Formed in 2002 the company specialises in the building and renovation of luxury homes, however this has now gone into liquidation, mainly for footballers including Kevin Campbell and Wayne Rooney. Interior design is often done by former &quot;Changing Rooms&quot; designer Laura McCree.

In March 2011, Ward was linked with a possible move to buy Wrexham.

<text>Lee Herbert Hamilton (born April 20, 1931) is an American politician and lawyer from Indiana. He is a former member of the United States House of Representatives and a former member of the U.S. Homeland Security Advisory Council. A member of the Democratic Party, Hamilton represented the 9th congressional district of Indiana from 1965 to 1999. Following his departure from Congress, he has served on a number of governmental advisory boards, most notably as the vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission.

An outstanding basketball player, he led the Central Bears to the state title game in March 1948; he then continued his playing career at DePauw University, where he played for Coach Jay McCreary. Hamilton graduated from DePauw in 1952, and from the Indiana University School of Law in 1956. He worked as a lawyer in private practice for the next ten years in Columbus, Indiana.

Hamilton was elected to the House of Representatives as a Democrat as part of the national Democratic landslide of 1964. He chaired many committees during his tenure in office, including the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Joint Committee on Printing, and others.

As chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran (1987), Hamilton chose not to investigate President Ronald Reagan or President George H. W. Bush, stating that he did not think it would be &quot;good for the country&quot; to put the public through another impeachment trial. Hamilton was later chair of the House October Surprise Task Force (1992).

He remained in Congress until 1999; at the time he was one of two surviving members of the large Democratic freshman class of 1965 (the other being John Conyers). He was viewed as a potential Democratic vice-presidential running mate in 1984, 1988, and 1992, due to his foreign policy credentials and Indiana&#x27;s potential to turn toward the Democratic Party due to economic concerns.

==Life after Congress==
In November 2002, George W. Bush nominated Hamilton as the vice-chairman of the 9/11 Commission, officially titled The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States. On March 15, 2006, Congress announced the formation of the Iraq Study Group, organized by the United States Institute of Peace, of which Hamilton was the Democratic co-chairman, along with the former Secretary of State (under President George H. W. Bush) James A. Baker III. Hamilton, like Baker, was considered a master negotiator.

Since leaving Congress, Mr. Hamilton has served as a member of the Hart-Rudman Commission, and was co-chairman of the Commission to Investigate Certain Security Issues at Los Alamos. He sits on many advisory boards, including those to the CIA, the President&#x27;s Homeland Security Advisory Council, and the United States Army. Hamilton is an Advisory Board member and Co-Chair for the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy. He is previously the president and director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and was appointed to serve as the vice chair of the 9/11 Commission. In 2000–2001, he served as the American member of the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty, which prepared the U.N policy of Responsibility to Protect, adopted in 2005. He is also a member of the Board of Advisors of Albright Stonebridge Group. He was appointed Co-Chair of the Blue Ribbon Commission on America&#x27;s Nuclear Future from 2010 to 2012 alongside Brent Scowcroft. He is also a member of Washington D.C.–based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

Hamilton serves as a co-chair of the National Security Preparedness Group (NSPG) at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Hamilton is a co-chair with Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor of the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools. He also serves as an Advisory Board member for the Partnership for a Secure America and for America Abroad Media.

In 2004, Hamilton released the book &quot;How Congress Works and Why You Should Care&quot;, in which he explains the role, workings and the importance of Congress to everyday Americans, drawing on reflections of his time as House Representative. He also suggests improvements to Congress.

On February 25, 2011, Hamilton wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to commute Jonathan Pollard&#x27;s sentence to time served. Pollard was serving a life sentence for providing Israel with classified information, without the intent to harm the United States, a crime which normally carries a sentence of two to four years. In his letter, he stated, &quot;I do believe that he has served a disproportionately severe sentence.&quot; He also stated, &quot;I have been acquainted for many years with members of his family, especially his parents, and I know how much pain and anguish they have suffered because of their son&#x27;s incarceration.&quot; He contended that &quot;commuting his sentence is a matter of basic compassion and justice.&quot; Pollard was granted parole on July 7, 2015, and released on November 20, 2015.

On August 11, 2012, Hamilton&#x27;s wife Nancy died in an auto-related accident; no one else was injured. Prior to her death, Mrs. Hamilton was an accomplished artist. In 1981 her oil paintings and watercolors were featured in an exhibit at The Commons and in 1984 she had a one-woman show at a Seymour art gallery. Mrs. Hamilton also contributed thousands of hours at the INOVA Alexandria Virginia Hospital.

Hamilton endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.

Hamilton is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

Lee H. Hamilton serves as an honorary co-chair for the World Justice Project, an organization that works to strengthen the rule of law worldwide.

==Honors and awards==
A nine-mile stretch of I-265 and Indiana 265 in Floyd and Clark counties, part of Hamilton&#x27;s former House district, was designated the &quot;Lee H. Hamilton Highway&quot; shortly after his retirement from the House in 1999. The moniker is largely symbolic, as locals generally do not refer to the road by that name, although the name is used frequently by the traffic reporter for the area&#x27;s largest radio station, WHAS 840-AM in nearby Louisville, Kentucky.

In 1982, Hamilton was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, in honor of his outstanding prep basketball career; he led the Evansville Central Bears to three deep runs in the IHSAA tournament. In 1946, the Bears made the state semi-finals, in 1947, they made the state quarter-finals; as a senior, he led them to the championship game. He was selected All-State his senior season and was awarded the Trestor Award for mental attitude. He later starred for the DePauw Tigers, leading them in scoring average in 1951 and rebounds in 1951 and 1952.

In 2001 Lee H. Hamilton was presented the Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy Award by the American Foreign Service Association.

In 2005, Hamilton received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 2007, Hamilton was elected as an honorary fellow in the National Academy of Public Administration.

In 2011, Hamilton received the Benjamin Harrison Presidential Site Advancing American Democracy Award.

In November 2015, Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House.

In 2018, Indiana University Bloomington announced that the School of Global and International Studies will be renamed the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies in honor of Hamilton and former U.S. senator Richard Lugar, describing both as &quot;two immensely accomplished Indiana statesmen and two of the nation&#x27;s most distinguished and influential voices in foreign policy.&quot;

<doc id="583960" wikidata="Q2354965" url="?curid=583960" title="Magical Meow Meow Taruto">
<text>is a Japanese manga series created by Kaishaku. The series centers on the exploits of a race of pet cats, drawn as catgirls and the occasional catboy.

A 12-episode anime television series adaptation animated by Madhouse and TNK aired from July 5, 2001, to September 27, 2001.

==Summary==
Taruto is a little catgirl who at the beginning of the series moves to a new house in a huge city with her human owner Iori Monaka and his teenage niece Kinako. Taruto spends her days making friends and exploring her new home town; in reality Taruto is a legendary princess with special magic powers. Almost none of Taruto&#x27;s friends believe that she&#x27;s capable of using magic or that she&#x27;s a princess from a faraway kingdom, but Taruto is determined to prove it to them no matter what happens.

==Characters==

===Animals===
: 
: The protagonist of the story, Taruto is believed to be the legendary Kinka princess. She often is found goofing around and talking with her master, Iori, who she admires deeply, to the point she has a crush on him despite Iori&#x27;s being human and calls him her fiancé. She loves adventure, and she is often bullied by Charlotte. She says &quot;meow&quot; (&quot;nya-no&quot;) after almost every phrase she says, though she is the only cat who does this. Taruto usually has frustration when Iori doesn&#x27;t understand her when she tries to communicate. In the final episode it is revealed that the Kinka kingdom had two princesses. Taruto is the older sister of the twins.
: 
: Charlotte&#x27;s past remains mysterious, as to her name was given by an elder, but it is known that she escaped from the pound. Because of this past, she has shown great disliking of caged, or as she thinks of it, &quot;imprisoned&quot; animals. Charlotte is known for her stubborn attitude, and doubts that Taruto is really the Kinka princess. Charlotte has however tried to be kind to Taruto, such as trying to help her escape from Anzunko, though she only did this because she claimed it was her &quot;duty&quot;.
: 
: She has a quiet and graceful personality and seems very much the epitome of the proper Japanese girl, wearing an all-day green kimono as her everyday clothing-wear. She seems bubbly and particularly joyful. But even though she is very polite, Chitose never hesitates to speak her mind. She once had a lady cat who named Tort, but she passed on. She Chitose has a rather strange fixation with Taruto&#x27;s tail. Even though their personalities are quite different, she is best friends with Charlotte.
: 
: Ever since he was trapped in Iori&#x27;s ceiling and Taruto rescued him, Kakipi has been Taruto&#x27;s trusted sidekick. He appears to be a flying squirrel, but has difficulty flying. He was the one who came up with the idea that Taruto may be the Kinka princess, and believes this with all of his heart. He is usually trying to break Taruto of her lazy habits, but finds this job very difficult.
: 
: Chips is the leader of her mall team with her brother Nachos. Her name in Japanese, Potechi roughly translates to &quot;Potato Chips.&quot; She is a &quot;rebel&quot;, and has an obsession with collecting shiny objects. She dislikes Taruto, believing that she is &quot;weak&quot;. She has somewhat of a boyish appearance. She has one way or another an annoyance to her brother&#x27;s attraction to Taruto. Chips once stole Iori&#x27;s good luck charm, a small bottle, but after Nachos broke one of Chips&#x27; collected bottles, she realized how bad Iori must feel, and she reluctantly returns it.
: 
: Nachos&#x27; gender is often confused because of his appearance, but he is actually a boy. He is calm and laid-back, and is Chips&#x27; partner and brother, who refers to his sister Chips as &quot;boss&quot;. And he will always do what she says. He has a crush on Taruto, and even helps her and the group, such as when he came up with a plan to rescue a cat which was trapped in a house.
: 
: The wise and long-lived Chiffon is often found with her face in a book. She is very knowledgeable about all kinds of subjects. She is always seen when there is a problem, for her knowledge always comes up with a good solution. Chiffon was the one who took Charlotte in when she was a stray, and also gave Charlotte her name.
: 
: Rakugan is a very old cat, possibly as old as Chiffon or older, and calls himself a master of magic. In reality, he only knows a few ninja tricks (such as his smoke bomb, which he commonly uses for escapes and entrances). In a way, Taruto wants him to be his teacher in magic. He is the one who taught Taruto to use the &quot;Hail Tiger&quot; spell, and is willing to give advice despite the fact it doesn&#x27;t always work the way she expects.

===Humans===
: 
: Iori is Taruto&#x27;s kind master. He is very gentle but easy-going. His hobby is making all kinds of sweets and foods, and he is very good at it. He is very affectionate towards Taruto, but, since he is a human, cannot understand her and sometimes frustrates her when she is trying to communicate with him, but he seems to only hear cat language because he cannot understand her. He is smitten with Anzuko Domyoji, but she shows no interest in him whatsoever.
: 
: Kinako is Iori&#x27;s niece, and is very fond of him. She has a vibrant, independent, tomboyish personality, and likes to go on all sorts of adventures. Kinako feels lonely when Iori, whom she lives with for unknown reasons, ignores her and spends his time trying to impress Anzuko. Though they were once rivals, she is good friends with Geppei.
: 
: Anzuko is a cat collector, and once she has set her eyes on a cat, she will go to great lengths to catch it, possibly being the stereotype of a crazy cat lady. The first time she saw Taruto, she has wanted her for her cat collection. Since Iori would not give Taruto to her (despite his crush on Anzuko), so she decided to capture Taruto instead. Any time she sees Taruto she will give chase - even cutting through people&#x27;s lawns, breaking other people&#x27;s belongings, or pushing people forcibly out of her way. Her nickname that mostly close friends call her is &quot;Anko.&quot;
: 
: Geppei Okaki thinks he is better than everyone else, and acts like he is the boss of the town. However, his ex-rival, Kinako, set him straight. When they first met, they were enemies, but soon put their differences aside and became close friends, and often go on adventures together. Gallette, one of the few cat boys in the series, is his pet and goes everywhere with him. He has a pet cat named Gelette, who Taruto usually talks to for questions.

<doc id="583964" wikidata="Q360471" url="?curid=583964" title="Vladimir Bukovsky">
<text>Vladimir Konstantinovich Bukovsky (; 30 December 1942 – 27 October 2019) was a Soviet and Russian human rights activist and writer. From the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, he was a prominent figure in the Soviet dissident movement, well known at home and abroad. He spent a total of twelve years in the psychiatric prison-hospitals, labour camps, and prisons of the Soviet Union during Brezhnev rule.

After being expelled from the Soviet Union in late 1976, Bukovsky remained in vocal opposition to the Soviet system and the shortcomings of its successor regimes in Russia. An activist, a writer, and a neurophysiologist, he is celebrated for his part in the campaign to expose and halt the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.

A member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a director of the Gratitude Fund (set up in 1998 to commemorate and support former dissidents), and a member of the International Council of the New York City-based Human Rights Foundation, Bukovsky was a Senior Fellow of the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.

In 2001, Vladimir Bukovsky received the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom, awarded annually since 1993 by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

== Early life ==
Vladimir Bukovsky was born to Russian parents in the town of Belebey in the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (today the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Russian Federation), to which his family was evacuated during World War II. After the war he and his parents returned to Moscow where his father Konstantin (1908–1976) was a well-known Soviet journalist. During his last year at school Vladimir was expelled for creating and editing an unauthorised magazine. To meet the requirements to apply for a university place he completed his secondary education at evening classes. Bukovsky was enrolled at biology department of Moscow State University, but he was expelled at age 19 for criticizing Soviet state organizations, such as Komsomol.

==Soviet era==
===Rallies===
====Mayakovsky Square====
In September 1960, Bukovsky entered Moscow University to study biology. There he and some friends decided to revive the informal Mayakovsky Square poetry readings which began after a statue to the poet was unveiled in central Moscow in 1958. They made contact with earlier participants of the readings such as Vladimir Osipov, the editor of &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1960), and Yuri Galanskov who issued the &quot;Phoenix&quot; (1961), two examples of literary samizdat.

It was then that the 19-year-old Bukovsky wrote his critical notes on the Communist Youth League or Komsomol. Later, this text was given the title &quot;Theses on the Collapse of the Komsomol&quot; by the KGB. Bukovsky portrayed the USSR as an &quot;illegal society&quot; facing an acute ideological crisis. The Komsomol was &quot;moribund&quot;, he asserted, having lost both moral and spiritual authority, and he called for its democratisation. This text, and his other activities, brought Bukovsky to the attention of the authorities. He was interrogated twice before being thrown out of the university in autumn 1961.

Bukovsky was arrested on 1 June 1963. He was later convicted, in absentia, by reason of his &quot;insanity&quot;, under Article 70.1 (&quot;Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda&quot;) of the RSFSR Criminal Code. The official charge was the making and possession of photocopies of anti-Soviet literature, namely two copies of the banned work &quot;The New Class&quot; by Milovan Djilas. Bukovsky was examined by Soviet psychiatrists, declared to be mentally ill (&quot;schizophrenia&quot;), and sent for treatment at the Special Psychiatric Hospital in Leningrad where he remained for almost two years, until February 1965. It was there he became acquainted with General Petro Grigorenko, a fellow inmate.

====The Glasnost rally, 5 December 1965====
In December 1965, Bukovsky helped prepare a demonstration on Pushkin Square in central Moscow to protest against the trial of the writers Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel. He circulated the &quot;Civic Appeal&quot; by mathematician and poet Alexander Esenin-Volpin, which called on the authorities to obey the Soviet laws requiring glasnost in the judicial process, e.g. the admission of the public and the media to any trial. The demonstration on 5 December 1965 (Constitution Day) became known as the Glasnost Meeting or rally, and marked the beginning of the openly active Soviet civil rights movement.

Bukovsky himself was unable to attend. Three days earlier he was arrested, charged with distributing the appeal, and kept in various psikhushkas, among them Hospital No 13 at Lublino, Stolbovaya and the Serbsky Institute, until July 1966.

====The Right to Demonstrate, 1967====
On 22 January 1967, Bukovsky, Vadim Delaunay, Yevgeny Kushev and Victor Khaustov held another demonstration on Pushkin Square. They were protesting against the recent arrests of Alexander Ginzburg, Yuri Galanskov, Alexei Dobrovolsky and Vera Lashkova (finally prosecuted in January 1968 in the Trial of the Four) and asserting their own right to protest: on 16 September 1966 a new law, Article 190.3, had been introduced which classified any public gatherings or demonstrations as a crime.

On 1 September 1967, at his own trial, Bukovsky used his final words to attack the regime&#x27;s failure to respect the law or follow legal procedures. He invoked Article 125 of the (still current) 1936 Soviet Constitution to defend the right to organise demonstrations and other public protests. He further suggested that the prosecution had repeatedly failed to observe the revised 1961 Code of Criminal Procedure in its conduct of the case. Bukovsky&#x27;s final words in court circulated widely in a samizdat collection of such addresses and as part of a collection of materials about the demonstration and subsequent trials compiled by Pavel Litvinov.

Fellow protestors Vadim Delaunay and Yevgeny Kushev admitted regret for their actions but not their guilt; they received suspended sentences and were released. Bukovsky was defiant and, like fellow demonstrator Victor Khaustov (convicted in February 1967), was given three years in an &quot;ordinary regime&quot; corrective-labour camp. Bukovsky was sent to Bor in the Voronezh Region to serve his sentence. He was released in January 1970.

====The Campaign against the Abuse of Psychiatry====
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Soviet authorities began the widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.

During a clandestine interview filmed by CBS News correspondent Bill Cole in a forest near Moscow, Bukovsky described how the Soviet government was committing political dissidents to mental institutions and subjecting them to drug treatments.
That interview along with interviews with Andrei Amalrik and Pyotr Yakir were smuggled out of the country by Canadian diplomats and aired in 1970 in the CBS News special report &quot;Voices from the Soviet Underground.&quot;
In 1971, Bukovsky managed to smuggle to the West over 150 pages further documenting the political abuse of psychiatric institutions in the Soviet Union. In a letter addressed to &quot;Western psychiatrists&quot; and written in a deliberately restrained tone, Bukovsky asked them to consider if the evidence justified the isolation of several dissidents, and urged them to discuss the matter at the next International Congress of Psychiatrists.

The documents were released to the press in March 1971 by a small French group called the International Committee for the Defence of Human Rights. Bukovsky&#x27;s letter appeared on 12 March in &quot;The Times&quot; (London) and later in the &quot;British Journal of Psychiatry&quot; Bukovsky was arrested on 29 March and held in custody for nine months before being put on trial in January 1972.

The information Bukovsky had gathered and sent to the West galvanised human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical &quot;Chronicle of Current Events&quot;, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky&#x27;s friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried and sent to the camps or a special psychiatric hospital.

Responding to public pressure, the World Psychiatric Association finally condemned Soviet practices at its Sixth World Congress in 1977 and set up a review committee to monitor misuse. In 1983, the Soviet representatives withdrew from the World Psychiatric Association rather than face expulsion. Bukovsky later characterised this reaction as &quot;the most important victory for the dissident form of glasnost&quot;.

===Final arrest (1971) and imprisonment===
Following the release of the documents, Bukovsky was denounced in &quot;Pravda&quot; as a &quot;malicious hooligan, engaged in anti-Soviet activities&quot; and arrested on 29 March 1971. At first held in Lefortovo Prison, in August, Bukovsky spent approximately three months in the Serbsky Institute, which this time pronounced him mentally sound and able to stand trial.

During the trial in January 1972 Bukovsky was accused of slandering Soviet psychiatry, contacts with foreign journalists, and the possession and distribution of samizdat. On this occasion he again used his final words to the court to reach a much wider audience when the text circulated in samizdat. He was sentenced to two years in prison, five in a labour camp, and five more in internal exile.

While in prison Bukovsky and his fellow inmate, the psychiatrist Semyon Gluzman, wrote a brief 20-page &quot;Manual on Psychiatry for Dissidents&quot;, which was widely published abroad, in Russian (1975) and in many other languages, including English, French, Italian, German, and Danish. It instructed potential victims of political psychiatry how to behave during interrogation to avoid being diagnosed as mentally ill.

===Deportation from the USSR (1976)===
The fate of Bukovsky and other political prisoners in the Soviet Union had been repeatedly brought to world attention by Western diplomats and human rights groups such as the relatively new Amnesty International formed in 1961.

In December 1976, Bukovsky was deported from the USSR and exchanged at Zürich airport by the Soviet government for the imprisoned general secretary of the Communist Party of Chile, Luis Corvalán. In his 1978 autobiography Bukovsky describes how he was brought to Switzerland in handcuffs. The widely publicised exchange increased public awareness in the West about Soviet dissidents. A fellow dissident, Vadim Delaunay wrote an epigram on the occasion about the exchange of &quot;hooligan&quot; Bukovsky:

&lt;poem&gt;
They exchanged a &quot;hooligan&quot; 
For the Luis Corvalan. 
What it would be kind of bitch
One could try to Brezhnev switch?&quot;&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

In March 1977, US President Jimmy Carter met with Bukovsky at the White House. In the USSR the meeting was seen by dissidents and rights activists as a sign of the newly elected president&#x27;s willingness to stress human rights in his foreign policy; the event provoked harsh criticism by Soviet leaders.

Bukovsky moved to Great Britain where he settled in Cambridge and resumed his studies in biology, disrupted fifteen years earlier (see above) by his expulsion from Moscow University.

====Life in the West====
Bukovsky gained a master&#x27;s degree in Biology at Cambridge University. He also wrote and published &quot;To Build a Castle: My Life as a Dissenter&quot; (1978). (The title in Russian, &quot;And the Wind Returns ...&quot;, is a Biblical allusion.) The book was translated into English, French and German. It was published in Russian the following year by Chalidze publishers in New York. Today the Russian original is available online via a number of websites.

Since he has lived in the West, Bukovsky has written many essays and polemical articles. These not only criticised the Soviet regime and, later, that of Vladimir Putin, but also exposed &quot;Western gullibility&quot; in the face of Soviet abuses and, in some cases, what he believed to be Western complicity in such crimes. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Bukovsky campaigned successfully for an official UK and US boycott of the summer 1980 Olympics in Moscow. During the same years he voiced concern about the activities and policies of the Western peace movements.
In 1983, together with Cuban dissident Armando Valladares, Bukovsky co-founded and was later elected president of Resistance International. The anti-Communist organisation was run from a small office in Paris by Soviet dissidents and emigres, notably Vladimir Maximov and Eduard Kuznetsov. In 1985 it expanded into the American Foundation for Resistance International. Among the prominent members of the board were Albert Jolis and Jeane Kirkpatrick while Midge Decter, Yuri Yarim-Agaev, Richard Perle, Saul Bellow, Robert Conquest and Martin Colman were on the body&#x27;s advisory committee. The Foundation aimed to be a co-ordinating centre for dissident and democratic movements seeking to overturn communism in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. It organised protests in the communist countries and in the West, and opposed western financial assistance to communist governments. The Foundation also created the National Council to Support Democratic Movements (National Council for Democracy) with the goal of aiding the emergence of democratic rule-of-law governments, and providing assistance with the writing of constitutions and the formation of civil institutions.

In March 1987, Bukovsky and nine other émigré authors (Ernst Neizvestny, Yury Lyubimov, Vasily Aksyonov and Leonid Plyushch among them) caused a furore in the West and then in the Soviet Union itself when they raised doubts about the substance and sincerity of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms.

===Return to the Soviet Union (1991)===
In April 1991, Vladimir Bukovsky visited Moscow for the first time since his deportation fifteen years before.

In the run-up to the 1991 presidential election, Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s campaign team included Bukovsky on their list of potential vice-presidential running-mates. In the end, army officer Alexander Rutskoy, a veteran of the 1979–1989 war in Afghanistan and Hero of the Soviet Union was selected. On 5 December 1991, both of Bukovsky&#x27;s Soviet-era convictions were annulled by a decree of the RSFSR Supreme Court. The following year President Yeltsin formally restored Bukovsky&#x27;s Russian citizenship: he had never been deprived of his Soviet citizenship, despite deportation from the country.

==Post-Soviet period==
British and European psychiatrists assessing the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterised him in 1971: &quot;The information we have about [Vladimir Bukovsky] suggests that he is the sort of person who might be embarrassing to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him. But such people often have much to contribute, and deserve considerable respect.&quot;

Soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union Vladimir Bukovsky was again out of favour with the Russian authorities. He supported Yeltsin against the Supreme Soviet in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in October that year but criticised the new Constitution of Russia approved two months later, as being designed to ensure a continuation of Yeltsin&#x27;s power. According to Bukovsky, Yeltsin became a hostage of the security agencies from 1994 onwards, and a restoration of KGB rule was inevitable.

=== &quot;Judgment in Moscow&quot; ===

In 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, President Yeltsin&#x27;s government invited Bukovsky to serve as an expert witness at the trial before the Constitutional Court where Russia&#x27;s communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their Party and taking its property. The respondent&#x27;s case was that the CPSU itself had been an unconstitutional organisation. To prepare his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from the CPSU Central Committee archives (then reorganised into the Central Depository for Contemporary Documentation or TsKhSD). With the help of a small hand-held scanner and a laptop computer, he managed secretly to make photocopies of many of the documents (some with high security clearance), including KGB reports to the Central Committee. The copies were then smuggled to the West.

Bukovsky hoped that an international tribunal in Moscow might play a similar role to the first Nuremberg Trial (1945–1946) in post-Nazi Germany and help the country begin to overcome the legacy of Communism.

It took several years and a team of assistants to piece together the scanned fragments (many only half a page in width) of the hundreds of documents photocopied by Bukovsky and then, in 1999, to make them available online. Many of the same documents were extensively quoted and cited in Bukovsky&#x27;s &quot;Judgment in Moscow&quot; (1995), where he described and analysed what he had uncovered about recent Soviet history and about the relations of the USSR and the CPSU with the West.

The book was soon translated into several languages but did not appear in English for over twenty years. Random House bought the rights to the manuscript, but the publisher, in Bukovsky&#x27;s words, tried to make the author &quot;rewrite the whole book from the liberal left political perspective.&quot; Bukovsky resisted, explaining to the Random House editor that he was &quot;allergic to political censorship&quot; because of &quot;certain peculiarities of my biography&quot;. (The contract was subsequently cancelled.). Meanwhile, the book was published in French as &quot;Jugement à Moscou&quot; (1995), in Russian (1996) and in certain other Slavic languages: for a time the Polish edition became a best-seller. In 2016, it was published in Italian, by Spirali, with the title &quot;Gli archivi segreti di Mosca&quot;. An English language translation did not appear in book form until May 2019, five months before the author died.

On 30 March 2011, Bukovsky requested the arrest of Mikhail Gorbachev by the British authorities after submitting to Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court materials on crimes against humanity that the former Soviet leader had allegedly committed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by ordering military suppression of demonstrations in Lithuania, Tbilisi, Baku and Tajikistan.

===Potential 1996 presidential candidacy===

In early 1996, a group of Moscow academics, journalists and intellectuals suggested that Vladimir Bukovsky should run for President of Russia as an alternative candidate to both incumbent President Boris Yeltsin and his main challenger Gennady Zyuganov of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. However, no formal nomination process was initiated.

===&quot;Memento Gulag&quot;===
In 2001, Bukovsky was elected President of the &quot;Comitatus pro Libertatibus – Comitati per le Libertà – Freedom Committees&quot; in Florence, an Italian libertarian organisation which promoted an annual &quot;Memento Gulag&quot;, or Memorial Day devoted to the Victims of Communism, on 7 November (the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution). The &quot;Memento Gulag&quot; has since been held in Rome, Bucharest, Berlin, La Roche sur Yon and Paris.

===Contacts with Boris Nemtsov and the Russian Opposition===
In 2002, Boris Nemtsov, former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia who was then an elected member of the State Duma and leader of the Union of Rightist Forces, paid a visit to Bukovsky in Cambridge. He wanted to discuss the strategy of the Russian opposition. It was imperative, Bukovsky told Nemtsov, that Russian liberals adopt an uncompromising stand toward what he saw as the authoritarian government of President Vladimir Putin.

In January 2004, with Garry Kasparov, Boris Nemtsov, Vladimir V. Kara-Murza and others, Bukovsky was a co-founder of Committee 2008. This umbrella organisation of the Russian democratic opposition was formed to ensure free and fair elections in 2008 when a successor to Vladimir Putin was elected.

In 2005, Bukovsky was among the prominent dissidents of the 1960s and 1970s (Gorbanevskaya, Sergei Kovalyov, Eduard Kuznetsov, Alexander Podrabinek, Yelena Bonner) who took part in a documentary series by Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. &quot;They Chose Freedom&quot;. In 2013 Bukovsky was featured in a documentary series by Natella Boltyanskaya &quot;Parallels, Events, People&quot;.

In 2009, Bukovsky joined the council of the new Solidarnost coalition which brought together a wide range of extra-parliamentary opposition forces.

===Criticism of torture in Abu Ghraib prison (Iraq)===
As revelations mounted about the sanctioned torture of captives in the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, Abu Ghraib and the CIA secret prisons, Bukovsky entered the discussion with an uncompromising attack on the official if covert rationalisation of torture. In an 18 December 2005 op-ed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Bukovsky recounted his experience under torture in Lefortovo prison in 1971. Once commenced, he warned, the inertia of torture was difficult to control, corrupting those who carried it out. &quot;Torture&quot;, he wrote, &quot;has historically been an instrument of oppression—not an instrument of investigation or of intelligence gathering.&quot; Bukovsky explained:

US President Barack Obama repudiated the Torture Memos on 20 January 2009, two days after taking office.

===Russian agents in the European Union===

In &quot;EUSSR&quot;, a booklet written with Pavel Stroilov and published in 2004, Bukovsky exposed what he saw as the &quot;Soviet roots of European Integration&quot;. Two years later, in an interview with &quot;The Brussels Journal&quot;, Bukovsky said he had read confidential documents from secret Soviet files in 1992 which confirmed the existence of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; to turn the European Union into a socialist organisation. The European Union was a &quot;monster&quot;, he argued, and it must be destroyed, the sooner the better, &quot;before it develops into a full-fledged totalitarian state&quot;. As an expression of his Eurosceptic position Bukovsky was vice-president of The Freedom Association (TFA) in the United Kingdom.

Ten years earlier, Bukovsky sketched some of the ways in which cooperation was secured. Beyond those who were recruited as Soviet agents and consciously worked for the USSR, as he explained in &quot;Judgment in Moscow&quot; (1995), there were men and women whom the KGB and GRU classified as &quot;agents of influence&quot; and &quot;confidential contacts&quot;:

This applied equally, Bukovsky cautioned, to post-Stalin generations of specialists on the USSR and Eastern Europe. They had been subjected to similar pressures and inducements in the 1970s and 1980s:

===2008 presidential candidacy===
In May 2007, Bukovsky announced his plans to run as candidate for president in the May 2008 Russian presidential election. On 16 December 2007, Bukovsky was officially nominated to run against Dmitry Medvedev and other candidates.The group that nominated Bukovsky as a candidate included Yuri Ryzhov, Vladimir V. Kara-Murza, Alexander Podrabinek, Andrei Piontkovsky, Vladimir Pribylovsky and others. Activists, authors and commentators such as Viktor Shenderovich, Valeriya Novodvorskaya and Lev Rubinstein also favoured Bukovsky.

Responding to pro-Kremlin politicians and commentators who expressed doubt about Bukovsky&#x27;s electoral prospects, his nominators rejected a number of frequently repeated allegations. In Moscow more than 800 citizens of the Russian Federation nominated Bukovsky for president on 16 December 2007. Bukovsky secured the required number of signatures to register and submitted his application to the Central Election Commission on time, 18 December 2007.

Bukovsky&#x27;s candidacy received the support of Grigory Yavlinsky, who announced on 14 December 2007 at the Yabloko party conference that he would forgo a campaign of his own and would instead support Bukovsky.

On 22 December 2007, the Central Electoral Commission turned down Bukovsky&#x27;s application, on the grounds that he had failed to give information about his activities as a writer when submitting his documents, that he was holding a British residence permit, and that he had not been living in Russia during the past ten years. Bukovsky appealed against the decision at the RF Supreme Court on 28 December 2007 and, subsequently, before its cassation board on 15 January 2008.

===Conflict with Putin&#x27;s regime===
Bukovsky was among the first 34 signatories of &quot;Putin must go&quot;, an online anti-Putin manifesto published on 10 March 2010. In May 2012, Vladimir Putin began his third term as president of the Russian Federation after serving four years as the country&#x27;s prime minister. The following year, Bukovsky published a collection of interviews in Russia which described Putin and his team as &quot;The heirs of Lavrentiy Beria&quot;, Stalin&#x27;s last and most notorious secret police chief.

In March 2014 Russia annexed Crimea after Ukraine had lost control of its government buildings, airports and military bases in Crimea to unmarked soldiers and local pro-Russian militias. The West responded with sanctions targeted at Putin&#x27;s immediate entourage, and Bukovsky expressed the hope that this would prove the end of his regime.

In October 2014, the Russian authorities declined to issue Bukovsky with a new foreign-travel passport. The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that it could not confirm Bukovsky&#x27;s citizenship. The response was met with surprise from the Presidential Human Rights Council and the Human Rights ombudsman of the Russian Federation.

On 17 March 2015, at the long-delayed inquiry into Alexander Litvinenko&#x27;s fatal poisoning Bukovsky gave his views as to why Litvinenko had been assassinated. Interviewed on BBC TV eight years before, Bukovsky expressed no doubt that the Russian authorities were responsible for the London death of Litvinenko on 23 November 2006.

=== Child pornography case ===
On October 28, 2014, Bukovsky was accused in the UK of the possession of child pornography. In April 2015, Bukovsky was charged with multiple counts of the production and possession of child pornography. Bukovsky pleaded not guilty to the charges. A prosecutor made several allegations to the court: that Bukovsky admitted to possessing child abuse materials which he downloaded over the course of 15 years, and that he described the activity as a &quot;hobby&quot; and &quot;research&quot;. Forensic examination of Bukovsky&#x27;s hard drives revealed thousands of child abuse images and videos – some category A – featuring mostly boys and children of toddler age, a court was told.

Bukovsky denied &quot;making any indecent or prohibited photographs, pseudo-photographs or videos of children&quot;. Bukovsky protested the charges with a hunger strike and sued the Crown Prosecution Service for libel. The Court of Appeals dismissed the libel claim. Due to several health complications and medical operations, his trials were delayed multiple times and were eventually halted indefinitely.

Bukovsky said he was a victim of a smear campaign by Russian state security services whose hackers have planted the images on his computer. The initial examination of his computer by police expert did not find any evidence of the hacking. The prosecution requested for more time &quot;to review an independent forensic report on what had been found on Mr. Bukovsky&#x27;s computers and how an unidentified third party had probably put it there&quot;, but the case was halted. According to a book by investigative journalist Bill Gertz, Bukovsky was targeted &quot;in a Russian disinformation operation shortly before he was to testify before the Owen commission in March 2015. A Russian hacker broke into his laptop computer and planted child pornography photographs on the device. A Russian intelligence agent then tipped off the European Union law enforcement agency, Europol, to the photos... It was a classic Russian disinformation and influence operation&quot;.

==Death==

Bukovsky died of a heart attack on 27 October 2019 at the age of 76 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. He is buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="583989" wikidata="Q4970694" url="?curid=583989" title="British Rail Class 10">
<text>The British Rail Class 10 diesel locomotives are a variant of the standard Class 08 diesel-electric shunter with a Lister Blackstone diesel engine and General Electric Company plc (GEC) traction motors. The locomotives were built at the BR Works in Darlington and Doncaster over the period 1955–1962, and were withdrawn between February 1967 and June 1972. 

==Background==
British Railways built four main variants of its standard large diesel-electric shunter. Those fitted with a Lister Blackstone diesel engine were classified D3/4 if they had GEC traction motors and D3/5 with British Thomson-Houston (BTH) traction motors. The D3/4 locomotives were later reclassified to become Class 10 under TOPS.

==Technical details==
The locomotives had the same general outline, 0-6-0 wheel arrangement and outside frames as the earlier Class 11, built originally for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway after 1945, and perpetuated by British Railways as the Class 08. However, they were fitted with Lister Blackstone 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, ER6T engines and two GEC nose suspended motors.

==Building and use==
The first batch of thirty locomotives, originally numbered 13137–13151, (later renumbered D3137–D3151) were built at Darlington works during 1955, and allocated to motive power depots in the North Eastern Region of British Railways, notably Thornaby. Further batches were built at Darlington as follows: D3439–D3453 (1957); D3473–D3491 (1957/8); D3612–D3651 (1958); D4049–D4094 (1961/2). These were allocated to the Eastern Region of British Railways particularly in the London area. Six examples, D3497–D3502, were built at Doncaster (1957/8). The class eventually numbered 146 locomotives.

==Withdrawal==
As they were non-standard, compared to the 08 class they had relatively short lives and were withdrawn between February 1967 and June 1972. Twenty locomotives were sold to industrial customers.

==Post BR Use==
==Preservation==

Four examples have been preserved:
* D3452 at Bodmin and Wenford Railway
* D3489 at Spa Valley Railway
* D4067 at Great Central Railway
* D4092 at Barrow Hill Engine Shed
* A fifth example, D3476, was stored on the Colne Valley Railway, though has since been scrapped.

<doc id="583999" wikidata="Q4779271" url="?curid=583999" title="Ape Canyon">
<text>Ape Canyon is a gorge along the edge of the Plains of Abraham, on the southeast shoulder of Mount St. Helens in the U.S. state of Washington. The gorge narrows to as close as eight feet (2.5 m) at one point. The name alludes to a legend about a 1924 encounter with &quot;apemen&quot; which was later incorporated into Bigfoot folklore. Ape Canyon was heavily impacted by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Adjacent to the steep rocky canyon is the present Ape Canyon trail, popular with hikers and mountain bikers. On the south side of the mountain is another feature named Ape Cave.

==Legend==
In the summer of 1924, a group of gold prospectors claimed that tall ape-like animals attacked them with boulders. According to their tale, they came across the animals in the wilderness, and when one of the group fired a rifle at one of the animals, he struck it three times, and saw the wounded animal topple off a cliff into an inaccessible canyon. The ape men supposedly returned later to bombard their cabin with large stones and leave giant footprints. The story caused a local sensation, prompting U.S. Forest Service rangers J.H. Huffman and William Welch to investigate. Huffman and Welch descended into the supposedly &quot;inaccessible canyon&quot; but found nothing. They demonstrated how long footprints found near the cabin could easily be faked, and concluded the miners probably placed large stones near the cabin themselves to bolster their tale. Despite the story being debunked by the rangers, &quot;people still wanted to believe&quot;, and the prospectors&#x27; story was repeated and continued to spread in later years, inspiring new theories and claims of new sightings.

<text>AQA Education, trading as AQA (formerly the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance), is an awarding body in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It compiles specifications and holds examinations in various subjects at GCSE, AS and A Level and offers vocational qualifications. AQA is a registered charity and independent of the government. However, its qualifications and exam syllabi are regulated by the Government of the United Kingdom, which is the regulator for the public examinations system in England and Wales.

AQA is one of five awarding bodies which are recognised by schools across the country. AQA is also recognised by the regulators of the public exams systems for England, Wales and Northern Ireland to offer GCSE, AS and A Levels in the United Kingdom. AQA also offers the AQA Baccalaureate, a qualification also intended for students in Year 12 and 13 and which includes the study of three A-Levels, an extended project and extra-curricular enrichment activities. AQA is the largest examination board for GCSEs and GCE A Levels in England.
The organisation has several regional offices, the largest being in Milton Keynes, Guildford and Manchester.

==History==
AQA was originally formed on 7 November 1997 as an alliance of NEAB and AEB/SEG exam boards and City &amp; Guilds vocational awarding body. NEAB and AEB/SEG formally merged on 1 April 2000. City &amp; Guilds chose to remain independent of the new organisation, but transferred its GNVQ provision to AQA.

AQA holds the candidate records and awards for the following historic exam boards:

* Associated Examining Board (AEB) 
* Associated Lancashire Schools Examinations Board (ALSEB)
* Joint Matriculation Board (JMB)
* Northern Examining Association (NEA) 
* Northern Examinations and Assessment Board (NEAB)
* North Regional Examinations Board (NREB)
* North West Regional Examinations Board (NWREB)
* North West Secondary Schools Examinations Board (NWSSEB)
* Southern Examining Group (SEG)
* South Eastern Regional Examinations (SEREB)
** University of Bristol School Examinations Council (UBSEC)
* South West Regional Examinations Board (SWREB) 
* Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Examinations Board (YHREB)
** Yorkshire Regional Examinations Board (YREB) 
** The West Yorkshire and Lindsey Regional Examinations Board (TWYLREB)

==Examination reform==
The Conservative Party under Prime Minister David Cameron initiated reforms for A Levels to change from a modular structure to a linear one. British examination boards (Edexcel, AQA, OCR and WJEC) regulated and accredited by the Government of the United Kingdom responded to the government&#x27;s reform announcements by modifying syllabi of several A Level subjects. However, the Labour Party and in particular the member of parliament Tristram Hunt announced that it would seek to halt and reverse the reforms and maintain the modular A-Level system. Labour&#x27;s policy, and the modular AS- and A-Level system, are supported and promoted by the University of Cambridge and by the University of Oxford.

The organisation announced that it will begin offering courses for which all assessment is carried out through examinations at the end of the course. This is commonly referred to as a linear course. Beforehand, they offered modular courses in England with several exams.

==Controversies==
During the summer 2022 exam series, AQA came under heavy criticism after several of its exam papers contained topics not included in the subject specific &#x27;advance information&#x27;. Following an announcement from the exams regulator Ofqual in December 2021, exam boards were required to produce advance information, covering the &#x27;focus&#x27; of exams, to alleviate the disruption experienced by pupils during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2022, GCSE Physics Higher Paper One contained a 9-mark question on energy transfers and circuits. Advance Information had listed &quot;series and parallel circuits&quot; as a topic &quot;not assessed&quot; in the paper. Following the error, AQA announced that full marks would be awarded for the offending question, guaranteeing nine marks for each pupil who sat the paper. In addition, AQA announced that it would be performing &quot;extra checks on the advance information and question papers for future exams&quot;.

In relation to the June 2022 A Level Physics Paper Two, claims were made that advance information provided to pupils misleadingly stated that questions relating to Electric Fields and Capacitance would only be present synoptically and in low tariff questions; these topics made up the third question of the paper, worth 12 marks, and came up 8 times in the multiple choice section, in total these topics made up 23.5% of the 85 mark paper. The perceived error lead to significant backlash on social media. AQA responded by defending the paper, stating that the two topics were separate and therefore &quot;neither carried enough marks to be included in the advance information list&quot;.

On 17 June 2022, AQA apologised after A-level Law Paper Two contained a 30 mark question on Rylands v Fletcher and Private nuisance, accounting for 30% of the 100 mark paper, which had not been included in the advance information. In response, AQA stated that it would &quot;look at how students performed&quot; after the paper had been marked and that it would &quot;take any action necessary to protect [pupils].&quot;

On 17 June 2022, exams regulator Ofqual criticised AQA and other exam boards for the &#x27;distress&#x27; which mistakes on the advance information had caused pupils.

Shortly following the AQA A-Level Chemistry paper 2 (sat on the morning of 20 June 2022) photographs surfaced on social media, namely Twitter, showing the paper had been leaked potentially up to seven days before it took place. Throughout the day that followed, AQA were reluctant to comment on the matter. This revelation was met with frustration and disbelief from students, teachers, and parents.

In 2024, it was reported that the AQA&#x27;s Chinese-language GCSE textbook removed all references to the Taiwan under pressure from the Embassy of China, London.

==Chief executives==
The Chief Executive of AQA runs the organisation on a day-to-day basis, while being accountable to the AQA Council. The role was known as the Director General from its introduction in April 1998 until July 2010.

* Kathleen Tattersall, 1 April 1998 – 30 September 2003
* Mike Cresswell , 1 October 2003 – 31 March 2010
* Andrew Hall, 4 June 2010 – 31 August 2017
* Toby Salt, 1 September 2017 – 8 September 2019
* Mark Bedlow, 9 September 2019 – 31 August 2020 (interim chief executive)
* Colin Hughes, 1 September 2020–

<doc id="584001" wikidata="Q18288" url="?curid=584001" title="Katyusha (song)">
<text>&quot;Katyusha&quot; ( ; a diminutive form of ) is a Soviet-era folk-based song and military march composed by Matvey Blanter in 1938, with lyrics in Russian written by the Soviet poet Mikhail Isakovsky.

It gained fame during World War II as a patriotic song, inspiring the population to serve and defend their land in the war effort.

The song is the source of the nickname of the BM-8, BM-13, and BM-31 &quot;Katyusha&quot; rocket launchers that were used by the Red Army in World War II.

==Song==
The song is about a Russian woman named Katyusha. Standing on a steep riverbank, she sings a song to her beloved, a soldier serving far away. The theme of the song is that the soldier will protect the Motherland and its people while his grateful woman will keep and protect their love. Its lyrics became relevant during the Second World War, when many Soviet men left their wives and girlfriends to serve in the Soviet Army during World War II, known in Russia as The Great Patriotic War.

==Performance history==
The song&#x27;s popularity began to increase with the beginning of Operation Barbarossa launched by Germany against the Soviet Union. The song was sung by female students from a Soviet industrial school in Moscow, bidding farewell to soldiers going to the battle front against Nazi Germany. Its first official performance was by Valentina Batishcheva in the Column Hall of Moscow&#x27;s House of the Unions, at the State Jazz Orchestra concert in the autumn of 1938. It has since been performed many times by other famous singers, including Lidia Ruslanova, Tamara Sinyavskaya, Georgi Vinogradov, Eduard Khil, Anna German, Ivan Rebroff, Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Joseph Kobzon and more. &quot;Katyusha&quot; is part of the repertoire of the Alexandrov Ensemble.

==In other languages==

In 1943, the Kingdom of Italy, until then one of the Axis powers, joined the Allies. During the next two years, Italian partisans fought against German forces in Italy and Italian Fascists. wrote Italian lyrics for &quot;Katyusha&quot;. His adaptation, &quot;Fischia il vento&quot; (The Wind Blows), became one of the most famous partisan anthems, along with &quot;La Brigata Garibaldi&quot;.

During the last battles on the Eastern Front, the Blue Division used the melody of &quot;Katyusha&quot; for an adaptation called &quot;Primavera&quot; (Spring), a chant extolling the value of Spanish francoist fighters.

During the Greek Civil War (1946–1949), Greek partisans who fought against the German invasion in 1941 wrote their version of &quot;Katyusha&quot; named &quot;Ο ύμνος του ΕΑΜ&quot; (The Hymn of EAM). The text to the melody was written by Vassilis Rotas, recorded much later by Thanos Mikroutsikos and sung by Maria Dimitriadi.

Katyusha is also a popular song sung in the People&#x27;s Republic of China due to influence from the Soviet Union in the second half of the 20th century and is still widely popular. During the 2015 Moscow Victory Day Parade, the Chinese honor guard contingent led by Li Bentao surprised hundreds of locals when they sang Katyusha during their march back to their living quarters during a nighttime rehearsal. That same parade saw the song being performed by the Massed Bands of the Moscow Garrison during the march of foreign contingents (specifically that of India, Mongolia, Serbia and China).

It is a popular song in Iceland (particularly among schoolchildren) where it is known as &quot;&quot; (&quot;Be Ready When Spring Calls&quot;), the lyrics by Tryggvi Þorsteinsson encourage hard work in the hayfields in spring.

<text>Edexcel (also known since 2013 as Pearson Edexcel) is a British multinational education and examination body formed in 1996 and wholly owned by Pearson plc since 2005. It is the only privately owned examination board in the United Kingdom. Its name is a portmanteau term combining the words education&quot; and excellence&quot;.

Edexcel regulates school examinations under the British Curriculum and offers qualifications for schools on the international and regional scale. It is the UK&#x27;s largest awarding organisation offering academic and vocational qualifications in schools, colleges and work places in the UK and abroad. It is also recognised internationally. In 2019, Edexcel was the focus of significant controversy following a leak of an A-level examination.

==History==
Edexcel was formed in 1996 by the merger of two bodies, the BTEC (Business &amp; Technology Education Council) and ULEAC (University of London Examinations and Assessment Council). In 2003, the Edexcel Foundation (the charity that managed the board) formed a partnership with Pearson plc to set up a new company called London Qualifications Ltd, which was 75% owned by Pearson and 25% by the Edexcel Foundation. London Qualifications Limited changed its name to Edexcel Limited in November 2004 and is now known colloquially as Edexcel and formally as Edexcel Pearson - London Examinations.

In 2005, Edexcel became the only large examination board to be held in private hands, when Pearson plc took complete control. Edexcel subsequently received investment from their new parent company.

Edexcel also offers IAL, known as International Advanced Levels. It is offered only to schools outside the UK. It is considered by the UK NARIC (the National Recognition Information Centre for the United Kingdom) to be of a comparable standard as the GCE Advanced Level. In addition, Edexcel provides the Edexcel International Diploma (ID) which involves the study of 4 A-Levels (3 full A-Levels and 1 AS-Level in either General Studies or Global Development). The British curriculum offered by the Edexcel International board is among the most taught at International Schools along with the curricula offered by Cambridge International Examinations and, the International Baccalaureate Organization.

On 3 April 2013, Pearson rebranded Edexcel and all of its exams &#x27;Pearson Edexcel&#x27;, in line with a name change that added the prefix &#x27;Pearson&#x27; to all of its brands.

===Incorporated examination boards===
* Business Education Council (BEC)
* Business and Technology Education Council (BTEC)
*East Anglian Examinations Board (EAEB) – partial
* Joint Committee for Business Studies and Public Administration (JCBSPA)
*London East Anglia Group (LEAG)
* London Regional Examining Board (LREB) – created in 1979
** Metropolitan and Middlesex Regional Examining Boards (M&amp;MREB) – created in 1979
*** Metropolitan Regional Examination Board (MREB)
*** Middlesex Regional Examination Board (MREB)
* Technician Education Council (TEC)
* University Entrance and Schools Examinations Council (UESEC)
* University of London Examinations and Assessment Council (ULEAC)
* University of London Schools Examination Board (ULSEB)

==Controversies==
As Edexcel is the only privately owned examination board in the UK, questions have been raised on whether the examination board is acting in the best interest of students, or solely as a profit making business, due to the wide range of Edexcel-endorsed text books published by Pearson, the international multi-billion company which owns the board.

=== 2007 ===
In 2007 it was reported that teachers using Edexcel Music examinations were allowing students to listen to confidential listening paper CDs several days before the examination, by abusing the trust given by the exam board to only check for technical issues. Other exam boards do not allow the practice of checking discs, with AQA specifically instructing teachers not to open the packages containing the CDs before exams.

=== 2013 ===
In 2013, the loss of an A-Level C3 Mathematics exam being delivered to an international school in Amsterdam led to a replacement paper being published for the Summer examination series. However, 60 students took the original paper due to it mistakenly being handed out in two UK and two overseas centres, while the replacement paper was taken by 34,000 students. The replacement paper was criticised for its unusually high difficulty level, and there were concerns that the students taking the original paper would be unfairly marked.

=== 2015 ===

==== Difficulty ====
In June 2015, students across the United Kingdom who had taken an Edexcel GCSE Maths paper expressed anger and confusion over questions that &quot;did not make sense&quot; and were &quot;ridiculous&quot;, mocking the exam on Twitter. On a Sky News segment, presenter Adam Boulton answered one of the paper&#x27;s &#x27;hardest&#x27; questions with a former maths teacher. As a result, GCSE students across the UK signed a petition made by a candidate requesting that the exam board lowers the grade boundaries as the examination was too hard.

==== Gender representation ====
An additional petition was started by a 17-year-old student requesting to &quot;Ensure the representation of women on the A-Level Music syllabus.&quot; The petition asks that music composed by women be added to the Edexcel A-Level Music syllabus which &quot;has a total of 63 different set works from a variety of musical genres and eras.&quot; After six days, the petition had over 1,800 signatures and was featured in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

=== 2019 ===

==== Question duplication ====
In June, Paper 3 of the Mathematics GCSE (Higher Tier, 1MA1/03) appeared to contain an exam question which was published in an AQA (another British exam board) Further Mathematics textbook. The exam question had the same diagram, values and answer as the question in the textbook. Pearson Edexcel said that they were investigating how this might have happened.

====Exam difficulty concerns from students====
After students sat the Paper 2 of the new specification Mathematics A-Level (9MA0), many students complained online expressing that the difficulty of the exam was too high and unlike anything seen in past papers. One online petition to lower grade boundaries was signed by thousands of users. Before results day, Pearson Edexcel released a video addressing students about the difficulty concerns and mentioned that independent experts did confirm that the exam was &quot;fair and valid&quot;. They acknowledged the first two questions of the exam were more difficult than anticipated, and also claimed that they would make &quot;small adjustments&quot; to &quot;improve the experience&quot; of the exam for future students.

==== Leak ====
Further controversy ensued after the Paper 3 of the new specification Mathematics A-Level (9MA0/3H – sat 14 June), appeared to have been accessed by someone who, late in the night before the exam sitting, posted on Twitter that they would sell a copy of the exam paper for £70. Pearson Edexcel launched an investigation after becoming aware that some scribbled out images of the exam paper were circulated online prior the exam sitting, and found one centre (out of thirty-eight possible suspect centres in one geographic location), who were visited at a very short notice, to have committed a serious and &quot;possibly criminally motivated&quot; security breach of the A-Level maths paper.

Students expressed frustration about the incident; BBC News reported that students believed the incident could have the potential to affect their results. Pearson Edexcel stated that they have &quot;well-established processes to ensure fair and accurate results&quot; and that &quot;grade boundaries will not be affected&quot;. On 17 June Edexcel stated that the compromised questions could be removed from the overall assessment, as well as undertaking additional statistical analysis to identify irregular result patterns for particular centres or students.

About 60,000 students were affected in this incident. Two men aged 29 and 32 were arrested on 24 June on suspicion of theft. The men were released under investigation while inquiries continued. Ahead of results day, it was revealed that 78 students who were suspected of being at an advantage from malpractice would have their results withheld. This is the largest number of candidates to be withheld results from a single malpractice incident. No news report on the charge or conviction status after the arrest went to the press.

==== Extremely low A-level mathematics grade boundaries ====
After a leak of the A-Level Grade Boundaries ahead of results day, it emerged that in order to pass the new specification Mathematics A-Level (9MA0), candidates needed to score 14% (43 marks out of 300) to pass. OCR (another British exam board) also had similarly low grade boundaries. After these extremely low grade boundaries added flavour to many news headlines, Ofqual said that they were confident the grade boundaries this year were &quot;sound&quot;, so shifted their focus onto the previous year&#x27;s grade boundaries for the new Mathematics A-Level for the 2,000 students who sat it after studying it for one year. Ofqual said &quot;We want to understand why the grade boundaries were so different between the two years.&quot;, and had called the significant shifts in boundaries &quot;unusual&quot;.

None of the exam boards decided to re-open the 2018 award, after being asked to look at them again by the regulator. This could potentially result in students who sat the new specification Mathematics A-Level (9MA0) in 2018 having their results changed.

<text>Três Corações () is a municipality in the south of Minas Gerais state in Brazil. As of 2020, the city population was estimated at 80,032, making it one of the largest cities in the south of Minas Gerais. The city is geographically located close to the circumcenter of the three largest metropolitan areas in Brazil (Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo), thus making it a strategic hub for commerce. Três Corações is internationally famous for being the birthplace of football legend Pelé.

==History==
By the year 1760, the Portuguese Tomé Martins da Costa had settled on the banks of the Verde River to explore gold. After some years he built a big farm and started the construction of the &quot;Santíssimos Corações de Jesus, Maria e José&quot; (Most Holy Hearts of Jesus, Mary and Joseph) chapel.

In 1764 the Minas Gerais governor, D. Luiz Lobo Diogo Silva, visited Tomé M. Costa and noticed some small houses nearby.

In 1790, Captain Domingos Dias de Barros, Tomé&#x27;s son in law, built a bigger chapel on the site where the old one stood. It was opened to the public of Três Corações do Rio Verde and the Três Sacratíssimos Corações parish in 1832.

Três Corações do Rio Verde became part of the Minas Gerais Province in 1873, after the President of the province sanctioned laws establishing that the territory was part of its civil parish.

The town continued to develop civically after Emperor Pedro II and the imperial family visited it in 1884, for the inaugural of the Minas &amp; Rio railroad. The railroad connected the town to Cruzeiro, a town in São Paulo Province. Three months following the emperor&#x27;s visit, the town was emancipated and became categorized as a city.

Though formally known as Três Corações do Rio Verde, on September 7, 1923, the city became known as Três Corações.

The village has been known as Três Corações (&quot;Three Hearts&quot; in Portuguese) because of the name of the chapel (hearts of Jesus, Mary and Joseph).

That is the political and official history. There are two other versions as to the origin of the city&#x27;s name. One is that the path through which the river flows around the city forms the shape of three hearts. The other, more poetic version, tells the story of three cowboys, who while passing through the town from Goias, came upon three women, Jacyra, Jussara, and Moema. The women captured their attention, and the cowboys fell in love with them.

The municipality is watered by the following rivers: Verde, Peixe, Palmela, Lambari, besides several streams. The great reservoir of Furnas is located to the northwest at a distance of about 40 km. The important interstate highway, the BR 381 (Rodovia Fernão Dias) is located at a distance of 8 km.

There are light industries producing toys, highway signs, fertilizers, leather, milk products, steel wheels for cars, aluminum wheels, copper wires, and animal food among others.

==University==
The city has one university maintained by local authorities: Universidade Vale do Rio Verde (UNINCOR), which offers courses in several areas, including dentistry.

==Notable people==
Três Corações is the birthplace of football legend Pelé. Among other things there is a statue prominently placed in a plaza near downtown and a street, Rua Edson Arantes do Nascimento, named in his honour (the street was given Pelé&#x27;s full birth name).

Also Carlos Luz, the 19th president of Brazil and so far the shortest-serving one having held the office only for two days in 1955 before he was ousted by a military coup, was born in Três Corações.

<text>NOVA Entertainment is an Australian entertainment company that operates commercial radio networks (and associated digital brands) in metropolitan and regional areas of Australia. 

NOVA Entertainment is owned by Lachlan Murdoch&#x27;s Illyria Pty Ltd which purchased the remaining 50% it did not own from Daily Mail and General Trust in September 2012.

==History==
Nova Entertainment was formed in early 1996 under the name DMG Radio Australia, followed later in the year with the A$46M acquisition of 85% of the Broadcast Media group of regional stations. This was shortly followed by FIVEaa on 26 September 1996. The founding Chairman and CEO were Charlie Cox and Paul Thompson respectively. 

In September 2004, DMG Radio Australia sold most of its regional radio stations to Macquarie Bank, keeping only Hot 91 Sunshine Coast (later sold in early 2005) and Star 104.5 in Gosford.

On Monday 21 May 2012, after poor ratings, 91.5 FM Melbourne and 95.3 FM Sydney were rebranded again to [smoothfm with a new smooth, easy listening format to aim for women aged 35+.

In December 2013, DMG Radio Australia launched a 24-hour Australian pay television music channel, Smooth available via Foxtel satellite and cable services. The pay television music channel extends from the smoothfm radio brand. It was shut down on 30 June 2020.

In February 2014, DMG Radio Australia rebranded under the name Nova Entertainment to reflect the company&#x27;s increasingly diversified interests in radio and the media and entertainment industries. The new company name has been developed to encapsulate both the pride and heritage of the company’s original and successful FM launch brand, Nova, with its recent evolution into the broader media and entertainment space.

<doc id="584009" wikidata="Q520090" url="?curid=584009" title="Muhammad II of Khwarazm">
<text>&#x27;Alā&#x27; al-Din Muhammad (Persian: علاءالدین محمد خوارزمشاه; full name: &quot;Ala ad-Dunya wa ad-Din Abul-Fath Muhammad Sanjar ibn Tekish&quot;) was the Shah of the Khwarazmian Empire from 3 August 1200 to 11 January 1221. His ancestor was Anushtegin Gharchai, a Turkic Ghulam who eventually became a viceroy of a small province named Khwarazm. He was subjected to the Mongol conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire, which resulted in the utter destruction of his empire.

==Reign==
After his father Tekish died, Muhammad succeeded him. Right after his accession, however, his domains were invaded by the two Ghurid brothers Ghiyath al-Din Ghori and Mu&#x27;izz al-Din. Within weeks, the two brothers had moved their armies westwards into Khorasan. Once they had captured Nishapur, Mu&#x27;izz al-Din was sent on an expedition towards Ray, but he let his troops get out of control and got little further than Gurgan, earning criticism from Ghiyath which led to the only reported quarrel between the brothers.

Ghiyath died at Herat in 1203 after months of illness. Muhammad II used this opportunity to invade the domains of the Ghurid Empire, and besieged Herat. Mu&#x27;izz, however, managed to repel him from Herat and then pursued him to Khwarazm, besieging Gurganj, his capital. Muhammad desperately requested aid from the Kara-Khitan Khanate, who sent an army to aid Muhammad. Mu&#x27;izz, because of the pressure from the Kara-Khitans, was forced to relieve the siege and retreat. However, on his way to his domains in Ghur, he was defeated in Battle of Andkhud in 1204. Mu&#x27;izz al-Din was later assassinated in 1206, throwing the Ghurid Empire into a civil war. During the civil war, Ghiyath al-Din Mahmud managed to emerge victorious.

However, Ghiyath&#x27;s Turkic general Taj al-Din Yildiz seized Ghazni from the Ghurid rulers of Bamiyan, but shortly recognized the authority of Ghiyath. Ghiyath, not glad about Tajuddin controlling Ghazni, and not daring to leave Ghur unprotected, requested help from the Muhammad II. Muhammad, however, instead invaded the domains of Ghiyath, capturing Balkh and Tirmidh. However, during his invasion he was captured by the Kara-Khitan Khanate. Thirteen months later, Muhammad was freed from captivity, and once again invaded the domains of Ghiyath, and captured Herat. Muhammad then invaded the Ghurid heartland of Ghur, and captured Ghiyath. Ghiyath then agreed to recognize Muhammad&#x27;s authority.
Muhammad II then captured Samarkand in 1207 from the Kara Khitay, Tabaristan in 1210 from Bavandids and Transoxiana from Western Karakhanids. He pursued expansionist policy and conquered Tashkent and Fergana from Western Karakhanids and regions of Makran and Balochistan from Ghurids and Atabegs of Azerbaijan become his vassals in 1211. He finally destroyed Western Karakhanids in 1212 and Ghurids in 1215 annexing with their remainder territories. During 1212 the city of Samarkand revolted killing 8,000–10,000 Khwarazmians living there. Muhammad, in retaliation, sacked the city and executed 10,000 citizens of Samarkand.

By 1217, he had conquered all the lands from the river Jaxartes to the Persian Gulf. He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the caliph in Baghdad. When the caliph an-Nasir rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad gathered an army and marched towards Baghdad to depose an-Nasir. However, when crossing the Zagros Mountains, the shah&#x27;s army was caught in a blizzard. Thousands of warriors died. With the army decimated, the generals had no choice but to return home.

==Fall==

In 1218, a small contingent of Mongols crossed borders in pursuit of an escaped enemy general. Upon successfully retrieving him, Genghis Khan made contact with the Shah. Having only recently conquered two-thirds of the Jin dynasty and capturing Beijing, Genghis was looking to open trade relations, but having heard exaggerated reports of the Mongols, the Shah believed this gesture was only a ploy to invade &quot;his&quot; land. Genghis sent emissaries to Khwarazm (reports vary – one stating a group of 100 Muslim merchants with a single Mongol leading them, others state 450) to emphasize his hope for a trade road. The Shah, in turn, had one of his governors (Inalchuq, his uncle) openly accuse the party of spying, their rich goods were seized and the party was arrested. 

Trying to maintain diplomacy, Genghis sent an envoy of three men to the Shah, to give him a chance to disclaim all knowledge of the governor&#x27;s actions and hand him over to the Mongols for punishment. The shah executed the envoy (again, some sources claim one man was executed, some claim all three were), and then immediately had the Mongol merchant party (Muslim and Mongol alike) put to death and their goods seized. These events led Genghis to retaliate with a force of 100,000 to 150,000 men that crossed the Jaxartes in 1219 and sacked the cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Otrar and others. Muhammad&#x27;s capital city, Urgench, followed soon after.

Ala ad-Din Muhammad fled and sought refuge in Khorasan, and later died of pleurisy on an island in the Caspian Sea near the port of Abaskun some weeks later.

<doc id="584014" wikidata="Q1365572" url="?curid=584014" title="Steamboat Bill, Jr.">
<text>Steamboat Bill, Jr. is a 1928 silent comedy film starring Buster Keaton. Released by United Artists, the film is the final product of Keaton&#x27;s independent production team and set of gag writers.

The film was not a box-office success and became the last picture Keaton made for United Artists. Keaton ended up moving to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he made one last film in his trademark style, &quot;The Cameraman,&quot; and &quot;Spite Marriage,&quot; before his creative control was taken away by the studio.

Charles Reisner directed the film, and the credited story writer was Carl Harbaugh. The film, named after Arthur Collins&#x27;s popular 1911 recording of the 1910 song &quot;Steamboat Bill,&quot; also featured Ernest Torrence, Marion Byron, and Tom Lewis. The film is known for what may be Keaton&#x27;s most famous film stunt: The facade of a house falls around him while he stands in the precise location of an open window to avoid being flattened.

In 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. The copyright of the film expired in 1956.

==Plot==

William &quot;Steamboat Bill&quot; Canfield is the owner and captain of a paddle steamer, the &quot;Stonewall Jackson,&quot; that has seen better days. &quot;The King,&quot; a new steamer owned by the rich J.J. King, threatens to steal his customers. Canfield receives a telegram saying his son is arriving on the 10 am train, having finished his studies in Boston. Canfield has not seen him for many years.

King&#x27;s daughter Kitty arrives home from college to visit him.

Canfield meets Bill Jr. at the train station, but is deeply disappointed with his slight, awkward son, who is wearing a foppish beret and has a pencil moustache and a ukulele. Canfield sends him to the barber to have the moustache removed, and there the young man bumps into Kitty, whom he knows from college.

Both Canfield and King are determined to break up the developing relationship between Bill Jr. and Kitty, but Bill Jr. slips off and boards the &quot;King&quot; at night. Canfield sees Bill Jr.&#x27;s clumsy and rebellious effort and buys him a ticket back to Boston. Kitty is angry at him for planning to leave and snubs him on the street.

When Canfield&#x27;s ship is condemned as unsafe, he accuses King of orchestrating it. He assaults his enemy and is put in jail, prompting the son to tear up his train ticket. Bill Jr. makes a clumsy attempt to help his father escape, but ends up being knocked out by the sheriff and sent to the hospital.

A cyclone hits, demolishing buildings and endangering the ships. The hospital walls are torn away, leaving Bill Jr. exposed. As he makes his way through the town, a building front falls all around him as an unbroken facade, but Bill Jr. is untouched due to a fortunately placed open window. The jail is knocked off its foundations and starts to sink, with Canfield trapped inside. Bill Jr. rescues Kitty, Canfield, and King. Then he jumps into the water and comes back towing a minister in a lifebelt.

==Production==

The original idea for the film came from Charlie Chaplin collaborator Charles Reisner, who was the director. Keaton, who had directed or co-directed many of his earlier films, was an uncredited co-director on this project.In June 1927, he traveled to Sacramento, California, and spent over $100,000 building sets, including a pier. Original plans called for an ending with a flood sequence, but due to the devastating 1927 Mississippi River Flood, producer Joseph Schenck forced him to cut the arrangement. Keaton also spent an additional $25,000 for the cyclone scene, which included breakaway street sets and six powerful Liberty-motor wind machines. The cyclone scene cost one-third of the film&#x27;s entire budget, estimated at between $300,000 and $404,282. Keaton, who planned and performed his own stunts himself, was suspended on a cable from a crane, which hurled him from place to place as if airborne.

Shooting began on July 15, 1927, in Sacramento. Production was delayed when Keaton broke his nose in a baseball game.
The film includes his most famous stunt: an entire building facade falling all around him. An open attic window fits neatly around Keaton&#x27;s body as the structure falls, saving him from injury. He had performed a similar, though less elaborate, stunt in his earlier short films &quot;Back Stage&quot; (1919) and &quot;One Week&quot; (1920). He used a genuine, two-ton building facade and no trickery. The mark on the ground showing Keaton exactly where to stand to avoid being crushed was a nail. It has been claimed that if he had stood just inches off the correct spot, he would have been seriously injured or killed. His third wife, Eleanor, suggested that he took such risks due to despair over financial problems, his failing first marriage, the imminent loss of his filmmaking independence, and recklessness due to his worsening alcohol abuse at the time. Evidence that Keaton was suicidal is scant—he was known throughout his career for performing dangerous stunts independent of any difficulties in his personal life, including a fall from a railroad water tower tube in 1924&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; in which his neck was fractured. He later said, &quot;I was mad at the time, or I would never have done the thing.&quot; He also said that filming the shot was one of his greatest thrills.

It is one of the few Keaton films to reference his fame. At the time of filming, he had stopped wearing his trademark pork pie hat with a short flat crown. During an early scene in which his character tries on a series of hats (something that was copied several times in other films), a clothing salesman briefly puts the trademark cap on his head, but he quickly rejects it, tossing it away.

At the end of shooting, Schenck announced the dissolution of Buster Keaton Productions.

==Reception==
&quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; was a box office failure and received mixed reviews upon its release. &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;a pip of a comedy&quot; and &quot;one of Keaton&#x27;s best.&quot; The reviewer from &quot;The Film Spectator&quot; appointed it &quot;as perhaps the best comedy of the year thus far&quot; and advised, &quot;exhibitors should go after it.&quot; A less enthusiastic review from &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; stated, &quot;there are many situations all the way through that cause laughs&quot; while noting that &quot;the plot is nonsensical.&quot; Mordaunt Hall of the &quot;New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;gloomy comedy&quot; and a &quot;sorry affair.&quot;

Over the years, &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; has become regarded as a masterpiece of its era. On Rotten Tomatoes 96% of critics have given the film a positive rating based on 52 reviews, with an average score of 9.00/10. The film was included in the book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.&quot;

==Legacy==
The film likely inspired the title of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; (1928), which was released six months later and is considered the debut of Mickey Mouse. In it, Mickey whistles a melody from the film&#x27;s opening title.

The famous falling house stunt has been re-created several times on film and television (although with lighter materials and more contemporary safety measures in place) including the 1975 The Goodies episode &quot;The Movies,&quot; the 1991 &quot;MacGyver&quot; episode &quot;Deadly Silents,&quot; Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Project A Part II,&quot; the 2004 &quot;Arrested Development&quot; episode &quot;The One Where They Build a House&quot; (performed by the show&#x27;s character named Buster), Al Yankovic&#x27;s music video Amish Paradise (cross-referencing Peter Weir&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;Witness&quot;), the 2006 comedy film &quot;Jackass Number Two,&quot; an Australian home insurance TV advertisement in 2021, and episode 7 in the first season of &quot;Lucha Underground,&quot; with a ladder.

&quot;Deadpan,&quot; a 1997 work by English film artist and director Steve McQueen, was also inspired by &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; McQueen stands in Keaton&#x27;s place as a house facade falls over him. This film was shot from multiple angles, and the scene repeats over and over again while McQueen stands seemingly unaffected.

George Miller&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; references the scene where crates are blown all over Buster during the cyclone when Jack Nicholson gets debris (including boxes) blown over him in the windstorm sequence towards the end. The shot from the Keaton film is also seen in one of the multiple TVs in the media room in the final scene.

<doc id="584015" wikidata="Q8048406" url="?curid=584015" title="Yang Huanming">
<text>Yang Huanming (; born 6 October 1952) is a Chinese biologist, businessman and one of China&#x27;s leading genetics researchers. He is Chairman and co-founder of the Beijing Genomics Institute, formerly of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was elected as member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2007, a foreign academician of Indian National Science Academy in 2009, a member of the German National Academy of Sciences in 2012, and foreign associate of the US National Academy of Science in 2014.

==Early life and education==
Yang was born on 6 October 1952, near Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. He received his B.Sc from Hangzhou University (now part of Zhejiang University) in 1978, followed by a master&#x27;s degree in biology in 1982 from the Nanjing Railroad Medical Institute (now Southeast University). Yang earned his Ph.D in 1988 from the Institute of Medical Genetics of University of Copenhagen, Denmark. He then completed his post-doctoral training in Europe (at CIML, INSERM/CNRS, Marseille, France, 1988–90) and the United States (at Harvard Medical School and UCLA, 1990–94).

==Research==
Yang&#x27;s work include the mapping and cloning of human genes, the sequencing and analysis of the human genome, human genome diversity and evolution, and the ethical, legal, and social issues related to genome research. The study of Yang and his collaborators at the Beijing Genomics Institute on the rice genome made the cover of the April 5, 2002, issue of Science magazine. Yang led a 2001 UNESCO sponsored symposium held in Hangzhou on research ethics that focused on some questionable research projects by foreign researchers in Anhui Province and on strengthening the protection of human research subjects in China. With his interest in bioethics, Yang was the only Chinese appointee on International Research Panel of President Obama&#x27;s Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical issues in 2011 investigating the 1940s Guatemala syphilis experiment. From 1998 to 2001 he was member of UNESCO&#x27;s International Bioethics Committee (UNESCO-IBC).

A long running advocate of data sharing, during his participation on the UNESCO-IBC he issued a statement stressing the need for free access to DNA sequences and protested against the monopolization of scientific advances by private firms such as Celera. UNESCO subsequently issuing a similar statement which was then endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations partly through his persistent efforts.

Yang led China&#x27;s participation in the international Human Genome Project. Yang is a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He was also Coordinator-in-China of the International HapMap Consortium and Chief Coordinator of the Chinese Hybrid Rice Genome Consortium. Yang was Secretary-General of the Chinese Human Genome Project (CHGP), Secretary-General of the Human Genome Diversity Committee, and Secretary-General of the Committee of Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues (ELSI), CHGP.

Yang is also a member of Collegium International, an organization of leaders with political, scientific, and ethical expertise whose goal is to provide new approaches in overcoming the obstacles in the way of a peaceful, socially just and an economically sustainable world.

==Beijing Genomics Institute==

Yang is co-Founder, Director and Chairman of an institute that has a dual public-private nature since it first established with the help of Wenzhou business people as the Huada Genomics Research Institute (or Beijing Genomics Institute in English) and then later received Chinese government support as the Beijing Genomics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Unusual for when it was an institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 80% of the then 500 research positions at the BGI laboratories in Beijing and Hangzhou were supported through competitive grants from both Chinese and foreign sources. In 2007 BGI split from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and moved their headquarters to Shenzhen as the first citizen-managed, non-profit research institution in China.

<doc id="584016" wikidata="Q471536" url="?curid=584016" title="German submarine U-853">
<text>German submarine &quot;U-853&quot; was a Type IXC/40 U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. Her keel was laid down on 21 August 1942 by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen. She was commissioned on 25 June 1943 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Helmut Sommer in command. &quot;U-853&quot; saw action during the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. She conducted three patrols, sinking two ships totalling and 430 tons.

On her final patrol, &quot;U-853&quot; was sent to harass United States coastal shipping. She destroyed near Portland, Maine. Just days before Germany&#x27;s surrender, &quot;U-853&quot; torpedoed and sank the collier &quot;Black Point&quot; during the Battle of Point Judith. The day before Germany surrendered, American warships quickly found &quot;U-853&quot; and sank her east of Block Island, Rhode Island, resulting in the loss of her entire crew.

The submerged &quot;U-853&quot; rests in of water and the site is a popular deep sea diving site. 

==Design==
German Type IXC/40 submarines were slightly larger than the original Type IXCs. &quot;U-853&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boat had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN M 9 V 40/46 supercharged four-stroke, nine-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/34 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-853&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and two at the stern), 22 torpedoes, one SK C/32 naval gun, 180 rounds, and a SK C/30 as well as a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of forty-eight.

==Armament==
===FLAK weaponry===
&quot;U-853&quot; was armed with a single 3.7 cm Flakzwilling M43U gun on the LM 42U mount. The LM 42U mount was the most common mount used with the 3.7 cm Flak M42U. The 3.7 cm Flak M42U was the marine version of the 3.7 cm Flak used by the Kriegsmarine on Type VII and Type IX U-boats. &quot;U-853&quot; had two 2cm Flak C38 in a M 43U &quot;Zwilling&quot; mount with short folding shield mounted on the upper &quot;Wintergarten&quot;. The M 43U mount was used on a number of U-boats (, , , , , , , , , , and ).

==Service history==
&quot;U-853&quot; was built by DeSchiMAG AG Weser of Bremen. Ordered on 5 June 1941, her keel was laid on 21 August 1942 and she was commissioned on 25 June 1943.

The Germans nicknamed the U-boat &quot;der Seiltänzer&quot; (&quot;the Tightrope Walker&quot;), and her crew painted an emblem of a yellow shield with a red horse on her sail.

===First patrol===
On her first war patrol from May to June 1944, &quot;U-853&quot; was assigned to weather-watching duty under the command of &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Helmut Sommer. German intelligence believed that weather conditions in the Atlantic could be used to help predict the timing of an Allied invasion of Europe. On 25 May 1944 &quot;U-853&quot; spotted , loaded with American troops and supplies. The U-boat submerged to attack, but was outrun by the much larger and faster ship. As she surfaced in &quot;Queen Mary&#x27;s&quot; wake &quot;U-853&quot; was attacked by Fairey Swordfish aircraft from British merchant aircraft carriers and . The U-boat took no significant damage and returned fire, hitting all three aircraft. The planes were able to return to their carrier, but after recovery one was deemed a total loss and jettisoned.

The escort carrier had been hunting weather boats for nearly a month and had already sunk and . Intercepted radio transmissions led &quot;Croatan&quot; and six destroyers to search for &quot;U-853&quot;. The &quot;U-853&quot; proved so elusive that &quot;Croatan&quot;&#x27;s crew nicknamed their prey &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; After ten days of hunting, on 17 June Huff-Duff (HF/DF, high frequency direction finding) picked up a weather report from &quot;U-853&quot; only away. Within minutes two FM-1 Wildcat fighters strafed the submarine, killing 2 men and wounding 12 others. Sommer suffered 28 shrapnel and bullet wounds yet still managed to give the order to submerge. In all likelihood Sommer saved his submarine from being destroyed by allied bombers.

Three weeks of pursuit from 25 May until 17 June placed an enormous strain on &quot;U-853&quot;″s crew. Twenty-three-year-old &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Helmut Frömsdorf took command of the boat on 18 June (his first command) and returned to Lorient in northwest France. Sommer and a large number of the crew was declared unfit for duty. On 10 July Sommer was formally relieved by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Otto Wermuth.

===Second patrol===
The boat remained in port until 27 August. Decorated veteran &quot;Korvettenkapitän&quot; Günter Kuhnke, Commander of the 10th U-boat Flotilla, took command for her second patrol.
&quot;U-853&quot; operated this time in the Western Approaches off the British Isles, but in a period of seven weeks scored no successes. On completion she did not return to Lorient, but continued to Flensburg, Germany, arriving 14 October.
Kuhnke assumed command of the 33rd U-boat Flotilla upon arriving at Flensburg. He relinquished command of &quot;U-853&quot; back to Frömsdorf, who took the U-boat on her third and final patrol. Before departure &quot;U-853&quot; was fitted with a &quot;Schnorchel&quot;, a retractable air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while running her diesel engines. The &quot;Schnorchel&quot; reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.

===Last patrol===
On 23 February 1945 Germany sent &quot;U-853&quot; on her third war patrol to harass US coastal shipping. Under the command of &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Helmut Frömsdorf, &quot;U-853&quot; did not sink any targets during the first weeks of her patrol. Her crossing of the Atlantic was slow because she used her &quot;Schnorchel&quot; to remain submerged to avoid being spotted by Allied aircraft. On 1 April 1945 &quot;U-853&quot; was ordered to the Gulf of Maine.

On 23 April she fatally torpedoed near Portland, Maine.
&quot;Eagle 56&quot;, a World War I-era patrol boat, was towing targets for a United States Navy dive-bomber training exercise off Cape Elizabeth when she exploded amidships and sank. Only 13 of the 67 crew survived. That same day dropped nine depth charges on a suspected submarine. The next day made sonar contact and attacked &quot;U-853&quot;, but failed to destroy her.

Although several survivors claimed to have seen a submarine sail with yellow and red insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the PE-56 sinking to a boiler explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 to acknowledge that the sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.

===Battle of Point Judith===

On 5 May 1945, Reichspräsident of Nazi Germany Karl Dönitz ordered all U-boats to cease offensive operations and return to their bases. &quot;U-853&quot; was lying in wait off Point Judith, Rhode Island, at the time. According to the US Coast Guard, &quot;U-853&quot; either did not receive that order or, less likely, ignored it. Soon after, her torpedo blew off the stern of &quot;Black Point&quot;, a collier underway from New York to Boston. Within 15 minutes &quot;Black Point&quot; had sunk in of water less than south of Point Judith. She was the last US-flagged merchant ship lost in World War II. Twelve men died and 34 crew members were rescued. One of the rescuing ships, Yugoslav freighter &quot;Kamen&quot;, sent a report of the torpedoing to authorities. The US Navy organized a &quot;hunter-killer&quot; group that included four American warships: , , , and .

The group discovered &quot;U-853&quot; bottomed in , and dropped depth charges and hedgehogs during a 16-hour attack. At first, the U-boat attempted to flee, then tried to hide by lying still. Both times it was found by sonar. On the morning of 6 May 1945 two K-Class blimps from Lakehurst, New Jersey, K-16 and K-58, joined the attack, locating oil slicks and marking suspected locations with smoke and dye markers. K-16 also attacked with 7.2-inch rocket bombs. Numerous depth charge and hedgehog attacks from &quot;Atherton&quot; and &quot;Moberly&quot; resulted in planking, life rafts, a chart tabletop, clothing, and an officer&#x27;s cap floating to the surface. &quot;U-853&quot; was one of the last U-boats sunk during World War II and the last to be sunk in US waters. ( was sunk the same day in the North Atlantic.) &quot;Atherton&quot; and &quot;Moberly&quot; received joint credit for the kill.

==Legacy==
The submarine&#x27;s two propellers were on display for many years at the Inn at Castle Hill in Newport and are now in the custody of the United States Naval War College Museum at the Newport Naval Station.

The USS &quot;Atherton&quot; was transferred to Japan and served as part of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force until 1975 when she was returned to the United States. She was given to the Philippines in 1978 and served as BRP Rajah Humabon (PS-11) with the Philippine Navy until 2018.

Interest has been expressed in returning &quot;Atherton&quot; to the United States so she can be restored to her World War II appearance and be opened to the public. &quot;Rajah Humabon&quot; was decommissioned on 15 March 2018 and is planned to be part of the Philippine Navy museum in Sangley Point.

==Wreck==

&quot;U-853&quot; lies east of Block Island in of water. The US Coast Guard pinpoints the location of the wreck at . Most of the 55 crew member bodies remain within the hull, which is a war grave. It is one of the more popular dive sites in Southern New England. The hull has depth charge blast holes: one forward of the conning tower at the radio room and another in the starboard side of the engine room. Entering the wreck is dangerous due to debris, sharp metal edges, and confined spaces.

On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers attempted to enter the wreck to recover the captain&#x27;s safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers first visited the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island.

As of 1998 at least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage. Stephen Hardick died in 2005 while filming the U-boat. He surfaced unconscious and could not be revived. Hardick, age 60, died as the result of saltwater drowning associated with poor health according to the Rhode Island Medical Examiner&#x27;s office.

On October 26, 2022, a live depth charge was found near the wreckage by fishermen based out of Rhode Island. The depth charge contained 267 pounds of TNT which was set out to destroy the German U-boat.

<doc id="584022" wikidata="Q1562510" url="?curid=584022" title="Quartodecimanism">
<text>Quartodecimanism (from the Vulgate Latin &quot;quarta decima&quot; in Leviticus 23:5, meaning fourteenth) is the name given to the practice of commemorating the death of Christ on the day of Passover, the 14th of Nisan according to biblical dating, on whatever day of the week it occurs. The Quartodeciman controversy in the Church was the question of whether to celebrate Easter on Sunday (the first day of the week), or Passover (the time of sacrifice of the Passover lamb).

== History ==

=== Early Christianity ===

There is scholarly disagreement on which tradition is the original. Some scholars believe that Sunday observance began before Quartodecimanism, while others have argued that Quartodecimanism was original. The Quartodecimans claimed that their traditions are inherited from the Apostles John and Philip, while western churches claimed that their views of Easter have been inherited from Paul and Peter. Quartodecimanism was popular in Asia Minor, Jerusalem and Syria, however it was rejected by churches in other regions. Polycarp, like other Asiatics, kept Easter on the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan. According to Eusebius, Polycarp claimed that his practice came from the apostle John. Some of the Montanists were also Quartodeciman. Montanism brought Quartodeciman practices to the west, for example Blastus was a Roman Montanist who was also a Quartodeciman. It is unclear if the Ebionites were Quartodeciman, however they probably observed Passover in addition to other Jewish festivals.

Melito of Sardis, Sagar of Laodicea, Papirius of Smyrna, perhaps Apollinaris of Laodicea and Polycrates of Ephesus held Quartodeciman views. The Didascalia likely drew from a Quartodeciman source. Some Novatians that spread into the east were Quartodecimans.

By the 4th century the influence of Quartodecimans declined; later they would even be persecuted.

The opponents of Quartodecimanism argued that it is a form of Judaizing.

=== Roman Schism ===
Blastus, a Montanist caused a schism in Rome about the date of Easter, argued that Christians must keep Easter at the same time commanded in Exodus for the Passover and gained a following in Rome, and was then accused of Judaizing by the Church. This schism in Rome likely influenced the hostility of Pope Victor I against Quartodecimanism. 

=== Quartodeciman controversy ===
The Quartodeciman controversy arose because Christians in Jerusalem and Asia Minor observed Passover on the 14th of the first month (Nisan), regardless of the day of the week on which it occurred, while the churches in and around Rome celebrated Easter on the Sunday following first Full Moon following the vernal equinox, calling it &quot;the day of the resurrection of our Saviour&quot;. The difference became an ecclesiastical controversy when the practice was condemned by synods of bishops.

==== Background ====
Of the disputes over the date when the Lord&#x27;s Supper (Eucharist) should be celebrated, disputes known as Paschal/Easter controversies, the quartodeciman is the first recorded.

In the mid–2nd century, the practice in Asia Minor was for the pre-Paschal fast to end with a feast held on the 14th day of Nisan, when the barley was ripe after the new moon near the Jewish lunar month of Nisan (no matter the day of the week on which it occurred), the date on which the Passover sacrifice had been offered when the Second Temple stood, and &quot;the day when the people put away the leaven&quot;. Those who observed this practice were called &quot;quartodecimani&quot;, Latin for &quot;fourteenthers&quot;, because of holding their celebration on the 14th day of Nisan.

The practice had been followed by Polycarp, who was a disciple of John the Apostle and bishop of Smyrna (c. 69 – c. 155) - one of the seven churches of Asia, and by Melito of Sardis (d. c. 180). Irenaeus says that Polycarp visited Rome when Anicetus was its bishop (c. 68–153), and among the topics discussed was this divergence of custom, with Rome celebrating the Easter always on Sunday. Irenaeus noted:

But neither considered that the disagreement required them to break off communion and initiate a schism. Indeed, &quot;Anicetus conceded the administration of the Eucharist in the church to Polycarp, manifestly as a mark of respect. And they parted from each other in peace, both those who observed, and those who did not, maintaining the peace of the whole church.&quot;

Sozomen also wrote:
A modern source says that the discussion between Polycarp and Anicetus in Rome took place within the framework of a synod.

Thus the churches in Asia appealed to the Apostle John in support of their practice, while Sozomen wrote that the Roman custom (observed, according to Irenaeus, since at least the time of Bishop Xystus of 115–25) was believed to have been handed down by the Apostles Peter and Paul, and Eusebius states that in Judea and Egypt the Sunday observance was also believed to have originated with the Apostles.

===Condemnatory synods===
According to Eusebius, in the last decade of the 2nd century a number of synods were convened to deal with the controversy, ruling unanimously that the celebration of Easter should be observed and be exclusively on Sunday.
These synods were held in Palestine, Pontus and Osrhoene in the east, and in Rome and Gaul in the west. The council in Rome, presided over by its bishop Victor, took place in 193 and sent a letter about the matter to Polycrates of Ephesus and the churches of the Roman province of Asia. Within the same year, Polycrates presided over a council at Ephesus attended by several bishops throughout that province, which rejected Victor&#x27;s authority and kept the province&#x27;s paschal tradition.

Polycrates emphatically stated that he was following the tradition passed down to him:

===Excommunication===
On receiving the negative response of Polycrates, Victor attempted to cut off Polycrates and the others who took this stance from the common unity, but reversed his decision after bishops who included Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, interceded, recommending that Victor follow the more peaceful attitude of his predecessors.
===Resolution===
In the short following chapter of the account by Eusebius, a chapter headed &quot;How All came to an Agreement respecting the Passover&quot;, he recounts that the Palestinian bishops Narcissus and Theophilus, together with the bishops of Tyre and Ptolemais, wrote a lengthy review of the tradition of Sunday celebration of Easter which believed &quot;had come to them in succession from the apostles&quot;, and concluded by saying:
Historically, there had been a debate about when quartodecimanism disappeared and in particular whether it disappeared before or after the first ecumenical council (Nicaea I) in 325. According to Mark DelCogliano, &quot;the older opinion persists&quot; but Duchesne&#x27;s opinion &quot;has gained widespread acceptance.&quot; According to DelCogliano, &quot;by the early 4th century all Christians were celebrating Easter on a Sunday. Accordingly, it was not the quartodeciman practice that Constantine sought to eliminate, but rather the so-called &#x27;Protopaschite&#x27; practice which calculated the paschal full moon according to the Jewish lunar calendar and not the Julian solar calendar&quot;.

As shown, for instance, by the Sardica paschal table, it was quite common at that time that the Jewish calendrical year started before and after the equinox according to Exodus 12:2 and Deuteronomy 16:1. In case the previous year had started after the equinox, two Passovers would be celebrated in the same solar year (the solar New Year was starting on March 21). Note: (The word month being Hebrew &quot;Chodesh&quot; which literally means New Moon which is referenced in Deuteronomy 16:1). Since the 3rd century this disorder of the Jewish calendar of the time was lamented by several Christian writers, who felt that the Jews were often using a wrong lunation as their Nisan month and advocated the introduction of an independent &quot;computus&quot; by the Christians.

In a letter to the bishops who had not been present, Emperor Constantine I said that it had been decided to adopt a uniform date, rejecting the custom of the Jews, who had crucified Jesus and whose practice often meant that two passovers were celebrated in the same solar year: (Even though there is a commandment to keep a second passover in Numbers 9:10-12 if found unclean to keep the first)
==Legacy==
It is not known how long the Nisan 14 practice lasted. The church historian Socrates of Constantinople knew of quartodecimans who were deprived of their churches by John Chrysostom, and harassed in unspecified ways by Nestorius, both bishops of Constantinople. This indicates that the Nisan 14 practice, or a practice that was called by the same name, lingered into the 4th century.

Because this was the first-recorded Paschal/Easter controversy, it has had a strong influence on the minds of some subsequent generations. Wilfrid, the 7th-century bishop of York in Northumbria, styled his opponents in the Paschal/Easter controversy of his day &quot;quartodecimans&quot;, though they celebrated Pascha (Easter) on Sunday. Many scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries thought that the dispute over Pascha (Easter) that was discussed at Nicaea was between the Nisan 14 practice and Sunday observance. According to one account, &quot;A final settlement of the dispute was one among the other reasons which led Constantine to summon the council at Nicaea in 325. At that time, the Syrians and Antiochenes were the solitary champions of the observance of the 14th day. The decision of the council was unanimous that Pascha (Easter) was to be kept on Sunday, and on the same Sunday throughout the world, and that &#x27;none hereafter should follow the blindness of the Jews. A new translation, published in 1999, of Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; suggests that this view is no longer widely accepted; its view is that the dispute at Nicaea was between two schools of Sunday observance: those who followed the traditional practice of relying on Jewish informants to determine the lunar month of the Nisan in which Passover would fall, and those who wished to set it using Christian computations using the spring equinox on the solar calendar. Laurent Cleenewerck suggests that the East-West schism could even be argued to have started with Victor&#x27;s attempt to excommunicate the Asian churches. Despite Victor&#x27;s failure to carry out his intent to excommunicate the Asian churches, many Catholic theologians point to this episode as evidence of papal primacy and authority in the early Church, citing the fact that none of the bishops challenged his right to excommunicate but rather questioned the wisdom and charity of doing so. From the Orthodox perspective, Victor had to relent in the end and we see that the Eastern Churches never grant him presidency over anything other than his own church, his own synod. Cleenewerck points out that Eusebius of Caesarea simply refers to Victor as one of the &quot;rulers of the Churches&quot;, not the ruler of a yet unknown or unformed &quot;universal Church&quot;. As the date of observance of the Resurrection of Christ as being on the Sunday day of the week rather than the 14th day of the month was not resolved by Papal authority it was only finally resolved by an Ecumenical Council. Epiphanius of Salamis even called Quartodecimanism a heresy.

The rejection of Bishop Anicetus&#x27; position on the quartodeciman by Polycarp, and later Polycrates&#x27; letter to Pope Victor I, has been used by Orthodox theologians as proof against the argument that the Churches in Asia Minor accepted the Primacy of the Bishop of Rome and the teaching of Papal supremacy.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Bible Students celebrate the Memorial of Christ&#x27;s death on Nisan 14, while the Living Church of God keeps the quartodeciman Passover on the evening beginning Nisan 14.

<text>GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework that links together a wide variety of media processing systems to complete complex workflows. For instance, GStreamer can be used to build a system that reads files in one format, processes them, and exports them in another. The formats and processes can be changed in a plug and play fashion.

GStreamer supports a wide variety of media-handling components, including simple audio playback, audio and video playback, recording, streaming and editing. The pipeline design serves as a base to create many types of multimedia applications such as video editors, transcoders, streaming media broadcasters and media players.

It is designed to work on a variety of operating systems, e.g. the BSDs, OpenSolaris, Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, Windows, OS/400.

GStreamer is free and open-source software subject to the terms of the LGPL-2.1-or-later and is being hosted at freedesktop.org.

==Distribution and adoption==
The GNOME desktop environment, a heavy user of GStreamer, has included GStreamer since GNOME version 2.2 and encourages GNOME and GTK applications to use it. Other projects also use or support it, such as the Phonon media framework and the Songbird media player. It is also used in the WebKit browser engine.

GStreamer also operates in embedded devices like the Jolla Phone, the Palm Pre, Tizen and the Nokia 770, N800, N810, N900 and N9 Internet Tablets running the Maemo operating system.

In addition to source code releases, the GStreamer project provides binary builds for Android, iOS, OSX and Windows.

The LIGO Laboratory make use of GStreamer to simulate and analyze gravitational wave data. The GStreamer interface is called GstLAL.
==Software architecture==


GStreamer is written in the C programming language with the type system based on GObject and the GLib 2.0 object model.

===Language bindings===
A library written in one programming language may be used in another language if bindings are written; GStreamer has a range of bindings for various languages such as Go, Python, Rust, Vala, C++, Perl, GNU Guile, C# and Ruby.

===Overview===
GStreamer processes media by connecting a number of processing &quot;elements&quot; into a &quot;pipeline&quot;. Each element is provided by a plug-in. Elements can be grouped into &quot;bins&quot;, which can be further aggregated, thus forming a hierarchical graph. This is an example of a filter graph.

Elements communicate by means of &quot;pads&quot;. A &quot;source pad&quot; on one element can be connected to a &quot;sink pad&quot; on another. When the pipeline is in the &quot;playing&quot; state, data &quot;buffers&quot; flow from the source pad to the sink pad. Pads negotiate the kind of data that will be sent using &quot;capabilities&quot;.

The diagram to the right could exemplify playing an MP3 file using GStreamer. The file source reads an MP3 file from a computer&#x27;s hard-drive and sends it to the MP3 decoder. The decoder decodes the file data and converts it into PCM samples which then pass to the sound-driver. The sound-driver sends the PCM sound samples to the computer&#x27;s speakers.

===Plug-ins===
GStreamer uses a plug-in architecture which makes the most of GStreamer&#x27;s functionality implemented as shared libraries. GStreamer&#x27;s base functionality contains functions for registering and loading plug-ins and for providing the fundamentals of all classes in the form of base classes. Plug-in libraries get dynamically loaded to support a wide spectrum of codecs, container formats, input/output drivers and effects.

Plug-ins can be installed semi-automatically when they are first needed. For that purpose distributions can register a backend that resolves feature-descriptions to package-names.

Since version 0.9, the plug-ins come grouped into three sets (named after the film &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;).

Individual distributions may further sub-classify these plug-ins: for example Ubuntu groups the &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; sets into the &quot;Universe&quot; or the &quot;Multiverse&quot; components.

In addition, there is a GStreamer FFmpeg plug-in (called &quot;gst-libav&quot; for historic reasons) that extends the number of supported media formats.

====Video acceleration====
There are various SIP blocks that can do the computations to decode certain video codecs, such as PureVideo, UVD, QuickSync Video, TI Ducati and more. Such needs to be supported by the device driver, which in turn provides one or multiple interfaces, like VDPAU, VAAPI, Distributed Codec Engine or DXVA to end-user software like MPlayer to access this hardware and offload computation to it.

* It is possible to use Video Coding Engine with GStreamer through the OpenMAX IL wrapper plugin . This is for example possible on the Raspberry Pi.
* The SIP core present on some Texas Instruments SoCs is also accessible through GStreamer: , , .
* VDPAU and VAAPI are supported with GNOME Videos &gt;= 2.28.0 and GStreamer &gt;= 0.10.26 since 2010
* Broadcom Crystal HD is supported

====Media formats====
The Good, Bad and Ugly GStreamer plugins mentioned earlier provide, alongside processing elements/filters of all kinds, support for a wide variety of file formats, protocols and multimedia codecs. In addition to those, support for more than a hundred compression formats (including MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.261, H.263, H.264, RealVideo, MP3, WMV, etc.) is transparently provided through the &quot;gst-libav&quot; plug-in.

==History and development==

===Early days===
Erik Walthinsen founded the GStreamer project in 1999. Many of its core design ideas came from a research project at the Oregon Graduate Institute. Wim Taymans joined the project soon thereafter and greatly expanded on many aspects of the system. Many other software developers have contributed since then.

The first major release was 0.1.0 which was announced on 11 January 2001. Not long after, GStreamer picked up its first commercial backer. Towards the end of January 2001, they hired Erik Walthinsen to develop methods for embedding GStreamer in smaller (cell phone-class) devices. Another RidgeRun employee, Brock A. Frazier, designed the GStreamer logo. RidgeRun later struggled financially and had to lay off its staff, including Erik Walthinsen. GStreamer progress was mostly unaffected.

The project released a series of major releases with 0.2.0 coming out in July 2001, 0.4.0 in September 2002, and 0.8.0 in March 2004. During that period the project also changed its versioning strategy and while the first releases were simply new versions, later on the middle number started signifying release series. This meant the project did release a string of 0.6.x and 0.8.x releases which was meant to stay binary compatible within those release series. Erik Walthinsen more or less left GStreamer development behind during this time, focusing on other ventures.

All release series, the project face difficulties. Every series is not very popular in the Linux community mostly because of stability issues and a serious lack of features compared to competing projects like Xine, MPlayer, and VLC. The project also suffers a lack of leadership as Wim Taymans, the project lead since Erik Walthinsen had left, had largely stopped participating.

===The 0.10 series===
In 2004, a new company was founded, Fluendo, which wanted to use GStreamer to write a streaming server Flumotion and also provide multimedia solutions for GStreamer. During this time, Fluendo hired most of the core developers including Wim Taymans and attracted the support of companies such as Nokia and Intel to bring GStreamer to a professional level and drive community adoption.

With Wim Taymans back at the helm, the core of GStreamer was redesigned and became what is the current 0.10.x series, which had its first release (0.10.0) in December 2005. It has maintained API and ABI compatibility since.

With a new stable core in place, GStreamer gained in popularity in 2006, being used by media players including Totem, Rhythmbox and Banshee with many more to follow. It was also adopted by corporations such as Nokia, Motorola, Texas Instruments, Freescale, Tandberg, and Intel.

In 2007, most of the core GStreamer developers left Fluendo, including GStreamer maintainer Wim Taymans who went on to co-found Collabora Multimedia together with other GStreamer veterans, while others joined Sun Microsystems, Oblong Industries, and Songbird.

Between June 2012 and August 2014, GStreamer 0.10 was also distributed by Collabora and Fluendo as a multiplatform SDK,&lt;ref name=&quot;patents and nonfree software distributed with the Collabora/Fluendo version of the SDK at gstreamer.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on the third-party gstreamer.com website (rather than gstreamer.freedesktop.org for the upstream community project). The goal was to provide application developers with a SDK that would be functionally identical on Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. The SDK initiative aimed to facilitate the commercial adoption of the GStreamer project, as it provided a standardized entry point to developing multimedia applications with GStreamer, without needing to build the entire platform by oneself. Users of the SDK also benefited from documentation , tutorials and instructions specific to that SDK.

===The 1.x series===
GStreamer 1.0 was released on September 24, 2012. The 1.x series is parallel installable to GStreamer 0.10 to ease the transition, and provides many architectural advantages over the 0.10 series. Generally speaking, GStreamer 1.0 brought significant improvements for:
* Embedded processors support, lower power consumption, offloading work to specialized hardware units (such as DSPs)
* Hardware accelerated video decoding/encoding using GPUs
* Zero-copy memory management (avoiding unnecessary roundtrips between the CPU and GPU) for better performance and lower power consumption
* Dynamic pipelines
* API and code cleanups

Beyond the technical improvements, the 1.x series is also defined by a new release versioning scheme. As the GStreamer roadmap explains, all 1.x.y versions carry a -1.0 API version suffix and have a stable API/ABI. The API/ABI can only be broken by a new major release series (i.e.: 2.x); however, there are currently no plans for a 2.0 release series. Until then, the new version numbering scheme can be used to predict the intended use of each release. The roadmap cites some examples:
* 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3... stable release and follow-up bug-fix releases
* 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3... pre-releases, development version leading up to 1.2.0
* 1.2.0, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3... stable release and follow-up bug-fix releases
* 1.3.0...
* 1.4.0...
* etc.

In March 2013, the GStreamer project maintainers issued a statement to clarify that the 0.10 series is no longer maintained. The statement reasserted the GStreamer project&#x27;s willingness to help application and plugin developers migrate to the new technology, and hinted that those for whom switching to the 1.x series was still considered impossible could seek assistance from various consulting companies.

1.2 added support for DASH adaptive streaming, JPEG 2000 images, VP9 and Daala video, and decoding-only support for WebP.

Version 1.14 was released on March 19, 2018, adding support for WebRTC, AV1, Nvidia NVDEC, and Secure Reliable Transport, among other changes.

Version 1.22 was released on January 23, 2023, adding improved support for AV1, in addition to support for HLS, DASH and Microsoft Smooth Streaming for adaptive bitrate streaming.

<doc id="584026" wikidata="Q1994847" url="?curid=584026" title="Res publica">
<text>, also spelled rēs pūblica to indicate vowel length, is a Latin phrase, loosely meaning &quot;public affair&quot;. It is the root of the &quot;republic&quot;, and &quot;commonwealth&quot; has traditionally been used as a synonym for it; however, translations vary widely according to the context. &quot;Res&quot; is a nominative singular Latin noun for a substantive or concrete thing—as opposed to &quot;spes&quot;, which means something unreal or ethereal—and &quot;publica&quot; is an attributive adjective meaning &quot;of or pertaining to the public, people&quot;, hence a literal translation is &quot;the public thing, affair&quot;, or &quot;the people&#x27;s thing, affair&quot;.

The Latin term &quot;res publica&quot; was incompatible with the idea of absolute power by any individual or group over the body of citizens. The most essential characteristic of a &quot;res publica&quot; was liberty (&quot;libertas&quot;), which meant freedom from the arbitrary control of another and the absence of a monarchical domination over the body politic, that was analogous to the absolute power of a master over a slave.

==In ancient Rome==
===Public property===
&quot;Res publica&quot; usually is something held in common by many people. For instance, a park or garden in the city of Rome could either be private property (&quot;res privata&quot;) or managed by the state, in which case it would be part of the &quot;res publica&quot;.

===State or commonwealth===
Taking everything together that is of public interest leads to the connotation that &quot;res publica&quot; in general equals &quot;the state&quot;. For Romans, the state equaled the Roman Empire and all its interests, so &quot;Res Publica&quot; may also refer to the &quot;Roman Empire&quot; as a whole, regardless of whether it was governed as a &quot;republic&quot; or under imperial reign. In this context, scholars suggest &quot;commonwealth&quot; as a more accurate and neutral translation of the Latin term, as it implies neither &quot;republican&quot; governance nor &quot;imperial&quot; rule, but rather refers to the state as a whole; however, translating &quot;res publica&quot; as &quot;republic&quot; when it clearly refers to the Roman Empire &quot;under Imperial reign&quot; sometimes occurs.

===Roman Republic===
Roman authors would use the phrase &quot;res publica&quot; in the context of the era when Rome was governed as a republic: the era between the Roman Kingdom and Roman Empire. So in this case, &quot;res publica&quot; does distinctly &quot;not&quot; refer to the Roman &quot;Empire&quot;, but to what is generally described as the Roman Republic.

===Public affairs or institutions===
&quot;Res publica&quot; could also be used in a generic meaning, referring to &quot;public affairs&quot; and/or the general system of government of a state. In this usage, &quot;res publica&quot; translated the Greek concept &quot;politeia&quot; (which originally meant the state organisation of a city-state). Also, for a Roman politician engaging himself in the &quot;res publica&quot;, a translation can often be the even more generic &quot;being occupied in politics&quot;.

===Other uses===
Even when limited to its &quot;political&quot; connotations, the meanings of the term &quot;res publica&quot; in ancient Rome are diverse and multi-layered, and differing from the Greek &quot;politeia&quot; in many ways, that is, from the several interwoven meanings the word &quot;politeia&quot; had; however, it is also the customary Latin translation of &quot;politeia&quot;, and the modern name of Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot; comes from this usage. In some contexts, the &quot;state organisation system&quot; meaning of &quot;res publica&quot; derives into something like &quot;constitution&quot;, although a constitution, properly speaking, is a much more modern concept. Ancient Romans would use the expression &quot;Twelve Tables&quot; instead of &quot;res publica&quot;, when referring to their constitution at the time of the republic, and the &quot;inalterable laws installed by the divine Augustus&quot;, for their equivalent of a constitution in the era of the early Empire. After the Roman Empire collapsed in the West, the idea of &quot;res publica&quot; disappeared, as foreign to the barbarians of the Migrations Period: whenever Gregory of Tours refers to &quot;res publica&quot;, it is the Eastern Empire of which he is speaking.

===Quotations===
The translations of the quotations below are copied without alteration from existing non-copyrighted material. Other translations might differ, but they all serve to illustrate the many aspects of the &quot;res publica&quot; concept in ancient Rome. The Latin original texts are given concurrently with the translations, in order to show that only the &quot;context&quot; of the text allows to interpret the &quot;res publica&quot; concept in each instance. From these examples, it also follows that probably there was also a gradual shift of meaning of the &quot;res publica&quot; concept throughout the Roman era: the &quot;(Roman) Republic&quot; connotation of &quot;res publica&quot; is something that rather occurs &quot;with retrospect&quot; to a closed period (so &quot;less&quot; apparent in Cicero&#x27;s time, who never knew the era of the Emperors, and could only compare with the epoch of the Kings); on the other hand the &quot;translation of the Greek &quot;politeia&quot; concept&quot; appears to have nearly completely worn off in late antiquity.

====Cicero====
Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De re publica&quot; (this translates as &quot;about the res publica&quot;), a treatise of the 1st century BC in Socratic dialogue format, takes the &quot;res publica&quot; as its subject. The differing interpretations and translations of the &quot;title&quot; of that work are discussed in the &quot;De re publica&quot; article. The expression &quot;res publica&quot; is used several times throughout the work too. The quotes below aim at demonstrating that &quot;within any translation&quot; of Cicero&#x27;s work differing English translations of the term &quot;res publica&quot; need to be used, according to &quot;context&quot;, in order to make sense. The quotes are taken from the Latin text at &quot;The Latin Library&quot; (chapter numbering follows this text), from C. D. Yonge&#x27;s translation at gutenberg.org (2nd column) and from Francis Barham&#x27;s translation at &quot;The Online Library of Liberty&quot; (3rd column).

When Cicero refers to the Greek authors (pointing at the &quot;politeia&quot; concept):
When pointing at the &quot;Roman&quot; context:
The translation shows that the meaning of &quot;res publica&quot; can differ &quot;even within the same paragraph&quot;...

====Pliny the Elder====
When Pliny dedicates his &quot;Naturalis Historiae&quot; to his friend Emperor Vespasian in the first century, he uses the word res publica (Latin from LacusCurtius website / 1601 Philemon Holland translation from http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html / 1855 John Bostock translation from the Perseus website):
When under an &quot;Emperor&quot;, that is Vespasian or his predecessors, Pliny was not talking about the Roman Republic, but used &quot;commonwealth&quot;/&quot;republic&quot; in the meaning of &quot;the state&quot;. The ambiguity of Rome still considering itself formally, or just &quot;pro forma&quot;, a republic throughout the era of the principate, when a monarchic rule had already de facto been established, adds to the complexity of translating &quot;res publica&quot; in this context.

====Tacitus====
As another example of the complexities of the meaning of the word &quot;res publica&quot; one can cite Tacitus, who in the early 2nd century described in his &quot;Annals&quot; how the first Emperors, like Tiberius in the year Augustus had died (AD 14), sought to preserve all institutions of the &quot;Res publica&quot; completely intact (Latin and translation as available at the Perseus Project):
... while Tacitus complained in the same writing that at the same time the &quot;res publica&quot; went astray for good because not a single soul seemed to care any more:
The least that can be said is that the two quotes above (like so many passages in Tacitus&#x27; writings) are a translator&#x27;s minefield:
* In the first quote above Tacitus qualifies the &quot;res publica&quot; he intends as &quot;vetus&quot; (the &quot;old&quot; res publica) - which implies he knows another, not &quot;old&quot;, &quot;re(s)public(a)&quot;, while Tacitus&#x27; dense writing style would usually avoid redundancies. Nonetheless in the second quote, actually preceding the first in the text of the &quot;Annals&quot;, &quot;res publica&quot; does &quot;not&quot; have such qualifier, while in the context it is clear he meant the then lost republican form of government.
* &quot;imperandi&quot;, litt. &quot;to command&quot;, is translated as &quot;being emperor&quot; - while the &quot;emperor&quot; concept (which in fact did not yet &quot;literally&quot; exist in the time Tacitus describes here, and so could not be assigned to Tiberius as an &quot;intention&quot;) was usually indicated as &quot;princeps&quot; by Tacitus.
* &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; is translated as &quot;title of Tribune&quot;, while the &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; is more about exercising the &quot;power&quot; of a tribune without actually &quot;being&quot; a Tribune, and had been an invention of Caesar Augustus (compare to Holland and Bostock translations for the same concept in the Pliny quote above: &quot;sacred authoritie of the Tribunes&quot; and &quot;the tribunate&quot;, respectively).
Nonetheless it can only be admired in Tacitus how, with some judicially chosen words, he most poignantly and to the point describes the transition from &quot;(overdue) remnants of the republic&quot; to &quot;actual Imperial reign, already established in the minds of people&quot;.

In his book &quot;Germania&quot;, Tacitus also uses &quot;res publica&quot; in the context of the Germanic &quot;barbarian&quot; society. Here the word is used to convey the generic meaning of &quot;public affair&quot; or &quot;the commonwealth&quot; (in contrast to the private or family life) without the Roman connotations of republicanism. This is illustrated in the following text (Latin text and English translation from the Perseus Project):

====Augustine====

Augustine of Hippo uses the word &quot;res publica&quot; several times throughout his work &quot;The City of God&quot;, in which he comments, in the early 5th century on several Greek and Roman authors. Again, the standard translations of the expression &quot;res publica&quot; are multiple throughout the work. Examples taken from the Latin text at &quot;The Latin Library&quot;, English translation from the version available at &quot;New Advent&quot;

Meaning &quot;the (Roman) state&quot; in general:
Note that in this quote Augustine does &quot;not&quot; use the expression &quot;imperium Romanum&quot; (&quot;the Roman empire&quot;) as a synonym to &quot;the era when Rome was governed by emperors&quot;. Compare also to the 2nd quote from Tacitus above: there an expression &quot;different&quot; from &quot;res publica&quot; and &quot;imperium Romanum&quot; is used for referring to &quot;the (Roman) State&quot; in general.

Meaning &quot;the Roman Republic&quot; as &quot;era&quot; with a distinct form of state organisation, from the same book:

==Calques==
Later calques of &quot;Res publica&quot;:
* Commonwealth (English – 2nd meaning as indicated above)
* &quot;chose publique&quot; (French)
* &quot;cosa pubblica&quot; (Italian)
* Rzeczpospolita (Polish)
* Civitas
* Public

<text>Michael Everson (born January 1963) is an American and Irish linguist, script encoder, typesetter, type designer and publisher. He runs a publishing company called Evertype, through which he has published over one hundred books since 2006.

His central area of expertise is with writing systems of the world, specifically in the representation of these systems in formats for computer and digital media. In 2003 Rick McGowan said he was &quot;probably the world&#x27;s leading expert in the computer encoding of scripts&quot; for his work to add a wide variety of scripts and characters to the Universal Character Set. Since 1993, he has written over two hundred proposals which have added thousands of characters to ISO/IEC 10646 and the Unicode standard; as of 2003, he was credited as the leading contributor of Unicode proposals.

==Life==

Everson was born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and moved to Tucson, Arizona, at the age of 12. His interest in the works of J. R. R. Tolkien led him to study Old English and then other Germanic languages. He read German, Spanish, and French for his B.A. at the University of Arizona (1985), and the History of Religions and Indo-European linguistics for his M.A. at the University of California, Los Angeles (1988).

In 1989, a former professor, Dr. Marija Gimbutas, asked him to read a paper on Basque mythology at an Indo-Europeanist Conference held in Ireland; shortly thereafter he moved to Dublin, where he studied as a Fulbright Scholar in the Faculty of Celtic Studies, University College Dublin (1991). He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 2000, although he retains American citizenship.

==Work==
Everson is active in supporting minority-language communities, especially in the fields of character encoding standardization and internationalization. In addition to being one of the primary contributing editors of the Unicode Standard, he is also a contributing editor to ISO/IEC 10646, registrar for ISO 15924, and subtag reviewer for BCP 47. He has contributed to the encoding of many scripts and characters in those standards, receiving the Unicode Bulldog Award in 2000 for his technical contributions to the development and promotion of the Unicode Standard. In 2004, Everson was appointed convenor of ISO TC46/WG3 (Conversion of Written Languages), which is responsible for transliteration standards.

Everson is one of the co-editors (along with Rick McGowan, Ken Whistler, and V.S. Umamaheswaran) of the Unicode roadmaps that detail actual and proposed allocations for current and future Unicode scripts and blocks.

On July 1, 2012, Everson was appointed to the Volapük Academy by the Cifal, Brian R. Bishop, for his work in Volapük publishing.

===Encoding of scripts===
Everson has been actively involved in the encoding of many scripts in the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 standards, including Avestan, Balinese, Bamum, Bassa Vah, Batak, Braille, Brāhmī, Buginese, Buhid, Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, Carian, Cham, Cherokee, Coptic, Cuneiform, Cypriot, Deseret, Duployan, Egyptian hieroglyphs, Elbasan, Ethiopic, Georgian, Glagolitic, Gothic, Hanunóo, Imperial Aramaic, Inscriptional Pahlavi, Inscriptional Parthian, Javanese, Kayah Li, Khmer, Lepcha, Limbu, Linear A, Linear B, Lycian, Lydian, Mandaic, Manichaean, Meitei Mayek, Mongolian, Myanmar, Nabataean, New Tai Lue, N&#x27;Ko, Ogham, Ol Chiki, Old Hungarian, Old Italic, Old North Arabian, Old Persian, Old South Arabian, Old Turkic, Osmanya, Palmyrene, Phaistos Disc, Phoenician, Rejang, Runic, Samaritan, Saurashtra, Shavian, Sinhala, Sundanese, Tagalog, Tagbanwa, Tai Le, Tai Tham, Thaana, Tibetan, Ugaritic, Vai, and Yi, as well as many characters belonging to the Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and Arabic scripts.

===Encoding of symbols===
Everson authored or co-authored proposals for many symbol characters for encoding into Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646. Among those proposals submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2/WG 2 that have been accepted and encoded: N2586R ( and four other miscellaneous symbols admitted into Unicode 4.1), N3727 (the 26 Regional Indicator Symbols used in pairs to generate national flags in emoji contexts; adopted into Unicode 6.0), and N4783R2 (chess notation symbols encoded into Unicode 11.0).

Among proposals that have not yet been approved for encoding: N1866 (an early proposal for encoding Blissymbols into the Supplementary Multilingual Plane of Unicode; still listed in the SMP roadmap as of Unicode 15.0 although no further action had been taken on it for years).

Everson, along with Doug Ewell, Rebecca Bettencourt, Ricardo Bánffy, Eduardo Marín Silva, Elias Mårtenson, Mark Shoulson, Shawn Steele, and Rebecca Turner, is a contributor to the Terminals Working Group researching obscure characters found in legacy character sets used by home computers (or &quot;microcomputers&quot;), terminals, and other legacy devices made from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s; thanks to their proposal L2/19-025, 212 graphic characters for compatibility with MSX, Commodore 64, and other microcomputers of the era, as well as Teletext, were encoded in the Symbols for Legacy Computing block, while 731 additional characters from L2/21-235 have been accepted for a future version of the standard.

===Font development===
In 1995 he designed a Unicode font, Everson Mono, a monospaced typeface with more than 4,800 characters. This font was the third Unicode-encoded font to contain a large number of characters from many character blocks, after Lucida Sans Unicode and Unihan font (both 1993). In 2007 he was commissioned by the International Association of Coptic Studies to create a standard free Unicode 5.1 font for Coptic, &quot;Antinoou&quot;, using the Sahidic style.

===Conscript Unicode Registry===
Together with John Cowan, he is also responsible for the ConScript Unicode Registry, a project to coordinate the mapping of artificial scripts into the Unicode Private Use Area. Among the scripts &quot;encoded&quot; in the CSUR, Shavian and Deseret were eventually formally adopted into Unicode; two other conscripts under consideration are Tolkien&#x27;s scripts of Tengwar and Cirth.

===Language and locale information===
Everson has also created locale and language information for many languages, from support for the Irish language and the other Celtic languages to the minority Languages of Finland. In 2000, together with Trond Trosterud, he co-authored Software localization into Nynorsk Norwegian, a report commissioned by the Norwegian Language Council. In 2003 he was commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme to prepare a report on the computer locale requirements for the major languages of Afghanistan (Pashto, Dari, and Uzbek), co-authored by Roozbeh Pournader, which was endorsed by the Ministry of Communications of the Afghan Transitional Islamic Administration. More recently, UNESCO&#x27;s Initiative B@bel funded Everson&#x27;s work to encode the N&#x27;Ko and Balinese scripts.

===Work on a standard for Cornish===
In 2007 he co-authored a proposal for a new standard written form of Cornish, called Kernowek Standard. Following the publication of the Standard Written Form in 2008, Everson and a group of other users examined the specification and implemented a set of modifications to it, publishing a formal specification in 2012.

===Publishing at Evertype===
 Everson operates a publishing company, Evertype, through which he has published a total of 295 books. These include a wide range of titles by various authors and editors, with Everson himself as co-author of one, editor of several, and having adapted or revised several more. He also designed fonts for several.

Everson has a particular interest in Gaelic typeface design, and does a considerable amount of work typesetting books in Irish for publication by Evertype.

Another project consists of his publications of translations of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; in many languages, amongst which are minority languages and constructed languages. Translations are available in Cornish, Esperanto, French, German, Hawaiian, Irish, Italian, Jèrriais, Ladino, Latin, Lingua Franca Nova, Lingwa de planeta, Low German, Manx, Mennonite Low German, Borain Picard, Sambahsa, Scots, Shavian transliteration, Swedish, Ulster Scots and Welsh, with several other translations being prepared.

<text>Ignacio Ellacuría (November 9, 1930 – November 16, 1989) was a Spanish-Salvadoran Jesuit, philosopher, and theologian who worked as a professor and rector at the Universidad Centroamericana &quot;José Simeón Cañas&quot; (UCA), a Jesuit university in El Salvador founded in 1965. He and several other Jesuits and two others were assassinated by Salvadoran soldiers in the closing years of the Salvadoran Civil War. 

His work was defining for the shape UCA took in its first years of existence and the years to come. Ellacuría was also responsible for the development of formation programs for priests in the Jesuit Central American province.

== Biography ==
Ellacuría joined the Jesuits in 1947 and was commissioned to the Central American republic of El Salvador in 1948. He lived and worked there for much of his life until his assassination in 1989. In 1958, Ellacuría studied theology with Vatican II theologian Karl Rahner in Innsbruck, Austria. He also lived in Ecuador and Spain.

Ellacuría&#x27;s academic work was an important contribution to &quot;Liberation Philosophy&quot;. This school of philosophy stems from the work of Augusto Salazar Bondy and Leopoldo Zea. It focuses on liberating the oppressed in order &quot;to reach the fullness of humanity&quot;. Ellacuría was also a strong supporter and contributor to Liberation Theology. There are different types of Latin American liberation philosophy. Ellacuría&#x27;s thought represents one of the currents within this philosophical tradition.

The political implications of Ellacuría&#x27;s commitment to his ideas met strong opposition from the conservative religious and political forces in El Salvador. This opposition led to Ellacuría&#x27;s murder by the Salvadoran army in 1989 at his residence in UCA along with five other fellow Jesuit priests and two employees. 

Their murder marked a turning point in the Salvadoran civil war (see History of El Salvador). On the one hand, it increased international pressures on the Salvadoran government to sign peace agreements with the guerrilla organisation FMLN. On the other, it helped make Ellacuría&#x27;s ideas (until then known only in Latin America and Spain) known worldwide.

==Philosophy==
Ellacuría&#x27;s philosophy takes as a starting point Xavier Zubiri&#x27;s (1898–1983) critique of Western philosophy. For Zubiri, ever since Parmenides, Western thought separated sensing from intelligence. This error led to two results. The first one was what Zubiri called &quot;the logification of intelligence&quot; and the second one was what he called &quot;the entification of reality&quot;.

The &quot;logification of intelligence&quot; implied that intellect was reduced to logos. This view led philosophers to believe that what they called &quot;Being&quot; was the cause of reality, and this in turn, explained the confusion of metaphysics with ontology.

Logification of intelligence excludes sensual, not so logical, functions of intelligence. Although Zubiri recognized descriptive logos and reason as important components of intelligence, he pointed out that intelligence did not reduce itself to them. For Zubiri intelligence was a unity with the modalities of sensual apprehension, logos and reason.

The logification of intelligence led to the perception of reality as &quot;Being&quot; in a zone in space and time (as in Heidegger&#x27;s Dasein) of identifiable entities with an essence, outside the human brain. This is what Zubiri called the &quot;entification of reality&quot;. This perception sees reality as a particular form of &quot;Being&quot;. Thereby, for Zubiri, &quot;Being&quot; had been &quot;substantivised&quot; by Western philosophy.

For Zubiri, reality is paramount to Being, which is not a noun, but a verb. Being is a particular aspect of reality and not the other way around. Metaphysics studies reality and ontology studies being. Human beings&#x27; way of accessing reality is intelligence, not a logified one, but a &quot;sentient intelligence&quot; that is itself a part of reality.

The senses, logic, reason, intuition and imagination are one and the same faculty, because each of these things determine one another. This faculty differences human beings from other species and has been achieved through evolution. Having a sentient intelligence implies having a conscience and the possibility to imagine new realities. These formulations are in themselves real by postulation. Realities by postulation can also be realised in other forms, because sentient intelligence has the ability to recognise the processual and structural character of reality. Therefore, human beings are able to influence it, and create and transcend the historical boundaries that have been reached.

For Zubiri there is no need for a realist/anti-realist discussion on if there is or not a reality that is external and independent to human beings, or if reality is a bulk of internal illusions to human beings. It is both, but not in the sense critical realism pretends (where human beings are seen as a reality that can be separated from an objective outer reality). For Zubiri, human beings are imbedded in reality and cannot exist without it. They need air, food, water and other beings. The &quot;outer&quot; and objective world must also come inside human beings for them to continue existing. Sentient intelligence should be able to make sense of this existence in a way that allows human beings to realise their capabilities in the world.

In this line of thinking, Ellacuría said human reality is unavoidably personal, social and historical. Biology and society are elements of history, which means that they are always in movement. But this should not be confused with historical materialism that says human beings are passive instruments of the forces of history. Human beings certainly inherit constraints constructed in the past but they always have the possibility to transcend them because of their sentient intelligence. Praxis is the name Ellacuría gives to reflected human action aimed at changing reality. Unlike other animals that can only respond mechanically to stimuli from outside, through sentient intelligence and praxis, human beings have to &quot;realise&quot; their existence. Individuals in dialectic interaction with society, have to make out what sort of Ego to have, by using their sentient intelligence, and this implies transcending inherited constraints.

This means that progress in reality happens through a combination of physical, biological and &quot;praxical&quot; factors. Through praxis, human beings are able to realise a wider range of possibilities for action. In other words, one praxis can lead to a wider and more complete form of praxis. When this is so, praxis can be said to contribute to increased liberty, if liberty is defined as greater possibilities for action.

According to Ellacuría, the existence of people that are marginalized from society implies that history and practice have not delivered a wider range of possibilities for realisation for every human being in the world. This situation has prevented these excluded people to realise their existence as human beings. Therefore, it is a situation that stands away from the fullness of humanity and the fullness of reality. But this situation can be changed.

Ellacuría thought that before the evolution of humanity, the further development of historical reality took place only by physical and biological forces. But since the development of human beings, praxis can also contribute to realise historical reality. Since human beings have the possibility to reflect, it is philosophy&#x27;s duty to exercise this ability to reflect, in order to change reality, and allow greater possibilities for individual realisation.

This way of thinking finds its parallels in the 1990s in Martha Nussbaum&#x27;s definition of human development as the increase in human capabilities for action and Amartya Sen&#x27;s notion of development as freedom.

==Theology==
As many other theologians of his generation, Ellacuría intended to construct a new theology, which he called a Historical Theology. Methodologically, his view of history followed the Hegelian dialectic tradition, that culminated in Marx&#x27;s historical materialism. However, in terms of content, he was also critical of Hegel&#x27;s eurocentric view of history. Ellacuría rejected as well Marx&#x27;s view of human beings as objects of their material conditions. He stressed the importance of conscience, human praxis and its possibilities for influencing the course of history, and thereby material conditions themselves. Critics have accused him of contaminating theology with Marxism. His thought shares with Marxism a common Hegelian view of history as progress brought about by overcoming contradictions. Some, as Enrique Dussel, would claim that the similarities between liberation theology and Marx&#x27;s thought are to be found in common origins of the narrative of liberation in the Judeo-Christian tradition of thought.

By Historical Theology Ellacuría meant a way of making theology: to reflect about faith from the historical present and to reflect about the historical present from faith. According to him, all theology is conditioned by its historical present. Historical theology intends to acquire conscience about its historical context and to incorporate it fully. The concept of locus theologicus (theological place) is very important in this theology.

Rudolf Bultmann developed existential biblical hermeneutics, or the idea that each individual can only read and understand the bible from his or her personal existential condition, and the biblical text acquires life only if it can awaken an experience of faith in the reader. This generates a hermeneutical circle, since the reader understands the Bible from his historical present and the historical present from the Bible. Ellacuría placed himself in this hermeneutic tradition, and he gave a step further. For Ellacuría, the reader is not just an individual but a community, just like the people of Israel in the Old Testament. This means that community faith comes first, and then individual faith.

According to Ellacuría, the value of the Old Testament is not reduced with the New Testament. The New Testament makes the community character of faith from the Old Testament something radical and universal. It makes it radical, because it establishes that the alliance of God with people is much more than a simple code of laws and liturgical rituals; it is an invitation to justice and charity, not as exceptional practices, but as a stable structure. That is why this alliance is established in a law. It makes the faith universal, because the New Testament is communicated to every human being, independently of race, culture, sex, religion or social condition.

Liberation Theology is then, according to Ellacuría, a new way of doing Historical Theology in a particular locus theologicus: the historical present of Latin America, where a large portion of the population is oppressed by structures that deny them the possibilities to satisfy their needs and to develop. It arises from the spirit of &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; of the Second Vatican Council and the social encyclicals of Pope John XXIII, and more specifically, the Episcopal Conferences of Medellín in 1968 and Puebla in 1978. Such a reflection on the Bible is supported on the historical present of a collectivity that desires liberation from oppression. There is a long biblical tradition about liberation that starts with the Book of Exodus.

According to Ellacuría, salvation is accomplished historically, not just individually, but collectively. It is not just about liberation from evil, guilt, personal or social offenses, pain, disease and fetichism. Those forms of liberation only start by liberation from unjust structures like slavery, political domination, psychological and social oppression. Besides the book of Exodus, the Bible also presents other such cases of liberation from oppression as the return from exile in Babylon in the books of Esdras and Nehemiah; the fight against Macedonian occupation in the book of Maccabees; the Beatitudes of Jesus; and the book of Apocalypse in the face of the persecution of Christians in Rome.

Other forms of doing historical theology would be for example Feminist Theology; Black liberation theology as developed by James Cone in the fight for civil rights in the United States; African Liberation Theology, that has mostly been applied to South Africa in the fight against apartheid; and Indigenous Theology that stems from Bartolomé de las Casas and other missionaries in the first Spanish colonies in the Americas in the 16th century.

===Union of science and theology===
In his commencement address to Santa Clara University in 1982, Ellacuría addressed the challenges implied in relating theology with science. He articulated a relationship between the two in his vision of a university that served the purpose of liberating the oppressed. According to Ellacuría, there are two aspects to every university. The most evident one is that it deals with culture, or, in other words, knowledge and the use of sentient intellect. The second, and not so evident, is that it must be concerned with the social reality, precisely because a university is inescapably a social force; it must transform and enlighten the society in which it lives.

Ellacuría believed that a university cannot always and in every place be the same. It must constantly look at its own peculiar historical reality. The Third World is characterized more by oppression than by liberty, more by poverty than by abundance. According to Ellacuría, in such a context a university must do everything possible so that liberty overcomes oppression. He added that the university must carry out this general commitment with the means uniquely at its disposal. As an intellectual community, the university must analyse causes; use imagination and creativity together to discover remedies to problems; communicate a consciousness that inspires the freedom of self-determination; educate professionals with a conscience, who will be the immediate instruments of such a transformation; and constantly hone an educational institution that is both academically excellent and ethically oriented.

Ellacuría thought that it is possible for reason and faith to merge in confronting the reality of the poor. Reason must open its eyes to their suffering, while faith sees in the weak of this world what salvation must mean and the conversion to which we are called.

Such a university must take into account the preferential option for the poor. This does not mean that only the poor will study at the university; it does not mean that the university should abdicate its mission of academic excellence, an excellence which is needed in order to solve complex social issues of our time. What it does mean, he argued, is that the university should be present intellectually where it is needed; to provide science for those without science; to provide skills for those without skills; to be a voice for those without voices; to give intellectual support, for those who do not possess the academic qualifications to make their rights legitimate.

== Sainthood ==

<doc id="584036" wikidata="Q1930867" url="?curid=584036" title="USS Iwo Jima (LPH-2)">
<text>USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; (LPH-2) was the lead ship of her class and type and the first amphibious assault ship to be designed and built from the keel up as a dedicated helicopter carrier. She carried helicopters and typically embarked USMC elements of a Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU)/later Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) principally the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) to conduct heliborne operations in support of an amphibious operation. There was no well deck to support landing craft movement of personnel or equipment to/from shore. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was the second of three ships of the United States Navy to be named for the Battle of Iwo Jima, although the first to be completed and see service (the first was cancelled during construction).

==First cruises and Cuban Missile Crisis==
&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was laid down on 2 April 1959 by Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington; launched on 17 September 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Harry Schmidt; and commissioned on 26 August 1961.

Following shakedown training, she spent the rest of 1961 off the California coast in amphibious exercises. In April 1962, the ship joined Joint Task Force 8 in the Johnston Island-Hawaii area for an important series of nuclear tests. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; evacuated several islands and took part in the test evaluation. On 26 July, she sailed from the test area to Pearl Harbor, and continued on to San Diego, where she arrived on 10 August 1962.

In September, the ship took part in full-scale amphibious exercises in California, departing from San Diego on 17 October for her first deployment to the western Pacific. However, as the crisis flared up on 19 October over the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; returned to San Diego, embarked Marines 22 to 27 October, and departed quickly for the Caribbean. As part of America&#x27;s powerful and mobile force afloat, she cruised in a &quot;ready&quot; status until December brought an easing of the Cuban situation. She arrived in San Diego on 13 December.

==WestPac cruises==
&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; operated out of her home port during the first half of 1963, carrying out amphibious exercises and training. She departed on 30 August on her long-delayed Western Pacific cruise. Joining the 7th Fleet, she ranged from Hawaii to the Philippines and Taiwan.

On 31 October 1963, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; departed Philippine waters for special operations along the coast of South Vietnam, standing by to protect American nationals during a period of increased strife. She returned to Subic Bay on 12 November. The following months, she sailed with Special Landing Forces of Marines for rigorous amphibious assault and landing raids practice off the coasts of Taiwan and Okinawa. After unloading ammunition at Sasebo, Japan, she departed on 13 April 1964 to return to San Diego, arriving on 28 April. Following amphibious training with Marines along the California seaboard, she overhauled in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. This work was completed by 7 December 1964, when &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; began amphibious refresher training ranging to the Hawaiian Islands. On 13 March 1965, she departed Pearl Harbor for San Diego, arriving six days later.

==Vietnam War==

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; received tons of supplies and scores of Army helicopters, tanker trucks, and vehicles in her hangar and flight deck spaces. Nearly 1,000 troops were embarked for her western transit, which began on 12 April 1965. She stopped at Pearl Harbor for a few hours on the 17th to off-load 50 Marines and their equipment. On 1/2 May, she steamed off Vũng Tàu, South Vietnam, flying off 77 Army helicopters loaded with troops and combat cargo. From there, she proceeded to Subic Bay in the Philippines, where troops and equipment were received for amphibious landing and by helicopter at Chu Lai, Vietnam, on 12 May 1965.

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; remained off Chu Lai for a month, protecting Marines and Seabees establishing an air field on the sandy shore. Besides helicopter support ashore, including defense perimeter patrol, she was a support center for laundry, showers, fresh provisions, store, and mail service. She also supervised the continual off-load of ships over the beach for the entire month, then on 7 June 1965, landed squadron personnel and helicopters ashore at Phu Bai Combat Base, some 30 miles north of Da Nang. After a few days rest in Subic Bay, she was routed to Sasebo, thence to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she embarked Marines and equipment. This was completed on 26 June 1965, when she sailed for Qui Nhon, Republic of Vietnam, in company with and . These ships were designated Task Group 76.5, that part of the 7th Fleet that carries the Marine Special Landing Force. On the 30th, she arrived at Qui Nhon, about 100 miles south of Chu Lai. The following day, Marines landed ashore to take up defensive positions for the protection of Army engineers and communications units.

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; remained off Qui Nhon for defensive support until 20 July 1965, then steamed for Pratas Reef about 240 miles southwest of Taiwan. Arriving the morning of the 22nd, her helicopters were immediately pressed into service to aid the salvage of destroyer . The close approach of typhoon &quot;Gilda&quot; pounded the grounded destroyer so badly that it was impossible for small boats to get alongside her. Extra men were heli-lifted off the destroyer while surf rose 12 feet high to break completely over the stern of &quot;Frank Knox&quot;. Support given by &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; included such items as hot food, clothes, water, pumps, hose, gasoline, air compressors, welding machines, damage control equipment, and technicians. Feed water was heli-lifted in special tanks constructed by the destroyer tender , which had faint hope of keeping the destroyer&#x27;s boiler alive. Detached from this duty on 1 August 1965, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; made a brief call at Hong Kong, then proceeded to the Philippines.

On 17 August 1965, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; steamed out of Subic Bay for Vung Tau, Republic of Vietnam, to join in Operation Starlite, a five-day search-and-destroy operation that killed some 600 Viet Cong. The successful Navy-Marine Corps amphibious operation, backed by gunfire support from the cruiser and two destroyers, came to a close late on 24 August. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;″s evacuation and surgical teams kept the American casualties down to a very low percentage. During transit back to Subic Bay, she learned the &quot;Frank Knox&quot; had been refloated, good news for the crew who had put in so many hard and long hours at Pratas Reef. She landed her Marine Special Landing Force at Chu Lai on 1/2 September, embarked 800 Marines of a rotation draft, and sailed for Buckner Bay.

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; landed the rotation troops at Okinawa, then came off Qui Nhon, 10 September 1965, to cover the landing of the Army&#x27;s 1st Air Cavalry Division. She had supported three amphibious assault search-and-destroy raids along the coast by 1 October, when she steamed to southern waters, remaining in stand-by status for possible evacuation of U.S. nationals in revolt-torn Indonesia. Eight days later, she sailed for Danang for a helicopter squadron exchange, thence to Subic Bay where she was relieved by . Following a visit to Yokosuka, she departed 1 November for return to San Diego, arriving 17 November 1965. Several months later, she again joined the 7th Fleet Amphibious Ready Group, a fast-moving assault force that had completed more than 20 search-and-destroy operations along the South Vietnamese coast between March 1965 and September 1966. One of these missions, Operation Deckhouse IV hit only 3 miles south of the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone to search out and decimate a regiment of the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam 342B Division, which had infiltrated into South Vietnam.

During the first three months of 1966, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was at San Diego for upkeep and improvement changes. From April through June, extensive refresher training occupied all hands as &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; prepared for her forthcoming Western Pacific deployment. On 24 July, steaming with a task group, she passed the island of Iwo Jima, on board was one of the Marine groups that had landed on Iwo Jima over two decades earlier. After operations in the Vietnam area, she sailed for Japan. &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was on the line and underway for special operations in the Mekong Delta region of South Vietnam by 30 December once again, in a Navy-ready group with a two-pronged punch. Early in January 1967, the commanding officer, Captain Nils W. Boe, was relieved by Captain F. X. Timmes. On his departure, Captain Boe said of his crew in a family-gram to mothers and wives, &quot;I want to thank each of you for letting me borrow these magnificent young men for a little while. They have made me feel ten feet tall.&quot; On 1 July 1967, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was reassigned to Amphibious Squadron 3 from Amphibious Squadron 1, with which she continued to sail with the Pacific Fleet.

==Pacific recovery forces (Task Force 130)==

On 17 April 1970, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was the flagship of Task Force 130 that waited for the Apollo 13 spaceship&#x27;s astronauts after their memorable &quot;successful failure&quot; mission and splashdown near American Samoa.

In the 1995 film &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was played by her sister ship, . &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;″s skipper, Captain Leland Kirkemo, is portrayed by the film&#x27;s central protagonist, Captain Jim Lovell.

== Multinational Peacekeeping Force==
From 10 May 1983 to 8 December 1983, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; operated off the Lebanese coast as part of Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group 2-83 (Marg 2-83). The ships hosted the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (24th MAU), the main body of which disembarked on 29 May to take position in and around Beirut International Airport, relieving the 22nd MAU as the principal US component of the Multinational Force in Lebanon. On 23 October 1983, an attack on the Marine&#x27;s barracks caused the death of 241 US servicemen and wounded a further 60.
The ship&#x27;s commanding officer at the time was Arden W. Jones, CAPT USN. During the deployment, it served as the flagship for Amphibious Squadron Eight (PHIBRON-8), with Morgan France, CAPT USN serving as squadron commander (AKA Commodore&quot;).

== Friendly fire incident ==
On 11 October 1989, was conducting a live fire exercise off the east coast of the United States using the Phalanx against a target drone. The drone was successfully engaged, but as the drone fell to the sea, the CIWS re-engaged it as a continued threat to &quot;El Paso.&quot; Rounds from the Phalanx struck the bridge of &quot;Iwo Jima,&quot; killing one officer and injuring a petty officer.

==Catastrophic boiler accident ==

In October 1990, &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was in the Persian Gulf, as part of the buildup for Operation Desert Shield. After two months of operation there she developed a leak in a steam valve which supplied steam to a stand-by electrical generator. She docked in Manama, Bahrain, where the valve was repaired by a local contractor under US government inspection.

Repairs were completed towards the end of October. On 30 October, as she raised steam to get underway and rejoin the fleet, the valve began to leak once more. The bonnet blew off the valve, flooding the boiler room with steam from two boilers. Ten of the eleven crewmen in the room were killed during or immediately after the incident, with the last surviving until 23:30 that evening.

The cause of the accident was determined to be the use of fasteners of the wrong material (namely black oxide coated brass) on the valve, combined with a lack of proper inspection.

== Decommissioning ==

&quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was decommissioned on 14 July 1993, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 September. She was sold for scrap on 18 December 1995. The ship&#x27;s island was at the Museum of the American GI in College Station, Texas, for several years but due to no funding for maintenance it was scrapped.

== Potential role in the Falklands War ==
A July 2012 article by USNI News of the United States Naval Institute revealed that the Reagan Administration offered the use of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; as a replacement in case either of the two British carriers, and , had been damaged or destroyed during the 1982 Falklands War. This top-secret contingency plan was revealed to the staff of the Naval Institute by John Lehman, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy at the time of the Falklands War, from a speech provided to the Naval Institute that Lehman made in Portsmouth, UK on 26 June 2012. Lehman stated that the loan of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; was made in response to a request from the Royal Navy, and it had the endorsement of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. The actual planning for &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; loan-out was done by the staff of the U.S. Second Fleet under the direction of Vice Admiral James Lyons, who confirmed Lehman&#x27;s revelations with the Naval Institute staff. Contingency planning envisioned American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge of &quot;Iwo Jima&quot;″s systems, assisting the British in manning the U.S. helicopter carrier during the loan-out. Naval analyst Eric Wertheim compared this arrangement to the Flying Tigers. Significantly, except for U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the U.S. Department of State was not included in the loan-out negotiations.

<text>Pickaninny (also picaninny, piccaninny or pickininnie) is a pidgin word for a small child, possibly derived from the Portuguese (&#x27;boy, child, very small, tiny&#x27;). It has been used as a racial slur for African American children and a pejorative term for Aboriginal children of the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. It can also refer to a derogatory caricature of a dark-skinned child of African descent.

==Origins and usage==
The origins of the word &quot;pickaninny&quot; (and its alternative spellings &quot;picaninny&quot; and &quot;piccaninny&quot;) are disputed; it may derive from the Portuguese term for a small child, , meaning &quot;tiny&quot;. The term was apparently used in the seventeenth century by slaves in the West Indies to affectionately refer to a child of any race. &quot;Pickaninny&quot; acquired a pejorative connotation by the nineteenth century as a term for black children in the United States, as well as aboriginal children of the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand.

===Similar terms in Pidgin and Creole languages===
The term &quot;piccanin&quot;, derived from the Portuguese , has along with several variants become widely used in pidgin languages, meaning &#x27;small&#x27;. This term is common in the creole languages of the Caribbean, especially those which are English-based. In Jamaican Patois, the word is found as , which is used to describe a child regardless of racial origin. The same word is used in Antiguan and Barbudan Creole to mean &quot;children&quot;, while in the English-based national creole language of Suriname, Sranang Tongo, has been borrowed as for &#x27;small&#x27; and &#x27;child&#x27;.

The term is found in Melanesian pidgin and creole languages such as Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea or Bislama of Vanuatu, as the usual word for &#x27;child&#x27; (of a person or animal); it may refer to children of any race. For example, Charles III used the term in a speech he gave in Tok Pisin during a formal event: he described himself as (i.e. the first child of the Queen).

In Nigerian as well as Cameroonian Pidgin English, the word is used to mean a child. It can be heard in songs by African popular musicians such as Fela Kuti&#x27;s Afrobeat song &quot;Teacher Don&#x27;t Teach Me Nonsense&quot; and Prince Nico Mbarga&#x27;s highlife song &quot;Sweet Mother&quot;; both are from Nigeria. In Sierra Leone Krio the term refers to &#x27;child&#x27; or &#x27;children&#x27;, while in Liberian English the term &quot;pekin&quot; does likewise. In Chilapalapa, a pidgin language used in Southern Africa, the term used is . In Sranan Tongo and Ndyuka of Suriname the term may refer to &#x27;children&#x27; as well as to &#x27;small&#x27; or &#x27;little&#x27;. Some of these words may be more directly related to the Portuguese than to .

===United States===
In the Southern United States, &quot;pickaninny&quot; was long used to refer to the children of African slaves or (later) of any dark-skinned African American. The term is now generally considered offensive in the U.S.

The pickaninny became the dominant racial caricature of black children in the United States, and typically depicted untamed, genderless children with unkempt hair, bulging eyes, large mouths, and red lips, often stuffing their mouths with watermelon or fried chicken. The child was often depicted as being threatened or attacked by animals, and resistant or immune to pain. The first famous depiction of a pickaninny was the character of Topsy in Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s 1852 anti-slavery novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, presented as a poorly dressed and behaved, neglected girl, untamable and corrupted by slavery. These characters were a popular feature of minstrel shows into the twentieth century.

Journalist H. L. Mencken (born 1880) wrote that &quot;in the Baltimore of my youth, &quot;pickaninny&quot; was not used invidiously, but rather affectionately.&quot;

=== Commonwealth countries ===
&quot;Piccaninny&quot; is considered an offensive term for an Aboriginal Australian child. It was used in colonial Australia and is still in use in some Indigenous Kriol languages. 
&quot;Piccaninny&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;picanninnie&quot;) is found in numerous Australian place names, such as Piccaninnie Ponds and Piccaninny Lake in South Australia, Piccaninny crater and Picaninny Creek in Western Australia and Picaninny Point in Tasmania.

The term was used in 1831 in an anti-slavery tract &quot;The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave, related by herself&quot; published in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1826 an Englishman named Thomas Young was tried at the Old Bailey in London on a charge of enslaving and selling four Gabonese women known as &quot;Nura, Piccaninni, Jumbo Jack and Prince Quarben&quot;. &quot;The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English&quot; says that in the United Kingdom today, &quot;piccaninny&quot; is considered highly offensive and derogatory, or negative and judgemental when used by other black people. It was controversially used (&quot;wide-grinning picaninnies&quot;) by the British Conservative politician Enoch Powell in his 1968 &quot;Rivers of Blood&quot; speech. In a 2002 column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Boris Johnson wrote, &quot;It is said that the Queen has come to love the Commonwealth, partly because it supplies her with regular cheering crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies.&quot;

==In popular culture==


===Literature===
* 1911In the novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; by J. M. Barrie, the Indians of Neverland are members of the Piccaninny tribe. Writer Sarah Laskow describes them as &quot;a blanket stand-in for &#x27;others&#x27; of all stripes, from Aboriginal populations in Australia to descendants of slaves in the United States&quot; who generally communicate in pidgin with lines such as &quot;Ugh, ugh, wah!&quot;.
* 1936In Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s best-selling epic &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, the character Melanie Wilkes objects to her husband&#x27;s intended move to New York City because it would mean that their son Beau would be educated alongside &quot;Yankees&quot; and &quot;pickaninnies&quot;.

===Television===
* 2015Season 1 Episode 14 of &quot;Shark Tank Australia&quot; featured Piccaninny Tiny Tots which has since changed its name to Kakadu Tiny Tots.
* 2020Episode 8 (&quot;Jig-A-Bobo&quot;) of the HBO television series &quot;Lovecraft Country&quot; features a character chased by &quot;Topsy&quot; and &quot;Bopsy&quot;, two ghoulish monsters depicted as &quot;pickaninny&quot; caricatures.

<doc id="584052" wikidata="Q12976928" url="?curid=584052" title="Kitulgala">
<text>Kitulgala is a small town in the west of Sri Lanka. The Academy Award-winning &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; was filmed on the Kelani River near Kitulgala, although nothing remains now except the concrete foundations for the bridge. Kitulgala is also a base for white-water rafting, which starts a few kilometres upstream and also popular as a location for adventure based training programs.

==Features==

The Kelani river is wide at Kitulgala, but it is shallow apart from a deep channel near the opposite bank, so in the drier months it provides a safe and attractive place to swim, wash and play.

The river can be crossed by walking out across the shallows and crossing the deep channel in a dugout canoe, which is stabilised with an outrigger.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s most recently discovered bird, the Serendib scops owl was originally heard calling by Deepal Warakagoda in these forests.

The hills above the rubber plantations also have mountain hawk eagle, crested treeswift and Layard&#x27;s parakeet.

==Agriculture==
The agriculture around Kitulgala is typical of the hilly wet zone. The solitary fishtail palm, &quot;Caryota urens&quot;, which is called &quot;kitul&quot; in Sri Lanka, gives rise to the town&#x27;s name. Its sap is concentrated into a delicious syrup, not dissimilar to maple syrup, and crystallized as jaggery. It is also fermented to make palm wine. The pith is used to make sago, and the fibres to make rope.
Bananas of both red and yellow varieties are grown. The yellow bananas are only some 8 cm long, but are sweeter and tastier than the commercial strains available in the West. Rubber trees are also grown on the higher areas.

Many birders stay at Kitulgala. This area has most of the rainforest bird species that are found at the World Biosphere Reserve at Sinharaja, although in lower numbers. However, the secondary forest and cultivation at Kitulgala is more open than the pristine woodlands of Sinharaja, and elusive endemic species like Sri Lanka spurfowl, green-billed coucal and spot-winged thrush may be easier to see.

==Scene creation of the movie &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;==

&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is a 1957 British World War II film by David Lean based on the novel &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot; by French writer Pierre Boulle. The film is a work of fiction but borrows the construction of the Burma Railway in 1942–43 for its historical setting. It stars William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa. The scene creation of the film was done in Sri Lanka and many of them were at Kitulgala area including the bridge explosion.

<text>Tariq Ramadan (, ; born 26 August 1962) is a Swiss Muslim academic, philosopher and writer. He was a professor of contemporary Islamic studies at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford and the Faculty of Theology and Religion, University of Oxford, He is a senior research fellow at Doshisha University in Japan, and is also a visiting professor at the Université Mundiapolis in Morocco. He was a visiting professor at the Faculty of Islamic Studies at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, and used to be the director of the Research Centre of Islamic Legislation and Ethics (CILE), based in Doha. He is a member of the UK Foreign Office Advisory Group on Freedom of Religion or Belief. He was listed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2000 as one of the seven religious innovators of the 21st century and in 2004 as one of the 100 most influential people in the world and was voted by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; readers (2005, 2006, 2008–2010, 2012–2015) as one of the top 100 most influential thinkers in the world and Global Thinkers. Ramadan describes himself as a &quot;Salafi reformist&quot;.

In November 2017, Tariq Ramadan took leave of absence from Oxford to contest allegations of rape and sexual misconduct. The university&#x27;s statement noted that an &quot;agreed leave of absence implies no acceptance or presumption of guilt&quot;, and in 2021 he took early retirement from Oxford on grounds of ill health. In February 2018, he was formally charged with raping two women: a disabled woman in 2009 and a feminist activist in 2012. In September 2019, the French authorities expanded the investigation against Ramadan, already charged with raping two women, to include evidence from two more alleged victims. On 5 December 2019, a Swiss woman who had accused him of rape in 2018, launched a new case against him for slander. The charges have not come to a full conclusion yet, but he was acquitted of one charge in May 2023. In February 2020, Ramadan was formally charged with raping two more women and in October 2020, Ramadan was formally charged with raping a fifth woman. In September 2024 he was convicted by a Swiss court on one charge of rape.

== Life and career ==

Tariq Ramadan was born in Geneva, Switzerland on 26 August 1962 to an Egyptian Muslim family. He is the son of Said Ramadan and Wafa al-Banna, who was the eldest daughter of Hassan al Banna, who in 1928 founded the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt. Gamal al-Banna, the liberal Muslim reformer, was his great-uncle. His father was a prominent figure in the Muslim Brotherhood and was exiled by Gamal Abdel Nasser from Egypt to Switzerland, where Ramadan was born.

Tariq Ramadan holds an M.A. in French literature and a PhD in Arabic and Islamic studies at the University of Geneva. He also wrote a PhD dissertation on Friedrich Nietzsche, titled &quot;Nietzsche as a Historian of Philosophy.&quot;

In 1994, he addressed a French-speaking public audience, in Switzerland, with the help of Hassan Iquioussen and Malika Dif.

He taught at the Collège de Saussure, a high school in Lancy, Switzerland, and claims to have held a lectureship in Religion and Philosophy at the University of Fribourg from 1996 to 2003, something the university publicly denied in 2018. He was appointed a professor at the University of Notre Dame in the United States in 2004 before his visa had been revoked by the Bush administration because of the Patriot Act. In October 2005 he began teaching at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford, on a visiting fellowship. In 2005 he was a senior research fellow at the Lokahi Foundation.

In 2007 he successfully applied for the professorship in Islamic studies at the University of Leiden. This led to severe criticism from both academics as well as politicians who deemed Ramadan a &#x27;radical Islamist&#x27; and a &#x27;wolf in sheep&#x27;s clothing&#x27;. Ramadan later turned down the appointment, stating that the criticism on his appointment played no role in this decision. He was also a guest professor of Identity and Citizenship at Erasmus University Rotterdam,
until August 2009 when both the City of Rotterdam and Erasmus University dismissed him from his positions as &quot;integration adviser&quot; and professor, stating that the program he hosted on Iran&#x27;s Press TV, &quot;Islam &amp; Life&quot;, was &quot;irreconcilable&quot; with his duties in Rotterdam. Ramadan described this move as &#x27;Islamophobic&#x27; and &#x27;politically charged&#x27;. In 2012 the Court of Rotterdam District ruled in a civil law case that the Erasmus University acted &quot;carelessly&quot; by dismissing Ramadan at short notice. The dismissal by the municipality of Rotterdam, however, was not careless according to the Court.

Beginning September 2009, Ramadan was appointed to the chair in Contemporary Islamic Studies at Oxford University.

Ramadan established the &quot;Mouvement des Musulmans Suisses&quot; (Movement of Swiss Muslims), which engages in various interfaith seminars. He is an advisor to the EU on religious issues and was sought for advice by the EU on a commission on &quot;Islam and Secularism&quot;. In September 2005 he was invited to join a task force by the government of the United Kingdom. He is also the founder and President of the European Muslim Network, a Brussels-based think-tank that gathers European Muslim intellectuals and activists.

As of 2009, Tariq Ramadan was persona non grata in Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Libya, and Syria, which he has said is because of his criticism of their &quot;undemocratic regimes&quot;. He is also considered persona non grata in Israel.

=== Family life ===
Tariq Ramadan married in 1986 and is the father of four children. His wife was born in Bretagne, France. She converted from Catholicism to Islam and adopted the name Iman. The couple live separately.

== U.S. visa revocation and subsequent lifting ==
In February 2004, Tariq Ramadan accepted the tenured position of Henry R. Luce Professor of Religion, Conflict and Peacebuilding at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, at the University of Notre Dame. He was granted a nonimmigrant visa on 5 May; however, on 28 July, his H-1B visa was revoked by the State Department. In August 2004, spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cited the &quot;ideological exclusion provision&quot; of the U.S. Patriot Act as the grounds for Ramadan&#x27;s visa revocation. In October, the University of Notre Dame filed an H-1B petition on Ramadan&#x27;s behalf. After hearing no response from the government by December, Ramadan resigned his position from the university.

In September 2005, Ramadan filed an application for a B Visa to allow him to participate at speaking arrangements with various organizations and universities. The government did not issue a decision on Ramadan&#x27;s visa application, so the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on 25 January 2006 against the United States government on behalf of the American Academy of Religion, the American Association of University Professors and the PEN American Center – three groups who had planned on meeting with Ramadan in the US – for revoking Ramadan&#x27;s visa under the &quot;ideological exclusion provision&quot;. The ACLU and NYCLU argued that the ideological exclusion provision was in violation of the First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights of those three groups and that the government&#x27;s actions violated the Administrative Procedures Act. After two months had passed without a decision being made, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Pursuant to the injunction, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the government on 23 June 2006 to issue its decision on Ramadan&#x27;s pending B Visa application within 90 days.

On 19 September 2006, the government formally denied Ramadan&#x27;s visa application. A State Department statement said: &quot;A U.S. consular officer has denied Dr. Tariq Ramadan&#x27;s visa application. The consular officer concluded that Dr. Ramadan was inadmissible based solely on his actions, which constituted providing material support to a terrorist organization.&quot; Between December 1998 and July 2002, Ramadan had given donations totalling $940 to two charity organizations, the Committee for Charity and Support for the Palestinians (CBSP) or &quot;Comité de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens&quot; and the &quot;Association de Secours Palestinien&quot;. The United States Treasury designated both the CBSP and ASP terrorist fundraising organizations for their alleged links to Hamas on 22 August 2003. The U.S. Embassy told Ramadan that he &quot;reasonably should have known&quot; that the charities provided money to Hamas. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Ramadan asked: &quot;How should I reasonably have known of their activities before the U.S. government itself knew?&quot;

On 2 February 2007, the ACLU and NYCLU amended their complaint, arguing that the government&#x27;s explanation for denying Ramadan&#x27;s visa application was not &quot;facially legitimate and bona fide&quot; and that the ideological exclusion provision of the PATRIOT Act was in violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. They also argued that Ramadan&#x27;s denial violated the First Amendment rights of those who wanted to hear him speak. In his decision on 20 December 2007, District Judge Paul A. Crotty ruled that the government&#x27;s justification for denying Ramadan&#x27;s visa was &quot;facially legitimate and bona fide&quot; and noted that the Court &quot;has no authority to override the Government&#x27;s consular decision&quot;.

In January 2008, the ACLU appealed Crotty&#x27;s ruling. Jameel Jaffer, Director of the ACLU National Security Project and lead attorney in the case, stated:
&quot;The government&#x27;s shifting positions only underscore why meaningful judicial review – the kind of oversight that the district court failed to provide – is so important. In Professor Ramadan&#x27;s case and many others, the government is using immigration laws to stigmatize and exclude its critics and to censor and control the ideas that Americans can hear. Censorship of this kind is completely inconsistent with the most basic principles of an open society.&quot;
Ramadan himself remarked:
&quot;The U.S. government&#x27;s actions in my case seem, at least to me, to have been arbitrary and myopic. But I am encouraged by the unwavering support I have received from ordinary Americans, civic groups and particularly from scholars, academic organizations, and the ACLU. I am heartened by the emerging debate in the U.S. about what has been happening to our countries and ideals in the past six years. And I am hopeful that eventually I will be allowed to enter the country so that I may contribute to the debate and be enriched by dialogue.&quot;

On 17 July 2009, the US federal appeals court reversed the ruling of the lower district court. The three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit – composed of Judges Jon O. Newman, Wilfred Feinberg and Reena Raggi – ruled that the Court had &quot;jurisdiction to consider the claim, despite the doctrine of consular nonreviewability&quot;. They stated that government was required by law to &quot;confront Ramadan with the allegation against him and afford him the subsequent opportunity to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know, and reasonably should not have known, that the recipient of his contributions was a terrorist organization.&quot; Under the limited review permitted by the 1972 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Kleindienst v. Mandel&quot;, the panel concluded that the &quot;record does not establish that the consular officer who denied the visa confronted Ramadan with the allegation that he had knowingly rendered material support to a terrorist organization, thereby precluding an adequate opportunity for Ramadan to attempt to satisfy the provision that exempts a visa applicant from exclusion under the &#x27;material support&#x27; subsection if he &#x27;can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that [he] did not know, and should not reasonably have known, that the organization was a terrorist organization.&#x27;&quot; Additionally, the panel agreed with the plaintiffs&#x27; contention that their First Amendment rights had been violated. The panel remanded the case to a lower court to determine if the consular officer had confronted Ramadan with the &quot;allegation that he knew that ASP provided funds to Hamas and then providing him with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that he did not know, and should not have reasonably known, of that fact.&quot;

Following the ruling, Ramadan stated, &quot;I am very gratified with the court&#x27;s decision. I am eager to engage once again with Americans in the kinds of face-to-face discussions that are central to academic exchange and crucial to bridging cultural divides.&quot; Melissa Goodman, staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project, issued a statement saying, &quot;Given today&#x27;s decision, we hope that the Obama administration will immediately end Professor Ramadan&#x27;s exclusion. We also encourage the new administration to reconsider the exclusion of other foreign scholars, writers and artists who were barred from the country by the Bush administration on ideological grounds.&quot;

On 8 April 2010, Ramadan spoke as part of a panel discussion at the Great Hall of Cooper Union in New York City, his first public appearance since the State Department lifted the ban. The group debated the lengths to which Western nations should go to accommodate their Muslim populations.

== Views ==
Ramadan works primarily on Islamic theology and the position of Muslims in the West and within Muslim majority countries. Generally speaking, he prioritizes Qur&#x27;anic interpretation over simply reading the text, in order to understand its meaning and to practice the tenets of Islamic philosophy. Referring to himself, Ramadan has at times used the construction &quot;Salafi Reformist&quot; to illustrate his stance.

He rejects a binary division of the world into &quot;dar al-Islam&quot; (the abode of Islam) and &quot;dar al-harb&quot; (the abode of war), on the grounds that such a division is not mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an. He has been also known to favourably cite &quot;dar al-da‘wah&quot; (the abode of preaching).

For him the &quot;Islamic message&quot; to which Muslims are expected to bear witness is not primarily the particularist, socially conservative code of traditionalist jurists, but a commitment to universalism and the welfare of non-Muslims; it is also an injunction not merely to make demands on un-Islamic societies but to express solidarity with them.

Ramadan has voiced his opposition to all forms of capital punishment but believes the Muslim world should remove such laws from within, without any Western pressure, as such would only further alienate Muslims, and instead bolster the position of those who support hudud punishments: &quot;Muslim populations are convincing themselves of the Islamic character of these practices through a rejection of the west, on the basis of a simplistic reasoning that stipulates that &#x27;the less western, the more Islamic&#x27;&quot;.

He has condemned suicide bombing and violence as a tactic. Additionally, he contends that terrorism is never justifiable, even though it can be understandable (in the sense of having a legitimate cause of resistance behind it).

Ramadan wrote that the Muslim response to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s speech on Islam was disproportionate, and was encouraged by reactionary Islamic regimes in order to distract their populations, and that it did not improve the position of Islam in the world.

Ramadan wrote an article, &quot;Critique des (nouveaux) intellectuels communautaires&quot;, which French newspapers &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; refused to publish. Oumma.com did eventually publish it. In the article he criticizes a number of French intellectuals and figures such as Alexandre Adler, Alain Finkielkraut, Bernard-Henri Lévy, André Glucksmann and Bernard Kouchner, for allegedly abandoning universal human rights, and giving special status to the defence of Israel. Ramadan was accused, in return, of having used inflammatory language. The underlying content of the essay was sharply criticized as well.

=== Debate ===
In a French television debate in 2003 with Nicolas Sarkozy, Sarkozy accused Ramadan of defending the stoning of adulterers, a punishment supposedly warranted by a section of the Islamic penal code known as hudud. Ramadan replied that Sarkozy was wrong. He said that he opposed corporal punishments, stoning and the death penalty and that he is in favor of a moratorium on these practices to open the debate among Islamic scholars in Muslim-majority countries that enforce them. Many people, including Sarkozy, were outraged. Ramadan later defended his position arguing that, because it involved religious texts that Muslims take seriously, the law would have to be properly understood and contextualized. Ramadan argued that in Muslim countries, the simple act to &quot;condemn&quot; will not change anything, but with a moratorium, it could open the way for further debate. He thinks that such a debate can only lead to an abolition of these rules.

In October 2007, Warraq participated in an Intelligence Squared debate &quot;We Should Not Be Reluctant to Assert the Superiority of Western Values,&quot; where he argued for the opposition viewpoint, together with William Dalrymple, and Charles Glass.

In October 2010, he debated with Christopher Hitchens as to whether Islam was a religion of peace.

=== Mauritania ban ===
On 16 July 2016, Ramadan was denied entry to Mauritania at Nouakchott International Airport. He had been invited to give lectures in the country. He claimed the decision &quot;came directly from the presidency&quot;. Local police confirmed he &quot;was expelled&quot;. This is the eighth time a Muslim country has denied him entry.

== Critical reception ==
Some academics have detected liberalising and rationalising tendencies.

=== Praise ===
Paul Donnelly in 2001 asked rhetorically: &quot;Tariq Ramadan: The Muslim Martin Luther?&quot; Similarly, an article at the self-described liberal &quot;The American Prospect&quot; praised Ramadan and his work in particular as an &quot;entire corpus consists of a steady and unyielding assault on Muslim insularity, self-righteousness, and self-pity.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
In her book, &quot;Frère Tariq&quot;, (Encounter Books), Caroline Fourest claimed to have analysed Tariq Ramadan&#x27;s 15 books, 1,500 pages of interviews, and approximately 100 recordings, and concludes &quot;Ramadan is a war leader&quot;, an &quot;Islamist&quot; and the &quot;political heir of his grandfather&quot;, Hassan al-Banna, stating that his discourse is &quot;often just a repetition of the discourse that Banna had at the beginning of the 20th century in Egypt&quot;, and that he &quot;presents [al-Banna] as a model to be followed.&quot; She argues that &quot;Tariq Ramadan is slippery. He says one thing to his faithful Muslim followers and something else entirely to his Western audience. His choice of words, the formulations he uses – even his tone of voice – vary, chameleon-like, according to his audience.&quot;

The former head of the French antiracism organization SOS Racisme, Malek Boutih, has been quoted as saying to Ramadan, after talking with him at length: &quot;Mr. Ramadan, you are a fascist&quot;. In an interview with Europe 1, Malek Boutih also likened Ramadan to &quot;a small Le Pen&quot;; in another interview he accused him of having crossed the line of racism and antisemitism, thus not genuinely belonging to the alter-globalization movement. Bertrand Delanoë, mayor of Paris, declared Ramadan unfit to participate at the European Social Forum, as not even &quot;a slight suspicion of anti-Semitism&quot; would be tolerable. Talking to the Paris weekly &quot;Marianne&quot;, Fadela Amara, president of &quot;Ni Putes Ni Soumises&quot; (Neither Whores Nor Submissive, a French feminist movement), Aurélie Filippetti, municipal counsellor for The Greens in Paris, Patrick Klugman, leading member of the Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France, and Dominique Sopo, head of SOS Racisme, accuse Ramadan of having misused the alter-globalization movement&#x27;s ingenuousness to advance his &quot;radicalism and anti-Semitism.&quot; Other criticisms have included allegations that an essay attacking French intellectuals was antisemitic and that Ramadan has shown excessive generosity in his rationalization of the motives behind acts of terrorism, such as in the case of Mohammed Merah.

Olivier Guitta, writing in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, welcomed the U.S. decision to refuse Ramadan a visa, based on Ramadan&#x27;s supposed links to terrorist organizations, and claiming that his father was the likely author of &quot;&#x27;The Project&#x27;... a roadmap for installing Islamic regimes in the West by propaganda, preaching, and if necessary war.&quot; Guitta also criticized Ramadan for his campaign against the performance of Voltaire&#x27;s play &quot;Mahomet&quot; in Geneva. After the lifting of the visa revocation, an article in the &quot;National Review&quot; criticized the double standard of lifting the visa restriction on Ramadan, but not for Issam Abu Issa who was banned by the Bush administration for being a whistleblower against the Palestinian Authority&#x27;s corruption.

==== Response to some of the criticism ====

Ramadan denies contacts with terrorists or other Islamic fundamentalists and the charges of antisemitism and double talk, attributing the charges to misinterpretation and an unfamiliarity with his writings. He stated: &quot;I have often been accused of this &#x27;double discourse&#x27;, and to those who say it, I say – bring the evidence. I am quite clear in what I say. The problem is that many people don&#x27;t want to hear it, particularly in the media. Most of the stories about me are completely untrue: journalists simply repeat black propaganda from the internet without any corroboration, and it just confirms what they want to believe. Words are used out of context. There is double-talk, yes, but there is also double-hearing. That is what I want to challenge.&quot; In answer to criticism of his response to 11 September, Ramadan replied that two days after the attacks he had published an open letter, exhorting Muslims to condemn the attacks and the attackers, and not to &quot;hide behind conspiracy theories.&quot; and that less than two weeks after the attacks he had stated that &quot;The probability [of bin Laden&#x27;s guilt] is large, but some questions remain unanswered. ... But whoever they are, Bin Laden or others, it is necessary to find them and that they be judged&quot;, and that the interview had been conducted before any evidence was publicly available.

==== Public reception ====
In a free internet poll by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, Ramadan was listed as one of the 100 top global thinkers in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012.

== Allegations of rape and sexual violation ==
In October 2017, secular activist Henda Ayari filed a complaint with the prosecutor&#x27;s office of Rouen, stating that Ramadan had sexually assaulted her in a Paris hotel. Ayari had previously described the alleged incident in her 2016 book &quot;J’ai choisi d’être libre&quot; (in English &quot;I Chose to be Free&quot;), but had not revealed the real name of her attacker.

Ramadan&#x27;s lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou, has said he would file a counter-suit for defamation. Bouzrou told the French paper &quot;Le Parisien&quot; that he denied the allegations and would file a complaint for defamation to Rouen prosecutors.

A few days after Ayari, a second woman filed a complaint stating that Ramadan raped her. The disabled 45-year-old French convert to Islam, known in media reports as &quot;Christelle&quot;, says Ramadan in 2009 lured her into his hotel room where he assaulted and raped her. A third woman claimed Ramadan had sent her &quot;pornographic&quot; messages and later tried to blackmail and manipulate her.

Four other Swiss women subsequently came forth in early November 2017 with allegations that Ramadan molested them when they were teenagers. The claimants include one woman who says that Ramadan made advances when she was 14 years old, and another who claims she had sexual relations with Ramadan when she was 15. Ramadan has denied the accusations.

On 4 November 2017, the satirical French newspaper &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; published a cover story on the Ramadan affair. On 7 November 2017, the University of Oxford announced that, &quot;by mutual agreement, and with immediate effect&quot; Ramadan &quot;has taken a leave of absence&quot;. The statement noted that an &quot;agreed leave of absence implies no acceptance or presumption of guilt&quot;. On 9 November 2017, the French weekly news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Obs&quot; published a cover story covering the allegations. In January 2018, Ramadan was denied entry to Qatar as a consequence of the scandal.

On 31 January 2018, Ramadan was taken into custody by French police. After two days of questioning, he was formally charged with two counts of rape and ordered to remain in custody. He was held in the Fleury-Mérogis prison, Essonne.

In March 2018, a third woman came forward alleging that she was raped by Ramadan on multiple occasions in France, Brussels and London between 2013 and 2014. Shortly thereafter, a fourth woman filed a police complaint alleging she had been raped by Ramadan. An American now living in Kuwait, she alleged that Ramadan had assaulted her in Washington DC in August 2013. No charges emerged from this complaint.

In April 2018, the Belgian judiciary reported that Ramadan had paid €27,000 three years earlier to a Belgian-Moroccan woman in exchange for the deletion of online posts revealing their affair. In the posts, she had detailed Ramadan&#x27;s alleged &quot;psychological grip&quot; on her.

On 13 April 2018, the Swiss newspaper &quot;La Tribune de Genève&quot; reported that a woman had come forward to the authorities in Geneva and accused Ramadan of a sexual assault involving aggravating cruelty in September 2008. &quot;The National&quot; reported that he allegedly &quot;raped her and held her against her will for several hours in a Geneva hotel room&quot;.

Later in April 2018, Ramadan admitted that he had been in a sexual relationship with the third rape complainant, who had presented to investigators a dress reportedly stained with his semen, but he insisted that it was always consensual.

In May 2018, Ayari modified aspects of her account, according to her based on her diary records, saying that the encounter took place in March 2012 at the Crown Plaza hotel in Paris&#x27; Place de la Republique.

In a newspaper blog, British journalist Peter Oborne criticized what he saw as failings in the French justice system and hypocrisy of prominent French public figures such as Manuel Valls pointing out that others accused of rape in France &quot;await their fate in freedom&quot;. Regarding such sympathy for Ramadan over his detention, Henda Ayari, the first of his accusers, said that he is undeserving of sympathy. &quot;It is for the courts to decide,&quot; she said. &quot;Eventually, if French justice says he is guilty, those people may regret their support.&quot;

In June, Ramadan admitted to having five extramarital affairs, saying that he sometimes acted in ways that were inconsistent with his principles. In that same month, the presiding judges also cleared him of the third accusation, because it had been a consensual extramarital affair, and he remains imprisoned for the first two.

In July, it was revealed that the first accuser, Henda Ayari, was at her younger brother&#x27;s wedding on the date when she was allegedly raped.

In October, Ramadan admitted that he had consensual sex with Ayari and &quot;Christelle&quot;.

In August 2019, Ramadan faced a new accusation of raping a woman in May 2014 in Lyon, France.

In September 2019, Ramadan stated that the allegations from the women, the indictment for the rape, the jail custody, and the media coverage of the case against him were &quot;state racism&quot;, and compared his own case with the Dreyfus affair. He stated: &quot;Is there not a similarity between Dreyfus affair and Ramadan affair? Nobody can deny the anti-Muslim racism that has grown in this country [France] and which is sustained daily by the politicians and the journalists. Dreyfus who was Jew yesterday is Muslim today&quot;. This comparison caused indignation among both French and also Muslim communities. Among others the editor Laurent Joffrin, in his Libération, labelled Ramadan&#x27;s comparison as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and pointed out: &quot;Dreyfus was innocently convicted by false evidence and sent to the prison house. Ramadan is prosecuted but not convicted, and if he gets convicted, then it would be because of the evidence, not because of his religion&quot;.

In February 2020, Ramadan was formally charged with raping two more women.

In May 2023, Ramadan was acquitted by a Swiss court on all charges in relation to a singular allegation of rape and sexual coercion against a woman in a Geneva hotel room. Nevertheless, this acquittal was reversed in September 2024 by a Swiss appeals court. He received a three-year prison sentence, with two years suspended. Ramadan still faces multiple other rape allegations in both Switzerland and France, which he continues to deny, asserting the charges are politically driven.

=== Declining health ===

Since his initial detention, Ramadan has been hospitalized several times for multiple sclerosis. His attorney reported that several doctors have said his condition is &quot;incompatible with detention&quot;; however, the court insisted on maintaining his detention after multiple hospital exams and medical consultations indicated that his condition was compatible with detention.

== Bibliography ==
Ramadan has authored around 30 books as well as &quot;several hundred articles&quot; in French and English, some of which have been translated into other languages.

<doc id="584072" wikidata="Q5259104" url="?curid=584072" title="Dennis the Menace Annual">
<text>The Dennis the Menace Annual (sometimes called the Dennis the Menace and Gnasher Annual and later called the Dennis and Gnasher Annual) was the name of the book that was published between 1955 and 2011 to tie in with the children&#x27;s comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, specifically the Dennis the Menace comic strip. Since they are traditionally published in the northern autumn and in time for Christmas, since 1965 (with the release of Dennis the Menace 1966) they have had the date of the following year on the cover. Before then no date was given. Until the 2009 edition, the annuals mainly featured reprints from around 14–15 years ago from the cover date of Dennis the Menace, Gnasher and Gnipper and formerly Gnasher&#x27;s Tale and Rasher strips in &quot;The Beano&quot;, although there is some new material. The 2010 and 2011 editions contained all new material based on the updated style seen in the CBBC series.

Originally a new annual was published every two years. However, after the 1987 annual was published it was decided to make the annual a yearly publication instead. The next annual was published the following year and the others every year onwards since then.

The original title was simply &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; with the year added at the end later on. This name continued, the year changing for each different annual, until the release of the 1978 book. There was then a short break until the next annual was published in 1982 (for &#x27;83). From then on the words &quot;from The Beano&quot; were printed elsewhere on the cover, the same thing The Bash Street Kids Annual had been doing for a few years earlier.

The name has had various suffixes since then, including &quot;and Gnasher&quot; on the 1988, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1997, 2007, 2008 and 2009 books, and &quot;Book&quot; on the 1991, 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2002 editions. The annual permanently changed its name to &quot;Dennis the Menace Annual&quot; from the 2003 book, though the following year and &quot;from The Beano&quot; still appear. The 2010 edition was renamed the &quot;Dennis &amp; Gnasher Annual&quot; to tie into the CBBC cartoon. It now says &quot;as seen on CBBC&quot; instead of &quot;from The Beano&quot;.
There was no 2012 annual.

The information below dates older annuals which were without publication dates. Annuals were published the autumn before with the 1956 annual published Autumn 1955. Prices are in shillings and (old) pence with one shilling equal to 5p.

* 1956. Large picture of Dennis holding tin of paint. Price 5/-
* 1958. Dennis travelling down hill on a go-cart, knocking over a policeman, a chimney sweep and a painter. Price 5/6

==History==
The council was formed as the Asian Cricket Conference in New Delhi, India, on 19 September 1983, with the original members being Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, and Sri Lanka. Changing its name to the present in 1995. Until 2003, the headquarters of the council were rotated biennially amongst the presidents&#x27; and secretaries&#x27; home countries. The organization&#x27;s current president is Jay Shah, who is also the Secretary of the BCCI.

The council runs a development program that supports coaching, umpiring and sports medicine programs in member countries, funded from television revenues collected during the officially sanctioned Asian Cricket Council tournaments including the Asia Cup, Under-19 Asia Cup, Women&#x27;s Asia Cup and various other tournaments.

Previously ACC was headquartered in Colombo, Sri Lanka, which was officially opened on 20 August 2016. In 2019, the headquarters of the ACC was moved to Dubai, near the International Cricket Council (ICC) office.

*Due to World War II, there were no issues from 6 April 1941 to 28 October 1944

===Reporting during the Yugoslav Wars===

In the run-up to and during the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars, was under the control of Slobodan Milošević and the League of Communists of Serbia and was used for political purposes. It was used to publish controversial things such as the &quot;Vojko i Savle&quot; article, as well as an information guide to show what was allegedly happening to the Serbs in other republics, together with the Radio Television of Serbia. It blamed the local Kosovo Albanians for sodomizing Đorđe Martinović, and published fabricated reader letters claiming that the Albanians were &quot;raping hundreds of Serbian women&quot;. Before and during the Croatian War of Independence, it published opinions on how &quot;blood may shed again&quot; in Croatia because of World War II, published claims on how the Vatican funded Croatia to break up Yugoslavia. At the end of the Battle of Vukovar, it ran the fabricated story of the Vukovar children massacre. The article was however retracted with a statement published the following day.

<text>Amr Mohamed Helmi Khaled (; born: 5 September 1967) is an Egyptian Muslim activist and television preacher. &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, in reference to Khaled&#x27;s popularity in English-speaking countries, described him in 2006 issue as &quot;the world&#x27;s most famous and influential Muslim television preacher.&quot; In 2007, Amr Khaled was chosen as one of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. His message appeals to a large number of Muslims who want an easy way to understand Islam.

==Early days==
Amr Khaled was born in Alexandria, Egypt, on 5 September 1967. He graduated from Cairo University in 1988 with a degree in accounting. In 2001, he received a diploma from an Islamic studies institute. He received his Ph.D. at the University of Wales, Lampeter, in May 2010 with a grade of A. He began preaching in mosques in 1990 while still working as an accountant. In 1998, he moved to full-time preaching, primarily on satellite television. Khaled&#x27;s popular lectures, which can be seen on the Iqraa TV channel via the Nilesat direct broadcast satellites, are also distributed over the Internet and on audio and video cassette tapes.

==Ministry and audience==
Amr Khaled rejects extremism and strongly denounces the actions of Osama bin Laden. He announced that Arab Muslims want to live peacefully in coexistence with the West. His main teachings remain the same as those before him in more modern media, talking about everyday actions to get closer to Allah such as honesty, humbleness, and being polite. He believes that for society to improve it must change from the grassroots (from the bottom up).
Khaled promotes community development in the Arabic and Muslim nation based on what he terms &quot;Faith Based Development&quot; (Arabic: التنمية بالإيمان). The idea is for people to develop their communities and countries with faith as their motivator and guide.

Khaled&#x27;s primary audience consists of Arabs ages fifteen through thirty-five. Khaled believes these are the ones most capable of changing the Islamic world. He is noted for his natural everyday language and his friendly approach, even joking at times during his lectures.

In 2008, in an open online poll, Khaled was voted the 6th topmost intellectual person in the world on the list of top 100 public intellectuals by &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine (UK) and &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (United States).

==Shows==
Khaled has many shows which were aired on TV in the holy month of Ramadan:

* &quot;Call for Coexistence&quot; (Arabic: دعوة للتعايش) in 2007.
* &quot;Life Makers&quot; (Arabic: صناع الحياة) aired from 2004 to 2005.
* &quot;On the Path of the Beloved&quot; (Arabic: على خطى الحبيب) for Ramadan in 2005 in which he discussed the hagiography (&quot;sira&quot;) of Muhammad.
* &quot;In Thy Name We Live&quot; (Arabic: باسمك نحيا) for 2006, aired live at 7:30 GMT every night from Mecca in Saudi Arabia, about the names of God in the Qur&#x27;an.
* &quot;Qur&#x27;an Stories&quot; (Arabic: قصص القرآن) for 2008.
* &quot;Tomorrow is Better&quot; (Arabic: بكرا أحلى) for 2011. In this show he is on the streets of Cairo.
* &quot;Journey to Happiness&quot; (Arabic: رحلة للسعادة) for 2011.
* &quot;Omar: The Maker of Civilization&quot; (Arabic: عمر صانع حضارة) for 2012. He spoke about the second caliph, Umar ibn Al-Khattab.
* Qisat Al Andalus &quot;The Story of Andalusia&quot;

In December 2010, Khaled was invited by Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh to preach and broadcast in Yemen, to counter the growth of Al-Qaeda and other extremist groups in the country causing chronic instability there.

== Criticism ==
Critics have called his approach &quot;air-conditioned Islam&quot;, where hijab is a fashion purchase and televangelists talk about personal success and getting rich, more akin to Joel Osteen and Billy Graham than traditional Islam. Many scholars, including Yusuf al-Qaradawi, have questioned whether he possesses appropriate qualifications to be a preacher.

The British &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported on 30 May 2004, that Andrew Turnbull, the cabinet secretary and one of Tony Blair&#x27;s closest aides, intended to seek Amr Khaled&#x27;s aid in furthering the British government&#x27;s agenda regarding Muslims.
He is also criticized for the significant amount of money he makes from his television shows. His annual income in 2007 is estimated to be $2,500,000.

== Politics ==
After the 25 January 2011 revolution in Egypt, Amr Khaled shared in establishing a political party called the Egypt Party and was elected as its president; however, he resigned one day after the 2013 Egyptian coup d&#x27;état.
==Bibliography==
Books by Amr Khaled include:
* &quot;Rafi Barakat&quot;, 2014 novel.

<text>Myriapods () are the members of subphylum Myriapoda, containing arthropods such as millipedes and centipedes. The group contains about 13,000 species, all of them terrestrial.

Although molecular evidence and similar fossils suggests a diversification in the Cambrian Period, the oldest known fossil record of myriapods dates between the Late Silurian and Early Devonian, with &quot;Pneumodesmus&quot; preserving the earliest known evidence of air-breathing on land. Other early myriapod fossil species around the similar time period include &quot;Kampecaris obanensis&quot; and &quot;Archidesmus&quot; sp. The phylogenetic classification of myriapods is still debated.

The scientific study of myriapods is myriapodology, and those who study myriapods are myriapodologists.

==Anatomy==

Myriapods have a single pair of antennae and, in most cases, simple eyes. Exceptions are the two classes of symphylans and pauropods, the millipede order Polydesmida and the centipede order Geophilomorpha, which are all eyeless. The house centipedes (Scutigera) on the other hand, have large and well-developed compound eyes. The mouthparts lie on the underside of the head, with an &quot;epistome&quot; and labrum forming the upper lip, and a pair of maxillae forming the lower lip. A pair of mandibles lie inside the mouth. Myriapods breathe through spiracles that connect to a tracheal system similar to that of insects. There is a long tubular heart that extends through much of the body, but usually few, if any, blood vessels.

Malpighian tubules excrete nitrogenous waste into the digestive system, which typically consists of a simple tube. Although the ventral nerve cord has a ganglion in each segment, the brain is relatively poorly developed.

During mating, male myriapods produce a packet of sperm, or spermatophore, which they must transfer to the female externally; this process is often complex and highly developed. The female lays eggs which hatch as much-shortened versions of the adults, with only a few segments and as few as three pairs of legs. With the exception of the two centipede orders Scolopendromorpha and Geophilomorpha, which have epimorphic development (all body segments are formed segments embryonically), the young add additional segments and limbs as they repeatedly moult to reach the adult form.

The process of adding new segments during postembryonic growth is known as anamorphosis, of which there are three types: euanamorphosis, emianamorphosis, and teloanamorphosis. In euanamorphosis, every moult is followed by addition of new segments, even after reaching sexual maturity; in emianamorphosis, new segments are added until a certain stage, and further moults happen without addition of segments; and in teloanamorphosis, where the addition of new segments stops after the adult form is reached, after no further moults occur.

==Ecology==

Myriapods are most abundant in moist forests, where they fulfill an important role in breaking down decaying plant material, although a few live in grasslands, semi-arid habitats or even deserts. A very small percentage of species are littoral (found along the sea shore). The majority are detritivorous, with the exception of centipedes, which are chiefly nocturnal predators. 

A few species of centipedes and millipedes are able to produce light and are therefore bioluminescent. Pauropodans and symphylans are small, sometimes microscopic animals that resemble centipedes superficially and live in soils. Millipedes differ from the other groups in having their body segments fused into pairs, giving the appearance that each segment bears two pairs of legs, while the other three groups have a single pair of legs on each body segment.

Although not generally considered dangerous to humans, many millipedes produce noxious secretions (often containing benzoquinones) which in rare cases can cause temporary blistering and discolouration of the skin. Large centipedes, however, can bite humans, and although the bite may cause intense pain and discomfort, fatalities are extremely rare.

==Classification==
There has been much debate as to which arthropod group is most closely related to the Myriapoda. Under the Mandibulata hypothesis, Myriapoda is the sister taxon to Pancrustacea, a group comprising the Crustacea and Hexapoda (insects and their close relatives). Under the Atelocerata hypothesis, Hexapoda is the closest, whereas under the Paradoxopoda hypothesis, Chelicerata is the closest. This last hypothesis, although supported by few, if any, morphological characters, is supported by a number of molecular studies.
A 2020 study found numerous characters of the eye and preoral region suggesting that the closest relatives to crown myriapods are the extinct Euthycarcinoids. There are four classes of extant myriapods, Chilopoda (centipedes), Diplopoda, Pauropoda and Symphyla, containing a total of around 12,000 species. While each of these groups of myriapods is believed to be monophyletic, relationships among them are less certain.

===Centipedes===

Centipedes make up the class Chilopoda. They are fast, predatory and venomous, hunting mostly at night. There are around 3,300 species, ranging from the diminutive &quot;Nannarrup hoffmani&quot; (less than 12 mm or  in in length) to the giant &quot;Scolopendra gigantea&quot;, which may exceed .

===Millipedes===

Millipedes form the class Diplopoda. Most millipedes are slower than centipedes, and feed on leaf litter and detritus. Except for the first segment called collum, which don&#x27;t have any appendages, and the next three segments with a single pair of legs each, they are distinguished by the fusion of each pair of body segments into a single unit, giving the appearance of having two pairs of legs per segment. It is also common for the sternites, pleurites and tergites to fuse into rigid armour rings. The males produce aflagellate sperm cells, unlike the rest of the myriapods which produce flagellated sperm. Around 12,000 species have been described, which may represent less than a tenth of the true global millipede diversity. Although the name &quot;millipede&quot; is a compound word formed from the Latin roots &quot;millia&quot; (&quot;thousand&quot;) and &quot;pes&quot; (gen. &quot;pedis&quot;) (&quot;foot&quot;), millipedes typically have between 36 and 400 legs. In 2021, however, was described &quot;Eumillipes persephone,&quot; the first species known to have 1,000 or more legs, possessing 1,306 of them. Pill millipedes are much shorter, and are capable of rolling up into a ball, like pillbugs.

===Symphyla===
Symphylans, or garden centipedes, are closely related to centipedes and millipedes. They are 3 to 6 cm long, and have 6 to 12 pairs of legs, depending on their life stage. Their eggs, which are white and spherical and covered with small hexagonal ridges, are laid in batches of 4 to 25 at a time, and usually take up to 40 days to hatch. There are about 200 species worldwide.

===Pauropoda===
Pauropoda is another small group of small myriapods. They are typically 0.5–2.0 mm long and live in the soil on all continents except Antarctica. Over 700 species have been described. They are believed to be the sister group to millipedes, and have the dorsal tergites fused across pairs of segments, similar to the more complete fusion of segments seen in millipedes.

===Arthropleuridea===
Arthropleurideans were ancient myriapods that are now extinct, known from the late Silurian to the Permian. The most famous members are from the genus &quot;Arthropleura&quot;, which was a giant, probably herbivorous, animal that could be up to long, but the group also includes species less than . Arthropleuridea was historically considered a distinct class of myriapods, but since 2000 scientific consensus has viewed the group as a subset of millipedes, although the relationship of arthropleurideans to other millipedes and to each other is debated.

===Myriapod relationships ===
A variety of groupings (clades) of the myriapod classes have been proposed, some of which are mutually exclusive, and all of which represent hypotheses of evolutionary relationships. Traditional relationships supported by morphological similarities (anatomical or developmental similarities) are challenged by newer relationships supported by molecular evidence (including DNA sequence and amino acid similarities).

*Dignatha (also called Collifera) is a clade consisting of millipedes and pauropods, and is supported by morphological similarities including the presence of a gnathochilarium (a modified jaw and plate apparatus) and a collum, a legless segment behind the head. 
*Trignatha (also called Atelopoda) is a grouping of centipedes and symphylans, united by similarities of mouthparts.
*Edafopoda is a grouping of symphylans and pauropodans that is supported by shared genetic sequences, yet conflicts with Dignatha and Trignatha.
*Pectinopoda consist of millipedes and centipedes, a classification that also supports Edafopoda.
*Progoneata is a group encompassing millipedes, pauropods and symphylans while excluding centipedes. Shared features include reproductive openings (gonopores) behind the second body segment, and sensory hairs (trichobothria) with a bulb-like swelling. It is compatible with either Dignatha or Edafopoda.

<doc id="584097" wikidata="Q1322774" url="?curid=584097" title="Merchant aircraft carrier">
<text>A merchant aircraft carrier (also known as a MAC ship, the Admiralty&#x27;s official &#x27;short name&#x27;) was a limited-purpose aircraft carrier operated under British and Dutch civilian registry during World War II. MAC ships were adapted by adding a flight deck to a bulk grain ship or oil tanker enabling it to operate anti-submarine aircraft in support of Allied convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic.

Despite their quasi-military function, MAC ships retained their mercantile status, continued to carry cargo and operated under civilian command. MAC ships entered service from May 1943 when they began to supplement and supplant escort carriers, and remained operational until the end of the war in Europe.

==Development==
In 1940, Captain M. S. Slattery RN, Director of Air Material at the Admiralty, proposed a scheme for converting merchant ships into aircraft carriers as a follow-up to the CAM ship project. Slattery proposed fitting a flight deck equipped with two arrester wires and a safety barrier onto an existing merchant ship hull. The resulting &#x27;auxiliary fighter carrier&#x27; would be capable of operating six Hurricane fighters while retaining its cargo-carrying ability. The stumbling block for Slattery&#x27;s proposal turned out to be objections from the Ministry of Supply that combining the merchant and aircraft carrier roles would be too complicated. While this would turn out to be over-stated, it seems to have had the effect of diverting attention from the idea of hybrid merchant-warships towards the alternative of converting merchant ships into fully-fledged warships designated &#x27;auxiliary aircraft carriers&#x27;, the first of which, converted from the captured German cargo ship &quot;Hannover&quot;, entered service as &quot;Empire Audacity&quot; (later ) in June 1941.

The hybrid concept re-emerged early in 1942 when, in the face of mounting losses from U-boat attacks, it became apparent that escort carriers building in the US could not be delivered quickly enough in the numbers required. Various people have been credited with re-inventing the idea, including Captain B. B. Schofield RN, Director Trade Division, and John Lamb, Marine Technical Manager of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company. Sir James Lithgow, Controller of Merchant Shipbuilding and Repair and joint-owner of Lithgows Ltd, the Clyde-based shipbuilders, also helped overcome Admiralty reservations about MAC ships. Lithgow is said to have sketched a rough design for one on the back of an envelope and offered to convert two ships about to be built at his family&#x27;s shipyard on condition that &quot;I am not interfered with by the Admiralty&quot;. While the timing of Lithgow&#x27;s possibly apocryphal intervention is uncertain, his deputy, Sir Amos Ayre, the Director of Merchant Shipbuilding, was certainly discussing the requirements for MAC ships by May 1942. Ayre himself credits Sir Douglas Thomson of Ben Line and the Ministry of War Transport with having first suggested the idea.

There was some initial resistance to the MAC ship concept, in particular through concerns about operating aircraft from short, relatively slow ships. The Admiralty considered that a flight deck length of was needed for safe take-offs and landings and a speed of . to provide a sufficient margin over convoy speeds and they were especially doubtful that tankers, with their low freeboards and volatile cargoes, could be utilised.&lt;ref name=&quot;TNA MT59/1966(290642)&quot;&gt;TNA:PRO, MT 59/1966, Minute dated 29 June 1942&lt;/ref&gt; As the U-boat situation worsened, however, such concerns were out-weighed by the urgent need to provide convoy air support, and once it was accepted that the grain ship variant at least could be made to work, the Admiralty became more enthusiastic about the project.

By September 1942, the Admiralty was asking for &quot;about 50&quot; MAC ships to be made available, to allow one to be included in every North Atlantic convoy and in October the requirement was set at 52. This ambitious target had been scaled back to 40 by the time the MAC ship project was formally endorsed by the War Cabinet in October 1942, but it was apparent that even this reduced number could not be produced sufficiently quickly without American help.&lt;ref name=&quot;TNA FO371/32584(271042)&quot;&gt;TNA:PRO, FO 371/32584, Construction of Merchant Aircraft Carriers: Joint Memorandum by First Lord of the Admiralty and Minister of War Transport dated 27 October 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; The US was therefore asked to begin construction of 30 MAC ships to be delivered during the first half of 1943, but a Navy Department committee specially formed to consider the request turned it down because of concerns about the experimental nature of the ships. In the event, all the MAC ships were built and/or converted in British shipyards.

==Conversion programme==

The first two MAC ships were ordered in June 1942 from the Burntisland Shipbuilding Company on the Firth of Forth and William Denny &amp; Brothers of Dumbarton. These ships, which were not strictly conversions but brand-new grain ships that had not yet been laid down, would eventually enter service as and respectively. &quot;Empire MacAlpine&quot; was launched on 23 December 1942 and completed more-or-less on schedule on 21 April 1943. Five more new-build grain ships, , , , and followed at approximately two-month intervals, with &quot;Empire MacDermott&quot; entering service in March 1944.

By late September 1942 it was finally agreed that tanker-MAC ships could be operated safely subject to various limitations about the cargoes they would be allowed to carry. Four new-build tankers were scheduled for conversion but work on these did not start until May 1943. entered service in October 1943, followed at intervals by , and in November 1943. Additional hulls were still needed, however, and it was decided that existing tankers would have to be withdrawn from trade. The most efficient way to approach the task of converting these was to select ships of similar design and, at the beginning of 1943, the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, which had actively promoted the MAC ship concept, offered up its entire fleet of British-registered &#x27;Triple Twelve&#x27; tankers (sometimes referred to as the class) for government charter.

The desirability of converting foreign-owned tankers was also considered and in January 1943 the Ministry of War Transport asked the Norwegian government-in-exile if the modern Norwegian tanker could be converted to a MAC ship under British command. The initial response was not helpful with Norway insisting on financial arrangements that War Transport officials described as &quot;wholly unreasonable as between allies&quot;, but although these were later ameliorated, the proposal eventually foundered because the design effort was judged too much for what would have been a one-off conversion. At about the same time however, a further three tankers of the same class as the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;Triple Twelves&#x27; were identified operating under Dutch registry (Anglo-Saxon Petroleum was a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell). The Netherlands authorities approved the British request but on condition that the ships, as MAC ships, would fly the Dutch flag and be under Dutch civilian command to which the Admiralty, citing potential language difficulties, only reluctantly agreed. In the event, only two of the Dutch ships were taken up as MAC ships but these, and , crewed entirely by Dutch merchant seamen and with aircraft flights drawn from the Royal Netherlands Navy-manned 860 Naval Air Squadron would have the distinction of becoming the Netherlands&#x27; first aircraft carriers.

==Civilian status==

Despite their military appearance and combatant function, MAC ships were civilian ships that did not appear in the &quot;Navy List&quot; nor were they commanded by commissioned officers: this unusual status is one of their defining characteristics. The hybrid nature of the MAC ships raised from the outset the question of whether they would be commissioned warships like the new escort carriers, or if they would operate as merchant ships under the Red Ensign like the earlier CAM ships. The Admiralty&#x27;s preference was to operate them as regular warships but it soon became clear that there were not enough personnel available to man them to naval standards without causing serious shortfalls in other areas, in particular the large numbers of escort carriers that would soon arrive. The Admiralty and Ministry of War Transport therefore agreed that the MAC ships would be civilian-manned. Serious reservations about the proposed civilian status were raised, however, by Foreign Office officials, who were concerned that the ships would be &quot;de facto&quot; warships under international law but, without the protection afforded by the 1907 Hague Convention which applied only to members of the armed forces, their civilian crews would be liable to be treated as unlawful combatants, or &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;. The potential for such action had been clearly demonstrated by the execution in 1916 of Captain Charles Fryatt, for attempting to ram a U-boat with his cross-Channel ferry. The risk to MAC ship crews was considered so great that it was explicitly put before the War Cabinet:

The War Cabinet ordered a review of the situation but the manning difficulties could not be resolved. The Foreign Office reluctantly agreed that the MAC ships would have to operate under the Red Ensign, provided that the merchant seamen and their unions were made aware of the risks involved, and that every possible precaution would be taken to ensure that the men did not fall into enemy hands. In the event, there is little to suggest that the MAC ships&#x27; crews were ever formally notified that they might be at special risk. There is evidence, however, that the authorities remained sensitive about the status of MAC ships which were specifically excluded from the publicity that was arranged for other &#x27;special service&#x27; merchant ships, e.g. rescue ships. As late as September 1944, masters were reminded to point out to their crews the need to maintain secrecy about the MAC ships&#x27; operations and functions.

==Ship details==

The new-build grain carrier MAC ships were based on the Ministry of War Transport&#x27;s standard tramp hull which could just accommodate the Admiralty&#x27;s revised requirement for a flight deck of not less than length and breadth. They were eventually built with flight decks of between . The standard design used for the new-build tankers enabled a longer flight deck of approximately with minor variations between individual ships. An important enhancement was specified for the MAC ships&#x27; machinery. A standard diesel tramp engine developed to give a service speed of . but to provide some margin for flying operations, all the new-build MAC ships were fitted with engines rated at which, in the grain ships, produced a speed of about . The new-build tankers with their higher displacements were still capable of 11 knots. as were the pre-existing &#x27;Triple Twelves&#x27;. The most obvious modification was the flight deck and its supporting structure which was arranged in sections (three on the grain ships; four in the case of tankers) with expansion joints between each. The flight deck was built at the level that would normally have been occupied by the wheelhouse and in the &#x27;Triple Twelves&#x27; this entailed removal of the existing wheelhouse and the funnel. The space immediately under the flight deck was utilised for the arrester gear mechanisms, four wires to each MAC ship with an additional unit fitted to the tankers to operate the trickle wire and safety barrier. A small island structure contained the bridge and wheelhouse and, in the tanker MAC ships, a chartroom that could be used as a pilots&#x27; briefing room. Less apparent modifications included; accommodation for 107 crew (about 50 more than normal); improved internal subdivision; additional ventilation, including exhaust arrangements that could be adjusted to vent to the leeward side; changes to lifeboat positions; and magazines for the safe stowage of bombs, depth charges, ammunition and pyrotechnics. There were minor variations between the types. In the grain MAC ships, the armament sponsons or &#x27;zarebas&#x27; could not project outboard of the moulded line of the hull which necessitated them encroaching onto the flight deck area so that the ship would not be prevented from using commercial berths, but this constraint did not apply to the tankers whose zarebas were extended outboard of the side. One centre cargo tank in each tanker was adapted for the carriage of aircraft fuel (or &#x27;Avgas&#x27;) but in the grain ships this necessitated a special compartment containing two pressurised fuel tanks, together with a control room and associated piping.

The most significant difference between the grain ship and tanker MAC ships was the provision of hangar space within the grain ships. The three after holds were converted to provide a hangar long, wide to a height of in which the ship&#x27;s full complement of four Fairey Swordfish biplane aircraft could be stowed with wings folded. An elevator platform could lift a fully loaded aircraft from hangar to deck level in less than a minute. It was impracticable to fit tanker MAC ships with a hangar as this would have entailed very extensive structural alterations and a significant reduction in cargo capacity. Although capable of operating four aircraft, tanker MAC ships normally embarked three, which all had to be kept on deck: parked aircraft had to be moved to the forward end when other aircraft were landing on, and a collapsible safety barrier was fitted to prevent collisions. Hinged side screens or &#x27;palisades&#x27; were fitted around the aft end of the flight deck to provide weather protection for parked aircraft but with only limited effect.

The net result of the modifications was a reduction in cargo capacity of about 10% in the case of the tankers, but almost 30% for the grain ships, the higher figure on account of the space taken up by the hangar. The modifications themselves were conceptually simple and with standardised designs and extensive use (about 51% by weight of steel) of prefabricated components, the average conversion time was just over five months, but there were significant differences between the average time required to convert new-builds (about 14 weeks) and existing ships (about 27 weeks). There were wide variations within groups; the first &#x27;Triple Twelve&#x27;, &quot;Rapana&quot;, was converted in five months while the final one, &quot;Macoma&quot;, took ten months. Delays arose through a variety of reasons, including labour relations and conflicting priorities in the shipyards, but the supply of arrester gear which was also in high demand for the escort carrier programme was a particular bottleneck that limited the rate at which MAC ships could be completed. 
The &#x27;Triple Twelves&#x27; retained their original names, but the new-builds were given the prefix &quot;Empire&quot; in accordance with the policy for ships owned by the Ministry of War Transport and names that began with &quot;Mac-&quot;, in a reference to their designation as MAC ships. which was originally to have been named &quot;Empire MacKenzie&quot; had the unusual distinction of being renamed while still under construction in tribute to , whose captain, Commander D. W. McKendrick RN, had been killed when she was sunk on convoy escort duty in 1941. Eventually, to avoid confusion with ordinary merchant ships, the Admiralty formally directed that MAC ships should be designated &#x27;MAC Ship&#x27; in all correspondence.

==Cargo arrangements==

Although the most distinctive feature of MACs is their aircraft carrier function, they were conceived at a time when a shortage of shipping capacity threatened to undermine the Allied invasion of North Africa and beyond, and careful planning was needed to maximise their military effectiveness with as little detriment as possible to the carriage of cargo. In their trading role, MACs operated under the aegis of the Ministry of War Transport, with day-to-day management falling to their owners or allotted shipping companies, while control of military aspects fell to the Admiralty, with a new section (the Trade Division DEMS Air Section) specially set up to act as co-ordinating authority.

The MAC ships operated on the North Atlantic route primarily in support of the &#x27;ON&#x27; and &#x27;HX&#x27; series of convoys. An alternative plan to operate tanker MACs with CU convoys between the United Kingdom and Curaçao was rejected because convoys on that route were too fast.&lt;ref name=&quot;TNA ADM1/13087(040343)&quot;&gt;TNA:PRO, ADM 1/13087, Minute by DTD dated 4 March 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; Tankers on the North Atlantic route ordinarily loaded at New York City, but this was undesirable for the MACs because it would have been militarily wasteful to run them between the ON/HX landfall port of Halifax, Nova Scotia and New York, where convoys were already under the umbrella of land-based aircraft. An &#x27;oil pool&#x27; was therefore established at Halifax specifically to enable the tanker MACs to load there, while grain MACs were already able to use the port&#x27;s pre-existing bulk loading facility. The Firth of Clyde was initially designated as the UK terminus for all MAC cargoes because of its superior aviation training facilities. On discovering that it would take more than a week to unload a single ship at the un-modernised facility in Glasgow, it was decided that grain MACs would discharge at Alexandra Dock, Liverpool, where two grain ships could be unloaded simultaneously in thirty-six hours. Tanker MACs normally discharged on the Clyde, with the Mersey as an alternative.

==Aviation arrangements==

There were widely differing opinions about the arrangements needed to support the MAC ships&#x27; aviation function. The Director of Trade Division, who had overall responsibility for co-ordination within the Admiralty, envisaged forming a new headquarters organisation to oversee MAC ship aviation. The Director of Naval Air Organisation disagreed on the basis that MAC ships were an adjunct to the main escort carrier programme, and said that their aircraft should be provided on an ad hoc basis from the squadrons earmarked for escort carriers, having earlier suggested that there might be few, if any, aircraft and crews available for MAC ships. However, when the escort carrier HMS &quot;Dasher&quot; exploded and sank in March 1943 it freed up a squadron&#x27;s-worth of Swordfish aircraft and in June, just after &quot;Empire MacAlpine&quot; entered service, it was announced that No. 836 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) was to relocate from Machrihanish to Belfast in Northern Ireland with nine aircraft as a core for the MAC ships, in addition to providing a common pool for the escort carriers. Before this could be put into place, it was decided that 836 NAS would move instead to Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS) Maydown, in County Londonderry (later named HMS &quot;Shrike&quot;) to become the nucleus squadron for MAC ships and that the MAC ship headquarters unit would be formed there. 840 Naval Air Squadron operated briefly from &quot;Empire MacAndrew&quot; until reorganised as M flight of 836 Squadron in August 1943. Also based at Maydown would be the Royal Netherlands Navy-manned No. 860 Naval Air Squadron, responsible for providing aircraft for the two Dutch MAC ships, &quot;Gadila&quot; and &quot;Macoma&quot;.

===Aircraft===

The only aircraft types to be flown operationally from MAC ships were the Fairey Swordfish Mks. II and III. The flight deck was only wider than the Swordfish wing span, and a Swordfish fully loaded with RP-3 rockets and depth charges might require rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) to launch in unfavourable wind conditions. The normal complement of aircraft was four on grain ships and three on tankers. The tankers were, however, capable of routinely carrying four aircraft and the Dutch MACs &quot;Gadila&quot; and &quot;Macoma&quot; did so on a number of occasions, while the only report of four aircraft on board a British tanker related to an emergency diversion. Lieutenant (later Captain) Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown made a trial landing of a Martlet fighter onto &quot;Amastra&quot; in October 1943 when the use of MACs in the Pacific was being briefly considered.

==MAC ship crews==
MAC ship crews were substantially larger than ordinary merchant ships of similar types. In addition to the air party, they carried extra Merchant Navy radio officers, engineer officers (to maintain and operate the arrester gear), catering staff and, because the total number of crew would exceed 100, a doctor, as required by the Merchant Shipping Act. In practice, it proved difficult to find civilian doctors and medical officers were normally provided by the Royal Navy.

===Air party===
The air party were responsible for flying and supporting the aircraft. The official manning scale comprised a lieutenant commander RN or RNVR who, as Air Staff Officer, was the master&#x27;s principal adviser on naval and aviation matters; a pilot, observer and air gunner for each aircraft carried; three signalmen; five communications and armament ratings; and at least seventeen aircraft fitters. A seventeen-strong DEMS team of RN and Royal Artillery personnel looked after the MAC ships&#x27; substantial defensive armament. To comply with the Board of Trade regulations, all naval and military personnel were signed onto the ship&#x27;s Articles as supernumerary crew members, for which they received a nominal payment of one shilling per month and the more tangible reward of one can of beer per day. They also received a small &#x27;Merchant Navy&#x27; badge, which many apparently wore on their uniforms with cheerful disregard for regulations.

==Operational effectiveness==
By the time the MAC ships entered service the Battle of the Atlantic had already swung permanently in the Allies&#x27; favour through a variety of converging factors. From the beginning of 1944 almost every convoy outbound from the British Isles to North America (ON) and Halifax convoys (HX) that went east-bound to the British Isles contained at least one MAC ship and frequently more. Although MAC ship Swordfish made a dozen attacks, no U-boat was ever destroyed by the four thousand sorties flown from the nineteen MAC ships. Nevertheless, according to the official Naval Staff History:

::&quot;Frequently when there were no kills it was the very presence of aircraft, carrier-borne or shore-based, or both which prevented the development of the attack by a concentration of U-boats on the convoy and which allowed it to continue on its way unmolested.&quot;

It is sometimes claimed that MAC ships enjoyed a near-perfect record in preventing U-boat attacks. In fact, a number of ships were lost to U-boats while sailing in convoys protected by MACs, including six merchantmen and three escorts from the combined convoys ONS 18/ON 202, despite the presence of MAC Ship &quot;Empire MacAlpine&quot;, and two merchantmen and an escort from SC 143 protected by &quot;Rapana&quot;. There can be little doubt, however, that the MAC ships&#x27; contribution to the Battle of the Atlantic was important and highly valued by the seafarers they protected. Merchant ship masters at a pre-convoy conference are said to have cheered when told that a MAC ship would be sailing with the convoy.

Early in 1944 it was agreed that MAC ships could be used to help clear a backlog of more than 500 aircraft awaiting shipment to the United Kingdom and, as the year progressed, a number of MAC ships made non-operational ferry crossings with full deck cargoes of aircraft. In September 1944, some MAC ships were fitted with equipment to refuel escorts by means of a hose streamed over the stern. By this time it was becoming apparent that all nineteen MAC ships were no longer required to protect Atlantic convoys. The possibility of using them in the Pacific as aircraft carriers or fleet oilers had been considered earlier but rejected on the grounds of cost-effectiveness and in September/October 1944, &quot;Acavus&quot;, &quot;Amastra&quot;, &quot;Ancylus&quot; and &quot;Rapana&quot; were taken out of service for reinstatement as conventional merchant ships at an estimated cost to the Government of £40,000 each. The remaining MAC ships were released for reinstatement at the end of May 1945.

<text>The G6, sometimes denoted as the G6 &quot;Rhino&quot;, is a South African self-propelled howitzer. It was developed as a turreted, self-propelled variant of the G5 howitzer series, mating the gun to a six-wheeled mine-protected armoured chassis. Design work on the G6 began in the late 1970s to replace the obsolescent Sexton being retired from service with the artillery regiments of the South African Army. Serial production commenced between 1988 and 1999.

At the time of its introduction, the G6 was considered one of the most mobile self-propelled howitzers in service. Its chassis was engineered to be mine-resistant and blastproof, allowing it to survive multiple TM-46 detonations during trials. The G6 was conceived as a wheeled rather than a tracked vehicle for this purpose, as well as to allow it to deploy long distances by road without consuming excessive quantities of fuel or requiring a tank transporter.

G6s entered service during the last two years of the South African Border War, frequently shelling positions held by the People&#x27;s Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) during the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale. Their ability to bombard a target and change positions rapidly in less than two minutes, with minimal preparation, greatly reduced the threat posed by retaliatory Angolan air raids and counter-battery fire. A number of G6s were subsequently manufactured for export and purchased by Abu Dhabi and Oman. Export models included a specialist anti-aircraft variant with a GEC-Marconi Marksman turret and twin-barrelled 35mm autocannon.

Chile briefly produced the G6 under licence as the &quot; CC-SP-45&quot;, although this arrangement was later terminated after the system was not adopted by that country&#x27;s armed forces. Iraq also manufactured its own domestic variant of the G6 as the &quot;Al Majnoon&quot; with technical assistance from Canadian artillery engineer Gerald Bull, which later evolved into the much larger and more sophisticated Al Fao.

==Combat history==
The first G6 prototype appeared in 1981, during the height of the South African Border War. Four engineering development models were being tested with the South African Defence Force by the mid-1980s. In October 1987, the South African government ordered all the G6s deployed to Angola for combat trials as part of Operation Hooper. One suffered an engine failure, so only three actually reached Angola, where they joined expeditionary troops of the 4 South African Infantry Battalion. Operating as an independent battery, the three G6s were instrumental in the bombardment of the strategic Angolan airfield at Cuito Cuanavale. In this their crews were significantly aided by South African special forces acting as forward artillery observers near the airfield; on one occasion the G6s were able to destroy four Angolan Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s on the ground as they attempted to take off.

The heightened artillery threat to the Cuito Cuanavale airfield eventually forced the Angolan pilots to relocate their operations to another airstrip at Menongue, which was beyond the range of the G5 and G6 but severely diminished their ability to time and execute their missions, given Menongue&#x27;s distance from the actual fighting. However, they also began making South African artillery positions the primary targets of their raids, forcing the G6 crews to constantly shift positions after each bombardment. The G6s themselves were considered so valuable that an air defence contingent from South Africa&#x27;s 10 Anti-Aircraft Regiment was subsequently attached to the battery for the remainder of the campaign.

The G6 is not known to have seen combat again until 2015, when a single battery was deployed with the United Arab Emirates Defence Force to Aden during the Yemeni Crisis. The howitzers were landed in Aden by ship and escorted by a large Emirati armoured formation. They have since been used to shell Houthi militant positions in support of Emirati and allied Yemeni offensives carried out near Taiz.

The &quot;Res Gestae&quot; is especially significant because it gives an insight into the image Augustus presented to the Roman people. Various portions of the &quot;Res Gestae&quot; have been found in modern Turkey. The inscription itself is a monument to the establishment of the Julio-Claudian dynasty that was to follow Augustus.

==Structure==
The text consists of a short introduction, 35 body paragraphs and a posthumous addendum. The paragraphs are conventionally grouped into four sections: political career, public benefactions, military accomplishments and a political statement.

The first section (paragraphs 2–14) is concerned with Augustus&#x27; political career; it records the offices and political honours that he held. Augustus also lists numerous offices he refused to take and privileges he refused to be awarded. The second section (paragraphs 15–24) lists Augustus&#x27; donations of money, land and grain to the citizens of Italy and his soldiers, as well as the public works and gladiatorial spectacles that he commissioned. The text is careful to point out that all this was paid for out of Augustus&#x27; own funds. The third section (paragraphs 25–33) describes his military deeds and how he established alliances with other nations during his reign. Finally the fourth section (paragraphs 34–35) consists of a statement of the Romans&#x27; approval for the reign and deeds of Augustus. The appendix is written in the third person and likely not by Augustus himself. It summarizes the entire text, lists various buildings that he renovated or constructed and states that Augustus spent 600 million silver denarii (24 million gold aurei) from his own funds during his reign on public projects. Ancient currencies cannot be reliably converted into modern equivalents, but it is clearly more than anyone else in the empire could afford. Augustus consolidated his hold on power by reversing the prior tax policy beginning with funding the &quot;aerarium militare&quot; with 170 million sesterces of his own money.

==History==
The text was completed just one month before Augustus&#x27; death (19 August AD 14), although most of its content was written years earlier and likely went through many revisions. Augustus left the text with his will, which instructed the Senate to set up the inscriptions. The original, which has not survived, was engraved upon a pair of bronze pillars and placed in front of Augustus&#x27; mausoleum. Many copies of the text were made and carved in stone on monuments or temples throughout the Roman Empire, some of which have survived; most notably, almost a full copy, written in the original Latin and a Greek translation was preserved on a temple to Augustus in Ancyra (the &quot;Monumentum Ancyranum&quot; of Ankara, Turkey); others have been found at Apollonia and Antioch, both in Pisidia.

==Content==
The text is not a full account of the years between 44 BC, the assassination of Augustus&#x27; adoptive father Julius Caesar, and AD 14, the year in which he died. Instead, it is a personal account of the first Emperor&#x27;s life and those achievements that he decided to be worth remembering by the Roman people. It is an independent self-depiction that is written in a literary form which is unique to the ancient world, and it must be read as such. This period of history is seen from Augustus&#x27; perspective and the author presents facts that relate only to himself. Augustus&#x27; enemies are never mentioned by name. Caesar&#x27;s murderers Brutus and Cassius are called simply &quot;those who killed my father&quot;. Mark Antony and Sextus Pompey, Augustus&#x27; opponents in the East, remain equally anonymous; the former is &quot;he with whom I fought the war,&quot; while the latter is merely a &quot;pirate&quot;. One writer, Werner Eck, says that it cannot be stated that Augustus made any false statements. Any comprehensive understanding of this period of Roman history should be supplemented by statements from other ancient sources, archaeology, and inscriptions.

The introduction and first two pararagraphs of the inscription found at the &quot;Monumentum Ancyranum&quot; of Ankara read as such:

<text>Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte () is a commune in the Manche department in Normandy in north-western France. It is situated in the Cotentin Peninsula near Valognes. Its population was 2,099 in 2018.

==History==
The Château de Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, an ancient castle with massive 14th century towers, and a 12-15th century abbey still mark a vivid history during the Middle Ages.

The city walls were breached by cannon during a siege in 1374. This is believed to have been among the first successful uses of guns against city walls in history.
==Population==
==Heraldry==
==Notable people==
The English knight Sir John Chandos (died 1369) held the title Viscount of Saint-Sauveur-le Vicomte in the Cotentin.

Sir Alan Buxhull KG succeeded Sir John Chandos as Captain of the Castle during the 100 Years War.

The Blessed Catherine of St. Augustine, O.S.A., was born here in 1632. She was sent by her Order as a missionary nurse to New France, serving at the Hôtel-Dieu de Québec, where she died in 1668. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1989.

The novelist Jules Amédée Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly was born there on 2 November 1808. A museum is now dedicated to him.

Sister Marie-Madeleine Postel acquired the derelict Benedictine monastery at St-Sauveur-le-Vicomte in 1830 which became the headquarters of the Sisters of the Christian Schools of Mercy; in 1846 she died in the town.

Medieval knight Geoffroy d&#x27;Harcourt who fought for both the French, and the English, during the 100 years war.

<doc id="584118" wikidata="Q2901966" url="?curid=584118" title="Rivalry (economics)">
<text>In economics, a good is said to be rivalrous or a rival if its consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers, or if consumption by one party reduces the ability of another party to consume it. A good is considered non-rivalrous or non-rival if, for any level of production, the cost of providing it to a marginal (additional) individual is zero. A good is &quot;anti-rivalrous&quot; and &quot;inclusive&quot; if each person benefits more when other people consume it. 

A good can be placed along a continuum from rivalrous through non-rivalrous to anti-rivalrous. The distinction between rivalrous and non-rivalrous is sometimes referred to as jointness of supply or subtractable or non-subtractable. Economist Paul Samuelson made the distinction between private and public goods in 1954 by introducing the concept of nonrival consumption. Economist Richard Musgrave followed on and added rivalry and excludability as criteria for defining consumption goods in 1959 and 1969.  

== Rivalry == 

Most tangible goods, both durable and nondurable, are rival goods. A hammer is a durable rival good. One person&#x27;s use of the hammer prevents others from using the hammer at the same time. However, the first user does not &quot;use up&quot; the hammer, meaning that some rival goods can still be shared through time. An apple is a nondurable rival good: once an apple is eaten, it is &quot;used up&quot; and can no longer be eaten by others. Non-tangible goods can also be rivalrous. Examples include the ownership of radio spectra and domain names. In more general terms, almost all private goods are rivalrous.

== Non-rivalry == 

In contrast, non-rival goods may be consumed by one consumer without preventing simultaneous consumption by others. Most examples of non-rival goods are intangible. Broadcast television is an example of a non-rival good; when a consumer turns on a TV set, this does not prevent the TV in another consumer&#x27;s house from working. The television itself is a rival good, but television broadcasts are non-rival goods. Other examples of non-rival goods include a beautiful scenic view, national defense, clean air, street lights, and public safety. More generally, most intellectual property is non-rival. In fact, certain types of intellectual property become &quot;more&quot; valuable as more people consume them (anti-rival). For example, the more people use a particular language, the more valuable that language becomes.

Non-rivalry does not imply that the total production costs are low, but that the &quot;marginal&quot; production costs are zero. In reality, few goods are completely non-rival as rivalry can emerge at certain levels. For instance, use of public roads, the Internet, or police/law courts is non-rival up to a certain capacity, after which congestion means that each additional user decreases speed for others. For that, recent economic theory views rivalry as a continuum, not as a binary category, where many goods are somewhere between the two extremes of completely rival and completely non-rival. A perfectly non-rival good can be consumed simultaneously by an unlimited number of consumers.

== Anti-rivalry ==

Goods are anti-rivalrous and inclusive if the consumer’s enjoyment increases with how many others consume the good. The concept was introduced by Steven Weber (2004), saying that when more people use free and open-source software, it becomes easier and more powerful for all users. Lessig noted that any natural language is anti-rivalrous, because its utility increases with how much it is used by others. Cooper noted that efforts to combat climate change are perversely anti-rivalrous — any country acting as a free rider will benefit from the efforts of others to combat this problem, even while not contributing itself.

<text>The Little Belt Bridge (), also known as the Old Little Belt Bridge (), is a truss bridge over the Little Belt strait in Denmark. It spans from Snoghøj on the Jutland side to Middelfart on Funen.

The bridge is owned by the state and Banedanmark, the Danish railway authority, is responsible for its maintenance. It was the first bridge constructed over the strait, beginning the connection of the three main parts of Denmark by road and rail, which was completed with the Great Belt Bridge in June 1998. Previously, only ferries and other boats had transported people over the belts.

== Construction ==

The Little Belt Bridge was built by Monberg &amp; Thorsen. Construction of the bridge began in 1929 and it was opened for traffic on 14 May 1935. It is 1,178 metres long, 20.5 metres wide and 33 metres high, with a main span of 220 metres. On the bridge there are two railway tracks, two narrow lanes for cars to cross as well as a sidewalk for pedestrians. No mass machinery was used in the construction of the bridge at the time. The bases of the piles were lowered into the sea from boats according to precise calculations, and molds both for the piles and each end of the bridge were first constructed of wood and later manually filled with cement from buckets.

== Conversion to railway use==
When the new Little Belt Bridge came into use in 1970, the old bridge lost its function as the main traffic line for cars between Funen and Jutland; however, it is still used as the only railway bridge between Jutland and Funen and thus the only railway line connecting Jutland with Zealand as well, as well as to carry traffic between Fredericia and Middelfart and their neighbouring villages.

== Maintenance ==

The bridge requires constant maintenance. During the first decades after its construction, a group of workers would begin painting the entire steel structure from one end, proceed to the other and begin all over again once that was finished. 
Five to thirteen people work on the bridge at all times.

The bridge was closed to road traffic for most of 2018 and 2019 due to renovation work. Rail traffic continued almost uninterupted, as the bridge is the only connection over Little Belt for trains.

== Tours ==
In 2015, guided &#x27;bridgewalking&#x27; tours on top of the framework were introduced at the Little Belt Bridge. A standard tour will take two hours and is offered among high security measures.

<text>McClure&#x27;s or McClure&#x27;s Magazine (1893–1929) was an American illustrated monthly periodical popular at the turn of the 20th century. The magazine is credited with having started the tradition of muckraking journalism (investigative, watchdog, or reform journalism), and helped direct the moral compass of the day.

The publishing company briefly got into the film business with McClure Pictures.

==History==
Founded by S. S. McClure (1857–1949) and John Sanborn Phillips (1861–1949), who had been classmates at Knox College, in June 1893. Phillips put up the $7,300 needed to launch the magazine. The magazine featured both political and literary content, publishing serialized novels-in-progress, a chapter at a time. In this way, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; published writers including Willa Cather, Arthur Conan Doyle, Herminie T. Kavanagh, Rudyard Kipling, Jack London, Lincoln Steffens, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Mark Twain.

At the beginning of the 20th century, its major competitors included &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

Examples of its work include Ida Tarbell&#x27;s series in 1902 exposing the monopoly abuses of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Company, and Ray Stannard Baker&#x27;s earlier look at the United States Steel Corporation, which focused the public eye on the conduct of corporations. From January 1907 to June 1908, &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; published the first detailed history of Christian Science and the story of its founder, Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910) in 14 installments. The articles were later published in book form as &quot;The Life of Mary Baker G. Eddy and the History of Christian Science&quot; (1909).

In 1906 three staffers left to form &quot;The American Magazine&quot;. Shortly thereafter &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; found itself in financial trouble, in part because a publishing plant the company was building for a cost of $105,000 ended up costing over three times that amount. Advertising revenue had also fallen. By 1911 S.S. McClure had lost control of the company, forced to sell the magazine to creditors. It was re-styled as a women&#x27;s magazine and ran inconsistently in this format, with publication paused from October 1921 to February 1922, September 1924 to April 1925, and February 1926 to May 1926. The later issues, from July 1928 until March 1929, were published under the name &quot;New McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. The last issue was in March 1929, after which the magazine was taken over by &quot;The Smart Set&quot;. In 1916 the magazine published an &quot;Automobile Year Book&quot; (&quot;First McClure Automobile Year Book&quot;) with the specifications and pictures of over 100 different major producers of passenger and commercial vehicles.

<text>Richard Ben-Veniste (born January 3, 1943) is an American lawyer. He first rose to prominence as a special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal. He has also been a member of the 9/11 Commission. He is known for his pointed questions and criticisms of members of both the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. In 2017, he became a CNN Legal Analyst.

==Early life and education==
Ben-Veniste was born to a Jewish family, his father of Levantine origin and his mother of Russian and German origin. He graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City in 1960, earned an A.B. from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 1964, an LL.B. from Columbia Law School in New York City (1967), and an LL.M. from Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago in 1968.

==Career==
Ben-Veniste was an assistant U.S. attorney (1968–1973) in the Southern District of New York, and chief of the Special Prosecutions section, (1971–1973). He became a leading Watergate prosecutor, as chief of the Watergate Task Force of the Watergate Special Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, (1973–1975).

He was the Democrats&#x27; chief counsel (1995–1996) on the Senate Whitewater Committee which investigated a variety of allegations involving Bill and Hillary Clinton. He argued that the Clintons did no wrong in connection with their investment in a failed land development project named Whitewater, or in their other Arkansas business affairs, nor did they commit violations of law after Mr. Clinton became president.

Ben-Veniste was a presidential appointee (2000) to the Nazi War Crimes and Japanese Imperial Government Records Interagency Working Group, which ultimately declassified some 8 million documents relating to war crimes in the World War II and post-war era.

==9/11 Commission==
Ben-Veniste was a member (2002) of the 9/11 Commission, where he developed a reputation for asking tough questions and demanding access to sensitive documents, although in some circles he was accused of grandstanding. His interrogation of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was contentious, and led to the declassification of the previously secret August 6, 2001, President&#x27;s Daily Brief: &quot;Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.&quot; The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; was published in 2004 and has been read by millions of readers worldwide.

Ben-Veniste was a partner of the Washington, D.C., law firm of Melrod, Redman &amp; Gartlan (1975–1981). In 1981 he formed Ben-Veniste and Shennoff, where he practiced for 10 years. He joined Weil, Gotshal and Manges in 1991, where he was a partner until 2002. Ben-Veniste was a partner at Mayer Brown LLP from 2002 until January 2023.

<text>Arnolt Schlick (July 18?, c. 1455–1460 – after 1521) was a German organist, lutenist and composer of the Renaissance. He is grouped among the composers known as the Colorists. He was most probably born in Heidelberg and by 1482 established himself as court organist for the Electorate of the Palatinate. Highly regarded by his superiors and colleagues alike, Schlick played at important historical events, such as the election of Maximilian I as King of the Romans, and was widely sought after as organ consultant throughout his career. The last known references to him are from 1521; the circumstances of his death are unknown.

Schlick was blind for much of his life, possibly from birth. However, that did not stop him from publishing his work. He is best known for &quot;Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten&quot; (1511), the first German treatise on building and playing organs. This work, highly influential during the 16th century, was republished in 1869 and is regarded today as one of the most important books of its kind. Schlick&#x27;s surviving compositions include &quot;Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang&quot; (1512), a collection of organ and lute music, and a few pieces in manuscript. The lute pieces—mostly settings of popular songs—are among the earliest published; but Schlick&#x27;s organ music is even more historically important. It features sophisticated cantus firmus techniques, multiple truly independent lines (up to five—and, in one case, ten—voices), and extensive use of imitation. Thus, it predates the advances of Baroque music by about a hundred years, making Schlick one of the most important composers in the history of keyboard music.

==Life==

===Early life===
Records of Schlick&#x27;s early life are sparse: he lived and worked at Heidelberg, which was almost completely destroyed during the War of the Grand Alliance, so almost no records survive from the time Schlick was born. Nevertheless, linguistic analysis of his writings has shown that Schlick was most likely from the area around Heidelberg, and recent research showed that Schlick was most probably born into a family of a Heidelberg butcher, whose family name may have been Slicksupp. If Schlick&#x27;s parents followed the contemporary German custom to name children after the saint on whose day they were born, Schlick must have been born on July 18, St. Arnold&#x27;s day. As for the year of birth, since Schlick married in 1482 and described himself as &quot;an old man&quot; by 1520, he was probably born between 1455 and 1460. Schlick was blind for much of his life, and may have been born blind.

No documents survive concerning Schlick&#x27;s apprenticeship. Johannes von Soest and an otherwise unknown &quot;Petrus Organista de Oppenheim&quot; could be his teachers, as could Conrad Paumann, if only for a brief time when he (possibly) visited Heidelberg in 1472. The earliest mention of Schlick&#x27;s place of employment is in his marriage contract: in 1482 he married Barbara Struplerin, a servant of Elector Philip&#x27;s sons, and the contract lists him as a court organist. Schlick and his family lived in a house on the Burgweg, a path that led to the Heidelberg Castle (although by 1482 Schlick had already inherited his father&#x27;s house in Heidelberg).

===Career===
Schlick was apparently held in very great regard by his superiors. By 1509 he was the highest-paid musician at the court with a salary almost twice as high as that of the next-best-paid musician, and comparable to the salary of the court treasurer. Evidently, this position was already established by 1486, when Schlick performed at the election of Archduke Maximilian as King of the Romans at Frankfurt, on February 16 of that year (Schlick may also have performed at Maximilian&#x27;s coronation six weeks later). It was at this election that Schlick must have first met Paul Hofhaimer. In either 1489 or 1490 (the precise year is uncertain), Schlick travelled to the Netherlands: he alludes to the journey in his preface to &quot;Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang&quot;, but his reasons remain obscure. Recent scholarship unearthed evidence of payments to other Electorate of the Palatinate musicians, made by Utrecht authorities, and although no mention of the court travelling to Utrecht in 1489–1490 has been found, it is entirely possible that such a journey did happen. An older version of Schlick&#x27;s motives was that he went to the Low Countries to escape from the plague which was then ravaging the Heidelberg area.

In October 1503 King Philip I of Castile visited Heidelberg, bringing with him a large enoutrage that included the composers Pierre de la Rue and Alexander Agricola, and organist Henry Bredemers. Schlick almost certainly met these musicians, and probably played the organ at the performance of the Mass that took place during Philip&#x27;s visit. The next known contemporary report that mentions Schlick is from February 23, 1511, when he played at the wedding of Louis V, Elector Palatine and Sibylle of Bavaria. Nothing certain is known about Schlick&#x27;s other performances. We know that he was present at one of the diets at Worms, either in 1509 or at the famous diet of 1495. The presence of an unnamed Heidelberg court lutenist in Basel in 1509 is documented, and as Schlick was an accomplished lutenist, it might have been him. In 1516, Schlick visited Torgau for unknown reasons; he may have played the organ there, and presumably met Hofaimer again, since the latter was Torgau&#x27;s court organist at the time.

The year 1511 saw the publication of Schlick&#x27;s organ treatise, &quot;Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Organ Builders and Organists&quot;). The book was published in Speyer; it is the first known German treatise on organ building and performance, and was very influential in Germany. Also in 1511, Schlick&#x27;s son Arnolt the Younger pleaded to his father to publish at least some of his music; the father complied and published &quot;Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang und lidlein uff die orgeln un lauten&quot; (&quot;Tablatures of [Several] Canticles and Songs for Organ and Lute&quot;) the next year, a collection of organ and lute music. A few of the biographical details are found in the preface to the latter work (which consists of Arnolt the Younger&#x27;s letter to his father) and Schlick&#x27;s reply. Schlick writes, for instance, about his journey to the Low Countries, and about the row he had with Sebastian Virdung in either 1495 or 1509. Schlick apparently met Virdung in Worms in 1495 or 1509 and helped him in some way. Some years later, in his treatise &quot;Musica getutscht&quot; (1511) Virdung ridiculed Schlick&#x27;s adherence to the view that the black keys should be considered musica ficta, and made rude remarks about the composer&#x27;s blindness. In the preface to &quot;Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang&quot; Schlick retorts with mentions of Virdung&#x27;s numerous mistakes in the musical examples from &quot;Musica getutscht&quot;, and condemns Virdung&#x27;s ingratitude. Schlick also mentions his plans to publish another book of music, but no trace of such a publication is known.

Throughout his life, Schlick was in high demand as an organ consultant. The earliest record of his activity in this field is from 1491, when he inspected the instrument of the Strasbourg Cathedral. Twelve more reports survive about such trips: among others, Schlick passed judgements on organs at St. George&#x27;s Church, Haguenau, Speyer Cathedral, and the Stiftskirche, Neustadt an der Weinstraße. The last reference to Schlick is from 1521, when he examined an organ at St. George, Haguenau. This job was apparently carried out during December 1520–January 1521, and a letter survives from about the same time, from Schlick to Bernardo Clesio, Bishop of Trent; Schlick sent Clesio two sets of chorale settings. After this, Schlick disappears from history. In 1524 another organist was employed in his place.

==Writings==

Schlick&#x27;s treatise on organ building and organ playing, &quot;Spiegel der Orgelmacher und Organisten&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Organ Builders and Organists&quot;), was published in 1511 in Speyer by Peter Drach. Only two copies survive to this day, but the book has long been recognized as one of the most important of its kind. The &quot;Spiegel&quot; is the earliest German organ treatise, and also the first book on musical matters to enjoy an imperial privilege (issued by Emperor Maximilian to protect Schlick&#x27;s rights). It was widely influential in Maximilian&#x27;s empire, but became obsolete towards the 17th century because of the advances in organ building. After years of oblivion, the &quot;Spiegel&quot; was republished in 1869, and interest in it has been growing ever since: a summary of its contents in modern language was available in 1870, a complete translation into modern German appeared in 1931, a partial English translation first became available in &quot;Organ Institute Quarterly&quot;, published between 1957 and 1960, and a complete English translation followed in 1980. Facsimile editions of the treatise appeared as early as 1959.

Schlick&#x27;s book begins with a preface in three parts: the composer first thanks his patrons, then briefly discusses the nature of music, and finally describes the purpose of the &quot;Spiegel&quot;: it was not intended for organists and/or organ builders, as it may seem from the title, but for those church and monastery authorities who wanted to buy an organ, or had one entrusted to their care. Schlick&#x27;s remarks about the nature of music are similar to those in other musical treatises of the time: he quotes, like numerous other authors of the period, the Bible, Aristotle, Boethius, Asclepiades of Bithynia and Guido of Arezzo. Quotations from these sources support Schlick&#x27;s own views: that music has a profound effect on the listeners, and can heal both the body and the spirit. Schlick also praises the organ as the best musical instrument, his argument being that extensive polyphony with as many as six or seven parts can be executed by a single person on the organ.

The preface is followed by ten chapters which cover practically every aspect of organ-building: tuning, keyboard construction, making of chests, bellows, stops, etc.; even the instrument&#x27;s position in the church and its decorations are discussed (Schlick&#x27;s point of view being that excessive decorations are undesirable). Among other things, Schlick describes his &quot;ideal&quot; organ, which is a two-manual instrument with eight to ten stops for the Hauptwerk, four for the Rückpositiv, and four in the pedal:

He emphasizes that each stop should have a distinct sound, easily distinguishable from all others, and that performers should make good use of contrasting registrations. Some of the stops Schlick mentions are difficult to identify precisely, due to the age of the treatise and the changes that took place in organ-building since the 16th century. Perhaps the most mysterious is the &quot;hůltze gletcher&quot;, a stop with a percussive sound which Schlick admired and compared to &quot;a bowl that idle journeymen hit with spoons.&quot; However, Schlick&#x27;s descriptions of other stops also require interpretation; for example, he describes the Rückpositiv Zimbel with the words &quot;guts reins Zymmelein&quot;, &quot;good clean Zimbel&quot; from which later authors infer the lack of Tierce ranks. Schlick&#x27;s explanations of his &quot;ideal&quot; organ also reveal much about contemporary musical attitudes. For example, he recommends a compass of F-a&quot; in order to give &quot;a good independent bass line&quot;, and he states that the pedal should not consist solely of low sub-octave stops, as this would &quot;invert the harmony&quot;, presumably a reference to the increased role of the pedal in playing a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; melody that was considered to be a tenor line, now freed from its medieval subservience.

The most discussed part of the &quot;Spiegel&quot; is its second chapter, which concerns organ pitch. To illustrate how an organ should be tuned, Schlick indicates the length of a pipe speaking F, the bottom note of his compass. To this end, a line is printed in the margin, and the length of the pipe is given as being 16 times the length of that line. Numerous estimates have been suggested in the past, and some scholars (most notably Arthur Mendel) actually doubted whether the length of the line in question was rendered correctly during printing. Today, most scholars agree that the pipe would produce a sound slightly more than a whole tone below the present-day F. The temperament Schlick advocates is an irregular one, close to meantone; the major thirds are slightly wider than pure. Schlick rejected keyboards with split accidentals.

==Music==

===Organ music===
Schlick&#x27;s organ music survives in two sources: the printed collection &quot;Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang&quot; (1512) and the letter Schlick sent to Bernardo Clesio around 1520–1521. &quot;Tabulaturen&quot; contains ten compositions for organ: a setting of &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (five verses), &quot;Pete quid vis&quot;, &quot;Hoe losteleck&quot;, &quot;Benedictus&quot;, &quot;Primi toni&quot;, &quot;Maria zart&quot;, &quot;Christe&quot;, and three settings of &quot;Da pacem&quot;. Of these, only &quot;Salve Regina&quot; and the &quot;Da pacem&quot; settings are fully authentic. Much of the other music is stylistically indistinguishable from contemporary vocal works by other composers; consequently, some of the pieces may be intabulations of other composers&#x27; works. However, as of 2009, no models are known for any of the pieces, and so Schlick&#x27;s authorship remains undisputed.

The &quot;Salve Regina&quot; setting is among the most important of Schlick&#x27;s works. Unlike most preceding and contemporary organ composers, Schlick tends to use four voices rather than three, and in the first verse there are instances of two voices in the pedal, a technique unheard of at the time. Schlick&#x27;s setting also sets itself apart by relying heavily on imitation, sequence and fragmentation of motives, techniques seldom employed so consistently in organ music of the day. The first movement begins with an imitative exposition of an original theme with an unusually wide (for a theme used imitatively) range of a twelfth and proceeds to free counterpoint with instances of fragments of the original theme. Movements 2 and 3 (&quot;Ad te clamamus&quot; and &quot;Eya ergo&quot;) begin by treating the cantus firmus imitatively, and the opening of &quot;Eya ergo&quot; constitutes one of the earliest examples of fore-imitation:

This technique, in which a motif treated imitatively &quot;foreshadows&quot; the entrance of the cantus firmus, later played a major part in the development of the organ chorale. Schlick&#x27;s methods of creating complementary motives also look towards a much later stage of evolution, namely the techniques employed by Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck. Early music scholar Willi Apel, who authored the earliest comprehensive analysis of Schlick&#x27;s keyboard music, writes:
Schlick&#x27;s &quot;Salve&quot; is one of the truly great masterpieces of organ art, perhaps the first one to deserve to be so ranked. It still breathes the strict spirit of the Middle Ages, which brought forth so many wonderful works, but new forces are already at work that lend this composition a novel fulness of expression and sound.
Schlick&#x27;s three &quot;Da pacem&quot; settings also look to the future, because, although Schlick does not refer to them as a cycle anywhere in the &quot;Tabulaturen&quot;, the placement of the cantus firmus suggests that the three settings are part of a large plan. The antiphon is in the discantus in the first setting, in the tenor in the second, and in the bass in the third. Similar plans are observed in Sweelinck&#x27;s and later composers&#x27; chorale variations. Technically, Schlick&#x27;s settings exhibit a contrapuntal technique similar to that of &quot;Salve Regina&quot;.

Schlick&#x27;s &quot;Benedictus&quot; and &quot;Christe&quot; are three-voice settings of mass movements. The former has been called &quot;the first organ ricercar&quot; because of its use of imitation in a truly fugal manner, but it remains unclear whether the composition is an original piece by Schlick or an intabulation of a vocal work by another composer. The piece is in three sections, the first of which begins with a fugal exposition, and the second is a canon between the outer voices. Schlick&#x27;s &quot;Christe&quot; is more loosely constructed: although imitation is used throughout, there are no fugal expositions or canonic techniques employed. The piece begins with a long two-voice section. Other organ pieces in the &quot;Tabulaturen&quot; employ a variety of methods, most relying on imitation (with the notable exception of &quot;Primi toni&quot;, which is also unusual for its title, which merely indicates the tone, but not the cantus firmus). For example, Schlick&#x27;s setting of &quot;Maria zart&quot; (a German song famously used by Jacob Obrecht for &quot;Missa Maria zart&quot;, one of the longest polyphonic settings of the Mass Ordinary ever written) splits the melody into thirteen fragments, treated imitatively one by one. A similar procedure, only with longer fragments of the melody used, is employed in &quot;Hoe losteleck&quot;, a piece based on a song which may have had secular character. &quot;Pete quid vis&quot;, a piece of unknown origins and function, consists of a large variety of different treatments of a single theme, either treated imitatively itself, or accompanied by independently conceived imitative passages.

Schlick&#x27;s letter to Bernardo Clesio contains his only known late works: a set of eight settings of the sequence verse &quot;Gaude Dei genitrix&quot; (from the Christmas sequence &quot;Natus ante saecula&quot;) and a set of two settings of the Ascension antiphon &quot;Ascendo ad Patrem meum&quot;. Both sets have didactic purposes. &quot;Gaude Dei genitrix&quot; settings establish various ways of reinforcing a two-voice setting, in which the chant is accompanied by moderately ornamented counterpoint, by duplicating both lines in parallel thirds, fourths, or sixths. The pieces, which may have been intended for voices rather than the organ, range from three- to five-voice settings. Schlick himself noted the didactic aspect, writing that he &quot;found and made a separate rule for each setting, which are so clear that it will be easy to set all chants in the same manner.&quot; His &quot;Ascendo ad Patrem meum&quot; settings serve a different purpose, but also are a miniature encyclopaedia: the first setting is in two voices (and so the most basic of all possible settings), whereas the second is in ten voices (and so the most advanced of all possible settings). The ten-voice work is unique in organ repertoire, both for the polyphonic scope and the pedal technique.

===Lute settings===
The &quot;Tabulaturen etlicher lobgesang&quot; is the earliest extensive source of German lute music and also one of the earliest published collections of lute music known. There are fifteen lute pieces, twelve of which are duets for voice and lute. The pieces are organized by difficulty, which reflects the didactic aspect of the &quot;Tabulaturen&quot;. Curiously, Schlick does not include performing instructions, which are commonplace in most later German publications, and furthermore, no texts are included, although most can be found in contemporary sources—there are just three songs unique to the &quot;Tabulaturen&quot; (&quot;Mein lieb ist weg&quot;, &quot;Philips zwolffpot&quot; and &quot;All Ding mit radt&quot;). Almost all the songs are settings of German polyphonic Lieder on secular texts. There are two exceptions. The first, &quot;Metzkin Isaack&quot;, may be of Netherlandish origin, and there is a possibility that Schlick learned the piece from Petrucci&#x27;s &quot;Harmonice Musices Odhecaton&quot;. This would imply that Schlick borrowed the idea to apply for an imperial privilege for &quot;Spiegel&quot; and &quot;Tabulaturen&quot; from Petrucci. The second exception is &quot;All Ding mit radt&quot;, which is different from every other piece in the &quot;Tabulaturen&quot;: it relies not on the phrase structure of the song, like other settings, but rather on motivic and harmonic principles. Also, unlike other lute settings, it does not use bar form.

In most settings Schlick uses mixed notation: the upper part is notated mensurally, while the lower parts are given in tablature. The practice was rarely used in Germany at the time, but it appears in many contemporary French and Italian sources, such as collections of frottolas by Franciscus Bossinensis (1509–1511) or Marchetto Cara (c. 1520), and Pierre Attaingnant&#x27;s publications (late 1520s). Another important deviation from the German norm is Schlick&#x27;s tendency to put the cantus firmus in the highest part, the discantus, whereas the norm for German Lieder was cantus firmus in the tenor.

As is usual for lute intabulations, none of Schlick&#x27;s settings are completely faithful to their models. The changes range from addition of modest ornaments, as in &quot;Nach lust&quot; or &quot;Vil hinderlist&quot;, to insertions of new material, as in &quot;Mein M. ich hab&quot; and &quot;Weg wart dein art&quot;. One particularly important change occurs in Schlick&#x27;s intabulation of &quot;Hertzliebstels pild&quot;, in which Schlick attempts a type of word painting: the words &quot;mit reichem Schall&quot; (&quot;with rich sound/splendor&quot;) are illustrated by an increase in rhythmic activity. The three solo lute settings are all in three voices, and present three distinct ways of three-voice intabulation. &quot;All Ding mit radt&quot; contains numerous passages in two voices, and so serves as an introduction to playing three-voice music. &quot;Wer gnad durch klaff&quot; is one of Schlick&#x27;s most straightforward intabulations, using most of the original material unchanged. Finally, &quot;Weg wart dein art&quot; is a free intabulation, with numerous ornaments, figuration and other embellishments. The vast majority of Schlick&#x27;s lute pieces are not exceptionally virtuosic, and are somewhat easier to perform than near-contemporary lute music by Hans Neusidler and Hans Judenkünig; however, the works in the &quot;Tabulaturen&quot; cannot be used as a basis to judge Schlick&#x27;s technique, since the book had a didactic aspect, and Schlick planned a second volume with more complex and difficult music.

==Influence==
Schlick was of the utmost importance in the early history of organ music in Germany. He was a much sought-after organ consultant, and while his blindness prevented him from doing much of the construction he was closely associated with organ-builders as an advisor; he tested new organs, performed widely, and was a strong influence among other composers at the time. His method of weaving contrapuntal lines around a cantus firmus, derived from a chorale tune, can be seen as foreshadowing the development of the chorale prelude in a later age. Schlick can be seen as the first figure in a long line of development which culminated in the music of J.S. Bach more than two hundred years later.

<text>In mathematics, a topological abelian group, or TAG, is a topological group that is also an abelian group.
That is, a TAG is both a group and a topological space, the group operations are continuous, and the group&#x27;s binary operation is commutative.

The theory of topological groups applies also to TAGs, but more can be done with TAGs. Locally compact TAGs, in particular, are used heavily in harmonic analysis.

<text>Spellfire: Master the Magic is an out-of-print collectible card game (CCG) created by TSR, Inc. and based on their popular &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role playing game. The game appeared first in April 1994, shortly after the introduction of &quot;&quot;, in the wake of the success enjoyed by trading card games. It was the second CCG to be released, preceding Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s second CCG &quot;&quot; by two months. More than one dozen expansions for the game were released, and the final expansion was released in October 1997.

==History==
After the successful launch of Wizards of the Coast&#x27;s &quot;Magic: The Gathering&quot; card game in 1993, TSR entered the fledgling CCG market with their take on a fantasy-themed card game in June 1994. &quot;Spellfire&quot; was designed by Steve Winter, Jim Ward, Dave Cook, and Tim Brown.

&quot;Spellfire&quot; used characters, locations, magic items, artifacts, monsters, events, and spells from the intellectual properties of TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; gaming worlds. However, it faced criticism immediately after release. One concern was TSR&#x27;s use of artwork on &quot;Spellfire&quot; cards that had already been used on TSR&#x27;s products like &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot; Magazine. Another source of debate was &quot;Spellfire&quot;&#x27;s use of completely different game mechanics.

==Editions==
The first release had a selection of 400 cards, which included cards based on the Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, and Greyhawk settings. The basic set was packaged as a double deck (55 cards per deck), with three different levels of rarity (Common, Uncommon, and Rare), and booster packs were also sold which contained 25 more cards that were not available in the basic set.

The second edition starter pack fixed some misprints and replaced 20 first edition cards with 20 different chase cards. The artwork for the new chase cards consisted mostly of photos with fantasy-related artifacts or people in costume. The rest of this set remained identical to the first edition. The &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, and &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot; booster series were released soon after the second edition. These were well received by players.

The third edition starter made some significant changes by adding powers to cards that previously had none, without changing the names and artwork. There were also significant rules corrections and updates. The &quot;Artifacts&quot;, &quot;Powers&quot;, &quot;Underdark&quot;, &quot;Runes &amp; Ruins&quot;, and &quot;Birthright&quot; booster series added many new dimensions to the game.

The fourth edition came in a red and black double-pack, and featured 520 cards pulled from each expansion set as well as the mainline set, with more than 200 new designs. Some cards that were not updated for the 3rd edition were changed with this release. The red box in this twin-deck pack included a 55-card deck that can be played as-is, while the black box included a set of revised rules and a booster pack of 12 cards from the &quot;Draconomicon&quot; expansion. By the time the fourth edition starter pack made its debut, the future of TSR was uncertain, leading to production problems. Three more booster series, &quot;Draconomicon&quot;, &quot;Nightstalkers&quot;, and &quot;Dungeons&quot;, were released. Though they all sold out immediately, these sets were produced in small quantities. Shortly thereafter, Wizards of the Coast bought out TSR.

Before it was discontinued, &quot;Spellfire&quot; was released in six languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, and French) and four editions, as well as having eleven expansions or &quot;booster sets&quot;. Several years after Wizards of the Coast acquired TSR, they announced that they would be re-releasing &quot;Spellfire&quot;, but the project was canceled.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Spellfire&quot; allowed for any number of players without a need for any rule changes. The players win by getting six Realms cards into play, and are able to play one each turn. Players can play one Holdings cards onto each Realm to add special qualities that help defend it from attack. Players use cards for Heroes, Wizards, Clerics, Monsters, Spells, Magic Items, Artifacts, Allies and Events to defend realms and also to attack the realms of other players. After a successful attack on a realm, it is considered razed and the Realm card is turned face down, and can only be restored through the use of other cards.

Realms - Realms represent kingdoms, cities, and empires from the AD&amp;D worlds that have sided with the player in question. The game can be won only by playing realms. It is common for a player&#x27;s opponents to attack his realms or to destroy them by other means, such as spells or events. Realms are played in a pyramid-shaped formation and must be played from front to back; i.e., the first realm played goes at the top (or point) of the pyramid, the next two go in the spaces below that (left then right), and the last three go in the spaces below that. These spaces are typically labeled by letter, with the first space &quot;A&quot; and the last &quot;F&quot;. In other words, the formation looks like this:

 A
 B C
 D E F

Champions - During his turn, a player may play champions into his &quot;pool.&quot; He may also outfit them with magic items and artifacts. Champions are probably the most important cards in the game, as they are used to attack and defend realms. The types of champions in the original game were heroes, monsters, clerics, and wizards; later, psionicists, regents, and thieves were added.

If the player at any time had no realms, razed or unrazed, in his formation, all of the cards in his pool would be discarded at the end of his turn.

==Reception==
Joel Halfwassen reviewed &quot;Spellfire&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #47 (Sept., 1994), rating it a 2 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Overall, TSR has flopped with this one. &quot;Spellfire&quot; is a game that&#x27;s good for 30 minutes to an hour, longer if played by followers of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. After that the game loses its appeal.&quot;

Scott Haring reviewed &quot;Spellfire&quot; for &quot;Pyramid&quot; #9, published in October 1994. Haring felt that the game was going to be &quot;just the first of what is sure to be a long line of games trying to take advantage of the market that &quot;Magic&quot; opened&quot;, but found that he was &quot;pleasantly surprised by &quot;Spellfire&quot;&quot;. He called the game &quot;quite good&quot;, and said that the lack of original art was tempered by TSR&#x27;s twenty years of art archives.

In 1995, &quot;Tomart&#x27;s&quot; remarked that &quot;Spellfire&quot; was released with card backs that weren&#x27;t identical between editions. For instance, &quot;First Edition&quot; and &quot;Second Edition&quot; had their names on their own respective card backs, noting these markings indicated the first &quot;appearance&quot; of the card rather than the set it was sold with. According to the authors, the cards looked &quot;innocent&quot; but made it &quot;easier to cheat&quot; because they were essentially &quot;marked cards&quot;.

Chris Baylis reviewed some of the game&#x27;s expansion sets for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, beginning with the &quot;Underdark&quot; booster pack, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. He found that virtually half of the 100-card set was accounted for by its main deck-building features, namely the high-level clerics, the surplus of clerical spells, a heavy influence of powerful monsters, and the underground Realms. He felt that these cards &quot;go a long way towards redressing the balance upset by &quot;Powers&quot; (set six), which made Psionicists almost insurmountable&quot;. Baylis reviewed the &quot;Runes &amp; Ruins&quot; expansion set, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Baylis comments that &quot;The most interesting cards of the set are the unarmed combat holds, kicks and punches, presented in a very unusual oil painting form and carrying a clenched fist symbol not yet in the rulebook.&quot; Baylis reviewed the &quot;Birthright&quot; booster pack, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Baylis concluded his review by saying: &quot;Overall the &quot;Birthright&quot; expansion is of very little interest to anyone other than card collectors, with only one of the 100 cards immediately springing to mind for possible consideration as an addition to my personal gaming deck.&quot; Baylis reviewed the &quot;Draconomicon&quot; booster pack, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. He noted that this expansion was mostly researched from the &quot;Draconomicon&quot; handbook from TSR: &quot;As you would expect with spellcasting Wyrms, it is accented towards magic, though the set is also bolstered by events and allies that are associated with Dragons and dragonkind.&quot;

Chris Baylis reviewed the fourth edition of &quot;Spellfire&quot; for the British magazine &quot;Arcane&quot;, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. He found the pack &quot;striking&quot;, considering the fourth edition to have &quot;the instant eye appeal that none of its predecessors could muster.&quot; He concluded by saying: &quot;Spellfire&quot; will never seriously rival &quot;Magic&quot;, but it does provide light, sometimes intense entertainment at a reasonable price, and when you come down to it, that is surely the essence of games playing.&quot;

<text>Mount Gilboa (; &quot;Jabal Jalbūʿ&quot; or &quot;Jabal Fuqqāʿa&quot;), sometimes referred to as the Mountains of Gilboa, is the name for a mountain range in Israel. It overlooks the Harod Valley (the eastern part of the larger Jezreel Valley) to the north, and the Jordan Valley and Hills to the southeast to the west, respectively.

==Etymology==
===Gilboa===
The meaning of the Hebrew name &quot;Gilboa&quot; is unknown. It is possible that it originates from a former, non-Semitic toponym, where &quot;gil&quot; referred to &quot;mountain,&quot; the second part consisting of an unknown element.

==In the Bible==
In the Hebrew Bible, Saul, Israel&#x27;s first king, led a charge against the Philistines at Mount Gilboa (). The battle ends with the king falling on his own sword and Saul&#x27;s sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Melchishua being killed in battle (). King David, who hears about the tragedy after the battle, curses the mountain:
:&quot;Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of choice fruits; for there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, anointed with oil&quot; ().

==History==
A minor battle between the army of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and Sultan Saladin took place at the foot of Mount Gilboa in 1183.

The 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut was fought at the foot of Mount Gilboa. The success of the Muslim Mamluks against the Mongols marked the end of the westward push of the Asian empire and ensured the survival of Muslim Egypt.

==Geography==
The formation has the shape of a boomerang, extending north from the highlands of Samaria on the West Bank and turning northwest at about half its length, thus separating the southeastern end of the Jezreel Valley to the west, from the Beit She&#x27;an and Ein Harod valleys to the east. The range&#x27;s highest peak rises 496 meters above sea level.

==Flora and fauna==

In 1976 and 1977, Mount Gilboa was counted to have about 170 plant species, including &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; (on the rocky slopes) and &quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot; (the shrub layer).

Every year from late February until late March the purple Hayne&#x27;s Iris, known in Hebrew as the Gilboa Iris (&quot;Irus ha-Gilboa&quot;), blooms on the mountain. Two nature reserves have been declared on the ridge: the Gilboa Iris nature reserve in 1970, covering , and the eastern Gilboa reserve in 2005, covering .

It also has a very diverse animal species range, with 14 reptile, 7 rodent, 31 bird and 13 isopod species.

<text>The brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani), or western brush rabbit, or Californian brush rabbit, is a species of cottontail rabbit found in western coastal regions of North America, from the Columbia River in Oregon to the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. Its range extends as far east as the eastern sides of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges.

==Description and taxonomy==

The brush rabbit is a small rabbit with short legs and a short tail. It is dark gray on the sides and back, and pale gray on the belly and the underside of the tail. The whiskers are mostly black, although some have white tips. Adult rabbits measure anywhere from in length, and range in weight from .

Large numbers of geographically defined subspecies have been proposed, including in Oregon, &quot;ubericolor&quot;; in California, &quot;cinerascens&quot;, &quot;mariposae&quot;, &quot;riparius&quot;, &quot;tehamae&quot; and &quot;trowbridgii&quot;; and in Baja California, &quot;cerrosensis&quot;, &quot;exiguus&quot;, &quot;howelli&quot;, &quot;peninsularis&quot; and &quot;rosaphagus&quot;. Subspecies &quot;bachmani&quot;, &quot;macrorhinus&quot; and &quot;virgulti&quot; are less geographically restricted. Of the various proposed subspecies, only the following are currently recognized, the others are synonyms: &quot;S. b. ubericolor&quot;, &quot;S. b. cinerascens&quot;, &quot;S. b. bachmani&quot;, &quot;S. b. exiguus&quot;, &quot;S. b. howelli&quot;, &quot;S. b. cerrosensis&quot;.

It has been noted that numbers of the eastern cottontail were brought west to reproduce and provide a food source for the settlers. The interbreeding of the two species has occurred where the brush rabbit has in parts of Oregon developed the white cottontail although retaining its smaller size.

==Habitat and ecology==
Brush rabbits require dense bramble clumps or other thick, brushy habitat. These bramble clumps often have extensive networks of trails and runways. The species occasionally uses burrows made by other species, but does not dig its own. The home range is very small, less than .

Brush rabbits most commonly live in chaparral vegetation, but are also found in oak and conifer habitats. In the San Francisco Bay Area, the brush rabbit was found to concentrate its activities at the edge of brush and exhibits much less use of grassy areas. It uses the interior brush of the wilderness, and this may be a better environment for it than the chaparral one. Studies done on the brush rabbit in Oregon also showed that it rarely left the brushy areas it inhabits. Brush may be used more in the drier seasons, while grasses are used in the wetter seasons in relation to growth of annual vegetation. Use of habitat also probably is related to the breeding season.

==Distribution==
The brush rabbit is confined to the Pacific Coast, from the Columbia River in the north to the tip of Baja, Mexico in the south. It does not occur east of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountain ranges.

==Behavior==
Brush rabbits forage alone or in small groups. They can be seen sunning in the mid-morning, but are otherwise secretive and wary. They thump the ground with their back feet when startled.

The brush rabbit feeds mainly on grasses and forbs, especially green clover. It also eats berries and browses on shrubs.

A trapping study of the brush rabbit in the Berkeley Hills in Northern California indicated that males had larger home ranges than females at all times of the year, and especially in May when females were moving the least. The home ranges of the brush rabbit are estimated to average just under for males and just under for females. The shapes of these home ranges are usually circular, but depending on the vegetation, can differ in size and shape. Range use probably is not circular in shape or uniform, but rather consists of a series of runways that directly connects high-use areas within brush habitat. Intraspecific sociospatial behavior appears to be variable and may reflect local resource conditions. Several rabbits have been observed to feed in the same area simultaneously, but maintained interindividual distances of before aggressive chases occurred. Females tended to not overlap, while males showed relatively extensive overlapping; this may indicate that females are territorial. Groups of brush rabbits may serve social purposes, such as predator detection, but this has not been proven.

==Reproduction==
The brush rabbit&#x27;s breeding season varies from north to south. In Oregon, breeding begins in February and ends in August, while in California it begins in December and ends in May or June. Litter size also varies between regions. Studies have found the average litter size in Oregon to be 2.8, in northern and central California to be 3.5, and in west central California to be 4.0. The brush rabbit is one of the less fecund members of the genus, producing about 15 young in five to six litters per year. The gestation period of the brush rabbit is about 22 days, and kits are altricial. Male brush rabbits breed from around October to November through June to July. The brush rabbit&#x27;s most reproductive activity occurs from January to April. In the areas of San Francisco, pregnant female brush rabbits can be found from the first week of December until the ends of June. Female brush rabbits have about four litters per year.

==Predators and survival techniques==
Its predators include cougar, coyote, fox, bobcat, weasel, and various raptors and snakes. Its survival strategies include remaining immobile when in brushy areas, and zig-zag running when found in open spaces. It also climbs onto low branches to escape from predators and other perceived threats.

==Human interaction and conservation status==
The brush rabbit is not hunted as are many other cottontail species, probably because of its small size. It is not a major cause of damage to crops or other human developments in its habitat.

While the overall population of brush rabbits is stable, one of its subspecies, the riparian brush rabbit (&quot;S. b. riparius&quot;), is listed as an endangered species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Formerly numerous along the San Joaquin River and Stanislaus River, it is now reduced to a population of a few hundred in the Caswell Memorial State Park and is being reintroduced to the adjacent San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge in the San Joaquin Valley, California. This population has been negatively impacted by the destruction of the riparian habitat. Another subspecies, the San José brush rabbit, is considered critically endangered.

==Myxomatosis==
Brush rabbits are a natural carrier of the &quot;myxoma virus&quot;, a poxvirus in the genus &quot;Leporipoxvirus&quot;. This virus causes only a mild disease in brush rabbits, but causes a severe and usually fatal disease called myxomatosis in European (pet) rabbits. The disease is usually transmitted from one rabbit to another by biting insects.

== Subspecies ==
Three geographic subspecies of the brush rabbit are acknowledged as follows.

=== &quot;Sylvilagus bachmani tehamae&quot; ===
This subspecies of &quot;Sylvilagus bachmani&quot; is geographically found from the Rogue River Valley, Jackson County, Oregon, through Northern California, along the inner coast ranges, to southern Lake County and along the Sierra Nevada to Placer County. It is also found in the Sacramento Valley.

The subspecies is medium in size, paler in color, has larger ears and shorter hind feet.

=== &quot;Sylvilagus bachmani macrorhinus&quot; ===
This subspecies of &quot;Sylvilagus bachmani&quot; is geographically found in west-central California—from San Francisco to the north end of Monterey Bay and inland from Solano County south to Santa Clara County. 

It is smaller in size but has longer ears.

=== &quot;Sylvilagus bachmani riparius&quot; ===
This subspecies of &quot;Sylvilagus bachmani&quot; is geographically found on the west side of the San Joaquin River in northern Stanislaus and southern San Joaquin counties. This subspecies is pale and gray-sided.

&quot;Sylvilagus bachmani riparius&quot; is listed as an endangered species both by California and federally, primarily due to habitat destruction. In the San Joaquin Valley, over 93% of the habitat was destroyed for urban and agricultural use. A population of riparian brush rabbits has moved into restored habitat in the new Dos Rios State Park.

<text>Museum of the Game, which includes the Killer List of Videogames (KLOV), is a website featuring an online encyclopedia devoted to cataloging arcade games past and present. It is the video game department of the International Arcade Museum, and has been referred to as &quot;the IMDb for players&quot;.

==Overview==
The KLOV&#x27;s encyclopedia contains extensive entries for more than 4,650 machines made from 1971 through the present. It has cabinet, control panel and marquee images, screen shots and even 3D models of the machine in some cases. Entries have machine technical information, a game description, cabinet information, lists cheats, tricks and bugs, discusses conversions and game play, lists trivia and fix information and discusses the game&#x27;s legacy (such as sequels or similar games it inspired). Nearly 1000 entries even have the complete technical manual and/or schematics available for download.

The KLOV&#x27;s entries are heavily weighted for classic arcade games: that is, games released during the golden age of arcade games. Most arcade games have an entry, though entries for newer games tend to be spotty. The more popular a game was, the more extensive the entry is likely to be.

The encyclopedia database is actually a subset of that on the International Arcade Museum&#x27;s web site, which expands on the videogame entries with an additional 9,000 entries on other types of coin-operated machines such as pinball machines, slot machines, vending, trade stimulators, and scales.

The site features a &quot;Machine of the Moment&quot; and maintains a list of &quot;The Top 100 Videogames&quot;. The site also hosts message boards where collectors and fans can ask questions and get answers from experts, and buy or sell arcade games and parts. It also publishes news related to arcade games.

==History==
1980s:
In the mid-1980s that a master list of coin-operated video games was slowly built by arcade enthusiasts communicating via dial-up bulletin board systems.

1991:
This text list became &quot;Coin-Ops A Poppin&#x27; - Killer List of Videogames&quot; in 1991. Its first known maintainer was Mike Hughey, and its second, Jeff Hansen.

1992:
Jonathan Deitch took over the management of both lists in 1992, which then received frequent updates during his watch. He moved the lists into their first structured database using the database part of the software package AppleWorks on an Apple II computer. The KLOV was distributed via BBS systems, as well as via the Internet Usenet group &quot;rec.games.video.arcade&quot;, both of which also provided a reference source for updates to the list.

1994:
In 1994 or 1995, a classic arcade game collector in Minnesota by the name of Brian Johnson volunteered to take on upkeep of the list and became the new &quot;KLOV Keeper&quot;, a title used to refer to the maintainer of the KLOV by the Usenet collector community at the time. The KLOV launched as a full brand on or before November 9, 1995. Johnson was instrumental in developing the KLOV&#x27;s web site from a simple list to a full web-based encyclopedia. Johnson&#x27;s efforts included breaking up the list into a complete online encyclopedia with distinct pages for each entry, rewriting all the content, including pictures in as many listings as was possible, and in general creating a user-friendly and searchable website. Visitors could submit suggested changes to Johnson, who could then edit any entries by hand.

1999:
In late 1999, the KLOV finally reached 2000 entries. By this time the increasing level of submissions and suggestions was becoming nearly unmanageable for any single person to keep up with, and the work load began to exceed Johnson&#x27;s available time.

2000:
In January 2000, Greg McLemore became the KLOV Keeper. His company, WebMagic, registered the Internet domain name &#x27;KLOV.com&#x27; for the site on January 13, and continues to provide substantial financial support for the KLOV to this day as a chief sponsor.

Community message forums were quickly added to the site, as was a new moderated wiki-style information update system to allow multiple people to administer user contributions. As before, users contributions were screened before being added, though updates were now tracked and submissions would be automatically tied to the record they belonged to.

2001:
The following year brought expanded support for hand held mobile devices. After a long beta testing period, version 1.0 of the &quot;KLOV for Palm 7&quot; application was released on May 25. This 100% free application allowed anyone with a Palm VII wireless PDA to access KLOV game entries with text and graphics while on the road. This application is no longer maintained since more modern cell phones such as the iPhone and Palm Pre can directly display the KLOV&#x27;s offerings via built-in web browsers.

Additionally, after receiving well over 100,000 messages, the KLOV&#x27;s popular message forums were updated in 2001, and the new system, have since received an additional 850,000+ messages to date.

2002:
In December 2002, the International Arcade Museum was formed to expand on work done by the KLOV over the previous decade. Greg McLemore remained the KLOV Keeper and WebMagic remained a chief financial contributor. The KLOV officially became part of The International Arcade Museum.

2006:
On January 23, 2006, The International Arcade Museum assumed operation of the Video Arcade Preservation Society (VAPS), the leading collector&#x27;s group and census taker serving the coin-operated video game community. The VAPS.org web site was also converted to work on the LAMP platform, and links between the KLOV and VAPS were created. Each individual game&#x27;s entry in KLOV has a dynamic account of the Video Arcade Preservation Society&#x27;s (VAPS) current statistics regarding collector ownership of that particular game.

2009:
In 2009, the KLOV&#x27;s message forums were upgraded and moved as the forums were serving both sites and have sections about all types of coin-operated machines in addition to videogame sections. The old forum URL continues to work as a redirect to the new address.

<text>José Bento Renato Monteiro Lobato (; 18 April 1882 – 4 July 1948) was one of Brazil&#x27;s most influential writers, mostly for his children&#x27;s books set in the fictional Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (Yellow Woodpecker Farm) but he had been previously a prolific writer of fiction, a translator and an art critic. He also founded one of Brazil&#x27;s first publishing houses (Companhia Editora Nacional) and was a supporter of nationalism.

Lobato was born in Taubaté, São Paulo. He is best known for a set of educational but entertaining children&#x27;s books, which comprise about half of his production. The other half, consisting of a number of novels and short tales for adult readers, was less popular but marked a watershed in Brazilian literature.

==Biography==
Most of his children&#x27;s books were set in the &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot; (&quot;Yellow Woodpecker Farm&quot; or &quot;Yellow Woodpecker Ranch&quot;), a small farm in the countryside, and featured the elderly ranch owner &quot;Dona Benta&quot; (&quot;Mrs. Benta&quot;), her two grandchildren – a girl, &quot;Lúcia&quot; (&quot;Lucia&quot;) who is always referred to only by her nickname, &quot;Narizinho&quot; (&quot;Little Nose&quot;, because she had a turned-up nose) and a boy, &quot;Pedrinho&quot; (&quot;Little Pete&quot;) — and a black servant and cook, &quot;Tia Nastácia&quot; (&quot;Aunt Anastacia&quot;). These real characters were complemented by entities created or animated by the children&#x27;s imagination: the irreverent rag doll &quot;Emília&quot; (&quot;Emilia&quot;) and the aristocratic and learned puppet made of corncob &quot;Visconde de Sabugosa&quot; (roughly &quot;Viscount Corncob&quot;), the cow &quot;Mocha&quot;, the donkey &quot;Conselheiro&quot; (&quot;Counsellor&quot;), the pig &quot;Rabicó&quot; (&quot;Short-Tail&quot;) and the rhinoceros &quot;Quindim&quot; (Quindim is a Brazilian dessert), &quot;Saci Pererê&quot; (a black, pipe-smoking, one-legged character of Brazilian folklore) and Cuca (an evil monster invoked by Brazilian mothers at night to convince their kids to go to bed). The adventures mostly develop elsewhere: either in fantasy worlds invented by the children, or in stories told by Dona Benta in evening sessions.

Many of these books are educational, teaching things through the mouth of Mrs. Benta and by smart questions and remarks, by her young and attentive audience. They addressed subjects which children often do not like at school, such as mathematics, grammar, national and world history, geography, astronomy, Greek mythology, and so on. In other books, the author, who was a skeptic, a rationalist, an internationalist and had anti-war positions (but at the same time being strongly patriotic and conservative), passes his views on the world, humanity and politics to his young readers. In other books, he tells in an easy to understand way the classics of literature, such as Aesop&#x27;s fables, Don Quixote and Peter Pan.

He created a rich crossover using elements from many sources, literature, movies, mythology and cartoons. He was widely imaginative, such as in his books &quot;A Chave do Tamanho&quot; (&quot;The Sizing Switch&quot;) and &quot;A Reforma da Natureza&quot; (&quot;Reforming Nature&quot;), where he speculated on the consequences of all humans suddenly decreasing in size, and on what would happen if Emilia and Viscount would get hold of a scientific method to change the genes of animals and plants for rational or irrational purposes, with catastrophic results.

Monteiro Lobato&#x27;s books were turned into widely popular TV programs — including five series of Sítio do Picapau Amarelo adventures, one in 1952 on TV Tupi, another in 1964 on TV Cultura, one in 1967 on Rede Bandeirantes, another on Rede Globo in 1977, and the last version in 2001 also on Rede Globo. The last is known in other countries under the title &quot;Pirlimpimpim&quot;. In 2012 &quot;Rede Globo&quot; and Brazilian producer &quot;Mixer&quot; was to produce an animated series inspired by Lobato&#x27;s children&#x27;s books.

Lobato was also an influential journalist and publisher, wrote regularly for several newspapers and magazines, and was a noted and respected art critic. In fact, he provoked a public controversy when he harshly criticized the writers, poets, painters and musicians who in 1922 promoted a Modern Art Week (Semana da Arte Moderna), which was also a watershed event in Brazilian culture in the 20th century. In 1919, he acquired the &quot;Revista do Brasil,&quot; one of the first Brazilian cultural magazines, and founded, in 1920, his own publishing house. Later, he helped to found and was a partner in two of the most important independent Brazilian publishing houses, the &quot;Companhia Nacional&quot; and the &quot;Editora Brasiliense&quot;.

Politically, Lobato was strongly in favor of a state monopoly for iron and oil exploration in Brazil and battled publicly for it between 1931 and 1939. For his libertarian views, he was arrested by the then dictatorial government of Getúlio Vargas in 1941. This movement, called &quot;O Petróleo é Nosso&quot; (Oil Belongs to Us) was highly successful, and the same Getúlio Vargas, after being democratically elected president, created Petrobras in 1952.

Lobato founded a cultural and literary magazine, &quot;Fundamentos&quot;, which existed between 1948 and 1955. He died in São Paulo in 1948.

==Racism in his work and thoughts==
Lobato has been posthumously accused of racism, due to the portrayal and treatment of black people in several of his works. In 2010 a Brazilian educator attempted to legally ban &quot;Caçadas de Pedrinho&quot; from Brazilian junior schools for the prejudicial narrative and terms contained in the novel. For example, Lobato describes Aunt Nastácia (a mulatta), climbing up &quot;the pole of Saint Pedro as an old monkey&quot;, and that &quot;no one would escape&quot; a jaguar&#x27;s attack, including &quot;Aunt Nastácia, of black flesh.&quot;

An academic analysis made by the Instituto de Pesquisas e Estudos Sociais at the Rio de Janeiro State University characterizes Monteiro Lobato as a &quot;dangerously influential racist working on the scholastic area&quot;, citing a letter Lobato sent to Toledo Neiva, in which he complains about &quot;a country [Brazil] where men don&#x27;t have strength enough to organize a Ku Klux Klan&quot;, and comparing it to the United States by mentioning André Siegfried, &quot;glad that they&#x27;re not a second Brazil. Some day, justice will be done to the Ku Klux Klan.&quot;

<doc id="584160" wikidata="Q625179" url="?curid=584160" title="Liu Yong (Song dynasty)">
<text>Liu Yong () (approximately 984–1053), was a Chinese poet during the Northern Song Dynasty. His original name was Liu Sanbian (Chinese: 柳三变), courtesy name Jingzhuang (Chinese: 景庄); he later changed his name to Liu Yong, courtesy name Qiqing (Chinese: 耆卿). He was born in Chong&#x27;an (崇安), Fujian, but his ancestral home was in present-day Yongji, Shanxi.

Liu Yong was ambitious to make achievements and contribute to serving the country from an early age. He had received an education for imperial examination, which laid the foundation for his poetry writing. However, he failed four times and his career as an officer was middling. He spent many leisure days with Gējì to have fun, which influenced his writing style and images in his poems.

Liu Yong was the first poet who reformed Song Ci (宋词) poetry in a comprehensive way. The trend of long-form Song Ci poetry originated from him. Moreover, he has made great efforts in creating the poetry genre &quot;Slow poetry&quot; or &quot;Slow song form&quot; (Chinese: 慢词), and made full use of vulgar words and common sayings. The genre combined mundane images with graceful descriptions. The use of incisive narrations, plain images and other artistic expressions by Liu Yong has made a profound impact on Song Ci poetry in later ages. Liu Yong was also a representative of the subtle and concise style (婉约派) in classical Chinese literature.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Since there is no credible source explicitly recording Liu Yong&#x27;s date of birth, scholars speculated that Liu Yong was born approximately in the 980s (between 984-987). At that time, Liu Yong&#x27;s father Liu Yi was an imperial court officer managing a town named &quot;Feixian&quot;.

Since he was born into an official family, Liu Yong received a high-quality education when he was young. In 990, Liu Yong moved to Quanzhou while his father was transferred there.

Liu Yong showed his talent in Chinese literature from an early age. When Liu Yong was ten years old, he wrote his first article &quot;exhorting (the importance of) learning&quot; (劝学文). And later in 998, Liu Yong wrote his first relatively well-known poem, &quot;Writing Zhongfeng Temple&quot; (题中峰寺). Then, he gave the first trial on Song Ci poetry in 1001. The poetry was named &quot;Clouds on Wu Mountain, Hiking in Caves&quot; (巫山一段云·六六真游洞). It extolled the beauty of the landscape in Wuyi Mountain, which was located near his hometown.

=== Staying at Hangzhou and Suzhou ===

In the fifth year of the Reign of Emperor Xianping (1002), Liu Yong left his hometown planning to take the examination hosted by the Ministry of Rites (礼部) in the capital city Dongjing (now Kaifeng). However, while on the way to Dongjing, he greatly enjoyed the life in flourishing cities like Hangzhou and Suzhou, so he decided to provisionally stay. He immersed himself in viewing the beauty of nature there, and indulged in romantic relationships with courtesans. In order to make a living in Hangzhou, Liu Yong wrote lyrics for Jiaofang songs. With his great musical and literary talents, his lyrics was extremely popular among the public. However, his lyrics with vulgar words and romantic themes were not accepted by other poets, scholars, or the upper class. They judged and criticized Liu Yong and his inverse actions to Chinese conceptions of etiquette (Confucian culture), which also brought a negative impact on his later career.

In 1003, Liu Yong wrote a poem named &quot;Viewing Sea Tides&quot; (望海潮·东南形胜) as a greeting letter to Sun He, a competent and well-known officer in Song Dynasty. The poetry&#x27;s popularity swept the region rapidly after its release. Since then, Liu Yong&#x27;s talent in literacy had become more widely known by people. Between the years 1004 and 1007, Liu Yong wrote three poems in terms of recalling the memories he had while living in Suzhou and Hangzhou.

=== Failing the imperial examination ===
In 1008, Liu Yong went to the capital city, Bianjing (Dongjing), for the imperial examination in Spring, 1009. Though Liu Yong was confident in his talent and ability for positioning in a high rank and successfully becoming an imperial court officer. However, the result turned out that he failed his first trial. To express his depression and discontent, he wrote one of his most famous poems &quot;Crane Into the Sky&quot; (鹤冲天·黄金榜上). But still holding hope for the next trial, Liu Yong wrote the poem &quot;Like fish in water&quot; (如鱼水·帝里疏散) after a period of time.

In 1015, Liu Yong took the imperial examination for the second time but failed again to achieve the Jinshi degree. Jinshi was the honor for those who passed the final imperial examination. He became more frustrated and dejected for his failures in both love and career. &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Music” (征部乐·雅欢幽会) was written down at this time.

In 1018, he failed again by being rejected by the emperor. Officers with an indiscreet private life were criticized in ancient China. Liu Yong&#x27;s actions of writing lyrics about &quot;qinglou&quot; and his frequent contact with Gejis had damaged his reputation, inducing his failure in examinations several times.

In 1024, after his fourth failure, Liu Yong left the capital in annoyance. Facing the departure with his lover, he wrote another poem later made famous, &quot;Yu Lin Ling&quot; (雨霖铃·寒蝉凄切).

=== Away from the Capital ===
After Liu Yong left the capital Bianjing, he went to southern China. Along his way to the south, he restarted his business in writing lyrics for songs, and the popularity of his lyrics and poetry rose as time went on. During this time, Liu Yong moved from place to place, writing several poems to express his sentiments on the fast-passing years and nostalgia for the young adult period.

In 1029, Liu Yong came back to Bianjing, but left again feeling grieved that things were still flourishing in the Capital, but people changed.

In 1034, the imperial examination loosened its standards with Emperor Renzong&#x27;s governance. Liu Yong returned to the capital from Ezhou to take the imperial examination again.

=== Career as an officer ===
In 1034, Liu Yong, who was about 40, finally achieved the Jinshi degree and began his career as an officer. In February, Liu Yong went from Bianjing to Muzhou on assignment from the Song imperial court. However, the suggestion from Liu Yong&#x27;s higher-ups to promote him was turned down. The reason given was &quot;no positive achievement yet&quot;, meaning the reputation accumulated in earlier years was further affecting Liu Yong&#x27;s career even though his talent and ability were approved.

Liu Yong successively served as officers in multiple positions afterward. In 1037, he was promoted to the position of Yuhang county magistrate. He did well in managing the region and was loved by the people. In 1039, Liu Yong was appointed as the officer at the &quot;Hsiao-feng Salt Monopoly (晓峰盐场)&quot; in Zhejiang province. Touched by the tough lives of the salt workers there, he wrote the poem &quot;Song of Boiling Sea-water&quot;, which made a huge impact on society and earned him positivity as a &quot;renowned officer (名宦)&quot; by the people.

In 1050, Liu Yong served as &quot;Assistant Director of Military Colonies&quot; (屯田员外郎), which was the highest official position of his career.

== Works ==

=== Tune patterns ===
At least 127 kinds of tune patterns were used in Liu Yong&#x27;s Ci, which were far more than other Ci poets at his stage. And even his works in the same tune patterns were not the same in format. They might not strictly follow the prescribed tune pattern and are slightly different in word counts and line divisions. What&#x27;s more, Liu Yong invented some tune patterns and adventurously tried a lot of obscure tune patterns, which demonstrated his flexibility in creation.

=== Themes ===

==== Romantic themes ====
The first most popular theme among early scholar-poets was &quot;boudoir feelings.&quot; These themes, however, are frequently conveyed in a more ornate and dramatic way, thus separating sensuality from reality. Liu Yong&#x27;s lyrics are unique in its genuineness and directness.  Liu Yong&#x27;s works are unique in their genuineness and directness. In the works designed for courtesan performances, he tended to use highly vernacular expressions that truly and straightforwardly expressed a man&#x27;s frailties. His living experiences in the Qinglous(青楼) and his romantic relationships with courtesans not only helped him understand the lives and feelings of the women from the lower class, but also kept him up to date on the latest romantic Song Ci poetry.

The Siku Quanshu (Chinese: 四库全书 Synopsis of the Four Imperial Libraries) thus comments, &quot;The Ci was originally a kind of seductive music, and Liu Yong&#x27;s work was charming and intimately emotional, allowing people easy access to it, so though it is quite flawed by its vulgarity, there has been no end of people who have delighted in it.&quot; The following work &quot;Feng ch&#x27;i wu 凤栖梧&quot; is one of his representative romantic Song Ci poetry.

===== To the tune &quot;Phoenix in the Phoenix Tree&quot; =====
(Feng ch&#x27;i wu 凤栖梧)

For long I stand at the window in the gentle breeze Staring into infinity at spring melancholy Somberly growing on the horizon. In the fading light, mist-shimmer on the grass Who can understand why I lean, wordless, on the balustrade?

伫倚危楼风细细，望极春愁，黯黯生天际。草色烟光残照里，无言谁会凭阑意。

I am determined to be reckless, plan a drunk. Here is wine, here is song. But in forced mirth is no flavor. It doesn&#x27;t matter after all that my girdle grows looser She is worth being haggard for.

拟把疏狂图一醉⑺，对酒当歌，强乐还无味。衣带渐宽终不悔，为伊消得人憔悴。

==== Feelings about his life ====
Another common topic in Liu Yong&#x27;s work was about his feelings in life, including his self-pity about his career and the agony of his loneliness. The following lyric &quot;Ho ch&#x27;ung t&#x27;ien 鹤冲天&quot; expressed his resentment after failing the imperial examination and the spurning of merit and flame.

===== To the tune &quot;Crane in the Sky&quot; =====
(Ho ch&#x27;ung t&#x27;ien 鹤冲天)

On the golden announcement board, My name failed to head the list. Neglected in an enlightened age Where is a good man to turn? If you fail to get ahead Why not let yourself go and have some fun? No need to weigh loss and gain The songwriter of genius Is an unofficial minister of state.

黄金榜上，偶失龙头望。明代暂遗贤，如何向。未遂风云便，争不恣游狂荡。何须论得丧？才子词人，自是白衣卿相。

The misty flowers in the lanes are, as on a painted screen. Happily someone there I know Worth paying a visit, To embrace red and green; In romantic affairs Finding a lifetime&#x27;s pleasure. Verdant spring is gone in a moment And I am ready to exchange An ephemeral name for a cup of wine and a soft song.

烟花巷陌，依约丹青屏障。幸有意中人，堪寻访。且恁偎红倚翠，风流事，平生畅。青春都一饷⒂。忍把浮名，换了浅斟低唱。

==== Reflect the ordinary people&#x27;s suffering ====
He cared about the hardships of working people&#x27;s lives and sympathized with their sufferings. For example, the following poem &quot;Song of Boiling Seawater (Chinese：煮海歌）,&quot; is a heptasyllabic poem written during his service as an officier at the &quot;Hsiao-feng Salt Monopoly （Chinese：晓峰盐场）.&quot; This poem criticizes repressive rulers and laments the misery of salt workers.

===== Song of Boiling Sea-Water =====
What do they live on, the people who boil sea water,

The women with no silk to weave, the men no plows?

How fragile the source of their livelihood!

When you finish boiling it in the cauldron, you pay it for taxes.

Spring and summer, year after year, the tide covers the shore,

When the tide recedes they scrape the sand into islands.

Dried by wind, baked by the sun, it grows more salt,

Washed with sea water, it makes a stream of brine;

As the brine thickens, they continuously sample the taste.

They go deep into endless hills to collect firewood

Regardless of panther tracks, tiger trails.

They depart with the sunrise and return at sunset;

Carried on the back or by boat, with no rest ever,

The wood they throw into the great furnace, blazing hot,

Burning by day, flaming through the night, until heaped up high

At last, is the snow they have made from the ocean&#x27;s waves,

From pools of brine to flying flakes of frost.

For food to eat they had no choice but to borrow.

Now, weighed in at the official station, it brings a paltry price,

And every borrowed string of cash must be repaid with ten.

Around and around it goes and never stops

Government taxes still unpaid, the private rents now due.

They drive their wives, push their sons to work their share;

Their form is human, but their complexion is vegetable.

How bitter is life for the people who boil the water of the sea!

How can they make their parents rich, their sons not poor?

Under this dynasty not a creature loses its place;

I wish the royal kindness might spread to the shores of the sea,

Wash weapons and armor clean, put a stop to taxes in kind

So that our ruler may have a surplus and end the tax on salt.

In time of peace if the ministers will stick to salt!

We will be back to the happy days of Hsia, Shang, and Chou.

== Influence ==
Liuyong had a seminal influence on the development of Ci (Song Ci poetry). Due to his rich life experiences with disillusionment in his career and living among ordinary people, his ci has diverse contents and themes. So, he successfully expands the connotation context and aesthetic interest of Ci. Since his lyrics contain a lot of colloquial expressions that are easy to understand, his lyrics have extensive circulation among general people, which can be proved by a well-known proverb &quot;where there is well water [where people reside], there are Liu&#x27;s songs.&quot; Liu Yong was not only one of the most popular Ci poet in Song dynasty, but also a significant milestone in Ci genre. He carried forward Slow Ci (Slow Poetry), making them not only more varied in format but also richer in content. His innovative use of vivid colloquialisms in Ci has made Ci more accessible to the public.

<text>Peter Grant (5 April 1935 – 21 November 1995) was an English music manager, best known as the manager of Led Zeppelin from their creation in 1968 to their breakup in 1980. With his intimidating size and weight, confrontational manner, knowledge and experience, Grant was able to procure strong and unprecedented deals for Led Zeppelin, and is widely credited with improving pay and conditions for all musicians in dealings with concert promoters. Grant has been described as &quot;one of the shrewdest and most ruthless managers in rock history&quot;.

Born and largely brought up in the south London suburb of South Norwood, England by his mother, he worked variously as a stagehand, bouncer, wrestler, bit-part actor, and UK tour manager for acts such as Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent and the Animals, before getting involved briefly in band management with the Nashville Teens and the Yardbirds.

He was also a record executive for Swan Song Records.

== Early life ==
Grant was born in the south London suburb of South Norwood, England. His mother Dorothy worked as a secretary. His father, Samuel Grant, was Jewish, and his mother, Dorothy, was of Russian-Jewish ancestry. He attended Sir Walter St John School in Grayshott, Hampshire, before the Second World War, and completed his schooling at Charterhouse School in Godalming, Surrey, after the evacuation. After the war, Grant returned to Norwood until leaving at the age of 13, when he became a sheet metal factory worker in Croydon. He left that job after a few weeks, and then obtained employment on Fleet Street delivering photographs for Reuters.

Grant was soon attracted to the entertainment industry, and worked as a stagehand for the Croydon Empire Theatre until 1953, when he was called up for national service in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, reaching the rank of corporal. He worked briefly as an entertainment manager at a hotel in Jersey before being employed as a bouncer and doorman at London&#x27;s 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar, where Cliff Richard, Adam Faith, Tommy Steele and others got their start. Co-owner of the 2i&#x27;s bar, professional wrestler Paul Lincoln, suggested and assisted Grant appear on television as a wrestler under the titles &quot;Count Massimo&quot; and &quot;Count Bruno Alassio of Milan,&quot; using his 6 ft 2 in frame to good effect. This kindled his enthusiasm for acting, and he was hired by film studios as a bit part actor, stuntman and body double.

== Acting career ==
Between 1958 and 1963, Grant appeared in a number of films, including &quot;A Night to Remember &quot;(1958), playing a crew member on the &quot;Titanic&quot;; &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), playing a British commando; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), playing a palace guard. He also appeared in television shows such as &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Crackerjack&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, and &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;. He was Robert Morley&#x27;s double on many of the actor&#x27;s films. The money he made from these ventures was invested in his own entertainment transport business. As the acting roles dried up, Grant made more money taking groups such as the Shadows to their concerts.

== Artist management ==
In 1963, Grant was hired by promoter Don Arden along with John Schatt to be the British tour manager for artists such as Bo Diddley, the Everly Brothers, Little Richard, Brian Hyland, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent and the Animals. By 1964, Grant had started to manage his own acts including the Nashville Teens, an all-girl group called She Trinity, the New Vaudeville Band, The Jeff Beck Group, Terry Reid and Stone the Crows. His management was established in the same 155 Oxford Street office used by his friend, record producer Mickie Most, who had previously worked with Grant at the 2i&#x27;s Coffee Bar. Most and Grant together set up RAK Music Management, an offshoot of Most&#x27;s Rak Records.

In late 1966, Simon Napier-Bell asked Grant to take over management of the Yardbirds, who were constantly touring yet struggling financially. Mickie Most had suggested to Napier-Bell that Grant would be an asset to the Yardbirds, but as it happened his arrival was too late to save the band. The experience, however, did give him ideas which were put to good use later with Led Zeppelin. As he explained:

Grant&#x27;s no-nonsense approach to promoters, and his persuasive presence, were influential in the Yardbirds making money from concerts for the first time. Grant travelled closely with the Yardbirds, ensuring that all costs were kept to a minimum, that members were paid on time, and that the band retained artistic control. Unlike most other managers at the time who rarely set foot in a music venue, Grant&#x27;s approach was hands-on.

== Led Zeppelin ==

The Yardbirds dissolved in 1968, all band members departing except guitarist Jimmy Page, who constructed a new group consisting of himself, Robert Plant, John Bonham and John Paul Jones to fulfill a contractual agreement to tour Europe, and were allowed by the other Yardbird members to use the name &quot;The New Yardbirds&quot;. After the tour, the agreement to use the name expired, and Chris Dreja wrote Page a &quot;cease and desist&quot; notice, so the group chose the name Led Zeppelin, with Grant assuming the role of their manager. His trust in and loyalty to Led Zeppelin was such that his managerial arrangement with the band was via a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement.

It is doubtful whether Led Zeppelin would have been as successful without Grant as their manager. He negotiated the group&#x27;s sizeable five-year record contract with Atlantic Records, and his business philosophy would eventually pay off for the label. Grant strongly believed that bands could make more money, and have more artistic merit, by focusing their efforts on albums rather than singles. Live performances were deemed more important than television appearances – if one wanted to see Led Zeppelin, one had to experience their performances in person.

Led Zeppelin&#x27;s particular success in the United States can partly be credited to Grant&#x27;s keen sense of US audiences and the vast underground movement that was sweeping the country. It was his knowledge of the American touring scene that thrust Led Zeppelin into the forefront of the burgeoning American rock market, and under his stewardship the great majority of Led Zeppelin concerts were performed in the United States, resulting in massive profits for the group. He ensured that the vast bulk of ticket profits wound up in the hands of the band rather than in the hands of promoters and booking agents, and is reported to have secured 90% of gate money from concerts performed by the band, an unprecedented feat. By taking this approach he set a new standard for artist management, &quot;single-handedly pioneer[ing] the shift of power from the agents and promoters to the artists and management themselves.&quot;

Grant&#x27;s determination to protect the financial interests of Led Zeppelin was also reflected by the sometimes extraordinary measures he took to combat the practice of unauthorized live bootleg recordings. He is reported to have visited record stores in London that were selling Led Zeppelin bootlegs and demanded all copies be handed over. He also monitored the crowd at Led Zeppelin concerts in order to locate anything which resembled bootleg recording equipment. At one concert at Vancouver in 1971, he saw what he thought was such equipment on the floor of the venue and ensured that it was destroyed, only to later learn that it was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert. On another occasion, at the Bath Festival in 1970, he threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment.

Grant had complete and unwavering faith in Led Zeppelin. Unlike some other managers of the era, he never compromised his clients by exploiting them for short-term profit, instead always putting their interests first, and being a manager that split the profits five ways, between Grant and the other members of the band. This was demonstrated by his decision to never release the popular songs from Led Zeppelin&#x27;s albums as singles in the UK, out of respect for the band&#x27;s desire to develop the concept of album-oriented rock. As was explained by Jones:

Grant&#x27;s past experience in handling stars such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Gene Vincent also provided him with an excellent grounding in managing the pandemonium which frequently surrounded Led Zeppelin, particularly whilst the band was on tour. Grant himself said that &quot;Led Zeppelin looks after the music and I do everything else – and if it takes some strong measures to get our way, then so be it.&quot; According to rock journalist Steven Rosen:

Although there were media reports of his heavy-handed, intimidating tactics, Grant was respected in the business. Jones said, &quot;Peter was a very sensitive man. He was a very, very smart man. People just think of his size and his reputation, but actually he never had to use his size. He could out-talk anybody ...&quot;

Grant was instrumental in setting up Led Zeppelin&#x27;s publishing company, Superhype Music in 1968. He was also the driving force in establishing Swan Song Records in 1974, which gave Led Zeppelin further financial and artistic control over its products. Although initially he solely managed Led Zeppelin, in later years he additionally assumed management of other bands signed to Swan Song, such as Stone the Crows, Bad Company and Maggie Bell. In 1975, he turned down a lucrative offer to manage Queen. When he was once questioned on what was the single most important thing a manager could say, Grant&#x27;s response was &quot;Know when to say &#x27;no&#x27;.&quot; In 1977, he was asked by Colonel Tom Parker to manage a proposed concert tour of Europe by Elvis Presley, but Elvis died on 16 August 1977, just as negotiations had commenced.

=== Mr Zeppelin Regrets ===
In January 1972, Bernard Chevry, manager of the Midem music business festival wrote to Grant, asking for &quot;Led Zeppelin and his backing group&quot; to appear. Grant was annoyed that Chevry did not realise Led Zeppelin was a group, and in response took out a full-page advertisement in the trade paper &quot;Record Retailer&quot;, showing the original Midem letter, captioned &quot;Mr Zeppelin Regrets. ... .&quot; The response was seen by most of the music industry, and humiliated Chevry. Grant later described Chevry as &quot;a prat&quot;.

=== Oakland incident ===
In 1977, Grant gave his approval for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s tour manager Richard Cole to hire John Bindon to act as security co-ordinator for the band&#x27;s concert tour of the United States. Bindon had previously provided security for actors Ryan and Tatum O&#x27;Neal.

Towards the end of the tour, a major incident occurred during their first concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977. Upon arrival at the stadium, it was alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham&#x27;s stage crew out of the way as the band entered the stadium via a backstage ramp. Tension had been simmering between Graham&#x27;s staff and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near the end of the concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey unconscious.

Within minutes, Graham&#x27;s security man Jim Matzorkis reprimanded Grant&#x27;s 11-year-old son Warren over the removal of a dressing room sign, after which Matzorkis was cornered in a trailer and brutally beaten by Grant and Bindon, needing to be hospitalized afterwards. The band, except John Bonham, were performing on stage and were unaware of what was transpiring backstage. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s second Oakland show took place only after Bill Graham signed a letter of indemnification absolving Led Zeppelin from responsibility for the previous night&#x27;s incident. However, Graham refused to honour the letter because, according to his legal advice, he was under no obligation to agree to its terms.

Members of the band returned to their hotel after the concert, and were woken the next morning by a surprise police raid after Graham had changed his mind and decided to press charges. Bindon, Cole, Grant and Bonham received bail and travelled to New Orleans on 26 July, but the remaining dates on the tour were subsequently cancelled due to the sudden death of Robert Plant&#x27;s son, Karac, back home in the UK. As they returned to Britain, a suit was filed against them by Graham for $2 million.

After months of legal wrangling, Led Zeppelin offered to settle and all four pleaded &quot;nolo contendere&quot;, receiving suspended sentences and undisclosed fines. Bindon had already been dismissed by the band upon their return to Britain. Grant later stated that allowing Bindon to be hired was the biggest mistake he made as manager.

== Final years ==

Marital problems, diabetes, cocaine addiction and the death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham all took their toll on Grant&#x27;s health, and after the official breakup of Led Zeppelin in 1980, and the subsequent folding of the Swan Song label in 1983, he virtually retired from the music business to his private estate in Hellingly, East Sussex.

However, towards the end of his life he conquered his addiction and lost a significant amount of weight. His first public appearance for many years was in 1989, when he and Jimmy Page both attended a Frank Sinatra concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Grant subsequently sold his estate and moved to nearby Eastbourne, where he was offered the civic position of local magistrate for the town council, but he turned it down. In 1992, he appeared in the film &quot;Carry On Columbus&quot; as a cardinal. In his remaining years, Grant became a keynote speaker at music management conferences such as In the City, where he was lauded by latter-day peers.

== Death ==
On the afternoon of 21 November 1995, Grant suffered a fatal heart attack while driving to his home at Eastbourne with his son Warren. He was 60 years old.

Grant was buried on 4 December 1995 at the cemetery opposite his mansion, with the funeral service held at St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Hailsham, East Sussex. His eulogy was read by longtime friend Alan Callan. Coincidentally, it was the 15th anniversary of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s official breakup. His final public appearance had been at the final night of the Page and Plant tour at the Wembley Arena in July 1995.

Grant was survived by his son and daughter.

== Tributes and accolades ==
Grant has been widely recognised for improving pay and conditions for musicians in dealings with concert promoters. According to music journalist Mat Snow, &quot;Peter Grant enjoys a proud position in the pantheon of legendary British rock managers.&quot; He has also been stated as &quot;the most colourful and influential manager in the history of rock.&quot; Phil Everly, from the Everly Brothers, noted: &quot;Without his efforts, musicians had no careers. He was the first to make sure the artists came first and that we got paid and paid properly.&quot;

Chris Dreja, whom Grant had managed whilst he was with the Yardbirds, recalls:

Similarly, Page has described Grant as groundbreaking in his style of management, explaining that &quot;Peter had changed the dynamic that existed between bands, managers and promoters. He was a superb, canny manager.&quot;

In 1996, the MMF (Music Managers Forum) award for outstanding achievement in management was renamed the Peter Grant Award, in his honour.

<doc id="584168" wikidata="Q2903161" url="?curid=584168" title="Res gestae">
<text>Res gestae (Latin: &quot;things done&quot;) is a term found in substantive and procedural American jurisprudence and English law. In American substantive law, it refers to the period of a felony from start-to-end. In American procedural law, it refers to a former exception to the hearsay rule for statements made spontaneously or as part of an act. The English and Canadian version of &quot;res gestae&quot; is similar, but is still recognized as a traditional exception to the hearsay rule.

==&quot;Res gestae&quot; in American substantive law==
In certain felony murder statutes, &quot;res gestae&quot; is a term defining the overall start-to-end sequence of the underlying felony. Generally, a felony&#x27;s &quot;res gestae&quot; is considered terminated when the suspect has achieved a position of relative safety from law enforcement.

==&quot;Res gestae&quot; in American hearsay law==

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, &quot;res gestae&quot; may formerly have been, but is no longer, an exception to the rule against hearsay evidence based on the belief that, because certain statements are made naturally, spontaneously, and without deliberation during the course of an event, they leave little room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation upon hearing by someone else (e.g., by the witness, who will later repeat the statement to the court), and thus the courts believe that such statements carry a high degree of credibility. Statements that could be admitted into evidence as &quot;res gestae&quot; fall into three headings:

# Words or phrases that either form part of, or explain, a physical act;
# Exclamations that are so spontaneous as to belie concoction; and
# Statements that are evidence of someone&#x27;s state of mind.

The present sense impression, excited utterance, and then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition hearsay exceptions, respective to the above headings, now cover many situations under the Federal Rules of Evidence that would formerly have been considered &quot;res gestae&quot;.

In some jurisdictions, the &quot;res gestae&quot; exception has also been used to admit police sketches.

The following scenario is an example of types 1 and 2: Imagine a young woman (the witness) standing on the side of a main road. She sees some commotion across the street. On the opposite side of the road to her, she sees an old man and hears him shout, &quot;The bank is being robbed!&quot;, as a young man runs out of a building and away down the street. The old man is never found (and so cannot appear in court to repeat what he said), but the woman repeats what she heard him say. Such a statement would be considered trustworthy for the purpose of admission as evidence because the statement was made concurrently with the event, and there is little chance that the witness repeating the hearsay could have misunderstood its meaning or the speaker&#x27;s intentions.

== &quot;Res gestae&quot; in American propensity evidence law ==
Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, &quot;res gestae&quot; may also be used to demonstrate that certain character evidence, otherwise excludable under the provisions of Rule 404, is permissible, as the events in question are part of the &quot;ongoing narrative&quot;, or sequence of events that are necessary to define the action at hand.

== &quot;Res gestae&quot; in English hearsay law ==

The common law &quot;res gestae&quot; exception has been preserved under the statutory hearsay regime in s118(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

Categories (a) and (c) are the most commonly used. The American formulation of &quot;excited utterances&quot; is broadly akin to the English category of &quot;emotionally overpowering&quot;.

When considering whether to admit hearsay evidence through the &quot;res gestae&quot;, case law strongly advises judges to consider whether &quot;the possibility of concoction or distortion [can] be disregarded&quot;.

There has been significant criticism of the exception by judges and legal academics. In 1997, the Law Commission argued that the primary use of it was to allow evidence from unavailable witnesses (including those who were deceased or in fear of testifying)—their proposal for a hearsay exception for this specific reason became section 116 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Given the existence of this, &quot;it is difficult to see what useful purpose was served by retaining this group of exceptions to the hearsay rule, because they add little if anything to what is already provided by section 116&quot; argues Professor JR Spencer.

==Other uses==

* &quot;Res gestae&quot; is also used to refer to those facts or things done which form the basis or &quot;gravamen&quot; for a legal action.
* &quot;Res gestae&quot; is also used in the context of the doctrine of &quot;respondeat superior&quot;, or the law of vicarious liability. Particularly, &quot;res gestae&quot; refers to time, place, and in the interest of an employer.
* &quot;Res Gestae&quot; is a publication of the Indiana State Bar Association.
* &quot;Res Gestae&quot; is R.G. Collingwood&#x27;s term for the world of human affairs (as separated from the natural world) in his &quot;The Idea Of History&quot; (1946), which deals with the philosophy of history.

<doc id="584169" wikidata="Q14814273" url="?curid=584169" title="Kyöpelinvuori">
<text>Kyöpelinvuori (, from &quot;kyöpeli&quot; = obsolete word for ghost and &quot;vuori&quot; = mountain), in Finnish mythology, is the place which dead women haunt. It is rumoured that virgins who die young gather there after their death at the start of their afterlife. Similar stories of paradise mountains for pious virgins have also been known in Catholic Central Europe and Russia. It corresponds to Blockula (in modern Swedish &quot;Blåkulla&quot;) of Swedish mythology.

Kyöpelinvuori has been associated with witch-apathetic beliefs, but the name is not yet mentioned in documents dating back to the 17th-century witch hunts. In Swedish witch accounts, as mentioned before, the Sabbath was Blåkulla, which was sometimes spoken of in Finland as well, but more often only in general, a mountain or some other mythical place.

Kyöpelinvuori is also well known in Finland due to Easter: it is said to be the ancient home of mountain witches who fly on brooms with black cats. The witches leave the area only during Easter in order to spook children. These witches have also been humorously referred to be spinsters who will end up there in order to escape from the &quot;old maid&quot; tax..

According to the National Land Survey of Finland, there is a total number of 32 Kyöpelinvuori hills in Finland.

<doc id="584171" wikidata="Q462948" url="?curid=584171" title="Old Sparky">
<text>Old Sparky is the nickname of the electric chairs in Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. Old Smokey is the nickname of the electric chairs used in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. &quot;Old Sparky&quot; is sometimes used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not one of a specific state.

==Connecticut==
Connecticut legislated lethal injection as its sole method of execution in 1995. The last person executed by electrocution was Joseph &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Taborsky in May 1960. Connecticut&#x27;s &quot;Old Sparky&quot; has not been tested since it was moved from Wethersfield to the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers in 1962, and prison officials claim the prison&#x27;s electrical system cannot handle it.

==Florida==
The electric chair was the sole means of execution in Florida from 1924 until 2000, when the Florida State Legislature, under pressure from the U.S. Supreme Court, signed lethal injection into law. Although no one has been executed in this manner since 1999, prisoners awaiting execution on Florida&#x27;s death row may still be electrocuted at their request. It is currently located in Florida State Prison on the outskirts of Starke. It was known for frequent malfunctions in the 1990s, namely in the cases of Jesse Tafero (executed May 4, 1990), Pedro Medina (executed March 25, 1997) and Allen Lee Davis (executed July 8, 1999). Reportedly, 6-inch flames shot out of Tafero&#x27;s head and 12-inch flames shot out of Medina&#x27;s head, raising the question whether use of the electric chair was &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;. After the Medina execution, which was reportedly painless in spite of the flames, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth commented, &quot;People who wish to commit murder, they&#x27;d better not do it in the state of Florida because we may have a problem with the electric chair.&quot;

Investigators have been unable to identify the cause of the problems. The wooden chair had been replaced in early 1999 to accommodate Davis&#x27;s girth. The electrical components remained the same for the system.

To ensure proper contact between the inmate&#x27;s head and the electrode, a saline-soaked sponge stuffed between the two was necessary. In the Tafero incident, a natural sponge was replaced with a synthetic sponge that caught fire during the execution. In the Medina incident, prison officials apparently did not properly soak the sponge in saline and it caught fire as well. Photographs provided after Davis&#x27;s execution showed that Davis suffered a bloody nose during the execution.

===Davis execution===

The 1999 execution of Allen Lee Davis incited outrage after witnesses saw his white shirt rapidly turn red with blood during his execution. Prison officials later determined the blood came from a profuse nosebleed most likely caused by an improperly fitted head strap. The source of the blood was not evident to witnesses during execution, because Davis&#x27;s head was covered with a traditional hood. A prison inspector general took photographs of Davis&#x27;s bloody body, still strapped in the chair, shortly after execution. These photographs later became key evidence in several cases mounting yet another challenge to the constitutionality of the electric chair. These lawsuits ultimately came to the Florida Supreme Court in the fall of 1999, when a majority (4 of the 7 Justices) found that the electric chair was constitutional in a case brought by death row inmate Thomas Provenzano. One of the dissenting Justices, Leander J. Shaw, Jr., took the extraordinary step of attaching to his opinion three color photographs of Davis&#x27;s bloody body strapped in the chair. This publication marked the first time those photographs had surfaced on the Internet or, for that matter, anywhere outside court and prison files.

The execution contributed to the debate over Florida&#x27;s adherence to electrocution and to the international debate over capital punishment in general. The Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s web servers repeatedly crashed under the demand for access to the photographs, reputed to be the first actual photographs of an American state execution in decades. The images were used during a protest demonstration in Madrid in support of a Spaniard on Florida&#x27;s death row. Some death penalty supporters in the United States viewed the photographs as a deterrent, apparently believing they had been posted on the website as a warning to all potentially dangerous criminals.

====Political response====
Some Florida politicians vowed never to eliminate the electric chair despite the debate, but events rapidly changed after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal from the Florida Supreme Court&#x27;s split decision upholding electrocution. The nation&#x27;s high court had declined to review appeals after the prior three malfunctions, so observers concluded that the nation&#x27;s high court now had come to view Florida&#x27;s death penalty problems more dimly. Partly on the advice of Attorney General Butterworth, Florida&#x27;s Governor Jeb Bush summoned the legislature into special session and in early 2000 it quickly approved lethal injection as the means of execution that must be used unless the inmate requests electrocution. The Attorney General then notified the Federal court and it agreed to dismiss the case based on the change in law.

==Georgia==
Georgia&#x27;s electric chair, known as &quot;Old Sparky&quot;, located at Georgia State Prison was installed in 1924 following the state&#x27;s abolition of hanging and was the sole method of execution in Georgia until October 25, 2001. The original chair, which was painted white, was replaced in 1980 and sent from the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center back to Reidsville, while a squat, varnished replacement was constructed to replace it. Between 1924 and 1998, Georgia electrocuted 441 prisoners. Today the original chair is on public display at Georgia State Prison, while its replacement is situated in a closet near the death chamber at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center. It was used in the 1945 execution of Lena Baker. In 1996, Georgia State Representative Doug Teper unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to replace the state&#x27;s electric chair with a guillotine in order to facilitate the use of the condemned prisoners&#x27; remains in organ donation.

==Kentucky==

Kentucky&#x27;s electric chair, known as &quot;Old Sparky&quot;, is located at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, Kentucky. It was first used on July 8, 1911; the first inmate to die in the chair was James Buckner, convicted of killing a police officer several weeks earlier. On July 13, 1928, Kentucky set a record by electrocuting eight men in its chair, each immediately after the other, more than any other state has electrocuted in a single day. The state has decommissioned the electric chair except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to March 31, 1998, and choose death by electrocution rather than death by lethal injection or if lethal injection is declared unconstitutional by a court. Prior to this legislated date, 163 deaths had occurred in Kentucky&#x27;s electric chair. The last such execution by electric chair occurred on July 1, 1997, when convicted murderer Harold McQueen, Jr. was executed in it.

==New York==
In 1887, New York State established a committee to determine a new, more humane system of execution to replace hanging. Alfred P. Southwick, a member of the committee, developed the idea of putting electric current through a device after hearing about how relatively painlessly and quickly a drunken man died after touching exposed power lines. As Southwick was a dentist accustomed to performing procedures on sitting subjects, his electrical device appeared in the form of a chair.

On June 4, 1888, Governor David B. Hill authorized the introduction of the electric chair. It was first used two years later when William Kemmler became the first person in the world to be executed by electricity at Auburn Prison, Auburn, New York on August 6, 1890.

&quot;Old Sparky&quot; was first used at Sing Sing prison for a mass execution on July 7, 1891. The order of execution, which would start at 4:30 a.m., was listed as James J. Slocum, Harris Smiler, Shibuya Jugiro, and Joseph Wood.

From 1914, all executions in New York state were conducted at Sing Sing prison using &quot;Old Sparky&quot;. After a series of escapes from death row, the &quot;Death House&quot; at Sing Sing was built in 1920 and began executions in 1922. It was a prison within the Sing Sing prison. The Death House block, which had its own hospital, kitchen, visiting room, and exercise yard, had 24 single cells plus an additional three cells for condemned women. A chamber where a prisoner spent their last day was nicknamed the &quot;Dance Hall&quot;. A corridor, known as the &quot;Last Mile&quot;, connected the ante-room to the execution chamber in which the electric chair was situated.

Executions at Sing Sing were traditionally carried out at 11 p.m. on Thursdays. Condemned prisoners would be brought into the execution room escorted by seven guards and the prison chaplain. Already waiting in the room would be the warden of Sing Sing, the state electrician, two doctors and twelve state-appointed witnesses. After the condemned prisoner was strapped into the chair and the electrodes attached, the warden would step forward and read out the final decision on the sentence. The prisoner would be asked for any last words or for a benediction. With a signal, the execution would then begin. Witnesses would leave once both doctors had confirmed that death had occurred.

In 75 years of operation, 695 people were executed in electric chairs in New York state correctional facilities (614 at Sing Sing, including the Rosenbergs&#x27; 1953 execution for espionage). The last person to be executed in New York state was Eddie Lee Mays who was electrocuted at Sing Sing on August 15, 1963. Two years later the State of New York abolished capital punishment. In 1995 the state reinstated execution by lethal injection. However, no death row inmate was executed before capital punishment was abolished again in 2004, after the New York Court of Appeals ruled in &quot;People v. LaValle&quot; that executions violated the state&#x27;s constitution.

==Ohio==
Ohio was the second state to adopt the electric chair as a means of execution, executing 315 people between 1897 and its last use was in 1963. The state stopped using the electric chair in 2001, and now exclusively utilizes lethal injection in executions. Ohio&#x27;s Old Sparky is now a museum exhibit in the Ohio State Reformatory.

==South Carolina==
The state installed the &quot;Old Sparky&quot; in 1912 at the Central Correctional Institution (CCI) in Columbia. In 1944 it was used to execute 14-year-old George Stinney, the youngest person to be sentenced to death in the United States for more than a century.In 1990, the chair was relocated to the newly built Broad River Correctional Institution and was used to execute Donald Henry Gaskins, the first white defendant to be executed for the murder of a Black person in South Carolina history. Today, It is still managed by the South Carolina Department of Corrections, and is the oldest electric chair still online in the world. 

In 1997, all death row inmates were relocated from Broad River to the Lieber Correctional Institution. The move provided better management controls and ensured correctional staff who dealt with condemned prisoners on a daily basis were not the same officers given the responsibility of carrying out capital punishment.

The most recent use of &quot;Old Sparky&quot; was on June 21, 2008 when convicted murderer James Earl Reed opted for this method of execution.

Under Act 43 of 2021, the electric chair is now the primary method of execution, although a firing squad is optional.

==Texas==

The Texas electric chair to which the name &quot;Old Sparky&quot; is applied was in use from 1924 to 1964. During that time, it saw the deaths of 361 prisoners sentenced to die by judicial electrocution. It was built by incarcerated craftsmen in 1924. Following its decommissioning, it was originally relegated to a prison dump before being rescued. Today, it is on public display as part of a replica death chamber at the Texas Prison Museum in Huntsville, Texas, along with tubing and straps used in Texas&#x27;s first execution by lethal injection.

In 1971, the Greater Dallas Crime Commission, a business organization, circulated a petition to recommission Texas&#x27;s &quot;Old Sparky&quot;. The petition received 10,620 endorsements.

==West Virginia==
The now-decommissioned electric chair known as &quot;Old Sparky&quot; at the now-closed West Virginia Penitentiary in Moundsville, West Virginia was installed in a facility originally used for hanging. It was in use from 1951 until 1959, during which time nine condemned prisoners were executed in the chair. The chair was bolted to a low platform which covered what had previously been the trapdoor of the gallows used in the state&#x27;s judicial hangings. Its control apparatus was designed in such a way that three push-button switches were to be simultaneously pressed by three members of the execution team; only one of these switches actually completed the circuit, allowing each member of the execution team to reassure himself that perhaps he had not been the one who had actually initiated the death of the condemned.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Green Mile&quot; by Stephen King and its film adaptation use &quot;Old Sparky&quot; as the official method of execution. 
* In an episode of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, Dale Gribble, excited about being on the executioner list as a new employee of a local prison, asks the prison warden where &quot;Old Sparky&quot; is. The warden explains that &quot;Old Sparky&quot; is no longer, replaced by lethal injection. Dale then asks where &quot;Old Squirty&quot; is, a variation on the original title.
* In the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot; and in the related novels, serial killer Dexter Morgan frequently cites &quot;Old Sparky&quot; as the consequence of his being caught.
* In the horror suspense film &quot;Constantine&quot; (2005), Club owner and neutral angel Papa Midnite and John Constantine make use of the &quot;Old Sparky&quot; chair from Sing Sing prison to help John locate the Spear of Destiny.
* &quot;Old Sparky&quot; also appeared in the film, &quot;Ted Bundy&quot; (2002) directed by Matthew Bright which dramatizes the serial killings of Ted Bundy portrayed by Michael Reilly Burke. His execution is also depicted in the film, but it is carried out inaccurately.
* &quot;The Reckoning&quot; by John Grisham mentions &quot;Old Sparky&quot; as the first portable electric chair in history used by Mississippi State Penitentiary.
* The Netflix series &quot;Ratched&quot; features an electric chair at the beginning of episode eight, named &quot;Big Sparky&quot; instead of &quot;Old Sparky&quot;. However, it is notable that California, the state in which the series is set, has never used the electric chair, though the chair&#x27;s nickname is reminiscent of the nickname for California&#x27;s gas chamber, &quot;The Big Sleep.&quot;

<text>Peter Raymond Grant (born October 26, 1936) and Barbara Rosemary Grant (born October 8, 1936) are a British married couple who are evolutionary biologists at Princeton University. Each currently holds the position of emeritus professor. They are known for their work with Darwin&#x27;s finches on Daphne Major, one of the Galápagos Islands. Since 1973, the Grants have spent six months of every year capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches on the island. They have worked to show that natural selection can be seen within a single lifetime, or even within a couple of years. Charles Darwin originally thought that natural selection was a long, drawn out process but the Grants have shown that these changes in populations can happen very quickly.

In 1994, they were awarded the Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The Grants were the subject of the book &quot;The Beak of the Finch: A Story of Evolution in Our Time&quot; by Jonathan Weiner, which won the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1995.

In 2003, the Grants were joint recipients of the Loye and Alden Miller Research Award. They won the 2005 Balzan Prize for Population Biology. The Balzan Prize citation states:
:Peter and Rosemary Grant are distinguished for their remarkable long-term studies demonstrating evolution in action in Galápagos finches. They have demonstrated how very rapid changes in body and beak size in response to changes in the food supply are driven by natural selection. They have also elucidated the mechanisms by which new species arise and how genetic diversity is maintained in natural populations. The work of the Grants has had a seminal influence in the fields of population biology, evolution, and ecology.

The Grants are both Fellows of the Royal Society, Peter in 1987, and Rosemary in 2007. In 2008, the Grants were among the thirteen recipients of the Darwin-Wallace Medal, which is bestowed every fifty years by the Linnean Society of London. In 2009, they were recipients of the annual Kyoto Prize in basic sciences, an international award honouring significant contributions to the scientific, cultural and spiritual betterment of mankind. In 2017, they received the Royal Medal in Biology &quot;for their research on the ecology and evolution of Darwin’s finches on the Galapagos, demonstrating that natural selection occurs frequently and that evolution is rapid as a result&quot;.

==Early years==
Barbara Rosemary Grant was born in Arnside, England in 1936. In her youth, she collected plant fossils and compared them to living look-alikes. At the age of 12, she read Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. Despite being told by her headmistress that pursuing an education in a male-dominated field of study would be foolish, in addition to contracting a serious case of mumps that temporarily stalled her academic activity, she decided to continue forth with her education. In 1960, she graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in Zoology. For the next year, she studied genetics under Conrad Waddington and later devised a dissertation to study isolated populations of fish. This project was put on hold when she accepted a biology teaching job at the University of British Columbia, where she met Peter Grant.

Peter Raymond Grant was born in 1936 in London, but relocated to the English countryside to avoid encroaching bombings during World War II. He attended school at the Surrey-Hampshire border, where he collected botanical samples, as well as insects. He attended the University of Cambridge and later moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and began work on a doctoral degree in Zoology at the University of British Columbia. Peter met Rosemary after beginning his research there, and after a year, the two wedded.

==Research==

For his doctoral degree, Peter Grant studied the relationship between ecology and evolution and how they were interrelated. The Grants travelled to the Tres Marias Islands off Mexico to conduct field studies of the birds that inhabited the island. They compared the differences of bill length to body size between populations living on the Islands and the nearby mainland. Of the birds studied, eleven species were not significantly different between the mainland and the islands; four species were significantly less variable on the islands, and one species was significantly more variable. On average, the birds on the islands had larger beaks. The Grants attributed these differences to what foods were available, and what was available was dependent on competitors. The bigger beaks indicated a greater range of foods present in the environment.

In 1965, Peter Grant accepted tenure at McGill University in Montreal. He created a method to test the Competition Hypothesis to see if it worked today as it did in the past. This research was done on grassland voles and woodland mice. The study looked at the competitiveness between populations of rodents and among rodent species. In his article &quot;Interspecific Competition Among Rodents&quot;, he concluded that competitive interaction for space is common among many rodent species, not just the species that have been studied in detail. Grant also states that there are many causes for increased competition: reproduction, resources, amount of space, and invasion of other species.

Daphne Major, in the Galápagos Islands, was a perfect place to perform experiments and study changes within birds. It was isolated and uninhabited; any changes that were to occur to the land and environment would be due to natural forces with no human destruction. The island provided the best environment to study natural selection; seasons of heavy rain switched to seasons of extended drought. With these environmental changes brought changes in the types of foods available to the birds. The Grants would study this for the next few decades of their lives.

In 1973, the Grants headed out on what they thought would be a two-year study on the island of Daphne Major. There they would study evolution and ultimately determine what drives the formation of new species. There are thirteen species of finch that live on the islands; five of these are tree finch, one warbler finch, one vegetarian finch, and six species of ground finch. These birds provide a great way to study adaptive radiation. Their beaks are specific to the type of diet they eat, which in turn is reflective of the food available. The finches are easy to catch and provide a good animal to study. The Grants tagged, labelled, measured, and took blood samples of the birds they were studying. The two-year study continued through 2012.

During the rainy season of 1977 only 24 millimetres of rain fell. Two of the main finch species were hit exceptionally hard and many of them died. The lack of rain caused major food sources to become scarce, causing the need to find alternative food sources. The smaller, softer seeds ran out, leaving only the larger, tougher seeds. The finch species with smaller beaks struggled to find alternate seeds to eat. The following two years suggested that natural selection could happen very rapidly. Because the smaller finch species could not eat the large seeds, they died off. Finches with larger beaks were able to eat the seeds and reproduce. The population in the years following the drought in 1977 had &quot;measurably larger&quot; beaks than had the previous birds.

In 1981, the Grants came across a bird they had never seen before. It was heavier than the other ground finches by more than five grams.
 They called this bird Big Bird. It had many different characteristics than those of the native finches: a strange call, extra glossy feathers, it could eat both large and small seeds, and could also eat the nectar, pollen, and seeds of the cacti that grow on the island. Although hybrids do happen, many of the birds living on the island tend to stick within their own species. Big Bird lived for thirteen years, initially interbreeding with local species. His descendants have only mated within themselves for the past thirty years, a total of seven generations.

Big Bird was originally assumed to be an immigrant from the island of Santa Cruz. However, in 2015, whole genome analysis linked its descent to a bird that originated on Española Island, more than 100 kilometers from Daphne Major, the Española cactus finch (&quot;G. conirostris&quot;). 
Descendants of &quot;G. conirostris&quot; and local finches (&quot;G. fortis&quot;) have become a distinct species, the first example of speciation to be directly observed by scientists in the field.
Whole genome studies have enabled scientists to trace changes in the genome as the species became distinct. Genes for beak shape (ALX1) and beak size (HMGA2) have been determined to be crucial in separating the hybridized species from local finches. Genes relating to the finches&#x27; song may also be involved.

Over the course of 1982–1983, El Niño brought a steady eight months of rain. In a normal rainy season Daphne Major usually gets two months of rain. The excessive rain brought a turnover in the types of vegetation growing on the island. The seeds shifted from large, hard to crack seeds to many different types of small, softer seeds. This gave birds with smaller beaks an advantage when another drought hit the following year. Small-beaked finch could eat all of the small seeds faster than the larger beaked birds could get to them.

In 2003, a drought similar in severity to the 1977 drought occurred on the island. However, in the time between the droughts (beginning in late 1982), the large ground finch (&quot;Geospiza magnirostris&quot;) had established a breeding population on the island. This species has diet overlap with the medium ground finch (&quot;G. fortis&quot;), so they are potential competitors. The 2003 drought and resulting decrease in food supply may have increased these species&#x27; competition with each other, particularly for the larger seeds in the medium ground finches&#x27; diet. Following the drought, the medium ground finch population had a decline in average beak size, in contrast to the increase in size found following the 1977 drought. This was hypothesized to be due to the presence of the large ground finch; the smaller-beaked individuals of the medium ground finch may have been able to survive better due to a lack of competition over large seeds with the large ground finch. This is an example of character displacement.

==Significant findings==
In &quot;Evolution: Making Sense of Life&quot;, the takeaway from the Grants&#x27; 40-year study can be broken down into three major lessons. The first is that natural selection is a variable, constantly changing process. The fact that they studied the island in both times of excessive rain and drought provides a better picture of what happens to populations over time. The next lesson learned is that evolution can actually be a fairly rapid process. It does not take millions of years; these processes can be seen in as little as two years. Lastly, and as the author states, most importantly, selection can change over time. During some years, selection will favour those birds with larger beaks. Other years with substantial amounts of smaller seeds, selection will favour the birds with the smaller beaks.

In their 2003 paper, the Grants wrap up their decades-long study by stating that selection oscillates in a direction. For this reason, neither the medium ground finch nor the cactus finch has stayed morphologically the same over the course of the experiment. The average beak and body size are not the same today for either species as they were when the study first began. The Grants also state that these changes in morphology and phenotypes could not have been predicted at the beginning. They were able to witness the evolution of the finch species as a result of the inconsistent and harsh environment of Daphne Major directly.

<text>Garcia de Resende (14703 February 1536) was a Portuguese poet and editor. He served John II as a page and private secretary. After John&#x27;s death, he continued to enjoy the same favour with Manuel I, whom he accompanied to Castile in 1498, and from whom he obtained a knighthood in the Order of Christ.

In 1514, Resende went to Rome with Tristão da Cunha, as secretary and treasurer of the embassy sent by the king to offer tribute to Pope Leo X. In 1516 he was given the rank of a nobleman of the royal household, and became &quot;escrivão de fazenda&quot; to Prince John, afterwards King John III, from whom he received further pensions in 1525.

Resende built a chapel in the monastery of Espinheiro near Évora, the pantheon of the Alentejo nobility, where he was buried.

==Poetry==
He began to cultivate the making of verses in the palace of John II, and he reported that how one night when the king was in bed he caused him Resende to repeat some &quot;trovas&quot; (troubador songs) of Jorge Manrique, saying it was as needful for a man to know them as to know the &quot;Pater Noster&quot;. Under these conditions, Resende grew as a poet, and moreover distinguished himself by his skill in drawing and music; while he collected into an album the best court verse of the time. This was the &quot;Cancioneiro Geral&quot; (General Songbook), probably starting in 1483, though not printed until 1516, which includes the compositions of some three hundred &quot;fidalgos&quot; of the reigns of kings Afonso V, John II, and Manuel I.

The main subjects of its pieces are love, satire and epigram; and most of them are written in the national &quot;redondilha&quot; verse, but the metre is irregular and the rhyming careless. The Spanish language is largely employed, because the literary progenitors of the whole collection were Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, Boscán and Garcilaso. As a rule the compositions were improvised at palace entertainments, at which the poets present divided into two bands, attacking and defending a given theme throughout successive evenings. At other times these poetical soirées took the form of a mock trial at law, in which Eleanor, the queen of John II, acted as judge. Resende was mocked by other rhymesters about his corpulence, but he repaid all their gibes with interest.

<text>Giovanni Bononcini (or Buononcini) (18 July 1670 – 9 July 1747) (sometimes cited also as Giovanni Battista Bononcini) was an Italian Baroque composer, cellist, singer and teacher, one of a family of string players and composers. He was a rival to George Frederic Handel.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Bononcini was born in Modena, the oldest of three sons. His father, Giovanni Maria Bononcini, was a violinist and a composer, and his younger brother, Antonio Maria Bononcini, was also a composer. An orphan from the age of 8, Giovanni Battista studied in the music school of Giovanni Paolo Colonna at San Petronio Basilica in Bologna (perhaps in 1680 or 1681).

In 1685, at the age of 15, he published three collections of instrumental works (in two of which he gave his age as 13). On 30 May 1686, he was accepted as a member of the prestigious Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna. His services were already much in demand: he worked at San Petronio as a string player and singer, published further collections of instrumental pieces, and produced two oratorios for performance in Bologna and Modena. From 1687 to 1691 he served as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the church of San Giovanni in Monte in Bologna, for which he composed a set of masses for double choir which were published in 1688 as his Op. 7. In 1690 he composed a further oratorio for Modena. He also spent some time in Milan in 1689 and 1690. In 1691 he dedicated a set of vocal duets (Op. 8) to Emperor Leopold I and played in the orchestra of the Cardinal Legate of Bologna, Benedetto Pamphili.
===Rome===
In the same year, he moved to Rome, where he entered the service of Filippo II Colonna, a powerful patron of the arts, for whom Bononcini, along with Colonna&#x27;s librettist, Silvio Stampiglia, produced six serenatas, an oratorio and three (possibly five) operas between 1692 and 1696, including the highly successful &quot;Xerse&quot; (1694). Another successful opera, &quot;Il trionfo di Camilla&quot; was produced in Naples (in 1696 or 1697) following the appointment of Colonna&#x27;s brother-in-law, Luis de la Cerda, as Spain&#x27;s local viceroy. Between 1695 and 1696, Bononcini was made a member of two of Rome&#x27;s most exclusive artistic circles, the musical Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia and the literary Accademia degli Arcadi (in which he was one of seven musicians proposed as founding members of a &quot;chorus&quot; or performance arm). Around this time, the eclectic musician and poet Giuseppe Valentini wrote a sonnet in praise of Bononcini&#x27;s teaching abilities.

===Vienna and Berlin===
Following the death of Colonna&#x27;s wife Lorenza in August 1697, Bononcini left Rome for Vienna, where he entered the service of Emperor Leopold I with a large salary and also established himself as the favoured composer of Leopold&#x27;s heir and successor, Joseph. In 1702, following the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession, Bononcini moved to the court of Queen Sophia Charlotte in Berlin, where he became the queen&#x27;s favourite composer and broadened his public reputation with a production of a new opera, &quot;Polifemo&quot; (he also composed &quot;Cefalo&quot; there).

Although his activities in the next decade are less well documented, he appears to have been in Venice for the production of a new opera during the carnival of 1706. By this time Bononcini had an enviable international reputation: in the words of his fellow composer Francesco Geminiani, &quot;Camilla&quot; had &quot;astonished the musical world by its departure from the dry, flat melody to which their ears had until then been accustomed&quot;. By 1710, productions of &quot;Camilla&quot; (presumably based on Bononcini&#x27;s version) had reached London as well as many cities across Italy. At some time during this decade on one of his sojourns to Italy, he married Margherita Balletti. She came from a family of actors and &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; players and was the sister-in-law of Luigi Riccoboni.

===London===
From 1720 to 1732 he was in London, where for a time his popularity rivalled George Frideric Handel&#x27;s, who had arrived in London in 1712. The Tories favoured Handel, while the Whig party favoured Bononcini. Their competition inspired the epigram by John Byrom that made the phrase &quot;Tweedledum and Tweedledee&quot; famous. Handel steadily gained the ascendancy, and Bononcini became a pensioner of the Duchess of Marlborough, who had led his admirers. Bononcini left London after charges of plagiarism were proven against him: he had palmed off a madrigal by Antonio Lotti as his own work.

===Final years===
After leaving London in 1733, Bononcini travelled to France in the company of an adventurer, Count Ughi, who swindled him out of most of his property. In Paris, Bononcini gave concerts of his religious music at the Concert Spirituel and then moved on to Lisbon to become the cello teacher to the Portuguese king. In 1736 he returned to Vienna, where his opera &quot;Alessandro in Sidone&quot; and his oratorio &quot;Ezechia&quot; were performed in 1737. In dire financial straits by 1742, he petitioned Maria Theresa of Austria for help. In October of that year, she granted him a pension of 50 florins a month in recognition of his past service to the court. Bononcini died on 9 July 1747 in Vienna, impoverished and largely forgotten. After his death, his last major composition, a Te Deum which he had composed in 1741 for Francis I, was performed in celebration of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

==Compositions==

His earliest works for the cello are two &quot;Sinfonie&quot; included in a manuscript in the abbey of Montecassino. His other works include a number of operas, masses, and a funeral anthem for the Duke of Marlborough. One of his operas, &quot;Xerse&quot;, parodied material in an earlier setting of that opera by Francesco Cavalli, including the aria &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;. Bononcini&#x27;s &quot;Xerse&quot; was in turn adapted by Handel in his &quot;Serse&quot; with a third (and best known) version of &quot;Ombra mai fu&quot;. Bononcini&#x27;s song &quot;Vado ben spesso cangiando loco&quot; was used by Franz Liszt in his suite for piano &quot;Années de pèlerinage: Deuxième année: Italie&quot; under the erroneous title &quot;Canzonetta del Salvator Rosa&quot;.

<text>SS &quot;Gopher State&quot; (T-ACS-4) is a crane ship in ready reserve for the United States Navy. The ship was named for the state of Minnesota, which is also known as the &quot;Gopher State&quot;.

Currently at anchor in Weymouth Bay, England receiving bunkers.

== History ==
&quot;Gopher State&quot; was laid down on 26 July 1971, as the container ship Export Leader, ON 545126, IMO 7226689, a Maritime Administration type C5-S-73b hull under MARAD contract (MA 257). Built by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, hull no. 358, she was launched on 8 July 1972, and delivered to MARAD 22 January 1973, entering service for American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines (renamed American Export Lines in the same year). She was sold to Farrell Lines in 1978 without name change. The ship was returned to MARAD in 1986 and laid up in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF). In 1987 she was converted to a type C5-S-MA73c crane ship by Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock, Norfolk, Virginia. Completed on 12 October 1987, she was placed in service as &quot;Gopher State&quot; (T-ACS-4) and assigned to the Ready Reserve Force (RRF), under operation control of the Military Sealift Command (MSC).
&quot;Gopher State&quot; is in ready reserve, laid up at Newport News, Virginia. As of December 2016, she is in Drydock No. 3 in Boston.

<doc id="584196" wikidata="Q622886" url="?curid=584196" title="Natterjack toad">
<text>The natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita) is a toad native to sandy and heathland areas of Europe and the United Kingdom. Adults are in length, and are distinguished from common toads by a yellow line down the middle of the back and parallel paratoid glands. They have relatively short legs, which gives them a distinctive gait, contrasting with the hopping movement of many other toad species.

Natterjacks have a very loud and distinctive mating call amplified by the single vocal sac found under the chin of the male.

==Life history==


Natterjacks live for up to 15 years, and feed mainly on insects, especially beetles. At night, they move around open terrain with sparse vegetation, and their tracks can often be seen in loose sand. They move considerable distances each night, enabling the species to colonize new habitats very quickly.

===Reproduction===
The natterjack toad spawns between the end of April and July, laying strings of eggs in shallow, warm pools. Because the natterjack toad is often present in low numbers, its loud mating calls are important so that the sexes can find each other.

Natterjacks can only spawn in pools that have a very slightly sloping bottom, and tolerate only sparse vegetation on the banks and in the water. Since pools of this description are often temporary, sometimes the tadpoles die when the pools dry out. The natterjack compensates for that risk by mating over an extended period each summer. Thus, in September, the age of the juveniles can vary from one to three months. Early breeders seldom breed again later in the season, though some females do spawn twice in a year.

==Distribution==
Populations of the natterjack extend through 17 European countries. In the UK, the toad is now almost completely confined to coastal sites. The natterjack is the only species of toad native to Ireland. It is found in County Kerry (Dingle Peninsula and Derrynane) and also in County Wexford, where it was introduced to a dune site.

In mainland Europe, particularly in the southern part of its range, it lives inland in a variety of habitats.

==Conservation==

===UK===
In the UK, the threatened status of the species resulted in a national Biodiversity Action Plan designating it as one of three protected amphibians. Reasons for its threatened status include:
* Loss of habitat from human overpopulation
* Deterioration and loss of lowland heaths
* Reduction in habitable coast from construction of dykes and seawalls
* Acidification of aquatic habitat from acid rain and other pollution
In England, the toad&#x27;s sand dune habitat is protected by a number of national nature reserves. For example, in the north-west, reserves are at Hoylake, Ainsdale Sand Dunes, North Walney and Sandscale Haws. In Scotland, where the species is confined to the Solway Firth, a reserve is at Caerlaverock. In Wales, the species became extinct in the 20th century, but has been reintroduced as part of the Biodiversity Action Plan.

===Ireland===
To reverse habitat loss, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has created ponds for the species with some funding from the Heritage Council. The natterjack is considered endangered in Ireland. , a project involving Fota Wildlife Park and the National Parks and Wildlife Service has released 6,000 toadlets into their natural range in County Kerry.

The natterjack toad is used as a symbol for Dooks Golf club in Kerry.

It is a spin-off from &quot;Man About the House&quot;, and starred Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce as constantly-sparring married couple George and Mildred Roper. The premise of the series had George and Mildred leaving their flat as depicted in &quot;Man About the House&quot; and moving to a modern, upmarket housing estate in Hampton Wick. Their arrival horrifies their snobbish neighbour Jeffrey Fourmile, a middle-class estate agent who fears the Ropers&#x27; presence will devalue his home.

It was written by Brian Cooke and Johnnie Mortimer. Like many British sitcoms, &quot;George and Mildred&quot; was made into a film. The movie was dedicated to actress Yootha Joyce who died suddenly in August 1980, just as the cast were about to film a sixth and final series.

==Premise==
George and Mildred Roper have left their old house after receiving a compulsory purchase order from the council, and move to 46 Peacock Crescent in upmarket Hampton Wick. While Mildred enjoys the chance to better herself in her new surroundings, she is always being thwarted—usually by the lazy, inept and generally unemployed George, who has no interest in climbing the social ladder, and also continues to show a lack of interest in sexual relations with Mildred.

George and Mildred&#x27;s next-door neighbours are Jeffrey Fourmile, a snobbish estate agent and his wife Ann. Ann and Mildred become good friends, but Jeffrey is frequently irritated by George, with their spats providing much of the show&#x27;s humour. The Fourmiles have a young son, Tristram, who gets on well with George, much to the chagrin of Jeffrey (particularly because Jeffrey supports the Conservative Party, while George puts socialist ideas into Tristram&#x27;s head). In series three, Ann gives birth to a second child; Tarquin.

Mildred&#x27;s snobbish sister Ethel and her rich husband Humphrey occasionally visit, as does Mildred&#x27;s elderly mother. Having married wealth, Ethel enjoys trying to make Mildred feel inferior by showing off her latest car or fur coat, at which point Mildred often makes subtle digs at Ethel&#x27;s age, or social status and pretensions. George however, is far less subtle. George&#x27;s friend Jerry, a jack-of-all-trades and common swindler, also visits occasionally, much to Mildred&#x27;s annoyance. Jerry is fond of referring to Mildred as &quot;Mildew&quot;. Jerry is the only other character from &quot;Man About the House&quot; to reappear in this series.

In the first series, George buys Mildred a Yorkshire Terrier called Truffles after the Ropers are unable to adopt a child (Mildred later registers her with the kennel club as &quot;Truffles duBorbon Fitzwilliam III&quot;).

==Episodes==
==Props==
George Roper&#x27;s 1933 Brough motorcycle combination—shown to regular comic effect in the opening titles of series 2, 3 and 5—is now exhibited at the London Motorcycle Museum. It also appeared in the BBC sitcom &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. In episodes 1-6 of Series 1, George drives a Reliant Regal three-wheeler – which he swaps for a caravan in the episode &quot;Where My Caravan Has Rested&quot;. The Fourmiles&#x27; car was Ford Granada Mk1 in Series 1–4 changing to a Volvo 240 estate in Series 5.

==Filming locations==
The exterior shots for the Roper and Fourmile residences were filmed at 46 and 44 Manor Road, Teddington, Middlesex TW11 8AB. Interior scenes were filmed at the nearby Thames Television studios in Teddington.

==Theme music==
The theme music for the show used from series 2–5 is &quot;Graphic Brown&quot; by Roger Webb (Media Music Number 22, &quot;Multi Images&quot;, 1978).

==Stage show==
During 1977, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce, joined at one point by Reginald Marsh, toured in a successful stage version of the programme. The tour included appearances at The King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh. In 1976 and 1977, Murphy and Joyce appeared as the ugly sisters, Georgina and Mildred, in the London Palladium pantomime, &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

==Film version==

Following the fifth series, a feature film version of the series was produced in 1980. The film was not written by Cooke and Mortimer but by Dick Sharples. The Fourmiles only played a small role in the film, which focused on George and Mildred celebrating their wedding anniversary, at Mildred&#x27;s insistence, at an upmarket London hotel. It featured several guest stars including Stratford Johns, Kenneth Cope and Vicki Michelle. The film was neither a critical nor box office success. It was first shown on television on ITV on Christmas Day 1980.

==The end==
The final caption of the &quot;George and Mildred&quot; film read &quot;The End – or is it the beginning?&quot; It would prove to be the former as Yootha Joyce died from portal cirrhosis of the liver due to chronic alcoholism on 24 August 1980, before the film was released. Friends and colleagues were unaware that Joyce had been habitually consuming half a bottle of brandy every day for over 10 years.

In 2004, on an audio commentary on the Australian Umbrella DVD release of &quot;George and Mildred&quot;: the Complete Series 2, Brian Murphy revealed that there had been plans for a sixth series of eight episodes of the show. These were to have been recorded in late 1980. Murphy also revealed that this was due to have been the final series of &quot;George and Mildred&quot;, as he and Yootha Joyce were afraid of being typecast after playing the characters since 1973 on television and in two films. However, despite scripts being written, Joyce&#x27;s hospitalisation and subsequent death brought a premature end to the show. Her funeral took place on the day the cast were due to begin rehearsals for the new series. Speaking of their relationship in a 2001 ITV programme, &quot;The Unforgettable Yootha Joyce&quot;, Murphy said that when they had first met at Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop he had, &quot;always regarded Yootha as very stylish and very confident. I was rather over-awed by her at first, full of admiration for her. &quot;At her death, &quot;People said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve lost a working partner&#x27; and I said, &#x27;No, I&#x27;ve lost a chum&#x27;... and then I realised I&#x27;ve lost my working partnership &quot;as well&quot;...&quot;.

Thames Television did consider producing a spin-off for the character of George, looking at him cope with life as a widower. However, this project did not materialise, with Brian Murphy briefly moving to the BBC the following year for &quot;L for Lester&quot; which was cancelled after just one series.

He did reunite with &quot;George and Mildred&quot; co-star Roy Kinnear and writers Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke for &quot;The Incredible Mr. Tanner&quot;, a comedy produced by Thames Television.

==Adaptations==
&quot;George and Mildred&quot; was adapted in the United States as &quot;The Ropers&quot;, a spin-off from &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (itself the US adaptation of &quot;Man About the House&quot;).
