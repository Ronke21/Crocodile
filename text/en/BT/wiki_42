<text>Wireless power transfer (WPT; also wireless energy transmission or WET) is the transmission of electrical energy without wires as a physical link. In a wireless power transmission system, an electrically powered transmitter device generates a time-varying electromagnetic field that transmits power across space to a receiver device; the receiver device extracts power from the field and supplies it to an electrical load. The technology of wireless power transmission can eliminate the use of the wires and batteries, thereby increasing the mobility, convenience, and safety of an electronic device for all users. Wireless power transfer is useful to power electrical devices where interconnecting wires are inconvenient, hazardous, or are not possible.

Wireless power techniques mainly fall into two categories: Near and far field. In &quot;near field&quot; or &quot;non-radiative&quot; techniques, power is transferred over short distances by magnetic fields using inductive coupling between coils of wire, or by electric fields using capacitive coupling between metal electrodes. Inductive coupling is the most widely used wireless technology; its applications include charging handheld devices like phones and electric toothbrushes, RFID tags, induction cooking, and wirelessly charging or continuous wireless power transfer in implantable medical devices like artificial cardiac pacemakers, or electric vehicles. In &quot;far-field&quot; or &quot;radiative&quot; techniques, also called &quot;power beaming&quot;, power is transferred by beams of electromagnetic radiation, like microwaves or laser beams. These techniques can transport energy longer distances but must be aimed at the receiver. Proposed applications for this type include solar power satellites and wireless powered drone aircraft.

Wireless power transfer is a generic term for a number of different technologies for transmitting energy by means of electromagnetic fields. The technologies differ in the distance over which they can transfer power efficiently, whether the transmitter must be aimed (directed) at the receiver, and in the type of electromagnetic energy they use: time varying electric fields, magnetic fields, radio waves, microwaves, infrared or visible light waves.

In general a wireless power system consists of a &quot;transmitter&quot; device connected to a source of power such as a mains power line, which converts the power to a time-varying electromagnetic field, and one or more &quot;receiver&quot; devices which receive the power and convert it back to DC or AC electric current which is used by an electrical load. At the transmitter the input power is converted to an oscillating electromagnetic field by some type of &quot;antenna&quot; device. The word &quot;antenna&quot; is used loosely here; it may be a coil of wire which generates a magnetic field, a metal plate which generates an electric field, an antenna which radiates radio waves, or a laser which generates light. A similar antenna or coupling device at the receiver converts the oscillating fields to an electric current. An important parameter that determines the type of waves is the frequency, which determines the wavelength.

Wireless power uses the same fields and waves as wireless communication devices like radio, another familiar technology that involves electrical energy transmitted without wires by electromagnetic fields, used in cellphones, radio and television broadcasting, and WiFi. In radio communication the goal is the transmission of information, so the amount of power reaching the receiver is not so important, as long as it is sufficient that the information can be received intelligibly. In wireless communication technologies only tiny amounts of power reach the receiver. In contrast, with wireless power transfer the amount of energy received is the important thing, so the efficiency (fraction of transmitted energy that is received) is the more significant parameter. For this reason, wireless power technologies are likely to be more limited by distance than wireless communication technologies.

Wireless power transfer may be used to power up wireless information transmitters or receivers. This type of communication is known as wireless powered communication (WPC). When the harvested power is used to supply the power of wireless information transmitters, the network is known as Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT); whereas when it is used to supply the power of wireless information receivers, it is known as a Wireless Powered Communication Network (WPCN).

An important issue associated with all wireless power systems is limiting the exposure of people and other living beings to potentially injurious electromagnetic fields.

== History ==

=== 19th century developments and dead ends ===

The 19th century saw many developments of theories, and counter-theories on how electrical energy might be transmitted. In 1826, André-Marie Ampère discovered a connection between current and magnets. Michael Faraday described in 1831 with his law of induction the electromotive force driving a current in a conductor loop by a time-varying magnetic flux. Transmission of electrical energy without wires was observed by many inventors and experimenters, but lack of a coherent theory attributed these phenomena vaguely to electromagnetic induction. A concise explanation of these phenomena would come from the 1860s Maxwell&#x27;s equations by James Clerk Maxwell, establishing a theory that unified electricity and magnetism to electromagnetism, predicting the existence of electromagnetic waves as the &quot;wireless&quot; carrier of electromagnetic energy. Around 1884 John Henry Poynting defined the Poynting vector and gave Poynting&#x27;s theorem, which describe the flow of power across an area within electromagnetic radiation and allow for a correct analysis of wireless power transfer systems. This was followed on by Heinrich Rudolf Hertz&#x27; 1888 validation of the theory, which included the evidence for radio waves.

During the same period two schemes of wireless signaling were put forward by William Henry Ward (1871) and Mahlon Loomis (1872) that were based on the erroneous belief that there was an electrified atmospheric stratum accessible at low altitude. Both inventors&#x27; patents noted this layer connected with a return path using &quot;Earth currents&quot;&#x27; would allow for wireless telegraphy as well as supply power for the telegraph, doing away with artificial batteries, and could also be used for lighting, heat, and motive power. A more practical demonstration of wireless transmission via conduction came in Amos Dolbear&#x27;s 1879 magneto electric telephone that used ground conduction to transmit over a distance of a quarter of a mile.

=== Nikola Tesla ===
After 1890, inventor Nikola Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using spark-excited radio frequency resonant transformers, now called Tesla coils, which generated high AC voltages. Early on he attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He found he could increase the distance at which he could light a lamp by using a receiving LC circuit tuned to resonance with the transmitter&#x27;s LC circuit. using resonant inductive coupling. Tesla failed to make a commercial product out of his findings but his resonant inductive coupling method is now widely used in electronics and is currently being applied to short-range wireless power systems.

Tesla went on to develop a wireless power distribution system that he hoped would be capable of transmitting power long distance directly into homes and factories. Early on he seemed to borrow from the ideas of Mahlon Loomis, proposing a system composed of balloons to suspend transmitting and receiving electrodes in the air above in altitude, where he thought the pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances. To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air he set up a test facility at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. Experiments he conducted there with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, as well as observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes, led him to conclude incorrectly that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy. The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allow alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth with very little power loss. His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would &quot;break the air stratum down&quot;, eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit. Tesla would go on the next year to propose a &quot;World Wireless System&quot; that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide. In 1901, at Shoreham, New York he attempted to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called Wardenclyffe Tower, but by 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.

=== Post-war developments ===

Before World War II, little progress was made in wireless power transmission. Radio was developed for communication uses, but could not be used for power transmission since the relatively low-frequency radio waves spread out in all directions and little energy reached the receiver. In radio communication, at the receiver, an amplifier intensifies a weak signal using energy from another source. For power transmission, efficient transmission required transmitters that could generate higher-frequency microwaves, which can be focused in narrow beams towards a receiver.

The development of microwave technology during World War II, such as the klystron and magnetron tubes and parabolic antennas, made radiative (far-field) methods practical for the first time, and the first long-distance wireless power transmission was achieved in the 1960s by William C. Brown. In 1964, Brown invented the rectenna which could efficiently convert microwaves to DC power, and in 1964 demonstrated it with the first wireless-powered aircraft, a model helicopter powered by microwaves beamed from the ground.

== Field regions ==

Electric and magnetic fields are created by charged particles in matter such as electrons. A stationary charge creates an electrostatic field in the space around it. A steady current of charges (direct current, DC) creates a static magnetic field around it. These fields contain energy, but cannot carry power because they are static. However time-varying fields can carry power. Accelerating electric charges, such as are found in an alternating current (AC) of electrons in a wire, create time-varying electric and magnetic fields in the space around them. These fields can exert oscillating forces on the electrons in a receiving &quot;antenna&quot;, causing them to move back and forth. These represent alternating current which can be used to power a load.

The oscillating electric and magnetic fields surrounding moving electric charges in an antenna device can be divided into two regions, depending on distance &quot;D&quot;range from the antenna.
 The boundary between the regions is somewhat vaguely defined. The fields have different characteristics in these regions, and different technologies are used for transferring power:

* &quot;Near-field&quot; or &quot;nonradiative&quot; region: This means the area within about 1 wavelength (&quot;λ&quot;) of the antenna. In this region the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are separate and power can be transferred via electric fields by capacitive coupling (electrostatic induction) between metal electrodes, or via magnetic fields by inductive coupling (electromagnetic induction) between coils of wire. These fields are not &quot;radiative&quot;, meaning the energy stays within a short distance of the transmitter. If there is no receiving device or absorbing material within their limited range to &quot;couple&quot; to, no power leaves the transmitter. The range of these fields is short, and depends on the size and shape of the &quot;antenna&quot; devices, which are usually coils of wire. The fields, and thus the power transmitted, decrease exponentially with distance, so if the distance between the two &quot;antennas&quot; &quot;D&quot;range is much larger than the diameter of the &quot;antennas&quot; &quot;D&quot;ant very little power will be received. Therefore, these techniques cannot be used for long range power transmission. Resonance, such as resonant inductive coupling, can increase the coupling between the antennas greatly, allowing efficient transmission at somewhat greater distances, although the fields still decrease exponentially. Therefore the range of near-field devices is conventionally divided into two categories: 
** &quot;Short range&quot;: up to about one antenna diameter: &quot;D&quot;range ≤ &quot;D&quot;ant. This is the range over which ordinary nonresonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transfer practical amounts of power.
** &quot;Mid-range&quot;: up to 10 times the antenna diameter: &quot;D&quot;range ≤ 10 &quot;D&quot;ant. This is the range over which resonant capacitive or inductive coupling can transfer practical amounts of power.
* &quot;Far-field&quot; or &quot;radiative&quot; region: Beyond about 1 wavelength (&quot;λ&quot;) of the antenna, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other and propagate as an electromagnetic wave; examples are radio waves, microwaves, or light waves. This part of the energy is &quot;radiative&quot;, meaning it leaves the antenna whether or not there is a receiver to absorb it. The portion of energy which does not strike the receiving antenna is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna&#x27;s size &quot;D&quot;ant to the wavelength of the waves &quot;λ&quot;, which is determined by the frequency: &quot;λ&quot; = &quot;c/f&quot;. At low frequencies &quot;f&quot; where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, &quot;D&quot;ant « &quot;λ&quot;, very little power is radiated. Therefore near-field devices, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. Antennas about the same size as the wavelength &quot;D&quot;ant ≈ &quot;λ&quot; such as monopole or dipole antennas, radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions (omnidirectionally), so if the receiving antenna is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it. Therefore, these can be used for short range, inefficient power transmission but not for long range transmission. However, unlike fields, electromagnetic radiation can be focused by reflection or refraction into beams. By using a high-gain antenna or optical system which concentrates the radiation into a narrow beam aimed at the receiver, it can be used for long range power transmission. From the Rayleigh criterion, to produce the narrow beams necessary to focus a significant amount of the energy on a distant receiver, an antenna must be much larger than the wavelength of the waves used: &quot;D&quot;ant » &quot;λ&quot; = &quot;c/f&quot;. Practical &quot;beam power&quot; devices require wavelengths in the centimeter region or lower, corresponding to frequencies above 1 GHz, in the microwave range or above.

== Near-field (nonradiative) techniques ==

At large relative distance, the near-field components of electric and magnetic fields are approximately quasi-static oscillating dipole fields. These fields decrease with the cube of distance: (&quot;D&quot;range / &quot;D&quot;ant)−3 Since power is proportional to the square of the field strength, the power transferred decreases as (&quot;D&quot;range / &quot;D&quot;ant)−6. or 60 dB per decade. In other words, if far apart, increasing the distance between the two antennas tenfold causes the power received to decrease by a factor of 106 = 1000000. As a result, inductive and capacitive coupling can only be used for short-range power transfer, within a few times the diameter of the antenna device &quot;D&quot;ant. Unlike in a radiative system where the maximum radiation occurs when the dipole antennas are oriented transverse to the direction of propagation, with dipole fields the maximum coupling occurs when the dipoles are oriented longitudinally.

=== Inductive coupling ===


In inductive coupling (&quot;electromagnetic induction&quot; or &quot;inductive power transfer&quot;, IPT), power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. The transmitter and receiver coils together form a transformer. An alternating current (AC) through the transmitter coil &quot;(L1)&quot; creates an oscillating magnetic field &quot;(B)&quot; by Ampere&#x27;s law. The magnetic field passes through the receiving coil &quot;(L2)&quot;, where it induces an alternating EMF (voltage) by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction, which creates an alternating current in the receiver. The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current (DC) by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at 50/60 Hz so AC mains current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an electronic oscillator generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with frequency.

Inductive coupling is the oldest and most widely used wireless power technology, and virtually the only one so far which is used in commercial products. It is used in inductive charging stands for cordless appliances used in wet environments such as electric toothbrushes and shavers, to reduce the risk of electric shock. Another application area is &quot;transcutaneous&quot; recharging of biomedical prosthetic devices implanted in the human body, such as cardiac pacemakers, to avoid having wires passing through the skin. It is also used to charge electric vehicles such as cars and to either charge or power transit vehicles like buses and trains.

However the fastest growing use is wireless charging pads to recharge mobile and handheld wireless devices such as laptop and tablet computers, computer mouse, cellphones, digital media players, and video game controllers. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) provided its first certification for a wireless transmission charging system in December 2017.

The power transferred increases with frequency and the mutual inductance formula_1 between the coils, which depends on their geometry and the distance formula_2 between them. A widely used figure of merit is the coupling coefficient formula_3. This dimensionless parameter is equal to the fraction of magnetic flux through the transmitter coil formula_4 that passes through the receiver coil formula_5 when L2 is open circuited. If the two coils are on the same axis and close together so all the magnetic flux from formula_4 passes through formula_5, formula_8 and the link efficiency approaches 100%. The greater the separation between the coils, the more of the magnetic field from the first coil misses the second, and the lower formula_9 and the link efficiency are, approaching zero at large separations. The link efficiency and power transferred is roughly proportional to formula_10. In order to achieve high efficiency, the coils must be very close together, a fraction of the coil diameter formula_11, usually within centimeters, with the coils&#x27; axes aligned. Wide, flat coil shapes are usually used, to increase coupling. Ferrite &quot;flux confinement&quot; cores can confine the magnetic fields, improving coupling and reducing interference to nearby electronics, but they are heavy and bulky so small wireless devices often use air-core coils.

Ordinary inductive coupling can only achieve high efficiency when the coils are very close together, usually adjacent. In most modern inductive systems resonant inductive coupling is used, in which the efficiency is increased by using resonant circuits. This can achieve high efficiencies at greater distances than nonresonant inductive coupling.

=== Resonant inductive coupling ===


Resonant inductive coupling (&quot;electrodynamic coupling&quot;, &quot;strongly coupled magnetic resonance&quot;) is a form of inductive coupling in which power is transferred by magnetic fields &quot;(B, green)&quot; between two resonant circuits (tuned circuits), one in the transmitter and one in the receiver. Each resonant circuit consists of a coil of wire connected to a capacitor, or a self-resonant coil or other resonator with internal capacitance. The two are tuned to resonate at the same resonant frequency. The resonance between the coils can greatly increase coupling and power transfer, analogously to the way a vibrating tuning fork can induce sympathetic vibration in a distant fork tuned to the same pitch.

Nikola Tesla first discovered resonant coupling during his pioneering experiments in wireless power transfer around the turn of the 20th century, but the possibilities of using resonant coupling to increase transmission range has only recently been explored. In 2007 a team led by Marin Soljačić at MIT used two coupled tuned circuits each made of a 25 cm self-resonant coil of wire at 10 MHz to achieve the transmission of 60 W of power over a distance of (8 times the coil diameter) at around 40% efficiency.

The concept behind resonant inductive coupling systems is that high Q factor resonators exchange energy at a much higher rate than they lose energy due to internal damping. Therefore, by using resonance, the same amount of power can be transferred at greater distances, using the much weaker magnetic fields out in the peripheral regions (&quot;tails&quot;) of the near fields. Resonant inductive coupling can achieve high efficiency at ranges of 4 to 10 times the coil diameter (&quot;D&quot;ant). This is called &quot;mid-range&quot; transfer, in contrast to the &quot;short range&quot; of nonresonant inductive transfer, which can achieve similar efficiencies only when the coils are adjacent. Another advantage is that resonant circuits interact with each other so much more strongly than they do with nonresonant objects that power losses due to absorption in stray nearby objects are negligible.

A drawback of resonant coupling theory is that at close ranges when the two resonant circuits are tightly coupled, the resonant frequency of the system is no longer constant but &quot;splits&quot; into two resonant peaks, so the maximum power transfer no longer occurs at the original resonant frequency and the oscillator frequency must be tuned to the new resonance peak.

Resonant technology is currently being widely incorporated in modern inductive wireless power systems. One of the possibilities envisioned for this technology is area wireless power coverage. A coil in the wall or ceiling of a room might be able to wirelessly power lights and mobile devices anywhere in the room, with reasonable efficiency. An environmental and economic benefit of wirelessly powering small devices such as clocks, radios, music players and remote controls is that it could drastically reduce the 6 billion batteries disposed of each year, a large source of toxic waste and groundwater contamination.

A study for the Swedish military found that 85 kHz systems for dynamic wireless power transfer for vehicles can cause electromagnetic interference at a radius of up to 300 kilometers.

=== Capacitive coupling ===
Capacitive coupling also referred to as electric coupling, makes use of electric fields for the transmission of power between two electrodes (an anode and cathode) forming a capacitance for the transfer of power. In capacitive coupling (electrostatic induction), the conjugate of inductive coupling, energy is transmitted by electric fields between electrodes such as metal plates. The transmitter and receiver electrodes form a capacitor, with the intervening space as the dielectric. An alternating voltage generated by the transmitter is applied to the transmitting plate, and the oscillating electric field induces an alternating potential on the receiver plate by electrostatic induction, which causes an alternating current to flow in the load circuit. The amount of power transferred increases with the frequency the square of the voltage, and the capacitance between the plates, which is proportional to the area of the smaller plate and (for short distances) inversely proportional to the separation.

Capacitive coupling has only been used practically in a few low power applications, because the very high voltages on the electrodes required to transmit significant power can be hazardous, and can cause unpleasant side effects such as noxious ozone production. In addition, in contrast to magnetic fields, electric fields interact strongly with most materials, including the human body, due to dielectric polarization. Intervening materials between or near the electrodes can absorb the energy, in the case of humans possibly causing excessive electromagnetic field exposure. However capacitive coupling has a few advantages over inductive coupling. The field is largely confined between the capacitor plates, reducing interference, which in inductive coupling requires heavy ferrite &quot;flux confinement&quot; cores. Also, alignment requirements between the transmitter and receiver are less critical. Capacitive coupling has recently been applied to charging battery powered portable devices as well as charging or continuous wireless power transfer in biomedical implants, and is being considered as a means of transferring power between substrate layers in integrated circuits.

Two types of circuit have been used:

* Transverse (bipolar) design: In this type of circuit, there are two transmitter plates and two receiver plates. Each transmitter plate is coupled to a receiver plate. The transmitter oscillator drives the transmitter plates in opposite phase (180° phase difference) by a high alternating voltage, and the load is connected between the two receiver plates. The alternating electric fields induce opposite phase alternating potentials in the receiver plates, and this &quot;push-pull&quot; action causes current to flow back and forth between the plates through the load. A disadvantage of this configuration for wireless charging is that the two plates in the receiving device must be aligned face to face with the charger plates for the device to work. 
* Longitudinal (unipolar) design: In this type of circuit, the transmitter and receiver have only one active electrode, and either the ground or a large passive electrode serves as the return path for the current. The transmitter oscillator is connected between an active and a passive electrode. The load is also connected between an active and a passive electrode. The electric field produced by the transmitter induces alternating charge displacement in the load dipole through electrostatic induction.

Resonance can also be used with capacitive coupling to extend the range. At the turn of the 20th century, Nikola Tesla did the first experiments with both resonant inductive and capacitive coupling.

=== Electrodynamic wireless power transfer ===

An electrodynamic wireless power transfer (EWPT) system utilizes a receiver with a mechanically resonating or rotating permanent magnet. When subjected to a time-varying magnetic field, the mechanical motion of the resonating magnet is converted into electricity by one or more electromechanical transduction schemes (e.g. electromagnetic/induction, piezoelectric, or capacitive). In contrast to inductive coupling systems which usually use high frequency magnetic fields, EWPT uses low-frequency magnetic fields (&lt;1 kHz), which safely pass through conductive media and have higher human field exposure limits (~2 mTrms at 1 kHz), showing promise for potential use in wirelessly recharging biomedical implants. 
For EWPT devices having identical resonant frequencies, the magnitude of power transfer is entirely dependent on critical coupling coefficient, denoted by formula_9, between the transmitter and receiver devices. For coupled resonators with same resonant frequencies, wireless power transfer between the transmitter and the receiver is spread over three regimes – under-coupled, critically coupled and over-coupled. As the critical coupling coefficient increases from an under-coupled regime (formula_13) to the critical coupled regime, the optimum voltage gain curve grows in magnitude (measured at the receiver) and peaks when formula_14 and then enters into the over-coupled regime where formula_15 and the peak splits into two. This critical coupling coefficient is demonstrated to be a function of distance between the source and the receiver devices.

=== Magnetodynamic coupling ===
In this method, power is transmitted between two rotating armatures, one in the transmitter and one in the receiver, which rotate synchronously, coupled together by a magnetic field generated by permanent magnets on the armatures. The transmitter armature is turned either by or as the rotor of an electric motor, and its magnetic field exerts torque on the receiver armature, turning it. The magnetic field acts like a mechanical coupling between the armatures. The receiver armature produces power to drive the load, either by turning a separate electric generator or by using the receiver armature itself as the rotor in a generator.

This device has been proposed as an alternative to inductive power transfer for noncontact charging of electric vehicles. A rotating armature embedded in a garage floor or curb would turn a receiver armature in the underside of the vehicle to charge its batteries. It is claimed that this technique can transfer power over distances of 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 inches) with high efficiency, over 90%. Also, the low frequency stray magnetic fields produced by the rotating magnets produce less electromagnetic interference to nearby electronic devices than the high frequency magnetic fields produced by inductive coupling systems. A prototype system charging electric vehicles has been in operation at University of British Columbia since 2012. Other researchers, however, claim that the two energy conversions (electrical to mechanical to electrical again) make the system less efficient than electrical systems like inductive coupling.

=== Zenneck wave transmission===

A new kind of system using the Zenneck type waves was shown by Oruganti et al., where they demonstrated that it was possible to excite Zenneck wave type waves on flat metal-air interfaces and transmit power across metal obstacles.
Here the idea is to excite a localized charge oscillation at the metal-air interface, the resulting modes propagate along the metal-air interface.

== Far-field (radiative) techniques ==
Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often multiple kilometer ranges, where the distance is much greater than the diameter of the device(s). High-directivity antennas or well-collimated laser light produce a beam of energy that can be made to match the shape of the receiving area. The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.

In general, visible light (from lasers) and microwaves (from purpose-designed antennas) are the forms of electromagnetic radiation best suited to energy transfer.

The dimensions of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy&#x27;s diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a blue laser is diffracted less than a red one.

The Rayleigh limit (also known as the Abbe diffraction limit), although originally applied to image resolution, can be viewed in reverse, and dictates that the irradiance (or &quot;intensity&quot;) of any electromagnetic wave (such as a microwave or laser beam) will be reduced as the beam diverges over distance at a minimum rate inversely proportional to the aperture size. The larger the ratio of a transmitting antenna&#x27;s aperture or laser&#x27;s exit aperture to the wavelength of radiation, the more can the radiation be concentrated in a compact beam.

Microwave power beaming can be more efficient than lasers, and is less prone to atmospheric attenuation caused by dust or aerosols such as fog.

Here, the power levels are calculated by combining the parameters together, and adding in the gains and losses due to the antenna characteristics and the transparency and dispersion of the medium through which the radiation passes. That process is known as calculating a link budget.

=== Microwaves ===
Power transmission via radio waves can be made more directional, allowing longer-distance power beaming, with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the microwave range. A rectenna may be used to convert the microwave energy back into electricity. Rectenna conversion efficiencies exceeding 95% have been realized. Power beaming using microwaves has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and the beaming of power to spacecraft leaving orbit has been considered.

Power beaming by microwaves has the difficulty that, for most space applications, the required aperture sizes are very large due to diffraction limiting antenna directionality. For example, the 1978 NASA study of solar power satellites required a transmitting antenna and a receiving rectenna for a microwave beam at 2.45 GHz. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although short wavelengths may have difficulties with atmospheric absorption and beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the &quot;thinned-array curse&quot;, it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites.

For earthbound applications, a large-area 10 km diameter receiving array allows large total power levels to be used while operating at the low power density suggested for human electromagnetic exposure safety. A human safe power density of 1 mW/cm2 distributed across a 10 km diameter area corresponds to 750 megawatts total power level. This is the power level found in many modern electric power plants. For comparison, a solar PV farm of similar size might easily exceed 10,000 megawatts (rounded) at best conditions during daytime.

Following World War II, which saw the development of high-power microwave emitters known as cavity magnetrons, the idea of using microwaves to transfer power was researched. By 1964, a miniature helicopter propelled by microwave power had been demonstrated.

Japanese researcher Hidetsugu Yagi also investigated wireless energy transmission using a directional array antenna that he designed. In February 1926, Yagi and his colleague Shintaro Uda published their first paper on the tuned high-gain directional array now known as the Yagi antenna. While it did not prove to be particularly useful for power transmission, this beam antenna has been widely adopted throughout the broadcasting and wireless telecommunications industries due to its excellent performance characteristics.

Wireless high power transmission using microwaves is well proven. Experiments in the tens of kilowatts have been performed at the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California in 1975 and more recently (1997) at Grand Bassin on Reunion Island. These methods achieve distances on the order of a kilometer.

Under experimental conditions, microwave conversion efficiency was measured to be around 54% across one meter.

A change to 24 GHz has been suggested as microwave emitters similar to LEDs have been made with very high quantum efficiencies using negative resistance, i.e., Gunn or IMPATT diodes, and this would be viable for short range links.

In 2013, inventor Hatem Zeine demonstrated how wireless power transmission using phased array antennas can deliver electrical power up to 30 feet. It uses the same radio frequencies as WiFi.

In 2015, researchers at the University of Washington introduced power over Wi-Fi, which trickle-charges batteries and powered battery-free cameras and temperature sensors using transmissions from Wi-Fi routers. Wi-Fi signals were shown to power battery-free temperature and camera sensors at ranges of up to 20 feet. It was also shown that Wi-Fi can be used to wirelessly trickle-charge nickel–metal hydride and lithium-ion coin-cell batteries at distances of up to 28 feet.

In 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) certified the first mid-field radio frequency (RF) transmitter of wireless power. In 2021 the FCC granted a license to an over-the-air (OTA) wireless charging system that combines near-field and far-field methods by using a frequency of about 900 MHz. Due to the radiated power of about 1 W this system is intended for small IoT devices as various sensors, trackers, detectors and monitors.

=== Lasers ===
In the case of electromagnetic radiation closer to the visible region of the spectrum (.2 to 2 micrometers), power can be transmitted by converting electricity into a laser beam that is received and concentrated onto photovoltaic cells (solar cells). This mechanism is generally known as &#x27;power beaming&#x27; because the power is beamed at a receiver that can convert it to electrical energy. At the receiver, special photovoltaic laser power converters which are optimized for monochromatic light conversion are applied.

Advantages compared to other wireless methods are:

* Collimated monochromatic wavefront propagation allows narrow beam cross-section area for transmission over large distances. As a result, there is little or no reduction in power when increasing the distance from the transmitter to the receiver.
* Compact size: solid state lasers fit into small products.
* No radio-frequency interference to existing radio communication such as Wi-Fi and cell phones.
* Access control: only receivers hit by the laser receive power.

Drawbacks include:

* Laser radiation is hazardous. Without a proper safety mechanism, low power levels can blind humans and other animals. High power levels can kill through localized spot heating.
* Optical to electrical conversion efficiency of photovoltaic cells is limited. However, special photovoltaic power converters for laser light have demonstrated efficiencies up to 68.9% 
* Atmospheric absorption, and absorption and scattering by clouds, fog, rain, etc., causes up to 100% losses.
* Requires a direct line of sight with the target. (Instead of being beamed directly onto the receiver, the laser light can also be guided by an optical fiber. Then one speaks of power-over-fiber technology.)

Laser &quot;power beaming&quot; technology was explored in military weapons and aerospace applications. Also, it is applied for the powering of various kinds of sensors in industrial environments. Lately, it is developed for powering commercial and consumer electronics. Wireless energy transfer systems using lasers for consumer space have to satisfy laser safety requirements standardized under IEC 60825.

The first wireless power system using lasers for consumer applications was Wi-Charge, demonstrated in 2018, capable of delivering power to stationary and moving devices across a room. This wireless power system complies with safety regulations according to IEC 60825 standard. It is also approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA).

Other details include propagation, and the coherence and the range limitation problem.

Geoffrey Landis is one of the pioneers of solar power satellites and laser-based transfer of energy, especially for space and lunar missions. The demand for safe and frequent space missions has resulted in proposals for a laser-powered space elevator.

NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center has demonstrated a lightweight unmanned model plane powered by a laser beam. This proof-of-concept demonstrates the feasibility of periodic recharging using a laser beam system.

Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a proof-of-concept of utilizing a dual-wavelength laser to wirelessly charge portable devices or UAVs.

=== Atmospheric plasma channel coupling ===
In atmospheric plasma channel coupling, energy is transferred between two electrodes by electrical conduction through ionized air. When an electric field gradient exists between the two electrodes, exceeding 34 kilovolts per centimeter at sea level atmospheric pressure, an electric arc occurs. This atmospheric dielectric breakdown results in the flow of electric current along a random trajectory through an ionized plasma channel between the two electrodes. An example of this is natural lightning, where one electrode is a virtual point in a cloud and the other is a point on Earth. Laser Induced Plasma Channel (LIPC) research is presently underway using ultrafast lasers to artificially promote development of the plasma channel through the air, directing the electric arc, and guiding the current across a specific path in a controllable manner. The laser energy reduces the atmospheric dielectric breakdown voltage and the air is made less insulating by superheating, which lowers the density (formula_16) of the filament of air.

This new process is being explored for use as a laser lightning rod and as a means to trigger lightning bolts from clouds for natural lightning channel studies, for artificial atmospheric propagation studies, as a substitute for conventional radio antennas, for applications associated with electric welding and machining, for diverting power from high-voltage capacitor discharges, for directed-energy weapon applications employing electrical conduction through a ground return path, and electronic jamming.

== Energy harvesting ==
In the context of wireless power, &quot;energy harvesting&quot;, also called &quot;power harvesting&quot; or &quot;energy scavenging&quot;, is the conversion of ambient energy from the environment to electric power, mainly to power small autonomous wireless electronic devices. The ambient energy may come from stray electric or magnetic fields or radio waves from nearby electrical equipment, light, thermal energy (heat), or kinetic energy such as vibration or motion of the device. Although the efficiency of conversion is usually low and the power gathered often minuscule (milliwatts or microwatts), it can be adequate to run or recharge small micropower wireless devices such as remote sensors, which are proliferating in many fields. This new technology is being developed to eliminate the need for battery replacement or charging of such wireless devices, allowing them to operate completely autonomously.

== Uses ==

Inductive power transfer between nearby wire coils was the earliest wireless power technology to be developed, existing since the transformer was developed in the 1800s. Induction heating has been used since the early 1900s and is used for induction cooking.

With the advent of cordless devices, induction charging stands have been developed for appliances used in wet environments, like electric toothbrushes and electric razors, to eliminate the hazard of electric shock. One of the earliest proposed applications of inductive transfer was to power electric locomotives. In 1892 Maurice Hutin and Maurice Leblanc patented a wireless method of powering railroad trains using resonant coils inductively coupled to a track wire at 3 kHz.

In the early 1960s resonant inductive wireless energy transfer was used successfully in implantable medical devices including such devices as pacemakers and artificial hearts. While the early systems used a resonant receiver coil, later systems implemented resonant transmitter coils as well. These medical devices are designed for high efficiency using low power electronics while efficiently accommodating some misalignment and dynamic twisting of the coils. The separation between the coils in implantable applications is commonly less than 20 cm. Today resonant inductive energy transfer is regularly used for providing electric power in many commercially available medical implantable devices.

The first passive RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technologies were invented by Mario Cardullo (1973) and Koelle et al. (1975) and by the 1990s were being used in proximity cards and contactless smartcards.

The proliferation of portable wireless communication devices such as mobile phones, tablet, and laptop computers in recent decades is currently driving the development of mid-range wireless powering and charging technology to eliminate the need for these devices to be tethered to wall plugs during charging. The Wireless Power Consortium was established in 2008 to develop interoperable standards across manufacturers. Its Qi inductive power standard published in August 2009 enables high efficiency charging and powering of portable devices of up to 5 watts over distances of 4 cm (1.6 inches). The wireless device is placed on a flat charger plate (which can be embedded in table tops at cafes, for example) and power is transferred from a flat coil in the charger to a similar one in the device. In 2007, a team led by Marin Soljačić at MIT used a dual resonance transmitter with a 25 cm diameter secondary tuned to 10 MHz to transfer 60 W of power to a similar dual resonance receiver over a distance of (eight times the transmitter coil diameter) at around 40% efficiency.

In 2008 the team of Greg Leyh and Mike Kennan of Nevada Lightning Lab used a grounded dual resonance transmitter with a 57 cm diameter secondary tuned to 60 kHz and a similar grounded dual resonance receiver to transfer power through coupled electric fields with an earth current return circuit over a distance of . In 2011, Dr. Christopher A. Tucker and Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading, recreated Tesla&#x27;s 1900 patent 0,645,576 in miniature and demonstrated power transmission over with a coil diameter of at a resonant frequency of 27.50 MHz, with an effective efficiency of 60%.

A major motivation for microwave research in the 1970s and 1980s was to develop a satellite for space-based solar power. Conceived in 1968 by Peter Glaser, this would harvest energy from sunlight using solar cells and beam it down to Earth as microwaves to huge rectennas, which would convert it to electrical energy on the electric power grid. In landmark 1975 experiments as technical director of a JPL/Raytheon program, Brown demonstrated long-range transmission by beaming 475 W of microwave power to a rectenna a mile away, with a microwave to DC conversion efficiency of 54%. At NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, he and Robert Dickinson transmitted 30 kW DC output power across 1.5 km with 2.38 GHz microwaves from a 26 m dish to a 7.3 x 3.5 m rectenna array. The incident-RF to DC conversion efficiency of the rectenna was 80%. In 1983 Japan launched Microwave Ionosphere Nonlinear Interaction Experiment (MINIX), a rocket experiment to test transmission of high power microwaves through the ionosphere.

In recent years a focus of research has been the development of wireless-powered drone aircraft, which began in 1959 with the Dept. of Defense&#x27;s RAMP (Raytheon Airborne Microwave Platform) project which sponsored Brown&#x27;s research. In 1987 Canada&#x27;s Communications Research Center developed a small prototype airplane called Stationary High Altitude Relay Platform (SHARP) to relay telecommunication data between points on earth similar to a communications satellite. Powered by a rectenna, it could fly at 13 miles (21 km) altitude and stay aloft for months. In 1992 a team at Kyoto University built a more advanced craft called MILAX (MIcrowave Lifted Airplane eXperiment).

In 2003 NASA flew the first laser powered aircraft. The small model plane&#x27;s motor was powered by electricity generated by photocells from a beam of infrared light from a ground-based laser, while a control system kept the laser pointed at the plane.

<text>The Mitsubishi 3000GT is a front-engine, all-wheel/front-wheel drive grand touring/sports car manufactured and marketed by Mitsubishi from 1990 until 2000 over three different series. Manufactured in a three-door hatchback coupé body style in Nagoya, Japan, the 2+2 four-seaters were marketed in the Japanese domestic market as the GTO, and globally as 3000GT. In North America, it was sold both as the Mitsubishi 3000GT (1991–1999) and the Dodge Stealth (1991–1996), a badge engineered, mechanically identical captive import. As a collaborative effort between Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors, Chrysler was responsible for the Stealth&#x27;s exterior styling.

The car was based on Mitsubishi&#x27;s Sigma/Diamante and retained their transverse mounted 3-liter, 24-valve V6 engines and front-wheel-drive layout. The GTO&#x27;s engines were naturally aspirated or with twin-turbochargers and were also available with active aerodynamics (automatically adjusting front and rear spoilers), four-wheel-steering, full-time all-wheel-drive and adaptive suspension.

Mitsubishi marketed a retractable hardtop variant, which were engineered and converted from coupé models in California by ASC, and sold as the &quot;GT Spyder&quot; or &quot;VR4 Spyder&quot; for model years 1993–1995. These were the first fully automated retractable hardtop marketed since the 1959 Ford Skyliner.

The JDM model took its name from the Galant GTO, a two-door hardtop coupé marketed by the company in the early 1970s, which in turn took its name from the Ferrari 250 GTO, short for &quot;Gran Turismo Omologata&quot; – &quot;Omologata&quot; signifying that it met motorsport homologation requirements.

==Overview==
Following the successful showing of the Mitsubishi HSR and Mitsubishi HSX concept cars at the 1989 Tokyo Motor Show, Mitsubishi unveiled the new GTO as a 2+2 seating grand touring car in order to compete with the Mazda RX-7, Nissan 300ZX, Honda NSX, Subaru SVX, and the Toyota Supra. They resurrected the GTO name, and the car went on to serve as Mitsubishi&#x27;s flagship for the remainder of the decade. Despite the cachet of the badge at home, it was marketed as the Mitsubishi 3000GT and as the Dodge Stealth outside Japan; the company was concerned that connoisseurs would object to the evocative nameplate from the Ferrari 250 GTO and Pontiac GTO being used on a Japanese vehicle.

Each was built on the same production line at Mitsubishi&#x27;s plant in Nagoya, Japan. Its Japanese introduction coincided with the softening Japanese economy, subsequently known as the &quot;bubble economy&quot;.

JDM GTOs were marketed at Mitsubishi&#x27;s &quot;Car Plaza&quot; retail chain, with JDM buyers paying additional annual road tax as well as elevated taxes for being classified as a large car by Japan&#x27;s exterior dimension regulations.

A Dodge Stealth was scheduled as a 1991 Indianapolis 500 pace car, until the United Auto Workers (UAW) rejected it because of its Japanese rather than US-manufacture. A prototype of the Dodge Viper was substituted in place of it. Still used as a backup pace car, eventual race winner Rick Mears received a Dodge Stealth for winning the race and dealers sold pace car replica editions, as the Viper did not begin production until later that year.

==1990–1993 (Series 1) ==
Early models were internally designated Z16A and incorporated full-time four-wheel drive and four-wheel steering which was labeled as Mitsubishi AWC. Active aerodynamics called &quot;Active Aero Control System&quot; enhanced the coke bottle silhouette body styling, achieving a drag coefficient of , with automatically deploying front and rear spoilers, sport/tour exhaust modes called &quot;Active Exhaust System&quot;, pop-up headlights and articulated blister caps on the hood to accommodate the ECS controllers at the top of the strut turrets. The Dodge Stealth featured a signature cross-hair front bumper fascia, different B-pillar and quarter window treatments, and crescent-shaped rear spoiler — and did not include active aerodynamics. In 1993, the engine went to a 4-bolt main and a forged crankshaft, some of the early production models still received the cast crank.

===North American market===
In North America, both the Mitsubishi 3000GT as well as the Dodge Stealth were available. Two different powertrains were offered on the 3000GT while the Stealth had three different options. The base 3-door hatchback Stealth came equipped with a 3.0-liter 12-valve SOHC V6 engine producing at 5,500rpm. The base 3000GT and SL model and the Dodge Stealth ES and R/T model came equipped with a 3.0-liter DOHC V6 engine producing . The VR-4 (Viscous Realtime 4WD) and R/T Turbo came equipped with a twin turbocharged 3.0-liter DOHC V6 engine producing at 5,500 rpm. A 5-speed Getrag manual transmission was standard and a 4-speed INVECS automatic was an option on all models except the turbocharged variants. The 3000GT SL and Stealth R/T included an electronically-controlled suspension as well as other features such as anti-lock brakes and automatic climate control while the turbocharged models further added performance options such as permanent 4-wheel drive, 4-wheel steering, limited-slip differential, active aerodynamics and came with Z rated 17-inch tires.
===European market===
In Europe, instead of the Mitsubishi-built TD04-09B turbochargers used on Japanese and US Twin Turbo models that generated , the EU-spec model received the higher capacity TD04-13G turbochargers which generated . While power output is no higher than contemporary market models, these have lower discharge temperatures to better handle the prolonged high speeds possible on the German Autobahn, along with an upgraded transmission. The engine was rated at ; the modifications took time and European models only went on sale in the Autumn of 1992.

===Reviews and performance===
Automotive magazines quoted 0- acceleration times ranging from 4.9 seconds to 6.0 seconds and quarter mile times of 13.6-13.9 seconds at Dodge claims a 0-60 of 4.89 seconds for the 1991 R/T turbo models.

Magazines from the era praised its strong acceleration and grip as well as its full time AWD system allowing for all season use. In a comparison test by AutoWeek the $34,423 ($ in dollars ) 1991 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4 did 0-60 mph in 5.1 seconds beating the lighter $61,000 ($ in dollars ) Acura NSX which hit 60 mph in 5.3 seconds.

==1994–1997 (Series 2)==
Facelift models were internally designated Z15A (2WS) and Z16A (4WS) and featured a revised front bumper to accommodate projector beam headlights and small, round projector fog lights. They were unveiled in August 1993 in Japan and gradually made their way to other markets as the earlier cars sold out. Some markets, such as the UK, did not get these models until as late as 1996. The caps on the hood were replaced with integrated sheet metal blisters, and revised side air vents and rear bumpers were added. The interior was redesigned with dual air bags, a new audio system, and revised air conditioning refrigerant. The engines in the twin-turbo models received an increase to and an increase in torque from when MIVEC variable valve technology was introduced in 1995, and as a result Japanese models received an increase in torque, but the power rating remained unchanged at .

The VR-4 model now included a six-speed Getrag manual transmission with revised gear ratios. Larger wheel/tire combinations were available beginning in 1995. The base and SL model received 16-inch wheels in silver or chrome with 225/55 tires, while the VR-4 now had 18-inch chrome wheels with 245/40 tires (the Spyder had the standard 17-inch with higher profile tires from 1994 to handle the additional of weight).

With subsequent price increases, features were discontinued: the tunable exhaust was phased out after 1994 model year, the ECS after 1995 model year, and the active aerodynamics disappeared after 1996. This was also when Chrysler ceased sales of the Dodge Stealth captive import, and for the remainder of its life only Mitsubishi-badged versions were available.

===Spyder===
Chrysler and Mitsubishi worked with ASC to engineer and convert 3000GTs into retractable hardtops, marketed as the Spyder SL and Spyder VR4 for 1995 and 1996 model years.

In 1995, Mitsubishi&#x27;s 3000GT Spyder was available in four color combinations: red with grey leather interior, black with ivory leather interior, white pearl with grey, and martinique yellow with ivory leather interior. In 1996 the 3000GT Spyder was available in red with tan interior, black pearl with tan leather, white pearl with tan leather interior, and green pearl with tan leather. SL Spyders were only available with an automatic transmission while the VR4 Spyder was only available with a 6-speed manual transmission.

===GTO MR===
The GTO MR model appeared in the Japanese market in August 1994. The ‘Mitsubishi Racing’ or MR moniker, has been used on a few other performance Mitsubishis such as the Lancer Evolution, and usually meant a lighter model. The GTO MR was essentially a lightweight GTO Twin Turbo that deleted 4WS, ABS, ECS and Active Aero, but was mechanically identical to the normal GTO Twin Turbo aside from a final drive ratio of 4.154. Available as an option were AP Racing 6 pot brakes, used on the N1 spec GTO. Chassis numbers for the MR start with Z15A. This lowered the weight of the MR to . The AWD system featured in the MR received the same 45% front 55% rear split ratio as the other turbo models.

Best Motoring, a Japanese television program about Japanese cars, featured the 1994 GTO MR in an hour long program where it beat the lighter R32 Skyline GT-R over a mile in acceleration.

===Beckenbauer edition===
In 1994, Mitsubishi released a limited edition of what was now the previous generation 3000GT, branded as &quot;Beckenbauer Edition.&quot; Honoring Franz Beckenbauer. All were painted Lamborghini yellow and were equipped with a Remus sports exhaust, OZ Futura rims, a numbered plate signed by Beckenbauer, and a C-Netz mobile phone system. Only 30 were made, sold through 1995.

===Reception===
The redesign of the second generation 3000GT brought it up to date, especially through the loss of pop-up headlights and the front strut caps and resulting smoother hood. The Tuneable Exhaust System was phased out in 1995 and the Active Aero was phased out in 1996. A notable change was the brake redesign, facelift models received 2-piston rear brake calipers and larger front brakes that showed no sign of fading under heavy use unlike the early models. Braking distances improved slightly. The new 6-speed was geared well and paired with the extra horsepower and torque allowed the car to out-accelerate its rivals from a standing start.
These changes made all models lighter, the VR-4 was now 3,737 pounds and the SL 3,263 pounds.

Road tests at the time showed the second generation 3000GT VR-4 to be capable of in 4.8 - 5.4 seconds and the quarter mile in 13.5 seconds at , making it faster in a straight line than the Nissan 300ZX Twin Turbo and Mazda RX-7 Twin Turbo. Though heavy, it was comfortable and easy to drive fast. Thanks to the ample power, it could be taken around a track quickly, with noted under steer and a lack of feedback.

==1997–2000 (Series 3)==
The SOHC engine was added to the Mitsubishi 3000GTs after the discontinuation of the Stealth. The 3000GT&#x27;s featuring the single cam engine had a weight of 3131 pounds provided that they were not offered with the sunroof and leather seats.

The 1997-2000 3000GTs are separated by pre- or post-facelift. Slower sales in the American sports car market led to the major facelift plans for 1997 being abandoned. Minor cosmetic changes were implemented instead including a new front bumper and rainbow-shaped arched type wing.

In 1999, the car received its last exterior makeover facelift; with the new aggressive front bumper, headlamps, turn signals and sail panels. A true inverted airfoil spoiler coined the &quot;Combat Wing&quot; only for the 1999 VR-4 were used to distinguish it from previous models. Non-Turbo models did not receive the &quot;Combat Wing&quot; and kept the arched spoiler from the pre-facelift. 1999 was the final year the 3000GT was available in the U.S. market. With sales slowing to a trickle and new side impact regulations looming, production for the Japanese domestic market finally ceased in 2000. A last two cars were sold the following year. In a test by Popular Mechanics the USDM 1999 3000GT VR-4 ran a 13.44 seconds quarter mile (~402 m) at .

<doc id="570673" wikidata="Q3287743" url="?curid=570673" title="Rare groove">
<text>Rare groove is music that is very hard to source or relatively obscure. Rare groove is primarily associated with funk, R&amp;B and jazz funk, but is also connected to subgenres including jazz rock, reggae, Latin jazz, soul, rock music, northern soul, and disco. Vinyl records that fall into this category generally have high re-sale prices. Rare groove records have been sought by not only collectors and lovers of this type of music, but also by hip hop artists and producers.

Online music retailers sell a wide selection of rare groove at more affordable prices, offering fast downloads in digital format. This availability and ease of access has brought about a resurgence of the genre in recent years.

==History and development==

In the UK, the term &#x27;rare groove&#x27; was originally coined by the British DJ Norman Jay, after his &quot;The Original Rare Groove Show&quot; on pirate radio station Kiss 94 FM (the progenitor of Kiss 100 London). While Norman Jay was actually a witness to, and participant in, the 1970s underground sub-culture of American obscure import music, the person who actually gave rise to the genre (some even credit him with the revival of James Brown&#x27;s career), although there was no name for it at the time, was underground DJ Barrie Sharpe and Lascelles Gordon (previously with the Brand New Heavies). Both played that brand of obscure American import records, 7&quot; and albums (&quot;looking back retrospectively&quot;), that they had in their collection. These were bought from such specialist import record shops such as Moondogs in East Ham, and Contempo record shop at 42 Hanway Street in the West end of London, owned by John Abbey, founder of &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot; magazine. The magazine also had their own record label (also called Contempo), releasing music from the 1970s which, starting in 1984, played at a club previously known as Whisky-A-Go-Go, founded by Rene Gelston in Wardour Street, Soho (which would later become known as The Wag).

Norman Jay&#x27;s show was a collaboration with DJ Judge Jules and featured a mainly urban soundtrack from the 1970s and 1980s mixed with early house music. Tracks similar to &quot;rare grooves&quot; had begun to see a following in the 1970s Northern soul movement, which curated a collection of rare and obscure soul records for play in dance clubs.

The rare groove scene began when DJs presented an eclectic mix of music, that placed a particular emphasis on politically articulate dance-funk recordings, connected to the US Black Power movement. Pirate radio stations and DJs participated in a &quot;recovery, repackaging and retrieval&quot; of obscure music that reflected, related to or translated inequalities of race and gender and the struggles of the civil rights movement. Music that had failed to gain acceptance in a previous time was given a &quot;new lease on life&quot; by DJs on pirate radio stations. Rare groove also provided a musical space where the &quot;symbolic capital&quot; of the music became very important. Northern soul is a part of the rare groove scene since the term was first given by deep soul collector Dave Godin from the record shop Soul City in Covent Garden, London. The scene has many record collectors and DJs who pay large sums of money for rare songs from the 1960s/&#x27;70s/&#x27;80s/&#x27;90s that are original copies.

In America, DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Africa Bambaataa played 70s rare groove records. James Brown, Jimmy Castor Bunch, and Incredible Bongo Band were on their playlists. Popular breakbeats source was bootleg series &quot;Ultimate Breaks and Beats&quot;. The longest-running rare groove radio show in the United States is &quot;Soul Power&quot; on WWOZ 90.7 FM (New Orleans) and wwoz.org, and is hosted by DJ Soul Sister, who is cited as the &quot;queen of rare groove&quot;. The show began in 1996.

==Sampling==
Sampling is one of the biggest aspects of hip hop and rap, and these types of records provide breaks for artists to use in their songs. Examples of rare groove samples, such as Eazy-E&#x27;s &quot;Eazy Duz It&quot; (which samples the Detroit Emeralds, Bootsy Collins, Funkadelic, Isley Brothers, Sly and the Family Stone, the Temptations and even Richard Pryor), can be found in modern hip hop (notably G-funk&#x27;s heavy sampling of Funkadelic).

Schoolly D used samples such as James Brown, Lyn Collins, the J.B.&#x27;s, and Maceo &amp; the Macks on album &quot;Am I Black Enough for You&quot; (1989). DJ Chuck Chillout used samples such as Kool &amp; the Gang, Cameo, Cymande, Talking Heads and Incredible Bongo Band. Stezo also used Lyn Collins, George Clinton, Kool &amp; the Gang and Spoonie Gee.

After the 1970s disco boom was over, many musicians (Bee Gees, Donna Summer, Village People, etc.) who had fame and spotlight in the genre&#x27;s heyday faded away. Much of the obscure music rediscovered as samples in newer house or hip-hop tracks is labeled &quot;rare groove&quot; retroactively.

<text>Timothy Lauro Squire Sprigge (14 January 1932 – 11 July 2007), usually cited as T. L. S. Sprigge, was a British idealist philosopher who spent the latter portion of his career at the University of Edinburgh, where he was Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, and latterly an Emeritus Fellow.

==Biography==
Sprigge was educated at the Dragon School, Oxford, and Bryanston School in Dorset. He studied English at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (1952–1955), then switched to philosophy, completing his PhD under A. J. Ayer. He taught philosophy at University College, London and Sussex University before becoming Regius Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh. 

Long concerned with the nature of experience and the relationship between mind and reality, Sprigge was the philosopher who first posed the question made famous by Thomas Nagel: &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot; Throughout his career he argued that physicalism or materialism is not only false, but has contributed to a distortion of our moral sense. The failure to respect the rights of human beings and non-human animals is therefore largely a metaphysical error of failing to grasp the true reality of the first person, subjective perspective of consciousness, or sentience. The practice of vivisection, which gained wide acceptance with Descartes&#x27;s view of animals as machines, would be an example of this failure. He was an advocate of animal rights and defended an environmental ethic. 

The author of &quot;The Vindication of Absolute Idealism&quot; (1984), Sprigge defended a panpsychist version of absolute idealism, according to which reality consists of bits of experience combined into a certain kind of coherent whole. His work presents several new arguments in favor of the plausibility of such an account. He also defended a version of determinism in which all moments of time are intrinsically present and only relatively past or future. Time is unreal, he argued. What we experience as temporal transition is an illusion. Though a skeptic of traditional theism, Sprigge considered himself a believer in an impersonal God. He would eventually become a Unitarian. In his last book, &quot;The God of Metaphysics&quot; (2006), he argued for the existence of a &quot;God of Philosophers&quot; worthy of worship. Sprigge&#x27;s metaphysics is a creative synthesis of Spinoza, F. H. Bradley, William James, George Santayana and Alfred North Whitehead. Because of his metaphysical monism, panpsychism and rigid determinism, he has been referred to as &quot;Spinoza reincarnated in the twentieth century&quot;. 

A Festschrift for Sprigge appeared on the day he died, &quot;Consciousness, Reality and Value: Essays in Honour of T. L. S. Sprigge&quot; (Ontos Verlag).

He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1991 to 1992 and Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

The Timothy Sprigge Room at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities at the University of Edinburgh contains Sprigge&#x27;s library. The Sprigge Archive is located at the Edinburgh University Library.

<text>Milan Hejduk (; born February 14, 1976) is a Czech–American former professional ice hockey forward. Nicknamed &quot;the Duke&quot;, he spent his entire 14-year National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Colorado Avalanche and retired holding the record for most career games as an Avalanche player with 1,020. In 2003, he won the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading goal scorer. He is a member of Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Playing career==
The 6-foot-tall, 190-pound Hejduk was drafted 87th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the fourth round of the 1994 NHL Entry Draft, after a year with HC Pardubice in the Czech Extraliga, after winning Czech Rookie of the Year with 11 goals in 32 games. He stayed with Pardubice until 1998, scoring 14, 13, 27 and 26 goals in his next four seasons respectively before transferring to the NHL after the 1997–98 season.

Hejduk won the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top goalscorer when he scored 50 goals for the Avalanche in the 2002–03 season, narrowly surpassing Markus Näslund of the Vancouver Canucks, who had been leading for most of the season. Hejduk scored a goal against the Calgary Flames in a 3–0 win for the Avalanche on March 12, 2006, tying him with Peter Forsberg in sixth place on the all-time Avalanche franchise goalscoring list with 216 goals. He won the Stanley Cup in the 2000–01 season with the Avalanche.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Hejduk returned to HC Pardubice, scoring 25 goals in 48 Czech Extraliga games. He won the Extraliga title with Pardubice.

In the 2008–09 season, Hejduk scored his 300th career NHL goal alongside Ryan Smyth on January 18, 2009, against the Calgary Flames in a 6–2 victory at the Pepsi Center. He dressed for all 82 games that year for the Avalanche and ended what was, at that point, their most unsuccessful season in history tied with Smyth as the Avs&#x27; top scorer with 59 points. Milan also led the Avalanche for the fifth time in his career with 27 goals.

Prior to the 2009–10 season, on September 24, 2009, Hejduk signed a new one-year contract with Colorado effective for the 2010–11 season. Alongside long-time teammate and team captain Adam Foote, Hejduk provided veteran leadership to a re-invigorated, youth-laden Avalanche side to start the year. After initially persisting with a knee and back injuries through the first half of the season, on January 19, 2010, Milan opted to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery and forgo participating in the 2010 Winter Olympics with the Czech Republic to recoup. After over one month on the sidelines, Hejduk scored two goals against the St. Louis Blues to mark his return on March 7. In helping Colorado return to the Stanley Cup playoffs, he completed the year to place third on the team with 23 goals despite playing in a career-low 56 games. He scored just one goal in the 2010 playoffs before he succumbed to a head injury after a collision with line-mate Paul Stastny in Game 3 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals series defeat against the San Jose Sharks.

On May 11, 2011, Hejduk signed another one-year contract with the Avalanche effective for the 2011–12 season. On November 14, he was named the third captain in Avalanche history after a brief vacancy was left by Adam Foote&#x27;s retirement. Hejduk saw a decline in his offensive production for his first season as captain. Scoring 14 goals and 37 points in 81 games, this ended his impressive career streak of 12-straight 20-plus-goal seasons. Shortly after the 2011–12 season, after the Avs would miss the playoffs for the second time in two years, Hejduk expressed his consideration to retire from the NHL. Despite these statements, on May 18, 2012, he signed a one-year contract with the Avalanche for the 2012–13 season worth $2 million. In September 2012, he relinquished his captaincy due to his role in the organization changing. He admitted to being happy to have given up his captaincy to a player who he thinks is going to be a franchise player for a long time.

In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Hejduk became the last player drafted by the Quebec Nordiques still active in the NHL, after goaltender Tim Thomas opted for a year on hiatus. On February 4, 2013, in a 3–2 defeat to the Dallas Stars, Hejduk scored a goal in his 1,000th career NHL game. He became the first Avalanche player in history to appear in 1,000 games for the club and the 30th in NHL history to do so at a single franchise. On his 37th birthday, Hejduk scored a goal and a shoot-out goal in a 4–3 victory over the Minnesota Wild on February 14, 2013. The goal marked his 800th point in the NHL, becoming just the third Czech-born player in NHL history to reach the feat, behind only Jaromír Jágr and Patrik Eliáš. Despite the shortened season, Hejduk saw his scoring role reduced by head coach Joe Sacco. With injury and bouts of healthy scratches, he contributed from the checking lines with a career-low 4 goals and 11 points in only 29 games played.

Despite harbouring ambition to continue playing, Hejduk was not offered a new contract by the Avalanche upon the expiry of his contract. He finished his tenure ranked second in Quebec/Colorado franchise history in games played (1,020), fourth in goals (375) and points (805) and fifth in assists (430), while also the all-time franchise leader in overtime goals (9) and second in game-winning goals (59).

Reports surfaced on November 13, 2013, that Hejduk was ending his hockey career, which were confirmed after the 2014 Olympic break. At the time of his retirement, he was the last player to leave the Avalanche that had played on their 2001 Stanley Cup-winning team.

On September 13, 2017, it was announced that the Avalanche would retire Hejduk&#x27;s number 23 jersey during the 2017–18 season, and it was officially retired on January 6, 2018.

===NHL All-Star Games===
Hejduk has been selected to play in three NHL All-Star Games. In the 2000 All-Star Game, he played on the World team in a 9–4 win over North America. He earned a primary assist on Pavol Demitra&#x27;s third period goal. For the 2001 All-Star Game, he was chosen to replace an injured Jaromír Jágr in the starting line-up, one of the six Avalanche players selected as starters. However, he did not record a point in a 14–12 loss to North America. In 2009, he was selected as the only Av in the All-Star lineup for the year&#x27;s Game. He recorded one goal and two assists in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference.

==Personal life==
Hejduk is married to Zlatuse and has twin sons named Marek and David, born January 3, 2004. In 2016, Hejduk became an American citizen. Marek began playing for Harvard in the fall of 2022. David is committed to join the program the following year.

<doc id="570703" wikidata="Q1971758" url="?curid=570703" title="Natural rate of unemployment">
<text>The natural rate of unemployment is the name that was given to a key concept in the study of economic activity. Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, tackling this &#x27;human&#x27; problem in the 1960s, both received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their work, and the development of the concept is cited as a main motivation behind the prize. A simplistic summary of the concept is: &#x27;The natural rate of unemployment, when an economy is in a steady state of &quot;full employment&quot;, is the proportion of the workforce who are unemployed&#x27;. Put another way, this concept clarifies that the economic term &quot;full employment&quot; does not mean &quot;zero unemployment&quot;. It represents the hypothetical unemployment rate consistent with aggregate production being at the &quot;long-run&quot; level. This level is consistent with aggregate production in the absence of various temporary frictions such as incomplete price adjustment in labor and goods markets. The natural rate of unemployment therefore corresponds to the unemployment rate prevailing under a classical view of determination of activity.

The natural unemployment rate is mainly determined by the economy&#x27;s supply side, and hence production possibilities and economic institutions. If these institutional features involve permanent mismatches in the labor market or real wage rigidities, the natural rate of unemployment may feature involuntary unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is a combination of frictional and structural unemployment that persists in an efficient, expanding economy when labor and resource markets are in equilibrium.

Occurrence of disturbances (e.g., cyclical shifts in investment sentiments) will cause actual unemployment to continuously deviate from the natural rate, and be partly determined by aggregate demand factors as under a Keynesian view of output determination. The policy implication is that the natural rate of unemployment cannot permanently be reduced by demand management policies (including monetary policy), but that such policies can play a role in stabilizing variations in actual unemployment.
Reductions in the natural rate of unemployment must, according to the concept, be achieved through structural policies directed towards an economy&#x27;s supply side. According to multiple surveys, two-thirds to three-quarters of economists generally agree with the statement, &quot;There is a natural rate of unemployment to which the economy tends in the long run.&quot;

==Development==
While Friedrich von Hayek had argued attempts to create full employment might trigger uncontrollable inflation, and David Hume noted that increases to the money supply would raise the price of labour as early as 1752, the classic statement regarding the &quot;natural rate&quot; appeared in Milton Friedman&#x27;s 1968 Presidential Address to the American Economic Association:

:&quot;At any moment of time, there is some level of unemployment which has the property that it is consistent with equilibrium in the structure of real wages ... The &#x27;natural rate of unemployment&#x27; ... is the level that would be ground out by the Walrasian system of general equilibrium equations, provided there is embedded in them the actual structural characteristics of the labour and commodity markets, including market imperfections, stochastic variability in demands and supplies, the costs of gathering information about job vacancies, and labor availabilities, the costs of mobility, and so on.&quot;

However, this remained a vision – Friedman never wrote down a model with all of these properties. When he illustrated the idea of the Natural Rate he simply used the standard text-book labor market demand and supply model that was essentially the same as Don Patinkin&#x27;s model of full employment. In this there is a competitive labor market with both labor supply and demand depend on the real wage and the natural rate is simply the competitive equilibrium where demand equals supply. Implicit in his vision is the notion that the natural rate is &quot;Unique&quot;: there is only one level of output and employment that is consistent with equilibrium.

==Phillips curve==
Milton Friedman argued that a natural rate of inflation followed from the Phillips curve. This showed wages tend to rise when unemployment is low. Friedman argued that inflation was the same as wage rises, and built his argument upon a widely believed idea, that a stable negative relation between inflation and unemployment existed. This belief had the policy implication that unemployment could be permanently reduced by expansive demand policy and thus higher inflation.

Friedman and Phelps opposed this idea on theoretical grounds, as they noted that if unemployment were to be permanently lower, some real variable in the economy, like the real wage, would have changed permanently. That this should be the case because inflation was higher appeared to rely on systematic irrationality in the labor market. As Friedman remarked, wage inflation would eventually catch up and leave the real wage, and unemployment, unchanged. Hence, lower unemployment could only be attained as long as wage inflation and inflation expectations lagged behind actual inflation. This was seen to be only a temporary outcome. Eventually, unemployment would return to the rate determined by real factors independent of the inflation rate. According to Friedman and Phelps, the Phillips curve was therefore vertical in the long run, and expansive demand policies would only be a cause of inflation, not a cause of permanently lower unemployment.

Milton Friedman emphasized expectations errors as the main cause of deviation in unemployment from the natural rate. For Friedman, the notion that there was a unique Natural rate was equivalent to his assertion that there is only one level of unemployment at which inflation can be fully anticipated (when actual and expected inflation are the same). Edmund Phelps focused more in detail on the labor market structures and frictions that would cause aggregate demand changes to feed into inflation, and for sluggish expectations, into the determination of the unemployment rate. Also, his theories gave insights into the causes of a too high natural rate of unemployment (i.e., why unemployment could be structural or classical).

==Criticisms==
The major criticism of a natural rate is that there is no credible evidence for it, as Milton Friedman himself said we &quot;cannot know what the &#x27;natural&#x27; rate is&quot;. The natural rate hypothesis makes the fundamental assumption that there exists a unique equilibrium level of unemployment. Importantly, Friedman himself never wrote down an explicit model of the natural rate; in his Nobel Lecture, he just uses the simple labor supply and demand model. Others have argued that there might be multiple equilibria, for example due to search externalities as in the Diamond coconut model or that there might exist a natural range of unemployment levels rather than a unique equilibrium. According to Roger Farmer of UCLA, the assumption that, after a shock, the unemployment rate returns to its natural rate does not hold in the data.

<doc id="570713" wikidata="Q705726" url="?curid=570713" title="John Wimber">
<text>John Richard Wimber (February 25, 1934 – November 17, 1997) was an American pastor, Christian author and musician. Initially ordained as a Quaker minister, he became an early, pioneering pastor of charismatic congregations, and a popular thought leader in modern Christian publications on the third person of the Christian Trinity, the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit&#x27;s action in modern churches through miraculous phenomena referred to as miracles, or signs and wonders. Wimber was a founding leader of the Vineyard Movement, a Christian movement that Kenn Gulliksen began in the United States and that later became a wider denomination.

==Early life==
John Richard Wimber was born on February 25, 1934, in Kirksville, Missouri, to Basil and Genevieve Estelynn (Martin) Wimber. He grew up outside of a religious or faith-based belief system until he became a Christian at the age of 29. Wimber was recognised as a talented musician, and he first played as a professional at the age of 15 at the Dixie Castle in Orange, California. Four years later, in 1953, Wimber won a first prize at the Lighthouse International Jazz Festival.

Wimber was a talented keyboardist, saxophonist, and vocalist. He was a pianist and singer in The Paramours group, later known as The Righteous Brothers, from 1962 to 1963, as well as a manager for The Righteous Brothers during this period. This five-member band preceded Bobby Hatfield and Bill Medley&#x27;s eventual induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He converted to Christianity in 1963, immediately enrolled in Azusa Pacific College, and majored in Biblical Studies. Upon graduating he was ordained as a Quaker minister. He then took a pastoral position with the Yorba Linda Friends Church.

==Career==
By 1970, Wimber was leading 11 different Bible study groups that involved more than 500 people. He was the Founding Director of the Department of Church Growth at the Charles E. Fuller Institute of Evangelism and Church Growth from 1974 to 1978, which was founded by the Fuller Theological Seminary and the Fuller Evangelistic Association. He was also on staff at Yorba Linda Friends Church.

Wimber eventually left the Quaker denomination after being discouraged from operating in the gifts of the Spirit. He formed a house church that would eventually grow into the Vineyard Christian Fellowship (VCF) of Anaheim in 1977.

==Religious views and theology==
Wimber strongly espoused Kingdom theology, and this approach to the charismatic differed from many of his peers and predecessors. Wimber&#x27;s embrace of this new approach led a friend, C. Peter Wagner, to coin the phrase, &quot;The Third Wave of the Holy Spirit&quot; to describe the concept he taught. The Third Wave differed from classic Pentecostalism and the Charismatic movement, foremost, in their approach to speaking in tongues. Whereas the previous groups had emphasized the gift of tongues as the only evidence for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, Wimber and those he influenced emphasized that this was just one of the many spiritual gifts available to believers, as taught in the Bible. His teaching revolutionized what was a major theological stumbling block to some mainstream Evangelicals, and normalized the demonstration of &quot;signs and wonders&quot; in current times. Wimber held influence with a number of them, most famously Jack Deere, C. Peter Wagner, and Wayne Grudem.

Services led by Wimber often included activities, described as Holy Spirit manifestations, where congregants appeared to be drunk, dazed, or uncoordinated. But in the mid-1990s he led the Vineyard movement to split from the Toronto Blessing church primarily on the issue of bizarre manifestations and the church&#x27;s extreme latitude for them.

===Gender roles===
Wimber held a complementarian view of gender roles, however his theology on various issues changed throughout the years. He believed firmly in who God was calling and anointing. In 2006, his daughter-in-law, Christy Wimber planted and led a Vineyard Church in Yorba Linda for eleven years. It was Carol Wimber who did the installation. This view believes the Bible to teach that a husband is called to lovingly lead, protect and provide for his wife and family, and that the wife should joyfully and intelligently affirm and submit to her husband&#x27;s leadership. Complementarians also believe the Bible to teach that men are to bear primary responsibility to lead the church and that therefore only men should be elders. Wimber leaned towards complementarian, however, John was known for growing in his theology and practice. In spite of his complementarian convictions, Wimber permitted at least two notable exceptions: both Jackie Pullinger (Hong Kong) and Ann Watson (England) served as the senior leaders of their respective congregations (although I should mention that Watson viewed her role as exceptional, given the premature death of her husband, and not a position to which women in ordinary circumstances should aspire).&quot;

===Authenticity===
Wimber was very outspoken about maintaining authenticity and doing nothing for religious effect. He was dissatisfied with the way some services were run, was &quot;angry with what appeared to be the manipulation of people for the material gains of the faith healer,&quot; &quot;pushing people over and calling it the power of God,&quot; and accepting money for healing ministry. Wimber was not against manifestations in a service as long as they were real actions of God and not &quot;fleshly and brought out by some sort of display, or promoted by somebody on stage&quot;

===Wider impact and other teachings===
Wimber&#x27;s teaching influenced many Christians, both inside and out of the Vineyard movement. One of the key foundations of his teaching was intimacy with God, rather than religious habit and discipline. Another characteristic is in the area of teaching, which emphasized preaching extensively from the gospels and using Jesus as the model for Christian believers. Wimber also had a deep desire to be active in helping the poor.

He strongly emphasized signs and wonders, which he referred to as &quot;Doin&#x27; the Stuff&quot;, the priesthood of every believer and that every Christian has the ability to prophesy and heal the sick. While this is not a new concept, Wimber was a key figure in the introduction of the concept that praying for the sick (or anything else) should not be reserved for special healing services, but should take place at every Church service, and should be practised on the streets by every believer. As a result, many churches have prayer time after the sermon. The Vineyard worship style has also had a wide influence on the church.

Wimber&#x27;s teaching has had a significant influence on other Charismatic leaders, such as Mike Bickle, Terry Virgo, Randy Clark, John Arnott, Bill Johnson, John Paul Jackson, Sandy Millar, David Pytches and Christy Wimber.

Wimber&#x27;s theology and methods have been challenged by cessationist Christians. Their criticism is mainly concerned with his embrace of Kingdom theology. 

Christy Wimber was handed the responsibility of handling all of John Wimber&#x27;s teachings and writings from his passing in 1997 up until 2018. During those years she produced countless teachings and writings from Wimber&#x27;s years of ministry work. She also documented the Vineyard as a Movement beginning with back to Our Roots series which was completed in 2008. Also, in the 2008 she began working with Regent University in Virginia for twelve years and opened the library in 2018 which is when she then concluded her service to the Wimber legacy with the opening of the Wimber Library.

==Declining health and death==
In 1983 and 1984, Wimber said, &quot;I had suffered minor chest pains every four or five months. I suspected they had something to do with my heart but did nothing about them. Nobody, not even Carol, my wife, knew about my condition.&quot; In October 1985 while in England he was very tired and had chest pains. His wife insisted he get tested. &quot;I had what doctors later suspected were a series of coronary attacks.&quot; The next month his cardiologist confirmed he had a damaged heart and told him that his weight and schedule put him at risk of imminent death. &quot;In 1985 I was away from home for over forty weeks.&quot; &quot;All my life,&quot; Wimber confessed, &quot;I have been a compulsive person, always working and eating more than I should.&quot; In 1986 he had a heart attack.

In 1993 Wimber was diagnosed with sinus cancer. He had successful radiation treatment which lasted a year, but said &quot;at the time I weighed 280 pounds.&quot; In 1995 he had a stroke. In 1997 he had triple-bypass heart surgery. His mental faculties were declining and later that same year Wimber fell in his home and hit his head. This caused a massive brain hemorrhage, from which he died on November 17, 1997, at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, California. He was 63 years old.

Wimber&#x27;s health problems had challenged his theology and experience. After teaching on healing, praying for the sick, and seeing people healed, he openly admitted: &quot;Not only have I suffered physically with health problems, but I also spent a great deal of time struggling with depression during my battle with cancer.&quot; He also commented, &quot;Sometimes our experiences don&#x27;t fit with our understanding of what the Bible teaches. On the one hand, we know that God is sovereign and that he sent Jesus to commission us to pray for and heal the sick. On the other hand, we know from experience that healing does not always occur. Why would God command us to heal the sick and then choose not to back up our act (so to speak) by not healing the person for whom we pray? This can be downright discouraging, as I learned years ago in my own congregation when I began to teach on healing. It was nine months before we saw the first person healed. The temptation was to withdraw from practicing Christ&#x27;s commands or, at the other extreme, to drum up a false bravado to convince God to do what we thought He ought to do.&quot;

<text>Matthew Barnaby (born May 4, 1973) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey right winger. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Buffalo Sabres, Pittsburgh Penguins, Tampa Bay Lightning, New York Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, Chicago Blackhawks, and Dallas Stars.

==Playing career==
Barnaby was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres 83rd overall in the fourth round in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. He was drafted from the QMJHL where he spent four seasons with the Beauport Harfangs, Verdun Collège Français and Victoriaville Tigres, leading the league in penalty minutes in 1992 and 1993. After completing his QMJHL career with the Tigres, Barnaby joined the Sabres for the end of 1992–93 season.

Barnaby, who was considered a pest and agitator during his career, spent the next few seasons playing for the Sabres and AHL affiliate Rochester Americans. Barnaby established a full-time role with the Sabres in the 1995–96 season, recording a career-high in penalty minutes with 335. He was frequently involved in on-ice altercations, and among other incidents he made headlines in 1996, when in a game against the Philadelphia Flyers after a few hits and Barnaby lying on the ice presumably injured, a brawl between the two teams started. With the brawl in full motion, Barnaby jumped to his skates to punish Garth Snow, goaltender of the Flyers, who was poking Barnaby with his stick while the officials weren&#x27;t looking. In 1996–97 Barnaby scored a career-high 19 goals and 43 points in 68 games.

After seven seasons with the Sabres organization during the 1998–99 season, Barnaby was traded by the Sabres to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Stu Barnes on March 11, 1999. One of his most celebrated fights came the following season in 2000 against his former Sabre teammate Rob Ray after dining with Ray the previous night.

Barnaby played in 129 games with the Penguins before he was traded on February 1, 2001, to the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for Wayne Primeau. After struggling to provide an impact to start the 2001–02 season for the Lightning, Barnaby was again traded to the New York Rangers for Zdeno Ciger on December 12, 2001. After going scoreless with Tampa Bay in 29 games Barnaby responded with a resurgence of form with the Rangers, scoring 21 points in 48 games. Barnaby became a fan favourite in the Big Apple and played in 196 games before he was traded to the playoff bound Colorado Avalanche in the 2003–04 season, for David Liffiton and Chris McAllister on March 8, 2004.

On July 2, 2004, Barnaby signed a three-year contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. After the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played his first season with the Hawks in 2005–06. Suffering from the year of hiatus he was subsequently bought-out of his contract following the season.

Barnaby, again a free agent, signed a one-year deal with the Dallas Stars on July 5, 2006. In the 2006–07 season, Barnaby recorded his 300th, and final point, on December 23, 2006 against the Edmonton Oilers. He played only 39 games with the Stars before suffering a season-ending concussion against the Phoenix Coyotes on January 9, 2007. Struggling with the effects of his concussion Barnaby announced his retirement from the NHL in July 2007.

==Broadcasting career==
In September 2007, it was announced via the Sabres website that Barnaby would be given a tryout for replacing Jim Lorentz as color commentator for the Sabres. He served in that capacity for the September 26 pre-season game. The permanent position, however, went to Harry Neale instead. Barnaby also co-hosted &quot;The Enforcers&quot; on Time Warner Cable SportsNet with Rob Ray until joining ESPN as an NHL analyst in late 2008. He was an occasional broadcaster and analyst for the show &quot;NHL on TSN&quot;. On December 5, 2011, ESPN terminated its contract with Barnaby after his arrest on suspicion of DWI earlier in the day.

==Later life==
During the 2013–14 season, Barnaby played Senior AAA hockey with the Dundas Real McCoys of the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Major League Hockey.

In June 2016, Barnaby was named an assistant coach of the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Kitchener Rangers. He was released from the Rangers on October 3, 2017.

Barnaby lives in Ottawa and is a hockey analyst on The Power Play on SiriusXM channel 91. Since 2019, he has hosted a podcast called &quot;Unfiltered with Matthew Barnaby&quot;. Outside of hockey, Barnaby is the co-owner of a company called Hunger Cave. He has also been involved in charitable work raising money for Alzheimer&#x27;s since his grandmother died from the disease.

Barnaby&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Matthew Barnaby: Unfiltered&quot; was released in November 2022.

==Legal problems==
On May 13, 2011, Barnaby was arrested for domestic violence in Amherst, New York. He was accused of causing an estimated $300 in damage after kicking a garage door in an attempt to enter the suburban Buffalo home where his estranged wife and two children lived, Erie County District Attorney Frank Sedita&#x27;s office said. On May 14, 2011, Barnaby pleaded not guilty to felony criminal mischief and was ordered to complete 500 hours of community service to have charges dropped. As part of the ruling, he was also issued a one-year order of protection from his wife. He was barred from taking what was described as any &quot;offensive&quot; action against his wife, and was ordered to avoid contact with his wife&#x27;s boyfriend, the DA&#x27;s office said. Barnaby was also ordered to continue attending anger management counseling. As part of the plea agreement, the misdemeanor charges of criminal mischief and aggravated harassment were to be dropped if he fulfilled the judge&#x27;s order within a year.

On December 5, 2011, Barnaby was arrested near his home in Clarence, New York. Police found him driving a car that had damage to its front end and was missing its front tire. Barnaby failed field sobriety tests and refused a breath test, and he subsequently had his license revoked. On December 13, he pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated, refusing a breath test, driving with unsafe tires, and failing to notify the Department of Motor Vehicles of his address change. Barnaby was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service, attend alcohol abuse counseling, and pay a $1,950 fine.

<doc id="570723" wikidata="Q1146365" url="?curid=570723" title="Barograph">
<text>A barograph is a barometer that records the barometric pressure over time in graphical form. This instrument is also used to make a continuous recording of atmospheric pressure. The pressure-sensitive element, a partially evacuated metal cylinder, is linked to a pen arm in such a way that the vertical displacement of the pen is proportional to the changes in the atmospheric pressure.

==Development==

Alexander Cumming, a watchmaker and mechanic, has a claim to having made the first effective recording barograph in the 1760s using an aneroid cell. Cumming created a series of barometrical clocks, including one for King George III. However, this type of design fell out of favour. Since the amount of movement that can be generated by a single aneroid is minuscule, up to seven aneroids (so called Vidie-cans) are often stacked &quot;in series&quot; to amplify their motion. This type of barograph was invented in 1844 by the Frenchman Lucien Vidi (1805–1866).

In such barographs one or more aneroid cells act through a gear or lever train to drive a recording arm that has at its extreme end either a scribe or a pen. A scribe records on smoked foil while a pen records on paper using ink, held in a nib. The recording material is mounted on a cylindrical drum which is rotated slowly by clockwork. Commonly, the drum makes one revolution per day, per week, or per month and the rotation rate can often be selected by the user.

Various other types of barograph have also been invented. Karl Kreil described a machine in 1843 based on a syphon barometer, where a pencil marked a chart at uniform intervals. Francis Ronalds, the Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, created the first successful barograph utilising photography in 1845. The changing height of the mercury in the barometer was recorded on a continuously moving photosensitive surface. By 1847, a sophisticated temperature-compensation mechanism was also employed. Ronalds’ barograph was utilised by the UK Meteorological Office for many years to assist in weather forecasting and the machines were supplied to numerous observatories around the world.

==Modern use==
Today, traditional recording barographs for meteorological use have commonly been superseded (though not all) by electronic weather instruments that use computer methods to record the barometric pressure. These are not only less expensive than earlier barographs but they may also offer both greater recording length and the ability to perform further data analysis on the captured data including automated use of the data to forecast the weather. Older mechanical barographs are highly prized by collectors as they make good display items, often being made of high quality woods and brass.

The most common weather Barograph found in homes and public buildings these days are the 8-day type. Some important manufacturers of barographs are Negretti and Zambra, Short and Mason, and Richard Ferris among others. The late Victorian to early 20th century is generally considered to be the heyday of Barograph manufacture. Many important refinements were made at this time, including improved temperature compensation and modification of the pen arm, to allow less weight to be applied to the paper, allowing better registration of small pressure changes (i.e. less friction on the nib). Marine barographs (used on ships) often include damping. This evens out the motion of the ship so that a more stable reading can be obtained, this can be either oil damping of the mechanism or simple coiled spring feet on the base. But, newer solid state, digital barographs eliminate this issue altogether, since they use no moving parts.

==Use in aviation==

As atmospheric pressure responds in a predictable manner to changes in altitude, barographs may be used to record elevation changes during an aircraft flight. Barographs were required by the FAI to record certain tasks and record attempts associated with sailplanes. A continuously varying trace indicated that the sailplane had not landed during a task, while measurements from a calibrated trace could be used to establish the completion of altitude tasks or the setting of records. Examples of FAI approved sailplane barographs included the Replogle mechanical drum barograph and the EW electronic barograph (which may be used in conjunction with GPS). Mechanical barographs are not commonly used for flight documentation now, having been displaced by GNSS flight recorders.

==Three-day barograph==

On the top right of the picture of the three-day barograph can be seen a silver knurled knob. This is to adjust the barograph so that it correctly reflects the station pressure. Barely visible below the knob is a small silver plunger. This is pressed every three hours to leave a time mark on the paper.

The line between two of these marks is called the &#x27;characteristic of barometric tendency&#x27; and is used by weather forecasters. The observer would first note if the pressure was lower or higher than three hours prior. Next, a code number would be chosen that best represents the three-hour trace. There are nine possible choices (0 to 8) and no single code has preference over another. In the case of the graph on the barograph, one of two codes could be picked. An 8 (steady then decreasing) or 6 (decreasing then steady). The observer should pick the 6 because it represents the last part of the trace and is thus most representative of the pressure change.

In the bottom centre is the aneroid (large circular silver object). As the pressure increases, the aneroid is pushed down causing the arm to move up and leave a trace on the paper. As the pressure decreases, the spring lifts the aneroid and the arm moves down.

After three days the drum to which the graph is attached is removed. At this point the clockwork motor is wound and if necessary corrections can be made to increase or decrease the speed and new chart is attached.

<doc id="570724" wikidata="Q632873" url="?curid=570724" title="Test for Echo">
<text>Test for Echo is the sixteenth studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released on September 10, 1996, by Anthem Records. It was the final Rush album to be co-produced by Peter Collins. The band supported the album with a world tour in 1996 and 1997, after which they went on a five-year hiatus following the deaths of drummer Neil Peart&#x27;s daughter and wife, and would not record again until 2001.

The title track reached No. 1 on the mainstream rock chart. The song &quot;Driven&quot; became a bass showcase for Geddy Lee during live performances, while &quot;Resist&quot; was rearranged as an acoustic song on the &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; and &quot;R30&quot; tours. The band did not perform any tracks from the album on subsequent tours. &quot;Test for Echo&quot; was remastered and reissued twice: in 2004 as a continuation of &quot;The Rush Remasters&quot; set and in 2013 as a part of the box set &quot;The Studio Albums 1989–2007&quot;. In 2015, it was reissued after being remastered by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios following a direct approach by Rush to remaster their entire back catalogue.

==Background and pre-production==
In May 1994, Rush finished their Counterparts Tour of the United States and Canada in support of the band&#x27;s 15th album &quot;Counterparts&quot; (1993). The group then took a usual break in activity, but this went on to last 18 months as bass guitarist and vocalist Geddy Lee wanted to be at home for the first year of his daughter&#x27;s life. With their free time, guitarist Alex Lifeson recorded his first solo album &quot;Victor&quot; and drummer/lyricist Neil Peart released a Buddy Rich tribute album &quot;Burning for Buddy&quot; and spent time on his technique, receiving formal instruction from the jazz drummer Freddie Gruber. For the majority of the album, Peart plays with a traditional grip.

In October 1995, the band decided to start work on the next Rush album and, as with their previous three albums, retreated to Chalet Studios in Claremont, Ontario, to write and rehearse. Having been together for more than 20 years at this point, Lifeson questioned if &quot;Test for Echo&quot; was to be Rush&#x27;s last album and whether they were to tour it at all. He changed his mind when it was finished as the group was already in talks about the next album and said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got a lot of stuff in us yet.&quot; The first sessions were difficult for him, having had full control of &quot;Victor&quot; and the &quot;same old&quot; discussions with Lee as to what direction the new Rush album would be prior to writing. &quot;Once I exorcised those ghosts, the following week we wrote five songs. We dove into it and it was very, very positive from then on&quot;. The band put up inspirational slogans on the studio wall, including &quot;Individually we are a ass, together we are a genius&quot; and &quot;If you want something done right, just forget it&quot;. Lee and Lifeson completed almost six songs before they presented any of their work to Peart as they did not want to interrupt the flow of their productive writing. They had reserved the studio for around ten weeks, but the productive sessions resulted in the writing finishing three weeks early. Lifeson said the group were in particularly good spirits throughout the album&#x27;s production and put it down to the break they had taken.

The band adopted its usual method of Lee and Lifeson working on the music with Peart working alone on the lyrics, but the music was written in a different way than before. In the past, the writing had Lee and Lifeson form songs by matching pieces of music to verses and choruses as they went and all three would listen to what was put down and exchange ideas to develop them further. This time, lyrics were matched with suitable sections of music, after which they were recorded and Lee and Lifeson would work on something else. As Peart wrote: &quot;They didn&#x27;t want to get bogged down in the &#x27;jigsaw puzzle&#x27; of assembling whole songs, but rather keep the momentum going with a flow of fresh ideas.&quot; After a collection of songs were worked out, the group started to refine their individual parts. In November 1995, the group were faced with heavy snow at Chalet Studios which led into the North American blizzard of 1996 in early January. The snow continued through the recording of the album, which inspired the album&#x27;s artwork.

Almost all of the tracks were written, arranged and put onto a demo tape by December 1995, and the band was then joined by Peter Collins who they chose to resume his role as their co-producer. Collins was their co-producer on &quot;Power Windows&quot; (1985), &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; (1987), and &quot;Counterparts&quot; and offered what Peart described as &quot;small-but-critical improvements&quot; to what they had already recorded. The album continued to display the group&#x27;s change in sound, which had started on &quot;Presto&quot; (1989), towards guitar-oriented music and the reduction of keyboards.

==Recording==
The album was recorded from January to March 1996 at Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York. The studio was chosen because the band wanted to capture &quot;more size&quot; from Peart&#x27;s drums and the facility was more suited to his kit. Additional recording took place at Reaction Studios in Toronto, where it snowed for 40 consecutive days. &quot;Test for Echo&quot; was the first time Rush worked with American engineers and mixers, having only worked with English or Australian personnel before. They chose the recording engineer Clif Norrell, a longtime fan of the band who once performed Rush cover songs in his own group.

The album was mixed in April 1996 by Andy Wallace at McClear Place in Toronto. The group made a conscious decision not to enter the studio until Wallace had prepared a mix for them to comment on. Lifeson said, &quot;We&#x27;d hear completely different takes on these songs that we&#x27;d lived with for six or seven months. [...] There were things that we really wouldn&#x27;t have thought of, and that was really the whole point of him being there&quot;. Upon release, Lifeson rated &quot;Test for Echo&quot; as one of Rush&#x27;s best albums.

==Songs==
&quot;Test for Echo&quot; features lyrical contributions from Pye Dubois who had also written lyrics for three Rush songs prior. Lee said the words reflect the group&#x27;s current situation at the time. Lifeson plays a Les Paul Custom guitar and described the song as &quot;pure Rush&quot;.

&quot;Driven&quot; was written entirely on Lee&#x27;s bass guitar and features three separate bass tracks. Lifeson said that Peart played &quot;a little bit back on the beat&quot; which gave the song a &quot;heavier character&quot; and caused Lee and himself to adjust their parts to fit his drums.

&quot;Half the World&quot; features Lifeson playing a 10-string mandola which he had played to get a feel for the instrument, but found it changed the song&#x27;s personality completely. He presented it to Lee who expressed initial doubts as it displayed an unusual texture, but grew to like it.

&quot;Time and Motion&quot; originated from a set of lyrics that Peart had written, after which Lee and Lifeson worked on music for it which developed quickly. They wanted to dramatise the first lyrical phrase by incorporating major chords, but Lee said a first version of the track was put together some years prior, but never used.

Lee described &quot;Dog Years&quot; as &quot;a bit punky&quot;.

&quot;Limbo&quot; is an instrumental track that was pieced together from different bits of ideas that the group had sketched out but remained unused.

Lifeson picked &quot;Resist&quot; as one of his favourite tracks, and among the best Rush had ever recorded.

==Artwork==
The cover displays an inuksuk, native to Canada. Created by the Inuit, an inuksuk is a stone figure in the shape of a human used to mark a food cache, hunting ground or a place where someone lost their life.

==Release==
The album was premiered in its entirety during a two-hour syndicated radio special on WRCX in Chicago, on September 5, 1996.

==Reception==
The AllMusic reviewer, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, gave &quot;Test for Echo&quot; three out of five stars, saying that Rush has &quot;rarely played better in the past ten years than they have on &quot;Test for Echo&quot;&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; argued, &quot;the buffed guitar and synthesizer contours of &quot;Test for Echo&quot; are welcome relief from the bland din of modern-rock celebrities like Dishwalla.&quot;

<text>Jigme Wangchuck (, ; 1905 – 30 March 1952) was the (Dzongkha འབྲུག་རྒྱལ་གཉིས་པ) 2nd Druk Gyalpo or king of Bhutan from 26 August 1926, until his death. He pursued legal and infrastructural reform during his reign. Bhutan continued to maintain almost complete isolation from the outside world during this period; its only foreign relations were with the British Raj in India, under which Bhutan was a protected state. He was succeeded by his son, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck.

==Early life==
Jigme Wangchuck was born in 1905, at the Thinley Rabten Palace in Wangdue Phodrang District. He received his education at Wangduechhoeling Palace, where he learned English and Hindi and received a religious education. As the first son of Ugyen Wangchuck, Jigme was expected to succeed his father; accordingly, he was given the title Penlop of Trongsa in 1923.

==Reign==
Jigme Wangchuck ascended to the throne in 1926, after the death of Ugyen Wangchuck; he received his formal coronation in Punakha on March 14, 1927. He primarily focused his energies on internal construction and infrastructure projects: for instance, Jigme oversaw the renovation of dzongs and monasteries in eastern Bhutan, and founded and renovated several schools in the country. He also built several royal residences, including the Kuenga Rabten winter palace in Trongsa and additional residences at Samdrupcholing and Domkhar. Jigme was interested in other infrastructural projects, such as improving roads and modernizing medical facilities, but was unable to pursue those projects due to a lack of revenue. Jigme also paid close attention to the administration of Bhutan&#x27;s laws. He discouraged capital punishment for all crimes besides murder, reduced the judicial fees on the citizenry, and allowed citizens to call on him to appeal the judgments of lower officials.

Jigme&#x27;s foreign policy was primarily isolationist, though he followed his father in maintaining friendly relations with the British Raj. When World War II broke out, Jigme sent 100,000 rupees to the Raj as a gesture of goodwill. In return, the Raj protected Bhutan&#x27;s isolation by preventing Westerners from visiting the country. After India became independent, Jigme sent a delegation to initiate diplomatic relations between India and Bhutan; this meeting led to the 1949 friendship treaty between the two nations, in which Bhutan agreed to let India &quot;guide&quot; its foreign policy. This treaty also saw India paying an annual subsidy to Bhutan and handing over 32 square miles of land in Dewangiri.

Early in 1952, Jigme fell ill, and witnessed omens that convinced him he would die. Consequently, he resolved to spend his last days practicing archery, which was one of his favorite pastimes; however, his condition deteriorated during this time, and after ten days he had become too sick to continue with archery. He retired to the Kuenga Rabten Palace, where he died on March 30.

==Children==
The Second King, Jigme Wangchuck, had five children with his two cross cousins, &quot;Ashi&quot; Phuntsho Choden and her sister, &quot;Ashi&quot; Pema Dechen:

* The Third King (Druk Gyalpo) Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (by his first wife). 
* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Choki Wangmo Wangchuck (by his second wife).
* Prince (Druk Gyalsey) Namgyel Wangchuck, 26th &quot;Penlop&quot; of Paro (by his second wife).
* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Deki Yangzom Wangchuck (by his second wife).
* Princess (Druk Gyalsem) Pema Choden Wangchuck (by his second wife).

Princess Choki Wangmo Wangchuck had two daughters, &quot;Ashi&quot; Deki Choden and &quot;Ashi&quot; Sonam Yulgyal.

Princess Pema Choden Wangchuck had four children; &quot;Ashi&quot; Namden, &quot;Dasho&quot; Namgyel Dawa (Tulku Namgyel Rinpoche), &quot;Dasho&quot; Wangchen Dawa (Kathok Situ Rinpoche) and &quot;Dasho&quot; Leon Rabten.

Princess Deki Yangzom Wangchuck had six children; &quot;Ashi&quot; Lhazen Nizal Rica, &quot;Dasho&quot; Jigme Namgyal, &quot;Dasho&quot; Wangchuck Dorji Namgyal, &quot;Ashi&quot; Yiwang Pindarica, &quot;Ashi&quot; Namzay Kumutha and the late &quot;Ashi&quot; Dechen.

==Honours==
=== National honours ===
** Maharaja Ugyen Wangchuck Medal 1st class in gold (17/11/1909).

=== Foreign honours ===
** Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE - 03/06/1930).

<doc id="570743" wikidata="Q1116772" url="?curid=570743" title="Down to Earth (2001 film)">
<text>Down to Earth is a 2001 American fantasy comedy film directed by Chris and Paul Weitz and written by Chris Rock, Lance Crouther, Ali LeRoi and Louis C.K. It is a remake of the 1978 film &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, which is based on the 1938 stage play of the same name by Harry Segall. The film stars Chris Rock as Lance Barton, a comedian who is killed before his time on Earth is through. He is given another chance to continue his life, but in the body of a rich middle-aged white man.

The film was released on February 16, 2001. It received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $71 million.

==Plot==
Lance Barton is a struggling comedian who is quite funny and confident in his personality, but is unable to bring his talent across in front of an audience. After being booed off stage one night, he hears about an opportunity from his manager, Whitney Daniels at the Apollo Theater, which is having a farewell show due to its imminent closing. He is hoping to get a chance to prove himself in front of a real audience, when on his way home riding a bike, Lance is distracted by Sontee Jenkins. He is hit by a truck and is instantly killed.

Lance is brought up to Heaven, where he meets the angels, King and Keyes, who reveal that Lance has been taken before his time, and though his body had been destroyed in the collision, they can help Lance return to Earth. After sorting through many bodies, they find Charles Wellington III, an extremely rich businessman freshly drowned in his tub by his wife and assistant, Winston Sklar. Lance is reluctant until he discovers that Sontee, the woman he saw before his death, is protesting Charles by handcuffing herself to a coffee table in his penthouse, demanding Charles&#x27; presence. Seeing this as a chance to get to know her, Lance makes a deal with King to temporarily lend Charles&#x27; body until a more suitable body is found. Soon after, Charles returns from death, but with the witty soul of Lance inside him. Everyone except for the angels and him sees him as the middle-aged, rich, white Charles.

Although Charles was unpopular in the past, the public and those closest to Charles start to notice a change in his personality. He transforms from a snobbish billionaire to a philanthropist, including giving the maid Wanda a raise. Despite recent events, Lance continues to follow his comedy dreams through Charles, contacting his old manager Whitney and convincing him that he is Lance reincarnated. Through many humorous moments and issues, he gets Sontee to fall in love with him.

All too soon, Charles is murdered by a hired assassin. Fulfilling the deal Lance and King set up earlier, King and Keyes then send Lance to return yet again to Earth as Joe Guy, a great comedian and more acceptable candidate, who will die in a car accident. Joe returns from this accident unscathed, now with Lance&#x27;s soul.

After pulling off a successful performance at the Apollo and reconnecting with Whitney, King and Keyes inform Lance that after their current conversation, he will not remember them or his past lives, but his personality will remain. After they leave, he reconnects with Whitney again, and proceeds to get Sontee to fall in love with him again, after meeting her in the theater for the first time as Joe Guy.

<text>Tsarevich (, ) was a title given to the sons of tsars. The female equivalent was &quot;tsarevna&quot;.

Under the 1797 Pauline house laws, the title was discontinued and replaced with &quot;tsesarevich&quot; for the heir apparent alone. His younger brothers were given the title of &quot;veliky knyaz&quot;, translated as &quot;grand prince&quot; or, more commonly, as &quot;grand duke&quot;.

Historically, the term was also applied to descendants of the khans (tsars) of Kazan, Kasimov, and Siberia after these khanates had been conquered by Russia. The descendants of the deposed royal families of Georgia or the &quot;batonishvili&quot; were given the titles of tsarevich until 1833, when they were demoted to &quot;knyaz&quot; after a failed coup to restore the Georgian monarchy.

<text>A laboratory information management system (LIMS), sometimes referred to as a laboratory information system (LIS) or laboratory management system (LMS), is a software-based solution with features that support a modern laboratory&#x27;s operations. Key features include—but are not limited to—workflow and data tracking support, flexible architecture, and data exchange interfaces, which fully &quot;support its use in regulated environments&quot;. The features and uses of a LIMS have evolved over the years from simple sample tracking to an enterprise resource planning tool that manages multiple aspects of laboratory informatics.

There is no useful definition of the term &quot;LIMS&quot; as it is used to encompass a number of different laboratory informatics components. The spread and depth of these components is highly dependent on the LIMS implementation itself. All LIMSs have a workflow component and some summary data management facilities but beyond that there are significant differences in functionality.

Historically the LIMyS, LIS, and process development execution system (PDES) have all performed similar functions. The term &quot;LIMS&quot; has tended to refer to informatics systems targeted for environmental, research, or commercial analysis such as pharmaceutical or petrochemical work. &quot;LIS&quot; has tended to refer to laboratory informatics systems in the forensics and clinical markets, which often required special case management tools. &quot;PDES&quot; has generally applied to a wider scope, including, for example, virtual manufacturing techniques, while not necessarily integrating with laboratory equipment.

In recent times LIMS functionality has spread even further beyond its original purpose of sample management. Assay data management, data mining, data analysis, and electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) integration have been added to many LIMS, enabling the realization of translational medicine completely within a single software solution. Additionally, the distinction between LIMS and LIS has blurred, as many LIMS now also fully support comprehensive case-centric clinical data.

==History==
Up until the late 1970s, the management of laboratory samples and the associated analysis and reporting were time-consuming manual processes often riddled with transcription errors. This gave some organizations impetus to streamline the collection of data and how it was reported. Custom in-house solutions were developed by a few individual laboratories, while some enterprising entities sought to develop commercial reporting solutions in the form of special instrument-based systems.

In 1982 the first generation of LIMS was introduced in the form of a centralized minicomputer, which offered automated reporting tools. As the interest in these early LIMS grew, industry leaders like Gerst Gibbon of the Federal Energy Technology Center in Pittsburgh began planting the seeds through LIMS-related conferences. By 1988 the second-generation commercial offerings were tapping into relational databases to expand LIMS into more application-specific territory, and International LIMS Conferences were in full swing. As personal computers became more powerful and prominent, a third generation of LIMS emerged in the early 1990s. These new LIMS took advantage of client/server architecture, allowing laboratories to implement better data processing and exchanges.

By 1995 the client/server tools allowed the processing of data anywhere on the network. Web-enabled LIMS were introduced the following year, enabling researchers to extend operations outside the laboratory. From 1996 to 2002 additional functionality was included, from wireless networking and georeferencing of samples, to the adoption of XML standards and Internet purchasing.

As of 2012, some LIMS have added additional characteristics such as clinical functionality, electronic laboratory notebook (ELN) functionality, as well a rise in the software as a service (SaaS) distribution model.

==Technology==

===Operations===

The LIMS is an evolving concept, with new features and functionality being added often. As laboratory demands change and technological progress continues, the functions of a LIMS will likely also change. Despite these changes, a LIMS tends to have a base set of functionality that defines it. That functionality can roughly be divided into five laboratory processing phases, with numerous software functions falling under each:
(1) the reception and log in of a sample and its associated customer data, 
(2) the assignment, scheduling, and tracking of the sample and the associated analytical workload, 
(3) the processing and quality control associated with the sample and the utilized equipment and inventory, 
(4) the storage of data associated with the sample analysis, 
(5) the inspection, approval, and compilation of the sample data for reporting and/or further analysis.

There are several pieces of core functionality associated with these laboratory processing phases that tend to appear in most LIMS:

====Sample management====
The core function of LIMS has traditionally been the management of samples. This typically is initiated when a sample is received in the laboratory, at which point the sample will be registered in the LIMS. Some LIMS will allow the customer to place an &quot;order&quot; for a sample directly to the LIMS at which point the sample is generated in an &quot;unreceived&quot; state. The processing could then include a step where the sample container is registered and sent to the customer for the sample to be taken and then returned to the lab. The registration process may involve accessioning the sample and producing barcodes to affix to the sample container. Various other parameters such as clinical or phenotypic information corresponding with the sample are also often recorded. The LIMS then tracks chain of custody as well as sample location. Location tracking usually involves assigning the sample to a particular freezer location, often down to the granular level of shelf, rack, box, row, and column. Other event tracking such as freeze and thaw cycles that a sample undergoes in the laboratory may be required.

Modern LIMS have implemented extensive configurability as each laboratory&#x27;s needs for tracking additional data points can vary widely. LIMS vendors cannot typically make assumptions about what these data tracking needs are, and therefore vendors must create LIMS that are adaptable to individual environments. LIMS users may also have regulatory concerns to comply with such as CLIA, HIPAA, GLP, and FDA specifications, affecting certain aspects of sample management in a LIMS solution. One key to compliance with many of these standards is audit logging of all changes to LIMS data, and in some cases a full electronic signature system is required for rigorous tracking of field-level changes to LIMS data.

====Instrument and application integration====

Modern LIMS offer an increasing amount of integration with laboratory instruments and applications. A LIMS may create control files that are &quot;fed&quot; into the instrument and direct its operation on some physical item such as a sample tube or sample plate. The LIMS may then import instrument results files to extract data for quality control assessment of the operation on the sample. Access to the instrument data can sometimes be regulated based on chain of custody assignments or other security features if need be.

Modern LIMS products now also allow for the import and management of raw assay data results. Modern targeted assays such as qPCR and deep sequencing can produce tens of thousands of data points per sample. Furthermore, in the case of drug and diagnostic development as many as 12 or more assays may be run for each sample. In order to track this data, a LIMS solution needs to be adaptable to many different assay formats at both the data layer and import creation layer, while maintaining a high level of overall performance. Some LIMS products address this by simply attaching assay data as BLOBs to samples, but this limits the utility of that data in data mining and downstream analysis.

====Electronic data exchange====

The exponentially growing volume of data created in laboratories, coupled with increased business demands and focus on profitability, have pushed LIMS vendors to increase attention to how their LIMS handles electronic data exchanges. Attention must be paid to how an instrument&#x27;s input and output data is managed, how remote sample collection data is imported and exported, and how mobile technology integrates with the LIMS. The successful transfer of data files in spreadsheets and other formats is a pivotal aspect of the modern LIMS. In fact, the transition &quot;from proprietary databases to standardized database management systems such as MySQL&quot; has arguably had one of the biggest impacts on how data is managed and exchanged in laboratories. In addition to mobile and database electronic data exchange, many LIMS support real-time data exchange with Electronic Health Records used in core hospital or clinic operations.

====Additional functions====

Aside from the key functions of sample management, instrument and application integration, and electronic data exchange, there are numerous additional operations that can be managed in a LIMS. This includes but is not limited to:

; Audit management
: Fully track and maintain an audit trail
; Barcode handling
: Assign one or more data points to a barcode format; read and extract information from a barcode
; Chain of custody
: Assign roles and groups that dictate access to specific data records and who is managing them
; Compliance
: Follow regulatory standards that affect the laboratory
; Customer relationship management
: Handle the demographic information and communications for associated clients
; Document management
: Process and convert data to certain formats; manage how documents are distributed and accessed
; Instrument calibration and maintenance
: Schedule important maintenance and calibration of lab instruments and keep detailed records of such activities
; Inventory and equipment management
: Measure and record inventories of vital supplies and laboratory equipment
; Manual and electronic data entry
: Provide fast and reliable interfaces for data to be entered by a human or electronic component
; Method management
: Provide one location for all laboratory process and procedure (P&amp;P) and methodology to be housed and managed as well as connecting each sample handling step with current instructions for performing the operation
; Personnel and workload management
: Organize work schedules, workload assignments, employee demographic information, training, and financial information
; Quality assurance and control
: Gauge and control sample quality, corrective and preventive action (CAPA), data entry standards, and workflow
; Reports
: Create and schedule reports in a specific format; schedule and distribute reports to designated parties
; Time tracking
: Calculate and maintain processing and handling times on chemical reactions, workflows, and more
; Traceability
: Show audit trail and/or chain of custody of a sample
; Workflows
: Track a sample, a batch of samples, or a &quot;lot&quot; of batches through its lifecycle

===Client-side options===

A LIMS has utilized many architectures and distribution models over the years. As technology has changed, how a LIMS is installed, managed, and utilized has also changed with it. The following represents architectures which have been utilized at one point or another.

====Thick-client====
A thick-client LIMS is a more traditional client/server architecture, with some of the system residing on the computer or workstation of the user (the client) and the rest on the server. The LIMS software is installed on the client computer, which does all of the data processing. Later it passes information to the server, which has the primary purpose of data storage. Most changes, upgrades, and other modifications will happen on the client side.

This was one of the first architectures implemented into a LIMS, having the advantage of providing higher processing speeds (because processing is done on the client and not the server). Additionally, thick-client systems have also provided more interactivity and customization, though often at a greater learning curve. The disadvantages of client-side LIMS include the need for more robust client computers and more time-consuming upgrades, as well as a lack of base functionality through a web browser. The thick-client LIMS can become web-enabled through an add-on component.

Although there is a claim of improved security through the use of a thick-client LIMS, this is based on the misconception that &quot;only users with the client application installed on their PC can access server side information&quot;. This secrecy-of-design reliance is known as security through obscurity and ignores an adversary&#x27;s ability to mimic client-server interaction through, for example, reverse engineering, network traffic interception, or simply purchasing a thick-client license. Such a view is in contradiction of the &quot;Open Design&quot; principle of the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s &quot;Guide to General Server Security&quot; which states that &quot;system security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components&quot;, which can be considered as a reiteration of Kerckhoffs&#x27;s principle.

====Thin-client====

A thin-client LIMS is a more modern architecture which offers full application functionality accessed through a device&#x27;s web browser. The actual LIMS software resides on a server (host) which feeds and processes information without saving it to the user&#x27;s hard disk. Any necessary changes, upgrades, and other modifications are handled by the entity hosting the server-side LIMS software, meaning all end-users see all changes made. To this end, a true thin-client LIMS will leave no &quot;footprint&quot; on the client&#x27;s computer, and only the integrity of the web browser need be maintained by the user. The advantages of this system include significantly lower cost of ownership and fewer network and client-side maintenance expenses. However, this architecture has the disadvantage of requiring real-time server access, a need for increased network throughput, and slightly less functionality. A sort of hybrid architecture that incorporates the features of thin-client browser usage with a thick client installation exists in the form of a web-based LIMS.

Some LIMS vendors are beginning to rent hosted, thin-client solutions as &quot;software as a service&quot; (SaaS). These solutions tend to be less configurable than on-premises solutions and are therefore considered for less demanding implementations such as laboratories with few users and limited sample processing volumes.

Another implementation of the thin client architecture is the maintenance, warranty, and support (MSW) agreement. Pricing levels are typically based on a percentage of the license fee, with a standard level of service for 10 concurrent users being approximately 10 hours of support and additional customer service, at a roughly $200 per hour rate. Though some may choose to opt out of an MSW after the first year, it is often more economical to continue the plan in order to receive updates to the LIMS, giving it a longer life span in the laboratory.

====Web-enabled====
A web-enabled LIMS architecture is essentially a thick-client architecture with an added web browser component. In this setup, the client-side software has additional functionality that allows users to interface with the software through their device&#x27;s browser. This functionality is typically limited only to certain functions of the web client. The primary advantage of a web-enabled LIMS is the end-user can access data both on the client side and the server side of the configuration. As in a thick-client architecture, updates in the software must be propagated to every client machine. However, the added disadvantages of requiring always-on access to the host server and the need for cross-platform functionality mean that additional overhead costs may arise.

==== Web-based ====
A web-based LIMS architecture is a hybrid of the thick- and thin-client architectures. While much of the client-side work is done through a web browser, the LIMS may also require the support of desktop software installed on the client device. The end result is a process that is apparent to the end-user through a web browser, but perhaps not so apparent as it runs thick-client-like processing in the background. In this case, web-based architecture has the advantage of providing more functionality through a more friendly web interface. The disadvantages of this setup are more sunk costs in system administration and reduced functionality on mobile platforms.

=== Configurability ===
LIMS implementations are notorious for often being lengthy and costly. This is partly due to the diversity of requirements within each lab, but also to the inflexible nature of most LIMS products for adapting to these widely varying requirements. Newer LIMS solutions are beginning to emerge that take advantage of modern techniques in software design that are inherently more configurable and adaptable — particularly at the data layer — than prior solutions. This means not only that implementations are much faster, but also that the costs are lower and the risk of obsolescence is minimized.

==Distinction between a LIMS and a LIS==
Until recently, the LIMS and Laboratory Information System (LIS) have exhibited a few key differences, making them noticeably separate entities.

A LIMS traditionally has been designed to process and report data related to batches of samples from biology labs, water treatment facilities, drug trials, and other entities that handle complex batches of data. A LIS has been designed primarily for processing and reporting data related to individual patients in a clinical setting.

A LIMS may need to satisfy good manufacturing practice (GMP) and meet the reporting and audit needs of the regulatory bodies and research scientists in many different industries. A LIS, however, must satisfy the reporting and auditing needs of health service agencies e.g. the hospital accreditation agency, HIPAA in the US, or other clinical medical practitioners.

A LIMS is most competitive in group-centric settings (dealing with &quot;batches&quot; and &quot;samples&quot;) that often deal with mostly anonymous research-specific laboratory data, whereas a LIS is usually most competitive in patient-centric settings (dealing with &quot;subjects&quot; and &quot;specimens&quot;) and clinical labs. An LIS is regulated as a medical device by the FDA, and the companies that produce the software are therefore liable for defects. Due to this, a LIS can not be customized by the client.

==Standards==
A LIMS covers standards such as 21 CFR Part 11 from the Food and Drug Administration (United States), ISO/IEC 17025, 
ISO 15189, ISO 20387, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), HACCP, and ISBER Best Practices.

<doc id="570759" wikidata="Q3630345" url="?curid=570759" title="Gurcharan Singh Tohra">
<text>Panth Rattan Shiri Gurcharan Singh Tohra (24 September 1924 – 1 April 2004) was a president of Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), a Sikh body in charge of controlling Gurdwara (Sikh places of worship). He died of a heart attack in New Delhi on 1 April 2004 at the age of 79. He remained the head of the SGPC for a record 27 years, and was one of the most influential and controversial Sikh leaders of the 20th century.

He was born in the village of Tohra in Patiala District, to Sikh family of Tiwana Jatts.

Indian President A. P. J. Abdul Kalam described the Sikh leader as a &quot;prominent political and social leader who was well known for his work during his many years in public life&quot;.

==Sobriquets==
During his lifetime and after his death, Gurcharan Singh Tohra was addressed by many sobriquets. It included Pope of the Sikhs, Pearl of the Panth, Kingmaker, Pope, Messiah, Reformist, Conformist, Forever-Dissenter, Wily Fox, Wily Politician, and Machiavelli. Followers often addressed him as Pardhanji (President) or Jathedar.

==Punjab politics==

He was born in September 1924 in the Punjabi village of Tohra. Even before India&#x27;s partition, he was an active member of the Akali movement. He became General Secretary of the Patiala unit of the Shiromani Akali Dal in 1947.

Tohra, a graduate in Punjabi from Lahore University, worked at the grassroots level for the next two decades and came into contact with Communists, including CPI-M leader Harkishan Singh Surjeet though he did not become one himself.

Known as a hardliner, Tohra had carved out for himself the image of a non-conformist with the powers-that-be in Akali politics and had taken frontline SAD leaders Surjit Singh Barnala and Parkash Singh Badal who had headed Akali Dal governments in Punjab in the eighties and nineties. He was known for his own brand of politics.

Tohra was a member of Lok Sabha in 1977–79 though earlier he was elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha five times from Punjab from 1969 to 1976 and re-elected in May 1980, April 1982, April 1998, and March 2004.

He played a huge role in Sikh political affairs in post partition India. Along with Parkash Singh Badal and Jagdev Singh Talwandi, he was regarded as the triumvirate of Sikh politics in Punjab. Unlike the other two, his main domain was the Sikh religious institution, the SGPC. Though he dabbled with electoral politics often, Tohra made his mark in Sikh religious affairs. He is credited with rebuilding the institution of the Akal Takhat.

==Early days==

As an agriculturalist, Tohra was first jailed in 1945 during the Riyasti Praja Mandal Movement in Nabha, in 1950 for formation of popular government in PEPSU. In 1955 and 1960 Tohra was put behind bars in connection with Punjabi Suba agitations, in 1973 in connection with Kisan agitation in Haryana, in 1975, under MISA and under NSA and TADA and religious matters, including Dharam Yudh Morcha and Operation Blue Star (1984).

Tohra became the acting president of SGPC, which manages key Sikh shrines, in 1972 after the death of Sant Chanan Singh and was formally elected its president for the first time in November that year.

Tohra continued to head the SGPC, considered the mini-parliament of the Sikh community, for a record 27 years before he was unceremoniously removed from the key post following a split in SAD in the wake of his revolt against Badal&#x27;s leadership.

Tohra was arrested during the Emergency and was very popular in Punjab until Jarnail Singh Bhindranwala emerged on the scene and militancy took over Sikh politics.

==Operation Bluestar==
During Operation Blue Star in 1984 to clear up Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple) complex from sikh militants, Tohra was the President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee. The army operation happened between 1-6 June 1984. Several Akali Dal leaders were stuck in the temple complex during the operation. Gurcharan Singh Tohra was among the Sikh leaders who gave up and were rescued by Army to from within the Golden Temple. They could only be evacuated in an Armoured personnel carrier (APC) due to fear of firing from the Singhs fighting for their Temple. When the Army officers met him, the first question he wanted to know was if Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was dead or alive.

==Troubled times==

Tohra&#x27;s differences with then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal contributed to the fall of the Akali-Janata coalition in 1980. That began a period of crisis for Tohra as he seemed to favour Bhindranwala&#x27;s ideas which did not sit well with the opposition.

After Operation Blue Star in 1984, Tohra became an embittered man and did not endorse the Punjab accord put forward by the Rajiv Gandhi government to the Akalis for sharing political power with Harchand Singh Longowal. He took another controversial step some time later by having Sikhs demolish the Akal Takht which was rebuilt after Operation Blue Star by pro-government religious leaders. The Takht was rebuilt by the Sikhs over several years. This turned him into the &#x27;bete noire&#x27; not only of the Centre but also of the then Akali government in Punjab headed by Surjit Singh Barnala which had opposed the move.

He was detained under the National Security Act but continued to be elected SGPC chairman for several years in absentia. Throughout this bleak period, Tohra was supported by Badal but in 1999, the two leaders, considered the best of friends, fell out after the SGPC chief pressed for Badal&#x27;s removal as SAD chief.

==Tohra-Badal feud==

The feud of Gurcharan Singh Tohra vs Parkash Singh Badal was described as &quot;Clash of Titans&quot;. 
The origin of Tohra-Badal feud could be traced to the former&#x27;s casual remarks, made in November 1998, suggesting one-man-one-post for Akali Dal leaders. According to historian Dr Harjinder Singh Dilgeer, the personal opponents of Tohra availed this opportunity and provoked Badal to expel the latter from the SGPC and the Akali Dal. At this, Badal had Tohra removed as SGPC chief on 16 March 1999, a few days before the commencement of tercentenary celebrations of the birth of the Khalsa at Anandpur Sahib.

Tohra was then expelled from SAD forcing him to form a new party Sarv Hind Shiromani Akali Dal with five members of Badal&#x27;s cabinet, including Manjit Singh Calcutta, Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, Harmail Singh , Inderjit Singh Zira and Surjit Singh Kohli, Jathedar Sukhdev Singh Bhaur Acting President of SGPC who all resigned in protest against the expulsion.

Badal consolidated his grip on Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of Sikhism, by removing Bhai Ranjit Singh as its top Jathedar in February 1999 and installing his hand-picked Giani Puran Singh. Tohra was also replaced by Bibi Jagir Kaur the first woman president of the SGPC.

Adversity brought Tohra and Badal together again after SAD was routed in the February 2002 assembly elections in Punjab and Tohra&#x27;s SSHAD failed to win even a single seat.

Badal was at the receiving end of Amarinder Singh-headed Congress government&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign as vigilance personnel searched his premises as well as those of his MP son Sukhbir Singh Badal in Punjab and outside.

After this, considering the panthik interests more important the then prominent Sikh leader and scholar Prof. Kirpal Singh Badungar left his seat of SGPC president for Tohra. On 13 June 2003, Badal and Tohra finally buried the hatchet after the latter welcomed the former&#x27;s appearance before the Akal Takht and expressed satisfaction over the mild religious punishment ordered by the Sikh clergy to the former chief minister. Tohra was appointed SGPC President in July 2003 after he accepted Badal&#x27;s pre-eminence in the SAD.

==New party==
After splitting with the Shiromani Akali Dal led by Parkash Singh Badal, Tohra floated his own party called the All India Shiromani Akali Dal (also called the Sarv Hind Shiromani Akali Dal). Five ministers of the ruling government Science and Technology Minister Mahesh Inder Singh Grewal, Higher Education Minister Manjit Singh Calcutta, Public Works Minister Harmel Singh and Ministers Inderjit Singh Zira and Surjit Singh Kohli quit the ruling government and joined Tohra. 
Veteran leader Surjan Singh Thekedar &amp; Acting President of SGPC Jathedar Sukhdev Singh Bhaur also joined Tohra. However, during the 2002 assembly elections, the party did not fare well. The Congress came to power in 2002 and both Badal and Tohra were in the opposition. Later, in 2003, Badal invited Tohra to rejoin the Shiromani Akali Dal.

==Family==
Gurcharan Singh Tohra was married to Joginder Kaur who died at the age of 83 on 26 January 2011. His Nephew Upkar Singh Tohra.

==Tributes==
Despite being in opposite political campus, the national leadership in India paid tributes to Gurcharan Singh Tohra. Although the Bharatiya Janata Party was upset at Tohra&#x27;s remarks comparing the then Prime Minister of India, Atal Bihari Vajpayee with the Indira Gandhi, Vajpayee paid his tributes to Tohra on his death. He described Tohra was a leader with deep saintly traits, &quot;A follower of dictum of simple living and high thinking, Shri Tohra made invaluable contribution to the regeneration of social, political and religious life of Punjab. In his death, the country has lost a popular and inspiring figure,&quot; the Prime Minister said.
Veteran journalist Khushwant Singh stated that Tohra &quot;could have become the uncrowned king of the Sikhs&quot;, but &quot;his vision remained limited to launching morchas and going to jail&quot;.
Though politically ranged against each other, both belong to Patiala then Chief Minister of Punjab, Capt Amarinder Singh stressed the &quot;honest life&quot; of Gurcharan Singh Tohra.

<text>J. Martin Hattersley (November 10, 1932 - June 7, 2020) was a Canadian lawyer and long-time activist of the Canadian social credit movement. Born in Swinton, near Rotherham, Yorkshire, England, Hattersley earned degrees in economics and law from Cambridge University before moving to Alberta in 1956 where he worked as a lawyer. His parents met at a social credit conference in Britain.

From 1962 to 1964, he was director of research of the Social Credit Association of Canada, and personal secretary and speechwriter to Social Credit Party of Canada leader Robert N. Thompson, MP.

Hattersley served as national president of the party in the mid-1970s and ran for the party&#x27;s leadership following the death of Réal Caouette in 1976, placing third. He ran again in 1978 when he was defeated by Lorne Reznowski at the party&#x27;s national leadership convention by a margin of 356 votes to 115. Hattersley had campaigned on a platform of broadening the party&#x27;s base and appealing to a wider spectrum of voters but was unable to overcome Reznowski&#x27;s more doctrinaire approach advocating social credit monetary theory.

After the party&#x27;s remaining five Members of Parliament were defeated in the 1980 general election, he became leader of the party from 1981 to 1983. He resigned after the party voted to reinstatate Jim Keegstra and two others after Hattersley suspended their memberships and tried to expel them because of their anti-Semitic activism, saying &quot;I simply cannot be leader of a party that has people accepted into its ranks that publicly express views of that sort.&quot; Hattersley later claimed that Social Credit&#x27;s association with &quot;that sort of approach . . . prevents other people from taking it seriously.&quot;

He was also interim leader of the Social Credit Party of Alberta from 1985 to 1988, in the wake of the party&#x27;s loss of its only remaining seats in the Alberta legislature and was president emeritus afterwards. As leader he led an attempt to merge several Alberta parties into the Alberta Political Alliance, which proved to be a short-lived coalition of Social Credit, the Western Canada Concept and the Heritage Party, in 1986 but neither the Alliance nor Social Credit were prepared to run candidates in the 1986 Alberta election.

In August 1988, the body of Hattersley&#x27;s 29-year-old daughter, Cathy Greeve, was found in the bathroom at an Edmonton Transit station. She had been robbed and strangled to death. Ronald Nienhuis, on day parole while serving time for armed robbery, was charged and convicted of the crime.

Since his daughter&#x27;s murder, Hattersley has been involved in an Edmonton victim&#x27;s support group and has spoken in prisons on alternatives to violence. He has spoken out in favour of prisoners&#x27; right to vote, telling the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; that &quot;[b]eing allowed to vote means you are being treated as a human being and a citizen and that&#x27;s good from a psychological point of view.&quot; He was given the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee medal for his work in the victim&#x27;s support group. Over the course of his life he served as a Lay Reader and choir director at a number of Anglican churches in Edmonton and Ottawa, and in 1974, was ordained as a `priest in secular employment&#x27;.

He died in Edmonton, Alberta, on June 7, 2020.

<text>Nicholas James Christopher Lowther, 2nd Viscount Ullswater (born 9 January 1942), is a British hereditary peer and former member of the House of Lords who sat as a Conservative. He succeeded his great-grandfather in the viscountcy of Ullswater in 1949, being one of very few peers to have succeeded a great-grandfather in a title.

He served as a whip and a minister under Margaret Thatcher and John Major between 1989 and 1995 culminating in serving as the Minister of State for Housing from 1994 to 1995.

==Early life==
Lowther was the son of John Lowther (1910–1942), and Priscilla Lambert (1917–1945). His father was secretary to HRH The Duke of Kent, who served as best man at their 1937 wedding. His father died alongside the Duke in the Dunbeath air crash.

Lowther was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political career==
Lowther was made a Lord-in-waiting (whip) in January 1989 by Margaret Thatcher before becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Employment in July 1990. He was retained by John Major in that role until 1993, when he became Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms (Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords). He remained in this role for a year. He became Minister of State for Housing at the Department of the Environment (as well as a Privy Counsellor) in 1994, but left the Government in a 1995 reshuffle.

==Princess Margaret==
In 1998, he was appointed Private Secretary to Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and continued in this office until her death in 2002. He was appointed Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order in the special Honours List issued by the Queen after the Princess&#x27;s death.

==Return to politics==
As a member of a Royal Household he could not take part in partisan politics and did not seek to remain in the House of Lords when the House of Lords Act 1999 was passed. But after the death of the Viscount of Oxfuird in January 2003, he won the all-house by-election, enabling him to return to the House of Lords.

On 22 May 2006, Lord Ullswater was nominated for the newly created post of Lord Speaker, and in the election held on 28 June 2006 emerged in third place out of nine candidates. He served as one of the Deputy Speakers in the Lords until May 2020; from June 2020 until May 2021, he served as Deputy Chairman of Committees. His great-grandfather, James Lowther, served as Speaker of the House of Commons 1905–1921.

Ullswater retired from the House of Lords on 20 July 2022.

==Other interests==
Lord Ullswater is the Chairman of Lonsdale Settled Estates Ltd and a Director of Lowther Trustees Limited, both companies that manage the family landholdings in Cumbria.

==Arms==
==Personal life==
Lord Ullswater was an amateur jockey in his youth.

In 1967, he married Susan Weatherby. The couple has two sons and two daughters:
*Hon. Emma Mary Lowther, (born 1968)
*Hon. Clare Priscilla Lowther, (born 1970)
*Hon. Benjamin James Lowther (born 1975)
*Hon. Edward John Lowther (born 1981)

The family lives at Docking in Norfolk.

<text>The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, commonly known as the Hewlett Foundation, is a private foundation, established by Hewlett-Packard cofounder William Redington Hewlett and his wife Flora Lamson Hewlett in 1966. The Hewlett Foundation awards grants to a variety of liberal and progressive causes.

With assets of approximately $14 billion, Hewlett is one of the wealthiest grant makers in the United States. The Foundation has grantmaking programs in education, the environment, global development and population, the performing arts, and philanthropy. The Hewlett Foundation is based in Menlo Park, California.

==History==
Bill and Flora Hewlett consolidated their philanthropic activity into the William R. Hewlett Foundation, which Bill, aged 53, founded in 1966 in their Palo Alto, California, home. Founding board members were Bill, Flora, and the couple&#x27;s oldest son, Walter Hewlett. The years 1966–1972 were referred to as &quot;the living room years&quot;. Flora Hewlett served as a board member and Bill Hewlett was an active part of the foundation until his death. Bill Hewlett sought to fund established organizations operating in his fields of interest. In its first ten years, the foundation awarded close to $15.3 million to organizations involved in education, population, performing arts, environment, health, and social services.

In 1972, the foundation&#x27;s board of directors was expanded with the addition of William A. Hewlett and James S. Hewlett. In 1974, the foundation hired its first executive director, John May, who was also the executive of the San Francisco Foundation. Following Flora Hewlett&#x27;s death in 1977, and in her memory, the foundation&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation&quot;. Shortly after, the foundation appointed former University of California Chancellor Roger W. Heyns as president, with Bill Hewlett becoming the board chair. The board was expanded with the addition of Eleanor Hewlett Gilmon and Mary Hewlett Jaffe, daughters of Bill and Flora. Since 1981, the majority of the foundation&#x27;s board has been composed of non-family members.

The foundation has received credit for its work in the areas of conflict resolution, education, environmental protection, performing arts, and as a supporter of organizations in the Bay Area.

In 1993, with the appointment of former University of California President David P. Gardner, who succeeded Roger Heyns who retired after 15 years, the foundation&#x27;s focus widened. The foundation expanded its funding of environmental causes, formerly restricted to California, to all over the Western United States and Canada. The foundation also began focusing on K-12 education reforms. Gardner introduced a new program supporting relations between the US and Latin America. Gardner served for six years.

During Gardner&#x27;s tenure, the foundation introduced the limitation of terms served as program officers with terms expiring after six years, followed by an extension of three years with board approval. In 2005, this term limit was extended to eight years.

In January 2000, Paul Brest, the former dean of Stanford Law School, was appointed as the new president of the foundation. He served for 12 years. On January 12, 2001, Bill Hewlett, aged 87 years, died from heart failure. During Brest&#x27;s time as president, the foundation started to focus on awarding grants for efforts curbing global warming and the expansion of the use of open educational resources. During this time, the foundation also relocated to Menlo Park, California.

Larry Kramer, also a former dean of Stanford Law School, became the foundation&#x27;s president in 2012. He introduced new initiatives addressing political polarization as well as cybersecurity. Kramer stepped down in December 2023.

Stephen C. Neal, who had been serving as a board member since 2006, was appointed as and succeeded Walter Hewlett as board chair.

===Foundation assets and endowment===
During its first ten years, the foundation awarded grants of approximately $15.3 million.

The foundation&#x27;s endowment kept growing considerably, with Flora Hewlett&#x27;s estate bolstering it to more than $300 million in 1981 and the foundation&#x27;s assets reaching more than $800 million by the 1990s, an increase of more than 30 times.

Between 1993 and 1999, under the leadership of David P. Gardner, the foundation&#x27;s assets grew to more than $2 billion and grants increased from $35 million in 1993 to $84 million in 1998.

In 2000, the foundation&#x27;s assets had grown to $3.93 billion. This increased further with the transfer of Bill Hewlett&#x27;s estate bringing the assets up to $8.52 billion and catapulting the foundation into the fifth place of private foundations in America.

According to the OECD, the Hewlett Foundation provided USD 123.3 million for development in 2019, all in the form of grants.

==Programs and grants==

===Education===
In 2001, the foundation gave $400 million to Stanford University for humanities, sciences, and undergraduate education. At the time, the gift was the largest on record to a university. In 2007, the Hewlett Foundation made a $113 million donation to the University of California, Berkeley to create 100 new endowed professorships and provide financial help for graduate students.

In May 2010, the Hewlett Foundation announced its strategy of &quot;Deeper Learning&quot;, which is a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions.

Hewlett and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation helped to develop the field of OpenCourseWare.
Hewlett seeded the Creative Commons project with $1 million.

===Climate===
In 2008, the foundation awarded the ClimateWorks Foundation approximately $460,800,000. Hewlett funded restoration of the Bay Area Salt Ponds and conservation of the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada.

Hewlett&#x27;s Environment Program makes grants to support conservation in the North American West, reduce global warming and conventional pollution resulting from the use of fossil fuels, and promote environmental protection efforts in California. The Hewlett Foundation opposes coal and natural gas development. However, the Hewlett Foundation is a donor to the Breakthrough Institute,

===Journalism===
Hewlett collaborated with the Center for Investigative Reporting to create California Watch, an investigative reporting project focused on California news.

===Reproductive health===
The Hewlett Foundation make grants in developing countries and in the United States to provide and advocate for family planning and reproductive health services. The Hewlett Foundation has given major financial support to Planned Parenthood and the International Planned Parenthood Federation.

===International grants tables===

The following table lists the top sectors to which the Hewlett Foundation has committed funding within its Global Development and Population Program. Data are taken from the International Aid Transparency Initiative activities publication, and is expected to cover 21% of the foundation&#x27;s overall grantmaking; this does not include international grantmaking in Environment, Education, and other program areas, although those total a significant proportion of grants. The Foundation&#x27;s Climate Initiative, in particular, is oriented toward international as well as U.S.-focused work. The sector names use the DAC 3 Digit Sector names.

The following table lists the all-time top 30 grantees, as recorded in the IATI activities publication.

<text>Jigme Dorji Wangchuck (, ; 2 May 1928 – 21 July 1972) was the 3rd Druk Gyalpo of Bhutan.

He began to open Bhutan to the outside world, began modernization, and took the first step towards democratization.

==Early life==
Jigme Dorji Wangchuck was born in 1928 in Thruepang Palace in Trongsa. At a young age, he was apprenticed in etiquette and leadership at the royal court of his father the King. Wangchuck was educated in a British manner in Kalimpong and Bishop Cotton School, Simla and he went on study tours to many foreign countries such as Scotland and Switzerland from where he drew inspiration to develop Bhutan with suitable adaptations.
In 1943, he was appointed Trongsa &quot;Dronyer&quot; and then elevated as the 25th Paro &quot;Penlop&quot; in 1950, upon the death of the 24th Paro &quot;Penlop&quot;, Tshering Penjor (1902–1949). Wangchuck married &quot;Ashi&quot; Kesang Choden Wangchuck (born 1930), the daughter of &quot;Gongzim&quot; (Lord Chamberlain) Sonam Topgay Dorji (1896–1953), at the Ugyen Pelri Palace, Paro, on 5 October 1951. The royal wedding was held at the Garden Palace. The following year, Wangchuck became the King after his father died in Kuenga Rabten Palace. Coronation was held in Punakha Dzong on 27 October 1952.

==Reign==
===Father of modern Bhutan===
During his 20-year reign that ended in July 1972, the fundamental reorientation of Bhutanese society began.
Wangchuck not only achieved the reorganisation of society and government, but also consolidated Bhutan&#x27;s sovereignty and security. He mobilised resources from the international donors as aid. Wangchuck&#x27;s strategy was to broaden the source of aid by developing relationships with other countries. Bhutan joined the Colombo Plan in 1962 to obtain international aid. However, India became the main source of financial and technical assistance. He was a deft and farsighted planner in the sense that he modernised Bhutan without destabilizing its culture and tradition. Wangchuck brought modern techniques and methods to preserve and promote the culture of Bhutan, yet at the same time, he introduced Western science and technology. He was a forerunner among environmentalists in this part of the world. The Manas Sanctuary established in 1966 was one of the first in the region.

===Political and social reforms===
In the context of Bhutan, there were small groups who were bonded labourers. They would work on the farms of the aristocratic and prominent families. In return, they would receive food, lodging and clothes. As soon as he became the King, labourers who worked on the royal lands were made into tenants and sharecroppers instead of indentured labourers. Later, similar indentured labourers were set free in other areas of the country, especially in some parts of Eastern Bhutan, where they were concentrated.
In 1953, Wangchuck opened the National Assembly of Bhutan in 1953 in Punakha Dzong. For the first time, elders from different gewogs (administrative units) were invited to voice their concerns, ideas and solutions for the future of this country. At the same time, it was a forum for Wangchuck to share his larger vision for Bhutan in the years to come. 
After the National Assembly was established in 1953, the king drafted and devised a series of progressive laws for the Kingdom. The King brought out a holistic set of laws covering fundamental aspects of Bhutanese life such as land, livestock, marriage, inheritance, property and so forth. The Thrimzhung Chenmo (Supreme Law) was passed by the National Assembly in 1959. The laws are very organic, coherently interrelated within themselves and to the evolving reality and manifested his vision of law-based society.
Along with the promulgation of Thrimzhung Chenmo, a mechanism to implement and enforce laws was needed. Wangchuck decided to open the judiciary, first with the appointment of Thrimpons (judges) in districts, and then finally to the High Court, which was set up in 1968. These administrative and social reforms were prior to any economic modernisation programmes. 
In 1955, he intensified the conversion of commodity taxes to cash taxes by assessing land for cash taxation. Cash taxes were nominal, but moving from commodity taxes to cash taxes was a radical step at that time.
Apart from promulgation of better laws and tax reforms, the Royal Bhutan Army was formally established in 1963. Furthermore, the entitlements of all officials were converted from commodities to cash and new designations were given. Wangchuck established new Ministries in 1968.

===Culture and education===
The king paid considerable policy attention on preserving Bhutanese culture so that Bhutan could always perpetuate itself as a culturally distinct nation, in particular with a flourishing Buddhist culture. He commissioned Buddhist monuments, including a large statue of the Buddha near the parliament building in Thimphu, as well as ornate copies of Buddhist texts such as the Kangyur and Tengyur.

He established Simtokha Rigzhung Lobdra (now known as the Institute of Language and Cultural Studies) in 1967, where a new breed of traditional scholars could be nurtured. He also increased the number of monks in many dratshangs. During his reign the systematic phonetic, syntax and grammatic rules of Dzongkha language were devised.
To propagate culture and traditions in schools, and to study scientific disciplines as well as humanities, the Third King established modern education on a wide spread basis. He established what were then the centres of education excellence with two public schools: Yangchenphug, in western Bhutan in 1969, and the other, Kanglung, in eastern Bhutan in 1968. An Agriculture Department was created to improve nutrition and to generate income from horticulture. The Kingdom&#x27;s free health service was also founded.

===Infrastructure development===
Modernising Bhutan&#x27;s infrastructure for transportation, communications, education, health system and agriculture started after India was receptive enough to offer aid. India became independent in 1947, and was not in any immediate position to help Bhutan. Wangchuck officially visited India in 1954. The first Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru made a historic journey to Bhutan in September 1958. King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck then paid repeated visits to India.
A year after Nehru visited Bhutan in 1958, the development of Bhutan&#x27;s modern infrastructure began, with assistance from India. Although road construction started in 1959, a large scale undertaking became systematic two years later in 1961, with the commencement of the 1st Five Year Plan (FYP) that envisaged construction of 177 km of road, 108 schools, three hospitals, and 45 clinics. In 1961, motor road transport reached Thimphu. The systematic envisioning of the economic future of Bhutan through FYPs was put into practice in 1961. The idea of budgeting and programming on a five-year basis is a legacy from that period. The construction of roads expanded vigorously to the end of Jigme Dorji Wangchuck&#x27;s reign; by his death, more than 1200 km (750 miles) of road had been built in the country. His last visit to central Bhutan was partly to open the Zhunglam, the highway between Wangdue Phodrang and Trongsa, in 1971.

===Foreign relations===
The king&#x27;s priority was to continue deepening the excellent relationship with India. The second priority was to diversify the relationship with other countries. He intended to strike close economic relationship with Bangladesh. Bhutan was the first nation after India to recognise the independence of Bangladesh.
One key event in his era was enabling Bhutan to join the United Nations in 1971, when it became its 125th member.

==Death==
Wangchuck suffered from long-term heart problems; he had his first heart attack at the age of 20. In July 1972, Wangchuck traveled to Nairobi to receive treatment for this condition, but he died suddenly during this visit. The king&#x27;s body was subsequently flown back to Bhutan to be cremated there.

<doc id="570779" wikidata="Q257456" url="?curid=570779" title="Fanny Crosby">
<text>Frances Jane van Alstyne (née Crosby; March 24, 1820 – February 12, 1915), more commonly known as Fanny J. Crosby, was an American mission worker, poet, lyricist, and composer. She was a prolific hymnist, writing more than 8,000 hymns and gospel songs, with more than 100 million copies printed. She is also known for her teaching and her rescue mission work. By the end of the 19th century, she was a household name.

Crosby was known as the &quot;Queen of Gospel Song Writers&quot; and as the &quot;Mother of modern congregational singing in America&quot;, with most American hymnals containing her work. Her gospel songs were &quot;paradigmatic of all revival music&quot;, and Ira Sankey attributed the success of the Moody and Sankey evangelical campaigns largely to Crosby&#x27;s hymns. Some of Crosby&#x27;s best-known songs include &quot;Pass Me Not, O Gentle Saviour&quot;, &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;, &quot;Jesus Is Tenderly Calling You Home&quot;, &quot;Praise Him, Praise Him&quot;, &quot;Rescue the Perishing&quot;, and &quot;To God Be the Glory&quot;. Some publishers were hesitant to have so many hymns by one person in their hymnals, so Crosby used nearly 200 different pseudonyms during her career.

Crosby also wrote more than 1,000 secular poems and had four books of poetry published, as well as two best-selling autobiographies. Additionally, she co-wrote popular secular songs, as well as political and patriotic songs and at least five cantatas on biblical and patriotic themes, including &quot;The Flower Queen&quot;, the first secular cantata by an American composer. She was committed to Christian rescue missions and was known for her public speaking.

==Early life and education==

Frances Jane Crosby was born on March 24, 1820, in the village of Brewster, about north of New York City. She was the only child of John Crosby and his second wife Mercy Crosby, both of whom were relatives of Revolutionary War spy Enoch Crosby. He was a widower who had a daughter from his first marriage. According to C. Bernard Ruffin, John and Mercy were possibly first cousins; however, &quot;by the time Fanny Crosby came to write her memoirs [in 1906], the fact that her mother and father were related... had become a source of embarrassment, and she maintained that she did not know anything about his lineage&quot;.

Crosby was proud of her Puritan heritage. She traced her ancestry from Anna Brigham and Simon Crosby who arrived in Boston in 1635 (and were among the founders of Harvard College); their descendants married into Mayflower families, making Crosby a descendant of Elder William Brewster, Edward Winslow, and Thomas Prence, and a member of the exclusive Daughters of the Mayflower.

She was also a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution in Bridgeport, Connecticut, writing the verses of the state song of the Connecticut branch. Through Simon Crosby, Fanny was also a relative of Presbyterian minister Howard Crosby and his neoabolitionist son Ernest Howard Crosby, as well as singers Bing and Bob Crosby.

At six weeks old, Crosby caught a cold and developed inflammation of the eyes. Mustard poultices were applied to treat the discharges. According to Crosby, this procedure damaged her optic nerves and blinded her, but modern physicians think that her blindness was more likely congenital and, given her age, may simply not have been noticed by her parents.

Her father died in November 1820 when Fanny was only six months old, so she was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother Eunice Paddock Crosby (born about 1778; died about 1831). These women grounded her in Christian principles, helping her memorize long passages from the Bible, and she became an active member of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Manhattan.

When Crosby was three, the family moved to North Salem, New York, where Eunice had been raised. In April 1825, she was examined by the surgeon Valentine Mott, who concluded that her condition was inoperable and that her blindness was permanent.

At age eight, Crosby wrote her first poem which described her condition. She later stated: &quot;It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I thank him for the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me.&quot; She also once said, &quot;when I get to heaven, the first face that shall ever gladden my sight will be that of my Savior&quot;. According to biographer Annie Willis, &quot;had it not been for her affliction she might not have so good an education or have so great an influence, and certainly not so fine a memory&quot;.

In 1828, Mercy and Fanny moved to the home of a Mrs. Hawley in Ridgefield, Connecticut. While residing in Ridgefield, they attended the Presbyterian church on the village green. Historian Edith L. Blumhofer described the Crosby home environment as sustained by &quot;an abiding Christian faith&quot;. Crosby memorized five chapters of the Bible each week from age 10, with the encouragement of her grandmother and later Mrs. Hawley; by age 15, she had memorized the four gospels, the Pentateuch, the Book of Proverbs, the Song of Solomon, and many of the Psalms. From 1832, a music teacher came to Ridgefield twice a week to give singing lessons to her and some of the other children. Around the same time, she attended her first Methodist church services at the Methodist Episcopal Church, and she was delighted by their hymns.

Crosby enrolled at the New York Institution for the Blind (NYIB) in 1835, just before her 15th birthday. She remained there for eight years as a student, and another two years as a graduate pupil, during which time she learned to play the piano, organ, harp, and guitar, and became a good soprano singer. While she was studying at NYIB in 1838, her mother Mercy remarried and the couple had three children together. Mercy&#x27;s husband abandoned her in 1844.

==Early career (1843–1858)==
After graduation from the NYIB in 1843, Crosby joined a group of lobbyists in Washington, D.C., arguing for support of education for the blind. She was the first woman to speak in the United States Senate when she read a poem there. She appeared before the joint houses of Congress and recited these lines:

Crosby was among the students from the NYIB who gave a concert for Congress on January 24, 1844. She recited an original composition calling for an institution for educating the blind in every state which was praised by John Quincy Adams, among others. Two days later, she was among a group of Blind Institution students who gave a presentation to notable people at Trenton, New Jersey, where she recited an original poem calling for the aid and education of the blind. President James K. Polk visited the NYIB in 1845 and Crosby recited a poem that she composed for the occasion which praised &quot;republican government&quot;. In 1851, she addressed the New York state legislature.

In April 1846, Crosby spoke before a joint session of the United States Congress, with delegations from the Boston and Philadelphia Institutions for the Blind, &quot;to advocate support for the education of the blind in Boston, Philadelphia, and New York&quot;. She testified before a special congressional subcommittee, and she performed in the music room at the White House for President Polk and his wife. Among the songs that she sang as she accompanied herself on the piano was her own composition:

In 1846, Crosby was an instructor at the NYIB and was listed as a &quot;graduate pupil&quot;. She subsequently joined the school&#x27;s faculty, teaching grammar, rhetoric, and history; she remained there until three days before her wedding on March 5, 1858. While teaching at the NYIB, she befriended future US president Grover Cleveland then aged 17. The two spent many hours together at the end of each day, and he often transcribed the poems that she dictated to him. He wrote for her a recommendation which was published in her 1906 autobiography. She wrote a poem that was read at the dedication of Cleveland&#x27;s birthplace in Caldwell, New Jersey, in March 1913, being unable to attend due to her health.

==Christian faith==
Crosby was a longtime member of the Sixth Avenue Bible Baptist Church in Brooklyn, New York, which has been in existence continuously since 1867. She served as a consecrated Baptist missionary, deaconess, and lay preacher. She wrote hymns together with her minister Robert Lowry, such as &quot;All the Way My Savior Leads Me&quot; and many others.

There was a cholera epidemic in New York City from May to November 1849, and she remained at the NYIB to nurse the sick rather than leaving the city. Subsequently, according to Blumhofer, &quot;Crosby seemed worn, languid, even depressed&quot; when the Institution re-opened in November, forcing her to teach a lighter load. According to Bernard Ruffin:

In the Fall of 1850, after being troubled by a dream, Crosby went to revival meetings at the thirteenth Street Methodist Church in New York city where she twice vainly sought the peace with God she craved, but which she finally realized on November 30 during a congregational hymn of consecration while seeking God alone at the altar. Crosby stated that she then felt &quot;flooded with celestial light.&quot;

Crosby attended churches of various denominations until spring 1887, including the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn Heights led by Congregationalist abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher who was an innovator with church music. She attended the Trinity Episcopal church, and liked to worship at the North West Dutch Reformed church and the Central Presbyterian Church (later known as the Brooklyn Tabernacle). In later life, she said that one of her favorite preachers was Theodore Ledyard Cuyler, minister of the North East Dutch Reformed Church.

Tradition insists that she was a member in good standing of the John Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Manhattan, but there are no contemporaneous records to confirm this. By 1869, she attended the Chelsea Methodist Episcopal Church.

Crosby was not identified publicly with the American holiness movement of the second half of the 19th century and left no record of an experience of entire sanctification. She was, however, a fellow traveler of the Wesleyan holiness movement, including prominent members of the American Holiness movement in her circle of friends and attending Wesleyan/Holiness camp meetings. For example, she was a friend of Walter and Phoebe Palmer, &quot;the mother of the holiness movement&quot; and &quot;arguably the most influential female theologian in Christian history&quot;, and their daughter Phoebe Knapp, with whom she wrote &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;; she often visited the Methodist camp grounds at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, as their guest. She vacationed each summer at Ocean Grove between 1877 and 1897 (and possibly longer), where she would speak in the Great Auditorium and hold receptions in her cottage to meet her admirers.

In 1877, Crosby met William J. Kirkpatrick, one of the most prolific composers of gospel song tunes and &quot;the most prominent publisher in the Wesleyan/Holiness Movement&quot;. She called him &quot;Kirkie&quot; and wrote many hymns with him. Some of her hymns reflected her Wesleyan beliefs, including her call to consecrated Christian living in &quot;I Am Thine, O Lord&quot; (1875):

In 1887, she joined the Cornell Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church by &quot;confession of faith&quot;.

==Early writing career (1841–1865)==
===Poetry===

Crosby&#x27;s earliest published poem was sent without her knowledge to P. T. Barnum, who published it in his &quot;The Herald of Freedom&quot;. She was examined by George Combe, a visiting Scottish phrenologist, who pronounced her a &quot;born poetess&quot;. She had experienced some temporary opposition to her poetry by the faculty of the Blind Institution, but her inclination to write was encouraged by this experience. The Institution found Hamilton Murray to teach her poetic composition, though he admitted his own inability to compose poetry.

In 1841, &quot;New York Herald&quot; published Crosby&#x27;s eulogy on the death of President William Henry Harrison, thus beginning her literary career. Her poems were published frequently in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the &quot;Clinton Signal&quot;, the &quot;Fireman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Saturday Emporium&quot;.
Crosby was reluctant to have her poems published, as she considered them to be &quot;unfinished productions&quot;, but she acquiesced eventually because it would publicize the Institution and raise funds for it. (She had had an illness that caused her to leave the NYIB in order to recuperate.) Her first book &quot;A Blind Girl and Other Poems&quot; was published in April 1844 after encouragement by the Institution, including &quot;An Evening Hymn&quot; based on Psalm 4:8, which she described as her first published hymn. In 1853, her &quot;Monterey and Other Poems&quot; was published which included poems focusing on the recent Mexican–American War, and a poem pleading for the US to help those affected by the Great Famine of Ireland. She stated in her 1903 autobiography, edited by Will Carleton, that she &quot;was under a feeling of sadness and depression at this time&quot;.

In 1853, Crosby&#x27;s poem &quot;The Blind Orphan Girl&quot; was included in Caroline M. Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;The History of the Blind Vocalists&quot;. Her third book &quot;A Wreath of Columbia&#x27;s Flowers&quot; was published in 1858 at about the time when she resigned from the Blind Institution and got married. It contains four short stories and 30 poems.

===Popular songs===
Crosby had been inspired by the success of the melodies of Stephen Foster, so she and George F. Root wrote at least 60 secular &quot;people&#x27;s songs&quot; or parlour songs between August 1851 and 1857, some for the popular minstrel shows. (Root had taught music at the Blind Institution from 1845–50). The minstrel shows had a negative reputation among some Christians and classical musicians, so their participation in these compositions was deliberately obscured. &quot;Like many cultured people of the day,&quot; writes Bernard Ruffin, &quot;[Root] considered native American music rather crude.&quot; He chose to &quot;Europeanize&quot; his name (like many American artists and musicians of that era) to &quot;George Friederich Wurzel&quot; (German for Root), while Crosby&#x27;s name was sometimes omitted altogether.

For many years, Crosby was usually paid only $1 or $2 per poem, with all rights to the song being retained by the composer or publisher of the music.

In the summer of 1851, George Root and Crosby both taught at the North Reading Musical Institute in North Reading, Massachusetts. Their first song was &quot;Fare Thee Well, Kitty Dear&quot; (1851) which evoked old-South imagery. Crosby&#x27;s lyrics were based on a suggestion by Root, which she described as &quot;the grief of a colored man on the death of his beloved.&quot; It was written for and performed exclusively by Henry Wood&#x27;s Minstrels and published by John Andrews, who specialized in printing &quot;neat, quick &amp; cheap,&quot; according to Karen Linn. &quot;This song was not a hit, and had no lasting influence,&quot; according to Linn, as &quot;its style is far too literary, the words not in dialect, the cause of sorrow seems to be a lover (rather than &#x27;massa&#x27;, or Little Eva, or homesickness: all more appropriate causes for slave sorrow according to the popular culture)&quot;. In 1852, Root signed a three-year contract with William Hall &amp; Son.

Despite this initial setback, Crosby continued to teach at North Reading during her vacations in 1852 and 1853, where she wrote the lyrics for many of her collaborations with Root. Among their joint compositions were &quot;Bird of the North&quot; (1852) and &quot;Mother, Sweet Mother, Why Linger Away?&quot; (1852).

Crosby and Root&#x27;s first successful popular song was &quot;The Hazel Dell&quot; (1853), a sentimental ballad described by its publisher as &quot;a very pretty and easy song, containing the elements of great popularity,&quot; released as the work of G.F. Wurzel toward the end of 1853. It was a hit that was &quot;one of the most popular songs in the country&quot; because of its performance by both Henry Wood&#x27;s Minstrels and Christy&#x27;s Minstrels, selling more than 200,000 copies of sheet music. It is described as being on &quot;the fringes of blackface minstrelsy, although it lacks dialect or any hint of buffoonery&quot;, about a beautiful girl who died young.

An article in the December 1854 issue of &quot;New York Musical Review&quot; proclaimed the death of &quot;Negro minstrelsy.&quot; It listed &quot;Hazel Dell,&quot; along with Stephen Foster&#x27;s songs &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot; (1851) and &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; (1853), as popular songs that were evidence of the &quot;&quot;bleaching&quot; process... observable in the gradual rejection of the plantation, and the adoption of sentiments and poetic forms of expression, characteristic rather of the intelligent Caucasian&quot;.

Toward the end of 1853, William Hall &amp; Son released &quot;Greenwood Bell&quot; at the same time as &quot;Hazel Dell&quot;, but credited it to Root and Crosby. &quot;Greenwood Bell&quot; describes the funerals of a child, a young man, and an aged person, and the tolling of the bell at the Greenwood Cemetery. Other songs written by Crosby and Root included &quot;O How Glad to Get Home&quot; and &quot;They Have Sold Me Down the River (The Negro Father&#x27;s Lament)&quot; (1853). Their song &quot;There&#x27;s Music in the Air&quot; (1854) became a hit song and was listed in &quot;Variety Music Cavalcade&quot; as one of the most popular songs of 1854; it was in songbooks until at least the 1930s and became a college song at Princeton University.

Crosby-Root songs were published by other publishers after the expiration of Root&#x27;s contract with William Hall &amp; Son in 1855 (and after being rejected by Nathan Richardson of Russell &amp; Richardson of Boston), including &quot;Six Songs by Wurzel&quot; published in 1855 by S. Brainard&#x27;s Sons of Cleveland, Ohio. These six Root-Crosby songs were &quot;O How Glad to Get Home,&quot; &quot;Honeysuckle Glen,&quot; &quot;The Church in the Wood,&quot; &quot;All Together Now,&quot; and &quot;Proud World, Good-by.&quot; The most popular of these songs was &quot;Rosalie, the Prairie Flower&quot;, about the death of a young girl. It was popularized in the 1850s by the Christy Minstrels; it sold more than 125,000 copies of sheet music and earned nearly $3,000 (~$ in ) in royalties for Root — and almost nothing for Crosby. Crosby also wrote the words for popular songs for other composers, including &quot;There is a Bright and Sunny Spot&quot; (1856) for Clare W. Beames.

===Cantatas===
Between 1852 and 1854, Crosby wrote the librettos of three cantatas for Root. Their first was &quot;The Flower Queen; The Coronation of the Rose&quot; (1852), often described as &quot;the first secular cantata written by an American.&quot; It is an opera &quot;in all but name,&quot; described as a &quot;popular operetta&quot; which &quot;illustrated nineteenth-century American romanticism.&quot; In her 1906 autobiography, Crosby explained the theme of this cantata:
&quot;The Flower Queen&quot; was written as &quot;a work for teenage girls (scored for first and second soprano and alto).&quot; It was performed first on March 11, 1853, by the young ladies of Jacob Abbott&#x27;s Springer Institute, and almost immediately repeated by Root&#x27;s students at the Rutgers Female Institute; it was praised by R. Storrs Willis. It was performed an estimated 1,000 times throughout the United States in the first four years after its publication. The success of &quot;The Flower Queen&quot; and subsequent cantatas brought great acclaim and fortune to Root, with little of either for Crosby.

The second Root-Crosby cantata was &quot;Daniel, or the Captivity and Restoration&quot;, based on the Old Testament&#x27;s story of Daniel. It was composed in 1853 for Root&#x27;s choir at the Mercer Street Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. This cantata comprised 35 songs, with music composed with William Batchelder Bradbury and words by Crosby and Union Theological Seminary student Chauncey Marvin Cady. Some of its principal choruses were first performed on July 15, 1853, by the students at Root&#x27;s New York Normal Institute.

In 1854, Root and Crosby collaborated to compose &quot;The Pilgrim Fathers&quot;, described as an &quot;antebellum landmark&quot; in dramatic cantatas. According to Blumhofer, it &quot;featured the contemporary evangelical reading of American history.&quot; Crosby wrote the libretto for a cantata entitled &quot;The Excursion&quot;, with music by Baptist music professor Theodore Edson Perkins, one of the founders of New York music publishing house Brown &amp; Perkins. In 1886, Crosby and William Howard Doane wrote &quot;Santa Claus&#x27; Home; or, The Christmas Excursion&quot;, a Christmas cantata published by Biglow &amp; Main.

===Political songs===
In addition to poems of welcome to visiting dignitaries, Crosby wrote songs of a political nature, such as about the major battles of the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.

By the 1840 US Presidential election, she was &quot;an ardent Democrat&quot; and wrote verse against Whig candidate (and ultimate winner) William Henry Harrison. By 1852, she switched her political allegiance from support for the pro-slavery Democrats to the anti-slavery Whigs, writing the poem &quot;Carry Me On&quot; for them in 1852. After the election of Democrat Franklin Pierce as US President in November 1852, she wrote:

Though she considered herself a Democrat at the time, Crosby was a keen admirer of the leading Whig, U.S. Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, who in 1848 made a tour of large eastern cities. He visited the New York Institution for the Blind in New York City, where Crosby lived. The visit came two years after the death of Henry Clay Jr., in the Mexican–American War. Crosby recalled that &quot;the great statesman was never quite himself after his son&#x27;s death, and I purposely avoided all mention of it in the address of welcome on the day he came to visit us, lest I mighty wound the heart of the man whom I had learned not only to venerate but to love; for Mr. Clay was always an especial favorite among public men. There was a strength in his character and an earnestness in his speeches that appealed to me more than I can tell. ... I would have challenged any person, whether Whig or Democrat, Northerner or Southerner to come within range of the man&#x27;s eloquence without being moved to admiration and profound respect; for his personal magnetism was wonderful.&quot;

Crosby was a strict abolitionist and supported Abraham Lincoln and the newly created Republican Party. After the Civil War, she was a devoted supporter of the Grand Army of the Republic and its political aims.

===Patriotic songs===
During the American Civil War, according to Edith Blumhofer, Crosby &quot;vented patriotism in verse,&quot; and it evoked &quot;an outpouring of songs—some haunting, some mournful, some militaristic, a few even gory&quot;, but &quot;her texts testified to her clear moral sense about the issues that fomented in the war years.&quot; She wrote many poems supporting the Union cause, including &quot;Dixie for the Union&quot; (1861), written before the outbreak of hostilities to the tune of Dixie (the tune adopted later by the Confederate States of America as a patriotic anthem). The first of the five stanzas is:


Crosby wrote the words and William B. Bradbury composed the music, soon after they met in February 1864, for the popular patriotic Civil War song &quot;There is a Sound Among the Forest Trees&quot;. Her text encourages volunteers to join the Union forces and incorporates references to the history of the United States, including the Pilgrim Fathers and the Battle of Bunker Hill.

Also during the American Civil War, Crosby wrote &quot;Song to Jeff Davis&quot; directed at Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America, which expressed her belief in the morality of the Union cause: &quot;Our stars and stripes are waving, And Heav&#x27;n will speed our cause&quot;. She also wrote &quot;Good-By, Old Arm,&quot; a tribute to wounded soldiers with music by Philip Philips, &quot;Our Country,&quot; and &quot;A Tribute (to the memory of our dead heroes).&quot;

As late as September 1908, Crosby wrote patriotic poems for the Daughters of the American Revolution, including &quot;The State We Honor&quot; which extolls the virtues of her adopted state of Connecticut.

==Marriage and family==
In the summer of 1843, Crosby met Alexander van Alstyne Jr. (sometimes spelled van Alstine or van Alsteine), called &quot;Van&quot; by his friends. He also was blind and enrolled at the NYIB, where he was a casual acquaintance of Crosby and sometimes a student in her classes. He was a teacher at NYIB for two years from 1855; during this time, the couple were engaged to be married, necessitating her resignation from NYIB three days prior to their wedding at Maspeth, New York, on March 5, 1858.

After their wedding, the van Alstynes lived in a small home in the rural village of Maspeth, New York, with a population of about 200 people—present-day Maspeth, Queens, New York, and no longer rural.

At her husband&#x27;s insistence, Crosby continued to use her maiden name as her literary name, but she chose to use her married name on all legal documents. However, according to biographer Edith Blumhofer: &quot;Despite her education, her handwriting was barely legible, and on legal documents she signed her name with an X witnessed by friends&quot;.

In 1859, the van Alstynes had a daughter named Frances who died in her sleep soon after birth. Some believe that the cause was typhoid fever, although Darlene Neptune speculates that it may have been SIDS, and that Crosby&#x27;s hymn &quot;Safe in the Arms of Jesus&quot; was inspired by her death.

After the death of their daughter, Van became increasingly reclusive; Crosby never spoke publicly about being a mother, aside from mentioning it in a few interviews towards the end of her life: &quot;Now I am going to tell you of something that only my closest friends know. I became a mother and knew a mother&#x27;s love. God gave us a tender babe but the angels came down and took our infant up to God and to His throne&quot;. In late 1859, the van Alstynes moved frequently, &quot;establishing a pattern that continued for the rest of their lives&quot;, and never owned their own home, living in rented accommodation without a lease.

In addition to Crosby&#x27;s income as a poet and lyricist, Van played the organ at two churches in New York City, and gave private music lessons. The couple could have lived comfortably on their combined income, but Crosby &quot;had other priorities and gave away anything that was not necessary to their daily survival&quot;. Van and Fanny organized concerts with half the proceeds given to aid the poor, in which she gave recitations of her poems and sang, and he played various instruments. Van provided the music for some of her poetry, although Fanny indicated that &quot;his taste was mostly for the wordless melodies of the classics&quot;. The van Alstynes collaborated on the production of a hymnal featuring only hymns written by them, but it was rejected by Biglow and Main—ostensibly because the directors believed that the public would not buy a hymnal featuring only two composers, but probably due to the complexity of the melodies. In 1874, Crosby was reported to be &quot;living in a destitute condition&quot;.

For many years, the van Alstynes had &quot;a most unusual married life&quot;, and lived together only intermittently. By 1880, they had separated, living both separately and independently due to a rift in their marriage of uncertain origin. At one point soon after, Crosby moved to a &quot;dismal flat&quot; at 9 Frankfort Street, near one of Manhattan&#x27;s worst slums in the Lower East Side. Thereafter, she lived at several different addresses in and around Manhattan.

Van Alstyne rarely accompanied Crosby when she traveled, and she vacationed without him. Despite living separately for more than two decades, Crosby insisted that they &quot;maintained an amiable relationship&quot;, kept in contact with one another, and even ministered together on occasions in this period. For example, Alexander played a piano solo at the third annual reunion of the Underhill Society of America on June 15, 1895, in Yonkers, New York, while Crosby read an ode to Captain John Underhill, the progenitor of the American branch of the Underhill family. Her only recorded admission of marital unhappiness was in 1903, when she commented on her late husband in Will Carleton&#x27;s &quot;This is My Story&quot;: &quot;He had his faults—and so have I mine, but notwithstanding these, we loved each other to the last&quot;.

In 1896, Crosby moved from Manhattan to an apartment in a poor section of Brooklyn, living with friends at South Third Street, Brooklyn, near the home of Ira D. Sankey and his wife Fannie, and near the mansion owned by Phoebe Knapp.

==Career in writing hymns (1864–1915)==

Crosby was &quot;the most prolific of all nineteenth-century American sacred song writers&quot;. By the end of her career she had written almost 9,000 hymns, using scores of pen names assigned to her by publishers who wanted to disguise the proliferation of her compositions in their publications.

It is estimated that books containing her lyrics sold 100 million copies. However, due to the low regard for lyricists in the popular song industry during her lifetime, and what June Hadden Hobbs sees as &quot;the hypocrisy of sacred music publishers&quot; which resulted for Crosby in &quot;a sad and probably representative tale of exploitation of female hymn writers&quot;, and the contemporary perception that &quot;Crosby made a very profitable living off writing songs that were sung (and played) by the masses&quot;, &quot;like many of the lyricists of the day, Crosby was exploited by copyright conventions that assigned rights not to the lyricist but to the composer of the music... Crosby was paid a flat fee of one or two dollars a hymn&quot;. In her 1906 autobiography, Crosby insisted she wrote her hymns &quot;in a sanctified manner&quot;, and never for financial or commercial considerations, and that she had donated her royalties to &quot;worthy causes&quot;.

Crosby set a goal of winning a million people to Christ through her hymns, and whenever she wrote a hymn she prayed it would bring women and men to Christ, and kept careful records of those reported to have been saved through her hymns.

Referring to Crosby&#x27;s songs, the &quot;Dictionary of American Religious Biography&quot; indicated: &quot;by modern standards her work may be considered mawkish or too sentimental. But their simple, homey appeal struck a responsive chord in Victorian culture. Their informal ballad style broke away from the staid, formal approach of earlier periods, touching deep emotions in singers and listeners alike. Instead of dismissing her words as maudlin or saccharine, audiences thrilled to them as the essence of genuine, heartfelt Christianity&quot;. Crosby&#x27;s hymns were popular because they placed &quot;a heightened emphasis on religious experiences, emotions, and testimonies&quot; and reflected &quot;a sentimental, romanticized relationship between the believer and Christ&quot;, rather than using the negative descriptions of earlier hymns that emphasised the sinfulness of people.

Ann Douglas argues that Crosby was one of the female authors who &quot;emasculated American religion&quot; and helped shift it from &quot;a rigorous Calvinism&quot; to &quot;an anti-intellectual and sentimental mass culture&quot;. Feminist scholars have suggested that &quot;emphases in her hymns both revealed and accelerated the feminizing of American evangelicalism&quot;.

Her hymns were published by many notable publishers and publishing companies:
* William B. Bradbury published her hymns in his &quot;Golden Censer&quot; (1864), a book of Sunday School hymns that sold three million copies.
* For several years Crosby contracted to write three hymns a week for Hubert Main, whose Biglow and Main Co. was formed after Bradbury&#x27;s death. The company purchased 5900 poems from her for use in the Sunday School publications, and published nearly 2000 of them. By 1889, Crosby may have written over 2500 hymns for the combined publishing houses of Bradbury, and Biglow and Main.
* Methodist song publisher Philip Phillips, for whom Crosby wrote a cycle of forty poems based on the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, and the lyrics for an estimated 525 hymns.

===Musical and lyrical collaborators===
William Howard Doane was an industrialist who became Crosby&#x27;s principal collaborator in writing gospel music, composing melodies for an estimated 1,500 Crosby&#x27;s lyrics. Doane and Crosby collaborated through Biglow and Main, and also privately through Doane&#x27;s Northern Baptist endeavours. Eventually Crosby entrusted to Doane the business aspects of her compositions.

In early 1868 Crosby met wealthy Methodist Phoebe Palmer Knapp, who was married to Joseph Fairchild Knapp, co-founder of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The Knapps published hymnals initially for use in the Sunday School of Saint John&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church in Brooklyn, which was superintended by Joseph F. Knapp for 22 years, while Phoebe Knapp took responsibility for 200 children in the infants&#x27; department. They first collaborated on &quot;Notes of Joy&quot;, the first hymnal edited by Knapp, who also contributed 94 of the 172 tunes, and published by her brother, Walter C. Palmer Jr., in 1869. Of the 21 hymns Crosby contributed to &quot;Notes of Joy&quot;, including eight as &quot;The Children&#x27;s Friend&quot;, Knapp provided the music for fourteen of them. Their best-known collaboration was &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;, for which Crosby wrote words in the Knapps&#x27; music room for a tune written by Knapp, while Crosby was staying at the Knapp Mansion in 1873.

From 1871 to 1908, Crosby worked with Ira Sankey, who helped make her &quot;a household name to Protestants around the world&quot;. While Sankey was &quot;the premier promoter&quot; of gospel songs, &quot;Crosby ranked first as their provider&quot;. The evangelist team of Sankey and Dwight L. Moody brought many of Crosby&#x27;s hymns to the attention of Christians throughout the United States and Britain. Crosby was close friends with Sankey and his wife, Frances, and often stayed with them at their home in Northfield, Massachusetts, from 1886 for the annual summer Christian Workers&#x27; Conferences, and later in their Brooklyn. After Sankey&#x27;s eyesight was destroyed by glaucoma in March 1903, their friendship deepened and they often continued to compose hymns together at Sankey&#x27;s harmonium in his home.

===Crosby&#x27;s process===

Crosby described her hymn-writing process: &#x27;It may seem a little old-fashioned, always to begin one&#x27;s work with prayer, but I never undertake a hymn without first asking the good Lord to be my inspiration.&#x27; Her capacity for work was prodigious, and she could often compose six or seven hymns a day. Her poems and hymns were composed entirely in her mind, and she worked on as many as twelve hymns at once before dictating them to an amanuensis. On one occasion, Crosby composed 40 hymns before they were transcribed. Her lyrics would usually be transcribed by &quot;Van&quot; or later by her half-sister, Carolyn &quot;Carrie&quot; Ryder or her secretary Eva C. Cleaveland, as Crosby herself could write little more than her name. While Crosby had musical training, she did not compose the melodies for most of her lyrics. In 1903, Crosby claimed that &quot;Spring Hymn&quot; was the only hymn for which she wrote both the words and music.

In 1906 Crosby composed both the words and music for &quot;The Blood-Washed Throng&quot;, which was published and copyrighted by gospel singer Mary Upham Currier, a distant cousin who had been a well-known concert singer. While teaching at the NYIB, Crosby studied music under George F. Root, until his resignation in November 1850.

In 1921, Edward S. Ninde wrote: &quot;None would claim that she was a poetess in any large sense. Her hymns... have been severely criticised. Dr. Julian, the editor of the Dictionary of Hymnology, says that &#x27;they are, with few exceptions, very weak and poor,&#x27; and others insist that they are &#x27;crudely sentimental&#x27;. Some hymn books will give them no place whatever&quot;. According to &quot;Glimpses of Christian History&quot;, Crosby&#x27;s &quot;hymns have sometimes been criticized as &#x27;gushy and mawkishly sentimental&#x27; and critics have often attacked both her writing and her theology. Nonetheless, they were meaningful to her contemporaries and hymn writer George C. Stebbins stated, &#x27;There was probably no writer in her day who appealed more to the valid experience of the Christian life or who expressed more sympathetically the deep longings of the human heart than Fanny Crosby.&#x27; And many of her hymns have stood the test of time, still resonating with believers today&quot;.

==Rescue missions and later life==

Crosby will probably always be best known for her hymns, yet she wanted to be seen primarily as a rescue mission worker. According to Keith Schwanz: 
Many of Fanny&#x27;s hymns emerged from her involvement in the city missions, including &quot;More Like Jesus&quot; (1867), &quot;Pass Me Not, O Gentle Saviour&quot; (1868), and &quot;Rescue the Perishing&quot; (1869), which became the &quot;theme song of the home missions movement&quot; and was &quot;perhaps the most popular city mission song&quot;, with its &quot;wedding of personal piety and compassion for humanity&quot;. She celebrated the rescue mission movement in her 1895 hymn &quot;The Rescue Band&quot;.

Crosby had lived for decades in such areas of Manhattan as Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, the Bowery, and the Tenderloin. She was aware of the great needs of immigrants and the urban poor, and was passionate to help those around her through urban rescue missions and other compassionate ministry organizations. &quot;From the time I received my first check for my poems, I made up my mind to open my hand wide to those who needed assistance&quot;. Throughout her life, she was described as having &quot;a horror of wealth&quot;, never set prices for her speaking engagements, often refused honoraria, and &quot;what little she did accept she gave away almost as soon as she got it&quot;. She and her husband also organized concerts, with half the proceeds given to aid the poor. Throughout New York City, Crosby&#x27;s sympathies for the poor were well-known, but consisted primarily of indirect involvement by giving contributions from the sale of her poems, and by writing and sending poems for special occasions for these missions to the dispossessed, as well as sporadic visits to those missions.

===1865–1880===

Crosby supported the American Female Guardian Society and Home for the Friendless (founded in 1834) at 29 East 29th Street, for whom she wrote a hymn in 1865 that was sung by some of the Home&#x27;s children:

She wrote &quot;More Like Jesus Would I Be&quot; in June 1867 expressly for the sixth anniversary of the Howard Mission and Home for Little Wanderers, a nondenominational mission at New Bowery, Manhattan.

She was inspired to write &quot;Pass Me Not, O Gentle Saviour&quot; after speaking at a service at the Manhattan prison in spring 1868, from comments by some prisoners for the Lord not to pass them by. Doane set it to music and published it in &quot;Songs of Devotion&quot; in 1870. &quot;Pass Me Not&quot; became her first hymn to have global appeal, after it was used by Sankey in his crusades with Moody in Britain in 1874. Sankey said, &quot;No hymn was more popular at the meetings in London in 1875 than this one.&quot;

In April 1868, Crosby wrote &quot;Fifty Years Ago&quot; for the semi-centennial of the New-York Port Society, which was founded in 1818 &quot;for the promotion of the Gospel among the seamen in the Port of New-York&quot;.

By July 1869, Crosby was attending at least weekly meetings organized by the interdenominational New York City Mission. A young man was converted through her testimony, and she was inspired to write the words for &quot;Rescue the Perishing&quot; based on a title and a tune given to her by William Howard Doane a few days earlier.

Ira Sankey recalled the origins of &quot;Rescue the Perishing&quot; in his 1907 book &quot;My Life and the Story of the Gospel Hymns&quot;:
===1880–1900===
In 1880, aged 60, Crosby &quot;made a new commitment to Christ to serve the poor&quot; and to devote the rest of her life to home missionary work. She continued to live in a dismal flat at 9 Frankfort Street, near one of the worst slums in Manhattan, until about 1884. From this time, she increased her involvement in various missions and homes.

During the next three decades, she dedicated her time as &quot;Aunty Fanny&quot; to work at various city rescue missions, including the McAuley Water Street Mission, the Bowery Mission, the Howard Mission, the Cremore Mission, the Door of Hope, and other skid row missions. She spoke at YMCAs, churches, and prisons about the needs of the urban poor. Additionally, she was a passionate supporter of Frances Willard and the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and its endeavors to urge either abstinence or moderation in the use of alcohol.

For example, Crosby wrote the words for the song &quot;The Red Pledge&quot; before 1879, which advocated total abstinence from imbibing alcohol.

From about 1880, Crosby attended and supported the Helping Hand for Men in Manhattan (better known as the Water Street Mission), &quot;America&#x27;s first rescue mission&quot;, which was founded by a married couple to minister to alcoholics and the unemployed. Jerry McAuley was a former alcoholic and thief who became a Christian in Sing Sing prison in 1864, and his wife Maria (c.(1847 – September 19, 1919) was a self-described &quot;river thief&quot; and &quot;fallen woman&quot;. Crosby often attended the Water Street Mission, &quot;conversing and counseling with those she met&quot;.

Crosby supported the Bowery Mission in Manhattan for two decades, beginning in November 1881. The Bowery Mission welcomed the ministry of women and she worked actively, often attending and speaking in the evening meetings. She addressed large crowds attending the anniversary service each year until the building was razed in a fire in 1897. She would also recite a poem which she&#x27;d written for the occasion, many of which were set to music by Victor Benke, the Mission&#x27;s volunteer organist from 1893–97. Among the songs that she and Benke collaborated on were six published in 1901: &quot;He Has Promised&quot; , &quot;There&#x27;s a Chorus Ever Ringing&quot; , &quot;God Bless Our School Today&quot; , &quot;Is There Something I Can Do?&quot; , &quot;On Joyful Wings&quot; , and &quot;Keep On Watching&quot; .

Jerry and Maria McAuley started the Cremorne Mission in 1882 in the Cremorne Garden at 104 West 32nd Street, as a &quot;beachhead in a vast jungle of vice and debauchery known as Tenderloin&quot; (near Sixth Avenue). Crosby attended the nightly 8 pm services, where gospel songs were often sung that were written by her and Doane, including &quot;ballads recalling mother&#x27;s prayers, reciting the evils of intemperance, or envisioning agonizing deathbed scenes intending to arouse long-buried memories and strengthen resolves&quot;. She was inspired to write a prayer after the death of Jerry McAuley in 1884 which was later included in rescue song books:

After McAuley&#x27;s death, Crosby continued to support the Cremorne Mission, now led by Samuel Hopkins Hadley.

Some of the city missions with which Crosby worked were operated by proponents of Wesleyan/Holiness doctrine, including the Door of Hope rescue home founded by socialite Emma Whittemore on October 25, 1890 in a house belonging to A.B. Simpson, intended as &quot;a refuge and a home for girls of the better class who have been tempted from home and right&quot;, and to rescue &quot;fallen girls&quot;.

===Later years (1900–1915)===
Crosby&#x27;s hymn writing declined in later years, but she was active in speaking engagements and missionary work among America&#x27;s urban poor almost until she died. She was well known, and she often met with presidents, generals, and other dignitaries. According to Blumhofer, &quot;The popularity of Fanny Crosby&#x27;s lyrics as well as her winsome personality catapulted her to fame&quot;.

Some of her wealthy friends contributed often to her financial needs, such as Doane, Sankey, and Phoebe Knapp, although she still tended to give generously to those whom she saw as less fortunate than herself. Her longtime publisher The Biglow and Main Company paid her a small stipend of $8 each week in recognition of her contributions to their business over the years, even after she submitted fewer lyrics to them. However, Knapp and others believed that Biglow and Main had made enormous profits because of Crosby without compensating her adequately for her contributions, and that she should be living more comfortably in her advanced years.

She had been ill with a serious heart condition for a few months by May 1900, and she still showed some effects from a fall, so her half-sisters traveled to Brooklyn to convince her to move from her room in the home of poet Will Carleton in Brooklyn to Bridgeport, Connecticut. They urged her to live with her widowed half-sister Julia &quot;Jule&quot; Athington and with Jule&#x27;s widowed younger sister Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; W. Rider. She and Rider rented a room together, before moving to a rented apartment where they lived until 1906. She transferred her church membership from Cornell Memorial Methodist Church in Manhattan to the First Methodist Church of Bridgeport in 1904, after moving to Bridgeport. Her husband &quot;Van&quot; died on July 18, 1902; he had been living in Brooklyn. She did not attend the funeral due to her own poor health. Phoebe Knapp paid for his burial at Mount Olivet Cemetery, Queens County, New York.

===Passing of friends, public appreciation===
Crosby and Rider moved to 226 Wells Street, Bridgeport, Connecticut, in summer 1906 because of Rider&#x27;s cancer. Carrie died of intestinal cancer in July 1907, and Phoebe Knapp died on July 10, 1908. Weeks later, Ira Sankey died having just sung &quot;Saved by Grace&quot;, one of Crosby&#x27;s most popular compositions.

On May 2, 1911, Crosby spoke to 5,000 people at the opening meeting of the Evangelistic Committee&#x27;s seventh annual campaign held in Carnegie Hall, after the crowd sang her songs for thirty minutes. On Crosby&#x27;s 94th birthday in March 1914, Alice Rector and the King&#x27;s Daughters of the First Methodist Church of Bridgeport, Connecticut, organized a Violet Day to honor her, which was publicized nationally by Hugh Main.

==Carleton controversy (1904–1905)==

American poet, author, and lecturer Will Carleton was a wealthy friend with whom Crosby had lived in her last years in Brooklyn. He had been giving lectures on her hymns and life, and had published a series of articles about her in his &quot;Every Where&quot; magazine in 1901 (which had a peak circulation of 50,000 copies a month), for which he paid her $10 (~$ in ) an article. In 1902, he wrote a tribute to her that was published in his &quot;Songs of Two Centuries&quot;.
At Knapp&#x27;s instigation, Carleton revised those articles and wrote &quot;Fanny Crosby&#x27;s Life-Story&quot;, a biography which she authorized initially; it was published by July 1903 and reviewed favorably by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on July 25. Carleton&#x27;s book sold for $1 a copy.

This was the first full-length biographical account of Crosby&#x27;s life, although Robert Lowry had written a 16-page biographical sketch that was published in 1897 in her last book of poems &quot;Bells of Evening and Other Verses&quot;. In the advertisement at the front of the book, the following statement from &quot;the author&quot; was signed with a facsimile of Crosby&#x27;s signature: &quot;&#x27;Fanny Crosby&#x27;s Life-Story&#x27; is published and sold for my benefit, and I hope by its means to be a welcome guest in many homes&quot;. Carleton added:

===Publishers&#x27; reaction===
According to Ruffin, Carleton&#x27;s book &quot;went over like a lead balloon with Fanny&#x27;s publishers.&quot; There was nothing negative written explicitly about Biglow and Main, but there was also little praise for the firm and its members. Crosby is quoted, referring to Biglow and Main: &quot;with whom I have maintained most cordial and even affectionate relations, for many years past&quot;. The book did not use any of her hymns that were owned by Biglow and Main. Hubert Main believed that &quot;Will Carleton wanted to ignore the Biglow &amp; Main Company and all its writers as far as possible and set himself up as the one of her friends who was helping her&quot;. Biglow and Main believed that Carleton and Phoebe Knapp were guilty of &quot;a brutal attack on Fanny&quot;, and that they were plotting to &quot;take over&quot; Crosby. Knapp was not invited to the 40th anniversary reception and dinner held in Manhattan in February 1904 to celebrate Crosby&#x27;s association with Bradbury and Biglow and Main; according to Blumhofer, she was &quot;persona non grata&quot; at Biglow and Main.

Biglow and Main were concerned that the book would diminish sales of Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Bells at Evening and Other Verses&quot;, which they had published in 1897 and which contained Lowry&#x27;s biographical sketch of Crosby. They convinced Crosby to write to both Carleton and Knapp, and to threaten to sue Carleton in April 1904. The threatened lawsuit was to obtain information regarding sales of the book, for which she had been promised a royalty of 10 cents per copy, and to seek an injunction preventing further publication. The proposed injunction was on the grounds that she had been misrepresented by Carleton; she believed that he had described her as living alone in poor health and extreme poverty, when in fact she was receiving $25 a week from Biglow and Main and was living with relatives who cared for her. Crosby indicated she had no desire to be a homeowner, and that if she ever lived in poverty, it was by her own choice.

===Controversy goes public===
In response to Crosby&#x27;s letter and threats, Carleton wrote in a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he was motivated to write his &quot;labor of love&quot; for Crosby in order to raise money that she might have a home of her own for the first time in her life. He stated that he had:
*interviewed Crosby and transcribed the details of her life
*paid her for her time and materials
*secured her permission to publish the material in his magazine &quot;Every Where&quot; and in a book
*paid all the expenses for publishing and printing out of his own pocket
*promoted the book in his own time and at his own expense
*remitted $235.20 to her for the royalties owing for the previous eight months at the agreed rate
*sent her additional contributions given by admirers at his lectures
Sankey paid the rent on the Bridgeport house where Crosby lived with her half-sister Carrie. He implied in an article in &quot;The Christian&quot; that &quot;the Carleton business had been of Satanic origin and commented, echoing the wheat and tares passage in scripture, &#x27;An enemy hath done this&#x27;&quot;.

In 1904, Phoebe Knapp contacted Methodist Episcopal Church Bishop Charles Cardwell McCabe and enlisted his assistance in publicizing Crosby&#x27;s poverty, raising funds to ameliorate that situation. They secured Crosby&#x27;s permission to solicit funds for her benefit, and the religious press (including &quot;The Christian Advocate&quot;) carried McCabe&#x27;s request for money on her behalf in June 1904, under the heading &quot;Fanny Crosby in Need&quot;. McCabe indicated that Crosby&#x27;s &quot;hymns have never been copyrighted in her own name, she has sold them for small sums to the publishers who hold the copyright themselves, and the gifted authoress has but little monetary reward for hymns that have been sung all over the world&quot;.

By July 1904, newspapers reported that Crosby&#x27;s publishers had issued a statement denying that she was in need of funds, indicating that she never would be, &quot;as they have provided abundantly for her during her entire life&quot;, and stating that &quot;Bishop McCabe ... has been grossly deceived by somebody&quot;.

Crosby also wrote a letter to Bishop McCabe in response to his fundraising on her behalf. This letter was published at her instigation, permitting him to solicit funds from her friends as &quot;a testimonial of their love&quot;, but reiterating that she was not living in poverty, nor was she dying or in poor health. Crosby and her representatives contacted him a week later, and McCabe wrote to &quot;The Christian Advocate&quot; explaining his rationale for raising funds for her, but stating that he was withdrawing the appeal at her request.

The matter was still not settled in July 1904; however, it came to an end before Fanny Crosby Day in March 1905 after Carleton&#x27;s wife Adora died suddenly.

===New Carleton edition===
In 1905 Carleton issued a new edition of &quot;Fannie Crosby, Her Life Work&quot;, which was both expanded and &quot;newly illustrated&quot;, and despite &quot;the greater expense of production, the price remains One Dollar a copy&quot;, with Crosby to &quot;receive the same liberal royalty&quot;, as the book was &quot;&quot;.

In December 1905 Crosby issued a card protesting the continued sale of Carleton&#x27;s book, again denying she was &quot;in distress&quot;, as she was in &quot;comfortable circumstances and very active&quot;, giving lectures nearly once a week. She indicated she had received less than $325 from the sale of the book, that her &quot;requests had been disregarded&quot;, but that &quot;when these facts are fully known to all, the publishers can sell the book as they desire; only I have no wish to increase its sale for my own benefit, which, of course, is very small&quot;.

Despite Crosby&#x27;s efforts, Carleton continued to advertise the book for sale until at least 1911. In 1911, Carleton serialised and updated Crosby&#x27;s life story in &quot;Every Where&quot;. The 1906 publication of Crosby&#x27;s own autobiography, &quot;Memories of Eighty Years&quot;, which, in contrast to Carleton&#x27;s book, focused on Crosby&#x27;s hymn-writing years, was sold by subscription and door-to-door, and promoted in lectures by Doane, raised $1,000 for Crosby. For a period Crosby and Knapp were estranged because of the Carleton book, but by early 1905 they had reconciled.
==Death and legacy==
Crosby died at Bridgeport of arteriosclerosis and a cerebral hemorrhage on February 12, 1915, after a six-month illness, aged 94. She was buried at Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport, CT near her mother and other members of her family. Her family erected a very small tombstone at her request which carried the words: &quot;Aunt Fanny: She hath done what she could; Fanny J. Crosby&quot;.

Crosby said that her interest in &quot;public affairs has never abated. There are not many people living in this year of grace who had the privilege of meeting such statesmen as Henry Clay, General Scott, and President Polk, but the names of these heroes are recorded with indelible letters among the annals of our national history, and their imperishable deeds are chronicled in characters that no person living should wish to efface. They were men of sterling worth and firm integrity, of whom the rising generation may well learn wisdom and the true principles of national honor and democracy that all of them labored so faithfully to inculcate. ...&quot;

===Fanny Crosby Day===
On Sunday, March 26, 1905, Fanny Crosby Day was celebrated in churches of many denominations around the world, with special worship services in honor of her 85th birthday two days earlier. On that day, she attended the First Baptist Church in Bridgeport where Carrie Rider was a member; she spoke in the evening service and was given $85.

In March 1925, about 3,000 churches throughout the United States observed Fanny Crosby Day to commemorate the 105th anniversary of her birth.

===Fanny Crosby Memorial Home for the Aged (1925–1996)===
Crosby left money in her will for &quot;the sheltering of senior males who had no other place to live, with these men to pay a nominal fee to the home for their living expenses&quot;. In 1923, the King&#x27;s Daughters of the First Methodist Church of Bridgeport, Connecticut honored Crosby&#x27;s request to memorialize her by beginning to raise the additional funds needed to establish the Fanny Crosby Memorial Home for the Aged. The non-denominational home was established in the former Hunter house at 1008 Fairfield Avenue, Bridgeport; it opened on November 1, 1925, after a national drive by the Federation of Churches to raise $100,000 to operate it. It operated until 1996 when it was given to the Bridgeport Rescue Mission.

The Enoch Crosby chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated a historic roadside marker on October 8, 1934, commemorating her birthplace on the western side of Route 22 in Doansburg, New York, just north of Brewster.

A large memorial stone was dedicated on May 1, 1955, by Crosby&#x27;s &quot;friends to whom her life was an inspiration&quot;—a stone that &quot;dwarfed the original gravestone&quot;—despite her specific instructions not to erect a large marble monument. It contained the first stanza of &quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;.

===Other honors===
Crosby was posthumously inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 1975. Known as the &quot;Queen of Gospel Song Writers&quot;, During 2010 songwriter George Hamilton IV toured Methodist chapels celebrating Fanny&#x27;s outstanding contribution to gospel music. His presentation included stories of her productive and charitable life, some of her hymns, and a few of his own uplifting songs. While she is not mentioned in The Hymnal 1982, her hymns are included in several more recent hymnals, including &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing II&quot; and the &quot;African American Heritage Hymnal&quot;.

<doc id="570795" wikidata="Q2341338" url="?curid=570795" title="Quilling">
<text>Quilling is an art form that involves the use of strips of paper that are rolled, shaped, and glued together to create decorative designs. The paper shape is manipulated to create designs on their own or to decorate other objects, such as greetings cards, pictures, boxes, or to make jewelry.

==History==

Quilling - also known as paper-rolling, or paper scrolling - has a long and interesting history. The origins of quilling are not recorded, but some think it began with the invention of paper, in China in 105 AD or in Egypt, where some tombs have been found to contain wire shapes similar in appearance to modern quilling.
It is believed that in the 300s and 400s, silver and gold wires were quilled around pillars and vases, and jewelry made using this technique. Quilling was practised by Greeks who used thin metal wires to decorate containers and boxes. The earliest works ever were from the medieval period. Also they were found in religious houses across Europe.

With many nationalities claiming the origins of the craft of quilling, it is almost impossible to determine which one invented it. In the 13th century, metal filigree was used for decoration in many countries. But when traditional materials became scarce and unobtainable to the layperson, the paper was used as a substitute. 

In England, with the appearance of first paper mills around 1495, the establishment of paper manufacturing was significant factor in the development of quill work. Paper, elaborately constructed into design and then gilded, substituted for more expensive metal. 

There are records of French and Italian nuns using the torn edges of gilt-edged Holy books from 1200s - 1600s. These pieces were wrapped around goose quills to create coiled shapes for decoration of reliquaries and holy pictures. They used paper and then gilded or painted the finished work replicating expensive intricacies of wrought iron or carved ivory. This practice of using quills resulted in the craft&#x27;s name - quilling.
Many sources claim that in Europe the ladies of affluence were taught quilling along with the needle work in Edwardian and Victorian times. Special recesses were made in tea caddies, baskets, portraits, screens and even in furniture sides to allocate the surface for intricate paper coils and shapes. The instructions and templates were published in magazines of the time. The quality of quilling was at its highest standard. 

These were mostly genteel women in Europe, and particularly in England, where quilling was seen as a proper hobby for young ladies to take up along with needlework. It flourished among the ladies of upper classes who had no need for gainful work and were spared domestic chores. 

Quilling guild of England makes references to The New Lady&#x27;s Magazine of 1786: &quot;... it affords an amusement to the female mind capable of the most pleasing and extensive variety; and at the same time, it conduces to fill up a leisure hour with an innocent recreation ..:&#x27; Another source, an Edwardian book of household management entitled &#x27;Floral Mosaicon,&#x27; provided a reference to Queen Mary and Queen Alexandra purchasing paper pieces. 

Only those with money could afford to purchase the supplies needed for quilling such as foil, mica or flaked shell, which were often used as backgrounds. Wooden frames were sold for the sole purpose of being decorated with pieces of paper rolled, shaped and glued into patterns. The projects were usually finished by painting or gilding. The ladies were to use quilling to while away their hours in the pursuit of becoming accomplished women, comfortable knowing that in time, an eligible bachelor would likely take them as a wife. Quilling thereby became a means of signaling wealth and leisure time to prospective husbands.

Until then they decorated screens, cabinets, frames, tea caddies, cribbage boards, wine coasters, work baskets and work boxes, urns and over time, even furniture. Certainly the craft was popular in the early 1810s (the Regency period), but its popularity waned soon after. 
In 1875 quilling was reintroduced in Europe by William Bemrose, who produced a kit called &#x27;Mosaicon&#x27; that included a handbook on quilling. But by the beginning of 20th century it was only introduced as part of a school craft education.

Many European museums hold examples of quilled work, and two major exhibitions of quilling have been held in 1927 in London, one reportedly displaying items quilled presumably by Charles I. 

The exhibition of 1988 in New York at the Florian-Papp Gallery presented for exhibition and sale some exquisite examples, mostly of European origin. Patricia Caputo also writes extensively on the revival of quilling in America. She has mentioned the American Quilling Guild, surviving suppliers, exhibitions, and overall growing popularity of the craft in 1970s-1980s. The Quilling guild of England is a very popular organisation across Europe and Australia, staging exhibitions and providing classes extensively in both modern and classic styles of quilling. The British quilling guild staged festivals of the craft across the country since the 1990s, and hopes to have a permanent display of its archives.

The best literary example of quilling as a ladies&#x27; pastime was given in Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;. Lucy Steele, attempting to curry favour with the Middletons, in particular with Lady Middleton, creates a filigree work basket for the Middleton&#x27;s spoilt daughter, Anna-Maria: &quot;Perhaps,&quot; continued Elinor, &quot;if I should happen to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible, I think, for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it.&quot; But later Austen depicts the filigree basket as a waste of time and money because of its useless fragility. (&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, Jane Austen, Chapter 23) 

Many examples of quilled art can be found on cabinets and stands, cribbage boards, ladies&#x27; purses, a wide range of both pictures and frames, work baskets, tea caddies, coats of arms and wine coasters. Storage boxes, larger than most jewelry boxes with drawers and/or tops that opened, quilled lock boxes, are popular. In recent times, quilling jewelry has become a trend for fashion lovers, as it can be very light and easy to carry on them. Some items were specially designed for quilling, with recessed surfaces. Quilling was also combined or married with other techniques such as embroidery and painting.

Today, quilling is seeing a resurgence in popularity. It is sometimes used for decorating wedding invitations, for Christmas, birth announcements, greeting cards, scrapbook pages, and boxes. Quilling can be found in art galleries in Europe and in the United States, and is an art that is practiced around the world.

==Accessibility==
Quilling is relatively easy to learn compared to most other crafts, and with the resources available today, it can be learned by almost everyone. Basic quilling techniques can be learned almost anywhere and there are several videos online that teach how to start quilling. There are more exotic styles of quilling that aren&#x27;t commonly taught, but can be learned through books that teach the specific styles.

==Tools==

=== Slotted tool ===
The &quot;slotted tool&quot; is the most important quilling tool as it makes curling coils much easier and faster. Bird feather quills can be used as slotted tools, and this is where the word &#x27;quilling&#x27; comes from. The quality of the coil is noticeably higher compared to a coil that was curled with a toothpick or hand. For younger children, it is recommended that a Curling Coach be used with the slotted tool.

=== Needle tool ===

The &quot;needle tool&quot; plays a supporting role in the craft. It is used primarily to apply glue to hard-to-reach areas of the coil or quilling design.

=== Tweezers ===

Tweezers are used to make delicate coils to prevent warping and unraveling. They keep the coils the same size which is important when making something with duplicate coils, like flower petals. Tweezers are also helpful in inserting paper in tight spaces.

=== Circle sizer ruler ===

The circle sizer ruler is not essential in making coils into a desired size after curling. The ruler on the side is used to measure each strip to ensure they are the same length before curling.

=== Curling coach ===

Curling coaches make a great complement tool for slotted tools and are recommended for younger kids and people who like to quill 3D miniatures. It makes curling the strips much faster and easier than if they were curled with just the slotted tool.

=== Crimper tool ===
This tool is used to make crimped quilling strips. It helps to create different patterns. It is used to make a zig-zag pattern to the sheet.

==Paper types==
Any type of paper can be used for quilling, however some will last for longer than others. Specialist quilling paper is available on the consumer market in over 250 colors and dimensions. It can be divided into various categories, like solid-colored, graduated, two-tone, acid-free, and other assorted parcels of quilling paper. It is available in various dimensions, such as 1/8”, 1/4” and 3/8&quot; or 3mm, 5mm, 7mm, and 10mm paper parcels, 5mm being the most widely-used size.

Acid-Free

As the name clearly indicates this is a paper that is completely acid-free. The quality makes it an outstanding choice for making scrapbooks, rubber stamping, and creating frames for pictures. It assures your project will last a lifetime, without any side effects on the framed picture or album.

Graduated

This type of paper provides an exceptional look to decorative quilling projects. The edges have a solid color that gradually fades to white. When using a graduated paper, a quilling ring begins with a dark shade but ends up being faded to a lighter side. On the contrary, some graduated papers begin as white, or a lighter shade, and then slowly fades into a solid, darker color.

Two-Tone

This is another important type of quilling paper. It is quite similar to the graduated quilling paper in its use. The look consists of a concrete color on one side and a comparatively lighter color on the other side. With two-tone paper the color remains the same, however, the intensity of the color is different. The main use of this quilling paper is to provide a desired level of softness to the quilled subject. It possesses the capacity to quill many papers in a single spiral.

<text>Buck Godot is the title character in a science fiction/comedy comic book series collected in two volumes (&quot;Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire&quot; and &quot;Buck Godot: PSmIth&quot;) and assorted comic books, including the eight-issue &quot;Gallimaufry&quot; series, all written and drawn by their creator, Phil Foglio.

== Publication history ==
The first Buck Godot story appeared in issue #2 (summer 1982) of the anthology comic book &quot;Just Imagine&quot;, published by Just Imagine Graphix. More Buck Godot stories followed in issues #3 (1982) and #5 (spring 1983). A fourth story written by John J Buckley, Jr. and penciled by Doug Rice, which has never been reprinted, appeared in #8 (winter 1984). In 1986, the three stories by Foglio were colored and compiled along with a new fourth story in &quot;Buck Godot: Zap Gun for Hire&quot;, a graphic novel published by Starblaze Graphics. This was followed in 1987 by a full-length graphic novel, &quot;Buck Godot: PSmIth&quot;, also published by Starblaze.

A single-page Buck Godot story also appeared in &quot;E-Man&quot; #9 (December 1983).

In 1993, Foglio began publishing the 8-issue limited series &quot;Buck Godot - Zap Gun for Hire&quot; through Palliard Press. Six issues were published on a semi-annual basis. After Palliard Press dissolved, the final two issues were published starting in 1997 by Studio Foglio. The series was later collected in a trade paperback as &quot;Buck Godot: The Gallimaufry&quot;.

After successfully moving &quot;Girl Genius&quot; from a printed comic book series to a webcomic in 2006, Studio Foglio began to serialize the existing Buck Godot stories as a webcomic. The webcomic started running on January 9, 2007, and updated three times a week. As of June 2009, the last Buck Godot comic has been posted (except for the second story in the first volume, concerning the Planetary Temperance League and one of Lou&#x27;s employees that featured some nudity and one page story &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; parodies the old Hostess pie ads from E-Man #9, and a lost short story from GASP! magazine) and updates have now ceased. Though this has been offline since sometime in February 2016, along with webcomic republications of &quot;What&#x27;s New with Phil &amp; Dixie&quot; and &quot;MythAdventures&quot;, when Airship Entertainment&#x27;s old website broke down.

Studio Foglio hinted at a possible printed (re-)publication of Godot &quot;in late Spring [2016]&quot;.

==Overview==
Buck&#x27;s adventures take place in a future where humanity has joined an interstellar coalition known as the . Human colonization and exploitation has resulted in the development of various human and mutant sub-species, as well as methods such as terraforming (altering marginally habitable worlds into environments where humans can thrive) and pantropy (genetically altering humans to thrive on marginally habitable worlds). Humanity has also become the custodian of The Winslow, an immortal, indestructible, sentient small fuzzy alligator-like creature that usually doesn&#x27;t do anything more than say &quot;Hi!&quot;, and is highly sought after by other species for various reasons.

However, the chaotic nature of human expansion into space has resulted in two Great Checks: a powerful alien intelligence known as Lord Thezmothete, who prevents humans and other species from exploiting pre-spaceflight civilizations; and the emergence of the Law Machines, intelligent robots that enforce the law in all places. The Law Machines always enforce the letter of the written law, to the extent that several planets were forced to change governments when corrupt or neglectful officials were arrested en masse. Since someone arrested by the Law is never seen again, human colonies are wary about accepting the presence of a Law Machine in their society.

The Law&#x27;s presence and methods have led to a noticeable decline in &quot;real governments&quot;, because they tend not to be able to function in the harsh scrutiny of The Law. In their place have risen guilds like X-Tel, which specialize in helping disgruntled colonists move and resettle to places where The Law has a weaker presence.

The sole exception to the Law&#x27;s jurisdiction is the colony of New Hong Kong. The planetary government there wound up being protected from the &#x27;protection&#x27; of the Law Machines when a hacker entered a new &#x27;law&#x27; to be voted into place (and it was, overwhelmingly): &quot;There shall be no laws on New Hong Kong&quot;. The hacker was subsequently arrested, but since the Law Machines are programmed not to interfere in society except when enforcing official laws, they became powerless to act on New Hong Kong thanks to this new (and only) &#x27;law&#x27;. The planet had already been a haven to many of the worst criminals and other anti-social humans and aliens, and has become even more so now that it offers safety from the Machines (the Law Machine assigned to New Hong Kong &quot;moonlights as its conscience&quot;).

New Hong Kong is the home base of the series&#x27; eponymous protagonist, Buckminster &quot;Buck&quot; Godot, a quick-witted mercenary whose motto is &quot;Always available, but never free&quot;. He was once a security chief of the corrupt X-Tel Corporation, but &quot;retired&quot; from their service after an ethical dispute, damaging their headquarters and stealing a starship as he left (in what Godot later cheekily described as &quot;taking his pension in a lump sum&quot;).

Buck mostly hangs around Asteroid Al&#x27;s bar on New Hong Kong, waiting for work to come to him. His normal fee is in the five to six-figure range, plus expenses and sometimes, given the amount of property damage he causes, those expenses can be pretty high. He follows strict ethical standards in all his dealings, which sometimes surprises his clients. One of the mottos of New Hong Kong is, &quot;Just because there are no laws, that doesn&#x27;t mean there are no rules&quot;.

==Powers, abilities and weapons==
Buck Godot is a Hoffmanite, a variant human race from a world with a heavy gravity environment. His rotund appearance conceals high muscular density, giving him incredible (but not quite superhuman) strength, stamina and metabolic endurance (he can drink high amounts of alcohol with little effect). He can also move deceptively quickly and efficiently for a man of his size.

Buck is also a fast thinker, shown setting up and executing very elaborate schemes on short notice. His skills are impressive enough to be worthy of respect by no less than Lord Thezmothete, the single most advanced being in the galaxy.

Buck is an expert marksman, able to shoot his way out of almost any situation. His normal &quot;zap gun&quot; is &quot;Junior&quot;, a white or chromed laser pistol which fires cartridge-loaded energy blasts (a much larger gun, &quot;Senior&quot;, may be glimpsed on his apartment wall). 
He is also an expert pilot, operating small personal craft around New Hong Kong as well as interstellar spacecraft.

==Known associates &amp; antagonists==
Buck&#x27;s best friend is Louisa &quot;Lou&quot; Dem Five, the asteroid-born madam of the Velvet Fist bordello. Lou is a former agent of the Planetary Temperance League, but finds her current profession more to her liking, and has successfully tempted several of her fellow agents to work for her. Her human-variant alteration gives her voluntary control over glands in her body that exude an intensely-powerful pheromone that can entice anyone (at least, anyone with a healthy sex drive). Lou has employed Buck on several occasions, usually surprised that he prefers payment in cash instead of &quot;trade&quot;. Buck&#x27;s response is generally that she is &quot;too small&quot;, a reference to the fact that Hoffmanites are so large, heavy, and strong, once joking that they could have a go if she gained about 400 pounds.

Buck&#x27;s other friend is Asteroid Al, a Thuxian (an eyeless alien species roughly resembling the creatures from the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise), who is known for being stingy about money and contracts. The drinks served at his bar can intoxicate the unwary almost immediately. Buck&#x27;s drink of choice is the &quot;ion sucker&quot;, whose containers also make useful weapons (as well as components for flower arranging). Other cronies at Al&#x27;s Bar include Spug, a frog-faced alien cabbie who has trouble keeping secrets. Beyond these, Buck is a well-known face at Asteroid Al&#x27;s, and indeed throughout most of New Hong Kong.

Buck&#x27;s notable antagonists have included the aforementioned X-Tel Corporation, the human collective mind PSmIth (read as &quot;Smithe&quot;, referencing the &quot;psi&quot; shortening of &quot;psychic&quot;), the high-grade thief and assassin named Der Rock the Destroyer and the notorious space pirate known as the Pistol Packin&#x27; Polaris Packrat (a sentient who has the dubious honor of being the only creature Buck will deal with for free; Al suspects that there&#x27;s someone out there paying Buck to breathe) with his two talking laser pistols, Smith and Wesson, who have some history with &quot;Junior&quot; and lament that he &quot;isn&#x27;t speaking to them&quot;.

In the 8-part &quot;Gallimaufry&quot; series, Buck travels to the eponymous space station – acting as a sort of United Nations in space - and meets a new group of friends, allies, and enemies. These include the Prime Mover, an immortal and omnipotent alien lifeform who has a deal with humanity to prevent their extinction, Ambassador Whreee of the Klegdixal, a paranoid and conniving alien race and oft-time political rival of humanity, Parahexavoctal, chief of security of the entire Gallimaufry, and Buck&#x27;s uncle and fellow Hoffmanite, Frakkus Godot.

<doc id="570808" wikidata="Q352151" url="?curid=570808" title="Kārlis Skrastiņš">
<text>Kārlis Skrastiņš (July 9, 1974 – September 7, 2011) was a Latvian professional ice hockey player. Skrastiņš was drafted by the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League in 1998 as a defenceman and spent twelve years in the league playing for the Predators, the Colorado Avalanche, the Florida Panthers, and the Dallas Stars.

For the 2011-2012 season, Skrastiņš left the NHL and signed a contract to play in Russia for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). However, he never got to play a game for Lokomotiv as he was killed in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash that killed almost the entire team on September 7, 2011.

==Playing career==
Skrastiņš was drafted by Nashville Predators with the 230th pick in the ninth round of 1998 NHL Entry Draft. On October 15, 2002, against the New York Islanders, he scored a 5-on-3 shorthanded goal. He played for Nashville for five seasons until being traded to the Colorado Avalanche in 2003. On February 8, 2007, he played in his 487th consecutive game to pass Tim Horton for the longest playing streak in NHL history for a defenceman. Skrastiņš&#x27; streak ended at 495 games, when he missed a February 25, 2007 game against the Anaheim Ducks with a knee injury. He had previously missed only one other game due to injury in his career — against St. Louis on February 18, 2000, with a minor shoulder injury. The streak led to him being given the nickname &quot;Ironman&quot;.

In his fourth season with the Avalanche in 2007–08, he was traded to the Florida Panthers for Ruslan Salei (who also died in the Lokomotiv plane crash) on February 26, 2008. In his first full season with the Panthers in 2008–09, Skrastiņš scored a career high 18 points in 80 games. On October 16, 2008, he played his 600th career NHL game against the Minnesota Wild and on November 1, 2008, he scored his 100th point in his NHL career in a 3–2 loss fittingly against his original club, the Nashville Predators.

On July 2, 2009, he was signed by the Dallas Stars to a two-year contract worth $2.75 million. He scored his only two goals of the 2009–10 season, including the game winner, on December 19 in a 4–3 Stars victory over the Detroit Red Wings.

On May 17, 2011, after eleven seasons in the NHL, Skrastiņš left to sign a contract with Russian team, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl.

==Death==

Skrastins died on September 7, 2011, when a Yakovlev Yak-42 passenger aircraft, carrying nearly the entire Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team, crashed just outside Yaroslavl, Russia. The team was traveling to Minsk to play their opening game of the season, with its coaching staff and prospects. Lokomotiv officials said &quot;&#x27;everyone from the main roster was on the plane plus four players from the youth team.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Roger Tom Abiut (born 1972) is a Vanuatuan politician. He served as speaker of Parliament of that country and, in that capacity, served as acting president twice in 2004.

== Biography ==
Abiut is a member of the Vanuatu Labour Party. After becoming the Speaker of Parliament in December 2003, he became acting president on March 24, 2004, when the five-year term of President John Bani expired. He served in that position until April 12, when a new president, Alfred Maseng was elected by the parliament and the presidents of the regional councils. Maseng was removed as president on May 11, 2004, and Abiut became acting president again.
Abiut lost his seat in Parliament shortly thereafter, in the parliamentary elections of July 7, 2004, and therefore lost his positions as speaker of parliament and acting President on July 28, 2004, at the first session of Parliament. The Vanuatu Labor Party no longer has any representatives in Parliament.

<doc id="570813" wikidata="Q131799" url="?curid=570813" title="Tentaculata">
<text>Tentaculata is a class of comb jellies, one of two classes in the phylum Ctenophora. The common feature of this class is a pair of long, feathery, contractile tentacles, which can be retracted into specialised ciliated sheaths. In some species, the primary tentacles are reduced and they have smaller, secondary tentacles. The tentacles have colloblasts, which are sticky-tipped cells that trap small prey.

Body size and shape varies widely. The group includes the small, oval sea gooseberries found on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The more flattened species of the genus &quot;Mnemiopsis&quot;, about long, are common on the upper Atlantic coast; it has a large mouth and mainly feeds on larval molluscs and copepods. This species is brilliantly luminescent. The similar, but larger, genus &quot;Leucothea&quot; is abundant on the Pacific coast. Venus girdle (genus &quot;Cestum&quot;) is a flattened, ribbon-like form reaching over in length, and found in tropical waters.

<text>Econoline Crush is a Canadian rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, formed in 1992. They have released five studio albums and three studio EPs, and are best known for their charting singles such as &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What It&#x27;s Like&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Surefire (Never Enough)&quot;, &quot;All That You Are (X3)&quot;, &quot;Make It Right&quot;, and &quot;Dirty&quot;. They achieved platinum status with the 1997 album &quot;The Devil You Know&quot; and also received two Juno nominations, in 1995 for &quot;Purge&quot; and in 1998 for &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;.

Vocalist Trevor Hurst has been the only consistent member of the band since its formation.

==Band history==
===Formation, &quot;The Purge Demo&quot;, &quot;Purge&quot;, and &quot;Affliction&quot; (1992–1996)===
Econoline Crush was formed in early 1992 when singer Trevor Hurst moved to Vancouver from Seattle after he answered an ad seeking a vocalist in the local Seattle music magazine, &quot;The Rocket&quot;, placed by Chris Meyers. Tom Ferris (previously known for the band Moev) and Meyers had been advertising and searching for a vocalist before Hurst contacted Meyers from Seattle. The trio began writing demos alongside guitarist Robbie Morfitt and bassist Dan Yarmeko. Initially, Ferris wanted to name the band &quot;Crush&quot;, but the other members agreed that the name was too common. Hurst then suggested adding &quot;Econoline&quot; to it, taken from a Ford Econoline van; thus, they settled on &quot;Econoline Crush&quot;.

The band self-released an EP in early 1993 titled &quot;The Purge Demo&quot;. Around the same time, Ferris (who had songwriting credits on the next two releases) and Meyers both left the band, and Econoline Crush signed a record deal with EMI Music Canada after playing only 26 shows total. Shortly after, drummer Gregg Leask and guitarist Mike &quot;Hack&quot; Gallagher joined the band.

In 1994, the band released their major label debut, &quot;Purge&quot;, with producer Dale Penner and keyboardist/programmer Rhys Fulber, although Chris Bryant was brought into the lineup as the band&#x27;s keyboardist after the EP&#x27;s release. &quot;T.D.M.&quot; was the only song to be released as a single, and its music video aired sporadically on the television program &quot;MuchOnDemand&quot;. In 1995, the band gained their first nomination for a Juno Award in Canada for &quot;Purge&quot;.

Both Bryant and Hack departed from the band prior to the release of the full-length album &quot;Affliction&quot; on March 21, 1995 (albeit in Canada only). The album was produced by Fulber, and contained the singles &quot;Nowhere Now&quot;, &quot;Wicked&quot;, and &quot;Close&quot;. The band then embarked on an extensive Canadian tour. They also toured Europe three times, with The Young Gods, Die Krupps, and Waltari, culminating in an appearance at the Popkomm Festival in Köln, Germany, with Filter. The album was then released in early 1996 on the band&#x27;s new US label Nettwerk Records. While touring behind the album in the US, they added second guitarist David &quot;Ziggy&quot; Sigmund and keyboardist Adam Percy to the lineup. Towards the end of the year, the band signed with the management group Bruce Allen Talent, and started recording at Sound City with producer Sylvia Massy, who had worked with Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Tool.

===&quot;The Devil You Know&quot; and mainstream success (1997–2000)===
In 1997, Econoline Crush released &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;. They embarked on a tour with KISS, Foo Fighters, Green Day, The Tea Party, and other bands. For the album&#x27;s US release, Econoline Crush departed from Nettwerk Records, and instead signed with Restless Records. The US release occurred in the spring of 1998, and they went again on tour with KISS, Stabbing Westward, God Lives Underwater, among others.

During the recording of the album and after it was released, the lineup had changed numerous times. Eric &quot;Statik&quot; Anest (from the band Collide) briefly contributed keyboards, replacing Percy. Bassist Yaremko left the band during recording to join singer-songwriter Bif Naked and then rejoined late in the touring cycle (with Don Binns, Ken Fleming, and then Thom Christiansen filling in). Drummer Leask left the band towards the end of the &quot;Affliction&quot; tours. He was at first replaced by Marc Villeneuve, and then Robert Wagner became the band&#x27;s drummer during the album&#x27;s recording sessions (only to be replaced himself by Nico Quintal and then Johnny Haro during the tours). Also, guitarist Morfitt was briefly in the band alongside Sigmund, but Morfitt left after the touring ended for &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;.

The single &quot;All That You Are (X3)&quot; charted highly in both the US (No. 18 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Mainstream Rock chart) and Canada (No. 12 on RPM&#x27;s Hot 100 chart and No. 9 on RPM&#x27;s Alternative 30 chart). The singles &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Surefire (Never Enough)&quot; had also found moderate airplay in both countries. The band received their second Juno nomination in 1998 due to &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, and performed live at the televised Juno ceremony. The album also received gold and platinum awards. In December 1999, Econoline Crush contributed &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What It&#x27;s Like&quot; to MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;Big Shiny Tunes 4&quot; compilation. It was released as a successful single shortly after, as overall it had peaked at No. 13 on RPM&#x27;s Alternative 30 chart and at No. 29 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot Mainstream Rock chart (it was also re-released in 2001 to support the next album).

During this time, some of the band&#x27;s songs appeared on television shows, including &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;Psi Factor&quot;. Econoline Crush also physically appeared in an episode of &quot;The Crow: Stairway to Heaven&quot;, a TV show that was filmed in the band&#x27;s home city of Vancouver. In addition, the 1999 Sony PlayStation game &quot;Sled Storm&quot; featured remixed versions of the songs &quot;Sparkle and Shine&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Now&quot;, and &quot;Surefire (Never Enough)&quot;.

===&quot;Brand New History&quot; and hiatus (2001–2005)===
The band went to California to work on their next album with producers John Travis, Bob Rock, and DJ Swamp, which included collaborations with Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails/Die Warzau) and Paul Raven (Killing Joke/Prong). In 2001, the band released &quot;Brand New History&quot; to mixed reviews, despite some moderate commercial success. The lineup was solidified with Hurst, Yaremko, Sigmund, and Haro, alongside second guitarist Mark Peterson late in the touring cycle. The album contained the charting single &quot;Make It Right&quot; and the previously released &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know What It&#x27;s Like&quot;.

Across Canada, Econoline Crush and rapper Kardinal Offishall supported Godsmack on a tour; however, both openers were not warmly received by the heavy metal crowd. In the middle of 2002, the band&#x27;s US label Restless Records was purchased by Rykodisk, which was already undergoing internal restructuring. The mixed reception of their last album, the ill-fated tours, and the eventual lack of label support caused the band to enter an extended hiatus.

The band members focused on other projects. Yaremko rejoined Bif Naked&#x27;s backing band for a brief period, and then had multiple stints with the punk rock band D.O.A.. Haro teamed up with Stabbing Westward vocalist Christopher Hall to form The Dreaming. Sigmund embarked on a solo career and later moved to California. Hurst started working on a new band alongside former Collective Soul guitarist Ross Childress, initially called Early Moses; however, due to a legal dispute, it was then changed to simply Hurst. Their sole album, &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, was independently released in 2005.

===Reunion, &quot;Ignite&quot;, and &quot;The People Have Spoken, Vol. 1&quot; (2006–2011)===
In December 2006, Econoline Crush reformed to play sporadic one-off shows, although only Hurst and Yaremko from the previous lineups stayed. Afterwards, Hurst announced on his MySpace page that he was working on a new Econoline Crush record, while the band started touring with Hinder. The lineup shifted multiple times, although it was eventually settled with drummer Brent Fitz, bassist Scott Whalen, guitarist Kai Markus, and Hurst. Hurst and Markus (who had worked with Noise Therapy and Methods of Mayhem) co-wrote the songs for the new album, which was recorded at Radiostar Studios in California (once again with Massy, who worked on &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;, as producer). The album, &quot;Ignite&quot;, was released on January 15, 2008. The singles &quot;Get Out of the Way&quot; and &quot;Dirty&quot; both appeared on RPM&#x27;s Alternative 30 chart in Canada, with the latter peaking at No. 13. Shortly after, the band went on tour with Three Days Grace and Seether. In August 2008, they went on another tour with 3 Doors Down, Staind, and Hinder, followed by a tour with Alice Cooper in September and October 2008. In 2009 the band played at festivals across Canada, including the Halifax Rocks Festival with KISS, on July 18.

In April 2010 it was announced that both Morfitt and Sigmund were back playing guitar. The band embarked on a summer tour in 2010, joined by drummer Greg Williamson and bassist Steve Vincent, both from Alberta&#x27;s Tupelo Honey. EMI then released &quot;Surefire: The Best of Econoline Crush&quot; on December 21, 2010. The compilation focused on material from 1994 to 2001.

The band released their EP &quot;The People Have Spoken, Vol. 1&quot; on April 8, 2011, and it featured Fulber as producer for the first time since 1995&#x27;s &quot;Affliction&quot;. Afterwards, Morfitt left the band again.

===Sigmund&#x27;s death, &quot;When the Devil Drives&quot;, and future plans (2012–present)===
On September 17, 2017, the band performed during Calgary&#x27;s fifth annual Rally for Recovery Day while also Hurst shared his story of addiction and recovery. It was the third show of a weekend run that introduced drummer Dayvid Swart and guitarist Graham Tuson, while original bassist Yaremko briefly rejoined before being replaced by Troy Zak.

In a Facebook post in August 2019, the band announced new music would be released and shared a trailer for a documentary about Hurst&#x27;s work as a registered nurse, titled &quot;Flatlander&quot;. In 2020, the band shared a new song, a re-working of &quot;Get Out of the Way&quot; from 2008&#x27;s &quot;Ignite&quot; album. Another new song followed, titled &quot;Fight Like the Devil&quot;. Both songs were due to appear on the newest album called &quot;When the Devil Drives&quot; but ended up as one-off singles instead.

On March 8, 2022 Sigmund unexpectedly died. It was initially revealed on Econoline Crush&#x27;s official social media outlets. No cause of death was reported. On May 10, 2023 the band released the single &quot;No Quitter&quot;, slated as the first single for &quot;When the Devil Drives&quot;. Two additional singles were released in 2023 as well, &quot;Invincible&quot; and &quot;Locked in Your Stone&quot;. &quot;When the Devil Drives&quot; was eventually released on October 13, 2023. The album featured the lineup of Hurst, Swart, Zak, and guitarist Dan Garrison. Posthumous songwriting contributions from Sigmund and guitar contributions from Tuson appeared on the album, although Tuson rejoined the band and replaced Garrison around the time of the album&#x27;s release.

<doc id="570817" wikidata="Q496366" url="?curid=570817" title="Beroidae">
<text>Beroidae is a family of ctenophores or comb jellies more commonly referred to as the beroids. It is the only known family within the monotypic order Beroida and the class Nuda. They are distinguished from other comb jellies by the complete absence of tentacles, in both juvenile and adult stages. Species of the family Beroidae are found in all the world&#x27;s oceans and seas and are free-swimmers that form part of the plankton.

==Anatomy==
Some members of the diverse genus &quot;Beroe&quot; may occasionally attain a length of up to , though most species and individuals are less than about 10 cm; &quot;Neis cordigera&quot; is among the largest species in the class, often exceeding in length. The body is melon or cone-shaped with a wide mouth and pharynx and a capacious gastrovascular cavity. Many meridional canals branch off this and form a network of diverticulae in the mesogloea. There are no tentacles but there are a row of branched papillae, forming a figure of eight around the aboral tip.

The sack-like body of the &quot;Beroe&quot; species may be cylindrical in cross section, or compressed to varying amounts according to species, while &quot;Neis&quot; is somewhat flattened and characterized by a pair of trailing gelatinous &quot;wings&quot; that extend beyond the aboral tip.

Like other comb jellies, the body wall of nudans consists of an outer epidermis and an inner gastrodermis, separated by a jelly-like mesoglea. The mesoglea has pigments that give many nudan species a slightly pink color; &quot;Neis cordigera&quot; may be yellowish or a deep orange-red.

=== Mouth opening ===
Some nudans have a very large oral cavity, allowing them to swallow prey whole. While swimming, and particularly while pursuing prey, they close their mouths like a zipper so that they maintain a streamlined profile. The mouth is zipped closed from each end, and the edges seal shut by forming temporary inter-cellular connections. When close to the prey, the lips contract and the mouth is opened rapidly, sucking in the prey. This action is reversible and the lips can be resealed. An alternative method of feeding involves the lips spreading over the prey and the sword-shaped macrocilia lining the lips chopping off chunks. The lips are sealed by the presence of adhesive strips of epithelial cells along their opposite edges. Not all species seem to have these strips which seem specifically adapted to those with wide mouths whereas species with small oral openings are able to control the opening of the aperture by more conventional means.

=== Macrocilia ===
Directly inside the mouth opening, in the lining of the gullet, can be found characteristic finger-like processes known as &quot;macrocilia&quot;. These were first described by J.G.F. Will in 1844 and further investigated by George Adrian Horridge in 1965. He found they were complex structures composed of 2,000 to 3,000 filaments in a single, conical functional unit. Each macrocilium shows the typical eukaryote construction of nine external and two internal microtubules. The individual macrocilium is between 50 and 60 micrometres long and 6 to 10 micrometres thick, with the cilia bonded together in a hexagonal cross-sectional structure by permanent fibrils in three different planes. A system of tubules connects the basal bodies from which the macrocilia grow.

The macrocilia move in unison. They are angled towards the gullet and are stacked on top of each other like roof tiles. By this arrangement they effectively grip parts of the prey in synchronized waves like a conveyor belt, transporting it to the stomach, and the throat muscles promote this process. The three-toothed tip of the macrocilia is stiff enough for it to rip the outer wall of larger prey such as other ctenophores; at the same time, proteolytic enzymes penetrate into the resulting wounds, rapidly incapacitating the victim.

Macrocilia also function as teeth, and can be used in the same way as the tentacles of Tentaculata.

=== Channel system ===
As in other ctenophores, from the main stomach a network of channels branch through the mesogloea. Some of these have blind ends and others link up. They supply nutrients to the most active parts of the animal, the mouth, pharynx, combs of cilia and the sensory organs at the hind end of the body. Each comb plate has its own meridional canal situated directly beneath it and a ring of channels surround the mouth.

=== Sensory organs and combs ===
At the aboral end of the animal (the opposite end from the mouth) is a statocyst, a balance organ that helps it to orient itself. Papillae surround the statocyst. Their function is unclear, but they are probably also used for sensory perception. The eight combs of cilia extend part way along the body in ribs. The combs are used in locomotion, with the cilia beating in synchronised waves to propel the animal. It usually moves with the mouth end in front, but the direction of movement can be reversed. When not actively moving, a vertical position is maintained, normally with the mouth upwards.

==Diet==
Nudans feed on free swimming animals with soft bodies, primarily on other ctenophores, many of them larger than they are themselves. They actively hunt for prey, which they usually devour whole. Some species use their macrocilia as teeth to remove smaller chunks from their prey.

== As invasive species ==

In the late 1980s the ctenophore species &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot; was introduced into the Black Sea, probably through ballast water, which led to the collapse of the local anchovy population. In 1997 another ctenophore species arrived—&quot;Beroe ovata&quot;, a predator of &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot;. The Beroe population underwent an initial explosion, until the numbers of both ctenophores stabilized. Nevertheless, both &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot; and &quot;Beroe ovata&quot; remain today in the Black Sea. The same phenomenon is occurring at the beginning of the 21st century in the Caspian Sea.

==Reproduction==
All species are hermaphrodites and reproduce sexually, having both female and male gonads. Although no detailed figures are available, it is assumed that self-fertilization is the exception among nudans. The fertilized eggs hatch into miniature versions of the adult animal, rather than distinct larval forms. They lack tentacles and are otherwise similar to the &quot;Cydippea&quot; larvae.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
There are no known fossil nudans, so the phylogenetic evolution of the group by comparison with other modern ctenophores is not possible. In the traditional system, the Nuda form a class distinct from the Tentaculata, which all have at least rudimentary tentacles. This division, after provisional results of morphological and molecular studies, however, probably does not reflect the actual relationships within the ctenophores. The monophyly of Nuda is widely accepted, due to the complete lack of tentacles, and the presence of macrocilia as a common secondary feature, or synapomorphy.

There are approximately 25 species in the family Beroidae, grouped into two genera. The family and order were named in 1825 or 1829 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz.

* The genus &quot;Beroe&quot; includes nearly all the members of the class and is distributed worldwide. One of the best known species, which is widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, is &quot;Beroe gracilis&quot;. In &quot;Beroe&quot; species, the body is usually maintained in a vertical position with the mouth end orientated upwards. The vascular system is separated longitudinally into two separate halves.
* The genus &quot;Neis&quot; is monotypical, containing only one species, &quot;Neis cordigera&quot; (Lesson 1824), and is found only in the waters around Australia. The aboral end is extended into two large lobes and the vascular system is undivided.

<text>Jade Errol Puget (born November 28, 1973) is an American musician and producer, best known as the guitarist for the rock band AFI (joined in 1998), the guitarist/writer for the straight edge hardcore band XTRMST, and the keyboardist/synthesizer operator for the electronic duo Blaqk Audio. Puget is vegetarian and straight edge.

==Career==
Before joining AFI on November 2, 1998, Jade Puget played in various bands, including Loose Change and Redemption 87. His first album with AFI was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot;.

The first song he wrote for the band was &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. Puget&#x27;s addition to the band introduced fans to a more melodically acute and dynamic sound that was vastly different from earlier material.

AFI next released the &quot;All Hallow&#x27;s E.P.&quot; in October 1999, which featured various elements of horror punk and a sound disparate from much of the band&#x27;s earlier material. The EP&#x27;s single was &quot;Totalimmortal&quot;. The song received some airplay on television programs such as MTV2, and was even covered by The Offspring for use in the film &quot;Me, Myself, and Irene&quot;.

The year 2000 saw the release of &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;. The album sold 88,000 copies by March 2002 and the single, &quot;The Days of the Phoenix&quot;, peaked at number 152 on the UK Singles Chart.

After &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;, AFI were signed by the major label DreamWorks Records in 2002. &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;, AFI&#x27;s major label debut, was released in March 2003. The album yielded three singles that found success on the U.S. Alternative Songs chart: &quot;Girl&#x27;s Not Grey&quot; (No. 7), &quot;The Leaving Song Pt. II&quot; (No. 16), and &quot;Silver and Cold&quot; (No. 7). The album was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2006.
&quot;Decemberunderground&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;, was released in June 2006. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling over 182,000 copies in its first week. The single, &quot;Miss Murder,&quot; peaked at No. 1 on the Alternative Songs chart for five weeks and also reached No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album produced the singles &quot;Love Like Winter&quot; (No. 4) and &quot;The Missing Frame&quot; (No. 17). &quot;Decemberunderground&quot; sold over 993,000 copies by 2009.

In 2007, Puget and AFI bandmate Davey Havok released the album &quot;CexCells&quot; as the electronic duo Blaqk Audio. The album reached No. 18 on the Billboard 200 and featured the single &quot;Stiff Kittens&quot;, which peaked at No. 20 on the Alternative Songs chart.

AFI&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Crash Love&quot;, was released in September 2009 and debuted at No. 12 on the Billboard 200. The album produced the two singles: &quot;Medicate&quot;, and &quot;Beautiful Thieves&quot;, which charted at No. 7 and No. 23 on the Alternative Songs Chart, respectively. In the time off after the Crash Love tour, Puget and Havok returned to Blaqk Audio, releasing their second album, &quot;Bright Black Heaven&quot;, made available September 11, 2012.

On October 22, 2013, AFI&#x27;s 9th studio album, &quot;Burials&quot;, was released. In the months prior to the release, two songs were released as singles. The first, &quot;I Hope You Suffer&quot;, was released July 22. The second single, &quot;17 Crimes&quot;, was released August 6. The album received mixed reviews, with the most notable one being from Mike Powell of &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot;, giving the album a meagre 2/5 stars, and commenting that, &quot;&#x27;17 Crimes&#x27; and &#x27;Greater Than 84&#x27; survive with the band&#x27;s flair for camp still intact. Others drown in pools of eyeliner. Flamboyant, serious, plagued by problems he never gets too specific about, Davey Havok invents a role part Morrissey, part Bret Michaels – hair-metal pinup for the Hot Topic era.&quot;

In February 2014, numerous cassette tapes were distributed from record shops in Southern California, titled &quot;XTRMST&quot; and described as &quot;Straight edge hardcore&quot;. In the following weeks, numerous sources leaked rumors that XTRMST was a side project of Puget and Davey Havok. Shortly after, Puget confirmed on his Twitter account that XTRMST was indeed a product of him and Havok.

On October 2, 2014, it was announced the XTRMST would release a full-length LP, available on November 18. The album was made available for purchase either digitally or on vinyl record. Puget has stated that he and Havok had no intent on releasing a full-length record, but the overwhelming positive reaction motivated them to move forward with the project.

==Remixing and production==
Puget remixed Marilyn Manson&#x27;s single &quot;Heart-Shaped Glasses (When the Heart Guides the Hand),&quot; released as an international bonus track from the 2007 album &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot;, and The Cure&#x27;s song &quot;Freakshow&quot; from their 13th album &quot;4:13 Dream&quot;. The remix appears on The Cure&#x27;s 2008 EP &quot;Hypnagogic States&quot;. He remixed Tiger Army&#x27;s &quot;Where the Moss Slowly Grows&quot; off the band&#x27;s album &quot;Music From Regions Beyond&quot;. He did some additional production on The Dear &amp; Departed&#x27;s debut album &quot;Something Quite Peculiar&quot;. Additionally, he remixed Tokio Hotel&#x27;s UK single &quot;Ready, Set, Go!&quot; from their first English album, &quot;Scream&quot;.

Puget did some production work for the band Scarlet Grey on their song &quot;Fancy Blood&quot; on the album of the same name. His remix of The Static Age&#x27;s song &quot;Vertigo&quot; (called &quot;Airplanes&quot;) appeared as a bonus track on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Neon Nights Electric Lives. His remix of Escape the Fate&#x27;s song Issues, for which he used the name Wolves at the Gate, appears on their Issues Remixes EP.
In 2012 he remixed Swedish group Lowe&#x27;s song &quot;Mirage&quot; from the band&#x27;s latest album &quot;Evolver&quot;.

==Personal life==
Puget has a half-sister named Alisha, a half-brother named Gibson, and a younger brother named Smith, who is also AFI&#x27;s tour manager. Gibson appears in the poem in the interlude of &quot;...But Home Is Nowhere&quot; full-length album version &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;.

With straight As throughout his K-12 career, Puget dropped out of school at the age of 17 and continued his education at UC Berkeley, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology in 1996. After graduating from college, Puget joined AFI.

Puget has various tattoos, including an &quot;18&quot; (which was originally a &quot;13&quot;), a cat jumping through a 9 (a tattoo he shares with Nick 13 of Tiger Army and Davey Havok), and the word &quot;committed&quot; arched across his stomach. On his arms, he has the words &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (a homage to The Cure) and the words &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; (a Joy Division tribute). He also has the word &quot;Paprika&quot;, the nickname of his wife, on his arm.

In July 2011, Puget and his girlfriend of six years, Marissa Festa became engaged to be married, and were married on September 22, 2012, in Malibu, California. Their son Ryder Day Puget was born on February 15, 2023.

<text>The Indian Register is the official record of people registered under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; in Canada, called status Indians or &quot;registered Indians&quot;. People registered under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; have rights and benefits that are not granted to other First Nations people, Inuit, or Métis, the chief benefits of which include the granting of reserves and of rights associated with them, an extended hunting season, easier access to firearms, an exemption from federal and provincial taxes on reserve, and more freedom in the management of gaming and tobacco franchises via less government interference and taxes.

==History==
In 1851 the colonial governments of British North America began to keep records of Indians and bands entitled to benefits under treaty. For 100 years, individual Indian agents made lists of members who belonged to each band. In 1951, the current Indian Register was established by amendment of the &quot;Indian Act&quot;, and the many band lists were combined into one.

In 1985, the &quot;Indian Act&quot; was amended again with the goal of restoring First Nations status to people who had lost it through discriminatory provisions of the act, and to their children. Over 100,000 people who had lost their status in this way were added to the register.

==Registration under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; (&quot;Indian status&quot;)==
The list is maintained by Indigenous Services Canada. Sole authority for determining who will be registered is held by the Indian Registrar.

===Revocation of status===
The discriminatory reasons for revoking status were:

* marrying a man who was not registered under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;
* enfranchisement (until 1960, an Indian could vote in federal elections only by renouncing their status as a person who was registered under the Indian Act, i.e. their &quot;Indian status&quot;)
* having a mother and paternal grandmother who were not registered under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; (these people lost status at 21)
* being born out of wedlock of a mother who was registered under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; and a father who was not.

===Documentary proof of Indian status===
Since 1956 the Canadian federal government has issued an identity document to individuals who are registered under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. Traditionally these documents have been used by First Nations people in Canada to cross the border between Canada and the United States under the Jay Treaty. The document is called a certificate of Indian status or secure certificate of Indian status. It is often called a &quot;status card&quot;.

<text>Gateway, Inc., previously Gateway 2000, Inc., was an American computer company originally based in Iowa and South Dakota. Founded by Ted Waitt and Mike Hammond in 1985, the company developed, manufactured, supported, and marketed a wide range of personal computers, computer monitors, servers, and computer accessories. At its peak in the year 2000, the company employed nearly 25,000 worldwide. Following a seven-year-long slump, punctuated by the acquisition of rival computer manufacturer eMachines in 2004 and massive consolidation of the company&#x27;s various divisions in an attempt to curb losses and regain market share, Gateway was acquired by Taiwanese hardware and electronics corporation Acer in October 2007 for US$710 million.

==History==
===1985–1990: Foundation===

Gateway was founded as the TIPC Network by Ted Waitt and Mike Hammond in September 1985. Ted Waitt was the company&#x27;s principal founder; he was later joined by his older brother Norman Waitt, Jr. Before founding the company, Ted Waitt lived on his family&#x27;s cattle farm in Sioux City, Iowa. He had dropped out of two different colleges to work on the farm before landing a job at a computer store in Des Moines, Iowa. After nine months of experience gained on the job, Ted had the idea to start his own computer reselling company that would allow him to sell to niche customers who needed systems in between the lower- and upper-ends of the personal computer market, whose systems were either too limited in terms of speed and memory or too expensive with seldom-used higher-end features. Ted also found that educated salespeople could successfully sell computers to customers completely over the telephone, impressing on him the idea that he could eliminate overhead by having a robust remote salesforce and impressive catalog.

Strapped for cash, however, Ted Waitt took out a $10,000 loan from his grandmother Mildred Smith and occupied the empty upper floor of his father&#x27;s dilapidated cattle brokerage. He was joined by Mike Hammond, Ted&#x27;s coworker who trained the latter to become a computer salesman at their previous job. The duo&#x27;s first products were software and peripherals for Texas Instruments&#x27; Professional Computer home computer, advertised in various computer magazines. The TIPC had been discontinued in the previous year and was largely considered obsolete by 1985. TIPC Network charged their first customers with a membership fee of US$20, in order to flush the company with more start-up capital.

Owing to their products&#x27; very low costs, TIPC earned up to $100,000 in sales within the first four months, beating out many of their competitors in the TIPC aftermarket segment. In early 1986, Ted&#x27;s brother Norman Waitt was hired as TIPC&#x27;s financial advisor in exchange for owning half of the company. That year, the company began selling their own hand-assembled computers locally on an experimental basis. By the end of 1986, TIPC changed their name to Gateway 2000, Inc., and earned $1 million in revenues—the experimental complete computer systems contributing only a small amount to this figure.

Gateway 2000 was inspired to produce computer systems compatible with IBM&#x27;s hugely successful Personal Computer in mid-1987, after Texas Instruments had announced a rebate program allowing customers to trade in their older home computer systems (including the TIPC), in order to contribute toward a $3,500 credit on Texas Instruments&#x27; PC-compatible systems. Feeling that they could offer such computers for half the cost, Gateway 2000 released a complete PC compatible system with dual 5.25-inch floppy drives, ample RAM, a color monitor, and a keyboard, for $1,995 through mail-order. The system was a success for Gateway 2000, with revenue increasing from $1.5 million in 1987 to $12 million in 1988.

The company&#x27;s first computer systems were assembled from parts supplied from other mail-order companies. Instead of hiring computer engineers and industrial designers to devise these products, Gateway 2000 instead relied on Ted Waitt&#x27;s instincts for what customers might appreciate. According to the company, their initial customer base shopped on price alone and rarely made requests for service parts or complex technical support. Because of this, Gateway 2000 maintained a slim overhead, and they were able to price their products below competitors.

In 1988, Gateway 2000 moved their headquarters from the Waitt family ranch to the 5,000-square-foot Livestock Exchange building in downtown Sioux City, for which they paid $350 a month in rent. In the same year, the company launched their first major advertising campaign, taking out a full page advertisement in computer magazines for the first time to advertise the company and its products, putting particular emphasis on their low cost and the company&#x27;s Midwestern United States roots. Waitt described the aim of the tagline “Computers from Iowa with a question mark. Like, who would expect computers from Iowa? You just don’t expect it…And it struck a chord in a time when people were, you know, doing a lot of things different in the industry. You know, so that was the original cow ad.” The campaign was funded with only a small portion of Gateway 2000&#x27;s revenues (2.5 percent) but was very successful nonetheless, the company netting $70.6 million in sales in 1989.

===1990–1995: Early growth===

In January 1990, Gateway 2000 moved their headquarters from Iowa to North Sioux City, South Dakota, in order to take advantage of South Dakota&#x27;s lack of income taxes. The company expanded their advertising campaign that year, producing a number of humorous half- and full-page spreads, featuring employees of the company (including Ted Waitt) in pastoral settings, photographed by a local studio. The company extended the pastoral theme to their shipping containers, which were white with black spots, reminiscent of Holstein cows; this monochrome design scheme also contributed to low costs. Waitt recalled that “The cow spot was actually developed by a graphic designer. I can’t take a claim for that. All I can take claim for it, when I saw it on a box, I said, that is amazing… it was kind of that, no matter where Gateway went, around the world, we took the cow spots. And it was taking that, you know, Iowa values, those Midwestern values with us wherever. It was our symbol.” 

Gateway 2000 posted $275 million in revenues by the end of 1990. Fearing that the company was growing too big for them to handle, the Waitts and Hammond recruited a public accounting firm and poached six executives from rival computer manufacturers to plot the company&#x27;s growth. These executives in turn set up a number of divisions to promote innovation within the company, including a marketing department with five employees, a group dedicated to exploring new technologies with twenty employees, an &quot;Action Group&quot; of ten executives whom Ted Waitt deferred to every two weeks, and a &quot;Road Map Group&quot; to evaluate product development and branding choices. In addition, the company hired a media buyer to handle the company&#x27;s advertising assets advertising and contacts with magazines and other mass media companies.

In the summer of 1991, Gateway 2000 commissioned the construction of a 44,000-square-foot manufacturing plant down the road from its North Sioux City headquarters, expected to increase its manufacturing output by 30 percent. That year, the company also expanded their dealer channels beyond the individual buyer into fleet sales to enterprises. Gateway 2000 offered such corporate clients training programs, troubleshooting literature, and more rigorous customer service. While still a private company at this point, Gateway 2000 elected to release financial results quarterly via press releases in order to project an image of legitimacy among corporate buyers. By 1991&#x27;s end, Gateway 2000 posted $626 million in sales.

Despite the added research and development divisions in 1991, the company admitted to falling behind their competitors in terms of innovation. In an attempt to catch up, Gateway 2000 began segmenting its marketing to appeal to customers with specific needs beyond value and price. For example, the company began offering their desktop computers with the AnyKey, a 124-key keyboard with advanced macro programming for power users and programmers. In 1992, they released the HandBook, a lightweight subnotebook aimed at the executive market. At the end of 1992, the company added 200 people to their support and sales departments, increasing the number of total employees in the company to 1,700. By 1992&#x27;s end, Gateway 2000 reported $1.1 billion in sales. The company had managed to avoid losses during a fierce price war ushered in by Compaq over the summer of 1992, becoming the leading mail-order computer business in the United States.

Gateway 2000 reported their first drop in revenue in the second quarter of 1993, which they attributed to quality control problems reported during the final quarter of 1992 and a stagnant roster of products. To remediate the latter, the company released a notebook with a passive-matrix color LCD and a newer subnotebook. In order to stave off the rise of competitors Dell and IBM in the mail-order market, Gateway 2000 began pursuing markets outside the United States and planned to ramp up their corporate sales by the end of 1993. In service of the latter goal, Gateway 2000 launched a division dedicated to handing major accounts, poaching an executive from IBM to head this division. Gateway&#x27;s technical support staff doubled its headcount to just over 400; Gateway 2000 assigned each of their large corporate customers their own dedicated technical support associate. In October, Gateway 2000 established a European subsidiary in Dublin, Ireland, which staffed a full roster of departments, including manufacturing, sales, marketing, and technical support.

In order to offset the higher-than-expected cost of their corporate sales boost and expansion into Europe, Gateway 2000 announced their plans to go public in October 1993. With their initial public offering the following December, the company raised $163.5 million through selling 10.9 million shares. These shares represented a 15 percent stake in the company; Waitt retained ownership of the other 85 percent of Gateway 2000. Along with financing the aforementioned two initiatives, this infusion of capital also allowed Gateway 2000 to expand its product roster to include networking hardware such as fax modems, peripherals such as printers, and various software products. By the end of 1994, the company employed 5,000 and posted $2.7 billion in revenue.

===1995–2000: Major expansions===

In September 1995, Gateway 2000 commissioned the construction of a manufacturing facility in Hampton, Virginia, worth between $18 million to $20 million and an overseas manufacturing plant in Malaysia to serve computer buyers in East Asia. In August 1995, the company purchased an 80-percent stake in the Australian Osborne retailer, and in the following November, Gateway 2000 established their first website on their first Internet domain, gw2k.com. By the end of the year, Gateway 2000 posted revenues of $3.7 billion.

In 1996, Gateway 2000 introduced the Destination 2000, an early home theater PC that used a large-screen CRT television as its monitor. It was intended for consuming home media content and multimedia software and came with a built-in modem for Internet connectivity. The Destination 2000 sold poorly, and after several months Gateway began offering these systems at retail outlets such as CompUSA at deep discounts.

In March 1997, the company opened up a number of brick-and-mortar retail locations, called Gateway 2000 Country Stores, in various suburbs across the United States. Gateway Country Stores did not stock any of the company&#x27;s products but had a number on display to allow customers hands-on experience with Gateway 2000 computer systems; customers had to order by phone or through the company&#x27;s new website. Their first location was in Tampa, Florida. By 1999, Gateway 2000 had opened up over 140 Country Stores.

In April 1997, Compaq Computer Corporation was in talks to purchase Gateway 2000 to bolster the former&#x27;s presence in the mail order market. The deal was nearly signed, with Gateway set to receive $7 billion, before Waitt vetoed the acquisition that summer. Gateway 2000 themselves acquired two companies in the year, the first being the Amiga Technologies subsidiary of Escom AG, a German company that had filed for bankruptcy in the preceding year. Announced in March 1997, the deal was finalized in the following May, with Amiga International, Inc., incorporated as a subsidiary of Gateway 2000 in South Dakota. Gateway 2000 paid Escom $13 million for the patents to Amiga technologies, the majority of which centered on multimedia capability. In June 1997, Gateway 2000 acquired Advanced Logic Research, Inc., a maker of high-end workstations and servers, in a stock swap valuated at $194 million.

In late 1997, Gateway 2000 began phasing out the use of cows in their branding in an attempt to project a more mature image to their corporate clients. Simultaneously, the company formed Gateway Major Accounts, a subsidiary focused on fleet sales to enterprise clients. By 1997&#x27;s end, the company posted $6.29 billion in revenue and $1 billion in profit.

In 1998, the company began dropping the &quot;2000&quot; from their moniker, as the coming turn of the millennium meant that &quot;Gateway 2000&quot; would soon sound antiquated. The company was formally reincorporated as Gateway, Inc., in May 1999. Also in 1998, Gateway moved their headquarters from South Dakota to La Jolla, San Diego, California—both because Ted Waitt himself wanted to move to California and also to move the company closer to top executive talent at the center of the technology industry. The move was a success in this right, with a new slate of executives hired in 1998, including Jeff Weitzen, a veteran of the AT&amp;T Corporation who was named president and chief operating officer of Gateway.

The new management planned to refocus the company&#x27;s bottom line toward providing information technology services and software, enterprise finance and training, and consumer hardware peripherals, as the market for selling only computer systems had been seeing continually shrinking profit margins. As part of this expansion, Gateway also established their own Internet service provider, Gateway.net, offered exclusively to their customers and competing with the likes of America Online (AOL). Beginning in June 1998, Gateway bundled Netscape Navigator web browser on its systems preinstalled with Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 95 and 98, the latter of which Microsoft themselves bundled with their own web browser, Internet Explorer.

Gateway.net saw slow adoption rates—there were only 200,000 subscribers in early 1999—and was outage-prone. In February 1999, Gateway switched from Web America Networks to MCI WorldCom as their Internet backbone. Also in that month, Gateway began offering one year of free Gateway.net service to those who purchased a Gateway PC worth $1,000 or more. The base of subscribers increased threefold to 600,000 by October 1999 as a result of the promotion. In October 1999, Gateway switched their Internet backbone again to AOL, the latter taking over all operations of Gateway.net in exchange for a $800 million stake in Gateway.

Ted Waitt resigned from his position as CEO of Gateway in December 1999. Weitzen was named president and CEO, while Waitt retained chairman of the board. One of Weitzen&#x27;s first acts as CEO was approving the divestiture of Gateway&#x27;s Amiga International division, selling the corresponding Amiga patents and trademark rights to Amino Development Corporation, who later renamed themselves Amiga, Inc.

===2000–2004: Faltering and consumer electronics===

Coinciding with the Dot-com bubble burst, a global downturn in the personal computer industry at the beginning of 2000 had a major negative impact on Gateway, whose dependence on the worst-hit markets of small business and home office buyers incurred significant quarterly losses. Rival PC maker Dell Computer Corporation had fared better since their main business was centered around corporate clients rather than consumers.

Weitzen laid off many senior managers within the company and broke tradition by selling Gateway&#x27;s conventional personal computers through retailers such as OfficeMax and QVC. A price war instituted by rival Dell Computer Corporation led to Gateway posting a fourth-quarter loss of $94.3 million in 2000. Gateway&#x27;s net profits fell to between $241.5 million and $316 million, while its stock dropped to $18 per share, down from $72 per share.

In the beginning of 2001, Ted Waitt ousted Weitzen and several other executives from the board of directors, reassuming the role of CEO and instigating an extensive restructuring of the company. Waitt shifted the company&#x27;s bottom line away from service and software back to the sale of PCs to consumers and businesses, rehiring a number of executives that had been lost to the executive shuffle of late 1998. Prices of the company&#x27;s computers were massively lowered to make them competitive with offerings from Hewlett-Packard and Dell, while other products, such as the Touch Pad—an Internet appliance that was the result of a joint venture with AOL—were discontinued due to poor sales. Gateway&#x27;s employee base was also cut nearly in half, from 24,600 to 14,000, as part of massive consolidation of the company&#x27;s manufacturing plants, call centers, and Country Stores outlets. The manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Ireland, and Lake Forest, California, were all shuttered; meanwhile most of the company&#x27;s overseas subsidiaries were closed to limit the company&#x27;s business to mainly within the United States. Additionally in 2001, the company moved to Poway, California. By the end of 2001, the company reported a net loss of $1.03 billion, while revenue fell to $5.94 billion.

Gateway&#x27;s sales dropped in 2002 to $4.17 billion, with the number of personal computer system units falling from 3.4 million to 2.75 million. Gateway&#x27;s American market share meanwhile shrunk from 9.3 percent in 1999 to 6.1 percent in 2002. In the beginning of the year, the company laid off 2,250 employees after they had closed 19 Country Stores, a pair of technical support call centers, an Internet sales office, and a research and development laboratory. Gateway reported a net loss of $297.7 million for 2002. In the beginning of 2003, Gateway instituted another restructuring, closing 76 of its 268 Gateway Country stores and laying off 1,900 more employees in the process.

In 2003, Gateway began pivoting toward the sale of consumer electronics, introducing 118 new products across 22 categories. These products included digital cameras, flat-panel television sets, MP3 players, standalone DVD players, home theater PCs with built-in DVRs, and PDAs. The company&#x27;s remaining 192 Gateway Country stores were renovated to accentuate these consumer electronics. Gateway meanwhile attempted to increase its enterprise sales by offering more general-purpose servers and network-attached storage devices. In late 2003, the company shut down its Hampton facility, and restricted the output of the assembly and refurbishing lines of their North Sioux City and Sioux Falls facilities. Manufacturing was moved largely overseas to Taiwan, with OEMs there manufacturing and assembling the parts for Gateway&#x27;s notebooks and desktops. By 2003&#x27;s end, Gateway let go of 1,800 more employees and were down to just 6,900 on their payroll.

Also in late 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed fraud charges against three former Gateway executives: former CEO Jeff Weitzen, former chief financial officer John Todd, and former controller Robert Manza. The lawsuit alleged that the executives engaged in securities violations and misled investors about the health of the company. Weitzen was cleared of securities fraud in 2006; however, Todd and Manza were found liable for inflating revenue in a jury trial which concluded in March 2007.

===2004–2007: eMachines acquisition and consolidation===
In January 2004, Gateway announced that it had signed an agreement to buy computer manufacturer eMachines of Irvine, California, for $30 million in cash and 50 million shares of stock in Gateway. eMachines was founded six years earlier as a joint venture between TriGem, Korea Data Systems, and Sotec; by 2003, it had raked in $1.1 billion in sales and became the third-largest seller of personal computers in the United States while only employing 140 people total in its corporate offices.

By the time the acquisition was finalized in March, eMachines&#x27; payout increased to nearly $300 million, and as a result of the acquisition, Gateway reclaimed the number three spot among American PC manufacturers and the eighth largest PC manufacturer globally. The president and CEO of eMachines, Wayne Inouye, replaced Tedd Waitt as CEO, the latter remaining chairman. A month later, the company announced that it would relocate to Orange County, California (where eMachines had been located); that it would shutter the remaining Gateway Country Stores—laying off 2,500 employees in the process; and that it would begin selling personal computers through third-party retailers, as eMachines had done in the past. Gateway reduced another 1,000 jobs from their manufacturing and technical support facilities in Iowa and South Dakota by the end of the year. By this point, the company only employed 4,000.

Inouye left Gateway in February 2006, by which point the company employed roughly 1,800—down from 7,500 at the start of his tenure. In fall 2006, Gateway briefly revitalized its United States manufacturing presence with the opening of the Gateway Configuration Center in Nashville, Tennessee. It employed over 300 people in that location to assemble build-to-order desktops, laptops, and servers.

===2007–present: Purchase by Acer===

In August 2007, Acer Inc. of Taiwan announced the acquisition of Gateway, Inc., for a US$710 million tender offer. The acquisition was finalized in October 2007. In the interim, MPC Corporation announced that it had signed a deal to acquire Gateway&#x27;s Professional Services Unit—which manufactured and designed the company&#x27;s servers, network-attached storage devices, and workstations—for approximately $90 million. This MPC deal was also finalized in October 2007.

Following the acquisition, Acer used both Gateway and eMachines as sub-brands for several years. Many of Acer&#x27;s most popular lines of personal computers, including netbooks, were rebadged as Gateway machines for midrange consumers, while the eMachines line was kept for budget consumers. In 2013, the company discontinued the eMachines brand, citing the proliferation of tablet computers and 2-in-1 laptops among the lowend computer market. They continued selling computers under the Gateway and Packard Bell brands — the latter being one of Gateway&#x27;s former rival computer manufacturers, until it became a sister trademark after Acer acquired it in 2008. Soon afterward, however, the Gateway brand was also discontinued.

In September 2020, Acer revived the Gateway branding on laptops and tablets sold exclusively through Walmart. Acer commissioned Bmorn Technology, a Shenzhen-based technology company, to manufacture and sell these Gateway branded laptops. The new line of laptops is a rebadging of Walmart&#x27;s existing EVOO-branded laptops. The laptops&#x27; sound systems are tuned in partnership with THX.

<text>The State University of New York College of Optometry (SUNY Optometry) is a public school of optometry in New York City. SUNY Optometry is home to one of the largest optometric outpatient facilities in the nation, and is recognized as one of the leading optometric education and vision research centers in the world.

The college was established in 1971 by Governor Nelson Rockefeller and is part of the State University of New York System, the largest comprehensive university system in the United States. SUNY Optometry is the only school of optometry in the New York tri-state area, and the only optometry school within 100 miles of America&#x27;s most populous city, New York.

== History ==
SUNY Optometry began in 1910 as the Columbia University School of Optometry, which was the first university-based optometry program in the United States. At the time, optometry was mainly eyewear sales and not a true medical profession. By 1928, the New York Stare saw the benefit of Columbia&#x27;s program and passed a bill allowing only graduates of a university-affiliated school of optometry to qualify for the state board exam. This set the stage for nationwide recognition of optometry as a true medical profession.

In 1956, Columbia&#x27;s optometry program shuttered due to not wanting to advance their current bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees into a Doctor of Optometry degree, as many other institutions had done at that time. This closure left a void in New York and the entire region, and as a response, a group of Columbia optometrists and philanthropists came together to form the nonprofit, the Optometric Center of New York (OCNY) in 1956. OCNY served as an eye care clinic and continuing optometric education center after the optometry program at Columbia closed.

After over a decade of lobbying by OCNY, Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed a bill on April 14, 1971, that officially established the State University of New York College of Optometry. Dr. Alden Haffner became the founding president.

In 1972, SUNY Optometry moved into 122 East 25th St. where the OCNY has been operating a clinic for many years. That year, the college took over OCNY&#x27;s educational, clinical, and vision research programs, firmly establishing itself as a major hub for vision science and education.

In 1974, the college established an in-house vision therapy residency. This was the first optometric residency program in the country and the third to receive accreditation status. In 2003, the name of the program was changed to the Dr. Irwin B. Suchoff Residency Program in Vision Therapy and Rehabilitation to honor Dr. Suchoff who was the program&#x27;s first residency supervisor in 1975 and the nation&#x27;s first Director of Residency Education.

In 1975, the inaugural class of SUNY Optometry graduated, with 17 students receiving their degrees.

As the college continued to expand, the need for more space became apparent. In 1976, the college moved to 100 E 24th St. where it would remain until 1999.

In 1999, the college moved to its current campus across from Bryant Park in what was originally the Aeolian Building, which was built in 1912 for the Aeolian Company, a piano manufacturer. The building is where music composer George Gershwin debuted one of his most famous works, Rhapsody in Blue, on February 12, 1924. SUNY Optometry commemorated the 100th anniversary of Rhapsody in Blue with a special performance of the work on February 12, 2024.

In 2024, the Optometric Center of New York (OCNY) was renamed The SUNY College of Optometry Foundation to better align with the organization&#x27;s mission of support eye care, vision research, and optometric education though the work of SUNY Optometry and the University Eye Center.

== Academics ==
The State University of New York College of Optometry is authorized to operate by the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York. The college is regionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). Its professional and residency education programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council on Optometric Education.As of 2024, there were 409 postgraduate students enrolled and 41 residents. The college holds very high standards with over 97% of students passing all three parts of their national board exams before graduation and over 2,400 hours of clinical experience for each student.

The college grants a professional degree, the Doctor of Optometry (O.D.), and two academic degrees, the Master of Science (M.S.) in Vision Science and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Vision Science. Continuing education courses for practicing optometrists are also provided by the college.

An MBA in business management or healthcare leadership is available through a joint program with SUNY Empire State University. This program is open to students enrolled in the O.D. program and graduated O.D.s.

The college offers residencies to optometrists from around the world through 16 clinical residency programs including specializations in cornea and contact lenses, ocular disease, primary care optometry, pediatric optometry and vision rehabilitation.

Research and graduate programs at the college are administered through the Graduate Center for Vision Research, which currently receives nearly $4 million in annual funding for research grants. Current research at the college includes molecular and cellular biology, genetics, ocular structure and function, visual neuroscience, eye movements, neural plasticity, visual psychophysics, eye development, neuroprotection, accommodation and refractive error, and models of ocular pathology.

The University Eye Center (UEC) is the patient-care facility of the State University of New York College of Optometry and is one of the largest eye-and-vision care clinics in the country examining more than 60,000 patients annually and over 240,000 patient encounters. The UEC provides eye care, corrective lenses, and vision therapy to the public.

<text>In Judaism, a minyan ( &quot;mīnyān&quot; , lit. (noun) &quot;count, number&quot;; pl. &quot;mīnyānīm&quot; ) is the quorum of ten Jewish adults required for certain religious obligations. In more traditional streams of Judaism, only men 13 and older may constitute a minyan; the minimum of 10 Jews needed for a meeting has its origin in Abraham&#x27;s prayer to God in . The minyan also has its origin in judicial structure of ancient Israel as Moses first established it in Exodus 18:25 (i.e., the &quot;rule of the 10s&quot;). This we find reiterated in Cyrus Adler’s and Lewis N. Dembitz’s “Minyan,” &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, stating: &quot;The minimum of ten is evidently a survival in the Synagogue from the much older institution in which ten heads of families made up the smallest political subdivision. In Ex. xviii. Moses, on the advice of Jethro, appoints chiefs of tens, as well as chiefs of fifties, of hundreds, and of thousands. In like manner there were the decurio among the Romans and the tithingman among the early English.&quot;

The most common activity requiring a &quot;minyan&quot; is public prayer. Accordingly, the term &quot;minyan&quot; in contemporary Judaism has taken on the secondary meaning of referring to a prayer service.

==Sources==
The source for the requirement of &quot;minyan&quot; is recorded in the Talmud. The word &quot;minyan&quot; itself comes from the Hebrew root meaning to count or to number. The word is related to the Aramaic word &quot;mene&quot;, numbered, appearing in the writing on the wall in .

Babylonian Talmud

The Babylonian Talmud (Megillah 23b) derives the requirement of a &quot;minyan&quot; of ten shomer Shabbat for Kiddush Hashem and &quot;Devarim she-Bikdusha&quot;, &quot;matters of sanctity&quot;, by using the rule of gezerah shavah to link three verses based on shared word-choice:

The word &quot;midst&quot; in the verse:

And I shall be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel 

also appears in the verse:

Separate yourselves from the midst of the congregation 

The term &quot;congregation&quot; is also used in another verse that describes the ten spies (of a total of twelve) who brought back a negative report of the Land of Israel:

How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me? 

From this combination, the Talmud concludes that &quot;sanctification&quot; should occur in the &quot;midst&quot; of a &quot;congregation&quot; of ten.

Jerusalem Talmud

The Jerusalem Talmud (Megillah 4:4) offers two sources for the requirement, also using a gezerah shavah:

The word &quot;congregation&quot; in the verse:

Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them: You shall be holy 

is also used in another verse:

How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me? 

Since the term &quot;congregation&quot; in the later verse refers to the ten spies, so too in the former verse: &quot;You shall be holy&quot; refers to a &quot;congregation&quot; of ten.

The second source is based on the term &quot;children of Israel&quot; which appears in the following two verses:

And I shall be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel 

And the children of Israel came to buy among those that came 

Just as the &quot;children of Israel&quot; in the later verse refers to the ten sons of Jacob who descended to Egypt to obtain food during the famine, so too the former verse refers to sanctification among the “children of Israel” in the presence of ten.

==Rituals requiring a &quot;minyan&quot;==
Some rituals require a minyan; the presence of a rabbi (a teacher, not a priest) is not essential—it is said that &quot;nine rabbis do not constitute a minyan, but ten cobblers can&quot;.

The following instances which require a minyan are listed in the Mishnah in Megillah (4:3):

* Public worship, which consists of the additional readings of &quot;Kaddish&quot;, &quot;Barechu&quot;, &quot;Kedusha&quot; and the Repetition of the Amidah. The minor tractate Soferim contains a passage (10:7) often interpreted as asserting that in Land of Israel at that time seven men were allowed to hold public services. Correctly interpreted it refers to the repeating of &quot;Kaddish&quot; and &quot;Barechu&quot; at the synagogue for the benefit of late comers, and declares that in Israel such a repetition is permitted only when seven (according to others, when six) men are present who have not yet heard these responsive readings.
* The priestly blessing.
* Reading from the Torah and Prophets with the associated benedictions.
* Seven benedictions recited at a wedding, or at any meal of the bridegroom and bride within a week from the wedding. However, the last blessing (&quot;asher barah&quot;) may be recited in the presence of three men.
* Using the formulation &quot;Let us bless our God, from whose wealth we have eaten,&quot; in preparing for Grace after meals.
* Ancient funeral ceremonies, no longer in use, which incorporated arranging the standing and sitting, reciting the benedictions of the mourners and the consolation of the mourners.

Other instances which require the presence of a &quot;minyan&quot; include:

* Recitation of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy
* Recitation of Birkat ha-Gomel.

While the required quorum for most activities requiring a quorum is usually ten, it is not always so. For example, the Passover sacrifice or Korban &quot;Pesach&quot; (from the days of the Temple in Jerusalem) must be offered before a quorum of 30. (It must be performed in front of &quot;kahal adat yisrael&quot;, the assembly of the congregation of Israel. Ten are needed for the assembly, ten for the congregation, and ten for Israel.) According to some Talmudic authorities, women counted in the quorum of 30 for offering the &quot;Korban Pesach&quot; (e.g. Rav, Rav Kahana, &quot;Pesachim&quot; 79b).

==Prayer with a &quot;minyan&quot;==
It was the firm belief of the sages that wherever ten Israelites are assembled, either for worship or for the study of the Law, the Divine Presence dwells among them. In rabbinical literature, those who meet for study or prayer in smaller groups, even one who meditates or prays alone, are to be praised. However, the stress is put upon the merits and sacredness of the &quot;minyan&quot; of ten. The codifiers, such as Maimonides, his annotators, and the author of the Shulkhan Arukh, have unitedly given strength to this sentiment, and have thus, for more than a thousand years, made the daily attendance at public worship, morning and evening, to be conducted with a quorum of ten.

There is a disagreement between the medieval commentators on whether prayer with a &quot;minyan&quot; is preferable or obligatory. Rashi is of the view that an individual is obligated to pray with a &quot;minyan&quot;, while Nahmanides holds that only if ten adult males are present are they obliged to recite their prayer together, but an individual is not required to seek out a &quot;minyan&quot;.

Rashi and the Tosafot are both of the opinion that one is required to travel the distance of 4 &quot;mil&quot; to pray with a minyan (contemporary authorities differ as to whether this is a distance or a time that it would have taken to travel this distance and with modern technology one would need to travel a lot further). The Mishnah Berurah writes that one who is sitting at home must travel up to one &quot;mil&quot;.

==Eligibility==
There is much discussion in rabbinic literature on the matter of who is eligible to be counted in a &quot;minyan&quot;. Some discussions revolve around whether or not a &quot;minyan&quot; should consist of individuals who are obligated in performance of that particular precept. Some authorities deduce who may constitute a &quot;minyan&quot; by drawing on the verses which are brought as the basis for minyan and their implication. For example, the verse, &quot;How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me?&quot; is referring to the ten spies, a congregation comprising Jewish adult males. It is understood from this that a minyan must likewise comprise ten Jewish adult males. Other classical sources base their rulings on discussions brought in the Talmud. Contemporary rabbinical authorities deal with a plethora of questions relating to qualification for &quot;minyan&quot;.

===Minors===
Before a boy turns thirteen, he is considered a minor in Jewish law and is not obligated in the performance of religious precepts. However, if a child is over six years of age and has adequate comprehension of the significance of the precepts, his status may change. His inclusion in &quot;minyan&quot; is thus subject of Talmudic dispute. Based on the Talmudic passage in Berachot, Rabbeinu Tam states that a minor can act as the tenth person and according to the Baal Ha-Maor, up to four minors would be permitted. Rosh explains that those who permit the inclusion of a minor maintain that it is the Divine Presence which actually constitutes the tenth member, thereby validating the &quot;minyan&quot; — this may explain why some of these authorities require that the minor represent this fact by holding a chumash. However the majority of poskim follow the conclusion of the Ri who holds that a minor can never be counted in a &quot;minyan&quot; under any circumstances. This is the stance taken by the Shulchan Aruch, who, although acknowledging some authorities do permit the inclusion of an astute six-year-old, writes that consensus rejects this view and only males over the age of thirteen may constitute a &quot;minyan&quot;. However, in extraordinary circumstances some are lenient and permit a minor over six years old holding a chumash or Sefer Torah to complete a &quot;minyan&quot;. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein says that we can rely on this because most of the laws of Minyan are Rabbinical in nature (except for the laws of Kiddush Hashem), so one can conclude that when dealing with a Biblical law of Minyan (such as Sanctifying God&#x27;s name in public) one would not be able to count a child.

===Women===
Although the issue of whether women are permitted to make up a &quot;minyan&quot; has been noted in early works, the matter has only come to the fore in the past few decades, a reaction to an enhanced role of women in modern society and to the demand for their inclusion in all areas of religious life.

The Talmud itself does not directly address the question of whether women may count as part of a minyan for devarim shebkdusha. Since the Talmud uses the same &quot;gezerah shavah&quot; for Kiddush Hashem as it uses for &quot;devarim shebkdusha&quot;, one may expect the laws for those two cases to be the same. Many authorities are of the opinion that women are included in the &quot;minyan&quot; for Kiddush Hashem and Hillul Hashem. However, traditional codifiers generally do not include women in the &quot;minyan&quot; for &quot;devarim shebkdusha&quot;.

The Talmud (Arakhin 3a) relates that women are required to recite &quot;zimmun&quot; of three participants, and Berakhot 45 says that women may recite the zimmun. However, the majority of scholars are of the opinion that ten women may not recite the additional form of &quot;zimun be-Shem&quot;, which is obligatory when ten men are present. The few authorities who do permit ten women to use the &quot;zimmun be-Shem&quot; formulation explain that the necessity for ten in this case is unique and cannot be compared to other instances requiring &quot;minyan&quot;. Only Rabbeinu Simcha among these authorities mentions the possibility of one woman&#x27;s joining with nine men to form a &quot;minyan&quot; for prayer. This isolated opinion is rejected by the codifiers. There are a number of cases, including reading of the megillah, where a limited number of authorities count women towards the minyan. However, in these cases the reason why women are counted is not because they constitute a &quot;congregation,&quot; but rather because a public audience is required.

A possible reason why it is men who were obligated to form a congregation in order to convene the Divine Presence is that women were individually considered sufficiently holy and did not require the combination of a group and special prayers to achieve added holiness deficient in men. Due to the righteousness of the women in the wilderness, they did not suffer the same deadly fate as their male counterparts, and despite the spies’ negative report about the holy land, wished to enter it.
Others point to the sociological reality that women were traditionally expected to care for the house and children. The Jewish tradition did not require women to leave their social role to engage in public prayer.

====Reform====
In 1845, rabbis attending the Frankfort Synod of the emerging Reform Judaism declared that women count in a minyan, a formalization of a customary Reform practice dating back to 1811.

====Conservative====
In 1973, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism voted to count men and women equally as members of a minyan. In 2002, the Committee adapted a responsum by Rabbi David Fine which provides an official religious-law foundation for women counting in a &quot;minyan&quot; and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer. This responsum holds that, although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have, as a collective whole, voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others. The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning. By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the &quot;halakhic&quot; tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners.

===Transgressors===
The question of whether a sinner can be counted for a &quot;minyan&quot; has become much more pertinent in recent generations, where a general malaise in religious observance among the majority of Jews has occurred. The Shulchan Aruch states that though a person may be a notorious and habitual sinner and has even committed a capital offense unless a person has been placed under a religious ban due to his sinful behavior, he is counted among the ten. The source provided for this sentiment is from the incident with Achan who, despite having been put to death for his transgression, was still referred to as a Jew. However, the Pri Megadim explains that this is only true if he sins for self-satisfaction, but if a person sins to spite God or has openly severed their connection with the Jewish people by professing a hostile creed or by publicly desecrating the Shabbat, such a person is prohibited from constituting a minyan. Nevertheless, many contemporary authorities have been driven to adopt a lenient view in the face of widespread public non-observance of the Shabbat, on the presumption that it does not indicate a deliberate denial of faith, but is rather a result of ignorance and succumbing to the pressure of social and economic conditions.

===Proselytes===

Even though Tosafot deduce from the Talmud in Sukkah 38b that wherever the verse states “children of Israel” it comes to exclude a proselyte unless there is specific clause for inclusion, here with regard to &quot;minyan&quot; the sources state that there is no reasoning to exclude a full-fledged proselyte. Since such a person is permitted to act as a prayer leader, obviously they can count towards a &quot;minyan&quot;.

===Those who are unable to respond===
As long as a person is of sufficient intelligence, he can be included in the &quot;minyan&quot;, even if he is unable to respond to the prayers which make the presence of ten a necessity. According to some sources, this is because as long as ten are gathered the Divine Presence descends and it is feasible to pronounce a &quot;Dvar she&#x27;bekedusha&quot;. This includes someone who is in the middle of his prayers but is precluded from responding to the hazzan’s incantations and someone who is mute but can hear the prayers — someone who is deaf but has the ability and knows when to respond can also be included. There is however a dispute regarding someone who is asleep or intoxicated. Such a person has sufficient intelligence, but at present can neither hear or respond. Ideally he should be woken to the extent that he is dozing, but in extraneous circumstances where it impossible to arouse him, it is permitted to include the maximum of one sleeping person in the &quot;minyan&quot;. In the case of a drunkard, the accepted view is that even if he has not reached the “drunkenness of Lot”, he still cannot be included. A minimum of six of those gathered in the minyan have a duty to listen attentively and respond appropriately to the additional prayers and that at least nine are required to respond for the repetition of the &quot;Amidah&quot;.

==Arrangement==
It is not just the status of the individual which dictates eligibility; the physical arrangement of the &quot;minyan&quot; is also a factor. Maimonides delineates the confines which are placed on the arrangement of the people making up a &quot;minyan&quot;. Ideally all the members of the minyan should be gathered in one room. However, if they are within hearing distance of one another, it is permitted for the ten to be distributed in two adjoining rooms. Later authorities limit the extent of this opinion and rule that even if there is an opening between the two rooms, the two groups are still considered separate entities. Only in unusual circumstances is it permitted, as long as some of the men in each room can see each other.

==Ten-and-ten minyan (ten men and ten women)==
Over the last decade or so, some very liberal Modern Orthodox communities have formed an attempt to combine commitment to traditional Jewish law with a push for increased participation and recognition of the role of women. While many are simply referred to as independent minyanim, the term used by the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance for those groups that consider themselves part of the Modern Orthodox community is partnership minyan. Many of these groups have adopted the custom initially instituted by Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem to wait for a &quot;ten-and-ten minyan&quot;, made up of ten men and ten women.

Shira Hadasha has based many of its decisions on the writings of rabbis like Mendel Shapiro and Daniel Sperber. Some also use the Guide for the Halakhic Minyan, a compendium of halakhic sources supporting increased participation by women in services, as a basis for discussions of practices like the ten-and-ten minyan.

<text>The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: &quot;Corpus Hippocraticum&quot;), or Hippocratic Collection, is a collection of around 60 early Ancient Greek medical works strongly associated with the physician Hippocrates and his teachings. The Hippocratic Corpus covers many diverse aspects of medicine, from Hippocrates&#x27; medical theories to what he devised to be ethical means of medical practice, to addressing various illnesses. Even though it is considered a singular corpus that represents Hippocratic medicine, they vary (sometimes significantly) in content, age, style, methods, and views practiced; therefore, authorship is largely unknown. The ancient commentaries on this corpus, from writers such as Attalion and Oribasius, are myriad. Hippocrates began Western society&#x27;s development of medicine, through a delicate blending of the art of healing and scientific observations. What Hippocrates was sharing from within his collection of works was not only how to identify symptoms of disease and proper diagnostic practices, but more essentially, he was alluding to his personable form of art, &quot;The art of true living and the art of fine medicine combined.&quot; The Hippocratic Corpus became the foundation upon which Western medical practice was built.

== Hippocrates&#x27; contribution to medicine ==
Hippocrates was born on the Greek island of Kos. The verifiable details of his life are few, despite centuries of hagiographic accounts. According to tradition, Hippocrates was born into a hereditary order of priest-like physicians known as Asclepiads. At the time, the practice of medicine involved spiritual and supernatural elements, corresponding to the prevailing belief that health and illness were conferred by the gods. Hippocrates did not share this view. For example, according to works later ascribed to him, he was the first to describe epilepsy as an inheritable brain disease rather than an infliction from the divine. In addition to his rejection of purely divine causes of illness, Hippocrates rejected the idea that medicine could only be practiced by those born into the priestly Asclepiad class like himself. He went on to establish a medical school at Kos and opened it to those born outside of the Asclepiad class. Known as the father of medicine, Hippocrates was an admirable physician and teacher during his time. When considered among fellow ancient Greek philosophers and physicians, Hippocrates was considered the most influential in the evolution of medicine as a science. He focused on a natural approach to medicine, expressing that there had to be a comprehensive understanding of the patient&#x27;s health, as well as harmony between nature and the individual.

Hippocrates&#x27; focal point for medicine stemmed from the practice of scientific discipline. To enforce scientific discipline, Hippocrates based his medical principles on natural sciences, diagnosing, treating, and preventing medical diseases. In addition to a focus on natural approaches, he also began to look into anatomical and physiological relationships in the body. He also heavily believed in the study of anatomy and the nervous system. By understanding the anatomy of the human body, Hippocrates was able to recognize symptoms holistically when diagnosing a patient. To align completely with his emphasis on the physical observation of the human body, Hippocrates eliminated any religious element from his account of medicine. In the Hippocratic text &quot;On Flesh, On Regimen, On Diseases I, On Winds,&quot; relevant works from the Hippocratic Corpus, he firmly established the limited focus he planned to employ with his medical concerns, that is, he had determined that he would only entertain natural phenomena that are relevant to the medical issue at hand.

Another contribution Hippocrates had to medicine was evidence-based knowledge. Hippocrates was the first to ever establish the belief that by simply observing a patient, a physician would recognize symptoms and determine the disease. Hippocrates insisted that he must keep careful notes and follow the patient from the start of the disease to the end no matter what that might have looked like so he could compile different symptoms and treatments. The ideal of evidence-based knowledge is still implemented in the medical field and has set the standards for physicians today. According to Hippocrates, medicine was dependent on detailed observation of symptoms and health, prognosis, treatment of the patient, and reason to establish diagnosis.

While the Hippocratic Corpus was not written by Hippocrates himself, the compiled work of medical professionals all follow the same guidelines imposed by Hippocratic medicine. Hippocrates laid the foundation for modern medicine, as his protocols and guidelines for the classification of diseases are being utilized by physicians today. His principles for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases have been preserved in the Hippocratic Corpus, and are the standard for medical ethics today.

==Authorship, name, origin==

Of the texts in the corpus, none is proven to be by Hippocrates himself, The works of the corpus range from Hippocrates&#x27; time and school to many centuries later and rival points of view. Franz Zacharias Ermerins identifies the hands of at least nineteen authors in the Hippocratic Corpus. However, the varied works of the corpus have gone under Hippocrates&#x27; name since antiquity. According to Howard Clark Kee, its a haphazard collection of anonymous authors.

The corpus may be the remains of a library of Cos, or a collection compiled in the third century BC in Alexandria. However, the corpus includes works beyond those of the Coan school of ancient Greek medicine; works from the Cnidian school are included as well.

Only a fraction of the Hippocratic writings have survived. The lost medical literature is sometimes referred to in the surviving treatises, as at the beginning of &quot;Regimen&quot;. Some Hippocratic works are known only in translation from their original Greek to other languages; given that the quality and accuracy of a translation without a surviving original cannot be known, it is difficult to identify the author with certainty. &quot;Hippocratic&quot; texts survive in Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, and Latin.

==Dates and groupings==
The majority of the works in the Hippocratic Corpus date from the Classical period, the last decades of the 5th century BC and the first half of the 4th century BC. Among the later works, &quot;The Law&quot;, &quot;On the Heart&quot;, &quot;On the Physician&quot;, and &quot;On Sevens&quot; are all Hellenistic, while &quot;Precepts&quot; and &quot;On Decorum&quot; are from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD.

Some of the earliest works of the corpus (mid-fifth century) are connected to the Cnidian school: &quot;On Diseases&quot; II–III and the early layer within &quot;On the Diseases of Women&quot; I–II and &quot;On Sterile Women&quot;. &quot;Prorrhetics&quot; I is also mid-fifth century. In the second half of the fifth century, a single author likely produced the treatises &quot;On Airs, Waters, Places&quot;; &quot;Prognostics&quot;; &quot;Prorrhetics&quot; II; and &quot;On the Sacred Disease&quot;. Other fifth-century works include &quot;On Fleshes&quot;, &quot;Epidemics&quot; I and III (), &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot;, &quot;On Regimen in Acute Diseases&quot;, and Polybus&#x27; &quot;On the Nature of Man&quot;/&quot;Regimen in Health&quot; (410–400 BC).

At the end of the fifth or the beginning of the fourth century, one author likely wrote &quot;Epidemics&quot; II–IV–VI and &quot;On the Humors&quot;. The coherent group of surgical treatises (&quot;On Fractures&quot;, &quot;On Joints&quot;, &quot;On Injuries of the Head&quot;, &quot;Surgery&quot;, &quot;Mochlicon&quot;) is of similar date.

The gynecological treatises &quot;On the Nature of the Woman&quot;, &quot;On the Diseases of Women&quot;, &quot;Generation&quot;, &quot;On the Nature of the Child&quot;, and &quot;On Sterile Women&quot; constitute a closely related group. identified five layers of material in this group, from the mid-fifth century to the mid-fourth century. The oldest stratum is found in &quot;On the Nature of the Woman&quot; and &quot;On the Diseases of Women&quot; II. &quot;Generation&quot; and &quot;On the Nature of the Child&quot; constitute a single work by a late-fifth-century author, who may also be identified as the author of &quot;On Diseases&quot; IV and of sections of &quot;On the Diseases of Women&quot; I. The latest layer is &quot;On Sterile Women&quot;, which was composed after the other gynecological treatises were in existence.

A single fourth-century author probably wrote &quot;On Fistulae&quot; and &quot;On Hemorrhoids&quot;.

Author Susan Wise Bauer writes that, because it explains disease &quot;without blaming or invoking the gods&quot;, the Corpus is &quot;the first surviving book of science&quot;.

==Content==
The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks, lectures, research, notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine, in no particular order. These works were written for different audiences, both specialists and laymen, and were sometimes written from opposing view points; significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus.

===Case histories===
One significant portion of the corpus is made up of case histories. Books I and III of &quot;Epidemics&quot; contain forty-two case histories, of which 60% (25) ended in the patient&#x27;s death. Nearly all of the diseases described in the Corpus are endemic diseases: colds, consumption, pneumonia, etc.

===Theoretical and methodological reflections===
In several texts of the corpus, the ancient physicians develop theories of illness, sometimes grappling with the methodological difficulties that lie in the way of effective and consistent diagnosis and treatment. As scholar Jacques Jouanna writes, &quot;One of the great merits of the physicians of the Hippocratic Corpus is that they are not content to practice medicine and to commit their experience to writing, but that they have reflected on their own activity&quot;.

====Reason and experience====
While the approaches range from empiricism to a rationalism reminiscent of the physical theories of the pre-Socratic philosophers, these two tendencies can exist side-by-side: &quot;The close association between knowledge and experience is characteristic of the Hippocratics,&quot; despite &quot;the Platonic attempt to drive a wedge between the two&quot;.

The author of &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot; launches immediately into a critique of opponents who posit a single &quot;cause in all cases&quot; of disease, &quot;having laid down as a hypothesis for their account hot or cold or wet or dry or anything else they want&quot;. The method put forward in this treatise &quot;could certainly be characterized as an empirical one&quot;, preferring the effects of diet as observed by the senses to cosmological speculations, and it was seized upon by Hellenistic Empiricist doctors for this reason. However, &quot;unlike the Empiricists, the author does not claim that the doctor&#x27;s knowledge is &quot;limited&quot; to what can be observed by the senses. On the contrary, he requires the doctor to have quite extensive knowledge of aspects of the human constitution that cannot be observed directly, such as the state of the patient&#x27;s humors and internal organs&quot;.

====Epistemology and the scientific status of medicine====
The author of &quot;The Art&quot; is at pains to defend the status of medicine as an art (&quot;techne&quot;), against opponents who (perhaps following Protagoras&#x27; critique of expert knowledge) claim it produces no better results against disease than chance (an attack served by the fact that doctors refused to treat the serious and difficult cases they judged to be incurable by their art). The treatise may be considered &quot;the first attempt at general epistemology bequeathed to us by antiquity&quot;, although this may only be because we have lost fifth-century rhetorical works that took a similar approach.

For this writer, as for the author of &quot;On the Places in Man&quot;, the art of medicine has been wholly discovered. While for the author of &quot;On the Places in Man&quot; &quot;the principles discovered in it clearly have very little need of good luck&quot;, the author of &quot;The Art&quot; acknowledges the practical limitations that arise in the therapeutic application of these principles. Likewise for the author of &quot;On Regimen&quot;, the &quot;knowledge and discernment of the nature of man in general—knowledge of its primary constituents and discernment of the components by which it is controlled&quot; may be completely worked out, and yet in practice it is difficult to determine and apply the correct and proportionate diet and exercise to the individual patient.

==== Humours ====
The Hippocratic Corpus explains diseases using the Four Humours in which are described a Phlegm, Yellow Bile, Blood and Black Bile. These medical writings associated each of the humours with a specific organ which goes as follows; blood with the heart, yellow bile with the liver, black bile with the spleen and phlegm with the brain. With each humour, there were specific properties that applied to changes in the fluids such as blood is hot and moist, phlegm is cold and moist, yellow bile is hot and dry and black bile is cold and dry. The authors of the Hippocratic Corpus described that these four humors play a very important role in our health as when there is a little or too much of one of the humours, a disease might occur.

==== Mental Illness ====
The most controversial elements of health and disease during the BC time was the issue of mental illnesses as it was always related to a higher power punishment or demonic nature. The Hippocratic Corpus employed many new vocabulary words to describe mental ailments that coincided with intensity, duration or severity and used these terms to scale from mildest to the strongest form.

====Natural vs. divine causality====
Whatever their disagreements, the Hippocratic writers agree in rejecting divine and religious causes and remedies of disease in favor of natural mechanisms. Hippocratic medicine had been formulated to hold true to the belief that &quot;medicine should be practiced as a scientific discipline based on the natural sciences, diagnosing and preventing disease as well as treating them.&quot; This not only influenced the relevance of heaven in medicine, and the church&#x27;s influence on the practice of medicine, but also the relevance of astronomy and cosmology in medicine as a science. Greek tragedy encouraged the spread of false knowledge about the divine origin of human diseases. Greek gods were placed on a pedestal, and seen as healers as a result. To combat this view of diseases, Hippocratic physicians restricted their diagnoses to rational causes and rejected anthropomorphic intervention as the cause and solution of medical issues. In addition to Greek poetry and tragedy, magicians, charlatans, and purifiers can also be considered responsible for the widespread of &#x27;sacred&#x27; explanations. Doing this allowed them to step in and provide inefficacious remedies that could convince the gods to intervene and fix these sacred issues experienced by individuals. Thus &quot;On the Sacred Disease&quot; considers that epilepsy (the so-called &quot;sacred&quot; disease) &quot;has a natural cause, and its supposed divine origin is due to men&#x27;s inexperience and to their wonder at its peculiar character.&quot; An exception to this rule is found in &quot;Dreams&quot; (&quot;Regime&quot; IV), in which prayers to the gods are prescribed alongside more typically Hippocratic interventions. Though materialistic determinism goes back in Greek thought at least to Leucippus, &quot;One of the greatest virtues of the physicians of the Hippocratic Collection is to have stated, in its most universal form, what was later to be called the principle of determinism. All that occurs has a cause. It is in the treatise of &quot;The Art&quot; that the most theoretical statement of this principle is to be found: &#x27;Indeed, under a close examination spontaneity disappears; for everything that occurs will be found to do so through something [&quot;dia ti&quot;].&#x27;&quot; In a famous passage of &quot;On Ancient Medicine&quot;, the author insists on the importance of knowledge of causal explanations: &quot;It is not sufficient to learn simply that cheese is a bad food, as it gives a pain to one who eats a surfeit of it; we must know what the pain is, the reasons for it [&quot;dia ti&quot;], and which constituent of man is harmfully affected.&quot;

=== Natural approach to health and wellness ===
The writers of the treatises in the Hippocratic Corpus emphasized a natural approach to health and wellness. During the Asclepius paradigm, Hippocrates used a natural way to treat disease. These natural approaches emphasized the importance of the harmony between the human body and the environment in which we live in. Writings in the Hippocratic Corpus also emphasized the importance of realizing how the environment might cause diseases. Treating diseases with a natural approach is also a topic that can be found in the Hippocratic Corpus. Hippocratic tradition also found that it is important to understand the causes of physiological factors and how these physiological factors hold a therapeutic significance. To add to the natural approach of health and wellness, Hippocratic tradition also emphasized that the mind, body, and spirit were all independent of one another.

=== Health Promotion and the Olympic Games ===
Health promotion was another topic found in the treatises of the Hippocratic Corpus. To promote the well-being of students and their physical and mental health in schools, physical activity was conducted as a necessary activity that allowed the student&#x27;s physical health to be the best it could be. An example of health promotion being used can be found during the Olympic games. One example of health promotion being used during the Olympic games was olive oil being used to warm up athletes&#x27; body temperatures so that they could perform to the best of their abilities. Ancient greeks believed that it was essential to have a harmony between the body and the mind. This led to the idea of a &quot;Healthy mind in a Healthy Body&quot; which is a common phrase that people might hear.

Food was another topic of health promotion in the Hippocratic Corpus. These writings discussed that in order for food to be beneficial to the health of one, the source should be adapted to human nature and food is defined as more forceful or less forceful properties. It was explained in the Hippocratic Corpus that to avoid a diet that was too forceful we must implement cooking and mixing as this was already a type of medicine that can help ease the cause of suffering, illness and death. It has been discovered that during the Olympic games, figs and other fruits were given to the athletes so that the high concentration of glucose in the food would give them the energy they needed to compete to the best of their ability.

===Medical ethics and manners===
The duties of the physician are an object of the Hippocratic writers&#x27; attention. The series of texts composing the Corpus educates readers on the practices of identifying symptoms in patients, diagnosis, prognosis, treatments, ethics, and bedside manner. In Ancient Greece, being a man of high morals went hand in hand with being a morally just physician. A famous maxim (&quot;Epidemics&quot; I.11) advises: &quot;As to diseases, make a habit of two things—to help, or at least to do no harm.&quot;

The most famous work in the Hippocratic Corpus is the Hippocratic Oath, a landmark declaration of medical ethics. The Hippocratic Oath is both philosophical and practical; it not only deals with abstract principles but practical matters such as removing stones and aiding one&#x27;s teacher financially. It is a complex and probably not the work of one man. It remains in use, though rarely in its original form.

The preamble of &quot;On the Physician&quot; offers &quot;a physical and moral portrait of the ideal physician&quot;, and the &quot;Precepts&quot; also concern the physician&#x27;s conduct. Treatises such as &quot;On Joints&quot; and &quot;Epidemics&quot; VI are concerned with the provision of such &quot;courtesies&quot; as providing a patient with cushions during a procedure, and &quot;Decorum&quot; includes advice on good manners to be observed in the doctor&#x27;s office or when visiting patients.

=== Urology ===
With many books incorporating different urology practices and observations and nearly 30 works in the Hippocratic book collection entitled &quot;Aphorism&quot; seemingly solely dedicated to urology in general, urology was one subject that was thoroughly investigated. Seemingly, the main and most problematic topic covered in urology was that of bladder disease in patients, especially when urinary tract stones (that is, stones within either the kidneys or the bladder) were present. Urinary tract stones, in general, have been seen within records all throughout history, even as far back as the ancient days of Egypt. Theorizing how these urinary tract stones formed, how to detect them and other bladder issues, and the controversy on how to treat them were all major investigating points to the authors of the Hippocratic Corpus.

==== Stone formation theories ====
Throughout the books of the Hippocratic Corpus, there are varying hypotheses as to reasons why and exactly how urinary tract stones actually formed. It is noted that these hypotheses were all based on the use of uroscopy and observation of patients by doctors of the time.
*Within the work &quot;On the Nature of Man&quot;, suggest that the bladder stones first form within or attached to the aorta, much like any other tumor-like object would. In this place, the stone will essentially form pus. Afterward, this stone formation is transported by the blood vessels and forced into the bladder where urine will also be transported.
*In another work, &quot;On Airs, Waters, Places&quot;, it is suggested that drinking water can attribute to urinary tract stones. If water consumed consists of a mixture of more than one water sources, the water is of impure quality. The different waters are in conflict with one another and therefore produce deposits of sediment. The accumulation of these deposits within the urinary tract due to drinking the waters can then result in urinary tract stones.
*Additionally in &quot;On Airs, Waters, Places&quot;, another passage describes that formation of urinary tract stones will occur when urine cannot flow through the system easily and causes the sediment in the urine to collect in one area and meld, forming a stone. This can occur when inflammation occurs within the part of the bladder leading to the urethra. When the stone forms at this point, it can block flow and, therefore, cause pain. In this scenario, it was hypothesized that males are more likely to form stones than females due to the anatomy of the bladder.

==== Detecting bladder disease/stones ====
The main mechanism of detecting bladder disease&#x27;s symptoms, including inflammation and urinary tract stone formations, is through the appearance of the urine itself and the changes that occur with the urine over time. In &quot;Aphorism&quot;, it was simply stated that as the appearance of urine diverges more and more from the appearance of &quot;healthy&quot; urine, the more likely it is to be diseased and the worse the disease becomes.

In &quot;Aphorism&quot; works, it was noted that urine lacking color could indicate diseases of the brain – some today think that this author who made this statement was meaning to refer to chronic renal failure or even diabetes. It was also suggested that the appearance of blood within urine could indicate vessels of the kidney to have burst, potentially due to necrosis of blood arteries or vessels. Furthermore, doctors noted that if bubbles formed on top of urine, the kidneys were diseased and showed the potential of long-lasting disease.

==== Treatment of bladder disease/stones ====
When it comes to the treatment of urinary tract stones, many solutions were suggested, including drinking a lot of a water/wine mixture, taking strong medication, or trying different positions when trying to flush them out.

Extracting the urinary tract stones was another option; however, this method was not utilized very often due to its serious risks and possible complications of cutting into the bladder. Other than leakage of urine into the body cavity, another common complication was that of the cells of the testes dying due to the spermatic cord inadvertently being cut during the procedure.

In fact, due to these and other complications and the lack of antiseptics and pain medicines, the Hippocratic Oath opted for the avoidance of surgery – unless absolutely necessary – especially when concerning surgeries that dealt with the urinary tract and more so when stone removal was the intent. Although, the urinary tract stone removal was not a necessary surgery and it appeared to be avoided in most cases, some argue that the Hippocratic Oath only wards of these procedures if the doctor holding the knife is inexperienced in that area. This idea puts forth the development of medical specialties – that is, doctors focusing on one particular area of medicine versus studying the wide array of material that is medicine. The doctors whom have become experts in the urinary tract – whom we would call urologists today – are those that could perform the heightened risk procedure of stone removal. With this reliance on specialized doctors of the urinary tract, some believe that urology itself was the first definable expertise of medical history.
=== Wine ===
References to wine can be found throughout Greek antiquity in both dramas and medical texts. The Hippocratic texts describe wine as a powerful substance, that when consumed in excess can cause physical disorders, today known as intoxication. Although the negative effects of wine on the human body are documented within the Hippocratic Corpus, the author or authors maintain an objective attitude towards wine. During this time, those studying medicine were interested in the physical effects of wine, therefore no medical text condemned the use of wine in excess. According to the Hippocratic text, the consumption of wine significantly affects two regions of the body: the head and the lower body cavity. Excessive drinking can cause heaviness of the head and pain in the head, in addition to disturbances in thought. In the lower body cavity, excess wine ingestion can have a purging effect; it can be the source of stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. This stomach pain was more common among athletes because of their intense diets composed mainly of meat and wine. An overall effect of wine that all Greek doctors of the time observed and agreed on was its warming property. Therefore, wine&#x27;s properties are described as &quot;hot and dry.&quot; As documented in the Hippocratic texts, extreme use of wine can result in death.

Physicians tried to study the human body with pure objectivity to give the most accurate explanation for the effects of external substances that could be given for the time. During this period, physicians believed not all wines were equally potent in producing a range of perilous symptoms. According to the Hippocratic texts, physicians carefully categorized wine by properties such as color, taste, viscosity, smell, and age. According to Hippocrates, a more concentrated wine leads to a heavy head and difficulty thinking, and a soft wine inflames the spleen and liver and produces wind in the intestine. Other observations of the ingestion of wine included the varying levels of tolerance within the population being observed. This observation led to the belief that the size of one&#x27;s body and one&#x27;s environment had an influence on ability to handle wine. Because of this, different people would require different concentrations and dilutions of wine for medicinal use. After observation, men with larger bodies were able to consume more than men with smaller bodies and the same effects could be observed between them. Physician&#x27;s also hypothesized that gender contributed to the effects of wine on the body. Women were noted to have a cold and wet nature which encouraged Hippocratic doctors to prescribe them undiluted wine. This differed from men, who typically were hotter by nature. It was not common practice between physicians of the time to recommend the consumption of wine for children. Physicians collectively believed that there was no purpose for children to drink wine. However, in rare circumstances, there are records of some doctors recommending wine for children, only if heavily diluted with water, to warm the child or to ease hunger pangs. Mostly, doctors prohibited wine consumption for people under eighteen.

Greek physicians were very interested in observing and recording the effects of wine and intoxication, the excessive use of wine was well known to be harmful, however, it was also documented as a useful remedy. Several of the Hippocratic texts list the properties and use of foods consumed during 5th century BC. Wine was first defined as a food by all doctors. Directions for consumption varied based on gender, season, and other events in daily life. Men were encouraged to consume dark, undiluted wine before copulation, not to the point of intoxication, however enough to provide power and guarantee strength to the fetus. Because of wine&#x27;s visual similarity to blood, physicians had assumed a relationship between the two substances. For this reason, men with cardiac illness, lack of strength, or pale complexion were encouraged to consume dark, undiluted wine. Multiple texts within the Hippocratic Corpus advise the use of wine in accordance with the seasons. During the winter, wine must be undiluted, to counter the cold and wet, because wine&#x27;s properties are dry and hot. During fall and spring, wine should be moderately diluted, and during the summer, wine should be diluted as much as possible with water, because of the hot temperatures. The practice of mixing wine and diluting wine is also seen in prescription form, however, the dosage and quantities are left to the doctor. The prescription of wine as a treatment was prohibited with diseases that affected the head, brain, and those accompanied by a fever. Wine could also be used as an external remedy by mixing it with other substances such as honey, milk, water, or oil to make salves or soaks. Patients with pneumonia like illnesses would soak in a wine mixture and breath in the vapors with the intent to expel the pus from their lungs. Wine was frequently prescribed as a topical remedy for sores because of its drying effect.

=== Epidemics 1 ===

&quot;Epidemics 1&quot; begins by describing each season&#x27;s characteristics. It states that autumn has strong south winds and many rainy days. Winter had south winds with the occasional north wind and droughts. Spring was southerly and cold with slight rain. Summer was cloudy and did not rain.

It then described diseases associated with each season. For example, in spring many people began having mild fevers which, in some cases, caused hemorrhage. The hemorrhage was rarely fatal. Swelling next to both ears was also common. Coughs and sore throats accompanied the other symptoms. Based on modern knowledge, this disease was mumps, which causes salivary glands under the ears to swell. It is remarkable that this ancient work describes symptoms so vividly that modern doctors can diagnose the cause a thousand years later. This section of the Hippocratic Corpus assumes that when looking at human disease and the health of humans, you must look at the seasons, winds and orientation of places, the nature of the water, the nature of the soil and the lifestyle of the inhabitants of a particular city.

&quot;Epidemics 1&quot; goes on to describe the climate on two occasions and the diseases associated with them, called &quot;constitutions&quot;. The symptoms described include more serious, sometimes lethal, fevers, eye infections, and dysentery.

=== On &quot;Diseases&quot; ===
Jaundice is a disease that is mentioned numerous times throughout and is described as occurring in five ways. Jaundice is when the skin or eyes turn yellow. The Greek physicians thought of Jaundice to be a disease itself rather than what medical professionals know now to be a symptom of various other diseases. The Greeks also believed that there were five kinds of jaundice that can occur and report the differences between them.

The first kind can quickly turn fatal. The skin appears to be green. The analogy made in the text is that the skin is greener than a green lizard. The patient will have fevers, shiver, and the skin becomes very sensitive. In the mornings, sharp pains occur in the abdominal region. If the patient survives more than two weeks, they have a chance of recovery. The treatments suggest drinking a mixture of milk and other nuts and plants in the morning and at night. The second form develops only during the summer because it was believed the heat of the sun causes bile, a dark green fluid produced by the liver, to rest underneath the skin. This causes a yellowish color to the skin, and pale eyes and urine. The scalp also develops a crusty substance. The treatment calls for several baths a day on top of the mixture mentioned in the first remedy. Surviving past two weeks with this form of jaundice was rare. In two other forms of this disease, occurring during the winter, set in due to drunkenness, chills, and the excess production of phlegm. The last form is the least fatal and most common. It is associated with eating and drinking too much. The symptoms include yellow eyes and skin, fever, headache, and weakness. The treatment however, it very different from the rest. The physician will draw blood from the elbows, and advise to take hot baths, drink cucumber juice, and induce vomiting to clear the bowels. If the treatment is followed, a full recovery is possible. The several forms of jaundice that the Greek physicians proclaimed might be because jaundice occurs due to varying sicknesses like hepatitis, gallstones and tumors. The diverse set of symptoms were probably the effects of the sicknesses rather than the jaundice itself.

=== Empyemas ===
An empyema is a Greek word derived from the word which means &quot;pus-producing&quot;. According to the Hippocratic Corpus, they can occur in the thorax, the uterus, the bladder, the ear, and other parts of the body. However, the writings indicate that the thorax was the most common and provided more description. Physicians at the time thought that the cause of an empyema was by orally ingesting some form of foreign body where it will enter the lungs. This could be done by inhaling or drinking the foreign body. The physicians also thought that empyemas could occur after parapneumonic infections or pleurisy because the chest has not recovered from those illnesses. Parapneumonic infections can be tied to modern pneumonia which can still be fatal.

There are many symptoms associated with an empyema ranging from mild to severe. The most common ones are fever, thoracic pain, sweating, heaviness in the chest, and a cough. Treating an empyema was primarily done using herbal remedies or non-invasive treatments. Mostly mixtures of plants and organic matter were drunk or bathed in. There are a few extreme cases in which invasive procedures were performed and mentioned in detail. One of these treatments included the patient behind held down in a chair while the physician cut between the ribs with a scalpel and inserted a drainage tube which would remove all of the pus. The research and descriptions that the Greek physicians performed were so accurate that they were the foundation of what we know about empyemas today.

=== Dermatology ===
The Hippocratic Corpus provides valuable guidance for dermatology and the diagnosis of skin diseases or infections. Hippocrates described multiple dermatologic diseases, specifically in neonatal and pediatrics. These diseases included intertrigo, lichenoid eruptions, vitiligo, furuncle, leprosy, papulosquamous disease, skin reactions to specific medications, skin reactions to mosquito bites, warts, scabies, and impetigo. Along with the variety of skin diseases described in the Hippocratic Corpus is the suggest treatment. These treatments stem from the belief that dermatologic diseases were a result of imbalance in body humors.

For relief from various dermatologic conditions, the Hippocratic text recommends spring water or seawater baths and topical application of a fatty substance as a form of treatment. For intertrigo, or infant chafing, myrrh oil and litharge were powerful astringent compounds that were recommended as a form of treatment. For lichenoid skin conditions, vinegar, steam baths, pumice stones, and manna (sugar substance derived from mica thuris plant) were recommended to treat this skin disease. The Hippocratic text also offers sulfur as a treatment for lichenoid, which has a strong antibacterial effect that is still prescribed in dermatologic medications today. For leprosy and vitiligo, lime water and concentrated vinegar are recommended by the Hippocratic Corpus to treat these conditions.

Many of these forms of treatment proposed in the Hippocratic Corpus are utilized today for dermatologic infections. Modern medicine makes use of sulfur as an antibacterial compound, spring water has shown effective benefits when treating skin diseases, and oil-based products such as myrrh oil and litharge are used as ointments to treat intertrigo, eczemas, and skin lesions. When reflecting on the treatments of skin diseases and infections in the Hippocratic Corpus, it is evident that some of the approaches when applied to modern dermatology are still valid.

=== Conception ===
The Hippocratic Corpus contains many contributions from across the medical field including notes on conception. Some of these contributions were put into two sections of the corpus called &quot;Diseases of Women I&quot; and &quot;Diseases of Women II.&quot; The sections go into detail on concepts such as abortion, obstetrical notes, and early forms of gynecology.

==== Lack of fertility ====
The &quot;Diseases of Women&quot; details that an infertile woman with a low menstruation rate may have a bent cervix that essentially blocks the pathway. It offers a few treatments in the way of treating a bent cervix depending on how the generating seed is washed down and the length of time it takes for that to happen. Options are offered for treating the uterus, head, and body depending on the observation of the seed.

==== Menses ====
Menses is another way of wording menstruation or blood flow discharge from the uterus. There are multiple sections within the works dedicated to different types of menses along with their understood meanings of the time. There is a large portion dedicated to what a doctor should expect of standard menses along with some slight variations.

Within the &quot;Diseases of Women I,&quot; the average amount of menses for healthy women should be somewhere around a half pint for around two-three days.

The flow itself is considered to require the viewers judgment but does go on to say that it should flow like a blood from a sacrificial lamb, indicating the timeframe of the work, and that the blood should coagulate readily. The health of an individual or even their likelihood of pregnancy was remarked upon by evaluating the length of the menstruation. A menstruation period longer than four days was thought to be an indicator of more delicate embryos. Less than three days is said to indicate robust and healthy individuals but would lead to likely infertility.

==== Complications of childbirth ====
The lochia and its presence is noted along with other possible complications after childbirth. Uterus sensitivity, lower back pain, aches across the body, swelling, and chills are all noted to be expected. Fever is the outlier that have different treatments based on the treaty.

Bathing with oils along with lily oil rubbed on the woman&#x27;s head is recommended. Oil should also be applied to her uterus. Vapor baths in general are the main focus for treatment after childbirth.

The change with a fever is to avoid bathing. Vapor treatment with an application using a hot towel is recommended on her lower stomach and back. A diet of boiled meal with rue or barley gruel is recommended seemingly for with or without a fever.

A paragraph is dedicated to the experience in childbirth of the woman in question affecting the post childbirth reactions. Women are noted to not have an understanding of what sickness they may have or the pride of the woman causing her to not discuss their symptoms. The paragraph pleads for doctors themselves to be well-versed in the possible post-birth diseases that women may have and know how to spot it themselves.

==Style==
The writing style of the Corpus has been remarked upon for centuries, being described by some as, &quot;clear, precise, and simple&quot;. It is often praised for its objectivity and conciseness, yet some have criticized it as being &quot;grave and austere&quot;. Francis Adams, a translator of the Corpus, goes further and calls it sometimes &quot;obscure&quot;. Of course, not all of the Corpus is of this &quot;laconic&quot; style, though most of it is. It was Hippocratic practice to write in this style.

The whole corpus is written in Ionic Greek, though the island of Cos was in a region that spoke Doric Greek.

&quot;The Art&quot; and &quot;On Breaths&quot; show the influence of Sophistic rhetoric; they &quot;are characterized by long introductions and conclusions, antitheses, anaphoras, and sound effects typical of Gorgianic style&quot;. Other works also have rhetorical elements. In general, it can be said that &quot;the Hippocratic physician was also an orator&quot;, with his role including public speeches and &quot;verbal wrestling matches&quot;.

==Printed editions==
The entire Hippocratic Corpus was first printed as a unit in 1525. This edition was in Latin and was edited by Marcus Fabius Calvus in Rome. The first complete Greek edition followed the next year from the Aldine Press in Venice. A significant edition was that of Émile Littré who spent twenty-two years (1839–1861) working diligently on a complete Greek edition and French translation of the Hippocratic Corpus. This was scholarly, yet sometimes inaccurate and awkward. Another edition of note was that of Franz Zacharias Ermerins, published in Utrecht between 1859 and 1864. Kühlewein&#x27;s Teubner edition (1894–1902) &quot;mark[ed] a distinct advance&quot;.

Beginning in 1967, an important modern edition by and others began to appear (with Greek text, French translation, and commentary) in the Collection Budé. Other important bilingual annotated editions (with translation in German or French) continue to appear in the &quot;Corpus medicorum graecorum&quot; published by the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

===English translations===
The first English translation from the Hippocratic Corpus, Peter Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Chirurgerie&quot; (&quot;Surgery&quot;), was published in 1597, but a complete English translation of a dozen and a half &quot;genuine&quot; works was not offered in English until Francis Adams&#x27; publication of 1849. Other works of the corpus remained untranslated into English until the resumed publication of the Loeb Classical Library edition beginning in 1988. The first four Loeb volumes were published in 1923–1931, and seven further volumes between 1988 and 2012.

==History and profile==

===Pre-World War II===
 was founded in 1904 by Jean Jaurès, leader of the French Socialist Party (PSF), which merged the following year in the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO). Jaurès also edited the paper until his assassination on 31 July 1914.

When the SFIO split at the 1920 Tours Congress, the Communists took control of , which became the official organisation of the French Communist Party (PCF), despite its socialist origins, while the SFIO retained control of the minor daily &quot;Le Populaire&quot;. The PCF has published it ever since and owns 40% of the paper with the remaining shares held by staff, readers and &quot;friends&quot; of the paper. The paper is also sustained by the annual &quot;Fête de l&#x27;Humanité&quot;, held in the working class suburbs of Paris, at Le Bourget, near Aubervilliers, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the country.

The fortunes of have fluctuated with those of the PCF. During the 1920s, when the PCF was politically isolated, it was kept in existence only by donations from Party members.

Louis Aragon started to write for in 1933, in the &quot;news in brief&quot; section. He later led &quot;Les Lettres françaises&quot;, the paper&#x27;s weekly literary supplement. With the formation of the Popular Front in 1936, ″s circulation and status increased, and many leading French intellectuals wrote for it.
 was banned during World War II but continued publication secretly until the liberation of Paris from German occupation in 1944.

=== After World War II ===
The paper&#x27;s status was highest in the years after World War II, when the PCF was the dominant party of the French left and enjoyed a large circulation. Since the 1980s, however, the PCF has been in decline, mostly due to the rise of the Socialist Party, which took over large sections of PCF support; circulation and economic viability of have declined as well.

Until 1990 the PCF and received regular subsidies from the Soviet Union. According to the French authors Victor Loupan and Pierre Lorrain (fr), received free newsprint from Soviet sources.

=== Post-Soviet Union ===
The fall of the Soviet Union and the continued decline of the PCF&#x27;s electoral base produced a crisis for .
Its circulation, more than 500,000 after the war, slumped to under 70,000. In 2001, after a decade of financial decline, the PCF sold 20% of the paper to a group of private investors led by the TV channel TF1 (part of the Bouygues group) and including Hachette (Lagardère Group). TF1 said its motive was &quot;maintenance of media diversity.&quot; Despite the irony of a communist newspaper being rescued by private capital, some of which supported right-wing politics, director Patrick Le Hyaric described the sale as &quot;a matter of life or death.&quot;

Since 2001, there has been speculation that would cease as a daily newspaper. However, in contrast to most French newspapers, its publication has actually since increased to about 75,000.

===After 2001===
In 2006, the paper created a weekly edition, . The same year had a circulation of 52,800 copies. In 2008, it sold its headquarters due to financial problems and called for donations. More than €2 million had been donated by the end of 2008. In 2020, had a circulation of 39,522 copies.

==Fête de l&#x27;Humanité==
The newspaper organizes the annual &quot;Fête de l&#x27;Humanité&quot; festival as a fundraising event.

<doc id="570875" wikidata="Q4826885" url="?curid=570875" title="Autopatch">
<text>An autopatch, sometimes called a phone patch, is a feature of an amateur radio (or other type of two-way radio) repeater or base station to access an outgoing telephone connection. Users with a transceiver capable of producing touch tones (DTMF signals) can make a telephone call, typically limited by settings in the autopatch module to be only to flat-rate numbers, such as local calls or toll-free numbers.

== Phonepatch vs. mobile telephony ==
The fact of connecting a ham radio station to a telephone network exists from the beginning of the ham radio operators, even commercially, as the case of Carterfone (with lawsuits filed by the companies to which it was connected), but it was not possible to talk about mobile telephony until the arrival of the cellular network AMPS, initially using a car phone as the cellular terminal, and finally with the arrival of the DynaTAC, the first mobile phone &quot;properly talking&quot; (being able to hold the whole unit in the hand).

The term &quot;phone patch&quot; more accurately describes a system that is dialed and connected to the telephone network by a user manually operating a ham radio base station, which was more common before computer technology made automation of the process easier.

== Uses ==
This feature is primarily used by radio amateurs to provide emergency telephone connectivity to places that have lost their telephone network access. An amateur radio operator with a transceiver installed in their vehicle may provide telephone network access from dozens of miles away, depending on the frequencies of the involved repeater/base station, the power of the transceiver, band conditions, and the gain of the antennas on both ends.

In the United States, autopatch users are required to hang up if they encounter music on hold, as the Federal Communications Commission regulations prohibit music on amateur radio frequencies.

<doc id="570883" wikidata="Q1023772" url="?curid=570883" title="CIV (band)">
<text>CIV was an American punk rock band from New York City. The band is named after its vocalist, Anthony Civarelli. Three of the band&#x27;s members (Civarelli, Siegler and Smilios) were members of Gorilla Biscuits. Siegler also played in other hardcore bands, including Youth of Today and Judge.

After the break-up of Gorilla Biscuits, Civarelli opened a tattoo studio on Long Island. After the band Quicksand had signed to a major label, Schreifels re-united a late version of his former band, wrote a record and produced it, resulting in &quot;Set Your Goals&quot;. Smilios was replaced by Cache Tolman prior to the recording of their second full-length album, &quot;Thirteen Day Getaway&quot;. Shortly after releasing &quot;Thirteen Day Getaway&quot;, CIV disbanded in 2000. They have since reunited for a series of one-off shows, including New York&#x27;s Black N Blue Bowl in 2008 and Belgium&#x27;s Groezrock Festival in 2011. CIV had yet another reunion on September 7, 2012 at the Webster Hall in New York City. Announced in 2024, CIV reunited once more to support Shelter on a four night tour of the Northeast. The band played a one off show in The Netherlands in November of 2024. 

==Legacy==
CIV is known for the single &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait One Minute More&quot;, which was released as a music video which was featured on &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot; and used in a Nissan automobile commercial during the middle of 2005. Lou Koller from hardcore band Sick of It All provided additional vocal tracks for the song. Songs &quot;All Twisted&quot;, &quot;Haven&#x27;t Been Myself in a While&quot;, and &quot;Something Special&quot; were also featured on the TV Show &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot;. Their early track &quot;Et Tu Brute?&quot; is featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;. Their track &quot;So Far, So Good...So What&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack album to the cartoon series &quot;Mega Man&quot; which is based on the video game series of the same name by Capcom, and it was also played during the end credits of the episode &quot;Brain Bots&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Not Your Fault&quot; and &quot;Living Life&quot; can be found in &quot;Road Rash 3D&quot;.

The San Francisco Bay-area pop punk/hardcore band Set Your Goals is named after CIV&#x27;s first album of the same name.

<doc id="570888" wikidata="Q4353101" url="?curid=570888" title="HMS Achilles (F12)">
<text>HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was built by Yarrow at Glasgow. She was launched on 21 November 1968 and commissioned on 9 July 1970. She was sold to Chile in 1991 and served in the Chilean Navy as &quot;Ministro Zenteno&quot;. She was washed away from her berth at Talcahuano by a tsunami following the February 2010 Chile earthquake, and ran aground on the coast a few kilometres to the north. She was scuttled the following month by the Chilean Navy as a danger to navigation.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Achilles&quot; was one of two Batch 3, &quot;Broad-Beamed&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders in early 1967, the other being and . She was laid down on 1 December 1967, launched on 21 November 1968 and completed on 9 July 1970, commissioning on 11 July with the Pennant number &quot;F12&quot;.

&quot;Achilles&quot; was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. A single Sea Cat surface-to-air missile launcher was fitted aft (on the Helicopter hangar roof), while two Oerlikon 20mm cannon provided close-in defence. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

&quot;Achilles&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 184 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar.

==Service history==
In 1970, &quot;Achilles&quot; deployed to the Far East where there was, at that time, a large British naval presence. She escorted a number of larger vessels while there, including the aircraft carrier .

In 1974, &quot;Achilles&quot; joined the 3rd Frigate Squadron, and later that year deployed to the Far East on a nine-month deployment as part of Task Group 317.2. The task group visited a number of African ports on their way to the Far East and Indian Ocean, including South Africa, a visit that caused some controversy back in the UK at the time. The task group visited a variety of ports in the Far East and took part in a number of exercises. &quot;Achilles&quot; was active as a radio relay vessel during the fall of South Vietnam.

Upon the task group&#x27;s return from the Far East, they made their way around the Cape of Good Hope to South America where a large exercise with the Brazilian Navy took place, which included the aircraft carrier . &quot;Achilles&quot; returned to the UK in June 1975.

On 12 November 1975, &quot;Achilles&quot; collided with the Greek tanker &quot;Olympic Alliance&quot; in heavy fog in the Dover Strait, causing a number of injuries aboard &quot;Achilles&quot; together with heavy damage to the frigate&#x27;s bow, while a large oil slick was released from the tanker into the Channel. &quot;Achilles&quot; was under repair at Devonport Dockyard until March 1976, with her complete bow section needing to be replaced. The following year, &quot;Achilles&quot; joined the Fishery Protection Squadron during the Third Cod War with Iceland, spending one week on patrol. During that year also, HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; was covertly deployed to Belize during the Guatemalan emergency.

After her deployment during the Third Cod War, &quot;Achilles&quot; went on a number of deployments including to the Persian Gulf as well as being involved in a number of naval exercises.

&quot;Achilles&quot; was intended to be modernised, (probably involving removal of her one 4.5-inch twin gun, which would have been replaced by the Exocet anti-ship missile and Sea Wolf anti-aircraft missiles, but possibly also involving fitting of a towed array sonar), but the modernisation was cancelled due to the 1981 Defence Review by the minister, John Nott, and it was instead planned to dispose of the unmodernised frigate, despite the long life remaining in her hull. In 1982, &quot;Achilles&quot; deployed to the West Indies as guardship. The following year, she deployed to the Falkland Islands to patrol the area in the aftermath of the Falklands War. Later that year &quot;Achilles&quot; took part in Exercise Orient Express, which took place in the Indian Ocean. She deployed to the Persian Gulf that same year.

By the late 1980s, &quot;Achilles&quot; career was coming to an end. In 1989 she joined the Dartmouth Training Squadron, and in a busy year became the first Royal Navy warship to visit East Germany as well as hosting a dinner to mark the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the River Plate. In January 1990 &quot;Achilles&quot; decommissioned, ending her career, though only with the Royal Navy. However, the name &quot;Achilles&quot; lives on as TS &quot;Achilles&quot;, the Trowbridge branch of the Sea Cadet Corps. Sold to the Chilean Navy in 1991, she served until 2006 with the name &quot;Ministro Zenteno&quot;. From 2006 until late February 2010 she was in reserve.

==Fate==
On 27 February 2010 a tsunami associated with the 2010 Chile earthquake washed her several nautical miles from her berth in the Talcahuano naval base, towards the coastal city of Dichato. In March 2010, the Chilean Navy decided to sink the ship to ensure free navigation in the area where the ship had run aground. The mission was performed by the crew of the offshore patrol vessel &quot;Piloto Pardo&quot;.

<doc id="570913" wikidata="Q892498" url="?curid=570913" title="Harrah's Entertainment">
<text>Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment (later named Caesars Entertainment Corporation, previously The Promus Companies) was an American casino and hotel company founded in Reno, Nevada, and based in Paradise, Nevada, that operated over 50 properties and seven golf courses under several brands. In 2013, it was the fourth-largest gambling company in the world, with annual revenues of $8.6 billion. It was acquired in 2020 by Eldorado Resorts, which then changed its own name to Caesars Entertainment.

At the end of its existence, Caesars was a public company, majority-owned by a group of private equity firms led by Apollo Global Management, TPG Capital, and Paulson &amp; Co.; and Carl Icahn. Caesars&#x27;s largest operating unit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2015, which led to the foundation of Vici Properties as a result.

==History==
===William F. Harrah era (1937–1978)===
The company&#x27;s background can be traced to October 29, 1937, when Bill Harrah opened a small bingo parlor in Reno, Nevada, a predecessor to Harrah&#x27;s Reno. In 1955, he expanded to Stateline, Nevada, on the south shore of Lake Tahoe, where he would eventually open Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe.

Harrah&#x27;s Inc. made its initial public offering in 1971. In 1972, it was listed on the American Stock Exchange and in 1973, Harrah&#x27;s became the first casino company listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 1978, Bill Harrah died at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, at the age of 66, during a cardiac surgery operation to repair an aortic aneurysm.

===Under Holiday Inn===
In February 1980, Holiday Inn acquired Harrah&#x27;s, Inc. for $300 million. Liquidation of Harrah&#x27;s collection of almost 7,000 antique automobiles reportedly returned the full purchase price of the company to Holiday Inn. Holiday Inn at the time had interests in two casinos: the under-construction Holiday Inn Marina Casino in Atlantic City, and a 40 percent stake in the Holiday Casino, adjacent to the Holiday Inn hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.

In July 1987, Bill&#x27;s Casino Lake Tahoe opened. Harrah&#x27;s Laughlin opened in August 1988.

===The Promus Companies===
The company that would become Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment was formed in 1990 as The Promus Companies. To effect the sale of the Holiday Inn hotel business to Bass PLC, Promus was created as a corporate spin-off, holding Harrah&#x27;s, Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites, and Hampton Inn; Bass then acquired Holiday Corp., which retained only the Holiday Inn assets. The next year, the company&#x27;s headquarters moved from Reno to Memphis, Tennessee.

In April 1992, the Holiday Casino was rebranded as Harrah&#x27;s Las Vegas.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a rapid increase in gambling markets with the growth of Indian gaming and legalization of riverboat casinos. In 1993 and 1994, the company opened Harrah&#x27;s Joliet, Harrah&#x27;s Vicksburg, Harrah&#x27;s Tunica, Harrah&#x27;s Black Hawk, Harrah&#x27;s Central City, Harrah&#x27;s Shreveport, Harrah&#x27;s North Kansas City, and Harrah&#x27;s Ak-Chin.

===Renamed as Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment===
In 1995, Promus decided to spin off its non-gaming hotel businesses, in part because they had been undervalued by investors due to perception of the company as a risky gaming stock. Promus Hotel Corp. was established, holding Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn, and Homewood Suites, while the parent company, holding 16 casinos, was renamed as Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment.

Harrah&#x27;s continued its expansion over the next ten years, opening Harrah&#x27;s Skagit Valley, SkyCity Auckland, Harrah&#x27;s St. Louis-Riverport, Harrah&#x27;s Cherokee, Harrah&#x27;s Prairie Band, Harrah&#x27;s New Orleans, and Harrah&#x27;s Rincon, and acquiring the Southern Belle Casino, Showboat, Inc., the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino, Players International, Harveys Casino Resorts, Louisiana Downs, Horseshoe Gaming, and the World Series of Poker.

On September 4, 1997, Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment launched its Total Gold loyalty program (renamed as Total Rewards on April 4, 2000 and again as Caesars Rewards on February 1, 2019), developed at a cost of $20 million. It was the first gaming company to offer a systemwide comps program, allowing points earned at one casino to be redeemed for goods and services at any of the company&#x27;s other casinos. The system would be credited as a major driver of Harrah&#x27;s growth over the coming years.

Harvard Business School professor Gary Loveman joined Harrah&#x27;s as chief operating officer in 1998, and would go on to serve as chief executive officer from 2003 to 2015.

In 1999, the company moved its headquarters from Memphis to Las Vegas.

===Purchase of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.===

Harrah&#x27;s made its largest single expansion in 2005, when it acquired Caesars Entertainment, Inc. for $10.4 billion. Negotiations were spurred on by news of a merger agreement between MGM Mirage and Mandalay Resort Group. The two companies sold several properties ahead of the merger to assuage antitrust concerns, including Harrah&#x27;s East Chicago and Harrah&#x27;s Mardi Gras. The acquisition increased Harrah&#x27;s portfolio to 40 casinos, plus four cruise ship casinos. The deal furthered Harrah&#x27;s goal of gaining a larger presence on the Las Vegas Strip, where Caesars owned four casinos, and improved its ability to market to high rollers.

Harrah&#x27;s began to push for a larger international presence in 2005, announcing joint venture agreements to build casinos in Spain, Slovenia, and the Bahamas, and applying for a license to build a major resort in Singapore, though none of these projects would come to fruition. Harrah&#x27;s also acquired London Clubs International in 2006, and the Macau Orient Golf club in 2007.

From 2005 to 2010, the company consolidated control of a long stretch of the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, acquiring the Bourbon Street, Imperial Palace, Barbary Coast, and Planet Hollywood casinos, along with large tracts of land behind the Strip properties.

In 2005 and 2006, Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment closed its Lake Charles casino due to damage from Hurricane Rita, sold the Flamingo Laughlin and sold Grand Casino Gulfport.

===Company goes private===
Loveman at some point sought advice from private equity tycoon David Bonderman about the possibility of spinning off ownership of Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment real estate as a separate real estate investment trust (REIT), hoping to attain the higher price-to-earnings ratios at which hotel companies traded, compared to gaming companies. In 2006, the discussions evolved toward the idea of a leveraged buyout of Harrah&#x27;s by Bonderman&#x27;s company, TPG Capital. Another private equity firm, Apollo Global Management, approached Loveman about a buyout and he encouraged them to collaborate with TPG. By the end of the year, an agreement was announced for the two companies to buy Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment for $17.1 billion in cash plus $10.7 billion in assumed debt. The transaction closed in January 2008, leaving Harrah&#x27;s with $25.1 billion in debt.

===The Linq===
It was widely announced in previous years that the company planned to implode properties and build new ones from scratch, but after the market downturn the company conceded that it had little experience in building major resorts. Instead it developed Project LINQ in 2009, which would add 20 restaurants and bars between the company&#x27;s Imperial Palace, O&#x27;Sheas and Flamingo casinos, on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip. The goal was to create an entertainment district similar to what had developed organically in Los Angeles, Memphis and New Orleans but did not yet exist on the Strip, with its enclosed and casino-centric zones. It provided competition for the Fremont Street Experience.

===Las Vegas Arena===
The Anschutz Entertainment Group first tried to build an arena in Las Vegas in association with Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment. In 2007, the joint venture announced they would build a 20,000-seat stadium behind the Bally&#x27;s and Paris casino-hotels. Caesars Entertainment, Inc. had previously envisioned using the location to build a baseball park, but the company&#x27;s buyout by Harrah&#x27;s cancelled the plans. Through the following year, Harrah&#x27;s got uncertain on continuing with the project, not knowing if AEG would split the costs and whether building a major league-ready stadium without a guaranteed franchise to play on it would be feasible given the enduring financial crisis. The original plans were to break ground in June 2008 and finish the arena in 2010, but by 2009, it was revealed the stalled project had not even done a traffic study despite being located near a busy intersection. In 2010, the plans were changed to use an area behind the Imperial Palace. However, given the financing would require a special taxation district, opposition from the Clark County Commission regarding using public money in the project stalled it even further. AEG eventually backed out completely by 2012, once MGM Resorts International came up with their own project using a terrain behind the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. This attracted AEG primarily for not relying on public funding.

The acquisition of Planet Hollywood provided Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment with a contiguous property bordering the strip. The vacant lots behind the casinos had been slated for a sports arena large enough to hold a professional basketball or hockey team. The three casinos will have over 8,000 rooms which can be directly connected to the arena.

It was announced in August 2010 that Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment would run casinos in Cincinnati and Cleveland in Ohio when they opened in 2012.

===Renamed as Caesars Entertainment Corporation===
On November 23, 2010, plans for an IPO were canceled, but a planned name change from Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment to Caesars Entertainment Corporation did go forward and was made official on the same day. This change was intended to capitalize on the international name recognition of the Caesars brand. The Harrah&#x27;s brand would remain one of the company&#x27;s three primary casino brands.

On February 8, 2012, an initial public offering took place, with the common stock trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol &quot;CZR.&quot;

===Caesars Acquisition Company merger===
On December 22, 2014, Caesars announced its intention to acquire Caesars Acquisition Company. Under the terms of the transaction, shareholders of Caesars Acquisition Company would receive 0.664 share of Caesars Entertainment common stock for each share of Caesars Acquisition Company held.

===Casino unit files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy===
The casino operating unit, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. and approximately 170 of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 15, 2015. The casino unit&#x27;s parent company, Caesars Entertainment Corporation, did not file for bankruptcy protection. The casino operating group&#x27;s investors initiated litigation against the parent company, Caesars Entertainment Corporation&#x27;s over the parent company&#x27;s debt guarantees. Vici Properties was founded as a result.

On November 2, 2015, Rock Gaming announced it would begin assuming management of Horseshoe Casino Cleveland, Horseshoe Casino Cincinnati and ThistleDown Racino from Caesars Entertainment and complete the transition by June 2016.

===Playtika Company acquisition and sale===
Caesars acquired Playtika in May 2011 for an amount between $80 and $90 million. Playtika, a social game developer company, was founded in 2010 by Robert Antokol and Uri Shahak and produced Facebook social gaming platforms (slotomania.com &amp; caesarsgames.com). In June 2016, a Chinese consortium, which included Alibaba chief Jack Ma&#x27;s Yunfeng Capital, agreed to purchase it in a buyout for $4.4 billion.

On November 29, 2017, Caesars announced it was selling Harrah&#x27;s Las Vegas to Vici Properties while Caesars continued to operate it. The same day, they announced that they were buying Centaur Gaming. In addition, they were building a new convention center in Las Vegas named Caesars Forum.

===Caesars and Eldorado merger===
In February 2019, Turner Sports announced an agreement with Caesars to provide sports betting content for its sports news website &quot;Bleacher Report&quot;, including a dedicated studio at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

On March 17, 2019, it was announced that Caesars Entertainment Corporation and Eldorado Resorts were exploring a merger of the two companies. On June 23, 2019, Caesars officially accepted Eldorado&#x27;s offer, reported to be worth almost $8.6 billion. Caesars controlled 53 assets compared to Eldorado&#x27;s 26. After completion of the merger, 5 board members would come from Caesars and 6 would come from Eldorado.

In May 2019, ESPN announced a partnership with Caesars Entertainment, in which it would be the exclusive provider of sports odds across its programming, and ESPN would construct a Las Vegas studio at The Linq devoted to sports betting-oriented programming.

On April 16, 2019, Caesars announced that Affinity Gaming CEO Anthony Rodio would become the CEO of Caesars within 30 days, replacing Mark Frissora, who announced his intention to step down in November 2018. Rodio came recommended by investor Carl Icahn, who owned almost 100 million shares (a 28.5% stake in Caesars as of June 17, 2019) and had reportedly been pushing Caesars to sell the company.

Shareholders of Caesars and Eldorado approved the merger on November 15, 2019, and it was completed in July 2020.

===Fines and settlements===
In 2015 the US Treasury&#x27;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) fined Caesars Entertainment&#x27;s Las Vegas casino $8 million for failing to properly police transactions for illicit activity. A 2012 IRS examination found Caesars had failed to report to the authorities over 100 incidents involving potential criminal activity. The Nevada Gaming Control Board announced a related $1.5 million penalty.

Caesars Entertainment was censured by the UK&#x27;s Gambling Commission in 2015 for lax money-laundering controls in at two of its London casinos. Caesars entered into a voluntary settlement, agreeing to improve its anti-money laundering processes and making a payment of £875,000 to be used for “socially responsible purposes”.

In 2020 the UK Gambling Commission fined Caesars Entertainment EMEA a record £13m for failures relating to VIP schemes. The failures included allowing a customer to lose £323,000 in 12 months, despite showing signs of gambling addiction. Caesars was also found guilty of failing to prevent money laundering, and failing to check the source of funds of someone who bet £3.5m in three months, and a politically exposed person (PEP) who lost £795,000 in just over a year. Three senior managers lost their licence to run a gambling business.

===Sale===
In April 2020, Twin River Worldwide Holdings announced a deal with Caesars Entertainment and Vici Properties to purchase Bally&#x27;s Atlantic City in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

<text>Action at a distance is the concept in physics that an object&#x27;s motion can be affected by another object without the two being in physical contact; that is, it is the concept of the non-local interaction of objects that are separated in space. Coulomb&#x27;s law and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation are based on action at a distance.

Historically, action at a distance was the earliest scientific model for gravity and electricity and it continues to be useful in many practical cases. In the 19th and 20th centuries, field models arose to explain these phenomena with more precision. The discovery of electrons and of special relativity led to new action at a distance models providing alternative to field theories. Under our modern understanding, the four fundamental interactions (gravity, electromagnetism, the strong interaction and the weak interaction) in all of physics are not described by action at a distance.

== Categories of action ==
In the study of mechanics, action at a distance is one of three fundamental actions on matter that cause motion. The other two are direct impact (elastic or inelastic collisions) and actions in a continuous medium as in fluid mechanics or solid mechanics. 
Historically, physical explanations for particular phenomena have moved between these three categories over time as new models were developed.

Action-at-a-distance and actions in a continuous medium may be easily distinguished when the medium dynamics are visible, like waves in water or in an elastic solid. In the case of electricity or gravity, no medium is required. In the nineteenth century, criteria like the effect of actions on intervening matter, the observation of a time delay, the apparent storage of energy, or even the possibility of a plausible mechanical model for action transmission were all accepted as evidence against action at a distance. Aether theories were alternative proposals to replace apparent action-at-a-distance in gravity and electromagnetism, in terms of continuous action inside an (invisible) medium called &quot;aether&quot;.

Direct impact of macroscopic objects seems visually distinguishable from action at a distance. If however the objects are constructed of atoms, and the volume of those atoms is not defined and atoms interact by electric and magnetic forces, the distinction is less clear.

== Roles ==
The concept of action at a distance acts in multiple roles in physics and it can co-exist with other models according to the needs of each physical problem.

One role is as a summary of physical phenomena, independent of any understanding of the cause of such an action. For example, astronomical tables of planetary positions can be compactly summarized using Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, which assumes the planets interact without contact or an intervening medium. As a summary of data, the concept does not need to be evaluated as a plausible physical model. 

Action at a distance also acts as a model explaining physical phenomena even in the presence of other models. Again in the case of gravity, hypothesizing an instantaneous force between masses allows the return time of comets to be predicted as well as predicting the existence of previously unknown planets, like Neptune. These triumphs of physics predated the alternative more accurate model for gravity based on general relativity by many decades.

Introductory physics textbooks discuss central forces, like gravity, by models based on action-at-distance without discussing the cause of such forces or issues with it until the topics of relativity and fields are discussed. For example, see &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; on gravity.

== History ==
=== Early inquiries into motion ===

Action-at-a-distance as a physical concept requires identifying objects, distances, and their motion. In antiquity, ideas about the natural world were not organized in these terms. Objects in motion were modeled as living beings. Around 1600, the scientific method began to take root. René Descartes held a more fundamental view, developing ideas of matter and action independent of theology. Galileo Galilei wrote about experimental measurements of falling and rolling objects. Johannes Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion summarized Tycho Brahe&#x27;s astronomical observations. Many experiments with electrical and magnetic materials led to new ideas about forces. These efforts set the stage for Newton&#x27;s work on forces and gravity.

=== Newtonian gravity ===

In 1687 Isaac Newton published his &quot;Principia&quot; which combined his laws of motion with a new mathematical analysis able to reproduce Kepler&#x27;s empirical results. His explanation was in the form of a law of universal gravitation: any two bodies are attracted by a force proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Thus the motions of planets were predicted by assuming forces working over great distances.

This mathematical expression of the force did not imply a cause. Newton considered action-at-a-distance to be an inadequate model for gravity. Newton, in his words, considered action at a distance to be:

Metaphysical scientists of the early 1700s strongly objected to the unexplained action-at-a-distance in Newton&#x27;s theory. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz complained that the mechanism of gravity was &quot;invisible, intangible, and not mechanical&quot;. Moreover, initial comparisons with astronomical data were not favorable. As mathematical techniques improved throughout the 1700s, the theory showed increasing success, predicting the date of the return of Halley&#x27;s comet and aiding the discovery of planet Neptune in 1846. These successes and the increasingly empirical focus of science towards the 19th century led to acceptance of Newton&#x27;s theory of gravity despite distaste for action-at-a-distance.

=== Electrical action at a distance ===
Electrical and magnetic phenomena also began to be explored systematically in the early 1600s. In William Gilbert&#x27;s early theory of &quot;electric effluvia,&quot; a kind of electric atmosphere, he rules out action-at-a-distance on the grounds that &quot;no action can be performed by matter save by contact&quot;. 
However subsequent experiments, especially those by Stephen Gray showed electrical effects over distance. Gray developed an experiment call the &quot;electric boy&quot; demonstrating electric transfer without direct contact.
Franz Aepinus was the first to show, in 1759, that a theory of action at a distance for electricity provides a simpler replacement for the electric effluvia theory. Despite this success, Aepinus himself considered the nature of the forces to be unexplained: he did &quot;not approve of the doctrine which assumes the possibility of action at a distance&quot;, setting the stage for a shift to theories based on aether.

By 1785 Charles-Augustin de Coulomb showed that two electric charges at rest experience a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, a result now called Coulomb&#x27;s law. The striking similarity to gravity strengthened the case for action at a distance, at least as a mathematical model.

As mathematical methods improved, especially through the work of Pierre-Simon Laplace, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, and Siméon Denis Poisson, more sophisticated mathematical methods began to influence the thinking of scientists. The concept of potential energy applied to small test particles led to the concept of a scalar field, a mathematical model representing the forces throughout space. While this mathematical model is not a mechanical medium, the mental picture of such a field resembles a medium.

=== Fields as an alternative ===

Michael Faraday was the first who suggested that action at a distance was inadequate as an account of electric and magnetic forces, even in the form of a (mathematical) potential field. Faraday, an empirical experimentalist, cited three reasons in support of some medium transmitting electrical force: 1) electrostatic induction across an insulator depends on the nature of the insulator, 2) cutting a charged insulator causes opposite charges to appear on each half, and 3) electric discharge sparks are curved at an insulator. From these reasons he concluded that the particles of an insulator must be polarized, with each particle contributing to continuous action. He also experimented with magnets, demonstrating lines of force made visible by iron filings. However, in both cases his field-like model depends on particles that interact through an action-at-a-distance: his mechanical field-like model has no more fundamental physical cause than the long-range central field model.

Faraday&#x27;s observations, as well as others, led James Clerk Maxwell to a breakthrough formulation in 1865, a set of equations that combined electricity and magnetism, both static and dynamic, and which included electromagnetic radiation – light. Maxwell started with elaborate mechanical models but ultimately produced a purely mathematical treatment using dynamical vector fields. The sense that these fields must be set to vibrate to propagate light set off a search of a medium of propagation; the medium was called the luminiferous aether or the aether.

In 1873 Maxwell addressed action at a distance explicitly. He reviews Faraday&#x27;s lines of force, carefully pointing out that Faraday himself did not provide a mechanical model of these lines in terms of a medium. Nevertheless the many properties of these lines of force imply these &quot;lines must not be regarded as mere mathematical abstractions&quot;. Faraday himself viewed these lines of force as a model, a &quot;valuable aid&quot; to the experimentalist, a means to suggest further experiments. 

In distinguishing between different kinds of action Faraday suggested three criteria: 1) do additional material objects alter the action?, 2) does the action take time, and 3) does it depend upon the receiving end? For electricity, Faraday knew that all three criteria were met for electric action, but gravity was thought to only meet the third one. After Maxwell&#x27;s time a fourth criteria, the transmission of energy, was added, thought to also apply to electricity but not gravity. With the advent of new theories of gravity, the modern account would give gravity all of the criteria except dependence on additional objects.

=== Fields fade into spacetime ===

The success of Maxwell&#x27;s field equations led to numerous efforts in the later decades of the 19th century to represent electrical, magnetic, and gravitational fields, primarily with mechanical models. No model emerged that explained the existing phenomena. In particular no good model for stellar aberration, the shift in the position of stars with the Earth&#x27;s relative velocity. The best models required the ether to be stationary while the Earth moved, but experimental efforts to measure the effect of Earth&#x27;s motion through the aether found no effect. 

In 1892 Hendrik Lorentz proposed a modified aether based on the emerging microscopic molecular model rather than the strictly macroscopic continuous theory of Maxwell. Lorentz investigated the mutual interaction of a moving solitary electrons within a stationary aether. He rederived Maxwell&#x27;s equations in this way but, critically, in the process he changed them to represent the wave in the coordinates moving electrons. He showed that the wave equations had the same form if they were transformed using a particular scaling factor,
formula_1 
where formula_2 is the velocity of the moving electrons and formula_3 is the speed of light. Lorentz noted that if this factor were applied as a length contraction to moving matter in a stationary ether, it would eliminate any effect of motion through the ether, in agreement with experiment. 

In 1899, Henri Poincaré questioned the existence of an aether, showing that the principle of relativity prohibits the absolute motion assumed by proponents of the aether model. He named the transformation used by Lorentz the Lorentz transformation but interpreted it as a transformation between two inertial frames with relative velocity formula_2. This transformation makes the electromagnetic equations look the same in every uniformly moving inertial frame. Then, in 1905, Albert Einstein demonstrated that the principle of relativity, applied to the simultaneity of time and the constant speed of light, precisely predicts the Lorentz transformation. This theory of special relativity quickly became the modern concept of spacetime.

Thus the aether model, initially so very different from action at a distance, slowly changed to 
resemble simple empty space. 

In 1905, Poincaré proposed gravitational waves, emanating from a body and propagating at the speed of light, as being required by the Lorentz transformations and suggested that, in analogy to an accelerating electrical charge producing electromagnetic waves, accelerated masses in a relativistic field theory of gravity should produce gravitational waves. However, until 1915 gravity stood apart as a force still described by action-at-a-distance. In that year, Einstein showed that a field theory of spacetime, general relativity, consistent with relativity can explain gravity. New effects resulting from this theory were dramatic for cosmology but minor for planetary motion and physics on Earth.
Einstein himself noted Newton&#x27;s &quot;enormous practical success&quot;.

== Modern action at a distance ==

In the early decades of the 20th century, Karl Schwarzschild, Hugo Tetrode, and Adriaan Fokker independently developed non-instantaneous models for action at a distance consistent with special relativity. In 1949 John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman built on these models to develop a new field-free theory of electromagnetism.
While Maxwell&#x27;s field equations are generally successful, the Lorentz model of a moving electron interacting with the field encounters mathematical difficulties: the self-energy of the moving point charge within the field is infinite. The Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electromagnetism avoids the self-energy issue. They interpret Abraham–Lorentz force, the apparent force resisting electron acceleration, as a real force returning from all the other existing charges in the universe.

The Wheeler–Feynman theory has inspired new thinking about the arrow of time and about the nature of quantum non-locality. The theory has implications for cosmology; it has been extended to quantum mechanics. A similar approach has been applied to develop an alternative theory of gravity consistent with general relativity. John G. Cramer has extended the Wheeler–Feynman ideas to create the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics.

== &quot;Spooky action at a distance&quot; ==

Albert Einstein wrote to Max Born about issues in quantum mechanics in 1947 and used a phrase translated as &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;, and in 1964, John Stewart Bell proved that quantum mechanics predicted stronger statistical correlations in the outcomes of certain far-apart measurements than any local theory possibly could. The phrase has been picked up and used as a description for the cause of small non-classical correlations between physically separated measurement of entangled quantum states. The correlations are predicted by quantum mechanics (the Bell theorem) and verified by experiments (the Bell test). Rather than a postulate like Newton&#x27;s gravitational force, this use of &quot;action-at-a-distance&quot; concerns observed correlations which cannot be explained with localized particle-based models. Describing these correlations as &quot;action-at-a-distance&quot; requires assuming that particles became entangled and then traveled to distant locations, an assumption that is not required by quantum mechanics.

== Force in quantum field theory ==

Quantum field theory does not need action at a distance. At the most fundamental level, only four forces are needed. Each force is described as resulting from the exchange of specific bosons. Two are short range: the strong interaction mediated by mesons and the weak interaction mediated by the weak boson; two are long range: electromagnetism mediated by the photon and gravity hypothesized to be mediated by the graviton. However, the entire concept of force is of secondary concern in advanced modern particle physics. Energy forms the basis of physical models and the word action has shifted away from implying a force to a specific technical meaning, an integral over the difference between potential energy and kinetic energy.

<text>Cornwall is a Canadian town located in Queens County, Prince Edward Island. The town is located immediately west of the provincial capital Charlottetown.

==History==
The community of Cornwall traces its history to European settlement in the 18th century and was a predominantly farming community until the construction of Route 1, the Trans-Canada Highway, during the early 1910s. Several subdivisions were created near the intersection of the new highway with the Meadowbank Road, along with a small commercial strip.

On April 1, 1995, the incorporated communities of Cornwall, Eliot River, and North River amalgamated to form the Town of Cornwall.

The amalgamation did not see many controversies. The name of the community of Cornwall survived although the legislation designated the new town as Charlottetown West but amid the call of some residents for a new community name, as was occurring in the case of Stratford (also amalgamated at the same time as Charlottetown South), the community decided to rename the town Cornwall once again.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Cornwall had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Education==
The town of Cornwall is home to three English Language School Board schools: 
* Westwood Primary School
* Eliot River Elementary School
* East Wiltshire Junior High
Students graduate East Wiltshire and go on to attend Bluefield High School in Hampshire for grades 10 to 12.

==Economy==
The town established the Cornwall Business Park in 1997.

== Notable people ==
*Jared Connaughton, sprinter, Olympian, 2005 Canada Games gold medalist 100m &amp; 200m

<doc id="570934" wikidata="Q6917303" url="?curid=570934" title="Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church">
<text>The Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church is a historic church and congregation which is located at 419 South 6th Street in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The congregation, founded in 1794, is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal congregation in the nation.

Its present church, completed in 1890, is the oldest church property in the United States to be continuously owned by African Americans. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1972.

==History of the congregation==

The church was proposed in 1791 by members of the Free African Society of Philadelphia, including Absalom Jones, out of a desire to create a space for autonomous African-American worship and community in the city. The desire to create the church was strengthened in 1792, after African-American members of St. George&#x27;s Methodist Church walked out due to racial segregation in the worship services. Leading roles in the founding were played by Richard Allen, who arranged the purchase of the church&#x27;s site and its construction, and Absalom Jones, who raised funds among both black and white Philadelphia residents (including then-President George Washington). Mother Bethel was one of the first African-American churches in the United States, dedicated July 29, 1794, by Bishop Francis Asbury.

On October 12, 1794, Reverend Robert Blackwell announced that the congregation was received in full fellowship in the Methodist Episcopal Church.

In 1816, Rev. Richard Allen brought together other black Methodist congregations from the region to organize the new African Methodist Episcopal Church denomination. He was elected bishop of this denomination. After the American Civil War, its missionaries went to the South to help freedmen and planted many new churches in the region.

In 1838, the building was damaged during the riots that followed the destruction of Pennsylvania Hall.

Allen and his wife, Sarah Allen are both buried in the present church&#x27;s crypt. The current church building was constructed in 1888–1890, and it has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

On October 25, 2009, &quot;The Great Gathering&quot; took place at St. George&#x27;s Church in which the community of Mother Bethel AME and St. George&#x27;s congregations gathered for Sunday worship at St. George&#x27;s for the first time since the historic walkout. The Rev. Dr. Mark Kelly Tyler preached for this service.

==Building history==
The property was acquired for the new congregation in 1794. Its first building was a frame structure originally used as a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, which was hauled to the site.

This building was later replaced by frame structures in 1805 and 1841. The 1841 church was reported to have a tunnel connecting it with a nearby Quaker meetinghouse to facilitate the movements of fugitive slaves.

The present building, which was completed in 1890, is a three-story masonry structure with Romanesque styling. Its large round-arch windows are adorned with stained glass from Germany.

<text>In economics, effective demand (ED) in a market is the demand for a product or service which occurs when purchasers are constrained in a different market. It contrasts with notional demand, which is the demand that occurs when purchasers are not constrained in any other market. In the aggregated market for goods in general, demand, notional or effective, is referred to as aggregate demand. The concept of effective supply parallels the concept of effective demand. The concept of effective demand or supply becomes relevant when markets do not continuously maintain equilibrium prices.

== Examples of spillovers ==
One example involves spillovers from the labor market to the goods market. If there is labour market disequilibrium such that individuals cannot supply all the labor they want to supply, then the amount that they are able to supply will influence their demand for goods; the demand for goods, contingent on the constraint on the amount of labor that can be supplied, is their effective demand for goods. In contrast, if there were no labor market disequilibrium, individuals would simultaneously choose both their quantity of labor to supply and the quantity of goods to purchase, and the latter would be their notional demand for goods. In this example, the effective demand for goods would be less than the notional demand for goods.

Conversely, if there are goods market shortages, individuals may choose to supply less labor (and enjoy more leisure) than they would in the absence of goods market disequilibrium. The amount of labor they choose to supply, contingent on the constraint on the number of goods they can buy, is the effective supply of labor.

Another example involves spillovers from credit markets to the goods market. If there is credit rationing, some individuals are constrained in the number of funds they can borrow to finance goods purchases (including consumer durables and houses), so their effective demand for goods, as a function of this constraint, is less than their notional demand for goods (the amount they would buy if they could borrow all they want to).

Firms can also exhibit effective demands or supplies that differ from notional demands or supplies. They too can be credit constrained, resulting in their effective demand for goods such as physical capital differing from their notional demand. In addition, in a time of labor shortage, they are constrained in how much labor they can employ; therefore the number of goods they choose to supply at any potential goods price—their effective supply of goods—will be less than their notional supply. And if firms are constrained by excess supply in the goods market, limiting how much goods they can sell, then their effective demand for labor will be less than their notional demand for labor.

The excess demands in different markets can influence each other. The presence of excess demand in one market influences effective demand or supply in another market, which may influence the degree of disequilibrium in the latter market; in turn, the constraints imposed on participants in that market influence their effective demand or supply in the former market.

==History==
Classical economist David Ricardo embraced Say&#x27;s law, suggesting, in Keynes&#x27;s formulation, that &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;. According to Say&#x27;s law, for every excess supply (glut) of goods in one market, there is a corresponding excess demand (shortage) in another. This theory suggests that a general glut can never be accompanied by inadequate demand for products on a macroeconomic level. In challenging Say&#x27;s law, Thomas Malthus, Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi and other 19th century economists argued that &quot;effective demand&quot; is the foundation of a stable economy. Responding to the Great Depression of the 20th century, in the 1930s Michał Kalecki and John Maynard Keynes concurred with the latter theory, suggesting that &quot;demand creates its own supply&quot; and developing a comprehensive theory of effective demand.

According to Keynesian economics, weak demand results in unplanned accumulation of inventories, leading to diminished production and income, and increased unemployment. This triggers a multiplier effect which draws the economy toward underemployment equilibrium. By the same token, strong demand results in unplanned reduction of inventories, which tends to increase production, employment, and incomes. If entrepreneurs consider such trends sustainable, investments typically increase, thereby improving potential levels of production.

In the 1960s, Robert Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud did further work on effective demand, and in the 1970s Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman published a well-known model of spillover effects upon effective demand.

<text>The peerage title Earl of Ormond and the related titles Duke of Ormonde and Marquess of Ormonde have a long and complex history. An earldom of Ormond has been created three times in the Peerage of Ireland.

==History of Ormonde titles==
The earldom of Ormond was originally created in 1328 for James Butler. For many subsequent years, the earls took significant roles in the government of Ireland, and kept a tradition of loyalty to the English crown and to English custom. Several of the earls also had reputations as scholars. The fifth earl was created Earl of Wiltshire (1449) in the Peerage of England, but he was attainted in 1461 and his peerages were declared forfeit. The earldom of Ormond was restored to his younger brother, John Butler, the sixth earl, in 1476. Thomas, the 7th earl, died without issue in 1515; the &quot;de facto&quot;, if not indeed the &quot;de jure&quot; earl, Piers Butler, a cousin of the 7th Earl, was induced to resign his rights to the title in 1528. This facilitated the next creation by awarding the titles of Ormond and Wiltshire to Thomas Boleyn, who was the father of Anne Boleyn. At that time, Anne was the mistress of King Henry VIII of England. As a maternal grandson of the 7th Earl, Thomas Boleyn had a slim claim to the title. Through his daughter, Anne, he was the grandfather of Elizabeth I of England. On the death of Boleyn, these peerages of the second creation became extinct because he lacked male heirs, his son George having been executed for treason.

As a reward for his patriotism and generosity, Piers Butler was created Earl of Ossory five days after resigning his rights to the other titles. The third creation for Piers Butler (in 1538) merely recognised the reality of the situation prior to the Boleyn irruption, and in 1544 an act of parliament confirmed him in the possession of his earldom, which was declared to be the creation of 1328, and not the new creation of 1538. James Butler, the fifth earl of this creation, was made &quot;Marquess of Ormonde&quot; (1642) and &quot;Duke of Ormonde&quot; (1660) in the Peerage of Ireland, and &quot;Duke of Ormonde&quot; (1682) in the Peerage of England. Through his marriage with his cousin Elizabeth Preston, granddaughter of the third earl, he had reunited the titles with the Ormonde estates. After 1682, the spelling &quot;Ormonde&quot; was used almost universally.

==Other titles held by the earls==
Prior to the creation of the Earldom of Ormond, the First Earl&#x27;s father had been created the first Earl of Carrick. However, this title did not pass to James Butler. After a gap of 7 years following his father&#x27;s death, James, who had recently married Eleanor de Bohun (a granddaughter of Edward I) was rewarded with an earldom in his own right – Ormond.

The 2nd Earl of Ormand was known widely as the &quot;Earl of Gowran&quot; (1385), a customary title. A later peerage title, the Earldom of Gowran, was granted to the seventh son of the 1st Duke of Ormond in 1676 but became extinct within less than two years. A subsidiary barony title - &quot;Baron Gowran&quot; - was held by the FitzPatricks, Earls of Upper Ossory, between 1715-1818.

Subsidiary titles for the dukes were &quot;Earl of Brecknock&quot; (1660) and &quot;Baron Butler&quot; (1660) in the Peerage of England and &quot;Earl of Ormond&quot; (1328), &quot;Earl of Ossory&quot; (1538) and &quot;Viscount Thurles&quot; (1536) in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1715, the second duke was attainted and his English peerages declared forfeit. In 1758 the de jure third duke (Irish) died and the dukedom and marquessate became extinct. Walter, the eleventh earl, was given an English peerage as &quot;Lord Butler of Llanthony&quot; in 1801, and was created the &quot;Marquess of Ormonde&quot; in the Peerage of Ireland in 1816; on his death that title became extinct and the earldoms passed to his brother, for whom the title Marquess of Ormonde was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1825. That title became extinct in 1997, while the earldom became dormant.

An unrelated Earldom of Ormonde was twice created in the Peerage of Scotland.

The 3rd Marquess of Ormonde is recorded as having written to the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Benjamin Disraeli, regarding the restoration of the Dukedom of Ormonde in October 1868. Lord Ormonde claimed that his grandfather, James Butler, 1st Marquess of Ormonde (then 19th Earl of Ormond) had been advised by Lord Liverpool to apply for the restoration of the Dukedom, and that Lord Liverpool had advised him that in order to achieve this, he would first need to apply to be elevated from the rank of Earl to Marquess. An application was duly made, and James, 19th Earl of Ormond was granted the title Marquess of Ormonde. The 3rd Marquess believed that Lord Liverpool&#x27;s loss of the Office of Prime Minister in 1827 frustrated this plan, and the 1st Marquess took no further action towards applying for the restoration of the Dukedom. The 3rd Marquess also alleged in his letter to Prime Minister Disraeli that his father, John Butler, 2nd Marquess of Ormonde had resolved not to pursue the restoration of the Dukedom of Ormonde unless another peer was also elevated to a Dukedom during his lifetime. Disraeli responded to the 3rd Marquess&#x27; letter on 27 October 1868, and expressed his sympathy with Lord Ormonde&#x27;s desire to restore &quot;the title of an illustrious ancestor&quot;. However, in his letter, Disraeli implied that the political climate of the time did not render the creation, or restoration, of the Dukedom of Ormonde to be appropriate, noting that &quot;the condition of the party [the Conservative Party] is now critical&quot;.

==Earls of Ormonde and Ossory (1328/1538; Reverted)==
The presumed successors of the 7th marquess in the Earldoms of Ormonde and Ossory have been the 17th and 18th Viscounts Mountgarret, descending in the male line from a younger son of the 8th Earl; however, no claim from the 17th or 18th viscount was submitted to the Monarch.

<text>Candlebox is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington. Since its formation in 1990, the group has released eight studio albums, several charting singles, a compilation, and a CD+DVD.

Candlebox found immediate success with the release of its self-titled debut album in July 1993. &quot;Candlebox&quot; featured four singles: &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Far Behind&quot; and &quot;Cover Me&quot;. &quot;Far Behind&quot; reached the top 20, and the album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Lucy&quot; (1995), was certified gold, and was followed three years later by &quot;Happy Pills&quot; (1998). After troubles with its record company, Candlebox broke up in 2000. The band reunited in 2006 and they have since released five more studio albums: &quot;Into the Sun&quot; (2008), &quot;Love Stories &amp; Other Musings&quot; (2012) &quot;Disappearing in Airports&quot; (2016), &quot;Wolves&quot; (2021), and their final album &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; released on August 25, 2023.

==History==
===Early career (1990–1992)===
Formed in November 1990, Candlebox originally consisted of lead singer Kevin Martin, guitarist Peter Klett, bassist Bardi Martin, and drummer Scott Mercado.

===Rise to fame (1993–2000)===
Candlebox began performing live in 1991. By 1992 the band was playing regularly in some of Seattle&#x27;s top clubs (including RKCNDY and Farside) to ever increasing audiences.

The band&#x27;s eight-song EP gained the attention of Maverick Records, with whom the band signed. Candlebox was the first successful act on Maverick Records, which went on to sign Alanis Morissette, Deftones and The Prodigy.

On July 20, 1993, Candlebox released its self-titled debut album. It sold more than four million copies and peaked at No. 7 on Billboard&#x27;s album charts. &quot;Candlebox&quot; featured the hit singles &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Far Behind&quot;, and &quot;Cover Me&quot;. &quot;Far Behind&quot; entered &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s top 20 in July 1993, peaked at No. 18, and stayed on the charts until January 1994. The tremendous radio, concert, and television success gained Candlebox an opening slot for Rush on their &quot;Counterparts&quot; tour and Metallica on their Shit Hits the Sheds Tour, as well as a main-stage slot at Woodstock &#x27;94. They also played with bands like Living Colour, The Offspring, Aerosmith, Radiohead and The Flaming Lips, and by the end of 1994, the band had graduated to headlining their own tours. In addition, Candlebox won &quot;Metal Edge&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1994 Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Best New Band.

Hot off the success of &quot;Candlebox&quot;, the band was eager to progress and by April 1994 had 36 new songs for a follow-up record. On October 3, 1995, Candlebox released its second album, &quot;Lucy&quot;. Although it marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s decline in popularity, &quot;Lucy&quot; was certified gold thanks to singles such as &quot;Simple Lessons&quot; and &quot;Understanding&quot;. Two days after the release of &quot;Lucy&quot;, Candlebox appeared on &quot;Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon&quot; with its cover of &quot;Steel and Glass&quot;. After spending the remainder of 1995 and most of 1996 touring behind &quot;Lucy&quot; (including playing with bands like Our Lady Peace, Sponge, Seaweed, Foo Fighters, Everclear and Stabbing Westward), Scott Mercado left the band in 1997 and was replaced by original Pearl Jam drummer Dave Krusen.

On July 21, 1998, Candlebox released its third studio album, &quot;Happy Pills&quot;. While a return to the simpler sound of its debut, it gained only marginal success. The song &quot;Glowing Soul&quot; was also recorded for the soundtrack to &quot;The Waterboy&quot; and included at the request of Adam Sandler. Inspired by the film, the song was based on a Bo Diddley rhythm and recorded with vintage equipment.

Krusen departed from Candlebox in 1999 and was replaced by Shannon Larkin of Ugly Kid Joe. Bardi Martin left to attend college and was replaced by Rob Redick, formerly of Dig. By 2000, Candlebox disbanded. According to Martin, the band was unhappy with its record contract and attempted to be freed from Maverick after two years by breaking up. The former Candlebox members would pursue other musical endeavors during the 2000s.

===Reunion and continued work (2006–2022)===

In 2006, Rhino Records planned to release a &quot;Best of&quot; compilation of Candlebox, which prompted the original band lineup to reunite for the first time in nearly 10 years (with Sean Hennesy on rhythm guitar). To promote the compilation, Candlebox embarked on a three-month North American tour from July to October of that year. Bardi Martin left the band in 2007 to continue his education to become a lawyer, with Adam Kury as his replacement. During the time, the band would begin writing new material despite having no record label.

After several delays, Candlebox released its first album in 10 years, &quot;Into the Sun,&quot; on July 22 via Silent Majority/ILG records. The album was produced by Ron Aniello (Lifehouse, Barenaked Ladies) and features performances by both Scott Mercado and Dave Krusen on drums. The first single, &quot;Stand&quot;, was released to radio in mid-May and Candlebox officially commenced touring in support of the new record in June 2008. &quot;Stand&quot; reached as high as No. 15 on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart.

On July 4, 2008 Candlebox performed at the O&#x27;Fallon, Missouri Heritage and Freedom Fest in front of a record crowd. Two months later, the band released a live CD/DVD called &quot;Alive in Seattle&quot;.

On August 9, 2010, Candlebox kicked off a five-show stint overseas performing for U.S. troops at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait and continued on to Iraq.

In 2010, Peter Klett and Scott Mercado formed Lotus Crush, consisting of: Terry McDermott (lead vocals), Peter Klett (lead guitar), Johnny Bacolas (bass), Scott Mercado (drums), and John Luzzi (rhythm guitar).

On April 3, 2012 Candlebox released its fifth studio album, &quot;Love Stories &amp; Other Musings&quot; produced by Ken Andrews (Failure/Thousand Foot Krutch/Lostprophets).

Although the band had planned to put out a new album in 2015, those plans were postponed after Candlebox parted ways with its record label at the time. In 2015, founding members Scott Mercado and Peter Klett announced that they were leaving the band to focus on Lotus Crush; the split was amicable. Sean Hennesy left the band shortly thereafter. Former drummer Dave Krusen rejoined the band, and new members Mike Leslie (lead guitar) and Brian Quinn (rhythm guitar) also joined.

It was announced in August 2015 that Candlebox had inked a record deal through Pavement Music and that the band was working on a new record for an early 2016 release. The album, titled &quot;Disappearing in Airports&quot;, was released on April 22, 2016.

Island Styles and former Daughtry drummer Robin Diaz joined Candlebox in late 2016 for its second live album, &quot;Disappearing Live&quot;.

In July 2018, the original Candlebox lineup had a one-off reunion for the two live shows in Seattle, performing the band&#x27;s debut album in its entirety to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its release.

Candlebox&#x27;s first studio album in five years, &quot;Wolves&quot;, was released on September 17, 2021. The album was preceded six months earlier by its lead single &quot;My Weakness&quot;.

===The Long Goodbye Tour &amp; album, tour with Bush (2023–2024)===
On June 8, 2023, the band announced on an Instagram livestream their final album entitled &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; would be released in August 2023 and will be supported by the band’s (at the time) final tour, The Long Goodbye Tour.

On October 11, 2023, Candlebox frontman Kevin Martin announced via the band&#x27;s YouTube channel that the band will extend The Long Goodbye Tour into 2024, performing in its first ever Australian Tour.

Candlebox announced on January 16, 2024 that they would be opening for Bush’s summer 2024 Loaded: The Greatest Hits tour along with Jerry Cantrell.

On February 12, 2023, the group announced via social media that original guitarist Peter Klett was rejoining after a 9 year absence. They revealed that guitarist Brian Quinn would be leaving as a result, but called him a &quot;crucial part&quot; of the band&#x27;s activities in the past decade. &quot;We can’t wait to see what the future holds with Peter back in the fold,&quot; they wrote. &quot;Stay tuned for what’s to come – this is just the beginning!&quot;

==Musical style==
Candlebox&#x27;s musical style, while predominantly hard rock, has a wide range of influences. Some of the band&#x27;s songs have strong references to blues, grunge, rock and glam metal. Despite various aforementioned classic roots, the band&#x27;s music is considered contemporary.

<doc id="570950" wikidata="Q5326350" url="?curid=570950" title="Earl of Ossory">
<text>Earl of Ossory is a subsidiary title held by the Earl of Ormond that was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1528.

During King Henry VIII of England&#x27;s pursuit of Anne Boleyn, who would be his second wife, he arranged for the main claimant to the earldom of Ormond, Piers Butler, to renounce all his claims to the titles in favour of Anne&#x27;s father, Thomas Boleyn. Butler was rewarded for his compliance by being created Earl of Ossory on 22 February 1528.
In 1662, the eldest son of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde was called to the Irish House of Lords on a writ of acceleration and became known as Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory. His father held the title &quot;5th Earl of Ossory&quot; as one of his subsidiary titles, which made Thomas Butler the 6th Earl by courtesy. He predeceased his father and thus never became Earl of Ormonde in his own right.

<doc id="570961" wikidata="Q4790772" url="?curid=570961" title="Tonewheel">
<text>A tonewheel or tone wheel is a simple electromechanical apparatus used for generating electric musical notes in electromechanical organ instruments such as the Hammond organ and in telephony to generate audible signals such as ringing tone. It was developed by Thaddeus Cahill for the telharmonium c. 1896 and patented in 1897. It was reinvented around 1910 by Rudolph Goldschmidt for use in pre–vacuum-tube radio receivers as a beat frequency oscillator (BFO) to make continuous wave radiotelegraphy (Morse code) signals audible.

==Description==
The tonewheel assembly consists of a synchronous AC motor and an associated gearbox that drives a series of rotating disks. Each disk has a given number of smooth bumps at the rim; these generate a specific frequency as the disk rotates close to a pickup assembly that consists of a magnet and electromagnetic coil.

As each bump in the wheel approaches the pickup, it temporarily concentrates the magnetic field near it, and thus strengthens the magnetic field that passes through the coil, inducing a current in the coil by the process of electromagnetic induction. As the bump moves past, this concentrating effect is reduced again, the magnetic field weakens slightly, and an opposite current is induced in the coil. Thus, the frequency of the current in the coil depends on the speed of rotation of the disk and the number of bumps.
Typically, the coil is connected to an amplifier through a network of switches, contacts, resistor banks, and transformers which can be used to mix the fluctuating current representing the note from one coil with similar currents from other coils representing other notes. A single fundamental frequency can thus be combined with one or more harmonics to produce complex sounds. Tonewheels were first developed for and used in the impractical Telharmonium circa 1896 and later in the original Hammond organs.

&quot;Tonewheel leakage&quot; occurs in the Hammond organ and in similar situations, where the large number of tonewheels causes pickups to overhear tonewheels other than their own. This causes the organ to add chromatics to played notes. In some kinds of music this is undesirable, but in others it has become an important part of the Hammond sound. On some digital simulations of Hammond organs tonewheel leakage is a user-set parameter.

== Early uses ==
The tonewheel was independently invented in 1910 by Rudolph Goldschmidt as a beat frequency oscillator in early radio receivers to make continuous wave radiotelegraphy (Morse code) signals audible, before the existence of the vacuum tube.

<doc id="570963" wikidata="Q1661238" url="?curid=570963" title="Marginal propensity to save">
<text>The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of an increase in income that is not spent and instead used for saving. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal propensity to save is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income.

The MPS plays a central role in Keynesian economics as it quantifies the saving-income relation, which is the flip side of the consumption-income relation, and according to Keynes it reflects the fundamental psychological law. The marginal propensity to save is also a key variable in determining the value of the multiplier.

==Calculation==

Marginal propensity to save (MPS) can be calculated as the change in savings (S) divided by the change in disposable income (Y).

:formula_1   formula_2

===Notes===
#MPS is the opposite of marginal propensity to consume (MPC); 
#MPS oscillates between 0 and 1;
#MPS can never be negative.

==Multiplier effect==

===Mathematical implication===
The end result is a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by the change in investment, but amplified by the change in consumption i.e. the initial investment multiplied by the consumption coefficient (Marginal Propensity to consume).

The MPS enters into the process because it indicates the division of extra income between consumption and saving. It determines how much saving is induced with each change in production and income, and thus how much consumption is induced. If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, but more consumption is induced, with each round of activity.

Thus, in this highly simplified model, total magnified change in production due to change in an autonomous variable by $1
 = formula_3

<doc id="570969" wikidata="Q905296" url="?curid=570969" title="Different Stages (Rush album)">
<text>Different Stages is a live album by Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1998. The bulk of the first and second discs were recorded at the World Music Theatre in Tinley Park, Illinois, during the 1997 &quot;Test for Echo&quot; tour. Five other songs from various stops along the tour were included and three songs from the 1994 &quot;Counterparts&quot; tour. The third disc is taken from a performance at the Hammersmith Odeon in London during the &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; tour in 1978.

The album was compiled and released by lead singer and bassist Geddy Lee and producer Paul Northfield in the wake of the deaths of drummer Neil Peart&#x27;s daughter and first wife in 1997 and 1998, respectively. Production of the album occurred during Peart&#x27;s recovery from his loss as chronicled in his book &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;, and he was consequently not involved in the production of the album. At the time, Peart had declared to his bandmates that they should &quot;consider [him] retired&quot;, leaving guitarist Alex Lifeson and Lee facing the possibility of the album being Rush&#x27;s last. 

The album is dedicated to the memory of Peart&#x27;s daughter Selena, who died in a car accident in 1997, and his wife Jacqueline, who died of cancer 10 months later. The text &quot;Suddenly ... You were gone ... from all the lives you left your mark upon. In loving memory of Jackie and Selena&quot;, is included in the album&#x27;s packaging. The lyrics featured are from the song &quot;Afterimage&quot;, from Rush&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;.

The Japanese release of &quot;Different Stages&quot; includes &quot;Force Ten&quot; as a bonus track, and the lyrics for all songs on the album. The initial first pressings contained miniature replica tour booklets from the &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; and &quot;Test for Echo&quot; tours.

The concert featured on the third disc was released in 2017 in its complete form on the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;.

<doc id="570980" wikidata="Q7753504" url="?curid=570980" title="The New Americans">
<text>The New Americans is a seven-hour American documentary, produced by Kartemquin Films, which was originally broadcast on American television over three nights on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in late March 2004.

==Description==
The observational documentary, which includes minimal voice-over narration and very little direct interviewing of its subjects (and none in which the interviewer&#x27;s voice is heard), follows the lives of a series of immigrants to the United States over the course of four years. The series was filmed between 1998 and 2001, although not all of its subjects were filmed during that entire length of time. The immigrants were filmed both in their countries of origin before immigrating as well as in the United States. The filming during this period was extensive and occurred in the subjects&#x27; homes, at their places of work, in government offices, and in a number of other situations, many of them quite intimate. As a result, &quot;The New Americans&quot; offers an unusually personal and comprehensive look at the people it profiles.

==Topics==
The immigrants profiled and filmed in &quot;The New Americans&quot; include many immigrants from diverse backgrounds:
*a group of baseball players from the Dominican Republic hoping to secure a career in Major League Baseball
*a computer programmer from India and his wife
*a family with six children from a farming community in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico
*a family of Ogoni refugees from Nigeria
*a woman from Palestine who moves to the United States to be with her new husband, a first-generation Palestinian-American who grew up in Chicago

The locations shown in the documentary include not only each of the immigrants&#x27; countries of origin, but also many places in the United States where the immigrants settled or traveled, including the locations of:
*Chicago (Palestinian and Nigerian immigrants)
*Silicon Valley, California (Indian immigrants)
*Garden City, Kansas and Mecca, California (Mexican immigrants)
*Florida, Georgia, and Montana (Dominican immigrants).

==Production==
&quot;The New Americans&quot; was executive produced by Steve James (who also produced the acclaimed 1994 documentary &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;) and Gordon Quinn, both of Kartemquin Films. It was broadcast on PBS as part of the series &quot;Independent Lens&quot;, in association with the Independent Television Service (ITVS). The program was also broadcast in the United Kingdom on the cable network BBC Four in early April 2004.

Steve James commented on the making of the New Americans, “From the beginning, we knew we wanted to tell multiple stories, because every immigrant I’ve met has a very rich and varied story to tell about where they come from. We also were excited about the idea of telling these people’s stories before they left their countries so that we could begin to understand these people in their own country before they gave it all up to come here. They’re all facing different problems different dreams, so there’s that diversity too. They’re a nice collection of stories because their differences and similarities.”

==Funding==
Primary funding was provided by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). Additional major funding was provided by The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Annie E. Casey Foundation and PBS. Additional funding also came from the National Endowment of the Arts, BBC, Nick Fraser, SBS, TV Australia, and VPRO, The Netherlands. The New Americans is a presentation of ITVS in association with Latino Public Broadcasting (LPB) and Asian Women United/National Asian American Telecommunications Association (NAATA).

==Awards==
The New Americans won a variety of awards including: The Chicago Award for Best Chicago or Illinois Production, Chicago International Television Competition (2004); Gold Hugo for Best Overall Production, Chicago International Television Competition 2004]; Best Limited Series, Distinguished Documentary Achievement Awards, International Documentary Association (IDA) (2004); and the Christopher Award, TV/Cable Category, (2005).

<doc id="570981" wikidata="Q361267" url="?curid=570981" title="John Robson (politician)">
<text>John Robson (14 March 1824 – 29 June 1892) was a Canadian journalist and politician, who served as the ninth premier of British Columbia.

==Journalist and activist==
Robson spent his early life as a merchant in Canada West and Montreal in Canada East. In 1859, upon news of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, Robson moved west to the then Colony of British Columbia from Upper Canada. Unsuccessful at prospecting, Robson helped his brother, a Methodist minister, complete construction of a church in New Westminster, the capital of the new colony. He settled there and evidently became known in reformist circles as an articulate advocate of responsible government, for he was shortly hired as editor of a new newspaper, &quot;The British Columbian&quot;. His advocacy of devolution of power from the colonial governor, Sir James Douglas, to a democratically elected assembly brought him into conflict with the august and autocratic Douglas. Douglas governed both British Columbia and the Colony of Vancouver Island from Victoria, and this absence incurred further complaint from Robson and his paper.

Robson joined forces with other colonial-era editors such as Amor De Cosmos in railing against the Governor and his officials, including Chief Justice Sir Matthew Baillie Begbie. In 1862, Begbie cited contempt of court charges against Robson during the Cottonwood Scandal for publishing an unproven allegation that the Chief Justice had accepted a bribe from land speculators. Robson served on the New Westminster town council in the 1860s before being appointed to the British Columbia legislative council.

By 1864, Douglas had retired and the colony finally had its own resident governor, Frederick Seymour. By now, Robson had toned down his rhetoric about responsible government as the colonial assembly began to accrue more power. He was a reluctant supporter of the colony&#x27;s union with Vancouver Island in 1866, but by 1869, Robson had moved his newspaper&#x27;s operations across the Strait to Victoria. It was soon bought out by the rival &quot;Daily British Colonist&quot; (today the &quot;Victoria Times-Colonist&quot;), which had been founded by De Cosmos. There Robson served as political editor for six years, and became a passionate advocate for the colony&#x27;s union with Canada, formed as a confederation of four colonies of British North America on 1 July 1867. Together with De Cosmos and Robert Beaven (also future premiers), Robson founded the Confederation League which lobbied Seymour, as well as London and Ottawa, for British Columbia&#x27;s entry into Confederation.

Robson&#x27;s advocacy eventually paid off when British Columbia was admitted as the sixth province on 20 July 1871.

==Provincial political career==
During British Columbia&#x27;s colonial days, Robson had briefly served in the colonial assembly, but otherwise his political activity was limited to editorializing and lobbying. Once the colony joined confederation in 1871, however, he ran and was elected to the new province&#x27;s first legislative assembly as a representative for Nanaimo. There he became an opponent of his former ally De Cosmos as well as Premier George Anthony Walkem, and advocated reforms, including female suffrage. His support for Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s Liberals in the 1874 federal election, won him a patronage appointment with the Canadian Pacific Railway, a position he held for five years. Following this, Robson purchased a newspaper in New Westminster, which he published and edited for two years.

In 1882, after a seven-year absence, Robson returned to the provincial legislature as one of the members for New Westminster. He served in various high-profile cabinet portfolios under Premiers William Smithe and A.E.B. Davie, where he earned a reputation as an advocate for public education, accelerated settlement, improved exploration and surveys, and subsidies to transportation providers, such as railways. He was also a vigorous opponent of land speculation, seeing it as a hindrance to settlement and transforming land into economically viable resources. Perhaps his greatest success came as the leading advocate for constructing the Canadian Pacific Railway terminus at Granville, and his encouragement of the citizens there to incorporate their locality. It was Robson who was responsible for having the legislature name the new municipality Vancouver upon its incorporation in 1886. During Davie&#x27;s illness, Robson served as acting premier.

Upon Davie&#x27;s death 1889, Robson was appointed premier. In 1890, to ease his workload, he moved from representing the busy, growing riding of New Westminster to becoming one of the members for the vast, frontier electoral district of Cariboo in the province&#x27;s Central Interior. His brief tenure is chiefly remembered for his continued actions to enable &quot;Dominion Lands Act&quot; homesteading, as well as his lobbying of the federal government to construct a dry dock at Esquimalt, just west of Victoria. Robson remained premier until his death in 1892, which occurred after he hurt his finger in the door of a carriage during a visit to London, and got blood poisoning.

John Robson is interred in the Ross Bay Cemetery in Victoria, British Columbia.

<text>Mont Tremblant () is a mountain of the Laurentian Mountains, reaching an altitude of 932 metres. It is located in the province of Quebec, Canada, in Mont-Tremblant National Park, about 15 km northeast of the town of Mont-Tremblant and east of Lake Tremblant in the Laurentides region north of Montreal. It is one of the tallest peaks of the Laurentian range. It hosts the Mont Tremblant Resort.

The Algonquin people called the mountain &quot;Manitonga Soutana&quot; (&quot;Mountain of Spirits&quot;), and described the mountain as emitting rumblings and swaying under their feet. This gave rise to the French name &quot;montagne Tremblante&quot; or &quot;mont Tremblant&quot;, literally &quot;trembling mountain.&quot; 

The first resort was founded on the mountain slopes in 1939.

<text>Consumption refers to the use of resources to fulfill present needs and desires. It is seen in contrast to investing, which is spending for acquisition of &quot;future&quot; income. Consumption is a major concept in economics and is also studied in many other social sciences.

Different schools of economists define consumption differently. According to mainstream economists, only the final purchase of newly produced goods and services by individuals for immediate use constitutes consumption, while other types of expenditure — in particular, fixed investment, intermediate consumption, and government spending — are placed in separate categories (see consumer choice). Other economists define consumption much more broadly, as the aggregate of all economic activity that does not entail the design, production and marketing of goods and services (e.g., the selection, adoption, use, disposal and recycling of goods and services).

Economists are particularly interested in the relationship between consumption and income, as modelled with the consumption function. A similar realist structural view can be found in consumption theory, which views the Fisherian intertemporal choice framework as the real structure of the consumption function. Unlike the passive strategy of structure embodied in inductive structural realism, economists define structure in terms of its invariance under intervention.

==Behavioural economics, Keynesian consumption function ==

The Keynesian consumption function is also known as the absolute income hypothesis, as it only bases consumption on current income and ignores potential future income (or lack of). Criticism of this assumption led to the development of Milton Friedman&#x27;s permanent income hypothesis and Franco Modigliani&#x27;s life cycle hypothesis.

More recent theoretical approaches are based on behavioural economics and suggest that a number of behavioural principles can be taken as microeconomic foundations for a behaviourally-based aggregate consumption function.

Behavioural economics also adopts and explains several human behavioural traits within the constraint of the standard economic model. These include bounded rationality, bounded willpower, and bounded selfishness.

Bounded rationality was first proposed by Herbert Simon. This means that people sometimes respond rationally to their own cognitive limits, which aimed to minimize the sum of the costs of decision making and the costs of error. In addition, bounded willpower refers to the fact that people often take actions that they know are in conflict with their long-term interests. For example, most smokers would rather not smoke, and many smokers willing to pay for a drug or a program to help them quit. Finally, bounded self-interest refers to an essential fact about the utility function of a large part of people: under certain circumstances, they care about others or act as if they care about others, even strangers.

==Consumption and household production==
Aggregate consumption is a component of aggregate demand.

Consumption is defined in part by comparison to production.
In the tradition of the Columbia School of Household Economics, also known as the New Home Economics, commercial consumption has to be analyzed in the context of household production. The opportunity cost of time affects the cost of home-produced substitutes and therefore demand for commercial goods and services. The elasticity of demand for consumption goods is also a function of who performs chores in households and how their spouses compensate them for opportunity costs of home production.

Different schools of economists define production and consumption differently. According to mainstream economists, only the final purchase of goods and services by individuals constitutes consumption, while other types of expenditure — in particular, fixed investment, intermediate consumption, and government spending — are placed in separate categories (See consumer choice). Other economists define consumption much more broadly, as the aggregate of all economic activity that does not entail the design, production and marketing of goods and services (e.g., the selection, adoption, use, disposal and recycling of goods and services).

Consumption can also be measured in a variety of different ways such as energy in energy economics metrics.

== Consumption as part of GDP ==
GDP (Gross domestic product) is defined via this formula:

formula_1

Where formula_2 stands for consumption.

Where formula_3 stands for total government spending. (including salaries)

Where formula_4 stands for Investments.

Where formula_5 stands for net exports. Net exports are exports minus imports.

In most countries consumption is the most important part of GDP. It usually ranges from 45% from GDP to 85% of GDP.

== Consumption in microeconomics ==
In microeconomics, consumer choice is a theory that assumes that people are rational consumers and they decide on what combinations of goods to buy based on their utility function (which goods provide them with more use/happiness) and their budget constraint (which combinations of goods they can afford to buy). Consumers try to maximize utility while staying within the limits of their budget constrain or to minimize cost while getting the target level of utility. A special case of this is the consumption-leisure model where a consumer chooses between a combination of leisure and working time, which is represented by income.

However, behavioural economics shows that consumers do not behave rationally and they are influenced by factors other than their utility from the given good. Those factors can be the popularity of a given good or its position in a supermarket.

== Consumption in macroeconomics ==
In macroeconomics in the theory of national accounts consumption is not only the amount of money that is spent by households on goods and services from companies, but also the expenditures of government that are meant to provide things for citizens they would have to buy themselves otherwise. This means things like healthcare. Where consumption is equal to income minus savings. Consumption can be calculated via this formula:

formula_6

Where formula_7 stands for autonomous consumption which is minimal consumption of household that is achieved always, by either reducing the savings of household or by borrowing money.

formula_8 is marginal propensity to consume where formula_9 and it reveals how much of household income is spent on consumption.

formula_10 is the disposable income of the household.

== Consumption as a measurement of growth ==
Consumption of electric energy is positively correlated with economical growth. As electric energy is one of the most important inputs of the economy. Electric energy is needed to produce goods and to provide services to consumers. There is a statistically significant effect of electrical energy consumption and economic growth that is positive. Electricity consumption reflects economic growth. With the gradual rise of people&#x27;s material level, electric energy consumption is also gradually increasing. In Iran, for example, electricity consumption has increased along with economic growth since 1970. But as countries continue to develop this effect is decreasing as they optimize their production, by getting more energy-efficient equipment. Or by transferring parts of their production to foreign nations where the cost of electrical energy is smaller.
== Determinant factors of consumption ==

The main factors affecting consumption studied by economists include:

Income: Economists consider the income level to be the most crucial factor affecting consumption. Therefore, the offered consumption functions often emphasize this variable. Keynes considers absolute income, Duesenberry considers relative income, and Friedman considers permanent income as factors that determine one&#x27;s consumption.

Consumer expectations: Changes in the prices would change the real income and purchasing power of the consumer. If the consumer&#x27;s expectations about future prices change, it can change his consumption decisions in the present period.

Consumer assets and wealth: These refer to assets in the form of cash, bank deposits, securities, as well as physical assets such as stocks of durable goods or real estate such as houses, land, etc. These factors can affect consumption; if the mentioned assets are sufficiently liquid, they will remain in reserve and can be used in emergencies.

Consumer credits: The increase in the consumer&#x27;s credit and his credit transactions can allow the consumer to use his future income at present. As a result, it can lead to more consumption expenditure compared to the case that the only purchasing power is current income.

Interest rate: Fluctuations in interest rates can affect household consumption decisions. An increase in interest rates increases people&#x27;s savings and, as a result, reduces their consumption expenditures.

Household size: Households&#x27; absolute consumption costs increase as the number of family members increases. Although for some goods, as the number of households increases, the consumption of such goods would increase relatively less than the number of households. This happens due to the phenomena of the economy of scale.

Social groups: Household consumption varies in different social groups. For example, the consumption pattern of employers is different from the consumption pattern of workers. The smaller the gap between groups in a society, the more homogeneous consumption pattern within the society.

Consumer taste: One of the important factors in shaping the consumption pattern is consumer taste. This factor, to some extent, can affect other factors such as income and price levels. On the other hand, society&#x27;s culture has a significant impact on shaping the tastes of consumers.

Area: Consumption patterns are different in different geographical regions. For example, this pattern differs from urban and rural areas, crowded and sparsely populated areas, economically active and inactive areas, etc.

== Consumption theories ==

Consumption theories began with John Maynard Keynes in 1936 and were developed by economists such as Friedman, Dusenbery, and Modigliani. The relationship between consumption and income was a crucial concept in macroeconomic analysis for a long time.

=== Absolute Income Hypothesis ===

In his 1936 General Theory, Keynes introduced the consumption function. He believed that various factors influence consumption decisions; But in the short run, the most important factor is real income. According to the Absolute Income Hypothesis, consumer spending on consumption goods and services is a linear function of his current disposable income.

=== Relative Income Hypothesis ===
James Duesenberry proposed this model in 1949. This theory is based on two assumptions:
#People&#x27;s consumption behavior is not independent of each other. In other words, two people with the same income that live in two different positions within the income distribution will have different consumptions. In fact, one compares oneself with other people, and what has a significant impact on one&#x27;s consumption is one&#x27;s position among individuals and groups in society; Therefore, a person only feels an improvement in his situation in terms of consumption if his average consumption increases relative to the average level of society. This phenomenon is called the Demonstration Effect.
#Consumer behavior over time is irreversible. This means that when income declines, consumer spending is sticky to the former level. After getting used to a level of consumption, a person shows resistance to reducing it and is unwilling to reduce that level of consumption. This phenomenon is called the ratchet effect.

=== Intertemporal consumption ===
The model of intertemporal consumption was first thought of by John Rae in 1830s and it was later expanded by Irving Fisher in 1930s in the book &quot;Theory of interest&quot;. This model describes how consumption is distributed over periods of life. In the basic model with 2 periods for example young and old age.

formula_11

And then

formula_12

Where formula_2 is the consumption in a given year.

Where formula_14 is the income received in a given year.

Where formula_15 are saving from a given year.

Where formula_16 is the interest rate.

Indexes 1,2 stand for period 1 and period 2.

This model can be expanded to represent each year of a lifetime.

=== Permanent income hypothesis ===
The permanent income hypothesis was developed by Milton Friedman in the 1950s in his book &quot;A theory of the Consumption Function&quot;. This theory divides income into two components: formula_17 is transitory income and formula_18 is permanent income, such that formula_19.

Changes in the two components have different impacts on consumption. If formula_18 changes then consumption changes accordingly by formula_21, where formula_22 is known as the &quot;marginal propensity to consume&quot;. If we expect part of income to be saved or invested, then formula_23, otherwise formula_24. On the other hand, if formula_17 changes (for example as a result of winning the lottery), then this increase in income is distributed over the remaining lifespan. For example, winning $1000 with the expectation of living for 10 more years will result in yearly increase of consumption by $100.

=== Life-cycle hypothesis ===
The life-cycle hypothesis was published by Franco Modigliani in 1966. It describes how people make consumption decisions based on their past income, current income, and future income as they tend to distribute their consumption over their lifetime. It is, in its basic form:

formula_26

Where formula_2 is the consumption in given year.

Where formula_28 is the number of years the individual is going to live for.

Where formula_29 is for how many more years will the individual be working.

Where formula_14 is the average wage the individual will be paid over his or her remaining work time

And formula_31 is the wealth he has already accumulated in his or her life.

===Access-based consumption===
The term &quot;access-based consumption&quot; refers to the increasing extent to which people seek the experience of temporarily accessing goods rather than owning them, thus there are opportunities for a &quot;sharing economy&quot; to develop, although Bardhi and Eckhardt outline differences between &quot;access&quot; and &quot;sharing&quot;. Social theorist Jeremy Rifkin put forward the idea in his 2000 publication &quot;The Age of Access&quot;.

== Old-age spending ==
&quot;Spending the Kids&#x27; Inheritance&quot; (originally the title of a book on the subject by Annie Hulley) and the acronyms SKI and SKI&#x27;ing refer to the growing number of older people in Western society spending their money on travel, cars and property, in contrast to previous generations who tended to leave that money to their children. According to a study from 2017 that was conducted in the USA 20% of married people consider leaving inheritance a priority, while 34% do not consider it as a priority. And about one in ten unmarried Americans (14 percent) plan to spend their retirement money to improve their lives, rather than saving it to leave an inheritance to their children. In addition, three in ten married Americans (28 percent) have downsized or plan to downsize their home after retirement.

&quot;Die Broke&quot; (from the book &quot;Die Broke: A Radical Four-Part Financial Plan&quot; by Stephen Pollan and Mark Levine) is a similar idea.

<doc id="570998" wikidata="Q6221426" url="?curid=570998" title="John Bell (Australian actor)">
<text>John Anthony Bell (born 1 November 1940) is an Australian actor, theatre director and theatre manager. He has been a major influence on the development of Australian theatre in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

==Early life==
Bell was born 1 November 1940 in Newcastle, New South Wales, to a bank manager father and elocutionist mother. As the oldest child, he grew up alongside three younger sisters and a brother. 

At age 9 or 10, he moved with his family to the town of Maitland, New South Wales where he was educated at the Marist Brothers College. At school, he studied Shakespeare, where he developed and performed one-man stage shows. At the age of 15, he developed aspirations to become a Shakespearean actor after seeing Laurence Olivier as Henry V on screen. 

Bell auditioned for National Institute of Dramatic Art&#x27;s (NIDA&#x27;s) first intake in 1958 and was accepted, but his parents and teachers convinced him to go to Sydney University instead, where he studied an arts degree. He graduated with English Honours in 1962.

==Career==
In 1963, the year after his university graduation, Bell joined the Old Tote Theatre Company, where he played the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

Bell relocated to the United Kingdom in 1964, after winning a scholarship from the British Council, and was invited to join the Royal Shakespeare Company. He spent five years with them as an Associate Artist. He returned to Australia in 1969 and taught at National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). 

In 1970, Bell co-founded the Nimrod Theatre Company in Sydney, and was Artistic Director, investing in producing Australian theatre. That same year, he directed the first production of &quot;The Legend of King O&#x27;Malley&quot; (a musical play based on the life of King O&#x27;Malley by Bob Ellis and Michael Boddy), featuring Robyn Nevin and Kate Fitzpatrick. He also directed plays by leading playwrights David Williamson, Ron Blair, Peter Kenna and Louis Nowra, including Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Travelling North&quot;, &quot;The Club&quot; and &quot;The Removalists&quot; and Kenna&#x27;s &quot;A Hard God&quot;. In 1985 he resigned from his role at Nimrod Theatre in order to freelance as a director and actor.

In 1990, he formed the Bell Shakespeare Company, performing and touring his own productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s works. Amongst other plays, he has produced &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;Pericles&quot;, &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, and Goldoni&#x27;s &quot;The Servant of Two Masters&quot;.

His own roles for the company include Shylock, Richard III, Macbeth, Malvolio, Coriolanus, Leontes, Prospero, King Lear and Ulysses. He has also played Hamlet, Henry V, Berowne, Petruchio, Cyrano de Bergerac and Titus Andronicus. His performances in &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; were met with critical acclaim.

In 2009, Bell directed the opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; for Oz Opera, which toured throughout Australia.

In 2011, he published the book &quot;On Shakespeare&quot;, detailing his thoughts and reminiscences of playing Shakespeare for more than 50 years.

In 2015, at the age of 75, Bell retired from running Bell Shakespeare, handing the reins over to his successor, Peter Evans. He has since engaged as a corporate speaker, performed poetry recitals with pianist Simon Tedeschi and taken on further stage roles, including the title role in &quot;The Father&quot; with Sydney Theatre Company. Additionally, in his spare time, he started the Bouddi Foundation, based on the NSW central coast, which assists emerging 

In 2021, Bell delivered the Boyer Lecture on the themes of &quot;Life Lessons from Shakespeare&quot;, &quot;Order vs Chaos&quot;, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Women&quot;, and &quot;Imaginary Forces&quot;. The lectures demonstrate the relevance of Shakespeare&#x27;s works to today&#x27;s issues of need for good governance, the danger of political self interest, and the need for gender inequality.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1978 New Year Honours, Bell was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1987, he was named a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). In the 2009 Australia Day Honours, he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).

In 2001 a painting of Bell by artist Nicholas Harding won the Archibald Prize.

In 2003 the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, presented Bell with the Cultural Leader of the Year Award.

In 2016 he was awarded Australian Humanist of the Year (AHOY).

In 2019 Bell was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of New South Wales.

His achievements in theatre have been acknowledged by the Universities of Newcastle (1994), Sydney (1996) and New South Wales, all of whom have awarded him honorary Doctor of Letters degrees.

==Personal life==

Bell attended the University of Sydney with Clive James and Germaine Greer. He is a contemporary and friend of Bruce Beresford (film director, with whom he shared a house and for whom he did some film acting), Ken Horler, Mungo McCallum, Bob Ellis, Richard Wherrett, John Gaden, Laurie Oakes (journalist), and Les Murray (poet).

His brother is the artist Michael Bell.

Bell met Polish-born Australian actress and NIDA graduate Anna Volska in 1963, when they performed in a production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; together. Volska followed Bell to the UK when he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, and they married in 1965 in Stratford-upon-Avon, where their two daughters were born. 

The couple&#x27;s daughters are playwright Hilary Bell (b. 1966) and &quot;Grass Roots&quot; actress Lucy Bell (b. 1968). Through their daughters, they have five grandchildren, the eldest of whom aspires to be a filmmaker. 

Bell and Volska reside in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra.

<doc id="571001" wikidata="Q1879079" url="?curid=571001" title="Marginal propensity to consume">
<text>In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is a metric that quantifies induced consumption, the concept that the increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) occurs with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which individuals spend on consumption is known as propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of additional income that an individual consumes. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Obviously, the household cannot spend &quot;more&quot; than the extra dollar (without borrowing or using savings). If the extra money accessed by the individual gives more economic confidence, then the MPC of the individual may well exceed 1, as they may borrow or utilise savings. 

According to John Maynard Keynes, marginal propensity to consume is less than one. As such, the MPC is higher in the case of poorer people than in rich.

== Background ==
Mathematically, the formula_1 function is expressed as the derivative of the consumption function formula_2 with respect to disposable income formula_3, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the formula_2-formula_3 curve.

:formula_6

or, approximately,

:formula_7, where formula_8 is the change in consumption, and formula_9 is the change in disposable income that produced the consumption.
Marginal propensity to consume can be found by dividing change in consumption by a change in income, or formula_10. The MPC can be explained with the simple example:
Here formula_11; formula_12
Therefore, formula_13 or 83%.
For example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it&#x27;s $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You suddenly have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on a new business suit, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (formula_14).

The marginal propensity to consume is measured as the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1. The MPC can be more than one if the subject borrowed money or dissaved to finance expenditures higher than their income. The MPC can also be less than zero if an increase in income leads to a reduction in consumption (which might occur if, for example, the increase in income makes it worthwhile to save up for a particular purchase). One minus the MPC equals the marginal propensity to save (in a two sector closed economy), which is crucial to Keynesian economics and a key variable in determining the value of the multiplier. In symbols, we have:formula_15.

In a standard Keynesian model, the MPC is less than the average propensity to consume (APC) because in the short-run some (autonomous) consumption does not change with income. Falls (increases) in income do not lead to reductions (increases) in consumption because people reduce (add to) savings to stabilize consumption. Over the long-run, as wealth and income rise, consumption also rises; the marginal propensity to consume out of long-run income is closer to the average propensity to consume.

The MPC is not strongly influenced by interest rates; consumption tends to be stable relative to income. In theory one might think that higher interest rates would induce more saving (the substitution effect) but higher interest rates also mean than people do not have to save as much for the future.

Economists often distinguish between the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income, and the average propensity to consume out of temporary income, because if consumers expect a change in income to be permanent, then they have a greater incentive to increase their consumption. This implies that the Keynesian multiplier should be &quot;larger&quot; in response to permanent changes in income than it is in response to temporary changes in income (though the earliest Keynesian analyses ignored these subtleties). However, the distinction between permanent and temporary changes in income is often subtle in practice, and it is often quite difficult to designate a particular change in income as being permanent or temporary. What is more, the marginal propensity to consume should also be affected by factors such as the prevailing interest rate and the general level of consumer surplus that can be derived from purchasing.

<doc id="571004" wikidata="Q7153646" url="?curid=571004" title="Paul Smith's College">
<text>Paul Smith&#x27;s College is a private college in the hamlet/village of Paul Smiths, near the larger town of Brighton, Franklin County, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains. 

Established in 1946, Paul Smith&#x27;s College offers academic degrees of Associate, Bachelor of Arts, and Master of Arts. Its 14,000-acre campus is one of the largest college campuses in the world. As of 2023, approximately 600 students attend each year.

==History==
Paul Smith&#x27;s College was founded through a bequest of Phelps Smith, son of Paul Smith&#x27;s Hotel founder Apollos (&quot;Paul&quot;) Smith (1825–1912). Along with the money to start the college, Phelps also left more than an additional bequest of of land. Paul Smith&#x27;s is located northwest of Saranac Lake, in the hamlet / village of Paul Smiths nearby the Town of Brighton, in Franklin County, New York. Although the donation of money and surrounding land for the college was made in 1937, the college would not officially open until nine years later in 1946, when the first class of 150 students entered to study forestry and resort management. 

In 2015, Joan H. Mosher Weill, wife of Sanford I. &quot;Sandy&quot; Weill, a banker, financier, philanthropist and chairman of Citicorp bank in New York City, offered a $20 million dollars donation on the condition that the institution change its name to Joan Weill-Paul Smith&#x27;s College. Ms. Weill was a former trustee of the college. This change however would have violated Phelps Smith&#x27;s founding bequest, which required that the school be &quot;forever known&quot; as Paul Smith&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences. Justice John T. Ellis of the New York State Supreme Court later ruled that the college could not be renamed, and the proposed donation was withdrawn.

In 2023, the college proposed a merger with the Fedcap Rehabilitation Services (Fedcap), a Manhattan-based non-profit in New York City that provides vocational education to those who have disabilities that affect their ability to find employment, but that proposal was later shelved.

In 2024, the dining hall at Paul Smith&#x27;s College was renamed Morehouse Hall in honor of Stephen Warren Morehouse (1840–1882), an early employee of the Paul Smith&#x27;s Hotel and American Civil War (1861–1865) veteran of the Union Army who served in the famous 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment of some of the first Black/African American soldiers to serve and fight in the war (of which a famous Hollywood feature film &quot;Glory&quot; was made in 1989, starring Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman and Matthew Broderick).

== Academics ==
Classroom space is primarily located at Pickett Hall, Cantwell Hall, and Freer Science Hall. Auxiliary areas include The Joan Weill Adirondack Library, the campus&#x27; sawmill, the Saunders Sports Complex, the Joan Weill Student Center and the Paul Smith&#x27;s College VIC. Two on-campus restaurants, the Ganzi: Palm Training Restaurant and the A.P. Smith&#x27;s Bakery, are staffed by students and open to the public.

Paul Smith&#x27;s Fall 2021 acceptance rate was 75%. In the 2024 rankings for the Regional Colleges North category by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the college was ranked 25 out of 52 schools.

== Campus life ==
Most of the college population lives on campus. Residence halls are divided by class. Freshmen halls include Lydia Martin Smith Hall, Currier Hall, and Lakeside Hall. Incoming transfer students are housed in Franklin Hall. Upperclassmen share Essex, Clinton, Lambert, Blum House, Overlook, Saratoga, Alumni, Upper St. Regis, Lower St. Regis, and Hillside halls. Overlook Hall was opened in 2011 as a LEED-certified &quot;green&quot; dorm for upper-classmen.

Paul Smith&#x27;s rural location lends itself to many campus-based activities. Student-directed clubs administered under the Office of Student Activities include fishing and hunting, Adventure Sports Club, Society for Ecological Restoration, Society of American Foresters, the Wildlife Society, Student Government Association, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, PSC Snowcats, Anime and Gaming club, Fish and Game Club, and Adirondack Mycology club, among others.

The campus is located on Lower St. Regis Lake. Students have a beach, as well as docks and storage for canoes and kayaks.

The Lakeside Dining Hall is operated by Sodexo. Both the A.P. Smith&#x27;s Bakery and The Ganzi: Palm Training Restaurant in Cantwell Hall opens a few days a week each semester to sell student-produced products.

== Athletics ==
Paul Smith&#x27;s athletic teams are the Bobcats, but were formerly called the Falcons. The college is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association, primarily competing in the Yankee Small College Conference since the 2010–11 academic year. The Bobcats previously competed in the Sunrise Athletic Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics from 2002–03 to 2009–10.

Paul Smith&#x27;s competes in 14 different sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, ice hockey, rugby and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, ice hockey, rugby, soccer and volleyball; and co-ed sports include alpine skiing, biathlon, bass fishing, Esports, golf, marathon canoe, Nordic skiing, snowshoeing, trap shooting and woodsmen.

The Saunders Sports Complex houses the Bobcat Fitness Center, a gymnasium, and dance studio, which is open to the general public for a nominal fee. A -tall climbing wall was opened in the adjacent Buxton Annex gymnasium in 2010.

Timbersports take place in both Fall and Spring semesters, with teams practicing every month of the school year. Events include pole climbing, log birling, chopping, splitting, sawing, pulp toss, ax-throw, and pack-board relay.

The Paul Smith&#x27;s woodsmen team&#x27;s nine-year winning streak (from 1957–1966) in the sport&#x27;s biggest event, the Spring Meet, is the longest in the history of intercollegiate lumberjack/lumberjill competition. The school&#x27;s highly regarded squad travels to meets throughout the Northeast and Ontario, Canada.

Both the men and women&#x27;s soccer teams at Paul Smith&#x27;s compete in an annual rivalry game with the teams from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. The winner receives the Barkeater Cup. The PSC men&#x27;s soccer team won the Cup in 2014. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team participate in the Yankee Small College Conference regionally, and the USCAA on a national level.
In 2022, the Paul Smith&#x27;s College Men&#x27;s Nordic Ski team won the USCSA National Championships located in Lake Placid, NY. The men&#x27;s team won three out of the four events at the competition.

Paul Smith&#x27;s College won the 2024 U.S. Biathlon Collegiate National Championships.

The Paul Smith’s College women’s hockey team won the inaugural AAU College Hockey Women’s National Championship on March 10, 2024, when they defeated the University of Tampa 4-2 in West Chester, PA. Leah Coulombe was named Tournament MVP.

<doc id="571005" wikidata="Q5164722" url="?curid=571005" title="Consumer spending">
<text>Consumer spending is the total money spent on final goods and services by individuals and households.

There are two components of consumer spending: induced consumption (which is affected by the level of income) and autonomous consumption (which is not).

==Macroeconomic factors==

===Taxes===
Taxes are a tool in the adjustment of the economy. Tax policies designed by governments affect consumer groups, net consumer spending and consumer confidence. Economists expect tax manipulation to increase or decrease consumer spending, though the precise impact of specific manipulations are often the subject of controversy.

Underlying tax manipulation as a stimulant or suppression of consumer spending is an equation for gross domestic product (GDP). The equation is GDP = C + I + G + NX, where C is private consumption, I is private investment, G is government and NX is the net of exports minus imports. Increases in government spending create demand and economic expansion. However, government spending increases translates to tax increases or deficit spending. This creates a potential negative impact on private consumption, investment, and/or the balance of trade.

===Consumer sentiment===
Consumer sentiment is the general attitude of consumers toward the economy and the health of the fiscal markets, and they are a strong constituent of consumer spending. Sentiments have a powerful ability to cause fluctuations in the economy, because if the attitude of the consumer regarding the state of the economy is bad, then they will be reluctant to spend. Therefore, sentiments prove to be a powerful predictor of the economy, because when people have faith in the economy or in what they believe will soon occur, they will spend and invest with confidence. However sentiments do not always affect the spending habits of some people as much as they do for others. For example, some households set their spending strictly off of their income, so that their income closely equals, or nearly equals their consumption (including savings). Others rely on their sentiments to dictate how they spend their income and such.

===Government economic stimulus===
In times of economic trouble or uncertainty, the government often tries to rectify the issue by distributing economic stimuli, often in the form of rebates or checks. However such techniques have failed in the past for several reasons. As was discussed earlier, temporary financial reprieve rarely succeeds because people do not often like rapidly shifting their spending habits. Also, people are many times intelligent enough to realize that economic stimulus packages are due to economic downturns, and therefore they are even more reluctant to spend them. Instead they put them into savings.

==Data==

===United States===

In 1929, consumer spending was 75% of the nation&#x27;s economy. This grew to 83% in 1932, when business spending dropped. Consumer spending dropped to about 50% during World War II due to large expenditures by the government and lack of consumer products. Consumer spending in the US rose from about 62% of GDP in 1960, where it stayed until about 1981, and has since risen to 71% in 2013.

In the United States, the Consumer Spending figure published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis includes three broad categories of personal spending.
* Durable goods: motor vehicles and parts, furnishings and durable household equipment, recreational goods and vehicles, and other durable goods.
* Nondurable goods: food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption, clothing and footwear, gasoline and other energy goods, and other nondurable goods.
* Services: housing and utilities, healthcare, transportation services, recreation services, food services and accommodations, financial services and insurance, and other services.

For U.S. domestic consumer spending by population and income demographics collected by the U.S Census Bureau at the household level and analyzed and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, see the link at BLS.gov/CEX

<doc id="571011" wikidata="Q169976" url="?curid=571011" title="Northern Lights (Pullman novel)">
<text>Northern Lights (titled The Golden Compass in North America and some other countries) is a young-adult fantasy novel by Philip Pullman, published in 1995 by Scholastic UK. Set in a parallel universe, it follows the journey of Lyra Belacqua to the Arctic in search of her missing friend, Roger Parslow, and her imprisoned uncle, Lord Asriel, who has been conducting experiments with a mysterious substance known as &quot;Dust&quot;.

&quot;Northern Lights&quot; is the first book of the trilogy, &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; (1995 to 2000). Alfred A. Knopf published the first US edition April 1996, under the name &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, under which title it was adapted as a 2007 feature film and as a companion video game. The book has also been adapted as the first part of the 2019 TV series &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;.

Pullman won the 1995 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year&#x27;s outstanding British children&#x27;s book. For the 70th anniversary of the Medal, it was named one of the top ten winning works by a panel, composing the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite. &quot;Northern Lights&quot; won the public vote from that shortlist and was thus named the all-time &quot;Carnegie of Carnegies&quot; on 21 June 2007.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
The setting is a world dominated by the Magisterium (commonly called &quot;the Church&quot;), an international theocracy which actively suppresses heresy. In this world, humans&#x27; souls naturally exist outside of their bodies in the form of sentient &quot;dæmons&quot; in animal form which accompany, aid, and comfort their humans. An important plot device is the alethiometer, a truth-telling symbol reader. By setting the alethiometer&#x27;s hands to point to symbols around a dial a skilled practitioner can pose questions, which are answered by the movement of a further hand.

===Plot===
Twelve-year-old Lyra Belacqua runs wild with her dæmon Pantalaimon around Jordan College, Oxford, under the guardianship of the college&#x27;s Master. One day, she witnesses the Master poison wine intended for Lord Asriel. She warns Asriel, whom she believes is her uncle, not to drink the wine, then spies on his lecture about &quot;Dust&quot;, mysterious elementary particles attracted to adults more than to children. Asriel shows the college scholars images of a parallel universe seen through the Northern Lights amidst a concentration of Dust. The scholars agree to fund his controversial research, which is considered heretical by the oppressive Church.

Lyra&#x27;s best friend Roger goes missing, presumed kidnapped by child abductors known as the &quot;Gobblers&quot;. Mrs Coulter takes Lyra to her home in London, but before Lyra leaves Jordan, the Master entrusts her with an alethiometer, a strange truth-telling device, which she quickly learns to use intuitively. After several weeks, Lyra discovers that Coulter is the head of the Gobblers, or &quot;General Oblation Board&quot;, a secret Church-funded project. Horrified, Lyra flees into London and is found by the Gyptians, canal-faring nomads, many of whose children have also been abducted. They reveal to Lyra that Asriel and Coulter are her parents.

The Gyptians form an expedition to the Arctic with Lyra, where they believe the Gobblers are holding their children. They stop in Trollesund, where Lyra meets Iorek Byrnison, the dispossessed royal heir of the &quot;panserbjørne&quot; (armoured bears). Lyra uses her alethiometer to locate Iorek&#x27;s missing armour; in return, he and his human aeronaut friend, Lee Scoresby, join her group. She also learns that Lord Asriel has been exiled, guarded by the &quot;panserbjørne&quot; on Svalbard. Trollesund&#x27;s witch consul tells the Gyptians of a prophecy about Lyra which she must not know, and that the witch clans are choosing sides for an upcoming war.

The search party continues towards Bolvangar, the Gobbler research station. Guided by the alethiometer, Lyra detours at a village and discovers an abandoned child who has been cut from his dæmon and who soon dies. She realises the Gobblers are experimenting on children by severing the bond between human and dæmon, a soul-splitting process called intercision. Lyra and her companions are attacked by bounty hunters, and Lyra is captured and taken to Bolvangar, where she is briefly reunited with Roger before being sent to be separated from Pantalaimon. Just before this can occur, Coulter arrives and halts the intercision process. She tells Lyra that intercision prevents the onset of troubling adult emotions, though it has not yet been perfected.

Lyra activates Bolvangar&#x27;s emergency alarm, sets the station on fire, and evacuates the children, where they are rescued by Scoresby, Iorek, the Gyptians, and the witch clan of Serafina Pekkala, who battle the station attendants as Lyra, Roger, and Iorek flee in Scoresby&#x27;s hot air balloon. Lyra directs the witches to tow the balloon towards Asriel in Svalbard, but she falls out and is taken by the &quot;panserbjørne&quot; to the castle of their usurping king, Iofur Raknison. She tricks Iofur into fighting Iorek, who arrives with Roger to rescue Lyra. Iorek kills Iofur and regains his place as the rightful king.

Lyra, Iorek, and Roger continue onwards to Svalbard, where Asriel has continued his Dust research in exile. He tells Lyra all he knows of Dust: that it has spawned parallel universes, it is somehow connected to death and misery, and that the Church believes it is the physical basis of sin. Lord Asriel travels with Roger through the snow, Lyra and Iorek follow using the tracks of Asriel&#x27;s sled. Asriel ascends a mountain with Roger as Lyra and Iorek and his squadron of bears battle the witches that are allied with Asriel. Mrs Coulter and the Tartars arrive in a military airship and attack the bears. During the battle, Mrs Coulter follows Lyra to the top of the mountain, where Lord Asriel and Mrs Coulter embrace at the peak of the mountain where Asriel has set up his equipment. Suddenly, Lord Asriel severs Roger from his dæmon, killing Roger but releasing an enormous amount of energy that tears a hole in the Northern Lights into a parallel universe, through which he walks. Devastated, Lyra and Pantalaimon also pass through the opening in the sky.

==Characters==

All humans in &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, as well as witches, have a dæmon (pronounced &quot;demon&quot;), which is the physical manifestation of a person&#x27;s &quot;inner being&quot;, soul, or spirit. It takes the form of a creature (such as a moth, bird, dog, monkey, or snake) and is usually the opposite sex to its human counterpart. The dæmons of children have the ability to change form from one creature to another, but near the end of a child&#x27;s puberty, their dæmon &quot;settles&quot; into a permanent form, which reflects the person&#x27;s personality. When a person dies, the dæmon dies too. Armoured bears, cliff ghasts and other creatures do not have dæmons. An armoured bear&#x27;s armour is his soul.

*Lyra Belacqua and Pantalaimon: The principal characters. Lyra is described as having blue eyes and blond hair, along with being short for her age and quite thin. She is also brave, curious, and crafty. Her dæmon is Pantalaimon, nicknamed Pan. Because Lyra is still a child, Pan is still capable of changing into any shape he wishes &quot;(often a brown moth, a wildcat, a white ermine, or a mouse)&quot;. 
*Roger Parslow: Lyra&#x27;s friend, an orphan who works at Jordan College. When he is kidnapped and taken north, Lyra pursues him in hopes of rescuing him, meeting up with him again at Bolvangar.
*Lord Asriel: Ostensibly Lyra&#x27;s uncle, he is actually her father. His dæmon is Stelmaria, a snow leopard.
*Marisa Coulter: An agent of the Magisterium, who does not hesitate to manipulate the Church. She is intelligent and beautiful, but also ruthless and callous. She is actually Lyra&#x27;s mother and is unexpectedly kind to her. Her dæmon is a golden monkey who, unusually, is not named.
*Iorek Byrnison: Rightful king of the panserbjørne, armoured bears with human-level intelligence, Iorek has been tricked out of his armour and reduced to a slave of the human village Trollesund. After Lyra helps him recover his armour, he becomes very protective of her and joins the expedition to find the children seized by Gobblers. 
*Iofur Raknison: A panserbjørn who has usurped Iorek Byrnison&#x27;s authority as king. 
*Serafina Pekkala: A witch who closely follows Lyra on her travels. She is aware of Lyra&#x27;s destiny. Serafina&#x27;s dæmon is Kaisa, a snow goose, who is capable of physically moving separately from Serafina over long distances, a quality that only witches&#x27; dæmons possess innately. 
*Lee Scoresby: A Texan aeronaut who transports Lyra in his balloon. He and Iorek Byrnison are good friends and Lee comes to see Lyra as a surrogate daughter. His dæmon is Hester, an arctic snow hare.
*Ma Costa: A Gyptian woman whose son, Billy Costa has been abducted by the &quot;Gobblers&quot;. She rescues Lyra from Mrs Coulter and takes her to John Faa. 
*John Faa: The King of all Gyptian people. He travels with Lyra to the North with his companion Farder Coram.

==Title==
During pre-publication of the novel, the prospective trilogy was known in Britain as &quot;The Golden Compasses&quot;, an allusion to God&#x27;s poetic delineation of the world. The term is from a line in Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, where it denotes the drafting compass God used to establish and set a circular boundary of all creation:

&lt;poem&gt;
Then staid the fervid wheels, and in his hand
He took the golden compasses, prepared
In God&#x27;s eternal store, to circumscribe
This universe, and all created things:
One foot he centred, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure
&lt;/poem&gt;
— Book 7, lines 224–229

In the US, publisher Knopf had been calling the first book &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; (singular), which it mistakenly understood as a reference to Lyra&#x27;s alethiometer (depicted on the front cover shown at the head of this article), because of the device&#x27;s resemblance to a navigational compass. By the time Pullman had replaced &quot;The Golden Compasses&quot; with &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; as the name of the trilogy, the US publisher had become so attached to the original title that it insisted on publishing the first book as &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; rather than as &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, the title used in Britain and Australia.

==Critical reception==

===Awards===
Pullman won both the annual Carnegie Medal for British children&#x27;s books and the annual Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize for &quot;Northern Lights&quot;, an award which authors can only win once in their lifetime. Six books have won both awards in 45 years through 2011.

In the US, &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; was named &quot;Booklist&quot; Editors Choice – Top of the List, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; Book of the Year, a &quot;Horn Book&quot; Fanfare Honor Book, and a &quot;Bulletin&quot; Blue Ribbon Book in 1996.

===Religion===
Some critics have asserted that the trilogy and the movie portray organised churches and religion negatively, while others – notably Dr Rowan Williams, formerly Archbishop of Canterbury – have argued that Pullman&#x27;s works should be included in religious-education courses. Journalist Peter Hitchens views the series &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; as a direct rebuttal of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; by C. S. Lewis. Literary critic Alan Jacobs of Wheaton College in Illinois suggested that Pullman had recast the Narnia series, replacing a theist world-view with a Rousseauist one.

== Adaptations ==

New Line Cinema released a feature-film adaptation of the novel named &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; in December 2007. Chris Weitz adapted the novel and also directed the film. Dakota Blue Richards, in her film debut, played Lyra. The cast included Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Ian McKellen, Sam Elliott, Derek Jacobi, and Christopher Lee.

In 1996 Natasha Richardson narrated an audiobook version of &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. The trilogy, &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;, was abridged in a dramatisation by BBC Worldwide, published on 1 January 2003. It was also adapted unabridged and released by BBC Audiobooks, narrated by Philip Pullman. The cast includes: Joanna Wyatt as Lyra, Alison Dowling as Mrs Coulter, Seán Barrett as Lord Asriel and Iorek Byrnison, and Stephen Thorne as the Master and Farder Coram. An audiobook version narrated by Pullman and featuring a full cast was released in 1999.

The National Theatre in London staged a two-part adaptation of the trilogy in 2003–2004.

Sega released a video game of the movie adaptation of the book, titled &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; and developed by Shiny Entertainment, on 4 December 2007. Players assume the role of Lyra as she travels through the frozen wastes of the North in an attempt to rescue her friend kidnapped by a mysterious organisation known as the Gobblers. Travelling with her are an armoured polar bear and her dæmon Pantalaimon (Pan). Together, they must use a truth-telling alethiometer and other items to explore the land and fight their way through confrontations to help Lyra&#x27;s friend. &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; features a mix of fighting and puzzle-solving with three characters.

On 3 November 2019, BBC One began broadcast of their TV adaptation of &quot;His Dark Materials&quot;. This first series mainly covers events from &quot;Northern Lights&quot;. It premiered on HBO on 4 November 2019 in the United States. The series was produced by Bad Wolf and New Line Cinema and directed by Tom Hooper. Cast members included Dafne Keen, James McAvoy, Ruth Wilson, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ian Gelder, and Ruta Gedmintas.

<text>Dan Gillmor is an American technology writer and columnist. He was director of News Co/Lab, an initiative to elevate news literacy and awareness, at Arizona State University&#x27;s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Dan Gillmor is also in the board of directors of The Signals Network, a non-profit organization supporting whistleblowers.

==Career==
Before becoming a journalist, Gillmor worked as a musician for seven years. During the 1986–87 academic year he was a Michigan Journalism Fellow at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he studied history, political theory and economics. Gillmor worked at the &quot;Kansas City Times&quot; and several newspapers in Vermont, followed by six years at the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;.

From 1994 to 2005, Gillmor was a columnist at the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, Silicon Valley’s daily newspaper, during which time he became a leading chronicler of the dot-com boom and its subsequent bust. Starting in October 1999, he wrote a weblog for &quot;The Mercury News&quot;, which is believed to have been the first by a journalist for a traditional media company. Gillmor&#x27;s &quot;eJournal&quot; archives were believed to be lost but have been found in the Internet Archive and are now restored at Bayosphere.com.

Gillmor left &quot;The Mercury News&quot; in January 2005 to work on a start-up venture in citizen journalism called &quot;Bayosphere&quot;, which aimed to &quot;make it easier for the public to report and publish on the Internet.&quot; Launched in May 2005, &quot;Bayosphere&quot; closed in January 2006.

After closing &quot;Bayosphere&quot;, Gillmor moved on to a new project, the Center for Citizen Media, a non-profit organization affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley&#x27;s Graduate School of Journalism and the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University Law School.

In 2007, Gillmor co-founded Dopplr, an online travel application project.

In November 2007, Gillmor was named founding director of Arizona State University&#x27;s new Knight Center for Digital Media Entrepreneurship at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Dan Gillmor is a board member of the Global Editors Network since its creation in April 2011.

;Awards and honors
Gillmor won the EFF Pioneer Award in 2002.

==Works==
;Books
Dan Gillmor is the author of &quot;We the Media&quot; (2004), which describes the Internet as an opportunity for independent journalists to challenge the consolidation of traditional media and contains Gillmor&#x27;s widely cited realization: &quot;my readers know more than I do.&quot; The book offers a guide to new internet tools for journalists, including weblogs, RSS, SMS, peer-to-peer, and predicts how these tools will change journalism. In 2009, Gillmor published &quot;Mediactive&quot;, a book on digital media literacy. One review noted that the book&#x27;s &quot;thesis in itself is neither new nor original&quot;, but that the book represents &quot;the first time someone has put it all down in one place&quot;.

<text>State University of New York at Morrisville (formerly Morrisville State College) or SUNY Morrisville is a public college with two locations in New York, one in Morrisville and one in Norwich. It is part of the State University of New York system. It offers one master&#x27;s degree, 21 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 34 associate degrees, and two certificate programs, and is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

== Location ==
SUNY Morrisville is located in Central New York, southeast of Syracuse in the village of Morrisville, New York. Morrisville is near the towns of Cazenovia, to the west, and Hamilton, to the east.

==History==
The university was initially established in 1908 as the New York State School of Agriculture at Morrisville.

==Research==
===Industrial hemp===
SUNY Morrisville was one of the first campuses to hold a license to grow industrial hemp for grain and fiber research applications. This research program is being led by Agronomy professor Dr. Gilbert Jenkins and Morrisville students. While Industrial Hemp is very responsive to nitrogen inputs in terms on increased grain production, at the same time, fiber quality may decrease with high N inputs. We are looking to develop a grain yield response curve for nitrogen fertilization, test a variety of fertilization timing options, and sources of N fertilizer to maximize grain production. Fiber quantity and quality will be measured to determine if it is possible to harvest high quality fiber from a dual purpose crop, or whether nitrogen recommendations are divergent for fiber and grain production purposes. 

Recently the college announced the creation of a cannabis industry minor.

===Seahorses===
SUNY Morrisville Aquatic Science and Aquaculture Program houses a breeding colony of &quot;Hippocampus erectus&quot;, the lined seahorse, and is currently working on experiments that address larval seahorse health and the conservation of seahorses.

<doc id="571026" wikidata="Q884271" url="?curid=571026" title="Blindness and education">
<text>The subject of blindness and education has included evolving approaches and public perceptions of how best to address the special needs of blind students. The practice of institutionalizing the blind in asylums has a history extending back over a thousand years, but it was not until the 18th century that authorities created schools for them where blind children, particularly those more privileged, were usually educated in such specialized settings. These institutions provided simple vocational and adaptive training, as well as grounding in academic subjects offered through alternative formats. Literature, for example, was being made available to blind students by way of embossed Roman letters.

==Ancient Egypt==
The Ancient Egyptians were the first civilisation to display an interest in the causes and cures for disabilities and during some periods blind people are recorded as representing a substantial portion of the poets and musicians in society. In the Middle Kingdom (–1640 BCE), blind harpists are depicted on tomb walls. They were not exclusively interested in the causes and cures for blindness but also the social care of the individual.

==Early institutions for the blind==
An early institution for the blind was the &quot;Hospital Royal des Quinze Vingts&quot; established by the French monarch for soldiers who had lost their sight. Applicants had to be both blind and poor and they received 24 sous a day for their food and clothing. Some of the residents produced craft work but they received no formal instruction.

Asylums for the Industrious Blind were established in Edinburgh and Bristol in 1765, but the first school anywhere, to expressly teach the blind was set up by Edward Rushton in Liverpool as the School for the Instruction of the Indigent Blind in 1791. It taught the blind children skills in manual crafts although there was no formal education as such. Other institutions set up at that time were: the School for the Indigent Blind in London and the Asylum and School for the Indigent Blind at Norwich.

In France, the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles was established in 1784 by Valentin Haüy. Haüy&#x27;s impulse to help the blind began when he witnessed the blind being mocked during a religious street festival. In May 1784, at Saint-Germain-des-Prés, he met a young beggar, François Lesueur; he was his first student. He developed a method of raised letters, to teach Lesueur to read, and compose sentences. He made rapid progress, and Haüy announced the success, in September 1784 in the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot;, then receiving encouragement from the French Academy of Sciences.

With the help of the Philanthropic Society Haüy founded the Institute for Blind Youth, the Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles, in February 1785. Building on the philanthropic spinning workshop for the blind, the institution of Blind Children was dedicated on 26 December 1786. Its purpose was to educate students and teach them manual work: spinning, and letterpress.

==Braille system==
Louis Braille attended Haüy&#x27;s school in 1819 and later taught there. He soon became determined to fashion a system of reading and writing that could bridge the critical gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: &quot;Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about.&quot;
In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain Charles Barbier of the French Army. Barbier&#x27;s &quot;night writing&quot; was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions could be interpreted entirely by the fingers, letting soldiers share information on the battlefield without having light or needing to speak.

The captain&#x27;s code turned out to be too complex to use in its original military form, but it inspired Braille to develop a system of his own. Braille worked tirelessly on his ideas, and his system was largely completed by 1824, when he was just fifteen years of age. From Barbier&#x27;s night writing, he innovated by simplifying its form and maximizing its efficiency. He made uniform columns for each letter, and he reduced the twelve raised dots to six. He published his system in 1829, and by the second edition in 1837 had discarded the dashes because they were too difficult to read. Crucially, Braille&#x27;s smaller cells were capable of being recognized as letters with a single touch of a finger.

==Education for the blind==

The first school with a focus on proper education was the Yorkshire School for the Blind in England. Established in 1835, it taught arithmetic, reading and writing, while at the school of the London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read founded in 1838 a general education was seen as the ideal that would contribute the most to the prosperity of the blind. Educator Thomas Lucas introduced the Lucas Type, an early form of embossed text different from the Braille system.

Another important institution at the time was the General Institution for the Blind at Birmingham (1847), which included training for industrial jobs alongside a more general curriculum. The first school for blind adults was founded in 1866 at Worcester and was called the College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.

In 1889 the Edgerton Commission published a report that recommended that the blind should receive compulsory education from the age of 5–16 years. The law was finally passed in 1893, as an element of the broader Elementary Education Act. This act ensured that blind people up to the age of 16 years were entitled to an Elementary-Level Education as well as to Vocational Training.

The 1880s also saw the introduction of compulsory elementary education for the Blind throughout the United States. (However, most states of the United States did not pass laws specifically making elementary education compulsory &quot;for the blind&quot; until after 1900.)
By this time, reading codes - chiefly braille and New York Point - had gained favor among educators as embossed letters (such as Moon type) were said by some to be difficult to learn and cumbersome to use, and so (DOT CODES) were either newly created or imported from well-established schools in Europe. Though New York Point was widely accepted for a time, Braille has since emerged the victor in what some blindness historians have dubbed &quot;the War of the Dots&quot;.

The more respected residential schools were staffed by competent teachers who kept abreast of the latest developments in educational theory. While some of their methods seem archaic by today&#x27;s standards - particularly where their Vocational Training options are concerned - their efforts did pave the way for the education and integration of blind students in the 20th century. 

The early 20th century saw a handful of blind students enrolled in their neighborhood schools, with special educational supports. Most still attended residential institutions, but that number dropped steadily as the years wore on - especially after the white cane was adopted into common use as a mobility tool and symbol of blindness in the 1930s.

==Aniruddha&#x27;s Bank for The Blind==

An estimated 253 million people live with vision impairment: 36 million are blind and 217 million have moderate to severe vision impairment in the world with nearly 80 lakhs in India itself out of which number of blind students is close to 30 lakhs. As per the law of nature, when one sensory organ does not function in human body, the other sensory organs become more active to compensate for the defect. In the case of blind persons, hearing and touch are very active and play an important role.
Aniruddha&#x27;s Bank for The Blind, conceptualized and operationalized by Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation, Mumbai, India, supports education for the blind in an affectionate and unique way. The bank records the study curriculum in 12 languages like English, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam, Telugu, and Sanskrit by the people who are well versed in their own mother tongue. To date, the recorded CDs have made a difference in the lives of blind people in almost 26 states of India and a few regions of neighbouring Pakistan too. The bank maintains high quality and standard of the CDs by regular and diligent verification.

==Today==

Most blind and visually impaired students now attend their neighborhood schools, often aided in their educational pursuits by regular teachers of academics and by a team of professionals who train them in alternative skills: Orientation and Mobility (O and M) training - instruction in independent travel - is usually taught by contractors educated in that area, as is Braille. Blind children may also need special training in understanding spatial concepts, and in self-care, as they are often unable to learn visually and through imitation as other children do.

Since only ten percent of those registered as legally blind have no usable vision, many students are also taught to use their remaining sight to maximum effect, so that some read print (with or without optical aids) and travel without canes.

A combination of necessary training tailored to the unique needs of each student and solid academics goes a long way towards producing blind and visually impaired students capable of dealing with the world independently.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Sri Lanka on 2 April 2004. The ruling United National Party of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was defeated, winning only eighty two seats in the 225-member Sri Lankan parliament. The opposition United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance won 105 seats. While this was eight seats short of an absolute majority, the Alliance was able to form a government.

On 6 April, President Chandrika Kumaratunga appointed former Minister of Labour Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister.

==Parties==

The United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance was formed as an alliance between President Kumaratunga&#x27;s party, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), and the leftist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Other parties that belong to the People&#x27;s Alliance, such as the Communist Party of Sri Lanka, the Democratic United National Front, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and the Sri Lanka Mahajana Pakshaya, later joined UPFA.

In the 2001 elections, the People&#x27;s Alliance and Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna had fought separately. Then the JVP won 9.1% of the vote and sixteen seats. At this election it is reported than as many as thirty nine JVP members won seats as UPFA candidates.

The runner-up in the election was the United National Front (UNF), the front led by the United National Party. In addition to the UNP, the UNF also had candidates from minor parties such as Ceylon Workers Congress.

Other parties winning seats were the Buddhist, Sinhala nationalist outfit Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU), the pro-LTTE alliance Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) and the Eelam People&#x27;s Democratic Party (EPDP). The Democratic Peoples Liberation Front (the political wing of PLOTE) lost their parliamentary representation.

==Campaign==

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe&#x27;s UNF government had been in limbo since October 2003, when President Kumaratunga declared a state of emergency and took three key cabinet portfolios for her party. During the campaign, she argued that Wickremasinghe had been too soft on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and promised to take a harder line. The UNF, for its part, stressed the economic gains that had been made with the ceasefire and the need to find a negotiated solution to the civil war.

==Voting==

Polling booths opened at 07:00 local time and remained open until 16:00 (01:00 to 10:00 UTC). A total of 10,670 polling stations were installed to receive votes from 12.9 million eligible voters. Voter turnout was high, at around 75%.

The backdrop to polling day was tense, with continued guerrilla activity by Tamil Tiger separatists and five politically motivated murders in the run-up to the election. However, except for a slightly lower turnout in the Eastern Province, Sri Lanka and allegations of fraud in the North, the election was calm and orderly.

Sri Lanka&#x27;s Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said that despite reported cases of electoral malpractice in certain polling stations in six electoral districts, there would be no fresh elections in these areas and the results issued by the Commission were final.

==Results==
The United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance vote and seat totals are compared with the combined People&#x27;s Alliance and JVP vote and seat counts at the 2001 election.

<text>The State University of New York at Farmingdale (Farmingdale State College or SUNY Farmingdale) is a public college in East Farmingdale, New York, United States. It is part of the State University of New York. The college was chartered in 1912 as a school of applied agriculture under the name of New York State School Of Agriculture on Long Island. As of the fall semester of 2016, Farmingdale State College had an enrollment of 9,237.

==History==
The State University of New York at Farmingdale, established in 1912, originally began as the New York State School of Agriculture on Long Island. The proposal for the college&#x27;s founding was put forth by State Assemblyman John Lupton in 1909. Currently, Lupton Hall, which accommodates the departments of Chemistry and Physics, as well as the School of Engineering Technology, is named in his honor.

Two of the oldest buildings on campus are Hicks Hall and Cutler Hall, which were constructed in 1914 and were originally called the Horticulture and Agronomy Buildings, respectively. The buildings house four oil on canvas murals, painted in 1936 by local artists Frederick Marshall and C. E. Lessing as a part of the Works Progress Administration. The murals depict agricultural scenes, including wheat threshing, rice harvesting, and cotton picking.

Ward Hall, also constructed in 1914, was the original dormitory and now houses College offices, including Alumni Relations and Business Outreach. When the college first admitted students in March 1916, Ward Hall was not yet completed. Students slept instead in temporary quarters on the upper level of Conklin Hall, which was then the physical plant.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. delivered the address at the college&#x27;s second commencement exercises on May 26, 1920. That same year, the school changed its name for the first time, becoming the New York State School Of Applied Agriculture on Long Island. 

Later historical buildings include Knapp Hall, completed in 1937, and Thompson Hall, completed in 1938, which were each built in the Georgian Colonial style.

A Memorial Oak was planted on June 4, 1921, to honor American soldiers killed in World War I. The Oak was planted in soil collected from all 48 states as well as from the allied nations from the war. A plaque gifted by the Class of 1927 reads:

This Oak, Planted June 4, 1921, Commemorates The Efforts, Sacrifices And Achievements Of All Americans Who Gave Their Lives In The World War. Its Roots Rest in Soil From All The Allied Nations, From Every State And Dependency Of Our Country, From The Bloody Angle Of Gettysburg And From The Arc De Triomphe Of France. On Fames Eternal Camping-Ground Their Silent Tents Are Spread, And Glory Guards With Solemn Round The Bivouac Of The Dead.

The school&#x27;s name would change seven more times before its current name was adopted in 1993; these changes included the State Institute Of Applied Agriculture (1924), State Institute Of Agriculture (1939), Long Island Agricultural and Technical Institute (1946), SUNY Long Island Agricultural and Technical Institute at Farmingdale (1953), Agricultural and Technical College at Farmingdale (1966), and SUNY College of Technology at Farmingdale (1987).

<text>SkiFree is a single-player skiing computer game created by Chris Pirih and released with &quot;Microsoft Entertainment Pack 3&quot; for Windows 3.0 in October 1991. The player controls a skier on a mountain slope, avoiding obstacles while racing against time or performing stunts for points, depending on the game mode.

&quot;SkiFree&quot; was well-received upon release, with critics focusing on its simplicity and graphics. The game was ported to Macintosh and, years later, to Game Boy Color and iOS. Pirih also released a free, updated 32-bit Windows version after rediscovering his original source code. &quot;SkiFree&quot; remains popular among the gaming community and is often remembered for its Abominable Snowman, which pursues the player after they finish a full run.

In 2020, Microsoft released &quot;Surf&quot;, a game included with Microsoft Edge heavily inspired by &quot;SkiFree&quot;. A winter skin where the player skis instead of surfs and must run from the &quot;SkiFree&quot; Abominable Snowman was added to the game in 2021.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;SkiFree&quot; is a casual single-player sports simulator wherein the player uses the keyboard or the mouse to control a skier across a white background representing snow on a mountainside. The object of the game is to ski down an endless slope and avoid the obstacles (trees, stumps, dogs, etc.). The player can also opt to partake in three modes: slalom, freestyle, and tree slalom. In slalom, players must properly ski around flags in an attempt to complete the run with the shortest time possible. Tree slalom adds obstacles to the slalom run. In freestyle, players ski downhill and jump off ramps while racking up points by performing tricks. Deductions are imposed for colliding into obstacles or failing to land properly after a stunt. When the player passes the 2,000-meter mark, the Abominable Snowman appears and starts to chase the player, eating them when it catches them.

== Development ==
While &quot;SkiFree&quot; creator Chris Pirih was a student at the University of Puget Sound, he wrote a text-based game called &quot;Ski&quot; in Fortran for the VAX/VMS operating system, inspired by Activision&#x27;s Atari 2600 game &quot;Skiing&quot;. Later, as a programmer for Microsoft he was writing programming utilities used in the development of software such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. He had been focused on developing for the OS/2 operating system, but in 1991 decided to learn to write for the newly released Windows 3.0, and so created a new version of his skiing game in the programming language C, replacing the text-based environment with graphics. He called the game &quot;WinSki&quot;, and added exploitable, fanciful elements to demonstrate the new operating system&#x27;s functionality, such as staining the snow yellow after crashing into numerous dogs and certain tree stumps transforming into mushrooms when skied on backwards.
Although he developed it on his home computer for his own education and entertainment, &quot;WinSki&quot; attracted the attention of a program manager for the &quot;Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot; (&quot;MEP&quot;) when he noticed Pirih playing it at work. At that time, the first &quot;MEP&quot; had become so successful that the &quot;MEP&quot; team was designing two more. In October 1991, Microsoft shipped &quot;MEP&quot;s &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; for Windows 3.0, the latter pack containing Pirih&#x27;s game renamed and marketed by Microsoft as &quot;SkiFree&quot;. It was distributed on Verbatim 3.5-inch GameSampler floppy disks, bundled with packs of 10 other blank floppy disks in the early 1990s.

== Ports ==

Since its debut, &quot;SkiFree&quot; has seen several ports and rereleases. &quot;SkiFree&quot; was featured in the &quot;Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot; in 1994 and was available as a port for the Macintosh. It was also one of seven games included in the 2000 Game Boy Color title &quot;Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack&quot;. On April 4, 2005, Pirih announced the creation and release of a 32-bit version of &quot;SkiFree&quot; on his website for free, after rediscovering the game&#x27;s source code that year, which he had lost when he was developing a second version of the game in 1993, leading to its abandonment for other projects.

In January 2013, mobile games developer GearSprout developed and released iOS ports of &quot;SkiFree&quot; and &quot;Rodent&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. The company had already released &quot;SkeeFree&quot;, a skiing game with identical assets. In a &quot;Destructoid&quot; interview with GearSprout co-founder Tommy Tornroos, he explained that the company contacted Microsoft about porting their titles, and Microsoft responded that they were &quot;no longer claiming rights&quot; to them. However, the &quot;SkiFree&quot; trademark was reserved by an unspecified entity, leading to the release of &quot;SkeeFree&quot;. The &quot;SkiFree&quot; trademark later expired, and the name of the GearSprout game was updated as &quot;SkiFree&quot; when it was released alongside &quot;Rodent&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. &quot;SkiFree&quot; was included in &quot;The Windows 3.x Showcase&quot; and uploaded to the Internet Archive in February 2016, becoming the most popular item on the website within a week.

In May 2020, Microsoft released &quot;Surf&quot;, a surfing-themed game inspired by &quot;SkiFree&quot; into its Microsoft Edge browser, accessible by typing the special URL &quot;edge://surf&quot; on the address bar. It is also available when the browser is disconnected from the Internet, in a similar vein to the &quot;Dinosaur Game&quot; on Google Chrome. A 2021 update changed the game to depict a skier who is chased by the &quot;SkiFree&quot; Abominable Snowman instead of the game&#x27;s usual kraken.

== Reception ==
&quot;SkiFree&quot; attained a cult status in the PC community. In his 1992 review for &quot;MEP&quot;s &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, Richard Mansfield of &quot;Game Player&#x27;s PC Entertainment&quot; favorably rated them as &quot;visually sophisticated and...entertaining&quot; as the first &quot;Pack&quot;. While ranking &quot;Klotski&quot; as the best of the packs and only noting &quot;SkiFree&quot; as a &quot;simple skiing simulation&quot;, he recommended all of the sixteen games and praised each of them for taking advantage of effects that &quot;show off the visual beauty that Windows can bring to a computer.&quot; In another 1992 review, Barry Simon of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; described the game&#x27;s graphics as humorous and &quot;not very extensive&quot;, and while he chose &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; of &quot;Entertainment Pack 2&quot; as the game to purchase as a standalone title, at a bargain of per title, he recommended both of the packs. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described the &quot;MEP&quot; franchise as providing short gaming experiences, and noted its lead in the &quot;gaming lite&quot; category. By September 1992, the first three &quot;MEP&quot;s sold a total of over 500,000 copies.

&quot;SkiFree&quot; continues to receive critical acclaim in retrospective reviews. Josh Augustine of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; cited it as one of his favorite games of his childhood. Lisa Foiles of &quot;The Escapist&quot; ranked it No. 1 on its list of Top 5 Ski / Snowboard Games, calling it an &quot;undeniable classic.&quot; &quot;Computer Power User&quot; described the game as a &quot;killer app&quot;, noting that &quot;SkiFree&quot; was not particularly groundbreaking, but as one of the &quot;MEP 3&quot; titles, it &quot;stood apart from &quot;Minesweeper&quot; and the various card and board-game translations that dominated the software bundles.&quot; Brittany Vincent of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; characterized it as an endless runner, rationalizing that &quot;SkiFree&quot; had no ending and that the course would loop to the top of the map when players reached the bottom. In another &quot;PC Gamer&quot; article highlighting the history of trees in video gaming, Matt Elliott characterized the game&#x27;s trees as &quot;mean, twisted little saplings&quot; that threaten to ruin the player&#x27;s course. Games journalist Alfie Bown described the way other popular Windows games required concentration or mental energy, playing into the operating system&#x27;s reputation for usefulness and productivity. He contrasted it with the &quot;totally anachronistic&quot; &quot;SkiFree&quot;, a more casual &quot;subversive alternative.&quot;

Retrospective reviews for &quot;SkiFree&quot; frequently focus on the obscure nature of the Abominable Snow Monster. Benj Edwards of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; rated &quot;SkiFree&quot; as the best of &quot;MEP 3&quot; because of the humorous inclusion of the Abominable Snow Monster. James Kozanitis of &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; rated it No. 2 on their Top 5 Yetis in Video Games list. Alec Meer of &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; opined that the Monster changed the tone of the game from being a sports game to being &quot;the world&#x27;s most dangerous sport&quot;, where the only ending condition is the Monster&#x27;s devouring the skier. Vincent noted fan theories that attempt to explain the Monster&#x27;s background, as well as theories on how to supposedly outrun it (apart from pressing the key to accelerate beyond the normal limits).
