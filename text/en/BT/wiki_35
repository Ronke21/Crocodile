<text>In architecture, functionalism is the principle that buildings should be designed based solely on their purpose and function. An international functionalist architecture movement emerged in the wake of World War I, as part of the wave of Modernism. Its ideas were largely inspired by a desire to build a new and better world for the people, as broadly and strongly expressed by the social and political movements of Europe after the extremely devastating world war. In this respect, functionalist architecture is often linked with the ideas of socialism and modern humanism.

A new slight addition to this new wave of architecture was that not only should buildings and houses be designed around the purpose of functionality, architecture should also be used as a means to physically create a better world and a better life for people in the broadest sense. This new functionalist architecture had the strongest impact in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, the USSR and the Netherlands, and from the 1930s also in Scandinavia and Finland.

This principle is a matter of confusion and controversy within the profession, particularly in regard to modern architecture, as it is less self-evident than it first appears.

== History of functionalism ==
The theoretical articulation of functionalism in buildings can be traced back to the Vitruvian triad, where &quot;utilitas&quot; (variously translated as &#x27;commodity&#x27;, &#x27;convenience&#x27;, or &#x27;utility&#x27;) stands alongside &quot;firmitas&quot; (firmness) and &quot;venustas&quot; (beauty) as one of three classic goals of architecture. Functionalist views were typical of some Gothic Revival architects. In particular, Augustus Welby Pugin wrote that &quot;there should be no features about a building which are not necessary for convenience, construction, or propriety&quot; and &quot;all ornament should consist of enrichment of the essential construction of the building&quot;.

In 1896, Chicago architect Louis Sullivan coined the phrase Form follows function. However, this aphorism does not relate to a contemporary understanding of the term &#x27;function&#x27; as utility or the satisfaction of user needs; it was instead based in metaphysics, as the expression of organic essence and could be paraphrased as meaning &#x27;destiny&#x27;.

In the mid-1930s, functionalism began to be discussed as an aesthetic approach rather than a matter of design integrity (use). The idea of functionalism was conflated with a lack of ornamentation, which is a different matter. It became a pejorative term associated with the baldest and most brutal ways to cover space, like cheap commercial buildings and sheds, then finally used, for example in academic criticism of Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s geodesic domes, simply as a synonym for &#x27;gauche&#x27;.

For 70 years the influential American architect Philip Johnson held that the profession has no functional responsibility whatsoever, and this is one of the many views today. The position of postmodern architect Peter Eisenman is based on a user-hostile theoretical basis and even more extreme: &quot;I don&#x27;t do function.&quot;

== Modernism ==

Popular notions of modern architecture are heavily influenced by the work of the Franco-Swiss architect Le Corbusier and the German architect Mies van der Rohe. Both were functionalists at least to the extent that their buildings were radical simplifications of previous styles. In 1923, Mies van der Rohe was working in Weimar Germany, and had begun his career of producing radically simplified, lovingly detailed structures that achieved Sullivan&#x27;s goal of inherent architectural beauty. Le Corbusier famously said &quot;a house is a machine for living in&quot;; his 1923 book &quot;Vers une architecture&quot; was, and still is, very influential, and his early built work such as the Villa Savoye in Poissy, France, is thought of as prototypically function.

== In Europe ==
=== Czechoslovakia ===
The former Czechoslovakia was an early adopter of the functionalist style, with notable examples such as Villa Tugendhat in Brno, designed by Mies van der Rohe in 1928, Villa Müller in Prague, designed by Adolf Loos in 1930, and the majority of the city of Zlín, developed by the Bata shoe company as a factory town in the 1920s and designed by Le Corbusier&#x27;s student František Lydie Gahura.

Numerous villas, apartment buildings and interiors, factories, office blocks and department stores can be found in the functionalist style throughout the country, which industrialised rapidly in the early 20th century while embracing the Bauhaus-style architecture that was emerging concurrently in Germany. Large urban extensions to Brno in particular contain numerous apartment buildings in the functionalist style, while the domestic interiors of Adolf Loos in Plzeň are also notable for their application of functionalist principles.

=== Nordic &quot;funkis&quot; ===

In Scandinavia and Finland, the international movement and ideas of modernist architecture became widely known among architects at the 1930 Stockholm Exhibition, under the guidance of director and Swedish architect Gunnar Asplund. Enthusiastic architects collected their ideas and inspirations in the manifesto &quot;acceptera&quot; and in the years thereafter, a functionalist architecture emerged throughout Scandinavia. The genre involves some peculiar features unique to Scandinavia and it is often referred to as &quot;funkis&quot;, to distinguish it from functionalism in general. Some of the common features are flat roofing, stuccoed walls, architectural glazing and well-lit rooms, an industrial expression and nautical-inspired details, including round windows. The global stock market crisis and economic meltdown in 1929, instigated the needs to use affordable materials, such as brick and concrete, and to build quickly and efficiently. These needs became another signature of the Nordic version of functionalist architecture, in particular in buildings from the 1930s, and carried over into modernist architecture when industrial serial production became much more prevalent after World War II.

As most architectural styles, Nordic funkis was international in its scope and several architects designed Nordic funkis buildings throughout the region. Some of the most active architects working internationally with this style, includes Edvard Heiberg, Arne Jacobsen and Alvar Aalto. Nordic funkis features prominently in Scandinavian urban architecture, as the need for urban housing and new institutions for the growing welfare states exploded after World War II. Funkis had its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s, but functionalist architecture continued to be built long into the 1960s. These later structures, however, tend to be categorized as modernism in a Nordic context.

==== Denmark ====
Vilhelm Lauritzen, Arne Jacobsen and C.F. Møller were among the most active and influential Danish architects of the new functionalist ideas and Arne Jacobsen, Poul Kjærholm, Kaare Klint, and others, extended the new approach to design in general, most notably furniture which evolved to become Danish modern. Some Danish designers and artists who did not work as architects are sometimes also included in the Danish functionalist movement, such as Finn Juhl, Louis Poulsen and Poul Henningsen. In Denmark, bricks were largely preferred over reinforced concrete as construction material, and this included funkis buildings. Apart from institutions and apartment blocks, more than 100,000 single-family funkis houses were built in the years 1925–1945. However, the truly dedicated funkis design was often approached with caution. Many residential buildings only included some signature funkis elements such as round windows, corner windows or architectural glazing to signal modernity while not provoking conservative traditionalists too much. This branch of restrained approach to the funkis design created the Danish version of the bungalow building.

Fine examples of Danish functionalist architecture are the now listed Kastrup Airport 1939 terminal by Vilhelm Lauritzen, Aarhus University (by C. F. Møller et al.) and Aarhus City Hall (by Arne Jacobsen et al.), all including furniture and lamps specially designed for these buildings in the functionalist spirit. The largest functionalist complex in the Nordic countries is the 30,000-sq. m. residential compound of Hostrups Have in Copenhagen.

==== Finland ====
Some of the most prolific and notable architects in Finland, working in the funkis style, includes Alvar Aalto and Erik Bryggman who were both engaged from the very start in the 1930s. The Turku region pioneered this new style and the journal &quot;Arkkitehti&quot; mediated and discussed functionalism in a Finnish context. Many of the first buildings in the funkis style were industrial structures, institutions and offices but spread to other kinds of structures such as residential buildings, individual housing and churches. The functionalist design also spread to interior designs and furniture as exemplified by the iconic Paimio Sanatorium, designed in 1929 and built in 1933.

Aalto introduced standardised, precast concrete elements as early as the late 1920s, when he designed residential buildings in Turku. This technique became a cornerstone of later developments in modernist architecture after World War II, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. He also introduced serial produced wooden housing.

=== Poland ===
Interbellum avant-garde Polish architects in the years 1918–1939 made a notable impact in the legacy of European modern architecture and functionalism. A lot of Polish architects were fascinated by Le Corbusier like his Polish students and coworkers Jerzy Sołtan, Aleksander Kujawski (both co-authors of Unité d&#x27;habitation in Marseille) and his coworkers Helena Syrkus (Le Corbusier&#x27;s companion on board of the S.S. Patris, an ocean liner journeying from Marseille to Athens in 1933 during the CIAM IV), Roman Piotrowski and Maciej Nowicki. Le Corbusier said about Poles (&quot;When the Cathedrals Were White&quot;, Paris 1937) &quot;Academism has sent down roots everywhere. Nevertheless, the Dutch are relatively free of bias. The Czechs believe in &#x27;modern&#x27; and the Polish also.&quot; Other Polish architects like Stanisław Brukalski was meeting with Gerrit Rietveld and inspired by him and his neoplasticism. Only a few years after the construction of Rietveld Schröder House, Polish architect Stanisław Brukalski built his own house in Warsaw in 1929 supposedly inspired by Schröder House he had visited. His Polish example of the modern house was awarded bronze medal in Paris world expo in 1937. Just before the Second World War, it was fashionable to build in Poland a lot of large districts of luxury houses in neighbourhoods full of greenery for wealthy Poles like, for example, district Saska Kępa in Warsaw or district Kamienna Góra in seaport Gdynia. The most characteristic features in Polish functionalist architecture 1918–1939 were portholes, roof terraces and marble interiors.

Probably the most outstanding work of Polish functionalist architecture is the entire city of Gdynia, modern Polish seaport established 1926.

=== Russia ===
In Russia and the former Soviet Union, functionalism was known as Constructivist architecture, and was the dominant style for major building projects between 1918 and 1932. The 1932 competition for the Palace of the Soviets and the winning entry by Boris Iofan marked the start of eclectic historicism of Stalinist Architecture and the end of constructivist domination in Soviet Union.

== Examples ==
Notable representations of functionalist architecture include:

*Södra Ängby, Stockholm, Sweden
*Stanislas Brukalski&#x27;s villa, Warsaw, Poland
*Modernist Center of Gdynia, Poland
*Villa Savoye, Poissy, France

===Södra Ängby, Sweden===

The residential area of Södra Ängby in western Stockholm, Sweden, blended a functionalist or international style with garden city ideals. Encompassing more than 500 buildings, it remains the largest coherent functionalistic villa area in Sweden and possibly the world, still well-preserved more than a half-century after its construction 1933–40 and protected as a national cultural heritage.

===Zlín, Czech Republic===
Zlín is a city in the Czech Republic which was in the 1930s completely reconstructed on principles of functionalism. In that time the city was a headquarters of Bata Shoes company and Tomáš Baťa initiated a complex reconstruction of the city which was inspired by functionalism and the Garden city movement.

Zlín&#x27;s distinctive architecture was guided by principles that were strictly observed during its whole inter-war development. Its central theme was the derivation of all architectural elements from the factory buildings. The central position of the industrial production in the life of all Zlín inhabitants was to be highlighted. Hence the same building materials (red bricks, glass, reinforced concrete) were used for the construction of all public (and most private) edifices. The common structural element of Zlín architecture is a square bay of 20x20 feet (6.15x6.15 m). Although modified by several variations, this high modernist style leads to a high degree of uniformity of all buildings. It highlights the central and unique idea of an industrial garden city at the same time. Architectural and urban functionalism was to serve the demands of a modern city. The simplicity of its buildings which also translated into its functional adaptability was to prescribe (and also react to) the needs of everyday life.

The urban plan of Zlín was the creation of František Lydie Gahura, a student at Le Corbusier&#x27;s atelier in Paris. Architectural highlights of the city are e.g. the Villa of Tomáš Baťa, Baťa&#x27;s Hospital, Tomas Bata Memorial, The Grand Cinema or Baťa&#x27;s Skyscraper.

===Khrushchyovka===

Khrushchyovka () is an unofficial name of type of low-cost, concrete-paneled or brick three- to five-storied apartment building which was developed in the Soviet Union during the early 1960s, during the time its namesake Nikita Khrushchev directed the Soviet government. The apartment buildings also went by the name of &quot;Khruschoba&quot; (, Khrushchev-slum).

==Functionalism in landscape architecture==

The development of functionalism in landscape architecture paralleled its development in building architecture. At the residential scale, designers like Christopher Tunnard, James Rose, and Garrett Eckbo advocated a design philosophy based on the creation of spaces for outdoor living and the integration of house and garden. At a larger scale, the German landscape architect and planner Leberecht Migge advocated the use of edible gardens in social housing projects as a way to counteract hunger and increase self-sufficiency of families. At a still larger scale, the Congrès International d&#x27;Architecture Moderne advocated for urban design strategies based on human proportions and in support of four functions of human settlement: housing, work, play, and transport.

<doc id="568756" wikidata="Q181220" url="?curid=568756" title="Daikundi Province">
<text>Daikundi () is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the central part of the country. It has a population of about 516,504 people, who are mostly peasants, traders, and shop owners.

Daikundi falls into the traditionally ethnic Hazara region known as the Hazarajat in the highlands of central Afghanistan with the provincial capital, Nili. It was carved out from the northern part of Uruzgan Province in 2004, becoming a separate province. 

Daikundi is surrounded by Bamyan Province in the northeast, Ghazni Province in the southeast, Uruzgan Province in the south, Helmand Province in the southwest, and Ghor Province in the northwest.

== Geographic ==

The province of DaiKundi is located in central Afghanistan. The province is bordered on the south by Uruzgan, on the east by Ghazni and Bamiyan, on the north and west by Ghor, and the southeast by Helmand. Until March 2004, Dai Kundi was part of Uruzgan province. The Helmand River separates nearly 90 percent of the steep landscape. 

==History==

Daikundi was established on March 28, 2004, when it was created from the isolated Hazara-dominated northern districts of neighboring Uruzgan Province.

The province maintains its security through the Afghan police and military.

While the Government of Afghanistan, NGOs, the United Nations, and NATO&#x27;s ISAF forces have had little involvement in reconstruction in the province, there have been some initiatives. Following heavy rainfall and flooding in February 2007 the United Nations Assistance Mission for Afghanistan (UNAMA) opened a sub-office in the province and Oxfam, one of the few NGOs operating in the province, described UNAMA&#x27;s input into coordinating flood relief as impressive.

In November 2007 a World Food Programme convoy carrying mixed food aid was forced to abandon its mission due to security concerns and Afghanistan&#x27;s Interior Ministry confirmed that Taliban insurgents had infiltrated the southern district of Kajran in a bid to destabilize the province. On 11 November 2007 Afghan forces launched a military operation to drive out the insurgents.

The United States began building new government institutions in the province. The insurgency problem and shortage of food continued until 2012. Several government officials have warned in October 2012 that &quot;If the government or NGOs (non-governmental organizations) do not address the situation with proper assistance, Daikundi would witness many deaths this winter.&quot; In the meantime, a rebel leader along with his 150 fighters joined the government-initiated peace drive in Nili, capital of Daikundi province.

In July 2018, a bicycle competition was organized in the provincial stadium in Daikundi, between two teams of girls and boys. The bicycle competition was held to promote peace and harmony. There were ten females and ten boys on each of the two teams, and medals, clothing, and other items were given to the winners.

==Demographics==

As of 2020, the total population of Daikundi is estimated to be around 516,504, which is mostly a rural tribal society. The ethnic Hazaras make up the majority of the total population of the province, who speak the Dari and Hazaragi, eastern varieties of Persian.

== Economy ==

The dry weather of Daikundi and its uncertainty of precipitation make farmers concerned about their farm products. They are mostly relying on irrigated land, as they are afraid they do not lose their time, capital, and their labors.

As Daikundi does not have enough rainfall, there is a low capacity for wheat, orchard crops, beans, and vegetable production in cultivation; this makes the household members not have enough required food.

Daikundi people have less access to markets as there is a long distance from rural areas to local markets, poor road networks, snowstorms in the winter, and insecurity. However, people still sell their fruits and nuts to the traders at the farm gates, which get transported to the provincial center and regional markets.

Since the water for irrigation has decreased in Daikundi province, farmers are very concerned about their food production and pasture; even, this has affected farmland leasing. The farmers are not interested to contract lease lands as their crop production is lower and strongly relies on precipitation. Therefore, farmland leasing has decreased in Daikundi province.

The dry weather of Daikundi has not only affected farm production but also has negatively impacted livestock. The fodders and pastures are not enough and sufficient for the animals and they get common diseases like Tuberculosis, PPR (Peste Des Petits Ruminants), Sheep pox, foot and mouth diseases, etc. Even the dairy preservation is very poor in which milk and dairy are not sold in the market, except Kurut.

The only season that dairy products are consumed is during the spring season between April and June. The rest of the year, people in Daikundi do not have access to better nutrition status and try to import dairy products, like yogurt, from other provinces.

Taking care of fruit trees is the most important agricultural part of Daikundi. The most common fruits are almonds, mulberry, and walnuts. The districts of Shahristan, Miramor, and Ishtarlari are the main and major producers of these fruits.

Also, fruit tree plantations, which are mostly apples and almonds, have been increased and supported by NHLP, National Horticulture and Livestock Project.

The Market of Daikundi is pretty functional throughout the year but it has its struggles over the winter season as communications become difficult.

As a result of the above situation, the market and traders in the district centers make enough food stocks at their household level to ensure that there are enough stocks during the winter season.

== Almond festival ==
The first Gole Badam Festival was held in Daikundi 14 years ago. In 2010, the Hazara International Network recommended that this Festival be held to commemorate the blossoming of the almond tree.

Almonds are the province&#x27;s principal agricultural commodity, and many households rely on them for livelihood.

The city&#x27;s Almond Festival, an annual event hosted by the province government, drew nearly 4,000 people from across Daikundi to celebrate.

Almond cultivation is a major contributor to the Daikundi economy.

===Districts===
Daikundi province has 9 districts: Nili, Sangi Takht, Khadir, Gizab, Ishtarlay, Miramor, Shahristan, Kajran, and Kiti.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the main industry of the province. It is well known for its high-quality almonds, which are distributed throughout Afghanistan.

== Climate in Daikundi ==
Daikundi is the most vulnerable province to Climate Change in Afghanistan. The province experiences acute water shortages and droughts have poor soil quality, and risks of avalanches, landslides, and flooding, which cause extensive damage to agricultural land, infrastructure, and food security.

The impacts of climate change in Daikundi are manifold, mostly due to the limited institutional capacity to plan and respond to these impacts.

With support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) are cooperating on pilot field demonstrations in Daikundi province that aim to build environment adaptive and resilience of vulnerable villages to climate change impacts.

The above-mentioned organization also aims to build the capacity of local institutions to address climate change risk within the peri-urban extent of the rapidly developing Nili Town.

== Health ==

The crude death rate was 0.42 (0.25-0.68) (95 percent CI) and the under-five death rate was 0.66 (0.29-1.51) respectively (95 percent CI). Both rates are below the SPHERE emergency levels.

<text>A propfan, also called an open rotor engine, open fan engine or unducted fan (as opposed to a ducted fan), is a type of aircraft engine related in concept to both the turboprop and turbofan, but distinct from both. The design is intended to offer the speed and performance of a turbofan, with the fuel economy of a turboprop. A propfan is typically designed with a large number of short, highly twisted blades, similar to the (ducted) fan in a turbofan engine. For this reason, the propfan has been variously described as an &quot;unducted fan&quot; (UDF) or an &quot;ultra-high-bypass (UHB) turbofan&quot;.

== Definition ==
In the 1970s, Hamilton Standard described its propfan as &quot;a small diameter, highly loaded multiple bladed variable pitch propulsor having swept blades with thin advanced airfoil sections, integrated with a nacelle contoured to retard the airflow through the blades thereby reducing compressibility losses and designed to operate with a turbine engine and using a single stage reduction gear resulting in high performance&quot;. In 1982, the weekly aviation magazine Flight International defined the propfan as a propeller with 8–10 highly swept blades that cruised at a speed of , although its definition evolved a few years later with the emergence of contra-rotating propfans.

In 1986, British engine maker Rolls-Royce used the term &quot;open rotor&quot; as a synonym for the original meaning of a propfan. This action was to delineate the propfan engine type from a number of ducted engine proposals at the time that had &quot;propfan&quot; in their names. By the 2000s, &quot;open rotor&quot; (OR) became a preferred term for propfan technology in research and news reports, with &quot;contra-rotating open rotor&quot; (CROR) also occasionally being used to distinguish between single-rotation propfans. As of 2015, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) defined an open rotor concretely (but broadly) as &quot;a turbine engine fan stage that is not enclosed within a casing&quot;; in contrast, it had only a working definition of an open rotor engine (the more commonly used term for propfan in the 21st century), calling it &quot;a turbine engine featuring contra-rotating fan stages not enclosed within a casing.&quot; The engine uses a gas turbine to drive an unshrouded (open) contra-rotating propeller like a turboprop, but the design of the propeller itself is more tightly coupled to the turbine design, and the two are certified as a single unit.

El-Sayed differentiates between turboprops and propfans according to 11 different criteria, including number of blades, blade shape, tip speed, bypass ratio, Mach number, and cruise altitude.

== History ==

About a decade after German aerospace engineers began exploring the idea of using swept wings to reduce drag on transonic speed aircraft, Hamilton Standard in the 1940s attempted to apply a similar concept to aircraft propellers. It created highly swept propeller blades with supersonic tip speeds, so that engines with exposed propellers could power aircraft to speeds and cruising altitudes only attained by new turbojet and turbofan engines. Early tests of these blades revealed then-unresolvable blade flutter and blade stress problems, and high noise levels were considered another obstacle. The popularity of turbojets and turbofans curtailed research in propellers, but by the 1960s, interest increased when studies showed that an exposed propeller driven by a gas turbine could power an airliner flying at a speed of Mach 0.7–0.8 and at an altitude of . The term propfan was created during this period.

One of the earliest engines that resembled the propfan concept was the Metrovick F.5, which featured twin contra-rotating fans—14 blades in the fore (front) fan and 12 blades in the aft (back) fan—at the rear of the engine and was first run in 1946. The blades, however, were mostly unswept. Other contra-rotating propeller engines that featured on common aircraft included the four powerful Kuznetsov NK-12 engines (each powering its own set of coaxial contra-rotating propellers) on the Soviet Union&#x27;s Tupolev Tu-95 high-speed military bomber and Antonov An-22 military transport aircraft, and the Armstrong Siddeley Double Mamba (ASMD) engines (both connected to a lone set of coaxial contra-rotating propellers) on the British Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft. Both setups had four largely unswept blades in the front propeller and the back propeller.

=== 1970s–1980s ===

When the 1973 oil crisis caused petroleum price spikes in the early 1970s, interest in propfans soared, and NASA-funded research began to accelerate. The propfan concept was outlined by Carl Rohrbach and Bruce Metzger of the Hamilton Standard division of United Technologies in 1975 and was patented by Rohrbach and Robert Cornell of Hamilton Standard in 1979. Later work by General Electric on similar propulsors adopted the name unducted fan, which was a modified turbofan engine, with the fan placed outside the engine nacelle on the same axis as the compressor blades.

During this era, the propeller problems became fixable. Advances were made in structural materials, such as titanium metal and graphite and glass fiber composites infused with resin. These materials replaced aluminum and steel metals in blade construction, which allowed the blades to be made thinner and stronger. Computer-aided design was also useful in refining blade characteristics. Since the blades bend and deflect with higher power loading and centrifugal force, the initial designs needed to be based on the in-motion shape. With the help of computers, the blade designers would then work backward to find the optimal unloaded shape for manufacturing purposes.

==== Flight test programs ====
Hamilton Standard, the only large American manufacturer of aircraft propellers, developed the propfan concept in the early 1970s. Hamilton Standard tested numerous variations in conjunction with NASA.

Under the Propfan Test Assessment (PTA) program, Lockheed-Georgia proposed modifying a Gulfstream II to act as in-flight testbed for the propfan concept, while McDonnell Douglas proposed modifying a DC-9 for the same purpose. NASA chose the Lockheed proposal. The Gulfstream II had a nacelle added to the left wing, containing a Allison 570 turboprop engine (derived from the XT701 turboshaft developed for the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 heavy lift helicopter). The engine used an eight-bladed, , single-rotation Hamilton Standard SR-7 propfan. The test engine, which was named the Allison 501-M78, had a thrust rating of . It was first operated in flight on March 28, 1987. The extensive test program, which cost about $56 million, racked up 73 flights and over 133 hours of flight time before finishing on March 25, 1988. In 1989, however, the testbed aircraft returned to the air from April 3 through April 14 to measure ground noise levels during flight. The engine was removed after that, and the aircraft was converted to a space shuttle training aircraft later that year.
The GE36 Unducted Fan (UDF), from American engine maker General Electric (GE) with 35-percent participation from French partner Snecma (now Safran), was a variation on the original propfan concept and resembled a pusher configuration piston engine. GE&#x27;s UDF had a novel direct-drive arrangement, where the reduction gearbox was replaced by a low-speed seven-stage free turbine. One set of turbine rotors drove the forward set of propellers, while the rear set was driven by the other set of rotors which rotated in the opposite direction. The turbine had 14 blade rows with seven stages. Each stage was a pair of contra-rotating rows. Airframers, who had been wary of issue-prone gearboxes since the 1950s, liked GE&#x27;s gearless version of the propfan: Boeing intended to offer GE&#x27;s pusher UDF engine on the 7J7 platform (which would have had a cruise speed of Mach 0.83), and McDonnell Douglas planned to do likewise on their MD-94X airliner. The GE36 was first flight tested mounted on the #3 engine station of a Boeing 727-100 on August 20, 1986. The GE36 UDF for the 7J7 was planned to have a thrust of , but GE claimed that in general its UDF concept could cover a thrust range of , so a UDF engine could possibly match or surpass the thrust of the CF6, GE&#x27;s family of widebody engines at that time.

McDonnell Douglas developed a proof-of-concept aircraft by modifying its company-owned MD-80, which is suited for propfans due to its aft fuselage-mounted engines (like its DC-9 ancestor), in preparation for the possible propfan-powered MD-91 and MD-92 derivatives and a possible MD-94X clean-sheet aircraft. They replaced the left side JT8D turbofan engine with the GE36. Test flights began in May 1987, which proved the design&#x27;s airworthiness, aerodynamic characteristics, and noise signature. Following the initial tests, a first-class cabin was installed inside the aft fuselage and airline executives were offered the opportunity to experience the UDF-powered aircraft first-hand. The test and marketing flights of the GE-outfitted demonstrator aircraft concluded in 1988, exhibiting a 30% reduction in fuel consumption over turbo-fan powered MD-80, full Stage 3 noise compliance, and low levels of interior noise/vibration. The GE36 would have the same thrust on the MD-92X, but the same engine would be derated to thrust for the smaller MD-91X. The MD-80 was also successfully flight tested in April 1989 with the 578-DX propfan, which was a prototype from the Allison Engine Company (at that time a division of General Motors) that was also derived from the Allison XT701 and built with Hamilton Standard propellers. The engine program was jointly developed between Allison and another division of United Technologies, the engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney. Unlike the competing GE36 UDF, the 578-DX was fairly conventional, having a reduction gearbox between the LP turbine and the propfan blades. Due to jet fuel price drops and shifting marketing priorities, Douglas shelved the propfan program later that year.

==== Other proposed applications ====
Other announcements of future propfan-powered airliners included:
* The Fokker FXX, a 100–120 seat propfan-powered aircraft that was studied in 1982
* The MPC-75, an 80-seat, Mach 0.76 cruise speed, regional aircraft conceived by Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) of West Germany and the Chinese Aero Technology Export/Import Corporation (CATIC); used as the baseline powerplant two direct-drive General Electric GE38-B5 UDF engines delivering in static thrust and cruise with a thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of , respectively, through an diameter propfan with 11 and 9 blades on the contra-rotating propellers; proposed as an alternative powerplant the static thrust, PW–Allison 501-M80E geared propfan engine, which was derived from the 501-M80C turboshaft that was chosen to power the United States Navy&#x27;s Osprey tiltrotor aircraft; later described the propfan engine as one with the core from the T406 (the military designation for the Osprey&#x27;s powerplant), containing a propfan that provided of thrust in cruise with a TSFC of 
* The ATR 92, a , five- or six-abreast, 100-seat aircraft from Avions de Transport Regional (ATR, a joint venture between France&#x27;s Aerospatiale and Italy&#x27;s Aeritalia) and Spain&#x27;s Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA), which would possibly be powered by the UDF
* The Aerospatiale AS.100, a regional aircraft with a range of , a cruise speed of Mach 0.74–0.78 at altitude, and a capacity of 80–100 seats, that might be powered by the UDF or by a propfan version of the Allison T406 tiltrotor engine
* The ATRA-90 (Advanced Technology Regional Aircraft), an 83– to 115–seat aircraft with a range of and a cruise speed of Mach 0.8 at altitude, that was to be built by a multinational joint venture consisting of Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) of Indonesia, Boeing (USA), MBB (West Germany), and Fokker (Netherlands)
* The Tupolev Tu-334, a 126-seat aircraft that can travel with , which is powered by two Progress (also known as Lotarev) D-236 propfans with a specific fuel burn of 0.46 kg/kg-thrust/hour, a cruise thrust of , and a static thrust of 
* The Ilyushin Il-88, a successor to the four-turboprop Antonov An-12 tactical transporter that would be powered by two Progress D-236 propfans
* The Ilyushin Il-118, an upgrade to the four-turboprop Ilyushin Il-18 airliner; proposed in 1984, the aircraft would instead be powered by two D-236 propfans, with the eight-bladed front propeller on each engine rotating at a speed of 1,100 rpm and the six-bladed back propeller turning at 1,000 rpm to lower noise and vibration
* A re-engined Antonov An-124, replacing the four Progress D-18T turbofans by Kuznetsov NK-62 propfans

==== Decline ====

None of these projects came to fruition, however, mainly because of excessive cabin noise (compared to turbofans) and low fuel prices. For General Electric, the GE36 UDF was meant to replace the CFM56 high-bypass turbofan that it produced with equal partner Snecma in their CFM International joint venture. In the 1980s the engine was initially uncompetitive against the International Aero Engines rival offering, the IAE V2500. In December 1986, the chairman of Snecma declared that the in-development CFM56-5S2 would be the last turbofan created for the CFM56 family, and that &quot;&quot;&quot;There is no point in spending more money on turbofans. UDF is the future.&quot; The V2500 ran into technical problems in 1987, however, and the CFM56 gained major sales momentum. General Electric lost interest in having the GE36 cannibalize the CFM56, which went five years before it received its first order in 1979, and while &quot;the UDF could be made reliable by earlier standards, turbofans were getting much, much better than that.&quot; General Electric added the UDF&#x27;s blade technology directly into the GE90, the most powerful jet engine ever produced, for the Boeing 777.

=== 1990s ===

At the beginning of the 1990s, the Soviet Union/Russia performed flight tests on the Progress D-236, a geared contra-rotating propfan engine based on the core of the Progress D-36 turbofan, with eight blades on the front propeller and six blades on the back propeller. One testbed was a propfan mounted to an Ilyushin Il-76 and flown to the Hannover ILA 90 airshow, which was intended for an unidentified four-propfan aircraft. The D-236 flew 36 times for a total of 70 flight test hours on the Il-76. The other testbed was a , mounted to a Yakovlev Yak-42E-LL and flown to the 1991 Paris Air Show, as a demonstration for the planned Yak-46 aircraft with twin propfan engines, which in its base 150-seat version would have a range of and cruise at a speed of (Mach 0.75). The Soviets claimed the D-236 had a true aerodynamic efficiency of 28 percent and a fuel savings of 30 percent over an equivalent turboprop. They also revealed plans for propfans with power ratings of .

Like the Progress D-236, the more powerful Progress D-27 propfan engine is a contra-rotating propfan with eight front blades and six back blades, but the D-27 has advanced composite blades with a reduced thickness-to-chord ratio and a more pronounced curvature at the leading edge. An engine that was launched in 1985, the D-27 delivers of power with of thrust at takeoff. Two rear-mounted D-27 propfans propelled the Ukrainian Antonov An-180, which was scheduled for a 1995 first flight and a 1997 entry into service. In January 1994, Antonov rolled out the first prototype of the An-70 military transport aircraft, powered by four Progress D-27s attached to wings mounted to the top of the fuselage. The Russian Air Force placed an order for 164 aircraft in 2003, later canceled. As of 2013, the An-70 was still thought to have a promising future as a freighter. Since the propeller component of the Progress D-27 is made by Russia&#x27;s SPE Aerosila, however, the An-70 was stymied by the Russo-Ukrainian War. Antonov began working instead with Turkey in 2018 to redevelop the An-70 as a rebranded An-77, so that the aircraft can comply with modern-day requirements without Russian supplier participation.

=== Twenty-first century ===
In the first decade of the 21st century, rising jet fuel prices increased emphasis on engine/airframe efficiency to reduce emissions, which renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners beyond the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350XWB. For instance, Airbus patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted contra-rotating propfans. Rolls-Royce had the rear (pusher) configured RB.509-11 and front (tractor) configured RB.509-14 geared propfan designs, which produced using the gas generator from its XG-40 engine with of shaft power. It became lukewarm on propfan technology in the 1980salthough it developed an open rotor design that was thought to be a finalist for the Irkut MS-21 narrowbody aircraft. The Rolls-Royce RB3011 engine would have a diameter of about and require a gearbox.

The European Commission launched an Open Rotor demonstration in 2008 led by Safran within the Clean Sky program funded with €65 million over eight years. A demonstrator was assembled in 2015, and ground tested in May 2017 on its open-air test rig in Istres, aiming to reduce fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions by 30% compared with current CFM56 turbofans. After the completion of ground testing at the end of 2017, Safran&#x27;s geared open rotor engine had reached technology readiness level 5. The demonstrator&#x27;s twelve-blade front propeller and ten-blade back propeller had diameters of , respectively. The demonstrator, based on the core of the Snecma M88 military fighter engine, uses up to , provides a thrust of about , and would cruise at a speed of Mach 0.75. Safran&#x27;s future open rotor engine, however, would have a maximum diameter of almost .

In 2007, the Progress D-27 was successfully modified to meet the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Stage 4 regulations, which correspond to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Chapter 4 standards. A 2012 trade study projected that propfan noise would be 10–13 decibels quieter than allowed by Stage 4 regulations. Stage 5 noise limits reduce the limits by only seven effective perceived noise decibels (EPNdB), within the propfan noise envelope. The study also projected that open rotors would be nine percent more fuel-efficient but remain 10–12 decibels louder than turbofans. Snecma claimed that its propfan engines would have about the same noise levels as its CFM LEAP turbofan engine.

In 2021, CFM International announced its Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) development program to produce a single-stage, gear-driven propfan paired with active stators in a puller/tractor, configuration with flight tests to begin by 2025. The rotor was expected to be in diameter. The engine was expected to produce of thrust, with a 20% increase in fuel efficiency. The company claimed its motivation was the global emphasis on reducing emissions. The engine was planned to support both hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels. The engine was expected to include a compact high-pressure core and a recuperating system to preheat combustion air with exhaust heat along with ceramic matrix composites in the hot section and resin-transfer-molded composite fan blades. In addition to the rotor, the design includes a nonrotating set of variable-pitch stator blades that act as flow recovery vanes. The design increases the fan-pressure ratio and reduces rotor loading, increasing airspeed. The fan stage is to be powered by a high-speed booster compressor and a high-speed, low-pressure-shaft-driven front gearbox. The engine is slated for certification as an &quot;integrated engine&quot; instead of a traditional &quot;propeller/engine&quot; because of its airframe integration complexity. CFM planned for an aerodynamically three-dimensional rotor with 12 woven carbon-fiber composite blades. Aided by a smaller engine core, the CFM RISE engine would have a bypass ratio of 75.

== Challenges ==

=== Blade design ===
Turboprops have an optimum speed below about , because propellers lose efficiency at high speed, due to an effect known as wave drag that occurs just below supersonic speeds. This powerful drag has a sudden onset, and it led to the concept of a sound barrier when first encountered in the 1940s. This effect can happen whenever the propeller is spun fast enough that the blade tips approach the speed of sound.

The most effective way to address this problem is by adding blades to the propeller, allowing it to deliver more power at a lower rotational speed. This is why many World War II fighter designs started with two or three-blade propellers but by the end of the war were using up to five blades; as the engines were upgraded, new propellers were needed to more efficiently convert that power. Adding blades makes the propeller harder to balance and maintain, and the additional blades cause minor performance penalties due to drag and efficiency issues. But even with these sorts of measures, eventually the forward speed of the plane combined with the rotational speed of the propeller blade tips (together known as the helical tip speed) will again result in wave drag problems. For most aircraft, this will occur at speeds over about .

A method of decreasing wave drag was discovered by German researchers in 1935—sweeping the wing backwards. Today, almost all aircraft designed to fly much above use a swept wing. Since the inside of the propeller is moving slower in the rotational direction than the outside, the blade is progressively more swept back toward the outside, leading to a curved shape similar to a scimitar – a practice that was first used as far back as 1909, in the Chauvière two-bladed wood propeller used on the Blériot XI. (At the blade root, the blade is actually swept forward into the rotational direction, to counter the twisting that is generated by the backward swept blade tips.) The Hamilton Standard test propfan was swept progressively to a 39-degree maximum at the blade tips, allowing the propfan to produce thrust even though the blades had a helical tip speed of about Mach 1.15.

The blades of the GE36 UDF and the 578-DX have a maximum tip speed in rotation of about , or about half the maximum tip speed for the propeller blades of a conventional turbofan. That maximum blade tip speed would be kept constant despite wider or narrower propeller diameter (resulting in an RPM reduction or increase, respectively).

Drag can also be reduced by making the blades thinner, which increases the speed that the blades can attain before the air ahead of them becomes compressible and causes shock waves. For example, the blades of the Hamilton Standard test propfan had a thickness-to-chord ratio that tapered from less than 20% at the spinner junction to 2% at the tips, and 4% at mid-span. Propfan blades had approximately half the thickness-to-chord ratio of the best conventional propeller blades of the era, thinned to razor-like sharpness at their edges, and weighed as little as . (The GE36 UDF engine that was tested on the Boeing 727 had front and back blades that weighed each.)

=== Noise ===

One of the major problems with the propfan is noise. The propfan research in the 1980s discovered ways to reduce noise, but at the cost of reduced fuel efficiency, mitigating some of the advantages of a propfan.

General methods for reducing noise include lowering tip speeds and decreasing blade loading, or the amount of thrust per unit of blade surface area. A concept similar to wing loading, blade loading can be reduced by lowering the thrust requirement or by increasing the amount, width, and/or length of the blades. For contra-rotating propfans, which can be louder than turboprops or single-rotating propfans, noise can also be lowered by:
* increasing the gap between the propellers;
* keeping back propeller blade lengths shorter than those of the front propeller, so that the back propeller blades avoid cutting through the blade tip vortices of the front propeller (blade-vortex interaction);
* using different numbers of blades on the two propellers, to avoid acoustic reinforcement; and
* turning the front propeller and back propeller at different speeds, also to prevent acoustic reinforcement.

==== Community noise ====

Engine makers expect propfan implementations to meet community (as opposed to cabin) noise regulations without sacrificing the efficiency advantage. Some think that propfans can potentially cause less of a community impact than turbofans, given their lower rotational speeds. Geared propfans should have an advantage over ungeared propfans for the same reason.

In 2007, the Progress D-27 was modified to meet the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Stage 4 regulations, which correspond to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Chapter 4 standards and were adopted in 2006. A 2012 trade study by NASA projected that noise from existing open rotor technology would be 10–13 cumulative EPNdB quieter than the maximum noise level allowed by the Stage 4 regulations. The newer Stage 5 noise limits (which replaced the Stage 4 regulations for larger aircraft in 2018 and mirrored the ICAO Chapter 14 noise standard established in 2014) are more restrictive than the Stage 4 requirement by only seven cumulative EPNdB, so current propfan technology shouldn&#x27;t be hindered by the Stage 5 standards. (The term “cumulative” is used to combine takeoff lateral, takeoff flyover and approach EPNdB margins relative to certification noise levels). The study also projected that at existing technology levels, open rotors would be nine percent more fuel-efficient but remain 10–12 cumulative EPNdB louder than future aircraft with advanced ultra-high bypass ratio turbofans. Snecma estimates from open-rotor tests that its propfan engines would have about the same noise levels as its CFM LEAP turbofan engine, which entered service in 2016.

Further reductions can be achieved by redesigning the aircraft structure to shield noise from the ground. For example, another study estimated that if propfan engines were used to power a hybrid wing body aircraft instead of a conventional tube-and-wing aircraft, noise levels could be reduced by as much as 38 cumulative EPNdB compared to ICAO Chapter 4 requirements. In 2007, the British budget airline easyJet introduced its ecoJet concept, a 150–250 seat aircraft with V-mounted open rotor engines joined to the rear fuselage and shielded by a U-tail. It unsuccessfully initiated discussions with Airbus, Boeing, and Rolls-Royce to produce the aircraft.

=== Size ===

A twin-engine aircraft carrying 100–150 passengers would require propfan diameters of , and a propfan with a propeller diameter of would theoretically produce almost of thrust. These sizes achieve the desired high bypass ratios of over 30, but they are approximately twice the diameter of turbofan engines of equivalent capability. For this reason, airframers usually design the empennage with a T-tail configuration in order to avoid the turbulent propwash adversely influencing the elevators and causing vibration issues therein. The propfans may be attached to the upper part of the rear fuselage. For the Rolls-Royce RB3011 propfan prototype, a pylon of about long would be required to connect the center of each engine to the side of the fuselage. If the propfans are mounted to the wings, the wings would be attached to the aircraft in a high wing configuration, which allows for ground clearance without requiring excessively long landing gear. For the same amount of power or thrust produced, an unducted fan requires shorter blades than a geared propfan, although the overall installation issues still apply.

=== Output rating ===

Turboprops and most propfans are rated by the amount of shaft horsepower (shp) that they produce, as opposed to turbofans and the UDF propfan type, which are rated by the amount of thrust they put out. The rule of thumb is that at sea level with a static engine, is roughly equivalent of thrust, but at cruise altitude, that changes to about thrust. That means two engines can theoretically be replaced with a pair of propfans or with two UDF propfans.

<text>George P. Livanos (9 July 1926 – 1 June 1997) was a Greek shipping magnate born in New Orleans, the son of Peter Livanos from Chios. He is sometimes confused with his cousin, George S. Livanos, the sole son of Stavros G. Livanos, a legend in Greek shipping.

After the end of World War II, Livanos served in the Transportation Corps of the United States Army, first in Japan and then in Korea, where he was a sea captain in Army ships carrying cargo. 

After earning a degree in Economics from the University of Athens, he founded his own company, Ceres Hellenic Shipping Enterprises, in 1949. Shortly after, he inherited his father&#x27;s 30-ship fleet, which included the world&#x27;s five largest supertankers.

Livanos managed his business from Lausanne. With over 100 ships, his fleet was the largest merchant navy in Greece. He also created a shipping company, which pioneered fast ferry services between the Greek Islands, introducing coastal passenger hydrofoils on an extensive network of routes linking the mainland with nearby islands. For two decades, the services operated under the Ceres Flying Dolphins&#x27; brand name, became a household expression in Greece. Loyalty to his Greek roots prompted Livanos to shun flags of convenience for his vessels, despite the enormous tax advantages that this would have meant. Instead his ships invariably flew the Greek flag.

Diversifying in latter years, he invested in real estate, and in banking with Basil Goulandris, another Lausanne-based Greek shipowner. In 1994, Livanos&#x27; fortune was an estimated US$3 billion. He was ahead of his time, as he had begun to heed warnings that abuse of the environment could destroy the planet and was involved in the protection of ocean and coastal waters. He founded the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Association (HELMEPA) in 1982.

Livanos was an influential member of the Greek lobby in Washington. In 1988, he threw his backing behind the Presidential bid of the Democratic candidate and fellow Greek American, Michael Dukakis. He was also a close personal friend of long-serving Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.

Livanos married Fotini Carras, the daughter of the Greek shipowner Yiannis Carras, and had a son, Peter, and a daughter, Marina. He died in 1997, leaving his business to his son.

<doc id="568770" wikidata="Q33090" url="?curid=568770" title="Cariban languages">
<text>The Cariban languages are a family of languages indigenous to north-eastern South America. They are widespread across northernmost South America, from the mouth of the Amazon River to the Colombian Andes, and they are also spoken in small pockets of central Brazil. The languages of the Cariban family are relatively closely related. There are about three dozen, but most are spoken only by a few hundred people. Macushi is the only language among them with numerous speakers, estimated at 30,000. The Cariban family is well known among linguists partly because one language in the family—Hixkaryana—has a default word order of object–verb–subject. Prior to their discovery of this, linguists believed that this order did not exist in any spoken natural language.

In the 16th century, Cariban peoples expanded into the Lesser Antilles. There they killed or displaced, and also mixed with the Arawak peoples who already inhabited the islands. The resulting language—Kalhíphona or Island Carib—was Carib in name but largely Arawak in substance. The Carib male conquerors took Arawak women as wives, and the latter passed on their own language on to the children. For a time, Arawak was spoken by women and children and Carib by adult men, but as each generation of Carib-Arawak boys reached adulthood, they acquired less Carib until only basic vocabulary and a few grammatical elements were left. That form of Island Carib became extinct in the Lesser Antilles in the 1920s, but it survives as Garífuna, or &quot;Black Carib,&quot; in Central America. The gender distinction has dwindled to only a handful of words. Dominica is the only island in the eastern Caribbean to retain some of its pre-Columbian population, descendants of the Carib Indians, about 3,000 of whom live on the island&#x27;s east coast.

==Genetic relations==
The Cariban languages share irregular morphology with the Jê and Tupian families. Ribeiro connects them all in a Je–Tupi–Carib family. Meira, Gildea, &amp; Hoff (2010) note that likely morphemes in proto-Tupian and proto-Cariban are good candidates for being cognates, but that work so far is insufficient to make definitive statements.

==Language contact==
Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Guato, Kawapana, Nambikwara, Taruma, Warao, Arawak, Bororo, Jeoromitxi, Karaja, Rikbaktsa, and Tupi language families due to contact.

Extensive lexical similarities between Cariban and various Macro-Jê languages suggest that Cariban languages had originated in the Lower Amazon region (rather than in the Guiana Highlands). There they were in contact with early forms of Macro-Jê languages, which were likely spoken in an area between the Parecis Plateau and upper Araguaia River.

==Family division==
The Cariban languages are closely related. In many cases where one of the languages is more distinct, this is due to influence from neighboring languages rather than an indication that it is not closely related. According to Kaufman (2007), &quot;Except for Opon, Yukpa, Pimenteira and Palmela (and possibly Panare), the Cariban languages are not very diverse phonologically and lexically (though more so than Romance, for example).&quot;

===Previous classifications===
Good data has been collected around ca. 2000 on most Cariban languages; classifications prior to that time (including Kaufman 2007, which relies on the earlier work) are unreliable. 

Several such classifications have been published; the one shown here, by Derbyshire (1999) divides Cariban into seven branches. A traditional geographic classification into northern and southern branches is cross referenced with (N) or (S) after each language.
*Cariban
**Galibi [Kaliña] (N)
**Guiana Carib (Taranoan): 
***Trio: Tiriyó–Akuriyó , Salumá (N), Carijona–Hianákoto (S)
***Kashuyana: Sikiana (N), Kaxuiâna [Warikyana] (S)
***Waiwai: Hixkaryána (S), Waiwai (N)
***:Kaufman breaks this up into its constituent branches
**North Amazonian Carib:
***Yawaperi: Atruahí [Atrowari, Waimiri] (N)
***Pemong: Macushi–Pemon [Arekuna], Akawaio–Patamona (= Kapong, Ingariko) (N)
***Paravilyana: Pawishiana 
***:Kaufman breaks this up into its constituent branches, adding Purukotó to Pemong; Boanarí to Atruahí; Paravilyana and Sapará to Pawishiana
**Central Carib:
***Wayana–Apalaí (N)
***Maquiritari [Dekwana] (S)
***Mapoyo–Yabarana–Pémono (N)
***:Kaufman adds Chaima [Kumaná]; Arakajú (to Wayana); Yao and Tiverikoto ; Wajumará (to Makiritare)
***:Tamanaku is close to Mapoyo
**South Amazonian Carib:
***Bakairi: Bakairí, Kuikúro [Kalapálo, Amonap], Matipuhy [Nahukwa] (S)
***Arara: Txikão [Ikpeng, Chikaon], Arára [Pará] (N)
***:To Arara Kaufman adds extinct Juma , Apiaká-Apingi , Yarumá 
**Yukpa:
***Japrería (N)
***Yukpa (N)
***Coyaima (N) 
**Panare (N)
**Opon [Opón-Karare] 
*Unclassified:
**Pimenteira 
**Palmela 
The extinct Patagón de Perico language of northern Peru also appears to have been a Cariban language, perhaps close to Carijona. Yao is so poorly attested that Gildea believes it may never be classified.

===Meira (2006)===
Preliminary internal classification of the Cariban languages according to Sérgio Meira (2006):
*Cariban
**Guianan branch
***Karinya (Galibi); Wayana; Apalaí (?); Palmella (?)
***&quot;Taranoan&quot; group
****Karihona
****Tiriyó; Akuriyó
***&quot;Parukotoan&quot; group
****Katxuyana
****Waiwai; Hixkaryana
**Venezolano branch
***&quot;Coastal&quot; group
***Tamanaku 
****Chayma 
****Cumanagoto 
***&quot;Pemongan&quot; group
****Pemong (Arekuna, etc.)
****Kapong (Akawaio, etc.)
****Makuxi
***Panare
***Ye’kwana (?)
***Mapoyo (?); Yawarana (?)
**Waimirian branch
***Waimiri-Atroari (?)
**Yukpano branch
***Yukpa (Motilón)
***Hapreria (Japreria)
**Southern (or Pekodian) branch
***Bakairi
***&quot;Xinguan&quot; group (or &quot;Kampot dialect cluster&quot;)
****Arára
****Ikpeng
****Apiaká do Tocantins
****Parirí
****Yarumá
**Kuikuroan branch
***Kuikuro (Kalapalo, etc.)
***Pimenteira (?)
===Gildea (2012)===
As of Gildea (2012), there had not yet been time to fully reclassify the Cariban languages based on the new data. The list here is therefore tentative, though an improvement over the one above; the most secure branches are listed first, and only two of the extinct languages are addressed.
*Cariban
**Parukotoan
***Katxúyana (Shikuyana, Warikyana)
***Waiwai: Waiwai (Wabui, Tunayana), Hixkaryana
**Pekodian
***Bakairí
***Arara: Arara (Parirí), Ikpéng (Txikão)
**Venezuelan Carib
***Pemóng–Panare
****Pemóng: Kapóng (Akawaio, Patamuna, Ingarikó), Makushi, Pemón (Taurepang, Kamarakóto, Arekuna)
****Panare
***Mapoyo–Tamanaku
**** Kumaná (Chaima, Cumanagota, Tamanaku)
****Mapoyo-Yawarana (Mapoyo, Wanai, Yawarana, Pémono)
**Nahukwa: Kuikúro, Kalapalo
**Guianan Carib
***Kari&#x27;nja (Carib, Kalinya, Cariña, Galibi)
***Makiritare (De&#x27;kwana, Maiongong, Ye&#x27;kwana)

****Tiriyo: Akuriyo, Tiriyo, Trio
****Karihona
***Wayana
*Unclassified:
**Apalaí
**Waimirí Atroarí
**Yukpa: Yukpa, Japréria
===Meira et al. (2015)===
Meira, Birchall &amp; Chousou-Polydouri (2015) give the following phylogenetic tree of Cariban, based on a computational phylogenetic analysis of 100-item Swadesh lists.
*Cariban
**Opon-Carare
**Yukpa
**Nuclear Cariban
***Sapara
***Pekodian
****Bakairi
****Arara, Ikpeng
***Kuhikugu
***Pemongan
****Pemon
****Taurepang
****Makushi
****Patamuna; Akawaio, Arekuna
***Wayumaran
****Wayumara
****Purukoto
***Parukotoan
****Katxuyana
****Hixkaryana, Waiwai
***Kumanan
****Chayma
****Cumanagoto
***Tamanaku
***Mapoyan
****Yawarana
****Pemono, Mapoyo
***Panare
***Dekwana
***Guianan
****Wayana, Apalai
****Taranoan
*****Karihona
*****Tiriyo, Akuriyo
***Karina
***Waimiri
Meira, Birchall &amp; Chousou-Polydouri (2015) conclude that the Proto-Cariban homeland was located north of the Amazon River, and that there is no evidence for a northward migration from the south, as previously proposed by Rodrigues (1985). Rather there were two southern migrations (Pekodian and Nahukwa into the Upper Xingu).

<text>The Apocalypse of Peter, also called the Revelation of Peter, is an early Christian text of the 2nd century and a work of apocalyptic literature. It is the earliest-written extant work depicting a Christian account of heaven and hell in detail. The Apocalypse of Peter is influenced by both Jewish apocalyptic literature and Greek philosophy of the Hellenistic period. The text is extant in two diverging versions based on a lost Koine Greek original: a shorter Greek version and a longer Ethiopic version.

The work is pseudepigraphal: it is purportedly written by the disciple Peter, but its actual author is unknown. The Apocalypse of Peter describes a divine vision experienced by Peter through the risen Jesus Christ. After the disciples inquire about signs of the Second Coming of Jesus, the work delves into a vision of the afterlife (), and details both heavenly bliss for the righteous and infernal punishments for the damned. In particular, the punishments are graphically described in a physical sense, and loosely correspond to &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; (): blasphemers are hung by their tongues; liars who bear false witness have their lips cut off; callous rich people are pierced by stones while being made to go barefoot and wear filthy rags, mirroring the status of the poor in life; and so on.

The Apocalypse of Peter is not included in the standard canon of the New Testament, but is classed as part of New Testament apocrypha. It is listed in the canon of the Muratorian fragment, a 2nd-century list of approved books in Christianity and one of the earliest surviving proto-canons. However, the Muratorian fragment expresses some hesitation on the work, saying that some authorities would not have it read in church. While the Apocalypse of Peter influenced other Christian works in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th centuries, it came to be considered inauthentic and declined in use. It was largely superseded by the Apocalypse of Paul, a popular 4th-century work heavily influenced by the Apocalypse of Peter that provides its own updated vision of heaven and hell. The Apocalypse of Peter is a forerunner of the same genre as the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante, wherein the protagonist takes a tour of the realms of the afterlife.

==Authorship and date==
The Apocalypse of Peter seems to have been written between 100 AD and 150 AD. The —the point after which the Apocalypse of Peter must have been written—is shown by its probable use of the Fourth Book of Esdras, which was written about 100 AD. The Apocalypse is quoted in Book 2 of the Sibylline Oracles (), and cited by name and quoted in Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Prophetical Extracts&quot; (). It also appears by name in the Muratorian fragment, generally dated to the late 2nd century (). All of this implies it must have been in existence by around 150 AD, the (the date before which it must have been written).

The geographic origin of the author is unknown and remains a matter of scholarly debate. The main theories are for Palestine or Egypt. Richard Bauckham argues for more precisely dating the composition to the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136), and identifies the author as a Jewish Christian in Roman Judea, the region affected by the revolt. As an example, the writer seems to write from a position of persecution, condemning those who caused the deaths of martyrs by their lies, and Bar Kokhba is reputed to have punished and killed Christians. This suggestion is not accepted by all; Eibert Tigchelaar wrote a rebuttal of the argument as unconvincing, as other calamities such as the Jewish revolt under Trajan (115–117) could have been the inspiration, as could forgotten local persecutions. Other scholars suggest Roman Egypt as a possible origin; Jan Bremmer suggests that Greek philosophical influence in the work points to an author or editor in more Hellenized Egypt, although perhaps working off a Palestinian text.

==Manuscript history==
From the medieval era to 1886, the Apocalypse of Peter was known only through quotations and mentions in early Christian writings. A fragmented Koine Greek manuscript was discovered during excavations initiated by Gaston Maspéro during the 1886–87 season in a desert necropolis at Akhmim in Upper Egypt. The fragment consisted of parchment leaves supposedly deposited in the grave of a Christian monk. There are a wide range of estimates for when the manuscript was written. Paleographer Guglielmo Cavallo and papyrologist Herwig Maehler estimate that the late 6th century is the most likely. The Greek manuscript is now kept in the Coptic Museum in Old Cairo.

The French explorer Antoine d&#x27;Abbadie acquired a large number of manuscripts in Ethiopia in the 19th century, but many sat unanalyzed and untranslated for decades. A large set of Clementine literature in Ethiopic from d&#x27;Abbadie&#x27;s collection was published along with translations into French in 1907–1910. After reading the French translations, the English scholar M. R. James realized in 1910 that there was a strong correspondence with the Akhmim Greek Apocalypse of Peter, and that an Ethiopic version of the same work was within this cache. Another independent Ethiopic manuscript was discovered on the island of Kebrān in Lake Tana in 1968. Scholars speculate that these Ethiopic versions were translated from a lost Arabic version, which itself was translated from the lost Greek original. The d&#x27;Abbadie manuscript is estimated by Carlo Conti Rossini to have been created in the 15th or 16th century, while the Lake Tana manuscript is estimated by Ernst Hammerschmidt to be from perhaps the 18th century.

Two other short Greek fragments of the work have been discovered, both originally found in Egypt: a 5th-century fragment held by the Bodleian library in Oxford that had been discovered in 1895; and the Rainer fragment held by the Rainer collection in Vienna, discovered in the 1880s but only recognized as relevant to the Apocalypse of Peter in 1929. The Rainer fragment was dated to the 3rd or 4th century by M. R. James in 1931. A 2003 analysis suggests it is from the same manuscript as the Bodleian fragment and thus also from the 5th century. These fragments offer significant variations from the other versions. In the Ethiopic manuscripts, the Apocalypse of Peter is only one section of a combined work called &quot;The Second Coming of Christ and the Resurrection of the Dead&quot;, followed in both manuscripts by a work called &quot;The Mystery of the Judgment of Sinners&quot;. In total, five manuscripts are extant today: the two Ethiopic manuscripts and the three Greek fragments.

Most scholars believe that the Ethiopic versions are closer to the original text, while the Greek manuscript discovered at Akhmim is a later and edited version. This is for a number of reasons: the Akhmim version is shorter, while the Ethiopic matches the claimed line count from the Stichometry of Nicephorus; patristic references and quotes seem to match the Ethiopic version better; the Ethiopic matches better with the Rainer and Bodleian Greek fragments; and the Akhmim version seems to be attempting to integrate the Apocalypse with the Gospel of Peter (also in the Akhmim manuscript), which would naturally result in revisions. The Rainer and Bodleian fragments can be compared to the others in only a few passages, but are considered to be the most reliable guide to the original text.

==Contents==
The Apocalypse of Peter is framed as a discourse of Jesus to his faithful. In the Ethiopic version, the apostle Peter experiences a vision of hell followed by a vision of heaven, granted by the risen Christ; in the Akhmim fragment, the order of heaven and hell is reversed, and it is revealed by Jesus during his life and ministry. In the form of a Greek or , it goes into elaborate detail about the punishment in hell for each type of crime, as well as briefly sketching the nature of heaven.

===The Second Coming===
In the opening, the disciples ask for signs of the Second Coming () while on the Mount of Olives. In chapter 2 of the Ethiopic version, Peter asks for an explanation of the meaning of the parables of the budding fig tree and the barren fig tree, in an expansion of the &quot;Little Apocalypse&quot; of Matthew 24. Jesus joins the two parables in a detailed allegory. The setting &quot;in the summer&quot; is transferred to &quot;the end of the world&quot;; the fig tree represents Israel, and the flourishing shoots are Jews who have adopted Jesus as Messiah and achieve martyrdom. The work continues on to describe the end times that will accompany the Second Coming: fire and darkness will convulse the world, a crowned Christ will return in glory, and the people of the nations will pass through a river of fire. The elect will be unscathed by the test, but sinners will be brought to a place where they shall be punished for their transgressions.

===Punishments and rewards===
The work proceeds to describe the punishments that await the wicked. Many of the punishments are overseen by Ezrael the Angel of Wrath (most likely the angel Azrael, although possibly a corrupt reference to the angel Sariel). The angel Uriel resurrects the dead into new bodies so that they can be either rewarded or tormented physically. Punishments in hell according to the vision include:
The vision of heaven is shorter than the depiction of hell, and described more fully in the Akhmim version. In heaven, people have pure milky white skin, curly hair, and are generally beautiful. The earth blooms with everlasting flowers and spices. People wear shiny clothes made of light, like the angels. Everyone sings in choral prayer.

In the Ethiopic version, the account closes with an account of the ascension of Jesus on the mountain in chapters 15–17. Jesus, accompanied by the prophets Moses and Elijah, ascends on a cloud to the first heaven, and then they depart to the second heaven. While it is an account of the ascension, it includes some parallels to Matthew&#x27;s account of the transfiguration of Jesus. In the Akhmim fragment, which is set when Jesus was still alive, both the mountain and the two other men are unnamed (rather than being Moses and Elijah), but the men are similarly transfigured into radiant forms.

===Prayers for those in hell===

One theological issue appears only in the version of the text in the Rainer fragment. Its chapter 14 describes the salvation of condemned sinners for whom the righteous pray:

While not found in later manuscripts, this reading was likely original to the text, as it agrees with a quotation in the Sibylline Oracles:

Other pieces of Christian literature with parallel passages probably influenced by this include the Epistle of the Apostles and the Coptic Apocalypse of Elijah. The passage also makes literary sense, as it is a follow-up to a passage in chapter 3 where Jesus initially rebukes Peter who expresses horror at the suffering in hell; Richard Bauckham suggests that this is because it must be the victims who were harmed that request mercy, not Peter. While not directly endorsing universal salvation, it does suggest that salvation will eventually reach as far as the compassion of the elect.

The Ethiopic manuscript maintains a version of the passage, but it differs in that it is the elect and righteous who receive baptism and salvation in a field rather than a lake (&quot;field of Akerosya, which is called Aneslasleya&quot; in Ethiopic), perhaps conflating Acherusia with the Elysian field. The Ethiopic version of the list of punishments in hell includes sentences not in the Akhmim fragment saying that the punishment is eternal—hypothesized by many scholars to be later additions. Despite this, the other Clementine works in the Ethiopic manuscripts discuss a great act of divine mercy to come that must be kept secret, yet will rescue some or all sinners from hell, suggesting this belief had not entirely fallen away.

==Influences, genre, and related works==

As the title suggests, the Apocalypse of Peter is classed as part of the genre of apocalyptic literature. The Greek word literally means &quot;revelation&quot;, and apocalypses typically feature a revelation of otherworldly secrets from a divine being to a human—in the case of this work, Jesus and Peter. Like many other apocalypses, the work is pseudepigraphal: it claims the authorship of a famous figure to bolster the authority of its message. The Apocalypse of Peter is one of the earliest examples of a Christian , a genre of explicit depictions of the realms and fates of the dead.

===Predecessors===
Much of the early scholarship on the Apocalypse was spent on efforts to determine its predecessor influences. The first studies generally emphasized its roots in Hellenistic philosophy and thought. , a work by Albrecht Dieterich published in 1893 on the basis of the Akhmim manuscript alone, identified parallels and links with the Orphic religious tradition and Greek cultural context. Plato&#x27;s is often held up as an example of the Greek beliefs on the nature of the afterlife that influenced the Apocalypse of Peter. Scholarship in the late 20th century by Martha Himmelfarb and others emphasizes the strong Jewish roots of the Apocalypse of Peter as well. Apocalypses were a popular genre among Jews in the era of Greek and then Roman rule. Much of the Apocalypse of Peter may be based on or influenced by these lost Jewish apocalypses, works such as the &quot;Book of the Watchers&quot; (chapters 1–36 of the Book of Enoch), and 1st–2nd-century Jewish thought in general. The work probably cites the Jewish apocalyptic work 4 Esdras. The author also appears to be familiar with the Gospel of Matthew but no other gospels; a line in chapter 16 has Peter realizing the meaning of the Beatitude quote that &quot;Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness&#x27;s sake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven.&quot;

The Apocalypse of Peter seems to quote from Ezekiel 37, the story of the Valley of Dry Bones. During its rendition of the ascension of Jesus, it also quotes from Psalm 24, which was considered as a messianic psalm foretelling the coming of Jesus and Christianity in the early church. The psalm is given an interpretation as a prophecy of Jesus&#x27;s entry into heaven.

The post-mortem baptism in the Acherousian lake was likely influenced by the Jewish cultural practice of washing the dead before the corpse is buried, a practice shared by early Christians. There was a linkage or analogy between cleansing the soul on death as well as cleaning the body, as the Apocalypse of Peter passage essentially combines the two.

While much work has been done on predecessor influences, Eric Beck stresses that much of the Apocalypse of Peter is distinct among extant literature of the period, and may well have been unique at the time, rather than simply adapting lost earlier writings. As an example, earlier Jewish literature varied in its depictions of Sheol, the underworld, but did not usually threaten active torment to the wicked. Instead eternal destruction was the more frequent threat in these early works, a possibility that does not arise in the Apocalypse of Peter.

===Contemporary work===
In the beginning of the book, Jesus, who had been resurrected, is giving further insights to the Apostles. This is followed by an account of Jesus&#x27;s ascension. This appears to have been a popular setting in 2nd century Christian works, with the dialogue generally taking place on a mountain, as in the Apocalypse of Peter. The genre is sometimes called a &quot;dialogue Gospel&quot;, and is seen in works such as the Epistle of the Apostles, the Questions of Bartholomew, and various Gnostic works such as the .

Among writings that were eventually canonized in the New Testament, the Apocalypse of Peter shows a close resemblance in ideas with the epistle 2 Peter, to the extent that many scholars believe one had copied passages from the other due to the number of close parallels. While both the Apocalypse of Peter and the Apocalypse of John (the Book of Revelation) are apocalypses in genre, the Revelation of Peter puts far more stress on the afterlife and divine rewards and punishments, while the Revelation of John focuses on a cosmic battle between good and evil.

===Later influence===

The Apocalypse of Peter is the earliest surviving detailed depiction of heaven and hell in a Christian context. These depictions appear to have been quite influential to later works, although how much of this is due to the Apocalypse of Peter itself and how much to lost similar literature is unclear.

The Sibylline Oracles, popular among Roman Christians, directly quotes the Apocalypse of Peter. Macarius Magnes&#x27;s , a 3rd-century Christian apologetic work, features &quot;a pagan philosopher&quot; who quotes the Apocalypse of Peter, albeit in an attempt to disprove Christianity. The visions narrated in the Acts of Thomas, another 3rd-century work, also appear to quote or reference the Apocalypse of Peter. The bishop Methodius of Olympus appears to positively quote the Apocalypse of Peter in the 4th century, although it is uncertain whether he regarded it as scripture.

The Apocalypse of Peter is a predecessor of and has similarities with the genre of Clementine literature that would later be popular in Alexandria, although Clement himself does not appear in the Apocalypse of Peter. Clementine stories usually involved Peter and Clement of Rome having adventures, revelations, and dialogues together. Both Ethiopic manuscripts that include the Apocalypse of Peter are mixed in with other Ethiopic Clementine literature that feature Peter prominently. Clementine literature became popular in the third and fourth century, but it is not known when the Clementine sections of the Ethiopic manuscripts containing the Apocalypse of Peter were originally written. Daniel Maier proposes an Egyptian origin in the 6th–10th centuries, while Richard Bauckham suggests the author was familiar with the Arabic Apocalypse of Peter and proposes an origin in the 8th century or later.

Later apocalyptic works inspired by the Apocalypse of Peter include the Apocalypse of Thomas in the 2nd–4th century, and more influentially, the Apocalypse of Paul in the 4th century. One change that the Apocalypse of Paul makes is describing personal judgments that happen immediately after death and decide whether a soul receives bliss or torment, rather than the Apocalypse of Peter being a vision of a future destiny that will take place after the Second Coming of Jesus. Hell and paradise are both on a future Earth in Peter, but are another realm of existence in Paul. The Apocalypse of Paul is also more interested in condemning sins committed by insufficiently devout Christians, while the Apocalypse of Peter seems to view the righteous as a unified group. The Apocalypse of Paul never saw official Church approval. Despite this, it would go on to be popular and influential for centuries, possibly due to the high esteem in which it was held among medieval monks. Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; would become extremely popular and celebrated in the 14th century and beyond, and was influenced by the Apocalypse of Paul. The Apocalypse of Peter thus was the forerunner of these influential visions of the afterlife: Emiliano Fiori wrote that it contains the &quot;embryonic forms&quot; of the heaven and hell of the Apocalypse of Paul, and Jan Bremmer wrote that the Apocalypse of Paul was &quot;the most important step in the direction that would find its apogee in Dante&quot;.

==Analysis==
===The punishments and &quot;lex talionis&quot;===

The list of punishments for the damned is likely the most influential and famous part of the work, with almost two-thirds of the text dedicated to the calamitous end times that will accompany the return of Jesus (Chapters 4–6) and the punishments afterward (Chapters 7–13). The punishments in the vision generally correspond to the past sinful actions, usually with a correspondence between the body part that sinned and the body part that is tortured. It is a loose version of the Jewish notion of an eye for an eye, also known as , that the punishment should fit the crime. The phrase &quot;each according to his deed&quot; appears five times in the Ethiopic version to explain the punishments. Dennis Buchholz writes that the verse &quot;Everyone according to his deeds&quot; is the theme of the entire work. In a dialogue with the angel Tatirokos, the keeper of Tartarus, the damned themselves admit that their fate is based on their own deeds, and is fair and just. The role reversal seen in the punishment of the wealthy who neglected poor widows and orphans is perhaps the most direct example, with them wearing filthy rags: they suffer exactly as they let others suffer. Still, the connection between the crime and the punishment is not always obvious. David Fiensy writes that &quot;It is possible that where there is no logical correspondence, the punishment has come from the Orphic tradition and has simply been clumsily attached to a vice by a Jewish redactor.&quot;

Bart Ehrman contests classifying the ethics of the Apocalypse as being those of , and considers bodily correspondence the overriding concern instead. For Ehrman, the punishments described are far more severe than the original crime – which goes against the idea of punishments being commensurate to the damage inflicted within &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;.

Callie Callon suggests a philosophy of &quot;mirror punishment&quot; as motivating the punishments where the harm done is reflected in a sort of poetic justice, and is determined more by symbolism than by the . She argues that this best explains the logic behind placing sorcerers in a wheel of fire, considered unclear by scholars such as Fiensy. Other scholars have suggested that it is perhaps a weak reference to the punishment of Ixion in Greek mythology; Callon suggests that it is, instead, a reference to a rhombus, a spinning top that was also used by magicians. The magicians had spun a rhombus for power in their lives, and now were tormented by similar spinning, with the usual addition of fire seen in other punishments.

The text is somewhat corrupt and unclear in Chapter 11, known only from the Ethiopic version, which describes the punishment for those who dishonor their parents. The nature of the first punishment is hard to discern and involves going up to a high fiery place, perhaps a volcano. It is believed by most translators that the target was closer to &quot;adults who abandon their elderly parents&quot; rather than condemning disobedient children, but it is difficult to be certain. However, the next punishments do target children, saying that those who fail to heed tradition and their elders will be devoured by birds, while girls who do not maintain their virginity before marriage (implicitly also a violation of parental expectations) will have their flesh torn apart. This is possibly an instance of mirror punishment or bodily correspondence, where the skin which sinned is itself punished. The text also specifies ten girls are punished – possibly a loose reference to the Parable of the Ten Virgins in the Gospel of Matthew, although not a very accurate one if so, as only five virgins are reprimanded in the parable, and for unrelated reasons.

The Apocalypse of Peter is one of the earliest pieces of Christian literature to feature an anti-abortion message; mothers who abort their children are among those tormented.

===Christology===
The Akhmim Greek text generally refers to Jesus as , &quot;Lord&quot;. The Ethiopic manuscripts are similar, but the style notably shifts in Chapters 15 and 16 in the last section of the work, which refer to Jesus by name and introduce him with exalted titles including &quot;Jesus Christ our King&quot; (&quot;negus&quot;) and &quot;my God Jesus Christ&quot;. This is considered a sign this section was edited later by a scribe with a high Christology.

===Angels and demons===
It is unknown how much of the angelology and demonology in the Ethiopic version was in the older Greek versions. The Akhmim version does not mention demons when describing the punishment of those who forsook God&#x27;s commandments; even in Ethiopic, it is possible that the demons are servants of God performing the punishment, rather than those who led the damned into sin. As the Ethiopic version was likely a translation of an Arabic translation, it may have picked up some influence from Islam centuries later; the references to Ezrael the Angel of Wrath were possibly influenced by Azrael the Angel of Death, who is usually more associated with Islamic angelology. The Ethiopic version does make it clear that punishments are envisioned not just for human sin, but also supernatural evil: the angel Uriel gives physical bodies to the evil spirits that inhabited idols and led people astray so that they, too, can be burned in the fire and punished. Sinners who perished in the Great Flood are brought back as well: probably a reference to the Nephilim, the children of the Watchers (fallen angels) and mortal women described in the Book of Enoch and the Book of Jubilees.

The children who died by infanticide are delivered to the angel &quot;Temelouchus&quot;, which probably was a rare Greek word meaning &quot;care-taking [one]&quot;. Later writers seem to have interpreted it as a proper name, however, resulting in a specific angel of hell appearing named &quot;Temlakos&quot; (Ethiopic) or &quot;Temeluchus&quot; (Greek), found in the Apocalypse of Paul and various other sources.

===Literary merits===
Scholars of the 19th and 20th century considered the work rather intellectually simple and naive; dramatic and gripping, but not necessarily a coherent story. Still, the Apocalypse of Peter was popular and had a wide audience in its time. M. R. James remarked that his impression was that educated Christians of the later Roman period considered the work somewhat embarrassing and &quot;realized it was a gross and vulgar book&quot;, which might have partially explained a lack of elite enthusiasm for canonizing it later.

===Theology===
One of the theological messages of the Apocalypse of Peter is generally considered clear enough: the torments of hell are meant to encourage keeping a righteous path and to warn readers and listeners away from sin, knowing the horrible fate that awaits those who stray. The work also responds to the problem of theodicy addressed in earlier writings such as Daniel: the question of why a sovereign and just God allows the persecution of the righteous on Earth. The Apocalypse says that everyone will be repaid by their deeds, even the dead, and God will eventually make things right. Scholars have come up with different interpretations of the intended tone of the work. Michael Gilmour sees the work as encouraging schadenfreude and delighting in the suffering of the wicked, while Eric Beck argues the reverse: that the work was intended to ultimately cultivate compassion for those suffering, including the wicked and even persecutors. Most scholars agree that the Apocalypse simultaneously advocates for both divine justice and divine mercy, and contains elements of both messages.

The version of the Apocalypse seen in the Ethiopic version could plausibly have originated from a Christian community that still considered itself as part of Judaism. The adaptation of the fig tree parables to an allegory about the flourishing of Israel and its martyrs pleasing God is only found in Chapter 2 of the Ethiopic version. While it is impossible to know for sure why it is absent in the Greek Akhmim version, one possibility is that it was edited out due to incipient anti-Jewish sentiment in the church. A depiction of Jews converting and Israel being especially blessed may have fit poorly with the strong repudiation of Judaism common in the Church during the 4th and 5th centuries.

In one passage in Chapter 16, Peter offers to build three tabernacles on Earth. Jesus sharply rebukes him, saying that there is only a single heavenly tabernacle. This is possibly a reference to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD and a condemnation of attempting to build a replacement &quot;Third Temple&quot;, although perhaps it is only a reference to all of God&#x27;s elect living together with a unified tabernacle in Paradise.

==Debate over canonicity==

The Apocalypse of Peter was ultimately not included in the New Testament, but appears to have been one of the works that came closest to being included, along with &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;. The Muratorian fragment is one of the earliest-created extant lists of approved Christian sacred writings, part of the process of creating what would eventually be called the New Testament. The fragment is generally dated to the late 2nd century (). It gives a list of works read in the Christian churches that is similar to the modern accepted canon; however, it does not include some of the general epistles, but does include the Apocalypse of Peter. The Muratorian fragment states: &quot;We receive only the apocalypses of John and Peter, though some of us are not willing that the latter be read in the church.&quot; (Other pieces of apocalyptic literature are implicitly acknowledged, yet not &quot;received&quot;.) Both the Apocalypse of Peter and the Apocalypse of John (the Book of Revelation) appear to have been controversial, with some churches of the 2nd and 3rd centuries using them and others not. A common criticism of those who opposed the canonicity of these works was to accuse them of lacking apostolic authorship.

Clement of Alexandria appears to have considered the Apocalypse of Peter to be holy scripture (). Eusebius personally classified the work as inauthentic and spurious, yet not heretical, in his book &quot;Church History&quot; (). Eusebius also describes a lost work of Clement&#x27;s, the (Outlines), that gave &quot;abbreviated discussions of the whole of the registered divine writings, without passing over the disputed [writings] – I mean Jude and the rest of the general letters, and the Letter of Barnabas, and the so-called Apocalypse of Peter.&quot; The Apocalypse of Peter is listed in the catalog of the 6th-century Codex Claromontanus, which was probably copying a 3rd- or 4th-century source. The entry in the catalog is marked with an obelus (along with the Epistle of Barnabas, &quot;The Shepherd of Hermas&quot;, and the Acts of Paul): probably an indication by the scribe that its status was not authoritative. As late as the 5th century, Sozomen indicates that some churches in Palestine still read it, but by then, it seems to have been considered inauthentic by most Christians. The Byzantine-era Stichometry of Nicephorus lists both the Apocalypses of Peter and John as used if disputed books.

Although these references to it attest that it was in wide circulation in the 2nd and 3rd century, the Apocalypse of Peter was ultimately not accepted into the Christian biblical canon, although the reason why is not entirely clear. One hypothesis for why the Apocalypse of Peter failed to gain enough support to be canonized is that its view on the afterlife was too close to endorsing Christian universalism and the related doctrine of , that God will make all things perfect in the fullness of time. The passage in the Rainer fragment that the saints, seeing the torment of sinners from heaven, could ask God for mercy, and these damned souls could be retroactively baptized and saved, had significant theological implications. Presumably, all of hell could eventually be emptied in such a manner. M. R. James argued that the original Apocalypse of Peter may well have suggested universal salvation after a period of cleansing suffering in hell. This ran against the stance of many Church theologians of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries who strongly felt that salvation and damnation were eternal and strictly based on actions and beliefs while alive. Augustine of Hippo, in his work &quot;The City of God&quot;, denounces arguments based on very similar logic to what is seen in the Rainer passage. Such a system, where saints could at least pray their friends and family out of hell, and possibly any damned soul, would have been considered incorrect at best, and heretical at worst. Most scholars since agree with James: the reading in the Rainer fragment was that of the original. The contested passage was not copied by later scribes who felt it was in error, hence not appearing in later manuscripts, along with the addition of the sentences indicating the punishment would be eternal. Bart Ehrman suggests that the damage to the book&#x27;s reputation was already done, however. The Origenist Controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries retroactively condemned much of the thought of the theologian Origen, particularly his belief in universal salvation, and this anti-Origen movement was at least part of why the book was not included in the biblical canons of later centuries.

<doc id="568780" wikidata="Q127897" url="?curid=568780" title="Jersey Girl (2004 film)">
<text>Jersey Girl is a 2004 American comedy-drama film written, co-edited and directed by Kevin Smith. It stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler with George Carlin (in his final film appearance), Stephen Root, Mike Starr, Raquel Castro, Jason Biggs and Jennifer Lopez in supporting roles. The film follows a widowed man who must learn how to properly take care of his precocious daughter after her mother dies during childbirth.

It was the first film written and directed by Smith not set in the View Askewniverse as well as the first that didn&#x27;t feature appearances by Jay and Silent Bob, although animated versions of them appear in the View Askew logo at the beginning of the film and the still version at the end. At $35 million, not including marketing costs, it was then Smith&#x27;s biggest-budgeted film, and was a box office bomb, grossing just $36 million.

==Plot==
Ollie Trinké is a young Anglo man who was born and raised in New Jersey. He now lives and works in New York City and is a powerful media publicist. Gertrude Steiney is an attractive young Latina woman. The two meet, fall instantly in love and get married. They are very happy and after several months together, Gertrude discovers she is pregnant. Ollie is obsessed with his work and doesn&#x27;t lighten his workload, neglecting Gertrude in favor of his career. On her due date, Gertrude goes into labor, and Ollie has to force himself to leave his office to be with his wife in the delivery room. Tragedy strikes, however, when Gertrude dies from an aneurysm and complications during childbirth. Their daughter is named Gertie after her late mother.

Ollie is devastated and avoids his feelings of grief by burying himself in his work, spending even longer hours at the office. He denies he feels any grief, but spends very little time with his newborn daughter because she reminds him of his late wife and all he lost. His widowed father, Bart, steps up to take care of his grand-daughter, taking a month off from his job at the Jersey City Sanitation Crew. Bart later decides to return to work to force his son to face both his grief and his responsibilities as a parent.

Things don&#x27;t go smoothly for Ollie in this new arrangement. Under the stress of a botched diaper change and a baby who will not stop crying, Ollie publicly insults his client Will Smith for starring in &quot;Independence Day&quot; because he doubts he has the credibility to be an action star. Because Ollie&#x27;s outburst occurred in front of a large group of assembled reporters, it cost him his job. This causes more upheaval in his life because he and Gertie not only have to move to New Jersey, they have to live with Bart. There is more fallout and upheaval from Ollie&#x27;s outburst. He is blacklisted by every NYC public relations firm, forcing him to take a civil service job in the borough where he now lives.

Seven years later, Gertie, now in elementary school, often begs her dad to rent films to watch. At the video store, they meet Maya, a graduate student and one of the store&#x27;s clerks. Her uninhibited probing into Ollie&#x27;s love life opens the door for her to become a part of his inner circle.

Another turning point occurs in Ollie&#x27;s life when his employer schedules a major public works project that will temporarily close a street in the neighborhood. He must speak to a group of outraged citizens and attempt to win their approval. His successful and positive interaction with them makes him realize how much he misses public relations. Seeking a change, he contacts Arthur Brickman, his one-time protégé, who sets up a promising interview in New York City.

The prospect of moving back to New York creates tension between Ollie, Gertie, Bart, and Maya, especially when they learn his interview is on the same day as Gertie&#x27;s school talent show. One night, during a big fight between the family, Ollie tells Gertie they&#x27;re moving back to New York whether she likes it or not. Gertie angrily accuses him of yet again putting himself before her before stating that she hates him and wishes he had died instead of her mother. Enraged, Ollie tells Gertie he hates her, too, screaming that both she and her mother took his life away from him and that he just wants it back. This shocks everyone. Gertie then breaks down crying and runs to her room. A very disappointed Bart quietly chastises Ollie for what he said.

A few days later, father and daughter reconcile, apologizing for their hurtful words, and Gertie accepts that they will be moving to New York. While awaiting his job interview, Ollie has a chance encounter with Will Smith. Smith doesn&#x27;t remember the past incident with him, but their conversation about work and children convinces Ollie to skip the interview and leave. Before leaving, he refers Smith to Brickman.

Ollie rushes to make it to Gertie&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; performance and arrives at the last moment. Ollie, Gertie, Bart, Maya and their friends then celebrate at a bar. There, he and Maya hint at possible feelings for each other, but are interrupted by Gertie.

Ollie then takes Gertie in his arms and tells her that they are staying in New Jersey because he decided not to take the job. She asks why, if he loved New York so much. He explains that he thought he did, but he actually loves his new life in New Jersey more. He tells Gertie that being a father to her was the only thing he was ever really good at.

== Cast ==
==Production==
The film&#x27;s budget included $10 million for Affleck and $4 million for Lopez. In the original draft of the script, Bruce Willis rather than Will Smith was the cause of (and eventual resolution to) Ollie&#x27;s problems. Smith wrote the first fifty pages of the script with Bill Murray and Joey Lauren Adams in mind. The film was primarily shot in Highlands, New Jersey. Academy Award-winning Vilmos Zsigmond, its director of photography, was said by Smith to have been &quot;an ornery old cuss who made the crew miserable.&quot; Paulsboro, New Jersey served as another of the shooting locations; scenes were shot there at its municipal building, Clam Digger Bar, and high school. Cut from it were scenes at Paulsboro&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Catholic Church (now St. Mary the Queen Coptic Orthodox Church) and Little League Field. The scene in the church was to show the marriage between Ollie and Gertie; it was cut shortly after Affleck and Lopez split up in real life and their scenes were reshot, reducing her part due to concern over the poor box-office reception of &quot;Gigli&quot;.

It is the first major theatrical release to include a joke about the September 11 attacks: when Gertie asks to see &quot;Cats&quot;, Ollie refuses on the grounds that it is &quot;the second-worst thing to happen to New York City.&quot; On the second episode of the podcast &quot;Blow Hard with Malcolm Ingram&quot;, Smith tells a story of Malcolm sending him lyrics to &quot;Landslide&quot; by Fleetwood Mac, trying to apologize for an earlier incident. He was so touched by the email that he included the song in the soundtrack.

Jason Mewes, who plays Jay in the View Askewniverse films, was to have a part in the film as &quot;Delivery Guy&quot;, but Kevin Smith had temporarily severed ties with him as part of a &quot;tough love&quot; approach to get him to quit using heroin following &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), making this so far the only film in Smith&#x27;s filmography not to feature him, although archival audio of him is used for animated Jay during the opening &quot;View Askew Productions&quot; production logo. The role was given to Matthew Maher.

== Release ==
The film is Smith&#x27;s first to have received a PG-13 rating, rather than an R. According to interviews with Smith in the documentary &quot;This Film Is Not Yet Rated,&quot; it was originally given an R, due to the dialogue with Ollie and Maya discussing masturbation in the diner, but the decision was overturned. An extended cut was shown at Kevin Smith&#x27;s private film festival Vulgarthon in 2005 &amp; 2006. The extended version included much more of the Jennifer Lopez section, Ben Affleck&#x27;s full speech at city hall, a longer ending, and some music changes. On the film&#x27;s audio commentary, Smith stated that a longer version would be released within the next year. At a Q&amp;A session in Vancouver in early 2009, Smith said that a release of the extended cut on DVD and Blu-ray Disc is &quot;very possible”. In 2023, following Paramount Pictures’ purchase of Miramax, Smith announced that the extended cut would screen at his theatre ‘Smodcastle Cinemas’ in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey as a one-night only event. As of 2025, this cut has not been released publicly. 

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $25.2 million in North America, and $10.8 million internationally, for a total gross of $36.1 million, against a $35 million budget.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Jersey Girl&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 43% based on 177 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A surprisingly conventional romantic comedy from Kevin Smith, &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; is warm but often overly sentimental&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Smith was quoted saying his film was &quot;not for critics&quot;. Smith&#x27;s reaction to &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; after its failure was dour. He referenced the film during his cameo appearance in &quot;&quot;, jokingly telling Paige Michalchuk, whom his character had cut out of his fictional film &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!&quot;, that he cut Lopez out of most of &quot;Jersey Girl&quot; and wanted to cut Affleck out too, &quot;but then it just would have been that little kid.&quot; In an interview on the &quot;Clerks II&quot; DVD, Smith noted &quot;All these people were just trashing this movie&#x27;s stars instead of looking at the movie itself. I get that a lot of people didn&#x27;t like it but dude, I spent two years of my life on that movie.&quot;

The film was nominated for three Razzie Awards: Worst Actor for Ben Affleck, Worst Supporting Actress for Jennifer Lopez, and according to the press release, &quot;Ben Affleck and either Jennifer Lopez or Liv Tyler&quot; for Worst On-Screen Couple. Raquel Castro won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Young Actress Age Ten or Younger, for her performance, and the film was nominated for Best Family Feature Film – Comedy or Musical, but lost to &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;.

<text>In politics, a common front is an alliance between different groups, forces, or interests in pursuit of a common goal or in opposition to a common enemy. Other words that may be used are &quot;alliance&quot; or &quot;coalition&quot;, though the term &quot;common front&quot; is often used when groups want to emphasize that their alliance is of a temporary nature and that individual groups within the front maintain their independence and do not consider themselves subservient to a collective leadership.

The practice of uniting with anyone against a common enemy is called frontism. Historically, it has been a practice of Marxist–Leninist parties to unite with non-communist forces in revolution. In left-wing politics, there are two main types of common fronts: the popular front and the united front.

<text>Michael Benjamin Bay (born February 17, 1965) is an American film director and producer. He is best known for making big-budget high-concept action films with fast cutting, stylistic cinematography and visuals, and extensive use of special effects, including frequent depictions of explosions. The films he has directed include &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995) and its sequel &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; (2003), &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1998), &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001), the first five films in the &quot;Transformers&quot; film series, &quot;13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi&quot; (2016), &quot;6 Underground&quot; (2019), and &quot;Ambulance&quot; (2022). His films have grossed over worldwide, making him one of the most commercially successful directors in history.

He is co-founder of the production house the Institute. He co-owns Platinum Dunes, a production house which has remade horror films, including &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003), &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (2005), &quot;The Hitcher&quot; (2007), &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (2009) and &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; (2010).

==Early life and education ==
Bay was born in Los Angeles. He was raised by his adoptive parents Harriet, a bookstore owner and child psychiatrist, and Jim, a Certified Public Accountant. He was raised Jewish. His grandfather was from Russia. His cousin, Susan Bay, is the widow of &quot;Star Trek&quot; actor Leonard Nimoy (whom he eventually cast as the voice actor for Sentinel Prime in &quot;&quot;). He attended the exclusive Crossroads School in Santa Monica, California.

Bay often traces his interest in action films back to an incident during his childhood. As a boy, he attached some firecrackers to a toy train and filmed the ensuing fiery disaster with his mother&#x27;s 8 millimeter camera. The fire department was called and he was grounded.

Bay got his start in the film industry interning with George Lucas when he was 15, filing the storyboards for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, which Bay believed was going to be terrible. His opinion changed after seeing it in the theater and he was so impressed by the experience that he decided to become a film director. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1986, majoring in both English and film. He was a member of the Psi Upsilon fraternity and a favorite student of film historian Jeanine Basinger. For his graduate work, he attended Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, where he also studied film. His classmates included future Hollywood film directors Tarsem Singh and Zack Snyder. Singh also appeared in one of Bay&#x27;s student films as a camel salesman.

== Career ==
=== 1992–2005: Breakthrough and stardom ===
Bay began working at Propaganda Films, directing commercials and music videos, two weeks after finishing his postgraduate degree. His 90-second World War II–inspired Coca-Cola advertisement was picked up by Capitol Records. His first national commercial was for the Red Cross, which won a Clio Award in 1992. He directed Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners&#x27; &quot;Aaron Burr&quot; commercial as part of the &quot;Got Milk?&quot; ad campaign for the California Milk Processors Board in 1993, which also won a Grand Prix Clio Award for Commercial of the Year.

Bay&#x27;s success in music videos gained the attention of producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, who selected him to direct his first feature-length film, &quot;Bad Boys&quot;. It was shot in Miami in 1994 and starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The action film was a breakout role for Smith, who was making a transition from television at the time. Shooting in Miami was a good experience for Bay, who would later own a home in the city and spend a great deal of time there. The film was completed for $19 million and grossed a remarkable $141 million in the summer of 1995. Bay&#x27;s success led to a strong partnership and friendship with Jerry Bruckheimer.

His follow-up film, &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), an action movie set on Alcatraz Island and in the San Francisco Bay area, starred Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. It was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson, who died five months before its release. The film is dedicated to him. Connery and Cage won &quot;Best On-Screen Duo&quot; at the MTV Movie Awards in 1997, and the film was nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Achievement in Sound category for the work of Greg P. Russell, Kevin O&#x27;Connell and Keith A. Wester. After the success of &quot;The Rock&quot;, Bay established his production company Bay Films, with a two-picture deal with Disney.

In 1998, Bay again collaborated with Jerry Bruckheimer, this time as a co-producer, as well as directing the action-adventure film &quot;Armageddon&quot;. The film, about a group of tough oil drillers who are sent by NASA to deflect an asteroid from a collision course with Earth, starred Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. It was nominated for four Oscars at the 71st Academy Awards, including Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing and Best Original Song. It earned $9.6 million on its opening day and $36.5 million through the first weekend. Its budget of $140 million was one of the highest of the summer of 1998. It went on to gross over $553 million worldwide, the highest-grossing film of that year.

In 2001, Bay directed &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale and Cuba Gooding, Jr. It was released on Memorial Day weekend in 2001, again produced by Bay with Jerry Bruckheimer. It received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Sound, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Editing and Best Song. Kevin O&#x27;Connell received another nomination for Best Sound, but did not win. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; won in the category for Sound Editing, making it Bay&#x27;s first (and, to date, only) film to win an Oscar. Bay also directed the music video for the nominated track &quot;There You&#x27;ll Be&quot; by vocal artist Faith Hill.

Bay reteamed with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence for &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, a sequel that was Bay&#x27;s fifth collaboration with Jerry Bruckheimer. It grossed $138 million domestically, enough to cover the production budget, and $273 million worldwide, almost twice as much as the first movie. In 2005, Bay directed &quot;The Island&quot;, a science fiction film starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. It was the first film Bay made without Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer. It cost $126 million to produce and earned $36 million domestically and $127 million overseas, for a total of $163 million. Bay said that he was not comfortable with the domestic marketing campaign, as it confused the audience about the film&#x27;s true subject.

=== 2007–2016 ===

In 2007, he teamed up with executive producer Steven Spielberg to direct &quot;Transformers&quot;, a live action film based on the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise. Released in July 2007, by November of that year it had made over $709 million worldwide.

Bay returned as director and executive producer for &quot;&quot;, which was released on June 24, 2009 and grossed over $832 million worldwide. Although it received mostly negative reviews by critics, including aggressively critical reviews by American film critics such as Roger Ebert, Michael Phillips and David Denby (who referred to Bay as &quot;stunningly, almost viciously, untalented&quot;), the film was well received by its intended audience and one of the highest-grossing of 2009. In 2010, it earned seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations, and won three: Worst Picture, Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. It was also one of the best-selling DVD and Blu-ray Discs of 2009, second only to &quot;Twilight&quot; in DVD format, and the #1 of all time in Blu-ray format until it was surpassed by Blu-ray sales of James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot; in April 2010.

Bay directed &quot;&quot;, released on June 29, 2011, which grossed $1.123 billion globally. His next film was a comparatively small one he had been developing for years, called &quot;Pain &amp; Gain&quot;. The true crime story, based on events described in a &quot;Miami New Times&quot; article by Pete Collins, concerns a group of bumbling bodybuilders working together to commit a robbery. It starred Mark Wahlberg, Dwayne Johnson, Anthony Mackie, Tony Shalhoub and Ed Harris.

Bay produced DreamWorks&#x27; &quot;I Am Number Four&quot;, based on a series of novels by Pittacus Lore published by HarperCollins Children&#x27;s Books. D. J. Caruso (&quot;Eagle Eye&quot;, &quot;Disturbia&quot;) directed.

A fourth Bay-directed Transformers movie, &quot;&quot;, was released in June 2014. Starring Mark Wahlberg, it earned $1.1 billion at the global box office. On January 12, 2016, Paramount Pictures released &quot;13 Hours&quot;, which Bay produced and directed, based on the 2012 Benghazi attack. While the lowest-grossing film of Bay&#x27;s career at the box office, it went on to massive DVD sales on its digital release in May 2016, earning over $40 million in home video revenue.

=== 2017–present ===
On May 23, 2017, Bay was honored with his own hand-and-footprint ceremony at The TCL Chinese Theatre. His English mastiff, Rebel, put her paw in the cement with him.

Bay&#x27;s fifth &quot;Transformers&quot; film as director, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 21, 2017. It grossed $68.5 million in its five-day North American opening weekend, the franchise&#x27;s lowest opening, and $605 million worldwide. In a 2016 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Bay said it would be his final &quot;Transformers&quot; film as director.

In 2018, it was announced that Bay would direct the Netflix action thriller film &quot;6 Underground&quot;, starring Ryan Reynolds, Mélanie Laurent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Adria Arjona, Corey Hawkins, Ben Hardy and Dave Franco. It was released on December 13, 2019. In August 2019, Bay signed to direct the action film &quot;Black Five&quot; for Sony Pictures. However, the film, which was set to begin production in 2020, was put on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Bay subsequently moved on to direct &quot;Ambulance&quot;.

Bay produced the pandemic-themed thriller &quot;Songbird&quot; starting Demi Moore, Craig Robinson, Paul Walter Hauser and Peter Stormare. He is set to direct the dystopian thriller &quot;Little America,&quot; which was scheduled to film in California sometime in 2020.

In 2021, it was reported that Bay requested financial compensation from film studio Paramount Pictures for indirectly limiting his income as a result of Paramount cutting the theatrical-only run of &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot; from 90 to 45 days due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bay, and other producers as well as actors for the film, as is typically the case, receive payment in part based on box-office performance, and a reduction in the theatrical run&#x27;s exclusivity affected the pay they received.

Bay&#x27;s next film was 2022&#x27;s &quot;Ambulance&quot;, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Eiza González. It follows two bank robbers who hijack an ambulance and take two hostages. Shot during the COVID-19 pandemic in Los Angeles, it was released in the US on April 8, 2022, by Universal Pictures.

In February 2023, Bay was hired to direct and executive produce an untitled action drama series for A&amp;E Studios and Amazon Studios.

In July 2024, it was reported that Bay was developing a franchise based on Alexey Gerasimov&#x27;s &quot;Skibidi Toilet&quot; web series.

On September 2, 2024, Bay&#x27;s first documentary series, &quot;Born Evil: The Serial Killer and the Savior&quot;, premiered on Investigation Discovery. Bay directed and executive produced the five-episode series about serial killer Hadden Clark.

On October 7, 2024, Bay was set to direct the film &quot;Fast and Loose&quot;, with Chris Bremner and Eric Pearson writing the screenplay.

==Production and effects companies==

===Platinum Dunes===

Bay founded production house Platinum Dunes with fellow producers Brad Fuller and Andrew Form in 2001.

===Digital Domain===

Bay and Wyndcrest Holdings, a Florida-based investment firm, acquired the digital effects company Digital Domain from James Cameron and Stan Winston in 2006, infusing the struggling business with a $50 million investment. Digital Domain considered an initial public offering in 2009 but withdrew the offer due to lack of interest. It was sold to the production group Beijing Galloping Horse in 2012.

===The Institute===
After leaving Propaganda Films, Bay and producer Scott Gardenhour, also formerly at Propaganda, formed the Institute for the Development of Enhanced Perceptual Awareness (now known as the Institute), to produce commercials and other projects. Through the Institute, Bay has directed and produced spots for Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Lexus, Budweiser, Reebok, Mercedes-Benz, and Nike. One of his Victoria&#x27;s Secret ads was for the 2009 &quot;A Thousand Fantasies&quot; holiday campaign.

===451 Media Group===
Bay co-founded 451 Media Group with Doug Nunes (who is CEO), and with John and Anthony Gentile, who previously marketed brands such as Micronauts, &quot;&quot;, Sky Dancers and the Power Glove. In 2015, the company announced an interactive publishing division to offer &quot;augmented reality&quot; content from printed graphic novels with digital video. The graphic novels employ Touchcode technology from T+ink (previously used in the Power Glove), in which ink used in the printing process unlocks access to exclusive content that is housed on the Machinima Network, which is transferred to users&#x27; touch-screen-enabled mobile devices when the printed books are touched to those devices. The company&#x27;s premiere slate of graphic novels was unveiled at the October 2015 New York Comic Con. The creators involved included Scott Rosenberg, Skip Woods, George Pelecanos, Mark Mallouk, Clay McLeod Chapman and Peter and Paul Williams.

===Rogue Initiative===
In June 2016, Bay joined the Rogue Initiative, a production studio and technology company, as a strategic advisor and stakeholder. The studio merges Hollywood production with interactive talent to generate story-driven content for games, mobile, virtual reality, mixed reality, television and feature film. As part of the partnership, Bay will develop and direct a multiplatform action-adventure game and cinematic VR experiences, based on an original IP conceived by him.

==Personal life==
Bay lives in Miami with his three English mastiffs, named for characters in his films. As a boy, he donated his Bar Mitzvah money to an animal shelter and he now often includes his dogs in his films. Bonecrusher appeared as Mikaela&#x27;s dog &quot;Bones&quot; in &quot;&quot;. Mason, his first English mastiff, was named for John Patrick Mason, played by Sean Connery in &quot;The Rock&quot;. Mason appeared as Marcus&#x27;s dog in &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; and as Miles&#x27; dog in &quot;Transformers&quot;; he died during production of the latter film in March 2007.

Bay is not married and has no children. He previously dated sportscaster Lisa Dergan.

In a 2016 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Bay said that his net worth was around $500 million. He owned a $50 million Gulfstream G550 jet, as well as a Bentley, a Range Rover, an Escalade, a Ferrari, a Lamborghini, and two Camaros from the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise.

In February 2025, Bay was arrested after breaking into the Vatican.

==Filmography==


== Critical reception ==
Bay&#x27;s work is divisive and has often been poorly received by film critics, and his name has been used pejoratively in art-house circles. Bay has responded to his critics, saying: &quot;I make movies for teenage boys. Oh, dear, what a crime.&quot; Besides accusing him of making films that pander to a young demographic, critics and audiences have been critical of elements of Bay&#x27;s filmmaking style such as the overuse of Dutch angles, extreme patriotism, overly broad and sophomoric humor, excessive product placement, oversaturated orange and teal color grading, reusing footage from his previous films, and his preference of action and spectacle over story and characters, with his films&#x27; excessive use of explosions often being mentioned or parodied. Another point of contention with Bay&#x27;s films is his portrayal and use of offensive racial stereotypes as comedic relief; one alleged example being the characters Skids and Mudflap in &quot;&quot;.

Bay has also been accused of heavily objectifying women in his films, with critics describing Bay&#x27;s manner of filming actresses as &quot;lascivious&quot; and &quot;pornographic&quot;. He has faced criticism for routinely making sexist remarks and showing female characters in a stereotypical light. He came under scrutiny for firing Megan Fox in retaliation after she made comments about him mistreating her on the set of the &quot;Transformers&quot; films and compared him to Adolf Hitler and Napoleon. Bay published an open letter written by three anonymous members of the crew of &quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&quot; that referred to Fox as, among other things, &quot;Ms. Sourpants&quot;, &quot;porn star&quot;, &quot;unfriendly bitch&quot;, and &quot;dumb-as-a-rock&quot;.

In 2009, it was reported that Fox, at the age of 15, was made to wash Bay&#x27;s car while auditioning for &quot;Transformers&quot;. In 2020, Fox revisited the incident and denied that she was underaged (for &quot;Transformers&quot;) or &quot;made to &#x27;wash&#x27; or work on someone&#x27;s cars in a way that was extraneous from the materials in the actual script.&quot; Fox was 15 when she first appeared as a bikini-clad extra in the Bay film &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;.

Actress Kate Beckinsale also spoke out publicly by reporting that she was body-shamed and regularly criticized for her appearance by Bay during the making of &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.

Six of Bay&#x27;s films have been nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture and Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director (&quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&quot;, &quot;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Transformers: Age of Extinction&quot; and &quot;Transformers: The Last Knight&quot;), with &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot; and &quot;Age of Extinction&quot; winning the award for &quot;Worst Director&quot;. &quot;Revenge of the Fallen&quot; also became the first film by Bay and also the highest-grossing film to be awarded &quot;Worst Picture&quot;.

Conversely, some critics and actors have praised Bay&#x27;s films and style. Film historian Jeanine Basinger has described him as &quot;the most cinematic and fluid and unafraid director&quot;, while Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety&quot; has lauded his &quot;grand, epic vision&quot; and positively compared him to William Wyler. Actress Scarlett Johansson wrote that Bay is &quot;a truly ambitious storyteller who celebrates characters, actors, and leading men and women alike.&quot;

Stanton Swihart of AllMusic wrote: &quot;From beginning to end, Gang Starr&#x27;s third full-length album cuts with the force and precision of a machete and serves as an ode to and representation of New York and hip-hop underground culture.&quot; He added: &quot;Every song has some attribute that stamps it indelibly into the listener&#x27;s head, and it marks the album as one of the finest of the decade, rap or otherwise.&quot;

In 2017, &quot;Complex&quot; placed it at number 41 on the &quot;Best Rap Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot; list.

<text>Gregory Andrew Hunt (born 18 November 1965) is an Australian former politician who was the Minister for Health between January 2017 and May 2022. He was a Liberal Party member of the House of Representatives between November 2001 and 2022, representing the Division of Flinders in Victoria. He has previously served as a parliamentary secretary in the Howard government (2004–2007), Minister for the Environment (2013–2016), Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science (2016–2017), and Minister for Sport (2017).

From March 2020 until his retirement in May 2022, Hunt had oversight over the Australian government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Early life ==
Gregory Andrew Hunt was born on 18 November 1965 in Frankston, Victoria. He was one of five sons born to Kathinka (née Grant, known as Tinka) and Alan Hunt. His father was a solicitor by profession who had been elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in 1962, and served as a Liberal state government minister in the 1970s and 1980s. Hunt&#x27;s maternal grandmother Phyllis Forster was one of the first women to graduate from the Victorian College of Pharmacy. His mother worked as a nurse, but suffered from a form of bipolar disorder and was later institutionalised. She died of a heart attack at the age of 58, while her son was studying abroad.

Hunt grew up in Mornington, Victoria, attending Mornington Primary School and the Peninsula School. He took a gap year after leaving high school, travelling through Ireland, the Alps, Spain, and Israel. He lived on a kibbutz for several months, learning Hebrew and working in a machine shop. After returning to Australia, Hunt studied arts and law at the University of Melbourne, living at Ormond College and graduating with first-class honours. At university he developed friendships with Mary Wooldridge and John Roskam. He was head of the debating society and partnered with Rufus Black at the 1984 World Universities Debating Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, finishing in second place. He won a prize for a final-year thesis he co-authored with Black, titled &quot;A Tax to Make the Polluter Pay&quot;.

Hunt is one of seven Liberal MPs in the 46th Parliament of Australia who have obtained degrees at an Oxbridge or Ivy League university, the others being Alan Tudge, Angus Taylor, Andrew Laming, Dave Sharma, Josh Frydenberg and Paul Fletcher.

==Career==
Hunt joined law firm Mallesons Stephen Jaques after completing his undergraduate degree. In 1992 he was an associate to Michael Black, the chief justice of the Federal Court of Australia. Hunt subsequently completed a Master of Arts in International Relations at Yale University as a Fulbright Scholar. He also interned at the UN Centre for Human Rights in Geneva, &quot;researching atrocities in the former Yugoslavia&quot;.

In 1994, Hunt began working as a senior adviser to Alexander Downer, the federal leader of opposition. He remained in Downer&#x27;s office until 1998, spanning his resignation as Liberal leader and later appointment as foreign minister in the Howard government. He was the chief of the Australian Electoral Observer Mission at the 1998 Cambodian general election. Hunt subsequently worked as a senior fellow at the University of Melbourne&#x27;s Centre for Comparative Constitutional Law (1998–1999), as engagement manager at management consultants McKinsey and Co. (1999–2001), and held the position of Director of Strategy at the World Economic Forum (2000–2001). He was a foundation investor in project management software company Aconex, but had to sell his shares in 2013 when he became a government minister.

== Politics ==
=== Early career ===
Hunt was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2001 federal election, standing in the Division of Flinders. He had been asked to stand for Liberal preselection by the retiring MP Peter Reith. In 2003 he supported the invasion of Iraq by coalition forces and served as a spokesman for the Howard government&#x27;s policies.

Hunt was first elevated to the ministry following the 2004 federal election, when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. In January 2007, Hunt was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Following the Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2007 election, he was appointed Shadow Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Urban Water. His title was altered to Shadow Minister for Climate Change, Environment and Heritage after the 2010 election.

=== Abbott government (2013–2015)===
After the 2013 federal election, Hunt was appointed Minister for the Environment in the Abbott government. One of his first actions as minister was to inform Tim Flannery, the head of the Gillard government&#x27;s Climate Commission, that the government was closing this body, as per its election platform. In December 2013, he announced a project to dredge Abbot Point, which was approved by the Marine Park Authority in January 2014.

===Turnbull government (2015–2018)===
Following the change in Liberal Party leadership in September 2015, Hunt was retained as Minister for the Environment in the new Turnbull government. In February 2016, Hunt was named &quot;Best Minister in the World&quot; by a panel established by Thomson Reuters for the 2016 World Government Summit of Dubai.

With the reelection of the Turnbull government in 2016, Hunt became the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science in the Second Turnbull Ministry. Following the resignation of Sussan Ley as Health Minister in January 2017, Turnbull appointed Hunt as the Minister for Health and the Minister for Sport.

In June 2017 Hunt, Michael Sukkar and Alan Tudge faced the possibility of being prosecuted for contempt of court after they made public statements criticising the sentencing decisions of two senior judges while the government was awaiting their ruling on a related appeal. They avoided prosecution by, eventually, making an unconditional apology to the Victorian Court of Appeal. During the run up to the Victorian state elections of 2018, Hunt participated in the African gangs moral panic by stating &quot;We know that African gang crime in some areas [of Victoria] is clearly out of control. [...] The failure is not police, but the Premier.&quot;

In Turnbull&#x27;s 2020 autobiography &quot;A Bigger Picture&quot;, he described Hunt as &quot;widely distrusted by his colleagues&quot; and stated that he &quot;all too often used abusive and vulgar language towards others&quot;, including to his department secretary Martin Bowles.

===Morrison government (2018–2022)===
During the Liberal leadership crisis in August 2018, Hunt tendered his resignation as health minister. However, it was not formally accepted and he retained the position in the Morrison government several days later. Hunt stood for the deputy leadership of the party, polling 16 votes out of 82 (20 percent) compared with 46 for Josh Frydenberg and 20 for Steven Ciobo; there were three abstentions.

Hunt had a prominent role during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. He was granted authority over Australia&#x27;s strategy and response to the pandemic after the Governor-General of Australia enacted the Biosecurity Act 2015 on 23 March 2020. Hunt&#x27;s leadership over Australia&#x27;s public health response to the pandemic has received praise for its effectiveness in reducing transmission and following scientific advice. In government meetings, Hunt drew comparison&#x27;s with Australia&#x27;s shortcomings in responding to the 1918 flu pandemic to garner political support for the &quot;suppression&quot; strategy. Hunt also conducted national press briefings and has been prominent in the country&#x27;s vaccination deployment. Hunt&#x27;s ban on foreign travel for Australians during the pandemic has faced legal challenges but was upheld in court. His handling of the country’s vaccination program has drawn sharp criticism for delays and examples of mis-management, particularly in the aged care sector.

The pace of national vaccination program brought the word strollout  to the national vernacular. A blend of &quot;rollout&quot; and &quot;stroll&quot;, the word refers to the &quot;perceived lack of speed&quot; in Australia&#x27;s vaccine rollout.  On November 17, Canberra&#x27;s Australian National Dictionary Centre announced &quot;strollout&quot; as its pick for the word of the year, Two Australian dictionaries — and, in one poll, the Australian public — have chosen &quot;strollout&quot; as their word of the year for 2021.

In June 2020 Hunt announced that he would ask the Governor-General in Council to make regulations from 1 July 2020 prohibiting the importation of e-cigarettes containing vaporizer nicotine and nicotine-containing refills unless on prescription from a doctor. Hunt stated on Twitter that the Australian Government committed to shutting down the importation of vaping products on 1 July. By 27 July a petition endorsed by Senator Matthew Canavan and George Christensen and other backbenchers was signed by over 70,000 people, causing Hunt to extend this deadline. Hunt stated in a media release that he will now ask the Governor-General in Council to sign off on these regulations on 1 January 2021 to allow time for a more streamlined process for patients obtaining nicotine through their GP.

On 2 December 2021, Hunt announced his intention to retire from politics in the 2022 federal election.

In October 2022, Monash University announced the appointment of Hunt as the foundation Chair of the Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health’s Advisory Council.
==Political positions==
Hunt was described in 2017 as a &quot;&#x27;small-l liberal&#x27; from the party&#x27;s progressive wing&quot;. In 2012 he was described as &quot;a moderate who is part of Tony Abbott&#x27;s inner circle, and arguably the pre-eminent federal Liberal from Victoria&quot;. However, according to The Sydney Morning Herald in 2021, Hunt is a member of the centre-right faction of the Liberal Party.

Hunt voted for removing the ban on the abortion drug RU-486 and supported the legalisation of same-sex marriage.

In 2006 Hunt and three other Liberal MPs put forward a proposal to fund full-time chaplains in state schools, in what eventually became the National School Chaplaincy Programme. He reportedly described state schools as &quot;anti-religious&quot; and said there was &quot;a clear need in our schools for the mentoring and personal development, counselling and crisis management, the opportunity for values-based guidance and religious education that a chaplain could provide&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hunt lives in Mount Martha, Victoria. He has two children from his marriage to Paula Lindsey, a former nurse educator. His first marriage &quot;to a university sweetheart, ended amicably during his 20s&quot;.

Hunt is a qualified recreational diver. He had completed seven marathons as of 2012, and in 2020, it was reported that he runs a day. In March 2021, he was hospitalised for several days with cellulitis.

<text>Charles Tate Regan (1 February 1878 – 12 January 1943) was a British ichthyologist, working mainly around the beginning of the 20th century. He did extensive work on fish classification schemes.

Born in Sherborne, Dorset, he was educated at Derby School and Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge and in 1901 joined the staff of the Natural History Museum, where he became Keeper of Zoology, and later director of the entire museum, in which role he served from 1927 to 1938.

Regan was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1917.

Regan mentored a number of scientists, among them Ethelwynn Trewavas, who continued his work at the British Natural History Museum.

<text>Julia Claire Irwin (; born 8 November 1951) is a former Australian politician. She represented the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2010, holding the New South Wales seat of Fowler.

==Early life==
Irwin was born in Sydney on 8 November 1951. Her father Alan Welsh served on the Parramatta City Council and her mother Lois Welsh was the secretary of the New South Wales Labor Women&#x27;s Committee. She joined the ALP at the age of 15 and began her involvement in the labour movement with the Sheet Metal Working Industrial Union. She was also involved in Young Labor where she met her future husband Geoff Irwin.

In 1975, Irwin became the electorate secretary to Jack Ferguson, who became the Deputy Premier of New South Wales the following year. She later worked as a staffer for Richard Klugman, Ross Free, and Ted Grace.

==Parliament==
Following Ted Grace&#x27;s retirement, Irwin won ALP preselection for his seat of Fowler. She retained the seat for Labor at the 1998 federal election, and was re-elected on three further occasions.

In 2005 Irwin was involved in a controversy over comments she made about Israel. On 13 September she made a speech in parliament characterising Israel&#x27;s policies as &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and Gaza as a &quot;concentration camp&quot;. After criticism from Jewish groups and by members of both the Liberal and Labor parties, she issued an apology for her &quot;offensive&quot; language.

In October 2008 Irwin publicly criticised the Rudd Government&#x27;s education policy, accusing it of &quot;locking in the Coalition&#x27;s favouritism of private schools&quot;.

Irwin announced in September 2009 that she would not recontest her seat at the 2010 federal election.

<doc id="568814" wikidata="Q1144159" url="?curid=568814" title="Hurro-Urartian languages">
<text>Hurro-Urartian is an extinct language family of the Ancient Near East, comprising only two known languages: Hurrian and Urartian.

==Origins==
It is often assumed that the Hurro-Urartian languages, or a pre-split Proto-Hurro-Urartian language, were originally spoken by people of the Kura-Araxes culture which existed in Eastern Anatolia, the Caucasus, northwestern Iran and northern Levant from the late 5th millennium BC to late 3rd millennium BC.

==External classification==
While the genetic relation between Hurrian and Urartian is undisputed, the wider connections of Hurro-Urartian to other language families are controversial. After the decipherment of Hurrian and Urartian inscriptions and documents in the 19th and early 20th century, Hurrian and Urartian were soon recognized as not related to the Semitic or later arriving Indo-European languages, nor to language isolates of the region such as Sumerian language, Elamite language and Hattian language. To date, the most conservative view holds that Hurro-Urartian is a primary language family not demonstrably related to any other language family.

Early proposals for an external genetic relationship of Hurro-Urartian variously grouped them with the Kartvelian languages, Elamite, and other non-Semitic and non-Indo-European languages of the region.

Igor Diakonoff and Sergei Starostin suggested that Hurro-Urartian and the Northeastern Caucasian language family can be included in a macro-family; this grouping was provisionally dubbed the Alarodian languages, by Diakonoff. Several studies argue that the connection is probable. Other scholars doubt that the language families are related, or believe that, while a connection is possible, the evidence is far from conclusive. Uralicist and Indo-Europeanist Petri Kallio argues that the matter is hindered by the lack of consensus about how to reconstruct Proto-Northeast-Caucasian, but that Alarodian is the most promising proposal for relations with Northeast Caucasian, greater than rival proposals to link it with Northwest Caucasian or other families. 

Arnaud Fournet and Allan R. Bomhard argue that Hurro-Urartian is a sister family to Indo-European.

The poorly attested Kassite language which was certainly not Semitic or Indo-European may have belonged to the Hurro-Urartian language family.

==Contacts with other languages==
Hurrian was the language of the Hurrians, occasionally called &quot;Hurrites&quot;. It was spoken in the northern parts of Mesopotamia and Syria and the southeastern parts of Anatolia between at least the last quarter of the third millennium BC and its extinction towards the end of the second millennium BC. There were various Hurrian-speaking states, of which the most prominent one was the kingdom of Mitanni (1450–1270 BC), and also Lullubi and the Turukkaeans, the latter two also showing Semitic influence. It has been proposed that two little known groups, the Nairi and the Mannae, might have been Hurrian speakers. As little is known about them, it is hard to draw any conclusions about what languages they spoke, although there is no evidence of them being Semitic or Indo-European. 

The Kassite language was possibly related to Hurro-Urartian. Francfort and Tremblay on the basis of the Akkadian textual and archaeological evidence, proposed to identify the kingdom of Marhashi and Ancient Margiana. The Marhashite personal names seems to point towards an Eastern variant of Hurrian, or another language of the Hurro-Urartian language family rather than to Indo-European or Semitic.

There was a strong Hurrian influence on the Hittite culture in ancient times, so many Hurrian texts are preserved from Hittite political centres. The Mitanni variety is chiefly known from the so-called &quot;Mitanni letter&quot; from Hurrian Tushratta to pharaoh Amenhotep III surviving in the Amarna archives. The &quot;Old Hurrian&quot; variety is known from some early royal inscriptions and from religious and literary texts, especially from Hittite centres.

Urartian is attested from the late 9th century BC to the late 7th century BC as the official written language of the state of Urartu and was probably spoken by the majority of the population in the mountainous areas around Lake Van and the upper Zab valley. It branched off from Hurrian at approximately the beginning of the second millennium BC. Scholars, such as Paul Zimansky, contend that Urartian was only spoken by a small ruling class and was not the primary language of the majority of the population.

Although Hurro-Urartian languages gradually became extinct with the collapse of the Urartu empire following its subjugation by Assyria, Diakonoff and Greppin suggested that traces of its vocabulary survived in a small number of loanwords in Old Armenian, a later arriving Indo-European language. More recent scholarship by Arnaud Fournet, Hrach Martirosyan, Armen Petrosyan, and others has proposed more extensive contacts between the languages, including vocabulary, grammar, parts of speech, and proper nouns loaned into Armenian, such as Urartian &quot;eue&quot; (&quot;and&quot;), attested in the earliest Urartian texts (compare to Armenian &quot;yev&quot; (և, եվ), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₁epi&quot;). Other loans from Armenian into Urartian includes personal names, toponyms, and names of deities.

There are some lexical matches between Hurro-Urartian and Sumerian, which was a Language Isolate, indicating an early contact.

==Characteristics==
Besides their fairly consistent ergative alignment and their generally agglutinative morphology, despite a number of not entirely predictable morpheme mergers, Hurrian and Urartian are both characterized by the use of suffixes in their derivational and inflectional morphology, including ten to fifteen grammatical cases, and postpositions in syntax. Both are considered to have the default order subject–object–verb, although there is significant variation, especially in Urartian. 

In both languages, nouns can receive a peculiar &quot;anaphoric suffix&quot; comparable, albeit apparently not identical, to a definite article. Nominal modifiers are marked by &quot;Suffixaufnahme&quot;, i.e. they receive a &quot;copy&quot; of the case suffixes of the head. In verbs, the type of valency, intransitive vs transitive, is signalled by a special suffix, the so-called &quot;class marker&quot;. 

The complex morpheme &quot;chains&quot; of nouns and verbs follow roughly the same morpheme sequences in both languages. In nouns, the sequence in both languages is stem – article – possessive suffix – plural suffix – case suffix – agreement (&quot;Suffixaufnahme&quot;) suffix. In verbs, the portion of the structure shared by both languages is stem – valency marker – person suffixes. Most morphemes have fairly similar phonological forms in the two languages.

Despite this structural similarity, there are significant differences. In the phonology, written Hurrian only seems to distinguish a single series of phonemic obstruents without any contrastive phonation distinctions, the variation in voicing, though visible in the script, was allophonic. In contrast, written Urartian distinguishes as many as three series: voiced, voiceless and &quot;emphatic&quot;, perhaps glottalized. Urartian is characterized by the apparent reduction of some word-final vowels to schwa, e.g. Urartian &quot;ulə&quot; vs Hurrian &quot;oli&quot; &quot;another&quot;, Urartian &quot;eurišə&quot; vs Hurrian &quot;evrišše&quot; &quot;lordship&quot;, Hurrian 3rd person plural enclitic pronoun &quot;-lla&quot; vs Urartian &quot;-lə&quot;. As the last two examples shows, the Hurrian geminates are absent in Urartian.

In the morphology, there are differences. Hurrian indicates the plural of nouns through a special suffix &quot;-až-&quot;, which only survives in fossilized form merged into some case endings in Urartian. Hurrian clearly marks tense or aspect through special suffixes, the unmarked form is the present tense. Urartian has not been shown to do so in the attested texts. The unmarked form functions as a past tense. Hurrian has special negative verbal suffixes that negate a verb and are placed before the ergative person agreement suffixes. Urartian has no such thing, and instead uses negative particles that are placed before the verb. 

In Hurrian, only the person of the &quot;ergative subject&quot; is marked obligatorily through a suffix in a verb form. The &quot;absolutive&quot; subject or object is optionally marked with a pronominal enclitic that need not be attached to the verb, and can also be attached to any other word in the clause. In Urartian, the ergative suffixes and the absolutive clitics have merged into a single set of obligatory suffixes, that express the person of both the ergative and the absolutive participant and are an integral part of the verb. In general, the profusion of freely moving pronominal and conjunctional clitics that characterize Hurrian, especially that of the Mitanni letter, has few parallels in Urartian.

Urartian is closer to the so-called Old Hurrian variety, mostly attested in Hittite documents, than to the Hurrian of the Mitanni letter. For example, both use &quot;-o-/-u-&quot; (rather than &quot;-i-&quot;) as the marker of transitive valency and both display the plural suffix &quot;-it-&quot;, expressing the number of the ergative subject and occupying a position before the valency marker.

<text>Desert Research Institute (DRI) is a nonprofit research campus of the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) and a sister property of the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), the organization that oversees all publicly supported higher education in the U.S. state of Nevada. At DRI, approximately 500 research faculty and support staff engage in more than $50 million in environmental research each year. DRI&#x27;s environmental research programs are divided into three core divisions (Atmospheric Sciences, Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, and Hydrologic Sciences) and two interdisciplinary centers (Center for Arid Lands Environmental Management and the Center for Watersheds and Environmental Sustainability). Established in 1988 and sponsored by AT&amp;T, the institute&#x27;s Nevada Medal awards &quot;outstanding achievement in science and engineering&quot;.

==Programs==
===Cloud Seeding Program===
DRI weather modification research produced the Nevada State Cloud Seeding Program in the 1960s. This initiative, funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, seeks to augment snowfall in mountainous regions of Nevada to increase snowpack and water supply. DRI researchers use ground stations and aircraft to release microscopic silver iodide particles into winter clouds, stimulating the formation of ice crystals that develop to snow.

Research indicates that cloud seeding leads to precipitation rate increases of 0.1–1.5 millimeters per hour.

===Atmospheric and Dispersion Modeling Program===
For over a decade the Atmospheric and Dispersion Modeling Program team has been performing work focused on observations and modeling of atmospheric dispersion processes over complex terrain and coastal areas. In particular, the team is applying, developing, and evaluating mesoscale meteorological models as well as regulatory and advanced atmospheric dispersion models such as ISC3ST, AERMOD, WYNDVALLEY, ASPEN, and CALPUFF. They have developed a Lagrangian Random Particle Dispersion Model that has been applied to complex coastal and inland environments.

Several recent projects led to developing real-time mesoscale forecasting system using the MM5 model coupled with a Lagrangian random particle dispersion model and implementation of data assimilation schemes.

==History==
A two-page bill signed into law by the Nevada Governor Grant Sawyer on March 23, 1959, authorized establishment of the Desert Research Institute at the University of Nevada, Reno.

UNR hired Dr. Wendell Mordy as the Founding Director (1960–1969) of the University&#x27;s Desert Research Institute, which initially was an office at the top of the historic Morrill Hall building on UNR&#x27;s campus. Early on Mordy also initiated the development of the UNR&#x27;s Fleishmann Atmospherium Planetarium.

Microplastics were found for the first time in Lake Tahoe in 2019 by the Desert Research Institute. They plan on studying the pollution to determine if it is from local sources or if particles from discarded plastic products have been transported long distances through the atmosphere by wind, rain and falling snow.

<doc id="568825" wikidata="Q7490480" url="?curid=568825" title="Sharryn Jackson">
<text>Sharryn Maree Jackson (born 12 February 1962), Australian politician, was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives. She served one term from 2001 representing the Division of Hasluck before losing the seat at the 2004 federal election. She regained the seat at the 2007 federal election and was then defeated at the 2010 federal election.

Jackson was an elected member of the National Executive of the Labor Party.

==Personal life==
Jackson was born in Perth, Western Australia, to parents from Bayswater and Guildford. During her early childhood, she travelled throughout rural Western Australia with her parents and three sisters- Julie, Karina, and Tania. She has three nephews Adam, Thomas, and Michael, as well as four nieces Lauren, Jess, Emily, and Amy. In her teenage years, she lived at the Swanleigh Residential College in Middle Swan, and attended Lockridge Senior High School. She went on to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree majoring in English, at the University of Western Australia.

In 1999, Jackson was included on the honour roll celebrating the centenary of women&#x27;s suffrage in Western Australia.

Jackson is married and, together with her husband John, they live in Gooseberry Hill. She has two stepchildren.

==Career==
After graduating from university, she was the women&#x27;s officer of the Western Australian Trades and Labor Council. For the 15 years prior to her entry into politics, she was, firstly, the Industrial Officer, and later the Assistant State Secretary of the Miscellaneous Workers&#x27; Union.

===Political career===
After being overlooked by the Richard Court-led State Coalition Government for a posting as Commissioner of the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission, in mid-2000 Jackson resolved to run for Federal Parliament.

After the electoral redistribution which created the Division of Hasluck for the 2001 Australian Federal election, the electorate was notionally held by Labor with a margin of 2.55 per cent. In the election, Jackson polled a lower primary vote than Liberal contender Bethwyn Chan, but won the seat after a distribution of minor party preferences gave her a margin of 1.8 per cent.

In 2004, Jackson was vocal in her criticism of Deckers Outdoor Corporation&#x27;s campaign to enforce trademarks on the generic term &quot;ugg boot&quot;, and helped to establish a successful fighting fund to challenge their trademarks. During her first term in office Jackson also campaigned for the establishment of a university in the eastern suburbs of Perth, an area that was not served by university.

At the 2004 Federal election, Jackson faced a challenge from first-time election candidate Stuart Henry. During the election campaign, Henry&#x27;s electoral team sent campaign materials to households in the electorate in which Henry was described as &quot;Member for Hasluck&quot;, sparking complaints to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) by the WA Labor Party. Jackson said it was part of a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign by Henry, even though the AEC concluded that the letters were not directly misleading. Jackson was defeated by Henry.

===Post political career===
Following her defeat in the 2004 election, Jackson worked as Chief of Staff for State MP Bob Kucera, who was the Minister for Sport and Recreation.

Jackson was appointed by Western Australian Premier Alan Carpenter as Director of the &quot;Community Cabinet and Liaison Unit&quot;, part of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, in May 2005. Her employment in this role drew criticism, since the job was not advertised and the role was already being filled by other public servants. It was also a controversial appointment because she kept her 120,000 salary as a Ministerial Chief of Staff and the unit&#x27;s primary role was as a &quot;propaganda machine&quot; creating promotional material for Government members but not for other members.

She was elected as Western Australian State President of the Australian Labor Party in November 2005, defeating Sarah Burke in a tight contest. She took over this position from Michelle Roberts, a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. Jackson, a member of Labor&#x27;s Socialist Left faction, signaled that she intended to bridge the widening divisions between the different factions within the State Labor Party. Jackson was re-elected State President in June 2006, again defeating Burke.

After initially considering running for the Division of Brand in the forthcoming 2007 Federal election to replace outgoing member Kim Beazley, Jackson announced in January 2007 that she intended to once again seek Labor Party endorsement for the seat of Hasluck. She also signalled her intention to resign as State President of Labor if she gained endorsement. Silvia Barzotto, from Labor&#x27;s &quot;New Right&quot; faction also nominated, and Jackson was successful. Jackson resigned from her position within the Department of Premier and Cabinet in March 2007, and Sally Talbot succeeded Jackson as State Labor President in June 2007.

===Re-election into federal parliament===
Jackson was a successful candidate at the 2007 federal election, regaining her former seat of Hasluck. Jackson was probably aided in her campaign by voter discontent relating to a Government decision to allow the construction of a brick works in the electorate, against the wishes of the sitting member, Stuart Henry. Mirroring an election promise made by John Howard when he was visiting the electorate the previous week, Jackson announced that Labor would undertake major roads funding in Hasluck, including the construction of a grade-separated interchange at Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, to cost $48 million. , Jackson had not met this election promise.

At the 2010 federal election it took several days to determine an outcome in the seat of Hasluck as the result was very close. Ken Wyatt claimed victory in the seat on 29 August, with over 900 votes ahead on a two-party preferred basis.

<doc id="568829" wikidata="Q41158" url="?curid=568829" title="Cortina d'Ampezzo">
<text>Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo (; , ; historical ) sometimes abbreviated to simply Cortina, is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the heart of the southern (Dolomitic) Alps in the province of Belluno, in the Veneto region of Northern Italy. Situated on the Boite river, in an alpine valley, it is an upscale summer and winter sport resort known for its skiing trails, scenery, accommodation, shops and après-ski scene, and for its jet set and Italian aristocratic crowd.

In the Middle Ages, Ampezzo fell under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia and of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1420 it was conquered by the Republic of Venice. From 1508, it then spent much of its history under Habsburg rule, briefly undergoing some territorial changes under Napoleon, before being returned to the Austrian Empire (later Austria-Hungary), which held it until 1918. From the nineteenth century, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo became a notable regional centre for crafts. The local handmade products were appreciated by early British and German holidaymakers as tourism emerged in the late nineteenth century. Among the specializations of the town were crafting wood for furniture, the production of tiled stoves, and iron, copper and glass items. 

Today, the local economy thrives on tourism, particularly during the winter season, when the population of the town typically increases from about 7,000 to 40,000. The Basilica Minore dei Santi Filippo e Giacomo was built between 1769 and 1775 on the site of two former thirteenth and sixteenth-century churches; it is home to the parish and the deanery of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. The town also contains the Rinaldo Zardini Palaeontology Museum, established in 1975, the Mario Rimoldi Modern Art Museum, and the Regole of Ampezzo Ethnographic Museum. 

Although Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was unable to go ahead with the scheduled 1944 Winter Olympics because of World War II, it hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956 and subsequently a number of world winter-sports events. Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo will host the Winter Olympics for a second time when it co-hosts the 2026 Winter Olympics with Milan. The town is home to SG Cortina, a top league professional ice hockey team, and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is also the start and end point of the annual Dolomites Gold Cup Race. 

Several films have been shot in the town, most notably &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), and &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; (1993).

==History==

===Prehistory===
The discovery in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora high up in the mountains to the south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic humans in the area as far back as the 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession it remained until the early 5th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Raeti and Veneti people, giving the area the name of &quot;Amplitium&quot; (from &quot;amplus&quot; meaning wide), today&#x27;s Ampezzo.

===Middle Ages to 19th century===
No historical information exists on the Cadore region from the fall of the Roman Empire until the Lombard period. It is assumed that during the Barbarian invasions, the inhabitants fled to the Fassa, Badia, Cordevole and Ampezzo valleys.

In the Middle Ages, Ampezzo fell under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Aquileia and of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1420, the village was conquered by the Republic of Venice. In 1508 it was conquered by the Habsburgs, and by 1511 people of Ampezzo swore loyalty to the Emperor Maximilian, and that area was subsequently adjoined to the region of Pusterthal. In 1797, when the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed, Napoleon initially permitted the Habsburg Empire to retain it, but in 1810 he added Ampezzo to the Department of Piave, following an attack on the town in which it was burned by the French. It was short-lived; the Austrian Empire reclaimed it in 1813, and it remained in its possession even after the battles of Custoza and Sadowa in 1866 when Venice was ceded to Italy. The town gained a reputation as a health resort; it was reportedly free of diseases such as cholera.

In 1874 the Ampezzo forest became the property of the Carnic Woods Consortium. Although remaining an Austrian possession until 1920 (as a part of &quot;kronland&quot; Tyrol), aside from being home for an ethnic German-speaking minority, Ampezzo never became a German-speaking territory and conserved its original language Ladin, a Rhaeto-Romance language.

===20th century===

When Italy entered World War I in 1915, most of the male inhabitants were fighting for Austria-Hungary on the Russian front. 669 male inhabitants (most of them under 16 or over 50) tried to fight the Italian troops. Outnumbered by the Italians, they had to retreat. After the Austrian recovery in 1917, the town was occupied again by the Tyrolean &quot;Standschützen&quot;. On 24 November 1917, the Habsburg Emperor Charles (Karl) traveled through Ampezzo and was received with enthusiasm by the population. A little girl handed the emperor a letter with the request to send her father home from the front because his wife and mother of nine children had died. After ten days, Bepe Manaigo was with his children. A total of 144 Ampezzans died as a result of the war. Ampezzo soldiers received 16 silver and 4 bronze medals for bravery. In the surrounding area of the town there were 38 military cemeteries, everywhere trenches, barbed wire, impact holes, splinters, ammunition and barracks; 2,450 hectares of forest were devastated.

The mountains surrounding Cortina were themselves the theatre of several battles during the Great War. 

Following Italy&#x27;s victory in World War I, Ampezzo was (together with the central and southern part of Tyrol) definitively ceded to Italy in 1920. Three years later, it was separated from Tyrol (along with Colle Santa Lucia and Livinallongo del Col di Lana) and incorporated into the province of Belluno, itself part of the Veneto region.

After the war the city was renamed &quot;Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo&quot; (Curtain of the Ampezzo Valley), adopting the name of one of the six villages that made up the territory of Ampezzo, located in the middle of the Ampezzo valley.

Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was designated as a major redoubt and held a large ammunition storage depot (46°36&#x27;50&quot;N / 12°09&#x27;27&quot;E). In 1945 it was assigned as a holdout by Italian and German troops to prevent the Americans and British from advancing into Austria. The town and the depot were scheduled to be attacked on 26 April 1945. Only last-minute weather prevented this strike by the 15th AF / 49th BW.

Already an elite destination for the first British tourists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, after World War I Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo became a resort for upper-class Italians, too. Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo was chosen as the venue of the winter Olympics, which did not take place due to World War II. Thanks to finally hosting the winter Olympics in 1956, Cortina grew into a world-famous resort, with a substantial increase in tourism. With a resident population of 6,150 people in 2008, Cortina has a temporary population of around 50,000 during peak periods such as the Christmas holidays and mid-August. The Ford Cortina, the UK&#x27;s best-selling car of the 1970s, was named after Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.

===21st-century politics===
In 2002 the Ampezzaner rifle company Ŝizar Anpezo Hayden was brought back to life. Since Otto von Habsburg, the then head of the Habsburg family, visited Cortina in 2005, their patron has been Charles I of Austria. Especially because of the eventful history, the Habsburg brand is still very present in Cortina in the 21st century, as many pictures and photos of Franz Joseph I of Austria and of Charles I, who is particularly revered here, in inns, restaurants, bars and hotels testify. Since 2011 there has been a memorial for Maximilian I on the main square in memory of the year 1511 and the union of the Ampezzo valley basin with Tyrol.

The town voted in October 2007 to secede from the region of Veneto and join the neighbouring region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This was motivated by cultural ties with the Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive, and a final decision on the matter can only be made by law from the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.

In the European elections of 2014, the leading party was the Democratic Party with 30.4% of the vote, followed by (19.4%) and the autonomist Südtiroler Volkspartei with 14.1%.

==Geography and climate==

Cortina is situated more or less in the centre of the Ampezzo valley, at the top of the Valle del Boite in the Dolomites, which encircle the town. The Boite river flows directly through the town of Cortina itself. The mountains in the area are described as &quot;craggy&quot; and &quot;soaring&quot;, &quot;unmistakable; like a massive coral reef ripped from the sea, strung with conifers and laced with snow&quot;. The town is positioned between Cadore (to the south) and the Puster Valley (to the north), Val d&#x27;Ansiei (to the east) and Agordo (to the west). Originally it consisted of numerous &quot;frazioni&quot;, isolated villages and hamlets, but from the 1950s it grew rapidly as a result of tourism. Only the most remote villages have remained isolated from the main town. San Vito di Cadore is to the south of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.

Among the surrounding mountains are Tofane to the west, Pomagagnon to the north, Cristallo to the northeast, Faloria and Sorapiss to the east, and Becco di Mezzodì, Croda da Lago and Cinque Torri to the south. Monte Antelao (Nantelou in Ladin) is at 3264 m the highest mountain in the Ampezzo Dolomites and the second highest in the Dolomites. When the weather is good, Monte Antelao is clearly visible from the rive in Trieste on the Adriatic Sea. The town centre is located at an elevation of , the closest high peak is that of Tofana di Mezzo, which towers at . There are numerous fast flowing rivers, streams and small lakes in the territory, such as the &quot;Ghedina&quot;, &quot;Pianozes&quot; and &quot;d&#x27;Ajal&quot;, which fill particularly during the summer snow-melt season. Fauna include marmots, roe deer, chamois and hares and, on occasion, wolves, bears and lynx. Much of the area of Cortina is part of the &quot;Natural Park of the Ampezzo Dolomites&quot;.

===&quot;Frazioni&quot;===
The comune contains the following &quot;frazioni&quot; (parishes/wards) with their Ladino names in parentheses: Acquabona (Agabòna), Alverà, Bigontina (Begontina), Cadelverzo (Cadelvèrzo), Cademai, Cadin (Ciadìn), Campo (Ciànpo), Chiamulera (Ciamulèra), Chiave (Ciàe), Cianderìes, Coiana (Cojana), Col, Cortina, Crìgnes, Doneà, Fiames (Fiàmes), Fraìna, Gilardon (Jilardòn), Gnòche o Gràa, Guargné, Lacedel (Lazedèl), Manaigo, Majon, Melères, Mortisa (Mortìja), Pecol (Pecòl), Pezié, Pian da Lago, Pocol (Pocòl), Rònco, Salieto, Socol, Staulin (Staulìn), Val, Verocai, Vera (Vèra), Zuel (Zuèl).

===Climate===
Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo has a cold alpine humid continental climate, close to a taiga climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dclo&quot;), with short, mild summers and long, freezing cold winters that vacillate between frigid, snowy, unsettled, and temperate. In late December and early January, some of Italy&#x27;s lowest recorded temperatures are to be found in the region, especially at the top of the Cimabanche Pass on the border between the provinces of Belluno and Bolzano. The other seasons are generally rainy, cool to warm, and windy. During the summer, temperatures can reach 25°C.

==Demographics==
Cortina&#x27;s population grew steadily from the time when it was annexed to the Italian State until the 1960s. Thereafter, it underwent a sharp decline (down by 2,099 inhabitants over a 30-year period), with signs of recovery only in the very last few years. Nevertheless, with 6,112 inhabitants, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is the seventh most populous place in the province following Belluno (36,509), Feltre (20,688), Sedico (9,734), Ponte nelle Alpi (8,521), Santa Giustina (6,795) and Mel (6,272). In 2008, there were 44 births (7.1 ‰) and 67 deaths (10.9%), resulting in an overall reduction of 23 inhabitants (−3.8 ‰). The town&#x27;s 2,808 families consisted on average of 2.2 persons.

The presence of foreign residents in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is a fairly recent phenomenon, accounting for only a small number of inhabitants in what in any case is a fairly small town. There are 298 resident foreigners in the town, representing 4.9% of the total population. This compares with 7.0% in the town Belluno, 6.4% in the entire province of Belluno, and 10.2% in the Veneto region.

===Language and dialects===
In addition to Italian, the majority of the population speak fluent Ampezzano, a local variant of Ladin, now recognized as a language rather than a dialect. Ladin is a Rhaeto-Romance language and closely resembles Romansh, which is spoken in Switzerland. The preservation of the local language, as a living medium used by younger generations, is seen as a symbol of pride and attachment to local heritage. Ladin and Tyrolean culture continues to survive despite the increasing pressure faced in recent years. Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages in compliance with regulations for the protection of linguistic minorities in force since 1999.

==Economy==

Beginning in the 19th century, Ampezzo became a notable regional centre for crafts. The growing importance of this sector led the Austrian Ministry of Commerce to authorize the opening of a State Industrial School in 1874, which later became the Art Institute. It became a reputable institution in teaching wood and metalwork, admitting boys from the age of 13 for up to four years of study. The local handmade products were appreciated by early British and German vacationers as tourism emerged in the late 19th century. Some of the local items were said to have mythical qualities; the Austrian journalist and anthropologist Karl Felix Wolff, for example, stated in 1935 that according to legend a local man &quot;once made a sword that was so flexible that you could bend it over, tie it up, and then allow it to straighten out again&quot;. Among the specializations of the town were crafting wood for furniture; the production of tiled stoves; and iron, copper, and glass items.
Today the local economy thrives on tourism, particularly during the winter season, when the population of the town typically increases from about 7,000 to 40,000. Lonely Planet refers to Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo as &quot;one of Italy&#x27;s most famous, fashionable and expensive ski resorts&quot;, which &quot;boasts first-class facilities (skiing, skating, sledding, climbing) and superb hiking&quot;.

Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is home to some of the most prestigious names in fashion (including Bulgari, Benetton, Gucci, and Geox) and various artisan shops, antiquarians, and craft stores. It is also home to many stores specializing in mountaineering equipment. The symbol of Cortina shopping remains &quot;La Cooperativa di Cortina&quot;, founded on 28 June 1893 as &quot;Consumverein Ampezzo&quot;. In this shopping centre many trades can be found, from confectioners to newspaper vendors, toys, gift shops, skiing stores, and blacksmiths. The building is divided into three levels (more a raised plan and a balcony). The cooperative in Cortina was one of the first cooperatives founded in the Italian Peninsula and currently provides employment to approximately 200 people.

The five-star Miramonti Majestic Grand Hotel, of James Bond fame, is more than 100 years old. Previously an Austro-Hungarian hunting lodge, it contains 105 rooms. Other hotels of note include Hotel Cornelio on Via Cantore, Hotel Montana on Corso Italia, Hotel Menardi on Via Majom, Hotel Villa Gaiai on Via Guide Alpine, and the Grand Hotel Savoia on Via Roma. There are several mountain hostels in the vicinity, including Rifugio Faloria, Rifugio son Forca, Rifugio Capanna Tondi and Rifugio duca d&#x27;Aosta, which contains restaurants.

==Landmarks==

Near the bridge on the Bigontina River is the Town Hall, a palace in the Tyrolean style. &quot;Piazza Angelo Dibona&quot; houses several landmarks. The &quot;Ciasa de ra Regoles&quot; is one of the more important legal buildings in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, where the &quot;regolieri&quot; — a council for the local villages that stood before the town merged — train the community and give administrative orders. It was at one time the see of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo&#x27;s primary school. Currently it contains the offices of Comunanza delle Regole d&#x27;Ampezzo and the Modern Art Museum &quot;Mario Rimoldi&quot;. The main square of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is named after the famous local mountain guide Angelo Dibona.

===Museums===
The Regole d&#x27;Ampezzo administer the Musei delle Regole d&#x27;Ampezzo, which covers three museums: 
Rinaldo Zardini Palaeontology Museum, Regole of Ampezzo Ethnographic Museum, and Mario Rimoldi Modern Art Museum.

The Rinaldo Zardini Palaeontology Museum, established in 1975, is a paleontological museum with a collection of hundreds of fossils of all colors, shapes, and sizes, which were found, gathered, and cataloged by local photographer Rinaldo Zardini. All of the pieces were found in the Dolomites and tell of a time when these high mountain peaks were still on the bottom of a large tropical sea, populated by marine invertebrates, fish, corals, and sponges. 

The Regole of Ampezzo Ethnographic Museum is an ethnographic museum situated in an old restored Venetian sawmill at the confluence of the Boite and Felizon rivers to the north of the town. There are objects related to everyday life, rural, and pastoral practices in the vicinity; agricultural tools; techniques; materials processing; and clothing typical of the valley. 

The Mario Rimoldi Modern Art Museum is an art gallery, established in 1941, which preserves over 800 works by major Italian artists of the 20th century including Filippo De Pisis, Felice Carena, Pio Semeghini, Renato Guttuso, Tullio Garbari, Massimo Campigli, and many others. It also hosts temporary exhibitions on various topics.

The Great War Tour stretches over across the mountains between Lagazuoi and Sass de Stria. It includes the Great War Open Air Museum with its trenches and tunnels. In winter it is accessible to skiers, but it is easier to visit on foot or by mountain bike in the summer months.

===Churches===

The Basilica Minore dei Santi Filippo e Giacomo was built between 1769 and 1775 on the site of two former 13th and 16th-century churches; it is home to the parish and the deanery of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. Its high wooden altar, crowned by a figure of Christ the Redeemer, was carved by Andrea Brustolon. On the ceiling are three frescoes by Luigi Ghedina: &quot;Christ Purifying the Temple&quot;, &quot;The Martyrdom of St. Philip&quot;, and &quot;The Beheading of St. James&quot;.

The Chiesa della Madonna della Difesa was built in 1750 on the site of a ruined 14th-century building. Its façade features an intricate fresco depicting the Madonna della Difesa, and the interior is decorated with a wealth of statues, paintings, polychrome marble, and gold leaf. 

The Cappella della Beata Vergine di Lourdes (Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes) was completed in 1907. Decorated by artist Corrado Pitscheider of the Val Gardena, it is a small church of particular interest given the reconstruction sculpture. 

The Cappella di Sant&#x27;Antonio da Padova in the village of Chiave was completed in 1791, but the interior was renovated in 1809 after serious fire damage caused by the Napoleonic troops. The furnishings include two wooden busts of Christ and St. Catherine as well as a richly designed altar. 

Sacrario militare di Pocol (also known as Ossario di Pocol) is a cemetery and shrine located at an altitude of towards Passo Falzarego, in the locality of Pocol. The small church and cemetery were built in 1916 as a military cemetery by the 5th Alpine group. A shrine was built in 1935 as a memorial to the thousands who lost their lives during World War I on the Dolomite front. It is a massive square tower of stone, clearly visible from the entire Ampezzo valley below. In a crypt in the centre of the structure rests the body of general Antonio Cantore, who was awarded the gold medal for military valor.

===Castles and forts===

The Castello de Zanna is a small fortress, situated in the &quot;vila&quot; of Minel. It consists of low, white outer walls and two white corner towers, with a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The construction of the castle began in 1694, but on 19 August 1696 work was interrupted; the building remained unfinished in 1809 when it was burned by French revolutionary troops who had invaded Ampezzo. Since then the castle has undergone restoration.

Forte Tre Sassi (or Forte Tra i Sassi) is a fortress constructed in 1897 during the Austro-Hungarian period on the Passo Valparola. It lies between Sass de Stria and Piccolo Lagazuoi, dominating the passage between the Passo Falzarego and Val Badia in South Tyrol (Alto Adige). It was part of the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian border in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Rendered unusable due to a bombing by the Italians on 5 July 1915, the ruins remained in a state of disrepair until the advent of the 21st century, when it was restored by the local administration of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo with the assistance of the Lacedelli family. The fort houses a museum containing relics related to the First World War.

Castello di Botestagno (also known as Podestagno) was a medieval fort perched on a rock in the valley of the river Boite, a little farther north of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo. It is believed that it was first erected as a stakeout during conflict with the Lombards between the 7th and 8th centuries, with the aim of dominating the three valleys that converge beneath it: the Boite, the Val di Fanes, and the Val Felizon. The cornerstone, however, probably dates to the 11th century. It was held by the Germans until 1077, and then by the patriarchs of Aquileia (12th century) and Camino (13th century), until Botestagno became the seat of a captaincy. It then passed into Venetian hands and finally to the Habsburgs. During the 18th century the castle gradually lost importance until it was auctioned in 1782 by order of Emperor Joseph II. Today the fort has now almost completely disappeared; only the remnants of what must have been the wine cellars and the foundations remain, now weathered and largely covered up by vegetation.

==Culture==
Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo has a long tradition in hosting writers, intellectuals, poets and editors from all over the world. Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow, Dino Buzzati, Vittorio Gassman, Leonardo Sciascia, Leonardo Mondadori and many others, spent their vacations in the town and took part in the cultural life of the city. Through the years, this led to a continuous activity of literature festivals and book presentations, like Una Montagna di Libri (&quot;A Mountain of Books&quot;), held twice a year since 2009. The festival attracted to Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo writers as Azar Nafisi, Peter Cameron and Emmanuel Carrère.

Music is important to the locals of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, with a guitar found in most houses, and young musicians are often found walking the streets. Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world&#x27;s leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo&#x27;s own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.

After Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s wife Hadley lost a suitcase filled with Hemingway&#x27;s manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon in Paris, he took a time off. He began writing that same year in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, writing &quot;Out of Season&quot;.

The dominant religion in the comune of Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo is Roman Catholicism. Among the religious minorities, mainly a result of recent immigration, there is a small community of Eastern Orthodox Christians and Muslims. There is also a congregation of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, which has its headquarters in Pian da Lago.

The surroundings of Cortina have been the location for a number of movies, including mountain climbing scenes for &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, &quot;Krull&quot; and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. The resort was the primary area for location shooting in Sergio Corbucci&#x27;s Revisionist Spaghetti Western &quot;The Great Silence&quot;; the resort was used to represent Utah in the winter of 1898. It was a glamorous location for Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; (1973), and was also a major location for the 1981 James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. Roger Moore&#x27;s James Bond meets the character Luigi Ferrara (John Moreno) at the peak of Tofana and stays at the Hotel Miramonti. A number of action sequences were shot in the town involving Bond and Erich Kriegler (John Wyman), as Kriegler competes in the biathlon. The battle culminates in one of the famous ski chase sequences in film, where Bond has to escape Kriegler and a crew of assassins on a spike-wheeled motorcycles, his route taking them all onto the bobsleigh run. The actual town centre was also the scene of the first attack on Bond and his partner Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) by two motorcyclists who attempted to run them over, only for Bond to kill them both, putting one of them through the window of a local florist. The town was the setting of the 1919 silent film &quot;Blind Husbands&quot;, directed by Erich von Stroheim.

<text>The black-capped kingfisher (Halcyon pileata) is a tree kingfisher which is widely distributed in tropical Asia from India east to China, Korea and Southeast Asia. This most northerly of the tree kingfishers is resident over much of its range, but northern populations are migratory, wintering south of their range in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Borneo and Java. It is distinctive in having a black cap that contrasts with the whitish throat, purple-blue wings and the coral red bill. The species is mainly found in coastal and mangrove habitats but can sometimes be found far inland.

==Taxonomy==
The black-capped kingfisher was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1780. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;, which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name, but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Alcedo pileata&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is China. The present genus &quot;Halcyon&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William Swainson in 1821. &quot;Halcyon&quot; is a name for a bird in Greek mythology generally associated with the kingfisher. The specific epithet &quot;pileata&quot; is from the Latin &quot;pileatus&quot; meaning &#x27;-capped&#x27;. The species is monotypic.

== Description ==

This kingfisher is about long. The adult has purple-blue wings and back, black head and shoulders, white neck collar and throat, and rufous underparts. The large bill and legs are bright red. In flight, large white patches or &quot;mirrors&quot; at the base of the primaries are visible on the blue and black wings. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are a duller version of the adult and show streaks on the throat. The call of this kingfisher is a cackling &quot;ki-ki-ki-ki-ki&quot;.

Usually seen on coastal waters and especially in mangroves, it is easily disturbed. It perches conspicuously and dives to catch fish, and also feeds on large insects. The flight of the black-capped kingfisher is rapid and direct, the short rounded wings whirring.

The breeding season is in summer. The nest is a tunnel in an earth bank. A single clutch of 4-5 round, white eggs is typical.

A subspecies &quot;palawanensis&quot; has been described, but the species is considered to be monotypic with no clear plumage differences across its range.

==Distribution and habitat ==

The species is found mainly near the coast in mangrove forests and along estuaries and rivers. The distribution ranges from India (including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where they occur even on remote islands like Narcondam), Sri Lanka, Kansu, Shansi, Korea, Malay Peninsula, Thailand, Burma, Ryukyu Islands, Bangladesh, Hainan, Philippines (Palawan, Balabac, Basilan, Tawi Tawi), Borneo, Sumatra east to Sulawesi where it occurs only in winter. Vagrants in winter have been recorded in Pakistan, while movements related to rainfall may lead to their being found far inland and away from their usual distribution.

== In culture ==
Like many other kingfishers, this species was much sought for the blue feathers for their use in the millinery trade. Feathers were used in making fans in China. In Hong Kong, their feathers were cut and glued over ornaments used by women.

<text>Henry Alfred &quot;Harry&quot; Jenkins, (born 18 August 1952) is an Australian former politician who served as the 26th speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 2008 to 2011. A member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), he was the member of parliament (MP) for the division of Scullin from 1986 until his resignation in 2013.

==Early life==
Jenkins was born in Melbourne on 18 August 1952. He was the oldest of four children born to Hazel &quot;Wendy&quot; Winter and Henry Alfred Jenkins. His father, a physician, was elected to the House of Representatives in 1969.

Jenkins attended Ivanhoe Grammar School. He studied medicine at the University of Melbourne for three years, before switching to the Australian National University (ANU) where he completed a Bachelor of Science in 1976 with concentrations in human ecology, biology and biochemistry. After graduating he began working as an estimates officer with the Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs. He was elected to the Whittlesea Shire Council in 1976 and served as shire president from 1984 to 1985.

==Politics==
Jenkins was president of the ALP&#x27;s Bundoora branch in the 1980s. In 1985, his father resigned as Speaker to take up as an appointment as ambassador to Spain. Aged 33, Jenkins won ALP preselection for the resulting 1986 Scullin by-election ahead of former Casey MP Peter Steedman and future state government minister Theo Theophanous. He was described by the &quot;Canberra Times&quot; as &quot;chosen as a compromise candidate by the old and new guards of Victoria&#x27;s Socialist Left faction&quot;.

Jenkins was Deputy Speaker 1993–1996 and Second Deputy Speaker from 1996 to his election as Speaker in 2008. He was the Opposition candidate for Speaker after the 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections.

===42nd Parliament===
He was elected by Labor caucus on 29 November 2007 to become the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the 42nd Parliament. This was carried by a formal vote on 12 February 2008. He succeeded Liberal incumbent David Hawker. Although Speakers normally carry the courtesy title while in office &#x27;the Honourable&#x27;, Jenkins said his personal preference was that it not be used.

He is the first speaker whose parent also held the post.

===43rd Parliament===
The Labor Party renominated Jenkins as Speaker in the 43rd Parliament, and he was elected unopposed when the Parliament opened on 28 September 2010.

On 31 May 2011, after a contentious debate on carbon pricing in which Jenkins declared a &quot;general warning&quot; for all members, Liberal MP Bob Baldwin interjected and was named by Jenkins. Baldwin was supported by the Coalition and by independent member Rob Oakeshott and West Australian National member Tony Crook. The resulting vote on suspending Baldwin for 24 hours failed 71–72. Convention would normally have required Jenkins to resign as Speaker, but the House of Representatives immediately thereafter approved a motion of confidence in the Speaker and he remained in the position.

He resigned as the Speaker of the House of Representatives on 24 November 2011, stating, &quot;My desire is to be able to participate in policy and parliamentary debate, and this would be incompatible with continuing in the role of Speaker.&quot;

Jenkins retired from politics at the 2013 election.

<doc id="568843" wikidata="Q412143" url="?curid=568843" title="Triazolam">
<text>Triazolam, sold under the brand name Halcion among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant tranquilizer of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepine (BZD) derivatives. It possesses pharmacological properties similar to those of other benzodiazepines, but it is generally only used as a sedative to treat severe insomnia. In addition to the hypnotic properties, triazolam&#x27;s amnesic, anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties are pronounced as well.
Triazolam was initially patented in 1970 and went on sale in the United States in 1982. In 2017, it was the 289th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Triazolam is usually used for short-term treatment of acute insomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including jet lag. It is an ideal benzodiazepine for this use because of its fast onset of action and short half-life. It puts a person to sleep for about 1.5 hours, allowing its user to avoid morning drowsiness. Triazolam is also sometimes used as an adjuvant in medical procedures requiring anesthesia or to reduce anxiety during brief events, such as MRI scans and nonsurgical dental procedures. Triazolam is ineffective in maintaining sleep due to its short half-life, with quazepam showing superiority.

Triazolam is frequently prescribed as a sleep aid for passengers travelling on short- to medium-duration flights. If this use is contemplated, the user avoiding the consumption of alcohol is especially important, as is trying a ground-based &quot;rehearsal&quot; of the medication to ensure that the side effects and potency of this medication are understood by the user prior to using it in a relatively more public environment (as disinhibition can be a common side effect, with potentially severe consequences). Triazolam causes anterograde amnesia, which is why so many dentists administer it to patients undergoing even minor dental procedures. This practice is known as sedation dentistry.

==Side effects==
Adverse drug reactions associated with the use of triazolam include:

* Relatively common (&gt;1% of patients): somnolence, dizziness, lightheadedness, coordination problems
* Less common (0.9% to 0.5% of patients): euphoria, tachycardia, fatigue, delirium, memory impairment, cramps/pain, depression, visual disturbances
* Rare (&lt;0.5% of patients): constipation, taste alteration, diarrhea, dry mouth, dermatitis/allergy, abnormal dreams or nightmares, insomnia (paradoxical), paresthesia, tinnitus, dysesthesia, weakness, nasal/sinus congestion

Triazolam, although a short-acting benzodiazepine, may cause residual impairment into the next day, especially the next morning. A meta-analysis demonstrated that residual &quot;hangover&quot; effects after nighttime administration of triazolam such as sleepiness, psychomotor impairment, and diminished cognitive functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Confusion and amnesia have been reported.

In September 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning be updated for all benzodiazepine medicines to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.

===Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal===

A review of the literature found that long-term use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, is associated with drug tolerance, drug dependence, rebound insomnia, and CNS-related adverse effects. Benzodiazepine hypnotics should be used at their lowest possible dose and for a short period of time. Nonpharmacological treatment options were found to yield sustained improvements in sleep quality. A worsening of insomnia (rebound insomnia) compared to baseline may occur after discontinuation of triazolam, even following short-term, single-dose therapy.

Other withdrawal symptoms can range from mild unpleasant feelings to a major withdrawal syndrome, including stomach cramps, vomiting, muscle cramps, sweating, tremor, and in rare cases, convulsions.

===Contraindications===
Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcoholics, or in other drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Triazolam belongs to the Pregnancy Category X of the FDA. It is known to have the potential to cause birth defects.

===Elderly===
Triazolam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Daytime withdrawal effects can occur.

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found considerable evidence of the effectiveness and durability of nondrug treatments for insomnia in adults of all ages and that these interventions are underused. Compared with the benzodiazepines including triazolam, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics appeared to offer few, if any, significant clinical advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents with novel mechanisms of action and improved safety profiles, such as the melatonin agonists, hold promise for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and has traditionally been discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment, anterograde amnesia, daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. One study found no evidence of sustained hypnotic efficacy throughout the 9 weeks of treatment for triazolam.

In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of these agents remain to be determined. More research is needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment and the most appropriate management strategy for elderly persons with chronic insomnia.

== Interactions ==

Ketoconazole and itraconazole have a profound effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, nefazodone, rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (Atripla).

==Overdose==

Symptoms of an overdose include:
* Coma
* Hypoventilation (respiratory depression)
* Somnolence (drowsiness)
* Slurred speech
* Seizures

Death can occur from triazolam overdose, but is more likely to occur in combination with other depressant drugs such as opioids, alcohol, or tricyclic antidepressants.

==Pharmacology==
Like other benzodiazepines, triazolam enhances the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA by binding to the allosteric benzodiazepine receptor on GABAA receptor complexes.

Triazolam is short-acting, is lipophilic, and is metabolized hepatically via oxidative pathways. Triazolam produces one short-acting active metabolite, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, which is suspected to be of minor clinical significance. The half-life of triazolam is only 2 hours making it a very short acting benzodiazepine drug. It has anticonvulsant effects on brain function.

==Society and culture==

===Recreational use===

Triazolam, like other benzodiazepines, is susceptible to misuse and abuse. Its rapid onset of action and short half life contribute to its abuse potential, but its relative obscurity compared to other fast-acting benzodiazepines (such as alprazolam or lorazepam) prevent its abuse from becoming particularly commonplace. Likewise, because it is not prescribed as often or as readily as alprazolam or lorazepam, there is less triazolam available to be diverted for recreational use.

===Legal status===
Its use at low doses has been deemed acceptable by the US FDA and in several other countries.

Triazolam is a Schedule IV drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the US Controlled Substances Act.

===Brand names===
The drug is marketed in English-speaking countries under the brand names Apo-Triazo, Halcion, Hypam, and Trilam. Other names include 2&#x27;-chloroxanax, chloroxanax, triclazolam, and chlorotriazolam.

It is the location of the provincial capital of Pangkal Pinang, and is administratively divided into four regencies and a city. The island itself and the surrounding sea suffers considerable environmental damage from its thriving tin mining industry which operates on- and offshore.

==Geography==
Bangka is the largest landmass of the province of the Bangka Belitung Islands. It lies just east of Sumatra, separated by the Bangka Strait; to the north lies the South China Sea, to the east, across the Gaspar Strait, is the island of Belitung, and to the south is the Java Sea. It is about 11,831 km2 in area (including offshore islands). Most of its geography consists of lower plains, swamps, small hills, and beautiful beaches. It has white pepper fields, many palm trees and rubber trees, and well-known tin mines.

The island&#x27;s largest city, Pangkal Pinang, is also the capital and largest city of the province. The town of Sungai Liat is its second-largest settlement. Mentok (formerly Muntok) is the principal port in the west. Other important towns are Toboali in the southern region; Koba, an important tin-mining town, also in the southern part of the island; and Belinyu, which is famous for its seafood products. Bangka has four seaports: Mentok, in the far west; Belinyu, in the far north; Sadai, in the far south; and Pangkal Balam, in Pangkal Pinang, where the government is contemplating the construction of a nuclear power station.
The population was 626,955 in 1990, 960,692 at the 2010 census and 1,146,581 at the 2020 census; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,191,300. The area is (including smaller offshore islands).

==History==
During the glacial periods, Bangka was connected to mainland Asia similarly with the larger islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo as part of the Sunda Shelf, and got separated once the sea level rose.

The Kota Kapur inscription, dated from 686 CE, was found in Bangka in 1920, showed Srivijayan influence on the island around the 7th century. Later, the island was conquered by an expedition from Majapahit, led by Gajah Mada, which appointed local rulers and established social structures. As the empire declined, Bangka fell into neglect.

Bangka was recorded as Peng-ka hill (彭加山) in the 1436 Xingcha Shenglan, compiled by the Chinese soldier Fei Xin during the treasure voyages of Admiral Zheng He. Contemporary records show that the area – close to the busy Strait of Malacca and waters of the Musi River – had significant presence of Chinese traders.

Later on, the island was taken over by the Johor and Minangkabau Sultanates which introduced Islam to the island. It continued to pass to the Banten Sultanate before it was then inherited by the nearby Palembang Sultanate sometime in the late 17th century. Soon after, around 1710, tin was discovered on the island which attracted migrants from across the archipelago and beyond. Descendants of the Chinese immigrants, mainly from Guangdong, still form a large portion of modern Bangka&#x27;s inhabitants.

As tin mining developed further, the Palembang Sultanate sent for experts in Malay Peninsula and China. The Dutch East India Company managed to secure a monopolistic tin purchase agreement in 1722, but hostilities began to develop between the Sultan and the Dutch. During the British invasion of Java in 1811, then-Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin attacked and massacred the staff of the Dutch post on the island. He was later deposed and executed by the British. His successor ceded Bangka to Britain in 1812. The British renamed this island to Duke of York Island, but in 1814 Britain exchanged it with the Dutch for Cochin in India following the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814.

Around the late years of the 18th century, Bangka was an important production center of tin in Asia, with annual outputs hovering around 1,250 tons. In 1930 Bangka had a population of 205,363. Japan occupied the island from February 1942 to August 1945 during World War II. The Japanese military perpetrated the Bangka Island massacre against Australian nurses and British and Australian servicemen and civilians.

During the Indonesian National Revolution, republican leaders Sukarno and Hatta were exiled in Bangka in the aftermath of Operation Kraai. Bangka became part of independent Indonesia in 1949. The island, together with neighboring Belitung, was formerly part of South Sumatra (Sumatera Selatan) province, but in 2000 the two islands became the new province of Bangka-Belitung. In the recent years, tin mining has declined notedly, although it is still a major part of the island&#x27;s economy.

Bangka is also home to a number of communist Indonesians who have been under house arrest since the 1960s anti-Communist purge and are not permitted to leave the island.

==Economy ==

===Tin and environmental issues ===
Since circa 1710, Bangka has been one of the world&#x27;s main tin-producing centers. Tin production is a government monopoly in Indonesia. There is a tin smelter at Muntok. Indonesia is the second-largest tin producer and exporter in the world. Indonesia&#x27;s largest tin production is produced on Bangka Island which makes it a strategic area for Indonesia in terms of world tin trade. But heavy tin exploitation caused environmental damage and much of the land suffers from infertility after being turned into (often illegal) tin mine. Irresponsible miners let the mine land become trenches filled with water and the surrounding land becomes arid with nothing to grow. This is a critical environmental issue. The watery mines peppering the island often become home to saltwater crocodiles that have been displaced from their natural mangrove habitat, and this situation has contributed to increased crocodile attacks on people.

===Other===
White pepper is also produced on the island.

==Demographics==

The majority of the inhabitants are Malays and Chinese, mostly Hakkas. The population is split between those work on the tin mines, palm oil plantations, rubber plantations, fisherman and those who work on pepper farms.

<doc id="568848" wikidata="Q6831690" url="?curid=568848" title="Michael Johnson (Australian politician)">
<text>Michael Andrew Johnson (born 31 January 1970) is a Hong Kong-born Australian former politician who was a member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Ryan in Queensland from 2001 to 2010, representing the Liberal Party from November 2001 to May 2010 and then as an independent from May 2010 until he was defeated by Liberal National member Jane Prentice at the 2010 federal election.

==Early years and education==
He was born in Hong Kong, and was educated at St. Peters Lutheran College and later at the University of Queensland, the University of Cambridge, where he obtained an MPhil, and the University of Birmingham, where he obtained an MIS. He was the Australian Chevening Scholar in 1994, the Charles Hawker Memorial Scholar in 1996 and was a 2004 graduate of Harvard Kennedy School’s Executive Leaders’ Program at Harvard.

Johnson was a barrister and a university tutor and lecturer before entering politics. He was named in 2007 as a Young Global Leader (YGL) by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum (WEF). He was Chairman of the Australia-China Business Forum, and was a Member of the Asia Society&#x27;s International Advisory Board and sits on the Australian Advisory Board.

==Political career==

In February 2001, Johnson first sought to gain Liberal endorsement for Ryan, following the retirement of long-serving member, John Moore. Factional rivalries between Johnson and other candidates for preselection led to rampant branch stacking. Johnson had been expected to win preselection, having arranged many of the new members in local branches. He was accused by opponents in the party of signing up ethnic Chinese with only limited connections to the Liberal Party, many from outside the Ryan electorate, and in at least one case, outside Australia. Unfortunately for Johnson, it was revealed he had failed to properly renounce his British citizenship and was ruled ineligible to contest preselection per Section 44 of the Australian Constitution. Former state Liberal President Bob Tucker won preselection for the by-election, losing that contest to Labor&#x27;s Leonie Short. However, by the time of the federal election in October, Johnson had sorted out his citizenship and won Liberal preselection. He then easily took the seat back from Short on an eight-point swing.

There have also been public allegations regarding internal party funds, what he describes as his &quot;unorthodox&quot; fundraising of asking businesses for fees for introductions he facilitates in his capacity as an MP, and the alleged improper use of a publicly funded vehicle.

Johnson also held the position of Opposition Whip in the federal Liberal Party from February 2008 to February 2010. He resigned from the post when allegations that he had misused his taxpayer-funded vehicle were investigated.

===Expulsion from the LNP===

In 2010, controversy emerged regarding business dealings involving Johnson and the Australia-China Business Forum, of which he was the Chair. On 20 May 2010, he was expelled from the Liberal National Party, the Queensland branch of the Liberal and National parties. Johnson vowed to contest Ryan as an independent at the 2010 federal election. In June 2010, Jane Prentice, a Brisbane City Councillor, was chosen by the LNP to stand for Ryan.

On 2 June 2010, Johnson read out a letter to Parliament which he sent to the Australian Federal Police alleging he was subject to &quot;illegal pressure&quot; to resign from Federal Parliament by the Liberal National Party President Bruce McIver, during a meeting on 25 February in Canberra. During the meeting, Johnson claimed that McIver produced a large black folder which he alleged contained material and documents that was evidence of alleged criminal behaviour by Johnson. McIver denies the claims that he asked him to resign from Parliament, though openly admits he asked Johnson to quit the LNP.

=== Independent election attempts ===

He stood unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in:
* the 2010 federal election, where he campaigned to retain his seat of Ryan after being expelled from the LNP earlier that year. He secured less than 9% of the primary vote and the seat was retaken by the LNP, with the new member being Jane Prentice.
* the 2020 Queensland state election, where he stood for the seat of Maiwar. He scored less than 1% of first preference votes, and the seat was retained by Greens MP Michael Berkman.

== Post-politics and personal life ==
Johnson lives in Brisbane&#x27;s western suburbs with his wife Huyen and their son Ryan, who was born in June 2006.

<text>Bryan Wallace Berard (born March 5, 1977) is an American former professional ice hockey defenseman. Berard was the first overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators. He is most noted for a debilitating eye injury he received early in his career. Berard underwent several operations, and played 619 games in his NHL career despite the seriousness of the injury.

==Playing career==
===Junior career===
Berard was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He began his junior career playing for Mount St. Charles Academy in Rhode Island. He won three championships with the school before departing after his third year. Berard had offers from Boston College, the University of Maine, and the University of Michigan, but chose to go the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Berard was drafted by the Detroit Junior Red Wings of the OHL. and won the OHL Championship with the team in the 1994–95 season and made the league&#x27;s first all-star team. He was also named the league&#x27;s rookie of the year, only the third defenceman to win the trophy.

===Entry draft and New York Islanders===
Berard entered the 1995 NHL entry draft as the consensus number one pick according to several pundits, and was subsequently drafted first overall by the Ottawa Senators. The Hartford Whalers, who entered the draft holding the 13th overall pick, contacted the Senators in an effort to trade for the first overall pick to select Berard, but halted their efforts when Ottawa&#x27;s asking price of Chris Pronger was deemed too high.

As the first overall pick, and with the Senators blue line among the weaker in the league, Berard anticipated going straight to the National Hockey League. However, after his first training camp with the team, he was returned to junior hockey. Concerned about his development, Berard requested a trade. In January 1996, the Senators traded Berard, Martin Straka and Don Beaupre to the New York Islanders in exchange for Wade Redden and Damian Rhodes.

Berard joined the Islanders for 1996–97 season and made an immediate impact. With 48 points in his rookie season, he led all defensemen on the team, and finished ninth league-wide in scoring amongst defensemen. He was rewarded for his efforts by winning the Calder Trophy as the top rookie in the NHL, edging out Jarome Iginla. He also played for the United States in the 1998 Winter Olympics. The team finished sixth. After three years with the Islanders, the team was concerned with his ability to play defense and were in search of a proven goaltender. The Islanders traded Berard to the Toronto Maple Leafs for goaltender Félix Potvin in January 1999.

===Toronto Maple Leafs and injury===
Berard put up 19 points in 38 games with the Maple Leafs, and played 17 more contests in the postseason. In his second year with the club, he had 30 points in 64 games when on March 11, 2000, during a game against the Senators in Ottawa, the stick of the Senators&#x27; Marián Hossa clipped Berard in the right eye on a follow through. The eye was severely slashed on the sclera which resulted in a retinal tear and a detached retina. In the hospital after the incident, after being told he might lose his eye, Berard reportedly told his friends that he would play hockey again. Despite that optimism, he received a $6.5 million settlement from his insurance company, for what many considered to be a career-ending injury.

Berard missed the 2000–01 season and underwent seven eye operations, improving his vision in the eye to 20/600. He started working out again in April 2001 and started skating again months thereafter. Berard was later fitted with a contact lens that allowed him to meet the league&#x27;s minimum vision requirement of 20/400. He became an unrestricted free agent in 2001.

===Free agency===
When it became apparent that he might play again, the Maple Leafs stated they were interested in his services, but Berard opted to play for a team that was currently rebuilding and was a bit closer to his home of Woonsocket. Upon signing a tryout contract with the New York Rangers, he returned his insurance settlement and risked a comeback to the NHL. He played well enough that his tryout contract turned into a $2 million contract for the 2001–02 season, plus two one-year options that could have turned it into a $9.75 million pact. However, his option was not exercised by the Rangers after a disappointing season where he only scored 2 goals and 23 points despite playing in all 82 games for the Rangers.

Berard then inked a one-year deal with an option for a second year to join the Boston Bruins. With Boston, Berard began to return to his pre-injury form posting ten goals and 38 points, his highest total since his second year in the league. Despite his success, the Bruins balked when an arbitrator awarded Berard a $2.51 million contract and they walked away from the ruling, making him an unrestricted free agent.

The Chicago Blackhawks offered him a $2.01 million deal and signed him to a one-year contract. In Chicago, Berard&#x27;s game continued to improve and he finished the year second on the team in scoring with 47 points, just one off his career best. He capped his year by being awarded the Bill Masterton Trophy for his dedication to hockey. With his career seemingly on the upswing, the Blackhawks and Berard agreed on a one-year $3 million contract for the 2004–05 campaign. Blackhawks general manager Bob Pulford was eager to have him back, saying &quot;His point production was right up there with the best defensemen. He excels on the power play and that&#x27;s a huge part of the game now. It was important for us to get him under contract.&quot; But the season was ultimately cancelled due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, and with a new general manager replacing Pulford, Berard was not tendered an offer for the 2005–06 season.

As a free agent, Berard landed a two-year deal with the Columbus Blue Jackets. Columbus GM Doug MacLean felt that Berard&#x27;s skillset was a perfect fit for his club, saying &quot;Bryan brings a level of speed to our blue line that we&#x27;ve never had in the past,&quot; adding, &quot;With a more wide-open game coming in the NHL, Bryan should really flourish and we&#x27;re excited about what he adds to our hockey team.&quot; While Berard had overcome the limitations of his vision to become a solid offensive defensemen, his time in Columbus would be marred by troubles with his back. His first season with the Blue Jackets saw him post impressive numbers with 12 goals and 32 points in just 44 games but a back injury - and subsequent surgery - shut him down in March. In October, when he should have been gearing up for his second year with the club, he had another surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back and managed to play just eleven games with the Jackets. In late February, just before the trade deadline, the team waived Berard, ending his time in Columbus.

Berard accepted an invitation to attend training camp for the 2007–08 season with the Islanders, and performed well enough to earn a one-year contract with them. In his first game back with his original NHL team, Berard scored the game-winning goal in a 2–1 Islander victory against another of his former teams, the Rangers. Berard managed just five goals and 22 points that season.

===European career and retirement===
Prior to the start of the 2008–09 NHL season, Berard was invited to training camp with the Philadelphia Flyers. He was not offered a contract despite tallying three assists in Philadelphia&#x27;s camp. Berard signed on November 16, 2008, with Vityaz Chekhov of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He scored 17 points in 25 games played. Berard retired after the 2008–09 season due to problems with his back.

==Post retirement==
Berard lives in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. He appeared in 2011 on season 3 of the &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;, a CBC Television program.

He was a victim along with many other NHL players of a scam run by financial advisor Phil Kenner. Kenner was eventually sentenced to 17 years in prison for the scam.

==Positive drug test==
In early 2006, it was revealed that he had tested positive for an anabolic steroid known as 19-norandrosterone, in a drug test he had taken in November 2005. He was the first NHL player ever to test positive for steroids. The NHL did not hand down any form of suspension to Berard, as they did not administer the test, but he was banned from international play for two years effective January 3, 2006. Berard said after the incident, &quot;I made a mistake that resulted in a suspension and, while unintentional, I take full responsibility. I became aware of this problem after the fact, and for that, I am disappointed in myself.&quot;

<doc id="568859" wikidata="Q735158" url="?curid=568859" title="White-throated kingfisher">
<text>The white-throated kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis) also known as the white-breasted kingfisher is a tree kingfisher, widely distributed in Asia from the Sinai east through the Indian subcontinent to China and Indonesia. This kingfisher is a resident over much of its range, although some populations may make short distance movements. It can often be found well away from water where it feeds on a wide range of prey that includes small reptiles, amphibians, crabs, small rodents and even birds. During the breeding season they call loudly in the mornings from prominent perches including the tops of buildings in urban areas or on wires.

==Taxonomy==
The white-throated kingfisher is one of the many birds that were first formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He coined the binomial name &quot;Alcedo smyrnensis&quot;. Linnaeus cited Eleazar Albin&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Birds&quot; published in 1738 that included a description and a plate of the &quot;Smirna Kingfisher&quot;. Albin&#x27;s specimen was preserved in alcohol and had been collected by the botanist William Sherard who served as the British Consul at Smyrna between 1703 and 1716. The present genus &quot;Halcyon&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William Swainson in 1821. &quot;Halcyon&quot; is a name for a bird in Greek mythology generally associated with the kingfisher. The specific epithet &quot;smyrnensis&quot; is an adjective for the city of Smyrna (now İzmir in Turkey).

Five subspecies are recognised:

* &quot;H. s. smyrnensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – south Turkey to north east Egypt, Iraq to northwest India
* &quot;H. s. fusca&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – west India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;H. s. perpulchra&quot; Madarász, 1904 – Bhutan to east India, Indochina, the Malay Peninsula and west Java
* &quot;H. s. saturatior&quot; Hume, 1874 – Andaman Islands
* &quot;H. s. fokiensis&quot; Laubmann &amp; Götz, 1926 – south and east China, Taiwan and Hainan

The brown-breasted kingfisher (&quot;H. gularis&quot;) of the Philippines is usually now considered as a separate species. Support for this treatment was provided by a molecular study published in 2017 that found that &quot;H. s. gularis&quot; was more closely related to the Javan kingfisher (&quot;H. cyanoventris&quot;) than it was to the white-throated kingfisher. They were split as distinct species by the IUCN Red List and BirdLife International in 2014, and the International Ornithological Congress followed suit in 2022. The races &quot;H. s. perpulchra&quot; and &quot;H. s. fokiensis&quot; are sometimes included in &quot;H. s. fusca&quot;. 

Local names include Baluchistan: &quot;aspi chidok&quot;; Sindhi: &quot;dalel&quot;; Hindi: &quot;kilkila&quot;, &quot;kourilla&quot;; Himachal Pradesh: &quot;neela machhrala&quot;; Punjabi: &quot;wadda machhera&quot;; Bengali: &quot;sandabuk machhranga&quot;; Assamese: &quot;māsorokā, মাছৰোকা&quot;; Cachar: &quot;dao natu gophu&quot;; Gujarati: &quot;kalkaliyo&quot;, &quot;safedchati kalkaliyo&quot;; Marathi: &quot;khundya&quot;; Tamil: &quot;vichuli&quot;; Telugu: &quot;lakmuka&quot;, &quot;buchegadu&quot;; Malayalam: &quot;ponman&quot;; Kannada: Minchulli(ಮಿಂಚುಳ್ಳಿ),&quot;rajamatsi&quot;; Sinhalese: &quot;pilihuduwa&quot;.

==Description==

This is a large kingfisher, in length. The adult has a bright blue back, wings and tail. Its head, shoulders, flanks and lower belly are chestnut, and the throat and breast are white. The large bill and legs are bright red. The flight of the white-throated kingfisher is rapid and direct, the short rounded wings whirring. In flight, large white patches are visible on the blue and black wings. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are a duller version of the adult.

This species forms a superspecies with &quot;Halcyon cyanoventris&quot; and most major works recognize four geographic races. They vary clinally in size, the shades of blue on the mantle which is more greenish in &quot;smyrnensis&quot; and &quot;fusca&quot; and more blue or purplish in &quot;saturatior&quot;. &quot;H. s. gularis&quot; of the Philippines has only the neck and throat white. It is sometimes treated as a distinct species, &quot;H. gularis.&quot; Race &quot;fusca&quot; is found in Peninsular India and Sri Lanka and is slightly smaller, bluer and with a darker brown underside than the nominate race found in northwestern India. Race &quot;saturatior&quot; is found in the Andaman Islands and is larger with darker brown underparts. Race &quot;perpulchra&quot; (not always recognized) is found in northeastern India and is smaller than &quot;fusca&quot; with paler underparts. Albinism has been noted on occasion.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-throated kingfisher is a common species in a variety of habitats, mostly open country in the plains (but has been seen at 7500 ft in the Himalayas) with trees, wires or other perches. The range of the species is expanding.

This kingfisher is widespread and populations are not threatened. Average density of 4.58 individuals per km2. has been noted in the Sundarbans mangroves.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

The white-throated kingfisher begins breeding at the onset of the Monsoons. Males perch on prominent high posts in their territory and call in the early morning. The tail may be flicked now and in its courtship display the wings are stiffly flicked open for a second or two exposing the white wing mirrors. They also raise their bill high and display the white throat and front. The female in invitation makes a rapid and prolonged &quot;kit-kit-kit...&quot; call. The nest is a tunnel (50 cm long, but a nest with a 3-foot tunnel has been noted) in an earth bank. The nest building begins with both birds flying into a suitable mud wall until an indentation is made where they can find a perch hold. They subsequently perch and continue digging the nest with their bills. Nest tunnels in a haystack have also been recorded. A single clutch of 4–7 round white eggs is typical. The eggs take 20–22 days to hatch while the chicks fledge in 19 days.

===Feeding and diet===

It perches conspicuously on wires or other exposed perches within its territory, and is a frequent sight in south Asia. This species mainly hunts large crustaceans, insects, earthworms, rodents, lizards, snakes, fish and frogs. Predation of small birds such as the Indian white-eye, chick of a red-wattled lapwing, sparrows and munias have been reported. The young are fed mostly on invertebrates. In captivity, it has been noted that it rarely drinks water although bathing regularly.

===Movements===

Birds have sometimes been seen attracted to lights at night, especially during the monsoon season, suggesting that they are partly migratory.

===Mortality===
With a powerful bill and rapid flight, these kingfishers have few predators when healthy and rare cases of predation by a black kite and a jungle crow may be of sick or injured birds. An individual found dead with its beak embedded into the wood of a tree has been suggested as an accident during rapid pursuit of prey, possibly an Indian white-eye. A few parasites have been noted.

In the 1800s these birds were hunted for their bright feathers that were used to adorn hats. It is the State bird of West Bengal.

<text>Zurab Tchiaberashvili (, also spelled Chiaberashvili) (born 6 June 1972) is a Georgian politician and diplomat. He currently is a leading figure in the opposition European Georgia, after most recently serving as a governor of the Kakheti region.

Having a background in academia and the nongovernmental sector, Tchiaberashvili joined the ranks of the government after Georgia&#x27;s 2003 Rose Revolution, serving as the chairman of the Central Election Commission of Georgia from 2003 to 2004 and then as the mayor of Tbilisi from 2004 to 2005. Tchiaberashvili was Georgia&#x27;s permanent representative to the Council of Europe from 2005 to 2010 and ambassador to the Swiss Confederation and Principality of Liechtenstein, and Permanent Representative to the United Nations office and other international organizations in Geneva from 2010 to 2012. He served as Georgia&#x27;s Minister of Health, Labour and Social Affairs from March 20, 2012, to October 25, 2012.

==Education==
A Tbilisi native, Zurab Tchiaberashvili studied at the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology, Tbilisi State University (1989–1994, BA degree) and the Institute of Philosophy, Georgian National Academy of Sciences (1994–1997, MA degree), and obtained Ph.D. in Philosophy from the Tbilisi State University (1999). As an Open Society Institute&#x27;s Faculty Development Fellow, he spent two Spring Semesters (2002 and 2003) at the Transregional Center for Democratic Studies, Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science, New School University, New York, USA. In 2009 he graduated from the Executive MBA Joint program with Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, USA, and WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management, Vallendar, Germany.

==Early career==
Zurab Tchiaberashvili&#x27;s career started as a reporter and then a news editor for the Georgian daily &quot;Resonance&quot; in the 1990s. At that time, he also taught at the Faculty of Philosophy and Sociology, Tbilisi State University. In 1997 he began active in civic society, joining the election watchdog International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED) of which he became the Executive Director in 2002.

Tchiaberashvili was among those observers who denounced the November 2, 2003 Georgian parliamentary election as rigged. The protests that followed the election led to the resignation of the then-President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze in what became known as the &quot;Rose Revolution&quot; on November 23, 2003. After the power change, Tchiaberashvili became the chairman of the Central Election Commission of Georgia, being in charge of conducting the snap presidential and parliamentary elections in 2004.

==Government and diplomatic service==
On April 19, 2004, Tchiaberashvili became Mayor of Tbilisi—the capital of Georgia—still an appointive office at that time, after President Mikheil Saakashvili dismissed Mayor Ivane Zodelava. He presided over the creation of a strategic plan to overcome problems with Tbilisi&#x27;s urban infrastructure, including the water, sewage, electric, and public transportation systems. During his tenure, Tchiaberashvili was criticized by his former NGO colleagues for turning back from his original plans to decentralize the Tbilisi government.

On September 16, 2005, Tchiaberashvili was approved by the Parliament of Georgia as Georgia&#x27;s permanent representative to the Council of Europe (CoE), a position which made him involved in diplomatic battles following the August 2008 Russian–Georgian war. On December 10, 2010, Tchiaberashvili was approved as ambassador to the Swiss Confederation and Principality of Liechtenstein, and Permanent Representative to the United Nations office and other international organizations in Geneva. In 2011, he was involved in the Swiss-mediated Russian–Georgian negotiations over Russia&#x27;s ascension to World Trade Organization. On March 15, 2012, he was nominated as Georgia&#x27;s Minister of Health, Labour and Social Affairs, and approved by the Parliament of Georgia on March 20, 2012. After the October 2012 parliamentary election, he was succeeded by David Sergeenko. Tchiaberashvili was instead moved by President Saakashvili to the position of governor of the eastern Georgian region of Kakheti. Subsequently, he became a leading opposition politician, with the United National Movement.

==Arrest and sentence==
On May 21, 2013, Zurab Tchiaberashvili and Ivane Merabishvili, Georgia&#x27;s former Prime Minister and the Secretary General of the United National Movement party, were arrested in connection to investigation into alleged misspending of GEL 5.2 million public funds on their party activists during the 2012 election campaign, leading to accusations of political vendetta leveled by the United National Movement against the Ivanishvili government.

On February 17, 2014 Tchiaberashvili was sentenced a fine of 52,000 lari for being negligent about his duties. The Tchiaberashvili defense team appealed the sentence.

==Personal life==
Tchiaberashvili is married to Nino Lakvekheliani, with two children: Giorgi and Mariam.

<text>Edward Jovanovski (born June 26, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He was born in Windsor, Ontario, and is of Macedonian descent.

Jovanovski played major junior ice hockey for two seasons with the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), earning First All-Star, Second All-Star and All-Rookie Team honours. He was then selected first overall in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers. During his rookie NHL season, he earned All-Rookie Team honours and helped the Panthers advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Colorado Avalanche. After three-and-a-half seasons in Florida, Jovanovski was traded to the Vancouver Canucks in a seven-player deal involving Pavel Bure. During his tenure with Vancouver, he was awarded the Babe Pratt Trophy as the team&#x27;s best defenceman three consecutive years. He also led the club&#x27;s defencemen in scoring four consecutive years. In July 2006, Jovanovski became an unrestricted free agent and signed with the Phoenix Coyotes. He led the team&#x27;s defencemen in scoring during his first three years with the club. Jovanovski returned to the Florida Panthers for three seasons, before retiring in 2015. Nicknamed &quot;JovoCop&quot;, Jovanovski was known as a two-way defenceman, recording three 40-point and one 50-point season in the NHL.

Internationally, Jovanovski played for the Canadian national team. A one-time Winter Olympian, he won a gold medal at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. At the under-20 level, he won gold at the 1995 World Junior Championship. He went on to play in four World Championships, winning silver in 2005 and 2008. He represented Canada at the 2004 World Cup, playing in one game due to injury in the championship-winning tournament.

==Playing career==

===Major junior (1993–95)===
As a youth, Jovanovski played in the 1990 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Windsor. After playing bantam and Junior B in his hometown of Windsor, Jovanovski joined the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Windsor Spitfires. In his rookie season with the Spitfires, Jovanovski led all team defencemen in scoring, with 50 points in 62 games. In addition to being voted as the Emms Division&#x27;s top bodychecker by League coaches, he was named to the OHL&#x27;s All-Rookie and Second All-Star Teams. That off-season, Jovanovski was selected first overall by the Florida Panthers in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He admitted to being surprised at the top selection, as he had not been ranked first at any point in his draft-eligible season. Czech prospect Radek Bonk was ranked first overall by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, but Panthers President Bill Torrey preferred to select a defenceman over a forward.

Following the Draft, the 1994–95 NHL season was suspended for three-and-a-half months due to a labour dispute between NHL players and owners. Consequently, Jovanovski remained in junior for the beginning of the 1994–95 OHL season. When NHL was set to resume play in January 1995, it was speculated that the Panthers might sign Jovanovski and call him up to the NHL. However, then-Panthers General Manager Bryan Murray announced that Jovanovski would remain with Windsor, citing that he would likely not receive much playing time with the club. He averaged approximately 40 minutes per game with Windsor that season, scoring 23 goals and 65 points over 50 contests. He also added nine points in nine playoff games before Windsor was eliminated. Jovanovski was named to the OHL First All-Star Team.

===Florida Panthers (1995–1999)===
Following his second major junior season, Jovanovski signed a four-year, $5.7 million contract with the Panthers in June 1995. Playing with the club during the subsequent pre-season, he broke his right hand during a fight with Hartford Whalers forward Brendan Shanahan. The injury caused him to miss the first 11 games of the season. After recovering, he scored his first career NHL goal against the Whalers on December 2, 1995, a game-winner in a 5–3 victory. He finished his rookie season with 10 goals and 21 points over 70 games. During the regular season, he was encouraged by Panthers management to play more conservatively than he was used to in the OHL, focusing on defensive positioning.

Ranking fourth in the Eastern Conference going into the 1996 playoffs, Jovanovski helped the Panthers advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. He scored his first career Stanley Cup playoff goal in Game 2 of the first round against Boston Bruins goaltender Craig Billington. Facing the Colorado Avalanche in the Finals, the Panthers were defeated in four-straight games. Jovanovski contributed a goal and nine points in 22 post-season games. It would be his only Stanley Cup Finals appearance. In the off-season, he was named to the NHL All-Rookie Team. He was also nominated for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League&#x27;s rookie of the year, alongside Chicago Blackhawks forward Éric Dazé and Ottawa Senators forward Daniel Alfredsson, who ultimately won the award.

On November 23, 1996, Jovanovski received a three-game suspension from the NHL without pay. In a game against the Dallas Stars the previous night, he illegally left the penalty box ready to fight any opposing players during a break in play. Later in the season, he suffered a knee injury during a game against the Edmonton Oilers in January 1997, sidelining him for several weeks. The following month, he was involved in an on-ice altercation with San Jose Sharks forward Bernie Nicholls, resulting in a two-game suspension and the maximum $1,000 fine for Nicholls for intent to injure. The accumulated injuries and suspensions caused Jovanovski to miss 21 games in his second NHL season. He scored seven goals and 23 points over 61 contests.

In 1997–98, Jovanovski appeared in 81 games, recording nine goals and 23 points. With his contract set to expire following the 1998–99 season, Jovanovski was beginning to be seen as a disappointment in Florida, failing to improve on his successful rookie year.

===Vancouver Canucks (1999–2006)===
On January 17, 1999, after three-and-a-half seasons with the Panthers, Jovanovski was traded in a seven-player deal to the Vancouver Canucks. He was sent with Dave Gagner, Mike Brown, Kevin Weekes and a first-round draft pick in 2000 (Nathan Smith) in exchange for Pavel Bure, Bret Hedican, Brad Ference and a third-round pick in 2000 (Robert Fried). Joining the Canucks in the midst of a rebuilding period for the franchise, Jovanovski quickly established himself as a top defenceman in Vancouver&#x27;s lineup. His ability to join the rush as a defenceman complemented the Canucks&#x27; up-tempo style of play.

A month following his trade, Jovanovski suffered a broken foot while blocking a shot in a game against the New Jersey Devils on February 9, 1999. Later in the season, he was involved in an altercation with Montreal Canadiens forward Shayne Corson. After being high-sticked in the face by Corson, the two players were sent off the ice, at which point Corson entered the Canucks&#x27; dressing room to verbally confront Jovanovski. According to Corson, the feud stemmed from comments Jovanovski had said about his family. As a result of entering the Canucks&#x27; dressing room, the Canadiens forward was later suspended five games by the NHL, in addition to one game for the high-sticking infraction. In 31 games with the Canucks that season, Jovanovski recorded two goals and 11 points. Combined with his games played with the Panthers, he totalled 27 points in 72 games.
In his first full season with Vancouver, Jovanovski tallied five goals and 26 points (first among team defencemen) over 75 games. He also ranked second among team defencemen in average ice time per game, behind only Mattias Öhlund. The following season, in 2000–01, he led all team defencemen with 12 goals and 47 points over 79 games. He was then named to his first of three consecutive NHL All-Star Games in 2001. At the end of the season, he also earned his first of three consecutive Babe Pratt Trophies, awarded annually to the Canucks&#x27; fan-voted best defenceman. Jovanovski&#x27;s offensive emergence helped the Canucks return to the playoffs after a six-year absence. It also marked Jovanovski&#x27;s first playoff season since 1997.

In 2001–02, Jovanovski scored a career-high 17 goals, ranking second amongst all NHL defencemen. His 48 points ranked sixth among NHL defencemen and was his highest total as a Canuck. The Canucks finished as the eighth seed in the Western Conference for the second consecutive season, and were eliminated by the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round of the 2002 playoffs. Jovanovski contributed a goal and five points in six post-season games.

Midway through the following season, he was re-signed by the Canucks to a three-year contract extension on January 27, 2003. The day after signing, he injured his foot, sidelining him for 14 games. Despite his season being shortened by injury, he recorded a career-high 40 assists to go with six goals in 2002–03. His 46 points ranked tenth overall in the League amongst defencemen, and it marked the fourth consecutive year he led Canucks defencemen in scoring. Jovanovski added eight points in 14 post-season games before the Canucks were eliminated in the second round by the Minnesota Wild. His seven goals led all League defencemen in playoff scoring.

Midway through the 2003–04 season, Jovanovski suffered a third-degree shoulder separation during a game against the Nashville Predators on January 25, 2004. Colliding with opposing forward Martin Erat, he fell to ice and slid into the rink boards. He returned late in the season to help the Canucks secure the Northwest Division title. In 56 games, he scored seven goals and 23 points. Adding four assists in seven 2004 playoff games, the Canucks were defeated in the first round by the Calgary Flames.
Due to the NHL lockout, as well as rib and knee injuries sustained during the 2004 World Cup, Jovanovski was inactive during the 2004–05 season. When the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Jovanovski was on pace for a career year, but his season was interrupted by groin, foot and abdominal injuries. He finished with 33 points in 44 games for a career-high 0.75 points-per-game average. The Canucks suffered from Jovanovski missing the final 27 games of the season and did not qualify for the 2006 playoffs. Following the 2005–06 season, Jovanovski did not receive a contract offer from the Canucks, subsequently becoming an unrestricted free agent. The decision to let him go was influenced by the re-signings of Daniel and Henrik Sedin, as well as the acquisition of goaltender Roberto Luongo, leaving no room on the team&#x27;s salary cap to retain Jovanovski.

===Phoenix Coyotes (2006–2011)===
On July 1, 2006, Jovanovski joined the Phoenix Coyotes, signing a five-year, $32.5 million contract. Having received a contract offer from the Panthers, he was speculated to return to Florida, where he spent his summers. He cited being coached by Wayne Gretzky as a strong factor for choosing Phoenix. Jovanovski was named to his fourth NHL All-Star Game in the subsequent season, but continued to be plagued with injuries. He missed the last 22 games of the 2006–07 regular season with an abdominal injury, limiting him to 29 points (first among Coyotes defencemen) in 54 games. The Coyotes finished last in the Western Conference with 31 wins and 67 points.

In 2007–08, Jovanovski recorded a career-high 51 points (12 goals and 39 assists), which tied for tenth among League defencemen and led all Coyotes defencemen. It was also the second-highest total for a defenceman in Coyotes history after Oleg Tverdovsky&#x27;s 55-point year in 1996–97. Jovanovski&#x27;s career season included a one-game suspension on December 1, 2007, for a hit to the head of Minnesota Wild forward Marián Gáborík. Jovanovski also appeared in his second consecutive All-Star Game in 2008. The team continued to struggle, however, as they ranked 12th in the West, eight points out of a 2008 playoff spot. The following season, Jovanovski&#x27;s offensive production dipped to 36 points in 82 games. Although it was his lowest total since his third season with the Panthers in 1997–98 (not including seasons with major injuries), he still led all Coyotes defencemen in scoring for the third consecutive year. On a team basis, he missed the playoffs with Phoenix for the third-straight year, as they finished 13th in the West.

Early in the 2009–10 season, Jovanovski missed ten games with a lower-body injury in November and December 2009. Shortly after returning to the Coyotes lineup, he was suspended for two games by the NHL for a hit to the head of Minnesota Wild forward Andrew Ebbett with his forearm on December 7, 2009. The following month, he received another two-game suspension for elbowing New York Islanders rookie forward John Tavares in the head. Over 66 games during the season, he notched 10 goals and 34 points. He was overtaken as the team&#x27;s top-scoring defenceman by Keith Yandle, who had scored 41 points. While the season was marked with an uncertain future for the Coyotes from a business perspective, as the franchise had filed for bankruptcy in May 2009 and was taken over by the NHL, the team performed well and recorded their best season in history. With 50 wins and 107 points (a 28-point improval from the previous season), they finished with the third best record in the West and came within five points of a Pacific Division and Conference title, trailing only the San Jose Sharks. Facing the Detroit Red Wings in the opening round, the Coyotes were eliminated in seven games. Jovanovski had one goal and no assists in his first NHL playoffs since 2004.
In the first month of the 2010–11 season, Jovanovski was chosen to serve in place of the suspended Shane Doan as team captain from October 21 to 25, 2010. Over a week later, he recorded his first career NHL hat-trick in a 4–3 win against the Nashville Predators on November 3. He scored all three goals against goaltender Pekka Rinne, becoming the first Coyotes defenceman to score a hat-trick in team history. On December 26, he became the 256th player in NHL history to play 1,000 career games, reaching the feat against the Dallas Stars. Jovanovski struggled with injuries throughout the season, missing time on six occasions. His most serious injury was an orbital bone fracture after his face collided with an opposing player&#x27;s helmet in a game against the Atlanta Thrashers on February 17, 2011. After missing 20 games with the injury, he returned in April for the last three games of the regular season and the playoffs. In Jovanovski&#x27;s limited time in the season, he recorded 14 points over 50 games. The Coyotes ranked sixth in the West, drawing the Red Wings in the first round for the second consecutive year. Jovanovski recorded one assist in the post-season as the Coyotes were eliminated in four games.

===Return to Florida (2011–2014)===
Jovanovski signed a four-year, $16.5 million contract to return to the Florida Panthers on July 1, 2011. He played a large role in helping reshape the franchise&#x27;s rebuilding and drive to make the playoffs. Panthers coach Kevin Dineen named Jovanovski captain for the 2012–13 but it would prove to be a very frustrating season for him and the team. A nagging hip injury kept him on the sidelines and limited him to just six games before a season ending surgery shut him down with the team sitting in last place. After a ten-month recovery, Jovanovski returned to the ice in January 2014 and played 37 games for Florida. He had intended to play out the final year of his contract and retire but the Panthers had different plans and on June 29, 2014, he was placed on unconditional waivers for the purpose of a buyout. Florida&#x27;s General Manager at the time, Dave Tallon, made it clear that buying out his captain was a tough call to make. &quot;“We sincerely thank Ed for his seven years of service and dedication to the Florida Panthers and the South Florida community,” said Tallon. “He is a true professional in every sense and is well respected throughout the league for the way he handles himself both on and off the ice. This was not an easy decision and we wish him success and happiness in his future endeavors.”

Jovanovski remained inactive in the NHL during the 2014–15 season and on December 28, 2015, he announced his retirement from the NHL.

==International play==
Jovanovski competed for Canada&#x27;s under-20 team at the 1995 World Junior Championships, held in Alberta. Scoring two goals in seven games, he helped Canada go undefeated to win gold. Following his NHL rookie season, he was named as a reserve to the Canadian men&#x27;s team for the 1996 World Cup. The youngest player on the roster, he played in one exhibition game against Russia, a 4–4 tie, but did not appear in any main tournament games as Canada lost in the final to the United States.

Two years later, Jovanovski competed at the 1998 World Championships in Switzerland; he was the second-youngest named to the Canadian squad. He scored two goals and an assist over six games as Canada failed to qualify past the crossover round. He made his second World Championships appearance at the 2000 tournament in Russia. He scored a goal and an assist over nine games. Canada lost the semifinal, however, 2–1 to the Czech Republic, then lost the bronze medal game 2–1 to Finland.

In December 2001, Jovanovski was chosen to Canada&#x27;s Olympic team for the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City. Playing the United States in the gold medal game, Jovanovski earned an assist on the game-winning goal, backhanding a saucer pass from the opposition&#x27;s blueline to Joe Sakic on a five-on-three power play advantage. Canada went on to win the gold medal, 5–2. Jovanovski had three points, all assists, in total.

Prior to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Jovanovski played for Canada at the 2004 World Cup. He suffered a cracked rib and a second degree sprain on his medial collateral ligament (MCL) during the first game against the United States, sidelining him for the rest of the tournament. He was replaced by San Jose Sharks defenceman Scott Hannan in the lineup. Canada went on to win the championship over Finland in the final.

The following year, he competed at the 2005 World Championships in Austria. In the semi-final, Jovanovski scored the game-winning goal against Russia in a 4–3 win. Advancing to the gold medal game, Canada lost 3–0 to the Czech Republic, thus earning silver. He finished the tournament with a goal and two assists over nine games. Later that year, he was named to his second Canadian Olympic team for the 2006 Games in Turin, but was not able to play due to a lower abdominal injury.

Making his fourth World Championships appearance in 2008, Jovanovski earned a second-straight silver medal. He recorded one assist over nine games as Canada lost in the gold medal game by a 5–4 score in overtime to Russia.

==Playing style==
Jovanovski was known as a two-way defenceman. Able to contribute offensively, he was an adept puck-carrier and joined plays deep in the opposing team&#x27;s zone. He played defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both aspects of his game, he was regarded as playing with a high level of risk, taking the chance to be out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or bodycheck.

==Personal life==
Jovanovski was born in Windsor, Ontario, to Kostadin and Lilja Jovanovski. His parents immigrated to Canada in 1973 from Macedonia. Coming from an athletic family, Kostadin was a semi-professional soccer player in Yugoslavia. Jovanovski speaks English, French and some Macedonian. Jovanovski followed after his father and played organized soccer growing up. He did not start playing hockey until age 11, when his older brother, Denny, joined a team.

During his junior career, Jovanovski and two other Windsor Spitfire teammates were charged with sexually assaulting a 24-year-old woman in February 1995. After a pre-trial hearing in June, the Crown attorney dropped the charges in August due to a lack of convincing evidence.

Beginning his NHL career with the Florida Panthers, he owned a condominium in Boca Raton, Florida. He met his wife, Kirstin, in Florida and retained a residence in Boca Raton, where he spent his summers. Jovanovski and Kirstin had their first child, daughter Kylie Everett, on August 25, 1998. Three years later, Kyra was born on April 24, 2001, while her twin sister died in utero. Kirstin was later pregnant with twins a second time and gave birth to son Cole and daughter Coco on May 25, 2006, in Florida.

In 2005, Jovanovski was featured in a documentary aired on multicultural network Omni Television. Entitled &quot;The Late Bloomer: Ed Jovanovski&quot;, it explored his career, family tragedy and attachments to his Macedonian heritage.

<text>Desmond Dekker (born Desmond Adolphus Dacres; 16 July 1941 – 25 May 2006) was a Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae singer-songwriter and musician. Together with his backing group the Aces (consisting of Wilson James and Easton Barrington Howard), he had one of the earliest international reggae hits with &quot;Israelites&quot; (1968). Other hits include &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot; (1967), &quot;It Mek&quot; (1969) and &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot; (1970).

==Early life==
Desmond Adolphus Dacres was born in Saint Andrew Parish (Greater Kingston), Jamaica, on 16 July 1941. Dekker spent his formative years in Kingston. From a young age he regularly attended the local church with his grandmother and aunt. This early religious upbringing, as well as Dekker&#x27;s enjoyment of singing hymns, led to a lifelong religious commitment. Following his mother&#x27;s death, he moved to the parish of St. Mary and later to St. Thomas. While at St. Thomas, Dekker embarked on an apprenticeship as a tailor before returning to Kingston, where he became a welder. His workplace singing had drawn the attention of his co-workers, who encouraged him to pursue a career in music. 

In 1961 he auditioned for Coxsone Dodd (Studio One) and Duke Reid (Treasure Isle), though neither audition was successful. The unsigned vocalist then auditioned for Leslie Kong&#x27;s Beverley&#x27;s record label and was awarded his first recording contract.

==Career==
Despite achieving a record deal, it was two years before Dekker saw his first record released. Meanwhile, Dekker spotted the talent of Bob Marley, a fellow welder, and brought the youth to Kong&#x27;s attention. In 1962 &quot;Judge Not&quot; and &quot;One Cup Of Coffee&quot; became the first recorded efforts of Marley, who retained gratitude, respect and admiration for Dekker for the rest of his life. Eventually in 1963 Kong chose &quot;Honour Your Mother and Father&quot; (written by Dekker and the song that Dekker had sung in his Kong audition two years earlier), which became a Jamaican hit and established Dekker&#x27;s musical career. This was followed by the release of the tracks &quot;Sinners, Prepare&quot; and &quot;Labour for Learning&quot;. It was during this period that Desmond Dacres adopted the stage-name of Desmond Dekker. His fourth hit, &quot;King of Ska&quot; (backing vocals by The Cherrypies, also known as the Maytals), made him into one of the island&#x27;s biggest stars. Dekker then recruited four brothers, Carl, Patrick, Clive and Barry Howard, as his permanent backing vocalists to perform with him under the name Desmond Dekker and the Aces.

The new group recorded a number of Jamaican hits, including &quot;Parents&quot;, &quot;Get Up Edina&quot;, &quot;This Woman&quot; and &quot;Mount Zion&quot;. The themes of Dekker&#x27;s songs during the first four years of his career dealt with the moral, cultural and social issues of mainstream Jamaican culture: respect for one&#x27;s parents (&quot;Honour Your Mother and Father&quot;), religious morality (&quot;Sinners, Prepare&quot;) and education (&quot;Labour for Learning&quot;). In 1967 he appeared on Derrick Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Tougher Than Tough&quot;, which helped begin a trend of popular songs commenting on the rude boy subculture which was rooted in Jamaican ghetto life where opportunities for advancement were limited and life was economically difficult. Dekker&#x27;s own songs did not go to the extremes of many other popular rude boy songs, which reflected the violence and social problems associated with ghetto life, though he did introduce lyrics that resonated with the rude boys, starting with one of his best-known songs, &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot;. The song established Dekker as a rude boy icon in Jamaica and also became a favourite dance track for the young working-class men and women of the United Kingdom&#x27;s mod scene. &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot; was a top 15 hit in the UK and his UK concerts were attended by a large following of mods wherever he played.

Dekker continued to release rude boy songs such as &quot;Rude Boy Train&quot; and &quot;Rudie Got Soul&quot;, as well as mainstream cultural songs like &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame&quot;, &quot;Wise Man&quot;, &quot;Hey Grandma&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot;, &quot;If It Pays&quot;, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Young Girl&quot;, &quot;Sabotage&quot; and &quot;Pretty Africa&quot;. Many of the hits from this era came from his debut album, &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot;.

In 1968 Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Israelites&quot; was released, eventually topping the UK Singles Chart in April 1969 and peaking in the top ten of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in June 1969. Dekker was the first Jamaican artist to have a hit record in the US with Jamaican-style music. Ironically although he went to worldwide fame his former welding colleague Marley never had a UK number one. That same year saw the release of &quot;Beautiful and Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Writing on the Wall&quot;, &quot;Music Like Dirt (Intensified &#x27;68)&quot; (which won the 1968 Jamaica Independence Festival Song Contest), &quot;Bongo Girl&quot; and &quot;Shing a Ling&quot;. 1969 saw the release of &quot;It Mek&quot;, which became a hit both in Jamaica and the UK. Dekker also released &quot;Problems&quot; and &quot;Pickney Gal&quot;, both of which were popular in Jamaica, although only &quot;Pickney Gal&quot; managed to chart in the UK top 50.

===1970s===
In 1970 Dekker released &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot;, written by Jimmy Cliff, which reached No. 2 in the UK charts. Dekker was initially reluctant to record the track but was eventually persuaded to do so by Leslie Kong. Dekker&#x27;s version uses the same backing track as Cliff&#x27;s original. Kong, whose music production skills had been a crucial part of both Dekker&#x27;s and Cliff&#x27;s careers, died in 1971, affecting the careers of both artists for a short period of time. In 1972 the rude boy film &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; was released and Dekker&#x27;s &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot; was featured on the soundtrack along with Cliff&#x27;s version of &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot;, as well as other Jamaican artists&#x27; hits, giving reggae more international exposure and preparing the way for Bob Marley.

In 1975 &quot;Israelites&quot; was re-released and became a UK top 10 hit for a second time. Dekker had also begun working on new material with the production duo Bruce Anthony in 1974. In 1975 this collaboration resulted in the release of &quot;Sing a Little Song&quot;, which charted in the UK top twenty; this was to be his last UK hit.

===1980s and later===
The 1980s found Dekker signed to a new label, Stiff Records, an independent label that specialized in punk and new wave acts as well as releases associated with the 2 Tone label, whose acts instigated a short-lived but influential ska revival. He recorded an album called &quot;Black &amp; Dekker&quot; (1980), which featured his previous hits backed by The Rumour, Graham Parker&#x27;s backing band and Akrylykz (featuring Roland Gift, later of Fine Young Cannibals). A re-recorded version of &quot;Israelites&quot; was released in 1980 on the Stiff label, followed by other new recordings: Jimmy Cliff&#x27;s &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; and &quot;Book of Rules&quot;. Dekker&#x27;s next album, &quot;Compass Point&quot; (1981), was produced by Robert Palmer. Despite declining sales, Dekker remained a popular live performer and continued to tour with The Rumour.

Only a single live album was released in the late &#x27;80s. In 1990 &quot;Israelites&quot; was used in a Maxell TV advert that became popular and brought the song and artist back to the attention of the general public. He collaborated with the Specials on the 1993 album, &quot;King of Kings&quot;, which was released under Desmond Dekker and the Specials. &quot;King of Kings&quot; consists of songs by Dekker&#x27;s musical heroes including Byron Lee; Theophilus Beckford, Jimmy Cliff, and his friend and fellow Kong label artist, Derrick Morgan. He also collaborated on a remix of &quot;Israelites&quot; with reggae artist Apache Indian. In 2003 a reissue of &quot;The Harder They Come&quot; soundtrack featured &quot;Israelites&quot; and &quot;007 (Shanty Town)&quot;. Desmond headlined Jools Holland&#x27;s 2003 Annual Hootenanny.

==Personal life and death==
In 1969, Dekker took permanent residency in the UK. In 1984, he was declared bankrupt. 

Dekker died of a heart attack on 25 May 2006, at his home in Thornton Heath in the London Borough of Croydon, England, aged 64 and was buried at Streatham Park Cemetery. He was preparing to headline The World Music Festival in Prague. Dekker was divorced and was survived by his son Desmond Dekker Jnr and daughter Desrene Dekker.

<text>Coron is the third-largest island in the Calamian Islands in northern Palawan in the Philippines. The island is part of the larger municipality of the same name. It is about southwest of Manila and is known for several Japanese shipwrecks of World War II vintage. Because of its unique ecological features, the entire area is protected by several legal proclamations.

The island and surrounding fishing grounds are part of the ancestral domain of the indigenous Tagbanwa people, officially designated such on June 5, 1998. Known as Calis among the Tagbanwas and Coronians, its tribal chieftain is Rodolfo Aguilar I.

The island comprises two barangays of the municipality of Coron: Banuang Daan and Cabugao.

== Geography ==
Partially between Busuanga and Culion islands, Coron Island faces the Sulu Sea and forms the eastern side of Coron Bay. It is about long from north to south, and at its widest point.

Part of the North Palawan Block, Coron Island is distinguished by its Late Triassic Coron Limestone.

There are 15 lakes nestled in the rugged terrain, of which three have underground connections to the sea. There are a few mangroves in coastal areas.

== Diving ==
The area around the wrecks has rock formations which provide for snorkeling opportunities, with underwater visibility extending up to . The water is often calm. 

Coron is known for wreck diving. Wreck dive sites are found in depths as shallow as and as deep as . Wreck diving sites in Coron Bay include the &quot;Akitsushima&quot;, &quot;Irako&quot;, &quot;Kogyo Maru&quot;, &quot;Kyokuzan Maru&quot;, &quot;Okikawa Maru&quot;, &quot;Olympia Maru&quot;.

Dive sites around Coron include many different reef dive sites and &quot;Günter&#x27;s Cave&quot;, also known as Cathedral Cave because during a certain time of the day, the sun throws a beam of light through a hole in the cave ceiling, illuminating the inside. It is possible to surface in the cave, as the hole in the cave-ceiling allows fresh air to enter. The cave is named after Günther Bernert, who was part of the first dive group to explore the cave, after hearing from local fishermen about its existence.

== Other points of interest ==
Ecotourism has long surpassed diving as the top draw to Coron Island in the last decade. With domestic tourism on the rise due to a rapidly growing middle class, Coron is one of the top destinations for Filipinos to add to their wish list, with Coron Island containing some of the most iconic.

<text>Alexandre Daigle (born February 7, 1975) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. A highly touted junior prospect, Daigle was drafted first overall in the 1993 NHL entry draft by the Ottawa Senators. After recording a modest career high of 51 points in three separate National Hockey League (NHL) regular seasons, Daigle briefly retired from hockey at age 25 but returned to the NHL two years later. Although he played ten seasons in the NHL and four in the Swiss NL, he failed to live up to the high expectations put forth when he was drafted first overall and is therefore regarded by many to have been a draft bust.

==Playing career==
===Amateur career===
As a youth, Daigle played in the 1988 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Laval, Quebec.

===NHL career===
Leading up to the 1993 NHL entry draft, Daigle was considered a &quot;can&#x27;t miss&quot; prospect and NHL superstar-in-waiting. The Senators were even accused of deliberately losing games late in the 1992–93 season, their first in the NHL, to guarantee the first overall selection and the right to draft him. This prompted an investigation by the NHL, which soon implemented a draft lottery to prevent such things from happening again. The Senators subsequently finished last place overall in the 1992–93 league standings, thus securing the rights to the first overall pick.

As the draft approached, the Quebec Nordiques, who were hosting the event, were reportedly so eager to draft the next Quebecois superstar that they were rumored to have offered star players such as Owen Nolan, Peter Forsberg, Ron Hextall, and draft picks, but Ottawa management disregarded all offers. The Senators selected Daigle first overall, ahead of future Hall-of-Famers Chris Pronger and Paul Kariya. He subsequently received the largest starting salary in league history (five years, $12.25 million), leading to the introduction of a rookie salary cap a few years later. Regarding his draft position, Daigle uttered the now infamous comment, &quot;I&#x27;m glad I got drafted first, because no one remembers number two&quot;. Chris Pronger, selected with the second pick by the Hartford Whalers, was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2015.

Daigle initially seemed destined to live up to the pre-draft hype, scoring 20 goals and 51 points in a rookie season in which he had little offensive support, and his 37 points in the lockout-shortened 1994-95 season had him on pace for 28 goals &amp; 66 points in an 84 game schedule. However, he was never able to reproduce his junior dominance, and the superstardom the Senators and the league had hoped for never materialized. He scored 20 or more goals twice – in his rookie year and in 1996–97, never registering more than 26 goals in a season. He was frequently criticized for lack of effort and motivation, with his lucrative long-term contract perhaps partially to blame. He seemed interested in the limelight, appearing in a full-page ad dressed in a nurse&#x27;s uniform.

Russian center Alexei Yashin outplayed Daigle in every season that they were teammates in Ottawa. Both entered the league in the 1993–94 season and were promoted as future stars of the franchise, displayed on the cover of the Senators&#x27; yearbook and media guide. Management, however, supported Daigle over Yashin, touting him over Yashin for the Calder Memorial Trophy (though Yashin ended up receiving a nomination instead of Daigle). After management continued to support Daigle despite his subpar performance, an angered Yashin held out in the 1995–96 season unless his contract was renegotiated to pay him at a level similar to Daigle&#x27;s. Head coach Rick Bowness and assistant coach Alain Vigneault were fired on November 21, 1995, after demoting Daigle to the fourth line.

On September 25, 1996, Daigle was removed from a team flight when, while chatting with a flight attendant aboard USAir Flight 1948, he leaned over to Trevor Timmins (then the Senators&#x27; Director Of Team Services) and said, &quot;Watch out for your bomb there&quot; while motioning towards Timmins&#x27; laptop computer. Upon hearing Daigle&#x27;s comment, the flight attendant notified the captain, who immediately contacted USAir ground control, and police were subsequently notified. What Daigle did not know was that then-U.S. President Bill Clinton was also on the Pittsburgh International Airport&#x27;s tarmac at the time, resulting in a heightened level of security. Daigle was not prosecuted for the incident, but was fined $300 and barred from boarding the connecting flight to Tampa with the rest of the team.

During the 1997–98 season, after four and a half seasons, 74 goals, and 172 points in 301 games played, Ottawa finally soured on Daigle and traded him to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for prospect Václav Prospal and another first-round bust, Pat Falloon. With the Flyers, Daigle scored 31 points in 68 games. In January 1999, Philadelphia traded Daigle to the Edmonton Oilers, who later that same day traded him to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Alexander Selivanov. Daigle played only 32 games for the Lightning, collecting six goals and six assists for 12 points. The New York Rangers then acquired Daigle as a reclamation project, sending cash to the Lightning, but they too realized the one-time junior superstar was not living up to expectations and waived him at the end of the season. In 58 games with the Rangers, Daigle recorded just 8 goals and 18 assists for 26 points.

Daigle found himself out of hockey by the age of 25. No one was willing to take a chance on the under-achiever, and in fact, Daigle admitted he had no desire to play the game anymore. In an interview on Radio-Canada, he said he never wanted to play hockey but stuck to the game because of his talent. Instead, he became interested in the entertainment business and the opportunity to be a celebrity. He played hockey in a small league in Los Angeles with Cuba Gooding Jr. on Jerry Bruckheimer&#x27;s team, the &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, and created an event promotion company, Impostor Entertainment, with former Montreal Expos pitcher Derek Aucoin. Their first project was a concert featuring Sheryl Crow during the Canadian Grand Prix Formula One auto race in Montreal.

Following a two-year absence from hockey and in need of a steady paycheque, Daigle decided to attempt an NHL comeback. In mid-2002, he contacted numerous teams looking for an invitation to training camp, ultimately signing with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Daigle would lead the Penguins in pre-season scoring, earning himself a spot on the Pittsburgh roster to start the season. Despite his impressive training camp, Daigle was unable to continue his success into the regular season, ultimately spending the better part of the season with the team&#x27;s AHL affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. After his contract was not renewed by the Penguins, Daigle signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Wild in the offseason.

After arriving in Minnesota, Daigle impressed the Wild coaching staff enough to earn a roster spot for opening night. For the 2003–04 season, Daigle managed to match his career-high point total, finishing the campaign with 51 points (20 goals and 31 assists) to lead the team in scoring. During this season, he was also the Wild&#x27;s nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, given annually to an NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey. On March 6, 2006, Minnesota waived Daigle and reassigned him to the team&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Houston Aeros. Daigle did not play a game for the Aeros and was subsequently loaned to the AHL&#x27;s Manchester Monarchs on March 13, 2006, in exchange for forward Brendan Bernakevitch.

===Post NHL-career===
Aware that his NHL career was over, Daigle set his sights on Europe. On May 5, 2006, he signed a two-year contract with Davos, a top team in the Swiss National League A, and inked a two-year extension with them in December. During his three complete seasons playing in Davos, the team won the league championship on two occasions. In a little over three seasons with Davos, Daigle played 137 games, tallying 46 goals and 94 assists for 140 points (averaging a little over one point per game).

On October 26, 2009, Daigle was loaned to the SCL Tigers in exchange for Oliver Setzinger. Daigle played 25 games with the SCL Tigers in the 2009–10 season, with 7 goals and 17 assists for 24 points. Daigle ranked seventh on the team in points while playing in fewer than half as many games as the team&#x27;s other top scorers.

On March 23, 2010, Daigle and Davos agreed to have his contract reduced from five years to three years, making him a free agent after the 2009–10 season.

==Post-playing career==
Since the completion of his European hockey career, Daigle has worked in the movie industry, running studios for MTL Grandé.

==Personal life==
Daigle lives in Montreal with his wife and their three children.

<text>Lysterfield (Boonwurrung: &quot;Waralk-warrabin&quot;) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Melbourne CBD, located within the City of Knox and the Yarra Ranges Shire local government areas. Lysterfield recorded a population of 6,681 at the .

==History==

The area around Lysterfield was first settled in 1838. Initially it was part of Narre Warren but was named Lysterfield in 1874 when land was set aside for a primary school. At this time, Lysterfield included what is now Rowville. The land was primarily used for farming.

Lysterfield Road is one of the major blackspots in Victoria. When the Victorian State Government fixed it, it cost $2.3m. Further along that road is the City of Knox Avenue of honour, which was first planted in 1918–19 in recognition of First World War veterans. This is a group of pine trees.

A well-known attraction in Lysterfield is the Lysterfield Lake, built in 1929 by the State Rivers &amp; Water Supply Commission, to supply water to the Mornington Peninsula, Springvale, and Dandenong. Lysterfield Lake Park was established as a water catchment area surrounding the lake. Today, there are facilities for sailing, swimming, canoeing, mountain biking and walking. It is one-third in the City of Knox, the rest being in the Shire of Yarra Ranges and a small part in the City of Casey. This park includes a few ruins such as the Donlane and the Dargon homestead site, still with its surrounding orchards and the ruins of the dairy that is renowned as Boy&#x27;s Farm.

The February 2009 bushfires affected this area; homes were threatened but none were lost.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2021 census, 6,681 people lived in Lysterfield. The median age was 41 and the median weekly household income was . 26.1% of the population had a bachelor&#x27;s degree. 0.6% of the population identified as Indigenous. The most common non-English languages spoken at home include Mandarin (3.6%), Greek (1.6%), Italian (1.5%), Arabic (1.2%), and Sinhalese (1.1%).

==Agriculture==

Lysterfield is also a place where people raise alpacas, and grow many vegetables, including a large sprout farm. The centre of Lysterfield reflects its rural status, with a farm shop and a petrol station, which is advertised as &#x27;prime land&#x27;.

Lysterfield is home to the Salesians of Don Bosco Auxilium College, numerous equestrian trails and horse riding schools, the Lysterfield Christian Fellowship, and a quarry operated by Boral. There is a relatively new housing development in the north-west corner.

==Education==
There is one primary school in the area named Lysterfield Primary School (situated in Bellfield Drive, Lysterfield). However, the suburb is close to many primary and secondary schools in neighbouring suburbs.

<doc id="568895" wikidata="Q1365664" url="?curid=568895" title="Culpability">
<text>In criminal law, culpability, or being culpable, is a measure of the degree to which an agent, such as a person, can be held morally or legally responsible for action and inaction. It has been noted that the word, culpability, &quot;ordinarily has normative force, for in nonlegal English, a person is culpable only if he is justly to blame for his conduct&quot;. The guilt principle requires that in order to convict a person it is necessary to ascertain his voluntary or reckless behaviour, Strict Liability being prohibited.

==Etymology==

Culpability descends from the Latin concept of fault (&quot;culpa&quot;).

==Concept==
The concept of culpability is intimately tied up with notions of agency, freedom, and free will. All are commonly held to be necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for culpability.

==In law==
From a legal perspective, culpability describes the degree of one&#x27;s &quot;blameworthiness&quot; in the commission of a crime or offense. Except for strict liability crimes, the type and severity of punishment often follow the degree of culpability. &quot;Culpability means, first and foremost, direct involvement in the wrongdoing, such as through participation or instruction&quot;, as compared with responsibility merely arising from &quot;failure to supervise or to maintain adequate controls or ethical culture&quot;.

Modern criminal codes in the United States usually make distinct four degrees of culpability.

Legal definitions of culpability, from the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, are:
#A person acts purposely (criminally) with respect to a material element of an offense when:
##if the element involves the nature of his conduct or a result thereof, it is his conscious object to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result; and
##if the element involves the attendant circumstances, he is aware of the existence of such circumstances or he believes or hopes that they exist.
#A person acts knowingly with respect to a material element of an offense when:
##if the element involves the nature of his conduct or the attendant circumstances, he is aware that his conduct is of that nature or that such circumstances exist; and
##if the element involves a result of his conduct, he is aware that it is practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.
#A person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor&#x27;s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor&#x27;s situation.
#A person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor&#x27;s failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor&#x27;s situation.

In short:
* A person causes a result purposely if the result is his/her goal in doing the action that causes it,
* A person causes a result knowingly if he/she knows that the result is virtually certain to occur from the action he/she undertakes,
* A person causes a result recklessly if he/she is aware of and disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk of the result occurring from the action, and
* A person causes a result negligently if there is a substantial and unjustifiable risk he/she is unaware of but should be aware of.

The first two types of culpability are each a subset of the following. Thus if someone acts purposely, they also act knowingly. If someone acts knowingly, they also act recklessly.

The definitions of specific crimes refer to these degrees to establish the mens rea (mental state) necessary for a person to be guilty of a crime. The stricter the culpability requirements, the harder it is for the prosecution to prove its case.

For instance, the definition of first degree murder (again in Pennsylvania) is &quot;A criminal homicide constitutes murder of the first degree when it is committed by an intentional killing.&quot; Thus to be guilty of murder in the first degree, one must have an explicit goal in one&#x27;s mind to cause the death of another. On the other hand, reckless endangerment has a much broader requirement: &quot;A person commits a misdemeanor of the second degree if he recklessly engages in conduct which places or may place another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury.&quot; Thus to be guilty of this one only needs to be aware of a substantial risk he is putting others in danger of; it does not have to be one&#x27;s explicit goal to put people in risk. (But, if one&#x27;s goal &quot;is&quot; to put others in substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, this is, of course, sufficient.)

There is one more type of culpability, and that is &quot;strict liability&quot;. In strict liability crimes, the actor is responsible no matter what his mental state; if the result occurs, the actor is liable. An example is the felony murder rule: if the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that one commits a qualifying felony (see the article) during which death results, one is held strictly liable for murder and the prosecution does not have to prove any of the normal culpability requirements for murder.

<doc id="568897" wikidata="Q1800862" url="?curid=568897" title="Lake Bemidji">
<text>Lake Bemidji is a small glacially-formed lake, approximately in area, in northern Minnesota in the United States. Located less than downstream from the source of the Mississippi River, it both receives and is drained by the Mississippi, and is the northernmost point on the river.

==Name==
Lake Bemidji got its name because &quot;Bemidji&quot; refers to the Mississippi River, and how it flows across the lake from west to east. The word Bemidji means &quot;Lake with crossing waters&quot; and in its native Ojibwe it is &quot;Bemidjigamaag&quot;.

==Geography==

The lake is located in southern Beltrami County, near the city of Bemidji, which sits on its southwestern shore. Due to the shape of Lakes Bemidji and Irving, according to folk legends, Lakes Bemidji and Irving were formed in Paul Bunyan&#x27;s footprint. The Ojibwe described the Lakes Bemidji and Irving collectively as a single lake being a &quot;bimijigamaa&quot; (lake that traverses another body of water), thus the Ojibwe name the lake as &quot;Bemijigamaag-zaaga&#x27;igan&quot; (Traversing Lake), since the lake is considered to traverse the Mississippi River.

On occasion in Ojibwe, the city of Bemidji is called &quot;Wabigamaang&quot; (at the lake channel/narrows), since part of the city is situated on the Lakes Bemidji-Irving narrows, located on the south end of Lake Bemidji.

Lake Bemidji resides in the upper Mississippi River drainage basin. Over of the Upper Mississippi watershed drain into Lake Bemidji. The lake has roughly 15 miles of shoreline.

==Ecology==
The littoral zone of Lake Bemidji covers roughly 28% of the total lake area. There are no invasive species known in the lake as of 2017.

The water clarity (assessed using a Secchi disk) ranges from 2.5 to 21.0, with a maximum reading usually obtained in early summer. Transparency is high in May and June and declines through August. The transparency then rebounds in October after fall turnover. This transparency dynamic is typical of a northern Minnesota lake. The lake has been classified as eutrophic by the Beltrami County Soil and Water Conservation District.

There are many fish species that inhabit Lake Bemidji, including: black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, burbot, green sunfish, hybrid sunfish, lake whitefish, largemouth bass, Lepomis sp., muskellunge, northern pike, pumpkinseed, rock bass, tullibee (cisco), walleye, yellow bullhead, yellow perch, bowfin (dogfish), greater redhorse, redhorse, shorthead redhorse, white sucker, banded killifish, blackchin shiner, blacknose shiner, bluntnose minnow, brassy minnow, brook stickleback, central mudminnow, common shiner, fathead minnow, finescale dace, golden shiner, Iowa darter, Johnny darter, logperch, longnose dace, mimic shiner, spottail shiner, tadpole madtom.

==Early history==
The Beltrami County Historical Society documents that &quot;The first residents of the Bemidji area in recorded history were Native Americans who settled Northern Minnesota following the retreat of the glaciers around 10,000 years ago.&quot; Evidence of the retreating glaciers exists today in Bemidji’s lush wilderness, Lake Bemidji, and other bodies of water found within Beltrami County. As time progressed, the Bemidji area (as well as Lake Bemidji) became inhabited by different Native American tribes. First, the Dakota (who settled in the 1600s) followed by the Ojibwe in the 1700s. The Ojibwe would ultimately become the presiding tribe throughout the 1700s and into the 1800s.

== Chief Shaynowishkung ==
Historical leader Chief Shaynowishkung (Chief Bemidji) of the Ojibwe was born in 1834 and died in 1904. The Beltrami County Historical Society documents that &quot;Shaynowishkung&#x27;s people came from Madeline Island originally, moving to Sandy Lake, then Winnibigoshish, finally settling along the shore of Bemijigamaag.&quot; According to the plaques which are engraved near Shaynowishkung’s Honorary Statue (located near the south side of Lake Bemidji), the chief moved to Lake Bemidji in 1882 after the death of his wife. In 1888, he was first reported to have contact with neighboring white settlers. During their first meeting, the local namesake &quot;Chief Bemidji&quot; was wrongfully given by European immigrants due to what the Beltrami Historical Society documents as &quot;early miscommunication&quot; as when &quot;Shaynowishkung told them the name of the lake [Bemijigamaag], which they at first took to be his name&quot;. As a result, he became known &quot;throughout his life as Chief Bemidji.&quot;

== Logging Mills ==

As time progressed, the main economic source of the Bemidji area became logging mills. The Crookston Sawmill opened in 1903 and was located along the south shore of Lake Bemidji. The sawmill was one of the first prominent logging industries within the Bemidji area and soon expanded tremendously. In the year 1910, Crookston Sawmill had become the second largest sawmill in the country, expanding Bemidji’s economy (volume of business) to 18th within the state. Unfortunately, timber production made the sawmill prone to fire. The fires which took place at the sawmill during the 1910s and early 1920s which burned the mills to the ground twice foreshadowed the final fire of the newly rebuilt Crookston mill #1. According to Historian Rosemary Given-Amble, &quot;on November 8, 1924, 24 million board feet of select white pine, valued at $750,000, was destroyed at the second Crookston #1 fire. Heat was so intense it caused whirlwinds that tossed burning lumber across the lake.&quot;

== Drought ==

According to historian Rosemary Given Amble, &quot;The era between 1907-1910 brought years of drought and local forest fires to northern Minnesota. Because of that dryness the south and north basins of Lake Bemidji were often separated by a sandbar extending from Diamond Point to the east lakeshore, making it difficult to move log booms from the north end of the lake to the mill.&quot;

== Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox ==
The Beltrami Historical society accounts that &quot;Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox were commissioned to be built in 1936 and were unveiled January 15th 1937.&quot; Ever since, the 18 foot lumberjack and his faithful ox have christened the south shore of Lake Bemidji with their presence.

The Bemidji Chamber of Commerce documents that &quot;As some stories go, the idea of building a giant statue of the town’s lumberjack son was conceived over sharing a pint (or two). 737 man hours, and 2.5 tons later, a national tourism legend was proudly born. After more than 50 years of towering Lake Bemidji, the statues were officially honored by the National Park Service as a cultural resource worthy of preservation, adding them to the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox are recognized as the second most photographed roadside attraction in the nation.&quot;

== Recreation ==
The lake is a popular recreational and resort destination. Activities to do on and near the lake include fishing, boating, swimming, water-skiing, tubing, and hiking. Lake Bemidji State Park is along its northern shore. The north trailhead of Paul Bunyan State Trail is located at the state park and adjoins with 16.6 miles of paved trail which runs along the shores of the lake. Historian Rosemary Given-Amble also accounts that the lake is home to some of the largest parks in Bemidji including Diamond Point Park, Cameron Park, Library Park, and South Shore Park. Today, the lake is home to two resorts, a bed and breakfast, Lake Bemidji State Park campground, and multiple hotels situated along the south shore development. The south shore development is a growing infrastructure which is home to multiple businesses, housing complexes, South Shore park, and the Sanford Center.

<text>The woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis) is a tree kingfisher that is widely distributed in Africa south of the Sahara.

==Taxonomy==

The Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus included the woodland kingfisher with the binomial name &quot;Alcedo senegalensis&quot; in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; which was published in 1766. Linnaeus based his formal description on &quot;Le Grand Martin-Pescher du Sénégal&quot; that the French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson had described and illustrated in 1760. The current genus &quot;Halcyon&quot; was introduced by the English naturalist and artist William Swainson in 1821, with the woodland kingfisher as the type species.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;H. s. fuscopileus&quot; – Sierra Leone to south Nigeria and south to DR Congo and north Angola
* &quot;H. s. senegalensis&quot; – Senegal and Gambia to Ethiopia and north Tanzania
* &quot;H. s. cyanoleuca&quot; – south Angola and west Tanzania to South Africa

==Description==
This is a medium-sized kingfisher, in length. The adult has a bright blue back, wing panel and tail. Its head, neck and underparts are white, and its shoulders are black. The flight of the woodland kingfisher is rapid and direct. The large bill has a red upper mandible and black lower mandible. The legs and feet are dark grey. Some birds may have greyish heads, causing confusion with mangrove kingfisher.

However, the lores are dark, creating a dark stripe through the eye (the stripe does not extend through the eye in mangrove kingfisher), and the underwing, primaries and secondaries are black with white underwing coverts (there is a black carpal patch on the white coverts in mangrove kingfisher). The inner webs of the base of the flight feathers are white, creating an indistinct white wingbar (white completely absent from wings in mangrove kingfisher). The breast is white (tends to be much greyer in mangrove kingfisher). The sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults and have a brown bill.

The call of this noisy kingfisher is a loud trill sounding like a nail run down the teeth of a comb.

==Distribution and habitat==
The woodland kingfisher is widely distributed in tropical Africa south of the Sahara and from Pretoria northwards. This kingfisher is essentially resident within 8° of the equator, but northern and southern populations are migratory, moving into the equatorial zone in the dry season.

It is a common species of a variety of wooded habitats with some trees, especially Acacias, including around human habitation. Although it is a &quot;kingfisher&quot;, it prefers drier habitats in more traditional woodland and can be far from water. It is often solitary but can occur in small groups.
==Behaviour==
The woodland kingfisher is aggressively territorial, attacking intruders including humans. It has a striking display in which the wings are spread to show the white linings.

===Breeding===
The nest is a tree hole excavated by a woodpecker or barbet. A single clutch of three round white eggs is typical. The young are cared for by both parents for up to five weeks after leaving the nest. Woodland Kingfisher breeding in the Transvaal takes place from November until March, peaking in December and January.

===Feeding===
It hunts from an exposed perch, often on a dead branch of a tree, or perches quietly in semi-shade while seeking food.

===Interspecific relationships=== 
The medium-sized, electric-blue-backed kingfisher distribution overlaps almost everywhere with the Brown-hooded Kingfisher H. albiventris, and they frequently occur alongside each other. Although it is similar to the Mangrove Kingfisher in appearance, the two are largely allopatric, use different habitats and differ in diet.

<text>A suppository is a dosage form used to deliver medications by insertion into a body orifice (any opening in the body), where it dissolves or melts to exert local or systemic effects. There are three types of suppositories, each to insert into a different sections: rectal suppositories into the rectum, vaginal suppositories into the vagina, and urethral suppositories into the urethra of a male.

Suppositories are ideal for infants, elderly individuals and post-operative patients, who are unable to swallow oral medications, and for individuals experiencing severe nausea and/or vomiting.

==Composition==
Several different ingredients can be used to form the base of a suppository: cocoa butter or a similar substitute, polyethylene glycol, hydrogels, and glycerinated gelatin. The type of material used depends on the type of suppository, the type of drug, and the conditions in which the suppository will be stored.

==Rectal suppositories==

In 1991, a study on suppository insertion in &quot;The Lancet&quot; found that the &quot;torpedo&quot; shape helps the device to travel internally, increasing its efficacy. The findings of this single study have been challenged as there is insufficient evidence on which to base clinical practice. Rectal suppositories are intended for localized or systemic action to relieve pain, constipation, irritation, inflammation, nausea and vomiting, fever, migraines, allergies, and sedation. If they cause inflammation, chronic use of suppositories may cause rectal stricture, but overall this is a safe method of drug delivery. 

==Urethral suppositories==
Alprostadil pellets are urethral suppositories used for the treatment of severe erectile dysfunction (impotence). They are marketed under the name &quot;Muse&quot; in the United States. Its use has diminished since the development of oral impotence medications.

<text>Roman Hamrlík (born April 12, 1974) is a Czech former professional ice hockey defenceman who played 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was originally selected first overall in the 1992 NHL entry draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, the first-ever selection by the expansion franchise, beginning his career with the team and later playing for the Edmonton Oilers, New York Islanders, Calgary Flames, Montreal Canadiens, Washington Capitals, and New York Rangers. In total, he played 1,395 games during his NHL career and participated in three NHL All-Star Games, in 1996, 1999, and 2003.

Hamrlík also represented the Czech Republic on numerous occasions at the international level, including at the 1998 Winter Olympics, where he was part of the gold medal-winning Czech team. He also played in the 2002 Winter Olympics, as well as two Ice Hockey World Championships, in 1994 and 2004, and two World Cup of Hockey tournaments, in 1996 and 2004 World Cup of Hockey.

==Playing career==
Drafted first overall by the Tampa Bay Lightning in the 1992 NHL entry draft from ZPS Zlín, Hamrlík played as a defenceman who typically took on an offensive role for his team, especially on the powerplay. His offensive prowess earned him the role of the &quot;powerplay quarterback,&quot; as he often led the offense in a powerplay. After his draft, Hamrlík made the immediate leap to North America to play for the Lightning in the 1992–93 season. In 1995–96, he posted career-highs in goals (16), assists (49) and points (65). After five-and-a-half seasons with the organization, Hamrlík was traded to the Edmonton Oilers midway through the 1997–98 season.

Hamrlík was traded to the New York Islanders on June 24, 2000, in exchange for Eric Brewer, Josh Green, and a 2000 second-round pick. During the 2000–01 season, he would match his career-high in goals with 16.

Hamrlík signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Calgary Flames on August 14, 2005, to a two-year, $7 million contract. In 2006–07, he posted a career-high in plus-minus with +22. On July 2, 2007, again as a free agent, Hamrlík signed a four-year, $22 million contract with the Montreal Canadiens.

After four productive seasons with Montreal, Hamrlík signed as a free agent on a two-year, $7 million contract with the Washington Capitals on July 1, 2011. In his second season with Washington during the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, Hamrlik was limited to just four games as a reserve defenceman before he was ultimately placed on waivers by the team on March 5, 2013. He was claimed by the New York Rangers on March 6, 2013.

Hamrlík announced his retirement from professional ice hockey on October 21, 2013.

Hamrlík was inducted into the Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame on January 22, 2019.

==Personal life==
Hamrlík has an older brother, Martin Hamrlík, who was drafted by the Hartford Whalers in 1991, but never played in the NHL, and who spent the majority of his playing career in Czech Republic before retiring in 2013.

Hamrlík and his wife Cynthia have two children.

<doc id="568906" wikidata="Q1342371" url="?curid=568906" title="Owen Nolan">
<text>Owen Liam Nolan (born 12 February 1972) is a Northern Irish-born Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He was drafted first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. During his 18-year NHL career, he played for the Nordiques, Colorado Avalanche, San Jose Sharks, Toronto Maple Leafs, Phoenix Coyotes, Calgary Flames, Minnesota Wild, as well as playing a season with the ZSC Lions of National League A. Born in Belfast, he was raised in Thorold, Ontario and played for Canada internationally. A five-time NHL All-Star, Nolan is widely known as a power forward.

==Playing career==
===Minor hockey===
Nolan grew up in Thorold, Ontario playing minor ice hockey for Thorold in the OMHA. After playing A hockey for the Thorold bantam A&#x27;s Nolan was selected in the second round of the 1988 OHL Priority Selection by the Cornwall Royals of the Ontario Hockey League.

===Quebec Nordiques and San Jose Sharks===
Nolan was drafted first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. After a difficult rookie season at age 18 in 1990-91, when he tallied only 13 points, he burst out the next year with 42 goals and 73 points in 75 games. He was part of the franchise&#x27;s transfer to Denver where the Nordiques were rebranded as the Colorado Avalanche. He began the 1995–96 season with four goals and four assists in nine games for the Avalanche before being traded to the San Jose Sharks for Sandis Ozoliņš on 26 October 1995. During his tenure with the Sharks he was named captain, and registered his best career year in 1999–2000, finishing with 84 points, and tied for second in the NHL with 44 goals. During the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs, the eighth-seeded Sharks took out the first-seeded St. Louis Blues in seven games with Nolan leading the way with six goals. In game seven, Nolan scored with 10 seconds left in the first period from just past centre ice, beating goaltender Roman Turek to give the Sharks a 2–0 lead. The goal propelled them to a 3–1, game seven victory and first-round upset of the Blues.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
Nolan was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs just before the NHL trade deadline on 5 March 2003, for players Alyn McCauley and Brad Boyes, and Toronto&#x27;s first-round pick in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. However his performance in Toronto was disappointing, he suffered from a series of injuries and never played at the same level as he had in San Jose.

Nolan broke new ground in contract negotiations, having a clause put in that stated if the 2004–05 NHL season was cancelled, then he would gain a player option for an additional year in 2005–06. However, with the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement in place, this option became a topic of debate. With the new NHL salary cap, the Maple Leafs deemed Nolan&#x27;s salary too high, and refused to recognize Nolan as under contract. Nolan argued that the option was valid, that he would play, and be paid, for the Maple Leafs, and that he deserved to be paid during the 2004–05 NHL lockout due to injury. The Maple Leafs, who deemed Nolan as healthy just after the lockout, claimed that the injury was incurred off the ice and refused to pay Nolan&#x27;s desired US$12 million. The case went to an arbitrator. This case was settled in 2006, however, the terms of the agreement by Leafs management and Nolan were not disclosed. In 2005–06, Nolan took time off for his injured knees to heal, training in San Jose. Before the push for the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, Nolan indicated that several teams (including San Jose) wanted to sign him, but he decided not to play because he wanted to be at 100 percent, both because he did not want to become re-injured and because he felt he owed his team that.

===2006–2011===
In August 2006, during free agency, Nolan contemplated joining many teams before signing a one-year, US$1 million contract with the Phoenix Coyotes. He scored 16 goals to go with 24 assists during his only year in Phoenix before becoming a free agent once again.

On 2 July 2007, Nolan signed with the Calgary Flames. On 22 October, Nolan played his 1,000th NHL game. On 30 January 2008, Nolan had his 11th career hat trick and first hat trick since 1999 in a 5–4 victory over former team, the San Jose Sharks. He was honoured as the game&#x27;s first star as his hat trick included a short-handed goal and the game-winner, and Nolan also had a decisive victory in a second-period fight with Mike Grier. On 13 April, Nolan scored the game-winning goal in game three of the first round series of the 2008 Stanley Cup playoffs against his former team San Jose Sharks. It was his first playoff goal since 2002, when he was a member of the Sharks, and the 19th playoff goal of his 18-year career.

On 6 July 2008, Nolan signed a two-year, $5.5 million contract with the Minnesota Wild. On 10 March 2009, Nolan scored his 400th (and 401st) goal of his NHL career with the Wild against the San Jose Sharks.

A free agent before the 2010–11 season, and intending to continue his NHL career, Nolan was unable to secure an NHL contract. With the beginning of the season underway, to garner interest and keep in game condition, Nolan signed a one-month contract with the Swiss team, ZSC Lions of the National League A, on 21 October 2010. He then signed an extension with ZSC Lions until 23 January 2011.

On 4 August 2011, Nolan signed a tryout contract with the Vancouver Canucks, returning to the NHL after a year in Switzerland. He was then released by the Canucks on 25 September 2011, admittedly due to issues with his family.

===Retirement===
On 7 February 2012, Nolan announced his retirement, at a press conference in San Jose five days before his 40th birthday. He was then chosen for a ceremonial puck drop in a game against the Calgary Flames on 8 February.

===All-Star appearances===
Nolan has played in the NHL All-Star Game in 1992, 1996, 1997, 2000 and 2002. He was the runner-up to Mark Recchi for the All-Star Game MVP in 1997, during which he performed a memorable &#x27;called shot&#x27;, pointing to the top corner of the net on a breakaway and promptly scoring there against Dominik Hašek to complete a hat trick.

==Personal life==
Nolan is one of six players in NHL history to be born on the island of Ireland (Sid Finney, Bobby Kirk, Jim McFadden, Sammy McManus and Jack Riley are the others). Nolan&#x27;s Catholic family lived on the Falls Road but moved to Thorold, Ontario, when he was seven months old to avoid religious persecution during the Troubles. He grew up playing baseball and soccer; it was not until he was nine that he began skating. He attended Denis Morris Catholic High School in St. Catharines, Ontario.

Nolan owns two restaurants called Britannia Arms in San Jose, California. He and his wife have two children.

<doc id="568909" wikidata="Q305645" url="?curid=568909" title="William Levitt">
<text>William Jaird Levitt (February 11, 1907 – January 28, 1994) was an American real-estate developer and housing pioneer. As president of Levitt &amp; Sons, he is widely credited as the father of modern American suburbia. In 1998 he was named one of &quot;Time&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Most Influential People of the 20th Century.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Levitt was born in 1907 to a Jewish family in Brooklyn. His generation was the second since emigrating from Russia and Austria; the paternal grandparents who immigrated to the United States had been a rabbi grandfather from Russia and a grandmother from Austria-Germany. His father was Abraham Levitt, a Brooklyn-born real estate attorney and part-time investor; his mother was Pauline Biederman. A younger brother, Alfred, was born when William was five years old. William received a public school education at Public School 44 and Boys High School. He then attended New York University for three years, but dropped out before graduating.

== Levitt &amp; Sons ==
=== 1920s–1930s ===
In 1929, William&#x27;s father Abraham founded a real-estate development company called Levitt &amp; Sons. Levitt &amp; Sons built mostly upscale housing on and around Long Island, New York, in the 1930s. William Levitt served as company president, overseeing all aspects of the company except for the designs of the homes they built, which fell to William&#x27;s brother Alfred.

=== After World War II ===
During World War II, Levitt served in the Navy as a lieutenant in the Seabees. After returning from the war, he saw a need for affordable housing for returning veterans. America&#x27;s post-war prosperity and baby boom had created a crisis of affordable housing.

Even before returning from the war, Levitt experimented with mass housing projects, building a 1,600-home community in Norfolk, Virginia, which was not a success and housing units remained unsold in 1950.

=== Levittown housing developments===
Levitt progressed to become a pioneer of mass production. He had houses built in less than six weeks on inexpensive land with no urban infrastructure. Houses were built on concrete slabs, with no foundation, and could be purchased for as little as a one-dollar down payment.

Levitt &amp; Sons&#x27; first successful housing development was located on almost of land near Hempstead, Long Island and was named Levittown. The assembly line construction method enabled Levitt to build more efficiently than other developers at the time, with teams of specialized workers following each other from house to house to complete incremental steps in the construction.

Levitt reduced the cost of constructing houses by freezing out union labor. This provoked picket lines, but enabled him to use the latest technology, such as spray painting. Levitt also cut out middlemen and purchased many items, including lumber and televisions, directly from manufacturers, as well as constructing his own factory to produce nails. The building of every house was reduced to 27 steps, and sub-contractors were responsible for each step. His mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed Levitt to sell them, fully furnished with modern electric appliances, for as little as $8,000 each ($95,000 in 2024 dollars), which, with the G.I. Bill and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400.

Levitt was the cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine for July 3, 1950, with the tag line &quot;For Sale: a new way of life.&quot;

In 1952, people started buying over 17,000 Levitt-built homes in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. In addition, the company built Willingboro, New Jersey, which still has street names such as Levitt Parkway. During the late 1950s, Levitt and Sons constructed &quot;Belair at Bowie&quot; in Bowie, Maryland.

William had taken control of Levitt &amp; Sons in 1954 and the company went public in 1960. During the 1960s, when Levitt was leading the company, Levitt &amp; Sons developed properties beyond the American mainland, such as Levittown, Puerto Rico; Lésigny, France in Seine-et-Marne; and Mennecy in Essonne, France. In the early 1960s, the company built a 5,000-house community in north central New Jersey called Strathmore-at-Matawan.

===Personal fortune===
By the late 1960s, Levitt had become one of the richest men in America, with a fortune estimated in excess of $100 million (~$1 billion in 2024). He lived in a lavish 30-room mansion on his &quot;La Coline&quot; estate in Mill Neck, New York, and spent much of his time on &quot;La Belle Simone&quot;, his yacht named after his third wife.

===Racial segregation===
Levitt refused to integrate his developments. His sales contracts also forbade the resale of properties to blacks through restrictive covenants, although in 1957 a Jewish couple resold their house to the first black family to live in a Levitt home. Levitt&#x27;s all-white policies also led to civil rights protests in Bowie, Maryland in 1963. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union opposed Levitt&#x27;s racist policies, and the Federal Housing Administration prepared to refuse mortgages on his next Levittown. Nevertheless, Levitt would not back down and continued planning another whites-only Levittown in Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He fought legal challenges in New Jersey courts until the United States Supreme Court refused to hear his case.

The 2003 PBS series &quot;&quot;, by California Newsreel, features Levittown and nearby Roosevelt in documenting systemic racism in the development of the early suburbs.

Levitt has been criticized for his racially discriminatory policies when providing housing, which were especially discriminatory to African Americans, Jews, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans.

=== Company sale ===
After he had built over 140,000 houses around the world, then 60-year-old Levitt sold the company to ITT for $92 million ($ million today) in July 1967, of which $62 million was in the form of ITT stock. ITT made Levitt president of the renamed Levitt Corp., with a non-compete clause where Levitt could not found or be employed by another United States home building company for ten years. He entered the agreement thinking he would play an active role in ITT affairs, but executives felt Levitt was too old to take on more responsibility.

Levitt remained president under ITT until 1972. During that time he led the subsidiary&#x27;s development of housing projects in Palm Coast, Florida; Richmond, Virginia; and Fairfax, Virginia.

== Later years and death ==
After the restriction against Levitt moving to a new home building company in the United States expired, he was unable to repeat the success he had achieved with Levitt &amp; Sons. He established a series of companies and joint ventures through the 1970s and 1980s which failed. The ITT stock he often used for collateral on these ventures lost 90% of its value, saddling him with great debt.

The Levitt Corp. had its license to conduct business in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, revoked in October 1978 after building inspectors found more than 2,500 code violations in 122 homes of their latest subdivision, Northview.

He was accused of misappropriation of funds from the charitable Levitt Foundation and agreed to repay $5 million, more than $5 million or $11 million (in 1992).

Levitt died from kidney disease at a hospital in Manhasset, New York, on January 28, 1994, at the age of 86.

==Legacy==
William Levitt came to symbolize the new suburban growth with his use of mass-production techniques to construct large developments of houses, eponymously named Levittowns, selling for under $10,000. Many other relatively inexpensive suburban developments soon appeared throughout the country. While he did not invent the building of communities of affordable single-family homes within driving distance of major areas of employment, his innovations in providing affordable housing popularized this type of planned community in the years following World War II.

His nicknames included &quot;The King of Suburbia&quot; and &quot;Inventor of the Suburb.&quot; At his height, when he was completing one suburban house every 11 minutes, Levitt compared his successes to those of Henry Ford&#x27;s automobile assembly line. &quot;Time&quot; magazine recognized Levitt as one of the &quot;100 Most Important People of the 20th Century&quot; in 1998.

Levitt was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal in 1965.

==Personal life==

Levitt married Rhoda Kirshner in November 1929. Their son William Junior was born in 1932, and their second son, James, was born in 1944. The couple divorced in 1959, and, the same year, Levitt married his long-time mistress, Alice D. Kenny, an interior decorator at Levitt &amp; Sons, and adopted her two daughters from a previous marriage, Joanne Habermehl and Mariellen Habermehl. Ten years later, in 1969, Levitt divorced his second wife and married a French art dealer, Simone Korchin.

<doc id="568910" wikidata="Q5903953" url="?curid=568910" title="Horn Papers">
<text>The Horn Papers were a genealogical hoax consisting of forged historical records pertaining to the northeastern United States from 1765 to 1795. They were published by William Franklin Horn (1870–1956) of Topeka, Kansas, between 1933 and 1936, and presented as a transcription of documents of his great-great-great-grandfather, Jacob Horn (died 1778), and other members of the Horn family.

==Overview==
&quot;The Horn Papers&quot; first appeared publicly in 1932 in letters sent from Topeka to the editors of the Washington, Pennsylvania, &quot;Observer&quot; and the Waynesburg, Pennsylvania, &quot;Democrat-Messenger&quot; in which their author claimed to possess important historical documents relating to the area. From 1933 to 1936 the newspapers printed excerpts from Horn&#x27;s manuscripts and diaries. Horn even moved to his ancestral home of Waynesburg and through speeches became well known as an historical expert.

Material in the papers included diaries, Virginia court records, and maps. They were notable for their great level of detail, especially concerning the lives of the common people. Because the papers appeared to supply information about famous historical figures and to fill gaps in existing historical knowledge, they were received enthusiastically despite some apparent contradictions.

Although a minority opposed Horn, on August 11, 1936, his claims appeared to have been corroborated when he announced that he had dug up two lead plates dated 1795 in a location predicted by the papers.

The apparent find increased the confidence of members of the Greene County, Pennsylvania, Historical Society, who sponsored the reissuing of the papers in book form. In 1945 the papers were published as a three-volume collection entitled &quot;The Horn Papers: Early Western Movement on the Monongahela and Upper Ohio, 1765–1795&quot;.

A year later, a report by a committee of representatives of historical societies from the region concluded in &quot;The William and Mary Quarterly&quot; that the first two volumes were substantially hoaxes.

There is no conclusive explanation why W.F. Horn devoted such a great effort to the forgeries. &quot;Time&quot; magazine attempted to interview Horn in October 1947. According to their report, &quot;In Topeka last week, 77-year-old William Horn said nothing. His wife told newsmen that he had suffered a stroke. As to the &quot;Horn Papers&quot;, he was &#x27;no longer interested&#x27;.&quot;

<doc id="568911" wikidata="Q2148678" url="?curid=568911" title="Sexual penetration">
<text>Sexual penetration is the insertion of a body part or other object into a body orifice, such as the mouth, vagina or anus, as part of human sexual activity or sexual behavior in non-human animals.

The term is most commonly used in statute law in the context of proscribing certain sexual activities. Terms such as &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; or &quot;carnal knowledge&quot; are more commonly found in older statutes, while many modern criminal statutes use the term &quot;sexual penetration&quot; because it is a broad term encompassing (unless otherwise qualified) any form of penetrative sexual activity, including digital (i.e., the fingers) or with an object, and may involve only the most minimal penetration. Some jurisdictions refer to some forms of penetration as &quot;acts of indecency&quot;, or other terminology.

==Definitions==
When a penis is inserted into a vagina, it is generally called vaginal sex, vaginal intercourse, or penis-in-vagina (PIV) sex. When a penis penetrates another person&#x27;s anus, it is called anal sex or anal intercourse. 
Penetrative oral sex may involve penetration of the mouth by a penis (fellatio) or the use of the tongue to penetrate a vagina or vulva (cunnilingus). The tongue may also penetrate the anus during anilingus. If one or more fingers are used to penetrate an orifice, it is called fingering or digital penetration. The insertion of an object, such as a dildo, vibrator or other sex toy, into a person&#x27;s genital area or anus may also be considered sexual penetration. Penetrative sex is referred to as coitus or connotative sex.

==Unlawful==

Penetrative sex crimes are generally considered more serious than non-penetrative sex crimes, and sexual penetration of a child even more so. A child below the statutory age of consent cannot consent to acts involving sexual penetration. In laws, the term &quot;sexual penetration&quot; is commonly used in relation to sex with children. Unlawful sexual penetration is generally an offense irrespective of how deep the penetration was and irrespective of whether ejaculation of semen took place.

Laws may distinguish particular forms of sexual penetration as part of the offense. For example, the law in the U.S. state of Oregon provides:
In the United Kingdom, sexually penetrating a relative is an offense.

Various forms of penetration have at times been considered obscene and been prohibited. Works containing such penetrations may be considered pornography.

<doc id="568913" wikidata="Q1869069" url="?curid=568913" title="London SS">
<text>London SS is a British rock group founded in March 1975 by drummer Geir Waade, bassist John Brown, guitarist Mick Jones, and guitarist Eunan Brady (formerly of the Hollywood Brats). They later became associated with the then new punk rock scene when the Sex Pistols broke in early 1976. In 2012 Brady put together a new lineup, featuring himself along with Jimi McDonald, Taj Sagoo, Michael Kane, and Andi Emm.

==History==
The origin of the name &quot;London SS&quot; is disputable. Geir Waade claims to have been the first to propose it:

The group&#x27;s name caused disquiet in some quarters, because &quot;SS&quot; was generally understood to refer to the Schutzstaffel, the infamous paramilitary force of Nazi Germany, at a time when Nazi chic was a trend in UK pop. This came to haunt Mick Jones (who is Jewish) when The Clash became Britain&#x27;s premier left-wing political band. When questioned about the name, Tony James stated:

The London SS recruited Kelvin Cyril Blacklock to front their band. Blacklock&#x27;s arrival led to Geir Waade and Mick Jones&#x27;s departures. The band then changed its name to Violent Luck.

The second lineup of The London SS started with Blacklock and James.
The band spent most of their short history auditioning potential members. Besides Blacklock and James, guitarist Brian James (no relation to Tony James) was the only other semi-permanent member at this time. Other musicians who played with them included Matt Dangerfield and Casino Steel, then members of The Hollywood Brats, who would later go on to play in The Boys. Future Clash bassist Paul Simonon also auditioned for the group, albeit unsuccessfully.

==Recordings==
London SS&#x27;s only recording was a demo featuring James, Jones, James, and Hot. Musically, they played straightforward rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and covered 1960s R&amp;B. An example of this is their song &quot;1–2 Crush on You&quot;, which was later recorded by The Clash.

The reformed version did release a limited edition Demo CD, entitled &quot;High Jinks On A Low Budget&quot; which was sold at The Rebellion Festival in 2013, following their successful gig there.They also recorded an EP, whilst they were signed to the French label, Combat Rock Records. The E.P. is entitled &quot;No Beards, No Beerguts, No Beginners&quot;

==Later bands featuring members of The London SS==
Ultimately, The London SS members were more famous for what they did later than they were for anything that they accomplished during the band&#x27;s existence. As described by music critic Dave Thompson, the band is &quot;regarded as the testing ground-cum-meeting place for what became a who&#x27;s-who of punk&quot;.

Brian James and Rat Scabies joined Johnny Moped guitarist Ray Burns and backed up music journalist Nick Kent in the shortlived Subterraneans. James and Scabies later formed The Damned. Tony James joined the band Chelsea with Billy Idol and the two later started Generation X. According to Chelsea drummer John Towe,

Jones and Simonon teamed up with Joe Strummer and founded The Clash. 

Jones and Tony James later worked together in Carbon/Silicon.

===Early years===
Turgeon was a member of Canada&#x27;s team that was involved in the &quot;Punch-up in Piestany&quot;, a bench-clearing brawl between Canada and the Soviet Union during the final game of the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Piešťany, Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia) on January 4, 1987. He was the only Canadian who did not initially leave the bench until Canadian head coach Bert Templeton convinced him to go on the ice. Many of his teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: &quot;I&#x27;m looking for someone to help (Stéphane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. There&#x27;s this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn&#x27;t get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone&#x27;s off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed.&quot; Regarding not leaving the bench, Turgeon stated in 2017: &quot;that wasn&#x27;t my job. I didn&#x27;t have to fight.&quot; Two other players for Canada in forward Steve Nemeth and goalie Jimmy Waite also did not throw a punch.

===Buffalo Sabres===
Turgeon was drafted by the Buffalo Sabres as the first overall pick in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Rick Jeanneret, play-by-play announcer for the Sabres, coined the phrase &quot;Ooh-la-la Pierre&quot; for Turgeon.

Turgeon would quickly make an impact with the Sabres once he arrived. In his rookie season, he contributed a respectable 42 points (14 goals, 28 assists) during the 1987–88 season, helping the Sabres reach the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in three years. His production increased to 88 points (34 goals and 54 assists) for the 1988–89 season as he quickly became a fan favourite. In the 1989–90 season, he became a star by scoring 106 points (40 goals and 66 assists) and playing in the 1990 NHL All-Star Game. Turgeon&#x27;s production dipped a little bit in the 1990–91 season to 79 points (32 goals and 47 assists), but he was still a solid performer.

===New York Islanders===
On October 25, 1991, after over four years with the Sabres, Turgeon was traded (along with Benoît Hogue, Uwe Krupp and Dave McLlwain) to the New York Islanders in exchange for Pat LaFontaine, Randy Wood, Randy Hillier and future considerations. Turgeon&#x27;s best season as an Islander was in 1992–93, where he scored 58 goals and 132 points and helped lead the Islanders to the Wales Conference Finals, where they would lose to eventual Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens in five games. En route, the Islanders defeated the Washington Capitals and upset the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions Pittsburgh Penguins.

The first round series, which the Islanders won in six games, is infamous for an on-ice incident. After scoring a goal to put the Islanders up 5-1 during game six at Nassau Coliseum, Turgeon was checked from behind by Dale Hunter of the Capitals as he celebrated his goal. Turgeon suffered a separated shoulder and missed the first six games of the ensuing series against the Penguins. Hunter received a then-record 21-game suspension for the hit. In the semifinals against the Montreal Canadiens, Turgeon tallied five points in four games.
 The Islanders bowed out of the playoffs after a hard-fought five-game series, two of which went to overtime. After defeating the Islanders, the Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup.

As an Islander, Turgeon was awarded the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy in the 1992–93 season.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Following the 1994–95 NHL lockout in which the 1994–95 season was limited to 48 games, Islanders general manager Don Maloney decided to rebuild the team, which included trading Turgeon and Vladimir Malakhov to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for Kirk Muller, Mathieu Schneider and Craig Darby at the trading deadline. Turgeon would be named captain of the Canadiens for the 1995–96 season after the departure of Mike Keane to the Colorado Avalanche in December 1995. During the 1995–96 season, Turgeon would nearly record a 100-point season with 38 goals and 58 assists for 96 points; he would also play in the 1996 NHL All-Star Game.

===St. Louis Blues===
On October 29, 1996, Turgeon was traded to the St. Louis Blues (along with Rory Fitzpatrick and Craig Conroy) in exchange for Murray Baron, Shayne Corson and a fifth-round pick in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft. Turgeon spent the next five seasons producing well with the likes of Brett Hull, Chris Pronger, Al MacInnis and Grant Fuhr as teammates. He averaged more than 70 points per season and scored several key post-season goals during his tenure in St. Louis.

===Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche===
On July 1, 2001, Turgeon joined the Dallas Stars as a free agent, followed by the Colorado Avalanche as a free agent on August 3, 2005. Turgeon took a year off during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. Upon signing with the Avalanche, Turgeon switched his jersey number to #87 from his customary #77, as the number was retired by Colorado for Ray Bourque.

On November 8, 2005, Turgeon became the 34th player in NHL history to score 500 goals, doing so against the San Jose Sharks.

On September 5, 2007, Turgeon announced his retirement from the NHL.

==Post-playing career==
Turgeon was first considered for the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2010, but was not selected. In 2023, after 13 years of being eligible, Turgeon would be selected for the Hockey Hall of Fame, with him being inducted on November 13, 2023. Up until his selection, he was one of only 5 (Peter Bondra, Jeremy Roenick (later elected in 2024), Keith Tkachuk, and Pat Verbeek) eligible players with 500 goals to not be in the Hall of Fame. Also, at the time of his induction, he is the 9th (Dale Hawerchuk, Guy Lafleur, Mario Lemieux, Eric Lindros, Mike Modano, Gilbert Perreault, Denis Potvin, and Mats Sundin) enshrined player to have been a first pick in the NHL draft.

==Coaching career==
On July 10, 2017, Turgeon was named as the offensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Kings. On June 8, 2018, the Kings announced that they had accepted Turgeon&#x27;s resignation to leave the organization due to family reasons.

==Personal life==
Turgeon and his wife Elisabeth have four children and currently live in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado. One of their children, Elizabeth, died in a car accident on December 23, 2010, near Vaughn, New Mexico, at age 18. Turgeon represented Canada in the Little League World Series in 1982. Turgeon&#x27;s son Dominic was drafted 63rd overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. His daughter, Valérie Turgeon, was a forward for Harvard Crimson women&#x27;s ice hockey team, playing for two seasons.

==In popular culture==
George W. Strawbridge, Jr., an active shareholder of the Buffalo Sabres and director and member of the team&#x27;s executive committee for more than 30 years, named one of his thoroughbred racehorses in Pierre Turgeon&#x27;s honor. Turgeon raced for Strawbridge&#x27;s racing stable in France where he won several conditions races and, after retiring, is developing into a successful sire.

<text>The blue-breasted kingfisher (Halcyon malimbica) is a tree kingfisher widely distributed across Equatorial Africa. This kingfisher is essentially resident, but retreats from drier savanna areas to wetter habitats in the dry season.

This is a large kingfisher, 25 cm in length. The adult has a bright blue head, back, wing panel and tail. Its underparts are white, but it has a blue breast band. The shoulders are black. The flight of the blue-breasted kingfisher is rapid and direct. The large bill has a red upper mandible and black lower mandible. The legs are bright red.

Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller than adults. The call of this noisy kingfisher is a whistled &quot;pu-pu-pu-pu-ku-ku-ku-ku&quot;.

The blue-breasted kingfisher is a species of a variety of well-wooded habitats. It perches quietly in deep shade whilst seeking food. It is territorial but wary. This species mainly hunts large insects, arthropods, fish and frogs, but will also eat the fruit of the Oil Palm.

It has a striking display in which the wings are spread to show the white linings. The nest is a hole in a tree termite nest. A single clutch of two round white eggs is typical.

<text>The Undang Yang Empat (Negeri Sembilan Malay: &quot;Undang Nan Ompek&quot;; Jawi: أوندڠ يڠ امڤت) are the ruling chiefs or territorial chiefs who play an important role in the election of a new Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. The name is believed to be derived from the Malay word &quot;undang-undang&quot; meaning &quot;law&quot;.

The Minangkabau who settled at Negeri Sembilan, in present-day Malaysia at the end of the 17th century ruled by a &quot;penghulu&quot; or headman who was chosen from the noble families of Sakai and Jakun belonging to the Biduanda clan. These &quot;penghulus&quot;, notably that of Sungai Ujong, Jelebu, Johol and Rembau became powerful enough to exalt themselves above the other &quot;penghulus&quot;. These penghulus later acknowledged by the sultan of the old Johor Empire as a sovereign in their own territory. By the early part of the 18th century, the leaders of these four territories started using the title &quot;Undang&quot; to distinguish themselves from other &quot;penghulu luak&quot;.

Malaysia&#x27;s modern day constitution confirms the status of the Undang under Article 71, 160, 181 and the Eight Schedule of Federal Constitution as Malay Ruler within the Federation. Undangs are still chosen from amongst certain noble families in the state, the succession being both matrilineal and elective following the &quot;Adat Purbakala&quot;.

== History ==
According to Ernest Woodford Birch, the Undang Yang Empat trace their history and rank back to the four Batins (Sakai Chiefs) of Johol, Sungei Ujong, Jelebu and Klang, with Rembau later taking the position left vacant by Klang.

The ruling chiefs are selected among the nobility in each &quot;luak&quot; (district), following matrilineal inheritance, part of the state&#x27;s &quot;adat perpatih&quot; customs. 

* The Undang of Sungai Ujong is chosen among the Waris Klana di-Hulu and Waris Klana di-Hilir families of the noble House of Waris Klana and inherits the title &quot;Dato&#x27; Klana Petra&quot;.
* The Undang of Jelebu is elected among the three noble houses of Waris Ulu Jelebu, Waris Sarin and Waris Kemin, and inherits the title &quot;Dato&#x27; Mendika Menteri Akhirul Zaman&quot;.
* Undangs of Johol () are a succession of members of two families in the female line of either Perut Gemencheh or Perut Johol. The son of the eldest sister of the incumbent is usually the heir. He inherits the title &quot;Dato&#x27; Johan Pahlawan Lela Perkasa Setiawan&quot;.
* The Undang of Rembau alternates between the two major noble houses in the Luak, namely the Waris Jakun (who on accession inherits the title &quot;Dato&#x27; Lela Maharaja&quot;) and the Waris Jawa (&quot;Dato&#x27; Sedia Raja&quot;). As with the Undang of Johol, the son of the eldest sister of the incumbent is the heir in the family.

=== Current ruling chiefs ===
The senior wife of an Undang has the honorific title of &quot;To&#x27; Puan&quot; or &quot;&quot;Toh Puan&quot;.&quot;

==Duties==

The Undangs carry out duties such as co-head of state, co-head of Islam as state religion, upholding and safeguarding the special position of Bumiputera in Negeri Sembilan, attending the state opening of the legislative assembly and electing the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan, who is also the co-head of state of Negeri Sembilan. The Undangs themselves cannot stand for election and their choice of ruler is limited among the princes of Seri Menanti royal family who are:

* Muslim male
* Malay
* a &quot;lawfully begotten descendant of &quot;.

<text>Seri Menanti (Negeri Sembilan Malay: or ) is a town, a mukim, and a state assembly constituency in Kuala Pilah District, central Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia, located 33 km (20.5 m) east of the state capital city of Seremban and 14 km (8.7 m) southwest of Kuala Pilah. It is the royal capital of the state of Negeri Sembilan and houses the seat of the ruler of the state of Negeri Sembilan, referred to as the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan or Yamtuan Besar. The royal palace is known as &quot;Istana Besar&quot; (Grand Palace).

Seri Menanti is situated in a valley surrounded by the verdant rolling hills of the Negri Titiwangsa. The area in which Seri Menanti is located is known as the Adat Circle (Malay: &quot;Adat Lingkungan&quot;). Seri Menanti also governs the surrounding chiefdoms (known locally as &quot;luak&quot;) of Terachi, Gunung Pasir, Ulu Muar, Jempol, and Ineh, collectively known as &quot;&quot;.

==History==

The Minangkabau people migrated to the wider area of Negeri Sembilan during the 14th century as part of the Minang practice of &quot;merantau&quot;. Around the 15th century, the Minangkabau moved further inland from Rembau to the area that is modern-day Seri Menanti. Among the explorers were Datuk Puteh of Pagar Ruyung. According to legend, the explorers found three stalks of fresh green paddy and thus Datuk Puteh christened the area &quot;Padi Menanti&quot; (literally &quot;awaiting paddy&quot;). Over time, the name changed to &quot;Seri Menanti&quot;. It is believed that the word &quot;seri&quot; corresponds to the Goddess of rice in the ancient Javanese tradition (Javanese: &quot;Sri&quot;).

Raja Melewar arrived in Negeri Sembilan in 1773 and was proclaimed the first &quot;Yamtuan Besar&quot; in Kampung Penajis in Rembau. He later moved his palace to Seri Menanti, which remains to this day the royal capital of Negeri Sembilan.

==Notable and historical landmarks==

Completed in 1932, the official palace of the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar Negeri Sembilan is the Istana Besar. The palace complex consists of the Main Palace, the Throne Room (Balairong Seri), and the Royal Banquet Hall.

The old wooden palace, known as &quot;Istana Lama&quot;, was built and officiated during the reign of &quot;Yang Di-Pertuan Besar&quot; Tuanku Muhammad Shah ibni Almarhum Tuanku Antah (who reigned between 1888–1933). It was made in part of Chengal (Penak) wood &quot;Neobalanocarpus&quot; and ironwood or &quot;belian&quot; wood (Eusideroxylon zwageri) and held together using only wooden pegs. The palace took six years to build and was completed in 1908 at a cost of $45,000.00 at that time. The design has subtle hints of Minangkabau architecture; five levels rise to a height of 67 feet, or approximately twenty meters. The palace has 99 columns to support the main structure. The Istana Lama was a replacement for the Istana Pulih, which was burned down by British soldiers. The drawings and plans for Istana Lama were detailed by a Mr. Woodford of the Public Works Department, and based on the designs provided by two local craftsmen, Kahar and Taib. This palace was used until 1932, after which the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar moved to the Istana Besar. The Istana Lama has been designated as a national heritage site and was converted into a Royal Museum in 1992.

Other landmarks include the Seri Menanti Royal Mausoleum.

==Surrounding area==
Among the villages in the area are Kampung Tanah Datar, Kampung Tengah, Kampung Gamin, Kampung Istana Lama, Kampung Sikai, Kampung Buyau, Kampung Batu Hampar, Kampung Mertang Seberang, Kampung Merual, Kampung Galau, Kampung Masjid Terbakar, Kampung Padang Biawas, Kampung Jumbang, Kampong Gunung Pasir, and others. A few traditionally styled houses, derivative of the Minangkabau design Rumah Gadang, remain standing around Seri Menanti and in the adjacent villages. A significant portion of the land in Seri Menanti is Malay Reserve and Malay Customary Land (Malay: ).

==The Tunku Besar of Seri Menanti==

The incumbent Tunku Besar of Seri Menanti is Tunku Ali Redhauddin, the eldest son of the Yang Di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan Tuanku Muhriz ibni Almarhum Tuanku Munawir. The title of Tunku Besar Seri Menanti is the most senior of the Putera Yang Empat (Four Princes). This is the third time in 120 years that the Tunku Besar Seri Menanti has been appointed.

==Heritage==

In February 2009, the Unity, Culture, Arts and Heritage Minister Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal announced that the Istana Lama Seri Menanti is among ten historical structures in Malaysia gazette as a national heritage, along with Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur and The Stadthuys in Malacca.

<text>Kesatuan Melayu United Kingdom (&quot;KMUK&quot; or the Malay Union of United Kingdom) was formed in 1965 by Malay students studying in the United Kingdom. Its main aim was to nurture nationalism amongst the younger Malay intellectuals. Established to support and connect Malaysians, particularly those of Malay descent, studying or residing in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1965, KMUK aims to promote cultural awareness, provide social support, and foster a sense of community among its members.
Several key initiators of the KMUK ended up as major figures in the struggle for independence against the British colonial power. The first president of KMUK, Tuanku Abdul Rahman ibni Almarhum Tuanku Muhammad, became Malaya&#x27;s first King or Yang di-Pertuan Agong. His secretary (and eventual successor), Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, became first Prime Minister of Malaya and later of Malaysia.

<doc id="568930" wikidata="Q5171574" url="?curid=568930" title="New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University">
<text>The New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University (ILR) is an industrial relations school and one of the four statutory colleges at Cornell University. The school has five academic departments which include: Labor Economics, Human Resource Management, Global Labor and Work, Organizational Behavior, and Statistics &amp; Data Science.

Established by the state legislature in 1945, the school is a statutory or contract college through the State University of New York (SUNY) system and receives funding from the State of New York. It was the world&#x27;s first school for college-level study in workplace issues and remains as one of the leading institutions for industrial relations. In addition to its undergraduate curriculum, the school offers professional and doctoral degrees, as well as executive education programs.

In Fall 2016, the School received 1,925 freshman applications and accepted 235 students (12.2% acceptance rate).

==History==
===20th century===
In 1944, a coalition of leaders in American business, industry, labor, government, and education formed to establish the school. They believed that a new type of school was needed that focused on issues involving the American workplace.

More specifically, the State Legislature established the school in 1945 based on the recommendations of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee on Industrial and Labor Conditions. This committee was headed by Irving M. Ives and was originally formed in 1938. Ives, along with others in the committee, determined that a fundamental dysfunction in the relationship between management and labor was that each group brought different technical information and skills to the negotiating table and that these differences were hindering the formation of mutually favorable outcomes. The committee’s response to this observation was to recommend that the state of New York provide &quot;a common training program&quot; for representatives of labor and management. The committee stressed that the importance of such a training program is &quot;not merely attendance at the same institution or in the same school, but rather mutual and cooperative analysis of the problems common to both groups.&quot; Indeed, a quote from the committee’s 1943 report adds, &quot;The Committee believes [however] that a state-sponsored school in this state should be based upon a broader educational philosophy. One of the most important ways of improving industrial and labor relations is to bring together, in a common training program, representatives of both labor and industry.&quot;

It was the committee’s recommendation to provide common training to leaders from all perspectives of the management-labor debate. It was hoped that this common training would stabilize the negotiating table by producing leaders on all sides who have common technical information and competencies. In 1942 the committee recommended that ILR be established at Cornell (the state’s land grant institution). Two years later, formal legislative action was taken and Governor Dewey approved establishing the school. 

On July 1, 1945, ILR became a going educational enterprise, charged with the mission &quot;to improve industrial and labor conditions in the State through the provision of instruction, the conduct of research, and the dissemination of information in all aspects of industrial, labor, and public relations, affecting employers and employees.&quot;

Ives was the first dean of the school. However, soon after gaining this title he became a United States Senator for New York and left for Washington. Beginning in the summer of 1947, Martin P. Catherwood became the dean. The school was also championed by then-President of Cornell University, Edmund Ezra Day. The state of New York provided the school with generous funding. However, due to time constraints, the school soon moved into quonset huts on the Ithaca campus and later into buildings vacated by the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine.

In 1960, enrollment in the ILR school was reported to consist of 300 undergraduates and 60 graduates.

Milton R. Konvitz, who was a labor-law expert, was a founding faculty member and remained active until his death in 2003. Frances Perkins, who served as Secretary of Labor for 12 years under Franklin D. Roosevelt, joined the faculty and served until her death in 1965.

The school offered the first 4-year degree (B.S.) in the field of industrial and labor relations. Originally, students had ninety-seven of the required 120 hours prescribed for them. The first two years consisted of many social science classes such as American history and government, sociology, psychology, economics, and law. Students were required to take English and public speaking courses as well as courses in accounting and statistics. The last two years of coursework were the technical core: classes that were expected to provide the students with the technical skills and competencies which enable them to develop professional expertise within the field of industrial and labor relations. Examples of these courses include: history of labor and labor-union organization and management, business organization and management, and corporate finance. Beyond the classroom, students were expected to gain applied experience. This was achieved primarily through a required summer work-training program. To fulfill this expectation, students would spend three of their summers working in the field for each of the following types of organizations: industrial or commercial, government, and labor.

===21st century===
In 2012, ILR opened the International HRM Academy in collaboration with King&#x27;s College London.

==Campus==
Between its founding in 1945 and 1960, the school was housed in temporary quarters in quonset huts on the engineering quadrangle. Original plans called for an I&amp;LR school to be built behind Phillips Hall on part of Hoy Field, but these plans were rejected by school alumni. Between 1959 and 1961, a new ILR quadrangle was constructed using state funds on land formerly occupied by the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine. Three Veterinary College buildings including James Law Hall were demolished in September 1959. Four existing Veterinary college buildings were renovated. Of these, the 1911 building housing the ILR Conference Center (and renamed King-Shaw Hall in 2012) is listed on the register of historic structures.

The main campus occupies a quad near the center of Cornell, comprising an academic building, a research building, an extension building, a conference center, and a library. Ives Hall, named after ILR founding dean Irving Ives, is the academic building and is divided into a classroom/student wing and a faculty wing. The student wing houses separate lounges for undergraduate and graduate students. Also on the quad is the Martin P. Catherwood Library, which is one of only two official depository libraries of the International Labour Organization (the other being the Library of Congress). The ILR Conference Center, with its distinctive belfry atop, hosts special training sessions and recruiting events and offices for the United Auto Workers. The research building houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution as well as offices for the &quot;ILR Review&quot;. The extension building, renamed Dolgen Hall in 2008, houses the Yang Tan Institute. All of these buildings are owned by New York State on land that Cornell conveyed to the state.

In 1998, New York State replaced the portion of Ives Hall fronting along Tower Road with a new building. Recently, the State also renovated the faculty wing of Ives Hall at a cost of $14 million, and in 2004, New York State completed extensively renovations of three other campus buildings. 

The 1911 building which houses the ILR Conference Center was rededicated as Patricia G. and Rubén Jose King-Shaw, Jr. Hall in 2012.
===New York City and other locations===

ILR occupies 40,000 square feet of space in the General Electric Building at 570 Lexington Avenue in New York City for almost 100 staff. Seven ILR institutes and programs are based here, including the R. Brinkley Smithers Institute for Alcohol-Related Workplace Studies, The Worker Institute, ILR Executive Education, the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution, the Labor and Employment Law Program, the Institute for Compensation Studies and the Institute for Workplace Studies. The 12th floor features a conference center and space for meetings, receptions, and classes.

ILR also has campuses in Albany, New York, Buffalo, New York, and Rochester, New York.

==Organization and degree programs==

The school is divided into six departments: Labor Relations, Law and History; Human Resource Studies; International and Comparative Labor; Economics; Organizational Behavior; and Social Statistics.

===Undergraduate programs===
While most such schools offer only masters and PhD degrees in human resources or labor relations, Cornell is one of a few that offer a four-year undergraduate program focused on work and employment, the B.S. in Industrial and Labor Relations (BSILR). All students are required to complete a 120 credit hour curriculum with the following general requirements: First-year students are required to complete two writing seminars, Introduction to Organizational Behavior, Introduction to U.S. Labor History, as well as Introductory Microeconomics and Introductory Macroeconomics. Sophomore year students have the following course requirements: Introductory Statistics, Labor and Employment Law, Human Resource Management, Labor Relations, Economics of Wages and Unemployment, and an advanced writing course. Junior and Senior level students are required to take 24 credits from within the school&#x27;s six departments. An additional 16 credits may be taken outside the school. Additionally, there is a physical education requirement of two classes. In 2016, 10 percent of undergraduates went on to attend law school and seven percent earn an MBA or other advanced degree. In 2010, of the 911 undergraduates, 406 (45%) were New York State residents at the time they matriculated. New York residents pay a reduced in-state tuition.

The school also sponsors a chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). The school&#x27;s undergraduate contingent has claimed the national title at SHRM&#x27;s &quot;HR Games&quot; twice—in 2002 and 2004. In 2011, a &quot;Cornell Daily Sun&quot; article rated ILR the &quot;Sexiest Major&quot; at Cornell: &quot;The dreamy look in their eyes and the business-casual attire on their backs... They are the students who would have been in AEM except for the fact that they have souls. These students’ passion for the underdog and stunning good looks make ILR, hands down, the number one sexiest major at Cornell.&quot;

Undergraduates have a number of internship opportunities, including semester-long for-credit internships. The school also sponsors non-credit internships over the January break or during the summer. Students can also participate in the Arts College&#x27;s Cornell-in-Washington program. Students in the top 20% of their junior class can write a senior thesis and thereby graduate with honors.

Graduate-level degrees offered through the Graduate School include the Master of Industrial and Labor Relations (MILR), the dual MILR/Master of Business Administration (MBA) (joint with the Johnson School), the Master of Professional Studies (MPS), the Executive Master of Human Resource Management, the Master of Science (MS) in Labor Research &amp; Policy, and the M.S./Ph.D.

Graduate students may also complete a semester abroad or a one-year-additional dual-degree Master in Management from ESCP Europe at any one of its campuses: Paris, Torino, Berlin, Madrid, or London. The school&#x27;s contingent has claimed the title at the National MBA Human Capital Case Competition five times (the most of any school)—2007, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.

===Certificate programs===
Through eCornell the school offers over 90 professional development certificate programs through online provision.

<text>Tengku Alam Shah, Tengku Ali Iskandar Shah was a prince of the House of Bendahara (Johor), and was the oldest son of Sultan Ali, the 19th Sultan of Johor by his second wife, Daing Siti. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1877, Tengku Alam and his supporters made an active pursuit to his claims for the Kesang territory and was publicly proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor and Pahang with the regnal name of Alauddin Alam Shah during his marriage ceremony in 1879.

The proclamation briefly alarmed Maharaja Abu Bakar, who feared that his political position may be threatened. Within the same year, a brief civil war erupted in Jementah, after repeated attempts to get his claims to the Kesang territory being recognised failed.

==Succession dispute==
Sultan Ali&#x27;s third son by Cik Sembuk, Tengku Mahmud was groomed for succession. When the Sultan died in 1877, he nominated Tengku Mahmud to inherit the Kesang territory. The Sultan&#x27;s decision took Tengku Alam and his supporters in Singapore to anger, who felt that Tengku Alam should inherit his father&#x27;s properties given that he was the eldest son. Furthermore, Cik Serimbuk&#x27;s commoner background stood out against Daing Siti&#x27;s, who was the daughter of a Bugis nobleman.

The British on their part, refused to recognise Sultan Ali&#x27;s will on his son&#x27;s (Tengku Mahmud) hereditary claims to the Kesang territory. Meanwhile, the chieftains and village headmen in the Kesang territory held their own elections for a new leader, and voted for the Maharaja of Johor, Abu Bakar to take charge of Muar, which the British accepted the outcome of the poll. The Acting Governor of the Straits Settlement, Edward Anson, allowed Abu Bakar to take interim control over the Kesang territory.

Tengku Alam and his supporters were extremely unhappy with Maharaja Abu Bakar&#x27;s intervention over the Kesang territory. A long time of Tengku Alam, W.H. Read helped to lobby in Tengku Alam&#x27;s cause. Supporters of Tengku Alam had criticised the irregularities in the electoral process, by claiming that the Maharaja had coerced the Muar chiefs into voting for him prior to the election, and called for an election with Tengku Alam&#x27;s family members as the electors. Tengku Alam&#x27;s supporters argued that the 1855 secession treaty which Sultan Ali had signed with Temenggong of Johor guaranteed the hereditary rights of Sultan Ali&#x27;s family members to the Kesang territory. Tengku Alam&#x27;s claims were fell on deaf ears, and the British government, with the assistance of Engku Mandak, proceeded with the electoral process into 1878. Meanwhile, the British authorities allowed Tengku Alam to inherit the $500 monthly allowance which Sultan Ali had received from the Temenggong&#x27;s family, and gave him an additional $68 monthly allowance from the British East India Company. An angry Tengku Alam was declined these allowances from the British, and was said to have used abusive language when they were offered to him.

The following January, on 11 January 1879, a few hundred Bugis and Malay supporters proclaimed Tengku Alam with the title of &quot;Sultan Alauddin &#x27;Alam Shah, Sultan of Johor and Pahang&quot; during his marriage ceremony. Tengku Alam&#x27;s proclamation briefly generated serious concern from Maharaja Abu Bakar and the British government, who feared that Abu Bakar&#x27;s political position could be a sign of a potential threat to his political position, especially after Tengku Alam had made a public declaration to challenge Abu Bakar for his claims to the Kesang territory. In October, a frustrated Tengku Alam and his supporters launched a civil war in Jementah which was quickly subdued by the British authorities.

==Last years and death==
Tengku Alam returned to Singapore and lived out his remaining years quietly at Istana Kampong Glam, where he died in 1891. He was recognised as the head of the royal household by his family members, and occasionally handled administrative affairs pertaining to the royal household. Five years after his death, members of the royal family disputed over inheritance rights of Istana Kampong Glam in Court. The Istana was recognised as state property, but the British government (and later the Singapore government) quietly allowed members of the royal household to live in it until the 1990s.

<text>Sebastian Inlet State Park is a Florida state park located 10 miles south of Melbourne Beach and 6 miles north of Vero Beach in Florida. The park lies on both sides of the Sebastian Inlet, which forms the boundary between Brevard and Indian River counties. The land for the park was acquired by the state of Florida in 1971. In 2010, it was the second most visited state park in Florida.

==Geography==
The park occupies on the barrier island on the Atlantic coast of Brevard County, at a point where a channel links the Indian River intracoastal waterway with the Atlantic. Part of the park is south of the inlet on North Vero Beach in Indian River County

==History==
A Spanish fleet was wrecked in this area in 1715. The site where the survivors camped was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on August 12, 1970, under the title of Spanish Fleet Survivors and Salvors Camp Site. Today, the McLarty Treasure Museum (a part of the park) exhibits artifacts relating to the wreck.

==Recreational activities==
The park mainly provides leisure activities, particularly fishing from both its Atlantic and Indian River shores; fishing jetties extend from both sides of the inlet into the ocean. There are facilities for swimming, surfing, snorkeling and scuba diving from the of Atlantic beach. Boats can be launched into the Indian River, and there is a marina complex at the north end of the park. Camping is permitted in a designated area.

Wildlife is abundant in the park, and the casual visitor can reasonably hope to see ospreys and many species of shorebird. Sea turtles nest in the park, and visitors during the summer may make reservations for a nighttime foray to observe nesting loggerhead turtles. The park also contains two museums: McLarty Treasure Museum and Sebastian Fishing Museum.

A tidal pool (Robert Campbell Cove) within the state park contains varied marine and bird life and permits a safe area for swimming and a beach for children.

==Hours==
Unlike many state parks, Sebastian Inlet is open 24 hours per day.

<doc id="568942" wikidata="Q584586" url="?curid=568942" title="International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea">
<text>The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972, also known as &quot;Collision Regulations&quot; (&quot;COLREGs&quot;), are published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and set out, among other things, the &quot;rules of the road&quot; or navigation rules to be followed by ships and other vessels at sea to prevent collisions between two or more vessels. COLREGs can also refer to the specific political line that divides inland waterways, which are subject to their own navigation rules, and coastal waterways which are subject to international navigation rules. They are derived from a multilateral treaty called the &quot;Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea&quot;, also known as Collision Regulations of 1960.

Although rules for navigating vessels inland may differ, the international rules specify that they should be as closely in line with the international rules as possible. In most of continental Europe, the Code Européen des Voies de la Navigation Intérieure (CEVNI, or the European Code for Navigation on Inland Waters) apply. In the United States, the rules for vessels navigating inland are published alongside the international rules.

== Organization of the regulatory documents ==
As of 2022, there are 41 Rules and four annexes in COLREGs Rules in force.

===PART A - GENERAL===

Rule 1 - Application. This rule states that the COLREGs should be complied with by all vessels on the &quot;high seas&quot;.

Rule 2 – Responsibility. This rule allows Master mariners and other persons in charge of vessels to depart from the rules to &quot;avoid immediate danger&quot;, provided there are special circumstances for doing so. The rule also effectively requires all navigators to exercise good seamanship in applying the rules.

Rule 3 – General Definitions. This rule sets out key definitions that apply to terms in the rest of the rules, including definitions for &#x27;power-driven vessels&#x27;, &#x27;sailing vessels&#x27; and other terms such as &#x27;not under command&#x27; and &#x27;vessel restricted in her ability to manoeuvre.

===PART B - Section I Conduct of Vessels in any Condition of Visibility===

Rule 4 – Application. This rule sets out a requirement for all vessels to proceed at a safe speed with reference to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. Relevant circumstances include, for example, the state of visibility, the presence of other ships (traffic), as well as the draught and manoeuvrability of the mariner&#x27;s own ship. This rule states that the rules in this section apply to all vessels in any condition of visibility.

Rule 5 – Look-out. This rule concerns the keeping of a proper lookout to sea. It involves keeping the lookout by all available means, including audible means, visual means and by the use of marine radar.

Rule 6 – Safe Speed. This rule sets out a requirement for all vessels to proceed at a safe speed with reference to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. Relevant circumstances include, for example, the state of visibility, the presence of other ships (traffic), as well as the draught and manoeuvrability of the mariner&#x27;s own ship.

Rule 7 – Risk of Collision. This rule requires all vessels to use all available means to determine if a risk of collision exists. These include the proper use of marine radar and the taking of bearings by ship&#x27;s compass to determine if there is a steady bearing and risk of collison.

Rule 8 – Action to Avoid Collision. This rule sets out requirements for vessels to alter course and/or speed to pass a safe distance with other vessels. It requires alterations to be consistent with the concept of good seamanship, as well as be sufficient to be observed by the other vessel, ie, a large and bold angle of course alteration. The rule is designed to work in operation with other rules, including Rules 16 and 17.

Rule 9 – Narrow Channels. This rule concerns those vessels keeping a course within narrow channels and fairways. It requires vessels less than 20 metres in length, fishing vessels and sailing vessels to not impede the passage of larger vessels in the narrow channel. It also gives reference to signals (sound and light) that can be given to allow vessels to overtake one another if following the narrow channel or fairway, as well as a separate signal when approaching a bend. Vessels are also not allowed to anchor unless there are legitimate circumstances for doing so.

Rule 10 – Traffic Separation Schemes. Typically abbreviated to TSS by mariners, these schemes aim to promote the safety of navigation by ensuring ships follow a general direction of travel within defined traffic lanes. The TSS lanes are shown on paper and electronic charts and by monitoring their position, a ship can determine their navigation within the scheme. Additionally, a TSS provides separation zones and inshore-traffic zones, to which restrictions apply. Additional restrictions also apply to some vessel types, such as fishing vessels and vessels less than 20m in length to not impede the safe passage of other/larger vessels.

===PART B - Section II Conduct of Vessels in Sight of One Another===

Rule 11 - Application

Rule 12 – Sailing Vessels. The rule details how two or more sailing vessels should give way to each other when meeting. This is based on the wind direction. When each sailing vessel has the wind on a different side, the vessel which has the wind on the port side should keep out of the way of the other. Alternatively when both sailing vessels have the wind on the same side, the vessel which is to windward should keep out of the way of the vessel which is to leeward. Finally, if a vessel with the wind on the port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on her port or starboard side, they should keep out of the way of the other, ie they take action to make the situation safe regardless of knowing for sure the wind situation of the other vessel.

Rule 13 – Overtaking. This rule governs overtaking situations between different vessels. The primary requirement is that for all overtaking vessels, they must keep clear of the vessels they are overtaking. For sailing vessels Rule 13 also takes precedence over rules 12 and 18 meaning the overtaking sailing vessel must keep clear.

Rule 14 – Head-on Situation. This rule requires power-driven vessels that meet head-on ie bow directly facing another bow, to both alter course to starboard so as to pass clear of each other. This is referred to as passing &#x27;port to port&#x27; as the port sides separate away from each other as vessels alter. The rule effectively assigns equal responsibility to vessels to prevent collision.

Rule 15 – Crossing Situation. This rule concerns actions for vessels in crossing situations and essentially requires a vessel that has another vessel on their starboard (right hand) side to stay out of the way of the other, becoming the give way vessel under rule 17. The other vessel is required to stand-on under rule 17. Also, if the circumstances of the case admit, the vessel that has the other on their starboard side should avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.

Rule 16 – Action by Give-way Vessel. This rule requires the give-way vessel to take early and substantial action to keep well clear of the other vessel.

Rule 17 – Action by Stand-on Vessel. Rule 17 requires the stand-on vessel to maintain their course and speed. However, if it appears that the other vessel who is required to give way is not taking action, then they may take action to avoid collision according to certain requirements having been met.

Rule 18 – Responsibilities Between Vessels. Rule 18 effectively establishes an order of priority between all vessels and modes of operation of those vessels. For power-driven vessels operating normally, these type of vessels are required to keep clear of all other vessels, including sailing and fishing vessels. However, where vessels are subject to restrictions such as not under command, constrained by draft or restricted in their ability manoeuvre, then other vessels, including other power-driven vessels, sailing vessels and fishing vessels are either required to keep out of the way or not impede their passage, depending on the requirements.

===PART B - Section III Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility===

Rule 19 – Conduct of Vessels in Restricted Visibility. This rule governs collision avoidance for vessels not in sight of another when navigating in or near an area of restricted visibility. Causes include fog, smoke and other phenomena such as heavy precipitation. The rule requires all vessels to proceed at a safe speed adapted to the conditions and to effectively take action to avoid collision in ample time. As far as possible, vessels should avoid altering to port for vessels forward of their beam unless being overtaken and avoid altering course towards a vessel abeam or abaft the beam. For ships that have heard another vessels sound signal but not observed them on radar, part e requires the ship to reduce speed to the minimum required to maintain their course and if necessary to take all way off.

===PART C - Lights and Shapes===
Rule 20 – Application

Rule 21 – Definitions

Rule 22 – Visibility of Lights. The minimum visible distance requirements of navigational lights are detailed under this rule. These vary according to the length of the vessel. For example, for vessels greater than 50 metres in length, the visibility ranges of lights are 6 miles for masthead lights, 3 miles for sidelights, 3 miles for the sternlight, 3 miles for towing lights and 3 miles for an all round light.

Rule 23 – Power-driven Vessels Underway

Rule 24 – Towing and Pushing

Rule 25 – Sailing Vessels Underway and Vessels Under Oars

Rule 26 – Fishing Vessels

Rule 27 – Vessels Not Under Command or Restricted in their Ability to Manoeuvre

Rule 28 – Vessels Constrained by their Draught

Rule 29 – Pilot Vessels

Rule 30 – Anchored Vessels and Vessels Aground

Rule 31 – Seaplanes

===PART D - Sound and Light Signals===

Rule 32 – Definitions

Rule 33 – Equipment for Sound Signals

Rule 34 – Manoeuvring and Warning Signals

Rule 35 - Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility

Rule 36 - Signals to Attract Attention

Rule 37 - Distress Signals

PART E - Exemptions

Rule 38 - Exemptions

PART F - Verification of Compliance with the Provisions of the Convention

Rule 39 - Definitions

Rule 40 - Application

Rule 41 - Verification of Compliance

===Annexes===

ANNEX I - Positioning and Technical Details of Lights and Shapes

ANNEX II Addition Signals for Fishing Vessels Fishing in Close Proximity

ANNEX III : Technical Details of Sound Signal Appliances

ANNEX IV Distress Signals. The annex lists the official international distress signals. These include signals such as the spoken word &quot;Mayday&quot;, the Code flag Signal &quot;N.C. (November Charlie)&quot;, flares showing red lights, &quot;SOS&quot; in morse code&quot;, an orange smoke signal and others.

==History==
Prior to the development of a single set of international rules and practices, separate practices and various conventions and informal procedures existed in different parts of the world. As a result, there were inconsistencies and contradictions between navigation lights that gave rise to unintended collisions, including not least that many sailing vessels did not display navigation lights. Vessel navigation lights for operating in darkness as well as navigation marks were also not standardised, giving rise to dangerous confusion and ambiguity between vessels resulting in collisions and groundings.

With the advent of steam-powered ships in the mid-19th century, conventions for sailing vessel navigation had to be supplemented with conventions for power-driven vessel navigation. Sailing vessels are limited as to their manoeuvrability in that they cannot sail directly into the wind and are limited in the absence of wind. On the other hand, ships propelled by machinery can manoeuvre in all 360 degrees of direction and therefore can be manoeuvred irrespective of the wind conditions.

In 1840 in London, Trinity House drew up a set of regulations which were enacted by Parliament in 1846. The Trinity House rules were included in the Steam Navigation Act 1846, and the Admiralty regulations regarding lights for steam ships were included in this statute in 1848. In 1849 Congress extended the light requirements to sailing vessels on US waters. In the UK in 1858 coloured sidelights were recommended for sailing vessels and fog signals were required to be given, by steam vessels on the ship&#x27;s whistle and by sailing vessels on the fog horn or bell, while a separate but similar action was also taken in the United States as by 1850 onwards, English maritime law on collisions was being gradually adopted in United States law. Also in 1850, courts in the England and the United States adopted common law pertaining to reasonable speed within the Assured Clear Distance Ahead.

In 1863 a new set of rules drawn up by the British Board of Trade, in consultation with the French government, came into force. By 1864 the regulations (or Articles) had been adopted by more than thirty maritime countries, including Germany and the United States (passed by the United States Congress as &quot;Rules to prevent Collisions at Sea.&quot; An act fixing certain rules and regulations for preventing collisions on the water. 29 April 1864, ch. 69. and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln). International regulations would continue to be further developed over the next several decades as a result of legislative and government action by the UK, US and other maritime States. For example, in 1867, Thomas Gray, assistant secretary to the Maritime Department of the Board of Trade, wrote &quot;The Rule of the Road&quot;, a pamphlet that became famous for its well-known mnemonic verses. Furthermore, in 1878, the United States codified its common law rules for reducing the risk of collisions. By 1880, the 1863 international Articles were supplemented with whistle signals and in 1884 a new set of international regulations was implemented.

In 1889, the United States convened the first international maritime conference in Washington, D.C to further codify international collision regulations, including requirements for lights and shapes. The resulting rules were adopted in 1890 and effected in 1897. Some minor changes were made during the 1910 Brussels Maritime Conference and some rule changes were proposed, but never ratified, at the 1929 International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea (S.O.L.A.S.) With the recommendation that the direction of a turn be referenced by the rudder instead of the helm or tiller being informally agreed by all maritime nations in 1935.

The 1948 S.O.L.A.S. International Conference made several recommendations, including the recognition of radar; these were eventually ratified in 1952 and became effective in 1954. Further recommendations were made by a SOLAS Conference in London in 1960 which became effective in 1965.

===The 1972 International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea===

The &quot;International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea&quot; were adopted as a convention of the International Maritime Organization on 20 October 1972 and entered into force on 15 July 1977. They were designed to update and replace the Collision Regulations of 1960, particularly with regard to Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS) following the first of these, introduced in the Strait of Dover in 1967. As of June 2013, the convention has been ratified by 155 states representing 98.7% of the tonnage of the world&#x27;s merchant fleets.

The international regulations have been amended several times since their first adoption. In 1981 Rule 10 was amended with regard to dredging or surveying in traffic separation schemes. In 1987 amendments were made to several rules, including rule 1(e) for vessels of special construction; rule 3(h), vessels constrained by her draught and Rule 10(c), crossing traffic lanes. In 1989 Rule 10 was altered to stop unnecessary use of the inshore traffic zones associated with Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS). In 1993 amendments were made concerning the positioning of lights on vessels. In 2001 new rules were added relating to wing-in-ground-effect (WIG) craft and in 2007 the text of Annex IV (Distress signals) was rewritten.

The 2013 amendments (resolution A.1085(28))
Adoption: 4 December 2013
Entry into force: 1 January 2016
After existing part E (Exemptions), a new part F (Verification of compliance with the provisions of the Convention) is added in order for the Organization to make necessary verifications under the IMO Member State Audit Scheme.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) convention, including the almost four dozen &quot;rules&quot; contained in the international regulations, must be adopted by each member country that is signatory to the convention—COLREG laws must exist within each jurisdiction. Thereafter, each IMO member country must designate an &quot;administration&quot;—national authority or agency—for implementing the provisions of the COLREG convention, as it applies to vessels over which the national authority has jurisdiction. Individual governing bodies must pass legislation to establish or assign such authority, as well as to create national navigation laws (and subsequent specific regulations) which conform to the international convention; each national administration is thereafter responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the regulations as it applies to ships and vessels under its legal authority. As well, administrations are typically empowered to enact modifications that apply to vessels in waters under the national jurisdiction concerned, provided that any such modifications are not inconsistent with the COLREGs.

===Canada===
The Canadian version of the COLREGs is provided by Transport Canada, which regulates Canadian vessels.

===Korea===
South Korea ratified the COLREGs in 1977 and enacted enforcing legislation under the 1986 Korea Marine Traffic Safety Act.

===Marshall Islands===
For Marshall Islands waters and ships, Chapter 22.11.4 requires all vessels to comply with the 1972 COLREGs, as amended. Section 150 of the Maritime Act encompasses the fitting and provision of navigation lights, shapes and sound signalling equipment.

===Singapore===
The version of the COLREGs applicable to the territorial waters of Singapore is the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Collisions at Sea) Regulations. These Rules were enacted by Singapore in 1983 and then revised and reissued 25 March 1992.

===United Kingdom===
The UK version of the COLREGs is provided by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), in the &quot;Merchant Shipping (Distress Signals and Prevention of Collisions) Regulations of 1996.&quot; They are distributed and accessed in the form of a &quot;Merchant Shipping Notice&quot; (MSN), which is used to convey mandatory information that must be complied with under UK legislation. These MSNs relate to Statutory Instruments and contain the technical detail of such regulations. Material published by the MCA is subject to Crown copyright protection, but the MCA allows it to be reproduced free of charge in any format or medium for research or private study, provided it is reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context.

===United States===
The US version of the COLREGs is provided by the United States Coast Guard of the US Department of Homeland Security.

==No right-of-way==
A commonly held misconception concerning the rules of marine navigation is that by following specific rules, a vessel can gain certain rights of way over other vessels. No vessel ever has &quot;right of way&quot; over other vessels. Rather, there can be a &quot;give way&quot; vessel and a &quot;stand on&quot; vessel, or there may be two give way vessels with no stand on vessel. A stand on vessel does not have any right of way over any give way vessel, and is not free to maneuver however it wishes, but is obliged to keep a constant course and speed (so as to help the give way vessel in determining a safe course). So standing on is an obligation, not a right, and is not a privilege. Furthermore, a stand on vessel may still be obliged (under Rule 2 and Rule 17) to give way itself, in particular when a situation has arisen where a collision can no longer be avoided by actions of the give way vessel alone. For example, two power-driven vessels approaching each other head-to-head, are &quot;both&quot; deemed to be &quot;give way&quot; and both are required to alter course so as to avoid colliding with the other. Neither vessel has &quot;right of way&quot;.

==Future==
In recent years, the IMO, States and other interested parties have assessed the COLREGs with a view to potential future amendment to facilitate Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships. These include a regulatory scoping exercise to review the applicability of the COLREGs for autonomous ships.

==Racing Rules==
The Racing Rules of Sailing, which govern the conduct of yacht and dinghy racing under the sanction of national sailing authorities which are members of World Sailing, are based on the COLREGs, but differ in some important matters such as overtaking and right of way close to turning marks in competitive sailing.

<text>Swarthmoor is a small village near Ulverston, in Cumbria, England. Located on the Furness peninsula, it was historically part of Lancashire.

==Etymology==
Swarthmoor Village was named after its location on the Swarth Moor, which was formerly a marsh-covered moorland. The Swarth Moor&#x27;s name was derived from the word &quot;sweart&quot;, meaning black.

==History==
Before 1850 there were just a few farmsteads on Swarth Moor, and Swarthmoor Hall, which is located to the east of today&#x27;s village. George Fox (1624–1691), a founder of the Quakers, came to the area in 1652 and was later allowed by Judge Thomas Fell (1598–1658) to use Swarthmoor Hall as a meeting place. Fox later purchased land from the Swarthmoor Estate to build Swarthmoor Friends&#x27; Meeting House. The modern village of Swarthmoor grew in the mid-19th century, with houses built to accommodate the workers from nearby iron ore mines, particularly the Lindal Moor Mines. Some of the houses in Fox Street were built by John Bolton (&#x27;Old Daddy Bolton&#x27;), who was a surveyor and geologist. As the village grew in size it joined with the hamlets of Cross-a-Moor and Trinkeld. In 1883 a reading room on Fox Street was opened by Lord Muncaster, as a place for local miners to read newspapers – the Reading Rooms building is now used by village organisations, its upper floor is the church of St Leonard.

==Swarthmoor Hall==
Situated on the outskirts of the village is Swarthmoor Hall, where in 1652 George Fox founded the Quaker movement.

==Facilities in Swarthmoor==
Swarthmoor is home to Swarthmoor Social Football Club Founded in 1946, the club has two adult teams who play in the Furness Premier League. The Junior set-up was re-formed in 2005 and has over 200 children playing ranging from 4 to 16 years old.

There is a public house in the village – The Miners Arms.

<doc id="568951" wikidata="Q2703445" url="?curid=568951" title="Cranwell's horned frog">
<text>Cranwell&#x27;s horned frog (&quot;Ceratophrys cranwelli)&quot;, also called commonly the Chacoan horned frog, is a terrestrial frog in the family Ceratophryidae. The species is endemic to the dry Gran Chaco region of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. It, like other members of its genus, &quot;Ceratophrys&quot;, is commonly called the Pac-man frog, because of its resemblance to the video game character of the same name. Most adult specimens range from long and can weigh up to .

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;cranwelli&quot;, is in honor of Argentinian herpetologist .

==Description==

The back of &quot;C. cranwelli&quot; usually has dark green and brown coloration, although albino variants with orange and yellow coloration also exist and are popular in the pet trade. The dark color scheme aids in camouflaging the animal as it burrows and waits for its prey. Though generally inactive, it is an aggressive eater and is capable of leaping for several body lengths to capture prey. It uses its sticky tongue to latch onto prey and its heavy body to remain anchored while consuming prey.

==Diet and behavior==
Cranwell&#x27;s horned frog is nocturnal and rests with its eyelids open. It is ordinarily carnivorous, feeding mostly on insects and like-sized animals such as rodents, and is known to cannibalize other frogs. Large individuals have bite forces comparable to those of mammalian predators. Although it is capable of eating animals almost half its size, Cranwell&#x27;s horned frog sometimes eat things larger than itself. Its bite force is able to immobilize its prey, despite its being half the size of the prey. However, due to a row a teeth along the upper jaw, it is unable to release prey from its mouth causing it to potentially die by choking.

==Temperature control==
At extreme temperatures (both high and low), Cranwell&#x27;s horned frog enters a period of estivation, developing a thick layer of protective skin to trap moisture and aid in respiration. When estivation is complete, the frog uses its front and hind legs to help shed the protective layer. In many cases, the frog uses its jaws to help pull the skin over its back, often eating the skin in the process.

==As pets==
Like many Pacman frogs, Cranwell&#x27;s horned frog is very popular as a pet. As such, it should be kept in a humid environment such as an aquarium with moist substrate (not gravel). It should be fed a mixed diet of gut-loaded crickets, earthworms, small mice, and feeder fish. As a rule of thumb, it should be fed every 1–2 days until the age of 18 months, at which point it should be fed once every 4–7 days. It is also a good practice to dust prey items with an appropriate calcium and multi-vitamin supplement to prevent the development of metabolic bone disease. Supplementation should take place 2-3 times per week when young and once a week for an adult frog. Cranwell&#x27;s horned frog does not require a UVB source to survive but it may aid in calcium absorption. 

Because of its large mouth, &quot;C. cranwelli&quot; is particularly susceptible to impaction especially when young, a condition whereby the frog&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract is obstructed by a foreign body accidentally swallowed. The foreign body can be almost anything, but in Pacman frogs kept as pets, it is commonly a small rock or piece of gravel used as substrate. Impaction often leads to constipation and malnutrition, and possibly death unless treated promptly with laxatives such as the osmotic diuretic lactulose. In severe cases, the volume of feces in the intestines is so large that the lungs are obstructed and the frog&#x27;s breathing is impaired. Surgery may be required in the case of severe or chronic impactions.

<doc id="568960" wikidata="Q135463" url="?curid=568960" title="Coccoloba">
<text>Coccoloba is a genus of about 120–150 species of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae, which is native to the Neotropics. There is no overall English name for the genus, although many of the individual species have widely used common names.

==Range==
The genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, in South America, the Caribbean and Central America, with two species extending into Florida.

==Description==

The species are shrubs and trees, and lianas, mostly evergreen. The leaves are alternate, often large (to very large in some species; up to 2.5m (8 feet) long in &quot;C. gigantifolia&quot;), with the leaves on juvenile plants often larger and of different shape to those of mature plants. The flowers are produced in spikes. The fruit is a three-angled achene, surrounded by an often brightly coloured fleshy perianth, edible in some species, though often astringent. Species in the genus have been characterized as dioecious, but this is unclear. Trioecy has been documented in &quot;C. cereifera&quot;.

<text>Edward Cuthbert Platt (February 14, 1916 – March 19, 1974) was an American actor widely known for his portrayal of the Chief in the 1965–1970 NBC/CBS television series: &quot;Get Smart&quot;. With his deep voice and mature appearance, he played an eclectic mix of characters over the span of his career.

==Early life and military service==
Platt was born in Staten Island, New York. He spent a part of his childhood in Kentucky and upstate New York, where he attended the Northwood School, a private school in Lake Placid, and was a member of the ski jump team. He also studied at the Juilliard School. He attended Princeton University, but left after his freshman year. He served in the United States Army during World War II. Before becoming an actor, he sang for two years with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.

==Acting career==

An operatically trained bass-baritone with a powerful voice, he debuted on Broadway in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;Allegro&quot;. José Ferrer, who performed with Platt in the Broadway play &quot;The Shrike&quot;, helped him land his first film role in the 1955 film version. Also in 1955, Platt appeared in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; starring James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo.In 1957 he had a supporting role in “Designing Woman” with Gregory Peck and Lauren Bacall. He returned to Broadway in 1958 with the musical &quot;Oh, Captain!&quot;, in a romantic role. In 1959, he played Cary Grant&#x27;s attorney in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and he starred in the movie &quot;The Rebel Set.&quot;

Platt also appeared in episodes of the original &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (&quot;The Case of the Slandered Submarine&quot; and &quot;The Case of the Larcenous Lady&quot;); &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Trackdown&quot;, &quot;State Trooper&quot; (in the episode &quot;Who Killed Doc Robbins&quot;), &quot;Men into Space&quot; (&quot;From Another World&quot;), &quot;Ripcord&quot; (&quot;Million Dollar Drop&quot;), &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;One Step Beyond&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot; (S5 E7 &quot;The Assailants&quot; as Sen. Bordon 1962), &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; (&quot;The Man with the Power&quot; and &quot;Keeper of the Purple Twilight&quot;), &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (&quot;A Nice Friendly Game Of Cards&quot;), &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot; (in the 1959 episode &quot;Incident in Leadville&quot;), &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;

Platt was widely known for his role as The Chief in the espionage parody television series &quot;Get Smart&quot; (1965–1970). After it ended, he had a recurring role in the situation comedy series &quot;The Governor &amp; J.J.&quot; in 1970. He had guest roles in several other television series of the era, mostly comedies, including &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; as Oscar Madison&#x27;s boss in the episode &quot;Oscar&#x27;s New Life&quot;.

Platt appeared as Sotto Voce in the 1969 KCET television reading of Norman Corwin&#x27;s 1938 radio play &quot;The Plot to Overthrow Christmas&quot;.

==Work as producer==
In 1973, Platt raised the money to produce one of the first independent feature films shot entirely on videotape: &quot;Santee&quot;, starring Glenn Ford. His crew shot the production with electronic TV cameras and portable video tape recorders, then had the images transferred to film for theatrical release. The movie was not commercially successful. 

==Death==
Platt was found dead in his Santa Monica apartment on March 19, 1974, at the age of 58. Initial reports indicated the cause of death was a heart attack, but Platt&#x27;s son later said that his father died from suicide after a long struggle with untreated depression.

<doc id="568962" wikidata="Q777433" url="?curid=568962" title="Forward chaining">
<text>Forward chaining (or forward reasoning) is one of the two main methods of reasoning when using an inference engine and can be described logically as repeated application of &quot;modus ponens&quot;. Forward chaining is a popular implementation strategy for expert systems, business and production rule systems. The opposite of forward chaining is backward chaining.

Forward chaining starts with the available data and uses inference rules to extract more data (from an end user, for example) until a goal is reached. An inference engine using forward chaining searches the inference rules until it finds one where the antecedent (If clause) is known to be true. When such a rule is found, the engine can conclude, or infer, the consequent (Then clause), resulting in the addition of new information to its data. 
Inference engines will iterate through this process until a goal is reached.

==Example==

Suppose that the goal is to conclude the color of a pet named Fritz, given that he croaks and eats flies, and that the rule base contains the following four rules:

# If &quot;X&quot; croaks and &quot;X&quot; eats flies - Then &quot;X&quot; is a frog
# If &quot;X&quot; chirps and &quot;X&quot; sings - Then &quot;X&quot; is a canary
# If &quot;X&quot; is a frog - Then &quot;X&quot; is green
# If &quot;X&quot; is a canary - Then &quot;X&quot; is blue

Let us illustrate forward chaining by following the pattern of a computer as it evaluates the rules.
Assume the following facts:
* Fritz croaks
* Fritz eats flies

With forward reasoning, the inference engine can derive that Fritz is green in a series of steps:

1. Since the base facts indicate that &quot;Fritz croaks&quot; and &quot;Fritz eats flies&quot;, the antecedent of rule #1 is satisfied by substituting Fritz for &quot;X&quot;, and the inference engine concludes:
 Fritz is a frog

2. The antecedent of rule #3 is then satisfied by substituting Fritz for &quot;X&quot;, and the inference engine concludes:
 Fritz is green

The name &quot;forward chaining&quot; comes from the fact that the inference engine starts with the data and reasons its way to the answer,
as opposed to backward chaining, which works the other way around.
In the derivation, the rules are used in the opposite order as compared to backward chaining.
In this example, rules #2 and #4 were not used in determining that Fritz is green.

Because the data determines which rules are selected and used, this method is called data-driven, in contrast to goal-driven backward chaining inference. The forward chaining approach is often employed by expert systems, such as CLIPS.

One of the advantages of forward-chaining over backward-chaining is that the reception of new data can trigger new inferences, which makes the engine better suited to dynamic situations in which conditions are likely to change.

== Applications ==

Forward chaining is a powerful reasoning strategy with numerous applications in AI and related fields. Some of the prominent applications include:

* Expert Systems: Expert systems are AI systems that mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in a specific domain. They rely on forward chaining to apply expert knowledge to solve problems and make recommendations.
* Diagnosis and Troubleshooting: Forward chaining is extensively used in medical diagnosis and troubleshooting systems, where the input symptoms and test results are used to determine potential causes and treatments.
* Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Educational software often employs forward chaining to adapt to students’ progress and provide customized learning paths and feedback.
* Decision Support Systems: Forward chaining is utilized in business and management decision support systems to analyze data and recommend actions or strategies.
* Natural Language Processing: In natural language processing, forward chaining can be applied to resolve ambiguities in language and extract useful information from text.

In cities with high property prices, such as London, basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space.

In British English, the word &quot;basement&quot; is usually used for underground floors of, for example, department stores. The word is usually used with buildings when the space below the ground floor is habitable and with (usually) its own access. The word &quot;cellar&quot; applies to the whole underground level or to any large underground room. A &quot;subcellar&quot; or &quot;subbasement&quot; is a level that lies below the basement or cellar.

==Purpose, geography, and history==
A basement can be used in almost exactly the same manner as an additional above-ground floor of a house or other building. However, the use of basements depends largely on factors specific to a particular geographical area such as climate, soil, seismic activity, building technology, and real estate economics.

Basements in small buildings such as single-family detached houses are rare in wet climates such as Great Britain and Ireland where flooding can be a problem, though they may be used in larger structures. However, basements are considered standard on all but the smallest new buildings in many places with temperate continental climates such as the American Midwest and the Canadian Prairies where a concrete foundation below the frost line is needed in any case, to prevent a building from shifting during the freeze-thaw cycle. Basements are much easier to construct in areas with relatively soft soils and may be avoided in places where the soil is too compact for easy excavation. Their use may be restricted in earthquake zones, because of the possibility of the upper floors collapsing into the basement; on the other hand, they may be required in tornado-prone areas as a shelter against violent winds. Adding a basement can also reduce heating and cooling costs as it is a form of earth sheltering, and a way to reduce a building&#x27;s surface area-to-volume ratio. The housing density of an area may also influence whether or not a basement is considered necessary.

Historically, basements have become much easier to build (in developed countries) since the industrialization of home building. Large powered excavation machines such as backhoes and front-end loaders have dramatically reduced the time and manpower needed to dig a basement as compared to digging by hand with a spade, although this method may still be used in the developing world.

For most of its early history, the basement took one of two forms. It could be little more than a cellar, or it could be a section of a building containing rooms and spaces similar to those of the rest of the structure, as in the case of basement flats and basement offices.

However, beginning with the development of large, mid-priced suburban homes in the 1950s, the basement, as a space in its own right, gradually took hold. Initially, it was typically a large, concrete-floored space, accessed by indoor stairs, with exposed columns and beams along the walls and ceilings, or sometimes, walls of poured concrete or concrete cinder block.

==Types==
===English basement===

An English basement, also known as a daylight basement or lower ground floor, is contained in a house where at least part of the floor goes above ground to provide reasonably-sized windows. Generally, the floor&#x27;s ceiling should be enough above ground to provide nearly full-size windows. Some daylight basements are located on slopes, such that one portion of the floor is at-grade with the land. A walk-out basement almost always results from this.

Most daylight basements naturally result from raised bungalows and at-grade walk-out basements. However, there are instances where the terrain dips enough from one side to another to allow for 3/4 to full-size windows, with the actual floor remaining below grade.

In most parts of North America, it is legal to set up apartments and bedrooms in daylight basements, whether or not the entire basement is above grade.

Daylight basements can be used for several purposes—as a garage, as maintenance rooms, or as living space. The buried portion is often used for storage, laundry room, hot water tanks, and HVAC.

Daylight basement homes typically appraise higher than standard-basement homes, since they include more viable living spaces. In some parts of the US, however, the appraisal for daylight basement space is half that of ground and above ground level square footage. Designs accommodated include split-foyer and split-level homes. Garages on both levels are sometimes possible. As with any multilevel home, there are savings on roofing and foundations.

===Walk-out basement===
A walk-out basement is any basement that is partially underground but nonetheless allows egress directly outdoors and has floating walls. This can either be through a stairwell leading above ground, or a door directly outside if a portion of the basement is completely at or above grade.

Many walk-out basements are also daylight basements. The only exceptions are when the entire basement is nearly entirely underground, and a stairwell leads up nearly a floor&#x27;s worth of vertical height to lead to the outdoors.

Generally, basements with only an emergency exit well do not count as walk-out. Walk-out basements with at-grade doors on one side typically are more costly to construct since the foundation is still constructed to reach below the frost line. At-grade walk-out basements on the door-side are often used as livable space for the house, with the buried portion used for utilities and storage.

===Subbasement===
A subbasement is a floor below the basement floor. In the homes where there is any type of basement mentioned above, such as a look-out basement, all of the volume of the subbasements from floor to ceiling are located well below ground. Therefore, subbasements have no windows nor an outside door. In the homes that have subbasements, all of the basement can be used as part of the main home where people relax and do recreational things, while all of the subbasement can be used for storage. Subbasements are much more common in larger structures, such as commercial buildings and larger apartment buildings, than they are in single family homes. It is common for skyscrapers to have multiple subbasements.

Building a subbasement is more difficult, costly, and time-consuming than building a basement as the lowest floor. Subbasements are even more susceptible to flooding and water damage than basements and are therefore rare, except in dry climates and at higher elevations.

Some famous landmarks contain subbasements. The subbasement of the US Capitol Building is used as storage and that in the White House is used to store guest items.

===Finished fully underground cellar===
According to the international &quot;Oxford Dictionary of English&quot;, a finished fully underground cellar is a room below ground level in a house that is often used for the storage of wine or coal; it may also refer to the stock of wine itself. A cellar is intended to remain at a constant cool (not freezing) temperature all year round and usually has either a small window/opening or some form of air ventilation (air/draught bricks, etc.) in order to help eliminate damp or stale air. Cellars are more common in the United Kingdom in older houses, with most terraced housing built during late 19th and early 20th centuries having cellars. These were important shelters from air raids during World War II. In parts of North America that are prone to tornadoes (e.g. Tornado Alley), cellars still serve as shelter in the event of a direct hit on the house from a tornado or other storm damage caused by strong winds.

Except for Britain, Australia and New Zealand, cellars are popular in most western countries. In the United Kingdom, almost all new homes built since the 1960s have no cellar or basement due to the extra cost of digging down further into the sub-soil and a requirement for much deeper foundations and waterproof tanking. The reverse has recently become common, where the impact of smaller home-footprints has led to roof-space being utilised for further living space and now many new homes are built with third-floor living accommodation. For this reason, especially where lofts have been converted into living space, people tend to use garages for the storage of food freezers, tools, bicycles, garden and outdoor equipment. The majority of continental European houses have cellars, although a large proportion of people live in apartments or flats rather than houses. In North America, cellars usually are found in rural or older homes on the coasts and in the South. However, full basements are commonplace in new houses in the Canadian and American Midwest and other areas subject to tornado activity or requiring foundations below the frost line.

===Underground crawl space===


An underground crawl space (as the name implies) is a type of basement in which one cannot stand up—the height may be as little as one foot (30 cm), and the surface is often soil. Crawl spaces offer a convenient access to pipes, substructures and a variety of other areas that may be difficult or expensive to access otherwise. While a crawl space cannot be used as living space, it can be used as storage, often for infrequently used items. Care must be taken in doing so, however, as water from the damp ground, water vapour (entering from crawl space vents), and moisture seeping through porous concrete can create a perfect environment for mold/mildew to form on any surface in the crawl space, especially cardboard boxes, wood floors and surfaces, drywall and some types of insulation.

Health and safety issues must be considered when installing a crawl space. As air warms in a home, it rises and leaves through the upper regions of the house, much in the same way that air moves through a chimney. This phenomenon, called the &quot;stack effect&quot;, causes the home to suck air up from the crawl space into the main area of the home. Mould spores, decomposition odours, and material from dust mites in the crawl space can come up with the air, aggravating asthma and other breathing problems, and creating a variety of health concerns.

It is usually desirable to finish a crawl space with a plastic vapour barrier that will not support mold growth or allow humidity from the earth into the crawl space. This helps insulate the crawl space and discourages the habitation of insects and vermin by breaking the ecological chain in which insects feed off the mould and vermin feed on the insects, as well as creating a physical inorganic barrier that deters entrance into the space. Vapour barriers can end at the wall or be run up the wall and fastened to provide even more protection against moisture infiltration. Some pest control agencies recommend against covering the walls, as it complicates their job of inspection and spraying. Almost unheard of as late as the 1990s, vapour barriers are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. In fact, the more general area of conditioned vs. unconditioned crawl spaces has seen much research over the last decade.

Dry rot and other conditions detrimental to buildings (particularly wood and timber structures) can develop in enclosed spaces. Providing adequate ventilation is thought to reduce the occurrence of these problems. Crawl space vents are openings in the wall which allow air movement. Such vents are usually fitted with metal grating, mesh, or louvers which can block the movement of rodents and vermin but generally not insects such as termites and carpenter ants. One common rule is to provide vents in cross sectional area equal to 1/150 of the floor area served.

Modern crawl space thinking has reconsidered the usage of crawl space vents in the home. While crawl space vents do allow outside air to ventilate into the home, the ability of that air to dry out the crawl space is debatable. In areas with humid summers, during the summer months, the air vented into a crawl space will be humid, and as it enters the crawl space, which has been cooled naturally by the earth, the relative humidity of the air will rise. In those cases, crawl space vents can even increase the humidity level of a crawl space and lead to condensation on cool surfaces within, such as metal and wood. In the winter, crawl space vents should be shut off entirely, to keep out the cold winter air which can cool hot water pipes, furnaces, and water heaters stored within. During rainy weather, crawl space vents bring wet air into the crawl space, which will not dry the space effectively.

==Design and structural considerations==

Structurally, for houses, the basement walls typically form the foundation. In warmer climates, some houses do not have basements because they are not necessary (although many still prefer them). In colder climates, the foundation must be below the frost line. Unless constructed in very cold climates, the frost line is not so deep as to justify an entire level below the ground, although it is usually deep enough that a basement is the assumed standard. In places with oddly stratified soil substrata or high water tables, such as most of Florida, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and areas within of the Gulf of Mexico, basements are usually not financially feasible unless the building is a large apartment or commercial structure.

Excavation using a backhoe or excavator is commonly used to dig a basement. If shelf rock is discovered, the need for blasting may be cost prohibitive. Basement walls may need to have the surrounding earth backfilled around them to return the soil to grade. A water stop, some gravel and a french drain may need to be used to prevent water from entering the basement at the bottom of the wall. Walls below grade may need to be sealed with an impervious coating (such as tar) to prevent water seepage. A polyethylene of about 6 mil (visqueen) serves as a water barrier underneath the basement.

Some designs elect to simply leave a crawl space under the house, rather than a full basement due to structural challenges. Most other designs justify further excavations to create a full-height basement, sufficient for another level of living space. Even so, basements in Canada and the northern United States were typically only in height, rather than the standard full of the main floors. Older homes may have even lower basement heights as the basement walls were concrete block and thus, could be customized to any height. Modern builders offer higher basements as an option. The cost of the additional depth of excavation is usually quite expensive. Thus, houses almost certainly never have multi-storey basements though basements heights are a frequent choice among new home buyers. For large office or apartment buildings in prime locations, the cost of land may justify multi-storey basement parking garages.

The concrete floor in most basements is structurally not part of the foundation; only the basement walls are. If there are posts supporting a main floor beam to form a post and beam system, these posts typically go right through the basement floor to a footing underneath the basement floor. It is the footing that supports the post and the footing is part of the house foundation. Load-bearing wood-stud walls rest directly on the concrete floor. Under the concrete floor is typically gravel or crushed stone to facilitate draining. The floor is typically four inches (100 mm) thick and it rests on top of the foundation footings. The floor is typically sloped towards a drain point, in case of leaks.

Modern construction for basement walls typically falls into one of two categories: they will be made of poured-in-place concrete using concrete forms with a concrete pump, or they will use concrete masonry units (block walls). Rock may also be used, but is less common. In monolithic architecture, large parts of the building are made of concrete; in insulating concrete form construction, the concrete walls may be hidden with an exterior finish or siding. Inside the structure, a single Lally column, steel basement jack, wooden column or support post may hold up the floor above in a small basement. A series of these supports may be necessary for large basements; many basements have the support columns exposed.

Since warm air rises, basements are typically cooler than the rest of the house. In summer, this makes basements damp, due to the higher relative humidity. Dehumidifiers are recommended. In winter, additional heating, such as a fireplace or baseboard heaters may be required. A well-defined central heating system may minimize this requirement. Heating ducts typically run in the ceiling of the basement (since there is not an empty floor below to run the ducts). Ducts extending from the ceiling down to the floor help heat the cold floors of the basement. Older or cheaper systems may simply have the heating vent in the ceiling of the basement.

The finished floor is typically raised off the concrete basement floor. In countries such as Canada, laminate flooring is an exception: It is typically separated from the concrete by only a thin foam underlay. Radiant heating systems may be embedded within the concrete floor. Even if unfinished and unoccupied, basements are heated in order to ensure relative warmth of the floor above, and to prevent water supply pipes, drains, etc. from freezing and bursting in winter. It is recommended that the basement walls be insulated to the frost line. In Canada, the walls of a finished basement are typically insulated to the floor with vapor barriers to prevent moisture transmission. However, a finished basement should avoid wood or wood-laminate flooring, and metal framing and other moisture resistant products should be used. Finished basements can be costly to maintain due to deterioration of waterproofing materials or lateral earth movement etc. Below-ground structures will never be as dry as one above ground, and measures must be taken to circulate air and dehumidify the area.

==Drainage considerations==
Basement floor drains that connect to sanitary sewers need to be filled regularly to prevent the trap from drying out and sewer gas from escaping into the basement. The drain trap can be topped up automatically by the condensation from air conditioners or high-efficiency furnaces. A small tube from another downpipe is sometimes used to keep the trap from drying out. Health Canada advocates the use of special radon gas traps for floor drains that lead to soil or to a sealed sump pump. In areas where storm and sanitary sewers are combined, and there is the risk of flooding and sewage backing up, backwater valves in all basement drains may be mandated by code and definitely are recommended even if not mandated.

The main water cut-off valve is usually in the basement. Basements often have &quot;clean outs&quot; for the sanitary and storm sewers, where these pipes can be accessed. The storm sewer access is only needed where the weeping tiles drain into the storm sewers.

Other than with walk-out or look-out basements, windows in basements require a well and are below grade. A clear window well cover may be required to keep the window wells from accumulating rain water. There should be drains in the window well, connected to the foundation drains.

If the water table outside the basement is above the height of the basement floor, then the foundation drains or the weeping tiles outside the footings may be insufficient to keep the basement dry. A sump pump may be required. It can be located anywhere and is simply in a well that is deeper than the basement floor.

Even with functioning sump pumps or low water tables, basements may become wet after rainfall, due to improper drainage. The ground next to the basement must be graded such that water flows away from the basement wall. Downspouts from roof gutters should drain freely into the storm sewer or directed away from the house. Downspouts should not be connected to the foundation draintiles. If the draintiles become clogged by leaves or debris from the rain gutters, the roof water would cause basement flooding through the draintile. Damp-proofing or waterproofing materials are typically applied to outside of the basement wall. It is virtually impossible to make a concrete wall waterproof, over the long run, so drainage is the key. There are draining membranes that can be applied to the outside of the basement that create channels for water against the basement wall to flow to the foundation drains.

Where drainage is inadequate, waterproofing may be needed. There are numerous ways to waterproof a basement, but most systems fall into one of three categories:

*Tanking – Systems that bond to the basement structure and physically hold back groundwater.
*Cavity drainage – Dimpled plastic membranes are used to line the floors and walls of the basement, creating a &quot;drained cavity.&quot; Any water entering this drained cavity is diverted to a sump pump and pumped away from the basement.
*Exterior foundation drain – Installing an exterior foundation drain that will drain away by gravity is the most effective means to waterproof a basement. An exterior system allows water to flow away from the basement without using pumps or electricity. An exterior drain also allows for the installation of a waterproof membrane to the foundation walls.

The waterproofing system can be applied to the inside or the outside walls of a basement. When waterproofing existing basements it is much cheaper to waterproof the basement on the inside. Waterproofing on the outside requires the expense of excavation, but does offer a number of advantages for a homeowner over the long term. Among them are:

* Gravity system
* No pumps or electrical wiring required
* Membrane applied to exterior walls to prevent dampness, mold, moisture, and soil gases from entering the home
* Permanent solution

==Basement culture and finishings==
===Unfinished basement===
The unfinished design, found principally in spaces larger than the traditional cellar, is common in residences throughout the U.S. and Canada. One usually finds within it a water heater, various pipes running along the ceiling and downwards to the floor, and sometimes a workbench, a freezer or refrigerator, or a laundry set (usually found in older homes). Boxes of various materials, and objects unneeded in the rest of the house, are also often stored there; in this regard, the unfinished basement takes the place both of the cellar and of the attic. Home workshops are often located in the basement, since sawdust, metal chips, and other mess or noise are less of a nuisance there. Sometimes, if the laundry is found in the basement, a laundry chute collects dirty laundry from the upper floors of the house. The basement can contain all of these objects and still be considered to be &quot;unfinished&quot;, as they are either mostly or entirely functional in purpose.

===Finished basement===
In this case the space has been designed, either during construction or at a later point by the owners, to function as a fully habitable addition to the house. Frequently most or all of the basement is used as a recreation room or living room, but it is not uncommon as well to find there (either instead of or alongside the living/recreation room) a guest bedroom or teenager&#x27;s room, a bathroom, a home office, a home gym, a home theater, a basement bar, a sauna, craft room, play room, kitchenette, and one or more closets. Usually a part of the basement is unfurnished and is used for storage, a workshop, and/or a laundry room; when this is the case the water heater and furnace will also often be located there, although in some cases the entire basement is finished, and the water heater and furnace are boxed off into a closet.

===Partially finished basement===
The main point of distinction between this type of basement and the two others lies in its being either entirely unmodified (unlike the finished basement) beyond the addition of furniture, recreational objects and appliances, and/or exercise equipment on the bare floor, or slightly modified through the installation (besides any or all of the aforementioned items) of loose carpet and perhaps simple light fixtures. In both cases, the objects found there—many of which could be found in a finished basement as well—might include the following: weight sets and other exercise equipment; the boom boxes or entertainment systems used during exercise; musical instruments (which are not in storage, as they would technically be in an unfinished basement; an assembled drum set would be the most easily identified of these); football tables, chairs, couches and entertainment appliances of lesser quality than those in the rest of the house; refrigerators, stand-alone freezers, and microwaves (the first and the second being also sometimes used as supplementary storage units in an unfinished basement); and sports pennants and/or other types of posters which are attached to the walls.

As the description suggests, this type of basement, which also might be called &quot;half-finished&quot;, is likely used by teenagers and children. The entire family might utilize a work-out area. It is also common to have a secondary (or primary) home office in a partially finished basement, as well as a workbench and/or a space for laundry appliances.

Toilets and showers sometimes exist in this variety of basement, as many North American basements are designed to allow for their installation.

===Fully finished basement – retro fit===
In London the construction of finished retrofit basements is big business with a large number of projects in the 100–200 square meter bracket. There are a smaller number of projects in the 200–500 square meter bracket under construction. It is also not unusual to see multi-level retrofit basements. These are considerable works of civil engineering and require some skill and intuitive understanding as well as good engineering. Some of the more grandiose of these basement projects have been widely reported in the national media, including the &quot;Witanhurst&quot; project in the Highgate area of London. and the huge iceberg-like homes which are beginning to be constructed in prime London areas such as Kensington and Chelsea.

===Use in hospitals===
Hospitals often place their nuclear chemistry and radiation therapy and diagnostic resources in basements to utilize the shielding from the earth.

==Real estate floorspace measures==
In Canada, historically the basement area was excluded from advertised square footage of a house as it was not part of the living space. For example, a &quot;2,000-square-foot bungalow&quot; would, in reality, have of floor space. More recently, finished space has become increasingly acceptable as a measure which includes the developed basement areas of a home. Due to fire code requirements, most jurisdictions require an emergency egress (through either egress-style windows, or, in the case of a walk-out basement, a door) to include the basement square footage as living space.

<text>Richard Gautier (Go-tee-AY) (October 30, 1931 – January 13, 2017) was an American actor. He was known for his television roles as Hymie the Robot in the television series &quot;Get Smart&quot;, and Robin Hood in the TV comedy series &quot;When Things Were Rotten,&quot; as well as for originating the role of Conrad Birdie in the Broadway musical &quot;Bye Bye Birdie.&quot;

==Career==
Gautier started his career as a singer and a nightclub comic at the hungry i in San Francisco. He joined ASCAP in 1959 after serving in the United States Navy. In 1960, he portrayed fictional rock &#x27;n roll star Conrad Birdie in the original Broadway theatre production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, receiving a Tony Award nomination for his performance. He would later appear with two of his &quot;Birdie&quot; stars in two films: with Kay Medford in &quot;Ensign Pulver&quot; in 1964, and with Dick Van Dyke in &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; in 1967.
===Game show panelist===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Gautier was a frequent game show panelist. He appeared on &quot;Match Game&quot;; &quot;Family Feud&quot;; &quot;Tattletales&quot;; &quot;Showoffs&quot;; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot;; &quot;Liar&#x27;s Club&quot;; &quot;Password Plus&quot;; &quot;Body Language&quot;; &quot;Super Password&quot;; &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;; and the TV version of &quot;Can You Top This?&quot;

===Batman===
In 1973, when Burt Ward and Yvonne Craig reprised their Batman roles (as Robin and Batgirl, respectively) for a TV public service announcement about equal pay for women, Adam West, who was trying to distance himself from the Batman role at the time, declined to participate. Gautier filled in for West as Batman on this occasion.

===Voice-over roles===
Gautier performed several voice-over roles in animation, including Rodimus Prime in the third season of &quot;The Transformers&quot; animated series from 1986 to 1987, as well as Serpentor in the &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; series, Louis from the 1986 cartoon &quot;Foofur&quot;, Spike the Dog in &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot;, some additional voices in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The New Yogi Bear Show&quot;, Wooly Smurf in &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, and several voices for &quot;Inhumanoids&quot;, including Crygen and Pyre and their combined form, Magnakor.

===Celebrity caricatures===
Gautier was known for his caricatures of celebrities and wrote several instructional books on caricature, drawing, and cartooning.

==Personal life==
Richard Gilbert Gautier was born in Culver City, California, on October 30, 1931. His father was a grip and his mother was a costume seamstress.

Gautier was first married to Beverly J. Gerber; the marriage ended in divorce after they had three children together. His second wife was actress Barbara Stuart, and his final marriage was to Tess Hightower, a psychologist. 

His son Randy, nicknamed Rand, had both a brief stint in pornography under the name Austin Moore, and would in 1995 steal a videotape from the home of Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson, containing footage they had filmed of themselves having sex while on vacation. Rand, along with a distributor, released it on the Internet, and it became one of the first widespread celebrity sex tapes.

Gautier died from pneumonia on January 13, 2017, at an assisted living facility in Arcadia, California, following a long illness.

<text>Regional elections were held in Belgium, to choose representatives in the regional councils of Flanders, Wallonia, Brussels and the German-speaking Community on 13 June 1999. The regional elections were held on the same day as the European elections and the federal elections.

==Flemish Parliament==
The incumbent Flemish Government consisted of the Christian People&#x27;s Party (CVP) and the Socialist Party (SP), led by Minister-President Luc Van den Brande (CVP). Following this election, a government was formed without the Christian democrats. New Minister-President (Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD)) led a &quot;purple-green-yellow&quot; coalition of his own liberal VLD, the Socialist Party, Agalev and the nationalist People&#x27;s Union (VU-ID). This change mirrored what happened on the federal level, where the Government was succeeded by the Guy Verhofstadt Government.

Also notable was the continuation of the rise of , especially in the constituency of Antwerp where Filip Dewinter was candidate and where the party received 25% of the votes, or as much as 30% in the city of Antwerp itself.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===By constituency===

These were only the second direct election for the Flemish Parliament, but the last to use arrondissement-based constituencies. They were merged into provincial constituencies starting from the 2004 election.

<doc id="568967" wikidata="Q1141183" url="?curid=568967" title="Backward chaining">
<text>Backward chaining (or backward reasoning) is an inference method described colloquially as working backward from the goal. It is used in automated theorem provers, inference engines, proof assistants, and other artificial intelligence applications.

In game theory, researchers apply it to (simpler) subgames to find a solution to the game, in a process called &quot;backward induction&quot;. In chess, it is called retrograde analysis, and it is used to generate table bases for chess endgames for computer chess.

Backward chaining is implemented in logic programming by SLD resolution. Both rules are based on the modus ponens inference rule. It is one of the two most commonly used methods of reasoning with inference rules and logical implications – the other is forward chaining. Backward chaining systems usually employ a depth-first search strategy, e.g. Prolog.

== Usage ==

Backward chaining starts with a list of goals (or a hypothesis) and works backwards from the consequent to the antecedent to see if any data supports any of these consequents. An inference engine using backward chaining would search the inference rules until it finds one with a consequent (Then clause) that matches a desired goal. If the antecedent (If clause) of that rule is not known to be true, then it is added to the list of goals (for one&#x27;s goal to be confirmed one must also provide data that confirms this new rule).

For example, suppose a new pet, Fritz, is delivered in an opaque box along with two facts about Fritz:
* Fritz croaks
* Fritz eats flies
The goal is to decide whether Fritz is green, based on a rule base containing the following four rules:

# If X croaks and X eats flies – Then X is a frog
# If X chirps and X sings – Then X is a canary
# If X is a frog – Then X is green
# If X is a canary – Then X is yellow

With backward reasoning, an inference engine can determine whether Fritz is green in four steps. To start, the query is phrased as a goal assertion that is to be proven: &quot;Fritz is green&quot;.

1. Fritz is substituted for X in rule #3 to see if its consequent matches the goal, so rule #3 becomes:
 If Fritz is a frog – Then Fritz is green
Since the consequent matches the goal (&quot;Fritz is green&quot;), the rules engine now needs to see if the antecedent (&quot;Fritz is a frog&quot;) can be proven. The antecedent, therefore, becomes the new goal:
 Fritz is a frog

2. Again substituting Fritz for X, rule #1 becomes:
 If Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies – Then Fritz is a frog
Since the consequent matches the current goal (&quot;Fritz is a frog&quot;), the inference engine now needs to see if the antecedent (&quot;Fritz croaks and eats flies&quot;) can be proven. The antecedent, therefore, becomes the new goal:
 Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies

3. Since this goal is a conjunction of two statements, the inference engine breaks it into two sub-goals, both of which must be proven:
 Fritz croaks
 Fritz eats flies

4. To prove both of these sub-goals, the inference engine sees that both of these sub-goals were given as initial facts. Therefore, the conjunction is true:
 Fritz croaks and Fritz eats flies
therefore the antecedent of rule #1 is true and the consequent must be true:
 Fritz is a frog
therefore the antecedent of rule #3 is true and the consequent must be true:
 Fritz is green

This derivation, therefore, allows the inference engine to prove that Fritz is green. Rules #2 and #4 were not used.

Note that the goals always match the affirmed versions of the consequents of implications (and not the negated versions as in modus tollens) and even then, their antecedents are then considered as the new goals (and not the conclusions as in affirming the consequent), which ultimately must match known facts (usually defined as consequents whose antecedents are always true); thus, the inference rule used is modus ponens.

Because the list of goals determines which rules are selected and used, this method is called goal-driven, in contrast to data-driven forward-chaining inference. The backward chaining approach is often employed by expert systems.

Programming languages such as Prolog, Knowledge Machine and ECLiPSe support backward chaining within their inference engines.

<text>A geocentric orbit, Earth-centered orbit, or Earth orbit involves any object orbiting Earth, such as the Moon or artificial satellites. In 1997, NASA estimated there were approximately 2,465 artificial satellite payloads orbiting Earth and 6,216 pieces of space debris as tracked by the Goddard Space Flight Center. More than 16,291 objects previously launched have undergone orbital decay and entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. 

A spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a low Earth orbit, this velocity is about ; by contrast, the fastest crewed airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was in 1967 by the North American X-15. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of is about 36 MJ/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.

Spacecraft with a perigee below about are subject to drag from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite&#x27;s cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about , decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to , it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere. The escape velocity required to pull free of Earth&#x27;s gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about .

==List of terms and concepts==
;Altitude: as used here, the height of an object above the average surface of the Earth&#x27;s oceans (mean sea level).
;Analemma: a term in astronomy used to describe the plot of the positions of the Sun on the celestial sphere throughout one year. Closely resembles a figure-eight.
;Apogee: is the farthest point that a satellite or celestial body can go from Earth, at which the orbital velocity will be at its minimum.
;Eccentricity: a measure of how much an orbit deviates from a perfect circle. Eccentricity is strictly defined for all circular and elliptical orbits, and parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories.
;Equatorial plane: as used here, an imaginary plane extending from the equator on the Earth to the celestial sphere.
;Escape velocity: as used here, the minimum velocity an object without propulsion needs to have to move away indefinitely from the Earth. An object at this velocity will enter a parabolic trajectory; above this velocity it will enter a hyperbolic trajectory.
;Impulse: the integral of a force over the time during which it acts. Measured in (N·sec or lb * sec).
;Inclination: the angle between a reference plane and another plane or axis. In the sense discussed here the reference plane is the Earth&#x27;s equatorial plane.
;Orbital arc: an imaginary arc in the sky as seen from any given location on the surface of the Earth.
;Orbital characteristics: the six parameters of the Keplerian elements needed to specify that orbit uniquely.
;Orbital period: as defined here, time it takes a satellite to make one full orbit around the Earth.
;Perigee: is the nearest approach point of a satellite or celestial body from Earth, at which the orbital velocity will be at its maximum.
;Sidereal day: the time it takes for a celestial object to rotate 360°. For the Earth this is: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.091 seconds.
;Solar time: as used here, the local time as measured by a sundial.
;Velocity: an object&#x27;s speed in a particular direction. Since velocity is defined as a vector, both speed and direction are required to define it.

==Types==
The following is a list of different geocentric orbit classifications.

===Altitude classifications===
; Transatmospheric orbit (TAO): Geocentric orbits with altitudes at apogee higher than and perigee that intersects with the defined atmosphere.
; Low Earth orbit (LEO) : Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from to above mean sea level. At 160 km, one revolution takes approximately 90 minutes, and the circular orbital speed is .
; Medium Earth orbit (MEO) : Geocentric orbits with altitudes at apogee ranging between and that of the geosynchronous orbit at .
; Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) : Geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of . The period of the orbit equals one sidereal day, coinciding with the rotation period of the Earth. The speed is approximately .
; High Earth orbit (HEO) : Geocentric orbits with altitudes at apogee higher than that of the geosynchronous orbit. A special case of high Earth orbit is the highly elliptical orbit, where altitude at perigee is less than .

===Inclination classifications===
; Inclined orbit : An orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not 0.
:; Polar orbit : A satellite that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore it has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees.
:; Polar Sun synchronous orbit : A nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local time on every pass. Useful for image-taking satellites because shadows will be the same on every pass.

===Eccentricity classifications===
; Circular orbit : An orbit that has an eccentricity of 0 and whose path traces a circle.
; Elliptic orbit : An orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an ellipse.
:; Hohmann transfer orbit : An orbital maneuver that moves a spacecraft from one circular orbit to another using two engine impulses. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann.
:; Geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) : A geocentric-elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a low Earth Orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit.
:; Highly elliptical orbit (HEO) : Geocentric orbit with apogee above 35,786 km and low perigee (about 1,000 km) that result in long dwell times near apogee.
::; Molniya orbit : A highly elliptical orbit with inclination of 63.4° and orbital period of ½ of a sidereal day (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the Earth.
::; Tundra orbit : A highly elliptical orbit with inclination of 63.4° and orbital period of one sidereal day (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a designated area of the Earth.
; Hyperbolic trajectory : An &quot;orbit&quot; with eccentricity greater than 1. The object&#x27;s velocity reaches some value in excess of the escape velocity, therefore it will escape the gravitational pull of the Earth and continue to travel infinitely with a velocity (relative to Earth) decelerating to some finite value, known as the hyperbolic excess velocity.
:; Escape Trajectory : This trajectory must be used to launch an interplanetary probe away from Earth, because the excess over escape velocity is what changes its heliocentric orbit from that of Earth.
:; Capture Trajectory : This is the mirror image of the escape trajectory; an object traveling with sufficient speed, not aimed directly at Earth, will move toward it and accelerate. In the absence of a decelerating engine impulse to put it into orbit, it will follow the escape trajectory after periapsis.
; Parabolic trajectory : An &quot;orbit&quot; with eccentricity exactly equal to 1. The object&#x27;s velocity equals the escape velocity, therefore it will escape the gravitational pull of the Earth and continue to travel with a velocity (relative to Earth) decelerating to 0. A spacecraft launched from Earth with this velocity would travel some distance away from it, but follow it around the Sun in the same heliocentric orbit. It is possible, but not likely that an object approaching Earth could follow a parabolic capture trajectory, but speed and direction would have to be precise.

===Directional classifications===
; Prograde orbit : an orbit in which the projection of the object onto the equatorial plane revolves about the Earth in the same direction as the rotation of the Earth.
; Retrograde orbit : an orbit in which the projection of the object onto the equatorial plane revolves about the Earth in the direction opposite that of the rotation of the Earth.

===Geosynchronous classifications===
; Semi-synchronous orbit (SSO) : An orbit with an altitude of approximately and an orbital period of approximately 12 hours
; Geosynchronous orbit (GEO) : Orbits with an altitude of approximately . Such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.
:; Geostationary orbit (GSO) : A geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.
:; Clarke orbit : Another name for a geostationary orbit. Named after the writer Arthur C. Clarke.
::; Earth orbital libration points : The libration points for objects orbiting Earth are at 105 degrees west and 75 degrees east. More than 160 satellites are gathered at these two points.
:; Supersynchronous orbit : A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west.
:; Subsynchronous orbit : A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.
:; Graveyard orbit, disposal orbit, junk orbit : An orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.

===Special classifications===
; Sun-synchronous orbit : An orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planet&#x27;s surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites.
; Moon orbit : The orbital characteristics of Earth&#x27;s Moon. Average altitude of , elliptical–inclined orbit.

===Non-geocentric classifications===
; Horseshoe orbit : An orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a planet but is actually in co-orbit with it. See asteroids 3753 (Cruithne) and 2002 AA29.
; Sub-orbital flight : A launch where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it.

<doc id="568973" wikidata="Q2354691" url="?curid=568973" title="Bernie Kopell">
<text>Bernard Morton Kopell (born June 21, 1933) is an American character actor known for his roles as Siegfried in &quot;Get Smart&quot; from 1966 to 1969 and as Dr. Adam Bricker (&quot;Doc&quot;) on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; from 1977 to 1986.

==Early life==
Kopell was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jewish parents Pauline (née Taran) and Al Bernard Kopell Kopell attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn before enrolling at New York University, majoring in dramatic arts and graduating with a bachelor of fine arts in 1955.

While fulfilling his military service, he served as a librarian at Naval Air Station, Norfolk, Virginia, and then between 1956 and 1957 on board the battleship .

During his time on the USS &quot;Iowa&quot;, he travelled extensively to Europe in Italy, Spain, Greece, the Middle East in Turkey as well as to South America. He also taught the GED prep course to other military personnel. After completing active duty, Kopell returned to New York before going to Los Angeles with the promise of an agent by fellow graduate James Drury.

==Career==
In Los Angeles, Kopell initially drove a taxi and tried to sell Kirby vacuum cleaners to make ends meet before being cast in a minor role in &quot;The Brighter Day&quot;, a daytime soap aired on CBS. From there, he moved on to star in &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot; and &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; impersonating Latino characters, eventually managing to branch out and do other accents.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, Kopell appeared in many television series, often sitcoms, including &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot;, &quot;Green Acres, Ben Casey,&quot; &quot;The Flying Nun&quot;, &quot;Needles and Pins&quot;, &quot;Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Sonny and Cher Show&quot;, &quot;Lancelot Link-Secret Chimp&quot;, &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, and &quot;Kojak&quot;.

However, Kopell&#x27;s longest-running role was as Dr. Adam Bricker on &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, an Aaron Spelling production. He remained on the series during its entire run, appearing in 250 episodes.

===Siegfried and other roles===
Kopell made memorable recurring appearances as KAOS agent Siegfried in &quot;Get Smart&quot;, Alan-a-Dale in &quot;When Things Were Rotten&quot;, Jerry Bauman in &quot;That Girl&quot; and Louie Pallucci in &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot;. He played several characters on &quot;Bewitched&quot;, including the witches&#x27; apothecary and the hippie warlock Alonzo in the episode &quot;The Warlock in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot;. He played Charlie Miller as a member of the cast of the situation comedy &quot;Needles and Pins&quot;, which ran for 14 episodes in the autumn of 1973. He portrayed a plastic surgeon who gave Ed Brown a facelift on &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;. Earlier in his career, he played a director in an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;Good-Bye George&quot;). About this same time, he guest starred on the short-lived &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

===Doc on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and other roles===
Kopell&#x27;s role as Doc on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; was parodied in a humorous appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in 1995. Two entries in that night&#x27;s Top Ten List poked fun at &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and at the Doc character specifically. The camera cut to Kopell, who was sitting in the audience, and he stormed out of the theater. A few moments later, he was shown having been re-seated in the mezzanine when the second parody was made at his expense, and again stood up, raised his fists and stormed out, playing along with the host. In a dream sequence of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, Kopell made a parody cameo as an actor who played a ship&#x27;s doctor so many times he offers to perform an operation for real, while in a 1994 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; he appeared as Doc during a &quot;Love Boat&quot;-themed spoof of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. In the 1990s, Kopell traded on his Doc Bricker persona when he appeared in a commercial for an anti-snoring product named D-Snore, in which he noted that loud snoring &quot;can even ruin a romantic cruise.&quot;

After &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, Kopell was so recognizable that he was not in roles often without a nod to his most famous role. He appears as a coroner in &quot;Which Prue Is It Anyway&quot;, an episode of &quot;Charmed&quot;. Kopell appears in the &quot;Monk&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Monk and the Critic&quot;, playing Mr. Gilson, the ill-fated restroom attendant, whom Monk referred to as the Michelangelo of lavatories. He guest starred in &quot;Pinky&quot;, a 2009 episode of &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;. He made a cameo as a patient in the &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Friend the Doctor&quot;, as well as an episode of &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;.

Beginning in August 2022, Kopell co-starred with Hal Linden in &quot;Two Jews Talking&quot; off-Broadway at the Theater at St Clement&#x27;s. He played his final performance on October 16.

As of 2023, he still appears regularly in film and television productions despite his advanced age.

==Personal life==
Kopell has been married three times, first to actress Celia Whitney, then actress Yolanda Veloz, before marrying Catrina Honadle in 1997. Kopell and Honadle have two children together, Adam (born 1998) and Josh (born 2003).

<doc id="568978" wikidata="Q279494" url="?curid=568978" title="Coccoloba uvifera">
<text>Coccoloba uvifera is a species of tree and flowering plant in the buckwheat family, Polygonaceae, that is native to coastal beaches throughout tropical America and the Caribbean, including central &amp; southern Florida, the Bahamas, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, and Bermuda. Common names include seagrape and baygrape.

==Fruit==
In late summer, it bears green fruit, about diameter, in large, grape-like clusters. The fruit gradually ripens to a purplish color. Each contains a large pit that constitutes most of the volume of the fruit.

==Cultivation and propagation==
Although it is capable of surviving down to about 2 °C (35.6 °F), the tree cannot survive frost. The leaves turn reddish before withering. The seeds of this plant, once gathered, must be planted immediately, for unlike most plants, the seeds cannot withstand being stored for future planting.

&quot;C. uvifera&quot; is wind-resistant, moderately tolerant of shade, and highly tolerant of salt, so it is often planted to stabilize beach edges; it is also planted as an ornamental shrub. The fruit is very tasty, and can be used for jam or eaten directly from the tree. The shrub is low maintenance and largely disease and pest free. Sea grape does have one minor pest, the sea grape borer, which is a moth native to florida that bores into small twigs and branches and kills them along with their leaves. The damage, however, is usually minor. The leaves of the sea grape are also slow to decompose, which may cause some annoyance for homeowners.

Sea grape is a dioecious species, that is, male and female flowers are borne on separate plants, and cross-pollination is necessary for fruit to develop. Honey bees and other insects help pollinate these plants; male and female plants can be distinguished by the appearance of their flowers, as males usually show dead flower stalks.
* Hardiness: USDA zone 9B–11
* Propagation: seeds and cuttings
* Culture: partial shade/full sun, drought tolerance

==Uses==

&quot;Coccoloba uvifera&quot; is a popular ornamental plant in south Florida yards. It serves as a dune stabilizer and protective habitat for small animals. Tall sea grape plants behind beaches help prevent sea turtles from being distracted by lights from nearby buildings. The sap has been used for dyeing and tanning leather. The wood has occasionally been used in furniture, as firewood, or for making charcoal. The fruits of the sea grape may be eaten raw, cooked into jellies and jams, or fermented into sea grape wine. The leaves of the sea grape can be made into a tea and honey bees can make a certain type of honey with the nectar of the sea grape flowers.

In other places native to sea grapes, various parts of the plant are used for medicinal purposes. For example, in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean the roots and bark of the plants are used in traditional medicine, while in the Yucatán peninsula tea made from the bark of sea grape mixed with alcohol is used for ulcers. In French Guiana, a juice made from the whole plant called Jamaica kino, is used to treat diarrhea and dysentery.

==Classification==
The first botanical names of the plant were assigned in 1696 by Hans Sloane, who called it &quot;Prunus maritima racemosa&quot;, &quot;maritime grape-cluster Prunus&quot;, and Leonard Plukenet, who named it &quot;Uvifera littorea&quot;, &quot;grape-bearer of the shore&quot;, both of which names reflect the European concept of &quot;sea-grape&quot;, expressed in a number of languages by the explorers of the times. The natives viewed it as a large mulberry.

The first edition of Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753), based on Plukenet, assigned the plant to &quot;Polygonum uvifera&quot; and noted &quot;flores non vidi&quot;, &quot;I have not seen the flowers.&quot; Subsequently, Patrick Browne, &quot;The Civil and Natural History of Jamaica&quot; (1756) devised &quot;Coccoloba&quot; for it. Relying on Browne, Linnaeus&#x27; second edition (1762), changed the classification to &quot;Coccolobus uvifera&quot;, citing all the other names. &quot;Coccoloba&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;kokkolobis&quot;, a kind of grape, literally, &quot;berry pod&quot;.

<doc id="568980" wikidata="Q681067" url="?curid=568980" title="Lady of Elche">
<text>The Lady of Elche (, Valencian: ) is a limestone bust that was discovered in 1897, at &quot;La Alcudia&quot;, an archaeological site on a private estate two kilometers south of Elche, Spain. It is now exhibited in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid.

It is generally known as an Iberian artifact from the 4th century BC, although the artisanship suggests strong Hellenistic influences. According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Religion&quot;, the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; is believed to have a direct association with Tanit, the goddess of Carthage, who was worshiped by the Punic-Iberians.

==Sculpture==
The bust, originally colored, represents a woman wearing an elaborate headdress and large wheel-like coils (known as ) on each side of the face. The opening in the rear of the sculpture indicates it may have been used as a funerary urn.

Other artifacts associated with Iberian culture are the &quot;Lady of Guardamar&quot;—which has similar wheel-like and necklaces—and the &quot;Lady of Baza&quot;. While the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; is a bust, there are indications that it was part of a seated statue, similar to the &quot;Lady of Baza&quot; (with which it shares similar necklace pendants) or a standing one like the &quot;Gran Dama Oferente&quot; from Cerro de los Santos (Montealegre del Castillo, Albacete).

These three figures and the &quot;Bicha of Balazote&quot; are exhibited in the same Iberian art hall in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid.

In 2023, two female stone busts were discovered at the Turuñuelo archeological site in Guareña, Spain, that are somewhat similar to the Lady of Elche, but are about a century earlier, dating to the 5th century BC. They were found in the context of the Tartessos culture. The busts feature details of jewelry and hairstyles, and are thought to be the first facial representations of Tartessian goddesses.

==Discovery and repatriation==

The sculpture was found on 4 August 1897, by a young worker, Manuel Campello Esclapez. The popular version of the story differs from the official report by Pere Ibarra (the local keeper of the records) which stated that Antonio Maciá found the bust. Ibarra&#x27;s version of the discovery story, was that farm workers clearing the southeast slope of La Alcudia for agricultural purposes, discovered the sculpture. The bust was quickly nicknamed &quot;Reina Mora&quot; or &quot;Moorish Queen&quot; by locals.

An archaeological site is now located where the bust of Elche was discovered. Evidence has been found there of an Iberian-Punic settlement, a Roman sewer, walls and Roman houses, and mosaics. One mosaic shows an effigy of Saint Abdon, belonging to a Christian basilica of the 5th century. The latter archaeological evidence is supported by the codices of the councils of Toledo where it discusses an audience with bishops from &quot;Illici&quot; (Elche).

Dr. Campello, owner of the farm, was married to Asunción Ibarra, daughter of Aureliano Ibarra Manzoni, a 19th century humanist and amateur archeologist. Ibarra Manzoni had found a number of objects and Iberian vestiges on his own farmland and in other places in the municipality of Elche. He built up a valuable collection, which he bequeathed to his daughter Asunción. He provided instructions that she make the necessary arrangements for the collection to be offered for sale to the Real Academia de la Historia after her death, to be located finally at the National Archaeological Museum. The will specified that the collection be sold in its entirety. The family placed the Lady on their balcony so that it could be viewed by all of the residents of Elche.

Don Pedro Ibarra invited French archaeologist Pierre Paris to his home to see the &quot;Mystery Play of Elche&quot;. When the archaeologist saw the Iberian bust, he recognized its worth and notified the Louvre in Paris. The Louvre offered a large sum of money for the time: 4,000 francs, and purchased the sculpture within a few weeks of its discovery. Despite opposition from Doña Asunción, the Iberian bust was sold. On 30 August 1897, the sculpture was sent to the Louvre.

For 40 years, the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; was exhibited at the Louvre. After the start of World War II in 1939, as a precaution, the sculpture was transferred for safe-keeping to the castle of Montauban near Toulouse. The Vichy government negotiated the statue&#x27;s return to Spain with Franco&#x27;s government. In 1941, it was returned through an exchange of works, which also included the &quot;Immaculate Conception of the Venerable Ones&quot; by Murillo, the twin sphinxes of El Salobral and several pieces of the Treasure of Guarrazar, and the Iberian sculptures of Osuna. In return, Spain transferred to France a portrait of Mariana of Austria by Velázquez (the Prado kept another existing version of the portrait, which was considered of superior quality) and a &quot;Portrait of Antonio de Covarrubias&quot; by El Greco. Since 1941, the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; has been officially owned by the Museo del Prado (catalog number E433).

The discovery of the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; initiated a popular interest in pre-Roman Iberian culture. She appeared on a 1948 Spanish one-peseta banknote and was mentioned in William Gaddis&#x27;s &quot;The Recognitions&quot; (1955).

In 1971, it was transferred from the Prado to the National Archaeological Museum of Spain, where it is currently exhibited.
===Exhibitions in Elche===

In 1965, the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; returned briefly to Elche, on the occasion of the seventh centenary of &quot;Mystery Play of Elche&quot;.

On 19 January 2006, the Minister of Culture of Spain, Carmen Calvo, issued a decision to temporarily lease the Lady to its hometown. From 18 May 2006 to 1 November 2006, the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; presided over the inauguration of the Museum of Archaeology and History of Elche (in the Palace of Altamira) and the exhibition &quot;From Ilici to Elx, 2500 Years of History&quot; that took place in different locations in the city. It was represented by an exact replica afterwards.

==Contentions of forgery==
The bust was first accused of being a forgery in 1906, in an essay called &quot;&quot; by archeologist José Ramón Mélida.

In 1995, art historian John F. Moffitt (1940–2008) published &quot;Art Forgery: The Case of the Lady of Elche&quot; (University Press of Florida) in which he contended that the statue was a forgery, citing its stylistic differences from ancient Iberian prototypes. Moffitt suggested that the sculpture could be the work of well-known forger Francisco Pallas y Puig (1859–1926), commissioned by the landowner, Manuel Campello Antón (1833–1904) to coincide with a visit from French archaeologist Pierre Paris, who purchased the sculpture for the Louvre. Moffitt discussed the sculpture in the context of a &quot;golden age&quot; of forgery in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, which followed a growing cultural interest in collecting art and artifacts.

Experts in Spanish archaeology have rejected Moffitt&#x27;s theory and accept the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; as a genuine ancient Iberian work. Antonio Uriarte of the University of Madrid has stated: &quot;Decade by decade, research has reinforced the coherence of the Lady within the corpus of Iberian sculpture. The Lady was found more than a century ago, and many of its features, not then understood, have been confirmed by subsequent finds. For example, the use of paint in Iberian sculpture was unknown when the Lady appeared.&quot; A Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) study on the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; micropigmentation published in 2005 concluded that the trace pigments on the statue were consistent with ancient materials and that no modern pigments had been found. 

Throughout the 20th century, other similar iberian busts were discovered in the southeast of Spain, such as the Lady of Baza, the Lady of Caudete, the Lady of Guardamar or the Lady of Cerro de los Santos.

In 2011, María Pilar de Luxán, the author of the 2005 study, analyzed microparticles within the back hole of the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot;, utilizing electron microscopy and X-ray dispersive spectrometry. Luxán deduced that the particles belonged to the ashes of human bones and that they compared with those of the Iberian period. She concluded that the statue was used as a funerary urn in the Iberian period, thus guaranteeing its antiquity and confirming the hypothesis about its function.

In 2017, Sonia Gutiérrez Llore, chair of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Alicante and director of the University&#x27;s Institute of Investigation in Archaeology and Historical Heritage-INAPH, wrote about the many discrepancies in the narrative surrounding the sculpture&#x27;s origin as it evolved into an idealized national symbol. &quot;A story has been built around the Lady that has avoided the obvious uncertainties, if not true contradictions,&quot; Gutiérrez Llore said, &quot;but that by dint of being transmitted to future generations has ended up becoming the dominant historical memory, considered truthful, traditional and unquestionable.&quot;

==In modern culture==
The &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; stands as a statue representing Phoenicia as one of the seafaring nations at the Alexander Hamilton Custom House facade.
French artist James Tissot based figures in several of his turn-of-the-century paintings on the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot;.

A large prominent sculpture &quot;La Dama Ibérica&quot; based on the &quot;Lady of Elche&quot; and created by the Spanish sculptor Manolo Valdés in 2007 overlooks a major intersection in the downtown region of Valencia, Spain.

<doc id="568981" wikidata="Q1332676" url="?curid=568981" title="William Schallert">
<text>William Joseph Schallert (July 6, 1922 – May 8, 2016) was an American character actor who appeared in dozens of television shows and films over a career spanning more than 60 years. He is known for his roles on &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot; (1957–1959), &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; (1955–1962), and &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; (1963–1966).

==Early life and career==
William Schallert was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Edwin Francis Schallert, a longtime drama critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and Elza Emily Schallert (née Baumgarten), a magazine writer and radio host. He began acting while a student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) but left to become an Army Air Corps fighter pilot in World War II. He returned to UCLA after the war and graduated in 1946. In 1946, he helped found the Circle Theatre with Sydney Chaplin and several fellow students. In 1948, Schallert was directed by Sydney&#x27;s father, Charlie Chaplin, in a staging of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Rain&quot;. In 1949, Schallert served as the reciter in a concert performance of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Napoleon&quot; in celebration of the composer&#x27;s 75th birthday.

Schallert appeared in supporting roles on numerous television programs starting in the early 1950s, including four episodes (and three different characters) in &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot; between 1958 and 1961. He was in three episodes of &quot;The Rifleman&quot; and five episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; : season 3, episode 16 &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; in 1957, season 4, episode 16 &quot;Gypsum Hills Feud&quot; in 1958, and as Col. Grant in season 7, episode 27 &quot;Wagon Girls&quot; in 1962, banker Ezra Thorpe in &quot;The Money Store&quot; season 14, episode 14 and Jake Spence in season 15 episode 20 &quot;Albert&quot;. Schallert portrayed farmer Sam Becker in a 1961 episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, whose newborn son is delivered by Andy. He was a Nazi doctor in a 1967 episode of &quot;The Rat Patrol&quot;. He appeared in &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; as a very humble folk-singing guitar player in &quot;Stage Fright&quot; in 1971. He appeared three times as Major Karl Richmond on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, starring Dean Fredericks in the title role.

Schallert also appeared in several films. He had roles in &quot;The Man from Planet X&quot; (1951) with Robert Clarke, &quot;The Tarnished Angels&quot; (1958) with Robert Stack, &quot;Blue Denim&quot; (1959) with Brandon deWilde, &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; (1959) with Doris Day and Rock Hudson, &quot;In The Heat Of The Night&quot; (1967) with Sidney Poitier, &quot;Speedway&quot; (1968) with Elvis Presley, &quot;The Jerk&quot; (1979) with Steve Martin, &quot;Teachers&quot; (1984) with Nick Nolte, and &quot;Innerspace&quot; (1987), in which he played Martin Short&#x27;s doctor. Schallert was a founding member of the Circle Players at The Circle Theatre, started in 1946, now known as El Centro Theatre.

Among eight appearances on the syndicated western anthology series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, Schallert in 1955 portrayed American Civil War General Jesse Lee Reno in the episode &quot;Reno.&quot; In the story line, two veterans of the Mexican War who served under Reno (played by Frank Griffin and Stanley Clements) honor him with the naming of the second-largest city in Nevada. He appeared as Sam Clemens in a 1962 episode, &quot;The $275,000 Sack of Flour.&quot; He appeared in an episode of the TV series In The Heat of The Night, where he portrays a husband who kills his terminally ill wife, as Carl Tibbets, owner of a book store in Sparta. Thus he appeared in both the 1967 film as the mayor and the 1992 episode of the TV show.

Schallert starred in &quot;Philbert&quot;, an innovative 1964 television pilot for ABC, which combined live-action camera work and animation. It was created by Warner Bros. animator Friz Freleng and directed by Richard Donner. ABC backed out of the series shortly before full production was to begin, although the completed pilot was released in theaters by Warner Brothers as a short subject.

Schallert was probably best known as Martin Lane on &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;. He also appeared as a wise teacher, Mr. Leander Pomfritt, on &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; and as &quot;The Admiral&quot; on &quot;Get Smart&quot;. On the two former shows he worked opposite actress Jean Byron. Schallert made three guest appearances on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot; between 1957 and 1962, including the role of Donald Graves in the series&#x27; fifth episode &quot;The Case of the Sulky Girl,&quot; as Dr. Bradbury in the 1961 episode &quot;The Case of the Misguided Missile,&quot; and as Len Dykes in the 1962 episode &quot;The Case of the Melancholy Marksman.&quot; He played the role of Nilz Baris in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot;; and much later he portrayed Varani, a Bajoran musician, in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Sanctuary.&quot;

Schallert played the role of Carson Drew in the television series &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; (1977–1979), featuring Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew. In addition to his onscreen performances, Schallert did voice-over work for numerous television and radio commercials over the years. Among these was a recurring role as &quot;Milton the Toaster&quot; in animated commercials for Kellogg&#x27;s Pop-Tarts. He had the distinction of appearing in both the original film version of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967) and the later NBC TV version in 1992. He later voiced Velma&#x27;s high school teacher Professor Pomfrit and recurring character Mr. B&#x27;s neighbour Farmer P., who was popcorn creator Neville Poppenbacher in 2 episodes of What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?. In 2004, &quot;TV Guide&quot; recognized Schallert&#x27;s portrayal of Martin Lane on &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; as No. 39 on its list of &quot;50 Greatest TV Dads.&quot;

==Later career/SAG president==

Schallert served as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) from 1979 to 1981, and afterwards remained active in SAG projects, including serving as a trustee of the SAG Pension and Health Plans since 1983, and of the Motion Picture and Television Fund since 1977. (His former co-star and television daughter, Patty Duke, also served as SAG president from 1985 to 1988.) During Schallert&#x27;s tenure as SAG president, he founded the Committee for Performers with Disabilities, and in 1993 he was awarded the Ralph Morgan Award for service to the Guild.

Schallert continued to work steadily as an actor in later life, appearing in a 2007 episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, the HBO television film &quot;Recount&quot; (2008) as U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice John Paul Stevens, and the HBO series &quot;True Blood&quot;; his distinctive voice brought him work for commercial and animation voiceovers. Appearances in 2009 included a guest role on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; on March 15, in which he played the role of a small newspaper editor; he also appeared in an episode of &quot;According to Jim&quot;. More recently, he appeared in the January 21, 2010, pilot episode of &quot;The Deep End&quot; on ABC as a retiring CEO with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He also made an appearance on &quot;Medium&quot; on the February 5, 2010, episode and a cameo on the June 26, 2011, season premiere of &quot;True Blood&quot; as the mayor of Bon Temps. He played Max Devore in the A&amp;E adaptation of &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;.

In 2010, Schallert made a series of public service announcement videos with Patty Duke and other castmates from &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; for the Social Security Administration. His last television appearance came in 2014 on an episode of the sitcom &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a 2014 interview, Schallert said that he was suffering from peripheral neuropathy, forcing him to wear leg braces while effectively &quot;confining&quot; him to a wheelchair. He said about his condition and the leg braces: &quot;They help me stay balanced if I use a walker, but it’s just easier to get around in a wheelchair.&quot; While not ruling out working on stage in the future, he said: &quot;Working in film or TV would be too difficult now. Besides, I did my share!&quot;

Schallert was married to actress Leah Waggner (born Rosemarie Diann Waggner) from 1949 until her death in 2015. She appeared with him in various shows, including episodes of &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show.&quot; They had four sons: William Joseph, Jr. (born 1949), Edwin G. (born 1952), Mark M. (born 1954), and Brendan C. Schallert (born 1961).

Schallert died on May 8, 2016, at his home in Pacific Palisades at the age of 93, six weeks after the death of his on-screen daughter Patty Duke, on March 29.
