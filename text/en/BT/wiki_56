<text>Geet Siriram Sethi (born 17 April 1961) of India is a professional player of English billiards who dominated the sport throughout much of the 1990s. He is also a notable amateur (ex-pro) snooker player. He is a five-time winner of the professional-level and a three-time winner of the amateur world championships, and holder of two world records, in English billiards. Along with Prakash Padukone, Sethi has co-founded Olympic Gold Quest, a foundation for the promotion of sports in India.

== Career ==

Born in Delhi and grew up in Ahmedabad, Sethi won his first major English billiards event in 1982, the Indian National Billiards Championship (an international event despite its name), defeating Michael Ferreira, and went on to win the NBC again four years in a row, 1985–1988, and made a comeback in both 1997 and 1998 to reclaim the title.

He rose to international prominence by winning the IBSF World Amateur Billiards Championships in 1985, versus Bob Marshall in an eight-hour-long final round. In 1987, he again won the IBSF event, as well as the ACBS Asian Billiards Championship He won another World Amateur Billiards title 2001, despite having previously played as a pro by that date.

Sethi also took the Indian National Snooker Championships four times back to back, in the same 1985–1988 span as his national English billiards streak. In the 1989 event, held at Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, though he did not take the title, he did achieve the world&#x27;s first amateur maximum break of 147 in official competition. He has never placed in the top snooker world rankings, however. Sethi is the only person in the history of cue-sports to have scored a maximum (147) in competitive snooker and a 1000+ break in competitive billiards.

In the 1992 World Professional Billiards Championship, Sethi constructed a world-record English billiards of 1276 in 80 minutes under the three-pot rule, also the highest break in five decades, and won first place. He went on to win the title again in 1993, 1995, 1998, and 2006.

In the 2006 event, in Prestatyn, Wales, he defeated David Causier in the quarter final, and defending World Pro Champion Chris Shutt in the semi-final. He won the title round 2073–1057 (average per 34.3 vs. 17.0) in a timed five-hour final against Lee Lagan (who had previously beaten him 6 to 5 at the untimed 2003 IBSF Amateur World Championship). After running two in the first hour, Sethi led by 150, increased this to 427 with two more centuries by the end of the first of the two , and followed it up with a of 238 ; meanwhile Langan only managed two centuries in the first session and one in the second.. When the time ran out, Sethi had just reached a double century again, at 206, and had been poised to continue the break.

He has been described as an &quot;arch-rival&quot; of Mike Russell of England, also an eight-time English billiards World Champion, and each of them had defeated the other for the title, with Russell victorious in 1996, and Sethi the winner in 1998, as of their next encounter at the 2007 event. They both scored two triple centuries apiece in the semi-finals, but Russell knocked Sethi out of the running, 1835–1231 (65.5 vs. 45.6 average); Russell eventually won the title, for his ninth World crown.

Sethi won gold and silver medals in doubles and singles English billiards respectively at the 13th Asian Games (1998, Bangkok, Thailand). He also won silver and bronze medals in doubles and singles English billiards respectively at the 14th Asian Games (2002, Busan, South Korea). At the 15th Asian Games (2006, Doha, Qatar), he took bronze medal in English billiards (men&#x27;s doubles with Ashok Harishankar Shandilya).

He has announced plans to compete in the Olympic Games for India when cue sports are finally admitted as Olympic sports (long in-progress between the World Confederation of Billiard Sports and the International Olympic Committee).

Sethi&#x27;s professional management agent, TNQ Sponsorship, commented that he &quot;has been focussing[&quot;sic&quot;] on the sport with renewed enthusiasm&quot; and &quot;seems to be peaking at the right time&quot;.

<doc id="574412" wikidata="Q1743088" url="?curid=574412" title="Salem (Israeli band)">
<text>Salem is an Israeli extreme metal band, pioneers of the oriental metal movement and of the Israeli heavy metal scene in general. Much of their lyrics and music deals with political issues concerning the Jewish people and Israel, most notably the concept albums &quot;Kaddish&quot; (1994) and &quot;Collective Demise&quot; (2002).

== History ==
Salem, the first extreme metal band in Israel, was formed in 1985, under the name Axe Metal, and is thus one of the first bands in the worldwide underground metal scene to play black metal. This can be heard in their self-titled rehearsal tape from 1986 and their live demo &quot;Destruction Till Death&quot; from 1987, recorded at the &#x27;Penguin&#x27; club, the only outlet for alternative music in Israel throughout the 1980s. This formula was later honed by bands such as Beherit and Blasphemy in the early 1990s.

After five years underground, the band released another live demo, &quot;Millions Slaughtered&quot; (1990), with a new line-up and a genre shift towards the death/doom realms. This demo sold 1,500 copies and led to a record deal with the German label Morbid Records. In the film &quot;Global Metal&quot;, drummer Nir Nakav recounted a story relating to the demotape that somehow ended up in the hands of the Norwegian Varg Vikernes, who contacted the band and noted that while he appreciated the music, he loathed the anti-Holocaust lyrics and wished the band to perish in the Gulf War. The band, infuriated, replied with a strongly worded letter; a few days later the band was contacted by local police, who had found a bomb in the mail from Norway.
The band&#x27;s official website describes this story in the following manner:
&quot;SALEM was formed in 1985 along with the newly born extreme metal scene and released 2 demo tapes called: &quot;Salem&quot;(1986) and &quot;Destruction till Death&quot; (1987). Back than, SALEM were in very good relations with Mayhem&#x27;s founder Euronymous who offered SALEM relocation to Norway and joining the black metal inner circle. Varg Vikernes of Burzum who disliked the band&#x27;s ideals thought differently and sent to vocalist Ze&#x27;ev Tananboim an explosive envelope by mail.&quot;

&quot;Creating Our Sins&quot; (1992) and &quot;Kaddish&quot; (1994) were released by Morbid Records and became the first metal albums from Israel to gain worldwide success. &quot;Kaddish&quot; is a concept album about the Holocaust. Prior to its release, Morbid Records released a 7&quot; picture EP with the single &quot;Dying Embers&quot; (1994) to promote the album, and when &quot;Kaddish&quot; came out, a limited edition picture disc was released. The opening song, &quot;The Fading,&quot; was played on MTV&#x27;s Headbanger&#x27;s Balls rotation and had the band elected as one of the 10 best up-and-coming bands in the world by MTV and &quot;Kerrang!&quot;.

&quot;Kaddish&quot; also featured a cover song in Hebrew called &quot;Ha&#x27;ayara Bo&#x27;eret&quot; (&quot;the small town is burning&quot;). The song was originally a poem written in Yiddish under the name &quot;S&#x27;brent&quot; (&quot;it is burning&quot;) by Polish-Jewish poet Mordechai Gebirtig in 1938, in response to the 1936 pogrom of Jews in the town of Przytyk near Radom. It was since translated into Hebrew, long before the band performed it. National controversy led to the Israeli parliament discussing whether it was appropriate for a metal band to play such songs.

In 1998, now with Israeli label B.N.E., the band enlisted producer Colin Richardson (Machine Head, Fear Factory), who flew over to Israel to record &quot;A Moment of Silence&quot;. The album was recorded in D.B. studios in Israel and The Chapel in England and was released late 1998. A big distribution deal with Modern Music (Germany) fell through due to miscommunication between B.N.E. and Salem.

In early 2001, Salem was released from their contract with B.N.E. In December 2001, Salem signed a three-album deal with KMG/System Shock from Germany. Their fourth album, &quot;Collective Demise&quot;, was released in September 2002, the most aggressive Salem album to date, produced by the band and recorded in D.B. Studios and Noise Studios in Israel. Most of the songs deal with the second Intifada.

In 2005 Salem released &quot;Strings Attached&quot;, 11 previously recorded songs now re-recorded with added string instruments. The album was also released as a special edition with a bonus CD, including four live performances from the &quot;Live Demise&quot; DVD, which was shot in July 2006.

Salem&#x27;s sixth studio album was &quot;Necessary Evil&quot;. It included a 27-minute-long piece, &quot;Once Upon a Lifetime Parts I – V&quot;, and a short protest song called &quot;Amona&quot;, dealing with the 2005 events in Amona. The album was released in June 2007. That month the band performed for the first time ever outside of Israel, during the Hellfest festival in Clisson, France.

On 11 December 2009, it was announced that Salem was signed by Pulverised Records to release their upcoming seventh studio album &quot;Playing God and Other Short Stories&quot; on 3 April 2010 in Israel, 26 April 2010 in Europe and 25 May 2010 in the US.

On 6 May 2011, the band celebrated the re-release of their classic album &quot;Kadish&quot;, playing a special show at the Reading 3 club in Tel Aviv, where they were joined for most of the show by Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal.

On 29 July 2019, Michael Goldstein, the band&#x27;s former long-time bassist died while residing in the United States. On 7 December 2019, the band held a fundraising concert to help cover for the medical bills which mounted leading up to Goldstein&#x27;s death. The concert was held at the Gagarin club in Tel Aviv. Founding members of Orphaned Land, Kobi Farhi and Uri Zelha, joined Salem on stage as Zelha, Orphaned Land&#x27;s bassist, played bass for Salem for the entire show. Other bands who played during the fundraising concert were Spawn of Evil, Arallu, Tomorrow&#x27;s Rain and Shredhead.

== Musical style ==
Salem&#x27;s music is a combination of doom/death metal (slow-paced death metal) with oriental elements and high-pitched screaming-vocals (distorted hoarse screams). Riffing, henceforth, can range from slow and heavy doom metal riffing to very fast and rapid death metal riffing. This sound evolved from Salem&#x27;s original style (first two demos), which was old-school black metal. Salem&#x27;s latest two studio albums are much heavier than their former LPs.

In some songs, Salem uses oriental (Jewish and Middle-eastern) melodies, such as &quot;Act of Terror&quot;, &quot;Al Taster&quot;, and the intro for &quot;Ha&#x27;ayara Bo&#x27;eret&quot;. In &quot;Collective Demise&quot;, female vocals were combined with Tananboim&#x27;s singing.

Salem has thus far recorded two songs in Hebrew: Mordechai Gebirtig&#x27;s &quot;Ha&#x27;ayara Boe&#x27;ret,&quot; and &quot;Al Taster&quot;, taken from Psalms. These along with some Orphaned Land songs are among the few extreme metal songs sung in Hebrew.

<doc id="574414" wikidata="Q6970828" url="?curid=574414" title="National Audit Office (United Kingdom)">
<text>The National Audit Office (NAO) is an independent Parliamentary body in the United Kingdom which is responsible for auditing central government departments, government agencies and non-departmental public bodies. The NAO also carries out value for money (VFM) audits into the administration of public policy.

==Function==
The NAO is the auditor of bodies funded directly by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

The NAO reports to the Comptroller and Auditor General who is an officer of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and in turn reports to the Public Accounts Commission, a statutory body established under section 2 of the National Audit Act 1983. The reports produced by the NAO are reviewed by the Public Accounts Committee, a select committee of the House of Commons, and in some cases investigated further.

The NAO has two main streams of work: Financial Audits and Value For Money (VFM) audits.

The NAO&#x27;s financial audits give assurance over three aspects of government expenditure: the truth and fairness of financial statements; the regularity (or statutory validity) of the expenditure, and; the propriety of the audited body&#x27;s conduct in accordance with parliamentary, statutory and public expectations. Financial audits are carried out in much the same way as private auditing bodies and the NAO voluntarily applies the International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). The NAO is subject to inspection by the Audit Quality Review team of the Financial Reporting Council.

Value for Money (VFM) audits are non-financial audits to measure the effectiveness, economy and efficiency of government spending. Roughly sixty of these reports are produced each year, the most notable from recent years being the reports on MRSA, which led to an increase in public interest in the topic, the report on the rescue of British Energy and the report in the Public Private Partnership to maintain the London Underground. The remits of the NAO and the Public Accounts Committee do not allow them to question the policy itself and so VFM reports only examine the implementation of policy. The responsibility for questioning policy is left for other select committees and debating chambers of Parliament, but this has not prevented the PAC being named committee of the year in 2006.

&quot;Good Governance&quot;, an output somewhere between financial and VFM audits, was previously a strand of NAO work, but is no longer a focus of activity. The NAO does, however, publish best practice guidance for public sector organisations. An example includes the fact sheet on governance statements. In addition, the NAO undertakes fast-paced and more narrowly focused work called investigations.

The NAO received new powers under the Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 to provide an end-to-end view of policy implementation, and produce reports aimed at the local government sector.

===The Comptroller Function===
The Comptroller Function is administered by the Exchequer Section within the NAO.

Its work centres on recording all transactions to and from the Consolidated and National Loans funds. Money cannot be paid from either of these without the C&amp;AG&#x27;s prior approval. This approval is granted every banking day through a mechanism known as &#x27;the credit&#x27;. The Exchequer Section is also responsible for agreeing payments from the Consolidated Fund directly to certain bodies, including the King (through the civil list) and judicial salaries.

===Parliamentary links===

The NAO produces a number of briefings for select committees, but its key audience is the Public Accounts Committee. It also has a strong relationship with the Public Accounts Commission that oversees the work of the NAO and approves its budgets.

;Public Accounts Committee
The NAO and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) form the key links of the public audit cycle, which has the following sequence:
*The NAO performs financial and VFM audits and makes its reports public
*The PAC has hearings based on NAO reports wherein failures in meeting regularity or propriety requirements are apparent.
*The PAC provides a report with recommendations based on PAC hearings.
*The Government responds to the PAC report in a Treasury Minute.
*The NAO publishes a reply to the minute and there may be an NAO/PAC follow-up study.

;Public Accounts Commission
The Public Accounts Commission (TPAC) annually approves the NAO&#x27;s corporate plans and budgets. It also receives value for money reports on the operation of the NAO. These are written by private sector audit firms in much the same manner as the NAO reports on Central Government.

===International Work===
The National Audit Office is a member of the International Organisation of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The NAO shares knowledge and experience with other Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) around the world and undertakes the audit of some international bodies. For example, between 2010 and 2016 the C&amp;AG was one of three members of the United Nations Board of Auditors, responsible for auditing the United Nations itself, including peacekeeping operations and related organisations such as UNICEF and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

==History==
The earliest known mention of a public official responsible for auditing government expenditure is a reference made in 1314 to the &quot;Auditor of the Exchequer&quot;.

===Auditors of the Imprest (1559–1785)===

In 1559 an office was set up, with responsibility for auditing Exchequer payments, called the Auditors of the Imprest.

===Commission for Auditing the Public Accounts (1785–1866)===

In 1785 a &quot;Commission for Auditing the Public Accounts&quot; was established by statute (the former arrangement having fallen into abeyance). Its members, the Commissioners of Audit, were five in number (increased to ten in 1806). The Commissioners worked closely with the Comptroller of the Exchequer (who was charged with controlling the issue of funds to the government) following the establishment of that office in 1834.

===Exchequer and Audit Department (1867–1984)===

Under the terms of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, the offices of the Comptroller of the Exchequer and the Commissioners of Audit were merged and their duties vested in a new official: the Comptroller and Auditor General (formally the &quot;Comptroller General of the Receipt and Issue of Her Majesty&#x27;s Exchequer and Auditor General of Public Accounts&quot;).

===National Audit Office (1984–present)===
The NAO developed from the former Exchequer and Audit Department (founded in 1866) in 1983 as the auditor for central government (including most of the externalised agencies and public bodies) as part of an &quot;appropriate mechanism&quot; to check and reinforce departmental balance and matching of quantitative allocation with qualitative purpose (as set out by public policy). The existence and work of the NAO are underpinned by three fundamental principles of public audit:

*Independence of auditors from the audited (executives and Parliament)
*Auditing for: regularity, propriety and VFM (value for money)
*Public reporting that enables democratic and managerial accountability

The basic need for the NAO arises from these three fundamental principles, in that, as Parliament votes on public expenditure of various activities by public bodies, they need auditors that are independent of the body in question, the government and/or opposing political parties; while auditing for compliance and legal spending by departments on the activities voted for by Parliament, in a transparent and public forum.

==Structure==
The NAO is based in London and Newcastle and has a staff of 800. Part of the NAO&#x27;s London Office is a listed building, originally built for Imperial Airways as their &quot;Empire Terminal&quot;. The building underwent a £60m restoration and refurbishment, completed in 2009. The NAO rents part of its offices to tenants, generating income of £1.1m in 2019–20. The building is a modern, open plan office and the refurbishment enabled the NAO to introduce many environmentally friendly features, such as rain-water harvesting.

The NAO is structured into Directorates, each with a responsibility for a government department (for instance, the Home Office or Department for Culture, Media and Sport). Each Directorate contains 20–30 staff, many of whom are qualified accountants or in training for qualification with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). Within Directorates, staff will be split between Financial Audit and Value for Money work and include staff of the following grades:

*Analyst: Junior researcher on a value for money engagement;
*Assistant Auditors: auditors employed on a three-year training contract, leading to a qualification with the ICAEW;
*Auditors: auditors that have completed their ICAEW exams but have not yet obtained the full qualification;
*Senior analyst: Oversees value for money studies;
*Audit Principals: senior auditors, with responsibility for leading a financial audit engagement;
*Audit Managers (Civil Service equivalent Grade 7): oversee a portfolio of audit engagements or a value for money studies;
*Director: (Civil Service equivalent Grade 5/SCS 1): responsibility for a directorate.

Above director grade, Directors General have responsibility for specific cross NAO functions (such as Audit Practice and Quality, and Finance and Commerce) and Executive Leaders (previously &quot;Assistant Auditors General&quot;) support the Board.

The NAO has finance, human resource and ICT functions to support its operations.

===Governance===
Following the controversy over a previous C&amp;AG&#x27;s expenses (see Criticisms) the governance arrangements of the NAO were overhauled and a Board was put in place to oversee the running of the organisation. The Board is made up of

*Non-executive chairman – Fiona Reynolds
*Comptroller and Auditor General – Gareth Davies 
*Chief operating officer responsible for the day-to-day running of the NAO – Michael Whitehouse
*Three other Executive Directors
*Four non-Executive Directors

==Criticisms==
Some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the NAO include the following:
*Strategic nature of reports: the NAO produces a wide range of reports on all aspects of central government expenditure, but many of these deal with marginal topics like government leaflets, countryside rights of way and railway stations. David Walker of &quot;The Guardian&quot; argues that the NAO does not and cannot examine major strategic issues such as the underlying principles of the Private Finance Initiative.
*Treatment of value for money in reports: the NAO uses a broad brush definition of &#x27;value for money&#x27; to plan and carry out its reports. The reports do not focus purely on detailed financial analysis of whether or not a particular scheme or initiative is value for money. Instead, they include qualitative analysis of costs and benefits to give a more comprehensive assessment. In 2005, an NAO report on NHS Local Investment Finance Trust (LIFT) was criticised by one of the PAC members at the time, Jon Trickett, for its focus on qualitative analysis of the benefits of LIFT schemes and the paucity of its financial analysis. 
*Expenses: in May 2007, &quot;Private Eye&quot; released information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act detailing the travel expenses of the then head of the NAO, Sir John Bourn. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; subsequently reported that Bourn spent £365,000 for travel and £27,000 in restaurant bills over three years, as well as a potential conflict of interest by accepting hospitality from BAE Systems. After initially rebuffing criticisms of these issues, in October 2007 Sir John Bourn announced that he would step down in January 2008.
*The NAO was accused of hampering a police investigation into the Al Yamamah deal by several MPs in July 2006.

<text>Blase Thomas Golisano (born November 14, 1941) is an American billionaire businessman and philanthropist.

He is the founder of Paychex, which offers payroll and human resources services to businesses. Golisano owned Greenlight Networks, a fiber internet provider based in Rochester, New York, from 2019 to 2022. He owned the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League and Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League from 2003 to 2011. Golisano unsuccessfully ran for Governor of New York as a third-party candidate in 1994, 1998, and 2002. As of 2020, Golisano had a net worth of US$5.2 billion.

==Business==

Paychex was founded by Golisano in 1971. He started the company with $3,000 and a credit card. Golisano served as its president and Chief Executive Officer from 1971 to October 2004. He has been the Chairman of Paychex since October 1, 2004, and its Director since 1979.

In April 2018, it was announced that Golisano was purchasing Greenlight Networks, a Rochester-based fiber internet provider and local competitor to Frontier Communications and Charter Spectrum that was established in 2012. Following Golisano&#x27;s purchase of Greenlight, the company began expanding into new areas due to a $100 million investment by Golisano. However in 2022, Golisano sold his controlling equity shares of Greenlight Networks to the investment firm Oak Hill.

The 2020 Forbes 400 list stated that Golisano was the 238th wealthiest person in America with a net worth of $3.4 billion as of September 2020. The 2022 list of The World&#x27;s Billionaires by Forbes ranked Golisano as the 490th wealthy billionaire with a net worth of $5.4 billion. In 2023, he was ranked as the 552nd wealthiest billionaire in the world with a net worth of $4.9 billion.

==Professional sports==
Golisano is a former co-owner (along with real estate developer Larry Quinn) of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team and of the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse team. He purchased the Sabres from the NHL who had stripped the team from their previous owner John Rigas, the former Adelphia CEO who was charged and convicted of bank fraud, wire fraud, and securities fraud and had owned the team since 1997. He sold the Sabres and its assets to billionaire Terrence Pegula in February 2011. Golisano made a bid for the bankrupt Los Angeles Dodgers franchise in early 2012, but his group was eventually outbid by a consortium led by Magic Johnson and the Guggenheim Partners. In order to help keep the team in western NY, he also made a bid for the Buffalo Bills when that franchise came up for sale in 2014; that team was also ultimately purchased by Pegula.

==Political involvement==
Golisano is a founding member of the Independence Party of New York and ran on its ticket for governor of New York in 1994, 1998 and 2002. Although he was never elected, his percentage of the vote increased with each election. He spent a combined $93 million on the three campaigns. By receiving more than 50,000 votes each time, Golisano brought the Independence Party an automatic ballot line for the succeeding four years.
After New York&#x27;s Republican governor, George Pataki announced he would not run again in the 2006 election, Republican officials attempted to recruit Golisano to run for the Republican nomination. He changed his party affiliation to Republican, with the Independence Party&#x27;s chairman&#x27;s blessing, in October 2005, apparently in preparation for another gubernatorial run. In February 2006, Golisano announced that he would not run for the governorship.

In August 2008, Golisano contributed $1 million to the Democratic National Convention.

In July 2008, Golisano formed a PAC called Responsible New York and funded it with $5 million of his own money. The PAC gives money to candidates for the New York state legislature, regardless of party, and supports candidates for property tax cuts and election reform.

In October 2008, Golisano voiced his opinion in favor of term limits for public offices in New York City. Golisano vowed to fight Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s proposal to extend term limits, arguing that the people of New York City have voted twice in favor of the current law. There was speculation that he would run for governor again on the Republican ticket, but it was announced, on May 15, 2009, that he was moving to Florida to escape New York&#x27;s high taxes.

In June 2009, Golisano took partial credit for creating the 2009 New York State Senate leadership crisis in which Republicans temporarily seized control of a body that still retained a Democratic enrollment edge. Golisano, who had supported a number of Democratic Party candidates during the 2008 election, was dissatisfied with things like the Democrats&#x27; effort to solve the state&#x27;s budget crisis by raising taxes on New York&#x27;s wealthiest residents. He orchestrated the defection of Democratic senators Pedro Espada Jr. and Hiram Monserrate, who voted with Republicans to reinstate Dean Skelos as majority leader. The attempted coup failed when Espada and Monserrate returned to the Senate Democratic Conference.

In February 2011, Golisano became the spokesman for National Popular Vote Inc., a non-profit organization seeking to implement a popular vote system for presidential elections by harnessing the electoral college.

In January 2018, Golisano announced the formation of a campaign called Tax My Property Fairly. The stated purpose of the campaign is &quot;to help Upstate New York homeowners fight for fair property taxes.&quot;

==Philanthropy==

As of Jan. 2021, Golisano has pledged or donated more than $300 million to a variety of philanthropic causes.

Golisano founded the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation in 1985 with an initial gift of $90,000. The Foundation awards grants to organizations dedicated to providing opportunities for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their families.

In October 2008, Golisano donated $10 million to Niagara University for a new B. Thomas Golisano Center for Integrated Sciences building.

In November 2009, Golisano donated $4 million to Ave Maria University for the construction of a new field house.

In 2012, Golisano donated $12 million to the Special Olympics to launch the Healthy Communities initiative. The purpose of the initiative is to increase year-round access to health care for people with intellectual disabilities. He made an additional commitment of $25 million to Special Olympics in 2015 to expand Healthy Communities to 100 locations around the world. This was the largest single gift to an organization made by Golisano and the largest single gifts ever received from an individual by Special Olympics. Also in 2012, Golisano donated $20 million to build a new Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital at Lee Health in southwest Florida which opened in Spring 2017.

In 2014, the Golisano Neurology and Rehabilitation Center opened at Unity Hospital in Rochester, funded in part by a $10 million contribution from Golisano.

Golisano and the Golisano Foundation were recognized among 30 givers and causes on Forbes&#x27; &quot;Philanthropy&#x27;s Big Bets for Social Change of 2015.&quot;

In June 2016, the Golisano Center for Community Health opened its doors to patients. The center, which provides integrated health care to people with disabilities and their families, was made possible with a gift of $3.5 million from Golisano. In September 2016, Golisano gave $7.5 million to Nazareth University for a new athletic training center that will aim to be a model of inclusion, fitness and wellness, and is expected to open in 2018. Also in September 2016, Golisano gave $2 million to the WXXI Public Broadcasting Council for equipment. This was his second gift to WXXI; he gave $2 million in 2004 to allow WXXI to upgrade to digital broadcasting equipment.

In April 2017, the City of Rochester announced modified Rochester Broadway Theatre League proposal for Midtown Plaza which in partnership with Morgan Development would include a performing arts center to be called the Golisano Center for the Performing Arts in honor of a donation made to the project by Golisano. Also in 2017, at the Special Olympics World Games, the first Golisano Global Health Care Leadership Awards were presented to recognize those who are advancing inclusive health for people with intellectual disabilities.

Golisano donated $14 million to the University of Rochester, which renamed their pediatric facility at Strong Memorial Hospital the Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital in 2002. In 2012, Golisano pledged an additional $20 million to URMC to build a new Golisano Children&#x27;s Hospital, which opened in 2015.

In April 2017, Golisano and the Golisano Foundation pledged $3 million to construct a facility dedicated to providing services to families of autistic children and adults in the city of Rochester. The Golisano Autism Center, which opened in September 2019 in a new 33,000 sq. ft. building, is unique in how it integrated numerous recreational, medical and educational support providers and services into one location.

In 2024, Golisano donated $360 million to 82 different non-profits across Upstate New York.

==Golisano Institute for Business and Entrepreneurship==
Golisano founded the Golisano Institute for Business and Entrepreneurship in Brighton, NY, that opened fall 2023. The school offers two-year certificates, focuses exclusively on business coursework, and caps enrollment at 500 students. Golisano has said the school is oriented to &quot;reducing the time and cost of business-related education.&quot; The business institute is housed in a former Paychex building that Golisano bought for $10 million in October 2022. A WXXI News report stated the school is a &quot;nonprofit venture&quot; and reported that Golisano is &quot;bankrolling the institution, but he is not running it.&quot; Tuition is $8,900 per year, and the Thomas Golisano Foundation is covering the school&#x27;s operating costs.

Golisano hired Ian Mortimer, who was previously the associate provost at the Rochester Institute of Technology, as the school&#x27;s first president.

==&quot;Built Not Born&quot;==
In February 2020, Golisano released &quot;Built, Not Born: A Self-Made Billionaire&#x27;s No-Nonsense Guide for Entrepreneurs&quot;, co-authored by Mike Wicks. The book, published by HarperCollins, contains business advice drawn from Golisano&#x27;s fifty years of experience. The book reached #1 on Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s bestselling business book charts.

==Personal life==
Three times divorced, Golisano is married to former tennis player Monica Seles.

<doc id="574429" wikidata="Q801506" url="?curid=574429" title="Takadanobaba Station">
<text>is a railway station in the Takadanobaba area of Tokyo&#x27;s Shinjuku ward, situated between the commercial districts of Ikebukuro and Shinjuku.

The station is a major commuting hub, linking the Seibu Shinjuku Line, Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line and Yamanote Line. It also serves the surrounding Takadanobaba area, known as a popular student district, and is linked by bus to nearby Waseda University. It is the busiest station on the Seibu Shinjuku Line, and the second-busiest in the Seibu Railway network after Ikebukuro Station. It is the ninth-busiest station in the Tokyo Metro network and the eleventh-busiest station in the JR East network.

==Lines==
Takadanobaba Station is served by the following lines:

*East Japan Railway Company (JR East)
** Yamanote Line
*Seibu Railway
** Seibu Shinjuku Line
*Tokyo Metro
**Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line

==Station layout==
===Platforms===

====Yamanote and Seibu Shinjuku Line====
The Yamanote Line island platform and two Seibu Shinjuku Line platforms are located parallel to each other, and are connected by an overhead transfer concourse, as well as transfer gates at ground level by the main Waseda exit.



The theme music from &quot;Astro Boy&quot; is played prior to each train departure from the Yamanote Line platform, a homage to the series being set in the Takadanobaba area. Chest-high platform edge doors were brought into use on the Yamanote Line platform on 21 December 2013.

The Yamanote Freight Line tracks (used by Saikyo Line and Shonan-Shinjuku Line services) pass Takadanobaba running between the Yamanote Line and Seibu Shinjuku Line tracks.
====Tozai Line====

==History==
The Yamanote Line station opened on 15 September 1910.

Seibu Railway opened a temporary station perpendicular to the Yamanote Line in April 1927, followed by a permanent station parallel to the Yamanote Line in April 1928. The original station buildings were burned to the ground during the bombing of Tokyo in April 1945. Takadanobaba was the Tokyo terminal of the Seibu Railway Murayama Line (now Seibu Shinjuku Line) until it was extended to Seibu-Shinjuku Station in 1952.

The Tozai Line began service to Takadanobaba in December 1964 under the auspices of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority. Takadanobaba was the western terminus of the Tozai Line until the connection to Nakano Station and the Chuo Main Line opened in March 1966.

The station facilities of the Tozai Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

Station numbering was introduced on all Seibu Railway lines during fiscal 2012, with Takadanobaba being assigned station number SS02. Numbering was expanded to the JR East platforms in 2016 with the Yamanote Line station being assigned station number JY15.
==Surrounding area==
The surrounding area of Takadanobaba is often referred to as &quot;Baba&quot;. It lacks the history of nearby Waseda and Mejiro, often conjuring up images of a student spot with its many cheap bars and izakaya serving the needs of students at nearby Waseda and Gakushuin universities.

The symbol of Takadanobaba is the monolithic and appropriately named Big Box building next to the station. Big Box houses a sports gym, swimming pool, Uniqlo clothing store, cafe, bowling alley, arcade, and a fast food restaurant. It has recently been reopened after an extensive renovation.

==Passenger statistics==
Daily average passenger figures for each operator are as shown below.

<doc id="574434" wikidata="Q878798" url="?curid=574434" title="Hugh Carey">
<text>Hugh Leo Carey (April 11, 1919 – August 7, 2011) was an American politician and attorney of the Democratic Party who served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1961 to 1974 and as the 51st governor of New York from 1975 to 1982.

== Early life ==
Carey was born in New York City, the son of Margaret (née Collins) and Dennis Joseph Carey. Among his siblings were brothers Edward M. Carey (former president of Carey Energy Corporation) and Martin T. Carey (an entrepreneur who owned Winfield Hall and Bogheid in Glen Cove and Seaview Terrace in Newport).

=== Education and military service ===
In 1939, Carey enlisted in the New York National Guard as a private in C Squadron, 101st Cavalry. Later, he served as a major in the 104th Infantry Division, known as the
&quot;Timberwolves&quot;. He served in the 415th Infantry Regiment of the 104th Division as the Regimental S-3, operations officer. Carey was with the 104th Division throughout its 10-month campaign in the European Theater of Operations, which included the fighting in Northern France, Holland and Germany. His awards include the Combat Infantryman Badge, the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star. He was discharged in 1946 at the rank of colonel.

He received his B.A. from St. John&#x27;s University in 1942. Following his military service, he enrolled at the institution&#x27;s law school, where he earned his J.D. in 1951. He was admitted to the New York state bar that same year.

== Career ==
Carey was a partner in the law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey. Carey became involved in politics following his wartime service. In 1946, he was named co-chair of a New York State Democratic Committee youth division that was intended to attract young voters to support Democratic candidates.

===U.S. House of Representatives===

In 1960, running as a Democrat, Carey was elected to the United States House of Representatives from a district generally centered around Brooklyn&#x27;s Park Slope, Sunset Park and Bay Ridge neighborhoods, unseating Republican incumbent Francis E. Dorn. Carey&#x27;s seven terms in office coincided with major demographic changes in his district, as exemplified by deindustrialization and the decline of the Sunset Park waterfront&#x27;s longstanding breakbulk cargo businesses; the concomitant emergence of gentrification in eastern Park Slope; the coalescence of a nascent Puerto Rican community in western Park Slope and Sunset Park; and the opening of Bay Ridge&#x27;s Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge (which spurred migration by many working-class whites in his district to the more suburban borough of Staten Island) in 1964. Although he has been erroneously characterized as the first congressman to oppose the Vietnam War (a stance actually taken by Morningside Heights-based congressman William Fitts Ryan), he may have been the first member of the Brooklyn congressional delegation to speak out against the conflict following discussions with several of his children.

In 1966, he was appointed Chairman of the Ad hoc Subcommittee on the Handicapped by Adam Clayton Powell, then Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. The sub-committee held hearings in Washington and New York City and Carey introduced HR 14. The &quot;Carey Bill&quot; provided, for the first time, a program of grants to the states for &quot;initiating, expanding or improving education for children with disabilities. It also included other titles mirroring the structure of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, PL 89–10, which Carey had assisted Powell in passing as part of the Lyndon Baines Johnson initiative.

Three parts of the Bill were picked up by the Senate: the grants to states, a new Bureau of Education for the Handicapped in the U.S. Office of Education and a National Advisory Committee. Carey&#x27;s friend and mentor, John Fogerty of Rhode Island, the powerful Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee which provided funding for all Health, Education and Welfare programs, backed his legislation. The bill became Title VI of the ESEA, as Public Law 89-750, in 1966. Carey also sponsored and saw passed that year The Model Secondary School for the Deaf Bill, to be established on the campus of the world&#x27;s only liberal arts college for the deaf. In 1965, he and Fogerty had sponsored The National Technical Institute for the Deaf, which was awarded to the Rochester Institute of Technology.

The Carey Bill and its grant program to the states began with a $2.5 million appropriation, to provide each state with $50,000 to plan for its implementation. The second year, the appropriation was $12.25 million, distributed to the states in proportion to their population. In 1975 Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Bill, PL 94-142 which today distributes approximately $11 billion to the states for this purpose.

He served on the House Ways and Means Committee and led the effort to pass the first Federal Aid to Education program. He was elected Governor of New York in 1974 and resigned his Congressional seat on December 31, 1974.

=== City politics===
In 1969 Carey ran briefly for the Democratic nomination for Mayor. He then agreed to run for City Council President on the ticket led by former Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. Carey narrowly lost the primary to incumbent City Council President Francis X. Smith. Then he briefly mounted an independent bid for Mayor, from which he withdrew after the death of his two eldest sons in a car accident.

=== Governor of New York ===

In the state election of 1974, Carey became New York&#x27;s first Democratic governor in 16 years, defeating Howard Samuels for the Democratic nomination and then unseating incumbent Republican Malcolm Wilson, who had assumed the office after Nelson Rockefeller resigned in December 1973 to serve on the Commission on Critical Choices for Americans. Nationally, the 1974 election was dominated by the Watergate scandal, which had destroyed President Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency and hurt Republicans nationwide. In 1974, Democrats also recaptured the New York State Assembly.

Carey is best remembered for his successful handling of New York City&#x27;s economic crisis in the mid-1970s. Carey came into office with New York City close to bankruptcy and is credited with bringing business and labor together to help save New York City from the fiscal crisis. Carey managed to keep the growth of state spending below the rate of inflation through his frequent use of line-item vetoes and fights with the New York State Legislature, which was at the time divided between a Republican-controlled Senate and a Democratic-controlled Assembly.

Upon taking office, Carey cut taxes significantly, reducing corporate taxes from 14% to 10%, and capping personal income tax at 9%, and reducing capital gains taxes as well. His administration also offered tax credits to encourage new investment. As governor, he was responsible for building the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center; Battery Park City; the South Street Seaport and the economic development of New York City&#x27;s outer boroughs. He also helped provide state funding for the construction of the Carrier Dome at Syracuse University. He is also remembered for preventing conservative legislators from reinstating the death penalty and preventing such legislators from taking away state abortion laws.

Carey signed the Willowbrook Consent Decree, which ended the hospitalisation of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. His vision and leadership led to the community placement of the mentally ill and developmentally disabled, but also an increase of these people living on the streets. He also made major strides in community programs for the mentally ill. Carey also pardoned Cleveland &quot;Jomo&quot; Davis, one of the leaders of the Attica prison riots.

Carey&#x27;s tenure in office was marked by a growing awareness of the environmental consequences of New York&#x27;s strong industrial base, including the designation by the federal government of the Love Canal disaster area. Carey made environmental issues a priority of his administration. Carey was vilified by Love Canal residents for being more concerned about the state&#x27;s finances than the health of families living amidst one of the nation&#x27;s most infamous environmental disasters.

Along with Senators Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan and U.S. House Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill, Carey led efforts to end the violence in Northern Ireland and support peace in the region. The four Irish-American politicians called themselves &quot;The Four Horsemen.&quot;

In 1977, he suffered a major setback, when he lost the case Carey v. Population Services International. He batted for a law which prevented &quot;Population Services International&quot; [PSI] to distribute contraceptives to minors below 16 years. But Supreme Court thought otherwise. According to the Supreme Court, it was a violation of minors&#x27; right to privacy.

Carey considered running for president in 1976 and 1980. Carey&#x27;s first wife had died in 1974, and Carey later attributed his decision not to seek the Democratic nomination for president in 1976 to her death. In 1978, he was challenged for re-election by State Assembly Minority Leader and former Assembly Speaker Perry Duryea. After a competitive, sometimes negative campaign, Carey was the first Democrat re-elected in 40 years. In 1980 he decriminalized homosexuality in New York State.

According to political scientist and author Daniel C. Kramer &quot;The Carey Administration had a hand in many important projects, the modernization of New York City&#x27;s subways and the rescue of homeowners living in the Love Canal neighborhood being just two, before Carey committed several serious blunders which lowered voters&#x27; opinion of him that he decided not to run for reelection in 1982. Through it all, this man with the embarassingly-low poll ratings turned into a superb governor.&quot;16 On January 1, 1983, he was succeeded by his lieutenant governor, Mario Cuomo.

===Later career===
In 1989, Carey announced that he was no longer pro-choice and regretted his support for legalized abortion and public financing of abortion as governor. In 1992, he joined other anti-abortion leaders in signing the anti-abortion document &quot;A New American Compact: Caring About Women, Caring for the Unborn.&quot;

Later in his life, he was of counsel at the law firm of Shea &amp; Gould. He continued to practice law as a member of the Harris Beach law firm and sat on the board of Triarc Cos., the Nelson Peltz controlled holding company.

== Personal life ==
In 1947, Carey married Helen Owen (1924–1974). They became the parents of Alexandria, Christopher, Susan, Peter, Hugh Jr., Michael, Donald, Marianne, Nancy, Helen, Bryan, Paul, Kevin, and Thomas. Beginning in 1961, the family resided at 61 Prospect Park West, a 1910 Park Slope mansion built for the daughter of Bon Ami Company chairman and Progressive Era philanthropist William H. Childs; a decade later, Carey sold the home to journalist Pete Hamill. His wife, Helen, died of breast cancer in 1974. Peter and Hugh Jr. died in an automobile accident in 1969. Carey was devastated by the death of his wife and laid to rest any plans for the White House. Paul, who served as White House Special Assistant to President Bill Clinton as well as 77th Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, died of cancer in 2001.

In 1981, Carey married Evangeline Gouletas, a Chicago-based real estate mogul, just three months after meeting her. This marriage proved controversial and a political liability. The marriage generated controversy due to false statements Gouletas made about her marital history. Initially, Gouletas claimed that she was a widow of a single marriage but later affirmed on the marriage license that she had two ex-husbands. Gouletas also said that her first husband, with whom she had a daughter, was dead, but he was still alive at the time. In reality, she actually had three previous marriages, and all three of her former husbands were still living at the time. The marriage also caused trouble for Carey with the Catholic Church, since he married a thrice-divorced woman in a Greek Orthodox Church; the church, which does not recognize civil no-fault divorce, refused to perform communion. To an extent, the marriage also hurt his public reputation. Carey and Gouletas divorced in 1989.
Carey later described this marriage as &quot;his greatest failure.&quot;Carey died surrounded by his family on August 7, 2011, aged 92. He was at his summer home on Shelter Island, New York.

=== Legacy ===
On October 22, 2009, he was named as the recipient of University at Albany Foundation&#x27;s Citizen Laureate Award. On October 22, 2012, the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel was officially renamed the &quot;Hugh L. Carey Tunnel&quot;.
Building 14 at the Rochester Institute of Technology was named for Carey in 1984.

<text>The Mologa () is a river in Maksatikhinsky, Bezhetsky, Lesnoy, and Sandovsky Districts of Tver Oblast, Pestovsky District in Novgorod Oblast, and Ustyuzhensky and Cherepovetsky Districts in Vologda Oblast Russia. It is a left tributary of the Volga. The lower course of the Mologa has been turned into the Rybinsk Reservoir. It is long, and the area of its basin . The principal tributaries of the Mologa are the Osen (right), the Volchina (left), the Kobozha (left), the Chagodoshcha (left) and the Sit (it is now a tributary of the Rybinsk Reservoir).

The towns of Bezhetsk, Pestovo, and Ustyuzhna, and the urban-type settlement of Maksatikha are on the banks of the Mologa River. The historic town of Mologa used to stand at the confluence of the Mologa river with the Volga, but it was submerged as the Rybinsk Reservoir was filled between 1939 and 1947. The town of Vesyegonsk was also previously on the banks of the Mologa, however, it was relocated when the Rybinsk Reservoir was filled, and is on the banks of the reservoir.

The source of the Mologa is in the southeastern part of Maksatikhinsky District, in the eastern outskirts of Valdai Hills. The river flows east, enters Bezhetsky District, turns north, flows through the town of Bezhetsk, and flows into Lake Verestovo. It flows out of the lake in the western direction, reenters Maksatikhinsky District, flows through the urban-type settlement of Maksatikha and turns north. A stretch of the Mologa forms the border between Maksatikhinsky and Lesnoy Districts. The river crosses over to Lesnoy District, crosses it, flows at the border between Lesnoy and Sandovsky districts and crosses into Novgorod Oblast. Downstream of the town of Pestovo, the Mologa turns northeast and enters Vologda Oblast. There, it flows through the town of Ustyuzhna, accepts from the left the Kobozha and the Chagodoshcha, sharply turns southeast and flows into the Rybinsk Reservoir.

The river basin of the Mologa comprises vast areas in the north of Tver Oblast, in the east of Novgorod Oblast, in the southeast of Leningrad Oblast (Boksitogorsky District), as well as the southeast of Vologda Oblast.

The lower course of the Mologa, downstream of the mouth of the Chagodoshcha, belongs to Tikhvinskaya water system, one of the waterways constructed in the early 19th century to connect the river basins of the Volga and the Neva. Currently, it is not used for any commercial navigation.

Until the 1990s, the Mologa was used for timber rafting, with the timber-collecting facilities in Pestovo.

The river freezes up in late October through early December and stays under the ice until April or early May.

<text>The Willamette Shore Trolley is a heritage railroad or heritage streetcar that operates along the west bank of the Willamette River between Portland and Lake Oswego in the U.S. state of Oregon. The right-of-way is owned by a group of local-area governments who purchased it in 1988 in order to preserve it for potential future rail transit. Streetcar excursion service began operating on a trial basis in 1987, lasting about three months, and regular operation on a long-term basis began in 1990. The Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society has been the line&#x27;s operator since 1995.

The railroad offers passenger excursions using a historic or replica-historic trolley on a former Southern Pacific line previously known as the Jefferson Street branch. The line runs for , including a passage through the Elk Rock Tunnel. The Lake Oswego terminal is downtown, alongside State Street (Oregon Route 43) just south of A Avenue. The location of the Portland terminal has varied over the years, but since fall 2003 it has been at SW Bancroft Street and Moody Avenue in the new high-density South Waterfront neighborhood under construction, a location that was only one block south of the Portland Streetcar terminus at SW Lowell Street and Moody Avenue after the latter&#x27;s extension in 2007. However, all service on the Willamette Shore line was suspended in July 2010, when the line&#x27;s only streetcar broke down. In early 2013, a lease was secured on a replacement streetcar, a Gomaco-built faux-Vintage Trolley, to enable a resumption of service on the southernmost portion of the line, and that section of the line reopened in August 2014. Service over the northern half of the line, to Bancroft Street in Portland, was restored on July 21, 2017, but has been suspended again since the end of 2019, awaiting trestle repair work, leaving only the line&#x27;s southernmost section in operation for the time being.

==Corridor history==
The right-of-way now used by the Willamette Shore Trolley was established in the mid-1880s by the Portland and Willamette Valley Railway, which began passenger service with steam trains on July 4, 1887. It provided Oswego (as Lake Oswego was known then) with a direct link to Portland. Prior to this, access to Oswego was limited to primitive roads and river boats.

The line was later purchased by the Southern Pacific Company. Southern Pacific widened the line from narrow gauge to standard gauge and electrified it in 1914. This led to its peak in passenger travel in 1920, when 64 &quot;Red Electric&quot; interurban trains traveled daily between the two cities. The line originally ran around Elk Rock – a bend in the river just north of Elk Rock Island – on a long trestle until December 1921, when a tunnel replaced it. The Elk Rock Tunnel is (approx. one-quarter mile) in length and is located in the unincorporated Riverwood area, between Portland and Lake Oswego. On October 5, 1929, passenger service ended, though the line was used for freight until 1983.

==Right-of-way preserved, experimental trolley service==

In August 1984, the Interstate Commerce Commission granted Southern Pacific permission to abandon the line. This prompted several local governments in the area to establish a not-for-profit corporation to acquire the line and preserve the right-of-way for future mass transit. This consortium of governmental entities was initially composed of Metro, TriMet, the cities of Portland and Lake Oswego, and the counties of Multnomah and Clackamas, and it was later joined by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). The line&#x27;s official name at that time was the Jefferson Street Branch, because during the passenger-service era it had served a station called Jefferson Street and continued into downtown Portland via that street.

In January 1987, on behalf of the consortium, the City of Portland secured a lease of the 6.2-mile line from Southern Pacific (SP), including an option to purchase the line. In autumn 1987, a heritage streetcar/trolley service was operated on the line, as a way to gauge public interest in such an operation, in order to help preserve the right-of-way if the plans to purchase the line came to fruition. This temporary, trial heritage trolley service was inaugurated on September 12, 1987, and was operated by the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society (OERHS), using a double-deck trolley originally from Blackpool, England. OERHS named the operation the Willamette Shore Railway, and service ran on weekends and holidays until the end of the year only. As the line lacks overhead trolley wires, the electricity to power the trolley&#x27;s motors was generated by a diesel engine mounted on a cart towed behind (or pushed in front of) the car. The Portland terminus, with a ticket office in a leased trailer, was located next to Moody Avenue, below the west approach viaducts to the Marquam Bridge. The Lake Oswego terminus was located about one-half mile north of downtown.

The consortium purchased the line from Southern Pacific in October 1988, for US$1.9 million, including the cost of a planned extension in Lake Oswego, to be constructed by SP. Metro identified it as a possible transit corridor.

==Regular service, extensions==
Regular, seasonal vintage streetcar service began operation on July 6, 1990, now named the Willamette Shore Trolley. A private company named Gales Creek Enterprises was the operator for the first five seasons, under contract with the City of Lake Oswego. A 1913-built streetcar originally from San Antonio, Texas, was used, with a diesel-powered generator trailer again employed to provide electricity to the streetcar. The ends of the line remained the same as they had been during the 1987 trial service: near the Marquam Bridge in Portland, and near State Street and Terwilliger Boulevard in Lake Oswego.

In 1993, a half-mile of new track was laid in Lake Oswego, permitting extension of the trolley service south to a terminus just south of A Avenue, much closer to the city center. The ticket office was then relocated into a small building owned by Southern Pacific at the new Lake Oswego terminus, and since that time, round-trip excursions have started at the line&#x27;s south end, rather than in Portland. The contract with Gales Creek Enterprises was not renewed when it expired at the end of 1994.
In 1995, the Oregon Electric Railway Historical Society again became the operator of the trolley service, now on a longer-term basis, under contract to Lake Oswego. Trolley operation resumed in August 1995, initially using a former Sydney, Australia open-sided streetcar, but only as a temporary substitute until the intended car could be moved to the line. This was 1928-built Blackpool tram 48, the same double-deck trolley which OERHS had operated on the Willamette Shore line for a few months in fall 1987. The double-decker entered service on November 24, 1995. It was joined in December 1996 by another streetcar in OERHS&#x27;s collection, a 1932 Brill &quot;Master Unit&quot;-type streetcar which had spent its entire working life in Portland, where the cars of that model gained the nickname &quot;Broadway cars&quot;, from the route they first served.

In April 1997, the line was extended from its north end, to the RiverPlace district, increasing its overall length to about . Charlie Hales, then a city commissioner, opined in 1998 that the line had an important future as part of the MAX light rail system. Because of major construction in the then-new South Waterfront district, the new section of track was last used in September 2003, and service was thereafter cut back to a new terminal located immediately south of Bancroft Street. The Blackpool double-decker was taken out of regular use on the Willamette Shore Trolley in late 2003 and was moved in May 2006 to OERHS&#x27;s museum, the Oregon Electric Railway Museum, in Brooks, Oregon. After that, the 1932 Portland Brill streetcar, No. 813, became the only streetcar serving the WST line.

Service is provided on a seasonal basis, rather than year-round, the regular operating season normally lasting from May to October, followed by limited operation on a few dates during the Christmas and holiday season, in December each year.

As a tourist attraction, the line is most popular on the Fourth of July, when the Oaks Amusement Park fireworks display is viewable along the river, and in mid-December, when the area&#x27;s Christmas Ships Parade on the Willamette can be viewed.

==2009 to present==

For most of 2009, all service was suspended, so as to permit work to rehabilitate the line&#x27;s four trestle bridges. The longest of these is Riverwood Trestle, which is long and about high.
Service resumed during the 2009 Christmas and holiday season. The 2010 season began on May 1, but the line&#x27;s only streetcar broke down on July 16, 2010, causing an indefinite suspension of service. This suspension continued in 2011 and 2012, because the estimated cost to repair the car was high, and no substitute streetcar was available. After OERHS determined that repair of the 1932-built streetcar, Portland Brill car 813, would be prohibitively expensive in the foreseeable future, the group began looking for a replacement. Car 813 was moved from Lake Oswego to the Oregon Electric Railway Museum, near Salem, in June 2012.

In early 2013, a lease was secured on a replacement streetcar, and the non-profit group&#x27;s goal was to resume service in summer 2013 on the southernmost part of the line. In October, it was announced that the restarting of service had been postponed to summer 2014. In August 2014, the date for service to resume was set for August 16. The replacement car is a replica of a 1904 Portland &quot;Council Crest&quot;-type Brill streetcar built in 1991 by the Gomaco Trolley Company, for use on the Portland Vintage Trolley service. It is car number 514, and it was moved from TriMet&#x27;s Vintage Trolley carbarn next to the Rose Quarter Transit Center to Lake Oswego on March 26, 2013. One year later, following the discontinuation of Vintage Trolley service in July 2014, a second replica-Council Crest streetcar, car 513, was moved to Lake Oswego on September 8, 2014, and initially was placed into storage, awaiting later restoration.
The line reopened for public rides on August 16, 2014, using car 514. Because of major construction affecting the rail line where it passes through the site of construction of a new Sellwood Bridge (among other issues), it was known that Willamette Shore Trolley service would not be able to run through to Portland for quite some time, until 2016 or 2017. When reopened in 2014, it was running only between Lake Oswego and Riverwood, but one year later, on August 8, 2015, service was extended north to Powers Marine Park (just south of the Sellwood Bridge). This increased the length of line in use to around . The 2016 season began on May 28.

The 2017 season began on May 27, with the service&#x27;s northern terminus still temporarily being at Powers Marine Park, but with the track in the area around the Sellwood Bridge having been reinstated and test runs made. On July 21, 2017, the service was reextended to its pre-2011 Portland terminus, at Bancroft Street, which is one block from the South Waterfront terminus of the Portland Streetcar&#x27;s NS Line.

Car 513 was restored to operating condition, and it entered service on the WST in 2018, on May 26. Prior to this, its last operation with passengers had been on the Portland Streetcar line, more than 12 years earlier.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, service was suspended for the 2020 season and remained suspended in spring 2021, but the line reopened for service on July 3, 2021. Operation is temporarily limited to the southern portion of the line. The same limitation extended to the 2022 season, because of the need for trestle repairs, and the 2023 season, which began on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Trestle repair work is expected to begin in 2023.

==Battery power==
In late January 2019, maintenance crews started removing old DC motor equipment on car 514 as the first stage of a project to convert the streetcar to AC motors and battery propulsion. The new configuration is a collaboration between the WST&#x27;s volunteers and EVDrive Inc, a company based in Hillsboro, Oregon. If successful, this new system will allow operation without the need for a diesel generator. AC motors will allow regenerative braking in the battery, extending the duration of its charge. It is anticipated that the AC motors will be installed in late summer 2019, with the battery pack still in early production at EVDrive. The conversion of car 514 is fully funded, while fundraising is underway to allow car 513 also to be converted to this new system eventually.

==Carbarn==

Since 1998, the Willamette Shore Trolley has had a two-track maintenance building, or carbarn, near the Lake Oswego terminus, where the trolley cars are stored and maintained. Prior to 1998, any trolleys being used on the line had to be stored outdoors, protected with chain-link fencing from vandalism and theft, but not well protected from exposure to the weather. In the mid-1990s, the consortium of governments that own the line secured a federal grant to fund most of the $600,000 cost of building a carbarn in Lake Oswego. Construction began in February 1998, and the facility was completed and dedicated in September 1998.

==Future transit possibilities==

A proposal to convert the line into an extension of the Portland Streetcar, running through Johns Landing and into Lake Oswego, has been studied by Metro, Portland, Lake Oswego and TriMet. Work on an environmental-impact assessment started in spring 2009, considering both the streetcar option and the alternative of &quot;enhanced bus&quot; service, or bus rapid transit (BRT). The streetcar proposal faced opposition from residents of affluent neighborhoods near the tracks, but was preferred by Metro, in part because BRT would likely require giving up one auto lane to buses in some sections to be effective, as the existing roadway, Hwy. 43, is thought likely to be too constricted by topography to enable widening. Planning work on the proposal was indefinitely suspended in early 2012, in light of escalating cost estimates for construction.

<text>The Northern Ontario Party (NOP), called the Northern Ontario Heritage Party (NOHP) until 2016, is a provincial political party in Ontario, Canada. It was formed in 1977 to campaign for provincial status for Northern Ontario. No member has yet been elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

The party&#x27;s founder, Ed Deibel of North Bay, travelled Northern Ontario in the late 1960s and early 1970s to promote the idea of creating a separate province, and to sign up supporters for the party. Prior to launching the party, Deibel had been a business owner and a member of the North Bay City Council.

The party later dropped the idea of a separate province from its platform, and continued to promote Northern Ontario&#x27;s interests within Ontario.

The party disbanded in 1985, and remained inactive until being revived and re-registered by Elections Ontario in 2010. In its initial form, the party did not advocate separation, but campaigned for changes to the region&#x27;s status and political power within the province. The idea of full separation was restored to the party&#x27;s platform in 2016, but dropped again in 2018.

==Origins of the party==
The NOHP had its roots in the April 1973 provincial budget, in which the Government of Ontario proposed to extend the seven per cent provincial sales tax to heating and electricity. Deibel notified the local media that he would go to jail before paying the tax. This led to a meeting of about 500 people, and the formation of a tax repeal committee chaired by Deibel. The committee collected 24,000 signatures from all over Northern Ontario on a petition, and the government ultimately withdrew the proposal.

On May 16, 1973, Deibel formed a committee to discuss this idea, and began research about Northern Ontario’s problems. Deibel travelled Northern Ontario recruiting 600 members for the new province committee, and obtaining 6,000 signatures on a petition requesting that a vote be given to Northern Ontario on the question of forming a new province.

In October 1974, Deibel pitched a tent at Queen&#x27;s Park, site of Ontario’s legislative assembly, for three days, and gave interviews to the media. This led to a half-hour private meeting with Premier William Davis, who refused to allow a plebiscite. 

In the spring of 1975, Deibel wrote to Premier Davis, offering to abandon the new province committee if the government met seven demands:

# Establish a Northern Ontario Development Commission with citizens from Northern Ontario.
# A program paid for by the province to eliminate municipal taxes for ten years for all new manufacturing plants that complete at least 80 per cent of finished form.
# Non-renewable resources to have a depletion tax deposited in a trust fund designed for that area when the project in finished.
# At least 50 per cent of all natural resources to be processed and manufactured in Northern Ontario.
# A billion-dollar catch-up program to provide serviced land for housing industrial parks and social needs.
# Appointment of a provincial cabinet minister with full responsibility for mining.
# Lakehead University and Laurentian University would receive funding for a continuing program of research and development that assures a better quality of life in Northern Ontario.

The Ontario government responded to the offer, noting that &quot;Northern Ontario... is strengthened by being an integral part of a very broadly based provincial economy.&quot; The government’s response addressed each of the demands, but accepted none of them.

Deibel replied with a demand for the Premier’s resignation, and on September 17, 1976, began to collect the 10,000 signatures necessary to register a new political party. The provincial government subsequently created the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines in 1977. The Northern Ontario Heritage Party was given official certification in October 1977, with 10,600 signatures.

==Activity==
In 1979, Deibel created some controversy when he claimed that Ontario Progressive Conservative Party cabinet minister Alan Pope had pledged to cross the floor and join the party as its first MPP. Pope denied the claim and never crossed; according to Pope, while he lauded the party&#x27;s goal of improving Northern Ontario&#x27;s economic standing, he felt that he could accomplish more by working within the government than by sitting with a minor party.

Soon afterward, Deibel attempted to run for a nomination as a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the 1980 federal election. Perceived as having damaged his and the party&#x27;s credibility, he was forced to resign his position and was succeeded as leader by Garry Lewis, a businessman from Callander who dropped separation from the party&#x27;s agenda and instead campaigned for economic development of the region within the province.

Despite the more than 10,000 people who had signed the party&#x27;s original certification documents, however, the party had no more than 200 paying members at its peak.

In early 1983, the party membership ousted Lewis and its executive. The party&#x27;s new leader, Ronald Gilson, promptly reinstated separation from Ontario as the party&#x27;s primary goal. By 1985, however, the party was deregistered after failing to file its annual contributions and expenses return for 1984; Don Joynt, the executive director of the provincial Commission on Election Contributions and Expenses, revealed that in its year-end return for 1983, the party had listed just ninety cents in assets and only four card-carrying members.

==2010 revival==
In 2010, Deibel began trying to revive the party, setting up a website where Northerners were invited to join the party. On August 6, 2010, the party was registered by Elections Ontario.

In its initial platform, the revived Northern Ontario Heritage Party called for a number of measures to increase the region&#x27;s power over its own affairs within the province, including increasing the number of Northern Ontario electoral districts in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the creation of a special district for the region&#x27;s First Nations voters.

The party ran three candidates in the 2011 provincial election, garnering 683 votes. However, one of its candidates ran in the downtown Toronto riding of St. Paul&#x27;s rather than in a Northern Ontario riding.

In the 2014 provincial election, the party received 892 votes with three candidates. Deibel ran as the party&#x27;s candidate in Thunder Bay—Atikokan.

In 2016, the party changed its name to &quot;Northern Ontario Party&quot;, by registering the name change with Elections Ontario as per regulations, and announced Trevor Holliday as its new leader. Holliday, previously a bus driver for Ontario Northland, was converted to Northern Ontario separation when the government of Dalton McGuinty announced plans in 2012 to shut down the service, and attracted media attention early in 2016 when he created an online petition on change.org which eventually attracted over 4,000 signatories. Deibel remained involved in the party executive. Under Holliday&#x27;s leadership, the party restored separation from Ontario to its platform.

In 2017, the party called for the creation of a separate Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry for Northern Ontario as an interim step during the period of secession negotiations, as well as calling for a referendum to revise the province&#x27;s school board structure.

In the 2018 Ontario general election, the party again dropped separation from Ontario from its campaign platform, and returned to advocating for measures to improve the region&#x27;s standing within the province, such as the creation of special Northern Ontario-only government ministries.

In April 2019, Trevor Holliday resigned as leader of the Northern Ontario Party, in order &quot;to ensure we have a leader that can communicate with the supporters, members, media and most importantly Northerners, in more than just English.&quot; He was succeeded as leader by Shawn Poirier, a truck driver from Kirkland Lake who had been the party&#x27;s candidate in Timiskaming—Cochrane in 2018. Poirier stepped down as leader a few months later, citing personal reasons, and Holliday reassumed the leadership on an interim basis.

In 2021, Holliday backed the idea of a Northern Ontario travel bubble during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, allowing free movement within Northern Ontario but restricting entry from outside the region. The party failed to win any seats in the 2022 Ontario general election.

<text>MTU Aero Engines AG is a German aircraft engine manufacturer. MTU develops, manufactures and provides service support for military and civil aircraft engines. MTU Aero Engines was formerly known as MTU München.

==History==
While the Munich-based engine manufacturer Rapp Motorenwerke, and subsequently BMW, had produced aircraft engines since 1913, the modern company regards the formal date of its formation as being 1934, the year in which &quot;BMW Flugmotorenbau GmbH&quot; was spun-off from BMW. This step was initiated by the Ministry of Aviation in order to disguise the planned rearmament of the Luftwaffe – as a standalone limited company the &quot;Flugmotorenbau GmbH&quot; had less strict disclosure requirements. Additionally, BMW aimed at outsourcing the unforeseeable risk of contributing to the German rearmament. In 1936, BMW built an aircraft engine plant in Allach near Munich, which are the headquarters of MTU Aero Engines today. In 1940, the plant was expanded significantly to start large-scale production of BMW 801 aircraft engines, which powered the Focke-Wulfe FW 190 fighter aircraft and Dornier Do 217 bomber aircraft.

Following the conclusion of the conflict in May 1945, American troops occupied the factory grounds in Allach, after which aircraft engine production was halted for ten years. During these years, the factory served as a U.S. Army vehicle and artillery repair shop.

===1950s===
On 22 January 1954, BMW formally re-commenced aircraft engine development. Three years later, after the ban on engine production was lifted in Germany, the company was able to restart aero engine production at Allach, initially focusing upon the licensed production of foreign-sourced, typically American, aero engines. By 1959, &quot;BMW Triebwerkbau GmbH&quot; was engaged in the production under licence of the General Electric J79-11A turbojet engine for the German Air Force&#x27;s Lockheed F-104 Starfighter fleet.

===1960s===
During the 1960s, the Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engine was also being manufactured via a licensing arrangement, it was used as the powerplant for multiple Luftwaffe aircraft, such as the Breguet Atlantic, a maritime patrol aircraft, and the C-160 Transall, a utility transport aircraft. In addition to licensing other firm&#x27;s aero engine designs, the company was keen to branch out into the development of new engines via the formation of risk-sharing partnerships with other European manufacturers.

In autumn 1968, MAN Turbo GmbH and Daimler-Benz formed a new joint venture, initially known as &quot;Entwicklungsgesellschaft für Turbomotoren GmbH&quot;, which combined their aircraft engine development and manufacturing interests. In July 1969, this joint venture was superseded by &quot;Motoren- und Turbinen-Union GmbH&quot; (MTU), which took over the aircraft engine and high-speed diesel engine activities of both MAN Turbo and Daimler-Benz. &quot;MTU München&quot; was responsible for aircraft engines, while MTU Friedrichshafen was responsible for diesel engines and other gas turbines.

On 14 October 1969, BMW formalised its cooperation with both the British aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce and the Italian aerospace company FiatAvio through the foundation of Turbo-Union; this entity was established as a joint venture to develop and manufacture the Turbo-Union RB199, a military-grade turbofan engine that was primarily produced to power the Panavia Tornado, a swing-wing multirole combat aircraft adopted by various European nations, including Germany. BMW held a 40 per cent stake in the ownership of Turbo-Union, while Rolls-Royce held another 40 per cent with the remainder owned by FiatAvio; workshare for the production of the RB199 itself was also divided along a similar ratio.

===1980s===
During 1985, Daimler-Benz acquired MAN&#x27;s 50% share in the company, after which MTU was placed under its aerospace subsidiary, DASA.

In 1986, EuroJet Turbo GmbH was founded to manage the development, production, support, maintenance, support and sales of the EJ200 turbofan engine for the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter. At the time of its establishment, the original partners in Eurojet GmbH were Rolls-Royce, MTU, Fiat and Sener. The EJ200 engine combined the leading technologies from each of the four European companies, using advanced digital control and health monitoring; wide chord aerofoils and single crystal turbine blades; and a convergent / divergent exhaust nozzle to give excellent thrust-to-weight ratio, multimission capability, supercruise performance, low fuel consumption, low cost of ownership, modular construction and significant growth potential. By late 2006, Eurojet had been contracted to produce a total of 1,400 engines for the Eurofighter.

During June 1989, another joint venture, MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce (MTR) was established as a part of the framework created on behalf of the French and West German governments to developed an advanced multirole battlefield helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger. MTR&#x27;s role in the programme was to develop and manufacture the MTR390 powerplant that powers the Tiger. While it operates as the programme management company responsible for the engine, it is jointly staffed by the partner companies, these being MTU, France&#x27;s Turbomeca and Rolls-Royce. The initial workshare was divided as follows: Turbomeca produced the compressor, gearbox, accessories and control system, Rolls-Royce manufactured the power turbine stage, while MTU was responsible for the combustor, high-pressure turbine, along with the final assembly of the entire first batch of engines. During early 2000, an initial production contract was signed by the German Federal Office of Defence Technology and Procurement (BWB) and MTR; valued at DM430 million and comprising 320 engines plus spares, the contract represented the MTU390&#x27;s clearance for production.

===2000s===

During 2000 DASA was merged with several other European companies to form the European Aeronautics and Defense Systems (EADS) multinational conglomerate, MTU was split off and remained a part of DaimlerChrysler. Three years later, MTU was sold to the private equity firm KKR. During 2005, KKR opted to sell all of its shares in the firm on the stock exchange.

In 2002, the Europrop International (EPI) consortium was set up by four aero engine manufacturers, MTU, France&#x27;s Safran Aircraft Engines, Rolls-Royce and Spain&#x27;s Industria de Turbo Propulsores. EPI GmbH is tasked with designing, developing, marketing, manufacturing and providing support for the TP400-D6 turboprop engine to power the Airbus A400M Atlas, a military airlifter manufactured by Airbus Defence &amp; Space. The TP400 is the most powerful turboprop in the world currently in production.

===2010s===
In 2019, MTU announced that Serbia would be a centre for aircraft engine repairs, after MTU Aero Engines signed a memorandum of understanding with Serbia&#x27;s Economy Ministry; a new facility shall be established in the northern town of Stara Pazova, near to Belgrade. The company possesses numerous other locations around the globe, including Rocky Hill, Connecticut; Vancouver, British Columbia; Rzeszów, Poland; Zhu Hai, China and Dallas, Texas.

During December 2019, Safran and MTU announced an agreement to found a 50/50 joint venture to manage the development, production, and after-sales support activities of the new military aero engine intended to power the Future Combat Air System.

===2020s===
In 2021, MTU Maintenance Canada Ltd, MTU&#x27;s primary MRO facility in North America, moved into a larger facility, consolidating work under one roof while also providing additional space for future growth.

<text>The Unparty emerged as a political party in Ontario, Canada during the early 1980s. It was established by former members of the Ontario Libertarian Party, namely Lisa Butler, Mary Lou Gutscher (former OLP chair), Bill McDonald, and Paul Wakfer (former president of the Libertarian Party of Canada).

These individuals held fundamental disagreements with their previous party and decided to form the Unparty. One of the key motivations behind its formation was their evolution towards market anarchism in their libertarian beliefs, leading them to advocate for the abolition of state offices.

As a result, the Unparty&#x27;s core focus was centered around candidates elected under its banner refusing their salaries and actively voting against any legislation aimed at expanding or sustaining the state.

Headquartered in Toronto, the Unparty successfully obtained the necessary voter signatures to register in Ontario and Alberta, as well as qualify as a provincial party in New Brunswick. The party gained significant attention through successful public campaigns that garnered national news coverage. Notable examples included protests against the census and high-profile resistance to the government&#x27;s forced demolition of a privately owned home, which the Unparty believed was an unjust action despite its legality.

Unlike traditional political parties, the Unparty adopted an organizational structure resembling a partnership rather than a democracy. The founding principle rested on the notion that members were considered customers, whose continued support depended on the progress made by the party&#x27;s leadership. The executive team, with input from the members, was responsible for delivering value to ensure ongoing support. This organizational approach, combined with the Unparty&#x27;s official registration status in Ontario, appealed to the leaders of the Unparty&#x27;s London Constituency Associations, which had been the most active and visible groups within the Unparty outside of its headquarters.

The Unparty founders retired in 1983 and leaders of the London Constituency Association took over the running of the party under a new name and a revised Statement of Purpose as the Freedom Party of Ontario.

<doc id="574453" wikidata="Q1193187" url="?curid=574453" title="Ron Brown">
<text>Ronald Harmon Brown (August 1, 1941 – April 3, 1996) was an American politician. He served as the United States Secretary of Commerce during the first term of President Bill Clinton. Before this, he was chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). He was the first African American to hold these positions. He was killed, along with 34 others, in a 1996 plane crash in Croatia.

==Early life==
Ron Brown was born in Washington, D.C., and was raised in Harlem, New York, in a middle-class family. He was a member of an African-American social and philanthropic organization, Jack and Jill of America. Brown attended Hunter College Elementary School and Rhodes Preparatory School. His father managed the Theresa Hotel in Harlem, where Brown and his family lived. His best friend, John R. Nailor, moved into the penthouse while he was a student at Rhodes. Nailor was one of the other few black students who attended Rhodes Prep. As a child, Brown appeared in an advertisement for Pepsi-Cola (renamed to Pepsi in 1961), one of the first to be targeted specifically towards the African-American community.

== Military career ==

While at Middlebury College, Ron Brown became the first African-American member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, collegiate fraternity. Brown was commissioned through the ROTC program as a 2nd Lieutenant of Armor in the United States Army in 1962 after graduating from Middlebury, the same year he married Alma Arrington. After tours of duty in Germany and California, deploying temporarily to Korea, he left the United States Army as a Captain in 1967. Brown then joined the National Urban League, a leading economic equality group in the United States. Meanwhile, Brown enrolled at St. John&#x27;s University School of Law and obtained a degree in 1970.

==Rise in the Democratic Party==

By 1976, Brown had been promoted to Deputy Executive Director for Programs and Governmental Affairs of the National Urban League. However, he resigned in 1979 to work as a deputy campaign manager for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s presidential nomination.

Brown was hired in 1981 by the Washington, D.C., law firm Patton Boggs as a lawyer and a lobbyist.

In May 1988, Brown was named by Jesse L. Jackson to head Jackson&#x27;s convention team at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. Brown and several other experienced party insiders were named to Jackson&#x27;s convention operation. By June, it was apparent that Brown was also running Jackson&#x27;s campaign.

==Democratic National Committee==
In 1982, Brown was named deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee. That same year, he began lobbying the U.S. government on behalf of the brutal Duvalier regime, which was then in power in Haiti. Over the next four years, Brown earned $630,000, helping to persuade the Administration to continue aid to the government of dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier. Brown refused to drop the Duvaliers despite being criticized for representing such unsavory clients.

Brown was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee on February 10, 1989, becoming the first African American chosen to lead a major U.S. political party. He later played an integral role in running a successful 1992 Democratic National Convention and in Bill Clinton&#x27;s successful 1992 presidential run.
==Secretary of Commerce==

President Clinton then appointed Brown to the position of Secretary of Commerce in 1993. Clinton&#x27;s highest priority was bolstering the economy, not diplomacy, and Brown produced results. He led delegations of entrepreneurs, business people, and financiers to South Africa, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Egypt, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Ireland, India, and Senegal. He was leading a trade mission en route to Croatia when all the passengers died in a plane crash.

Brown was involved in the Commerce Department trade mission controversy during his tenure.

==Criticism==
During the Nannygate scandal, Brown admitted that he had failed to pay taxes for his maid, who was an illegal immigrant.

In 1996, before Brown&#x27;s trade mission, he sold seats on the plane used for the mission to raise funds for Bill Clinton&#x27;s reelection campaign.

In 1993, Brown was alleged to have accepted $700,000 from Vietnamese businessman Nguyen Van Hao so that Brown would lift the embargo against Vietnam.

==Death==
On April 3, 1996, when Brown was on an official trade mission, a U.S. Air Force CT-43 (a modified Boeing 737) carrying Brown and 34 other people, including &quot;New York Times&quot; Frankfurt Bureau chief Nathaniel C. Nash, crashed into a mountainside on approach to Croatia&#x27;s Dubrovnik Airport. The Air Force attributed the crash to pilot error and a poorly designed landing approach. Speculation about the crash included many government cover-up and conspiracy theories, largely based on Brown having been under investigation by independent counsel for corruption. Of specific concern was a trip Brown had made to Vietnam on behalf of the Clinton Administration. Brown carried an offer for normalizing relations between the United States and the former communist enemy.

Some people, including Kweisi Mfume—head of the NAACP at the time—and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, had written federal officials to ask for more data on the suspicious circumstances of Brown&#x27;s death. &quot;Responding to homicide allegations, an official of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology acknowledged that doctors initially were puzzled by a circular wound on the top of Brown&#x27;s head when his remains were recovered at the crash scene. The forensic pathologist then consulted with others and took extensive X-rays. As a result of these consultations and full-body X-rays, we absolutely ruled out anything beyond a blunt-force injury to the head.&quot;

Brown was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Honors and legacy==

On April 5, 1996, President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton planted a white dogwood tree on a hill on the South Lawn in memory of Brown and the others killed in the aircrash. On January 8, 2001, Brown was presented, posthumously, with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton, twelve days before George W. Bush took office. The award was accepted by Brown&#x27;s widow, Alma Brown. President Clinton also established the Ron Brown Award for corporate leadership and responsibility. The Conference Board administers the privately funded award. The U.S. Department of Commerce also gives out the annual Ronald H. Brown American Innovator Award in his honor.

Many academic scholarships and programs have been established to honor Brown. St. John&#x27;s University School of Law established the Ronald H. Brown Center for Civil Rights and Economic Development in memorial. The Ronald H. Brown fellowship is awarded annually to many students at Middlebury College to pursue research internships in science and technology. The Ron Brown Scholar Program was established in Brown&#x27;s honor in 1996 to provide academic scholarships, service opportunities, and leadership experiences for young African Americans of outstanding promise.

A memorial room has been installed in the Ronald Brown memorial house in the old city of Dubrovnik. It features portraits of the crash victims as well as a guest book.

The largest ship in the NOAA fleet, the NOAA Ship &quot;Ronald H. Brown&quot;, was named in honor of his public service not long after his death. The section of 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenue was renamed Ron Brown Way in March 2011.

In March 2011, the new United States Mission to the United Nations building in New York City was named in Brown&#x27;s honor and dedicated at a ceremony in which President Obama, former President Clinton, and the United States representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Susan Rice, spoke.

In 1997, Daniel C. Roper Middle School in Washington, DC, was renamed Ronald H. Brown Middle School in his honor. That school was closed in 2013, and the building reopened as Ronald Brown College Preparatory High School in 2016.

His son Michael Brown was elected to the Council of the District of Columbia in 2008. He lost his reelection campaign in 2012 and later pleaded guilty to the charge of accepting a bribe from undercover agents. He was sentenced to 39 months in prison.

<doc id="574456" wikidata="Q659951" url="?curid=574456" title="Alexander McDougall">
<text>Alexander McDougall (1732 9 June 1786) was a Scottish-born American seaman, merchant, a Sons of Liberty leader from New York City before and during the American Revolution, and a military leader during the Revolutionary War. He served as a major general in the Continental Army, and as a delegate to the Continental Congress. After the war, he was the president of the first bank in the state of New York and served a term in the New York State Senate.

==Early life==
McDougall was born on the Isle of Islay, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland in the summer of 1732. He was one of the five children of Ranald and Elizabeth McDougall. In 1738 the family emigrated to New York as part of a party led by a British Army veteran, Captain Lachlan Campbell. Campbell had described fertile land available near Fort Edward, but when they arrived in New York City, they discovered that Lachlan had been awarded a patent for about and expected them to become tenants to his estate. Ranald withdrew and found work on a dairy farm on the island of Manhattan. The family prospered and young Alexander began his commercial career as a delivery boy for milk in New York.

In around 1745, when he was fourteen, Alexander signed on as a merchant seaman. He worked on a number of vessels, and then in 1751 he returned to Great Britain for 4 months.

==Privateer to merchant==
After the onset of the French and Indian War in 1756, McDougall became commissioned by the crown as a merchant privateer. During the war, McDougall commanded two ships; the &quot;Tyger&quot;, an 8 gun sloop, and the &quot;Barrington&quot;, a 12 gun sloop. An able captain as well as a knowledgeable merchant, he made a modest fortune in captured ships and the sale of their cargo.

In 1763 McDougall gave up the seafaring life. The war had ended, his wife Nancy died, as did his father. He was left with responsibility for his three children and his mother. So he converted his seagoing assets and with the small fortune he had accumulated during the war, invested in land and became a merchant and importer. During this period, McDougall also worked as a slave trader and owned at least one slave named Colerain. By 1767 he had his affairs in good order. He owned land in Albany County and as far away as North Carolina. He remarried, this time to Hannah Bostwick, the daughter of his landlady. Though their increasing wealth earned them recognition, it did not earn them acceptance into the traditional society in New York City. Longstanding members of high society such as the Livingstons and the De Lancey&#x27;s looked down on him as crude and unpolished.

==Prelude to revolution==
When revolutionary fervor grew with resistance to the Stamp Act, McDougall became active in the Sons of Liberty, and later was a leader in the movement in the colony of New York. Difficulties in the city and colony were increased by the Quartering Act, which required the colonists to provide housing and support to the British troops. The Province of New York assembly had refused to pass appropriations for their housing in 1767 and 1768, and had been prorogued. Then, the new assembly of 1769 approved money for the quartering of British troops. On 16 December 1769 McDougall wrote and printed an anonymous broadside, &quot;To the Betrayed Inhabitants&quot;, which criticized the assembly&#x27;s vote and sparked the Battle of Golden Hill. He was accused of libel and arrested on 7 February 1770, but refused to post bail, so he was jailed. He spent two periods in jail, for a total of about five months, but wasn&#x27;t convicted and was released in 1771. His imprisonment became another cause for protest. In an effort to paint him as a political martyr, the Sons of Liberty called him, &quot;the Wilkes of America,&quot; after John Wilkes, a British politician who was imprisoned for defying the authority of the government. This was symbolized by the group and was incorporated into the protests.

McDougall became the street leader of the Sons of Liberty, and organized continued protests until the city became under de facto control of the Patriots in 1775. He organized the city&#x27;s reaction to the Tea Tax in 1773 and led their action, similar to the Boston Tea Party. He became a member of the Committees of Correspondence and Safety, the New York City Committee of Sixty and when New York established their revolutionary government in 1775, he was elected to the New York Provincial Congress. It was during this prelude to the Revolution that McDougall became close friends with Alexander Hamilton.

==Continental Army==

On 30 June 1775, McDougall became a commissioned colonel of the 1st New York Regiment by an act of the New York Provincial Congress. Eventually, McDougall would rise the rank of Major General in the Continental Army. Soon after his commission, McDougall&#x27;s troops were sent north to take part in the invasion of Quebec (1775), among them were two of McDougall&#x27;s sons. The Colonel stayed behind to raise funds and troops. The campaign ultimately failed. One of McDougall&#x27;s sons was captured and the other died of a fever near Montreal.

During the early period of the war, McDougall played a role, in collaboration with Peter T. Curtenius, in preparing for the siege of New York by the Regulars.

The city was unprepared for an extended fight and the defense of the city was a primary focus for George Washington and his staff. When the Regulars won the Battle of Long Island, it quickly became apparent that the Continental Army would be unable to hold the city. The Continental Army needed to make a quick retreat from the city in order to avoid heavy losses. Colonel McDougall helped oversee the evacuation effort by boat.

After the Continental Army left New York City, they traveled north and made an initial stand against the British near the village of White Plains. Here, McDougall helped to hold off the British and allow for the main body of the army to avoid conflict. For much of the remainder of the war, McDougall was stationed in the Highlands of the Hudson as the commander of American forces at West Point, New York (Fort Clinton) after Benedict Arnold&#x27;s defection in 1780. Throughout the war, McDougall was an outspoken advocate for the Continental Army and for better conditions for its soldiers. In the winter of 1783 he was at the head of the committee of army officers who the bore complaints about pay from Newburgh to Congress.

McDougall was also involved in the establishment of an American navy in 1776.

==Public service==

In 1780, he was elected as delegate to the Continental Congress. He spent only 37 days in Congress, however, he was soon nominated to serve as the Secretary of Marine. He served in that role from 7 February 1781 – 29 August 1781. In 1784, he was elected to the State Senate where he served until his death. In his role as State Senator, McDougall was involved in the successful movement to separate church and state in the New York State government and the unsuccessful movement to not issue paper money. McDougall was the first president of the Bank of New York as well as the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

He died 9 June 1786, at the age of fifty-three and was interred in the family vault in the First Presbyterian Church, New York City. Today, his memorial stone is situated prominently on the wall of the First Presbyterian Church of New York in Greenwich Village.

==Legacy==
MacDougal Street in the New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village is named for him.

== Personal life ==
McDougall married his cousin, Nancy McDougall, during a trip to Great Britain in 1751. After the Revolution, she died and McDougall remarried his landlady&#x27;s daughter, Hannah Bostwick. During the war, one of his sons died and another was captured by the British. McDougall was well liked and respected by the soldiers he commanded. He continuously advocated for better wages and conditions for soldiers. He was also close friends with Alexander Hamilton and was deeply respected by George Washington, who called him a &quot;pillar of the revolution.&quot; McDougall may have been born in Scotland, but he was rebellious and stubborn by nature and deeply loyal to his adopted home of America.

McDougall&#x27;s great-grandson John McDougall Atherton was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, as was Atherton&#x27;s own son, Peter Lee Atherton.

<text>The Portland and Willamette Valley Railway was incorporated on 19 January 1885 to continue construction of a narrow-gauge railroad line between Portland and Dundee, Oregon, United States, which had been started a few years earlier by the Oregonian Railway. The line was opened on 31 December 1886 and the first timetables were published the following day; however, the line did not reach Portland until 23 July 1888, due to disputes over the right-of-way. The railroad company ran this line until it fell into receivership on 2 February 1892.

On 5 August 1892, the line was leased to a Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, the Portland and Yamhill Railroad, which ran the narrow-gauge line for another year. The railroad was later taken over entirely by the Oregon and California Railroad, another Southern Pacific Railroad subsidiary, on 1 August 1893 and was converted to that same year.

The Portland and Willamette Valley Railway&#x27;s main line became the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Newberg branch. The Willamette Shore Trolley runs on a part of that Dundee–Portland line, between Lake Oswego and Portland. The Portland and Western Railroad operates freight service south of Lake Oswego.

<doc id="574463" wikidata="Q889407" url="?curid=574463" title="Bodega Harbor">
<text>Bodega Harbor is a small, shallow, natural harbor on the Pacific coast of northern California in the United States, approximately northwest of San Francisco. The harbor is approximately in area.

The harbor is in Sonoma County at , on the eastern side of Bodega Head and is protected from the main part of Bodega Bay to the south by a narrow sandy spit of land. The village of Bodega Bay sits along the eastern side of the harbor. Geologically, the harbor is formed by a depression of the San Andreas Fault.

Southwest of Bodega Harbor is the University of California&#x27;s Bodega Marine Reserve on Horseshoe Cove. Bodega Harbor is a good location for access to Cordell Bank, Tomales Bay, and the Farallon Islands. The University of California maintains a marine biology study in the mud flats, along the southwestern corner of the harbor. Bodega Harbor is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy.

==History==
Campbell Cove near the entrance of the harbor from Bodega Bay is sometimes mentioned as a possible landing site of Francis Drake on the coast of North America in 1579. The site is not, however, considered to be a likely candidate by most historians. &quot;See:&quot; Drakes Estero, Bolinas Lagoon

The harbor was used from 1811 to the 1840s by the Russian-American Company colony at Fort Ross.

The harbor and the town were the primary location used by Alfred Hitchcock for his 1962 movie &quot;The Birds&quot;. Several scenes were shot using watercraft on the harbor.

The coastal freighter &quot;Marin&quot; was built at Antioch, California in 1928. When no longer useful for coastal trade, &quot;Marin&quot; was anchored in Bodega Harbor as a floating warehouse for local fishermen until a storm blew her ashore on the northern end of the harbor. A plan by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric to build a nuclear power plant on Bodega Head included building a road to the proposed construction site, and that road passed seaward of the grounded freighter. The power plant project was abandoned in 1964 but the road remained and &quot;Marin&quot; gradually collapsed into the surrounding trees.

==Current use==
The natural harbor hosts two marinas, a boat launch, two fishing ports, campground and several waterfront restaurants. However, the primary recreational use is windsurfing and kitesurfing. The inner harbor is shallow, from no water at low tide to at high tide, and provides an ideal place to learn and improve.

<text>Niels Wilhelm Gade (22 February 1817 – 21 December 1890) was a Danish composer, conductor, violinist, organist and teacher. Together with Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, he was the leading Danish musician of his day, in the period known as the Danish Golden Age.

==Biography==
Gade was born in Copenhagen, the son of a joiner and instrument maker. He was intended for his father&#x27;s trade, but his passion for a musician&#x27;s career, made evident by the ease and skill with which he learned to play upon a number of instruments, was not to be denied. Though he became proficient on the violin under Frederik Wexschall, and in the elements of theory under Christoph Weyse and Weyse&#x27;s pupil Andreas Berggreen, he was to a great extent self-taught.

He began his professional career as a violinist with the Royal Danish Orchestra, which premiered his concert overture &quot;Efterklange af Ossian&quot; (&quot;Echoes of Ossian&quot;) in 1841. When the performance of his first symphony had to be delayed in Copenhagen, it was sent to Felix Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn received the work positively, and conducted it in Leipzig in March 1843, to enthusiastic public reaction. His work attracted the notice of the king, who gave the composer a Danish government fellowship which enabled him to go to Leipzig and Italy. Moving to Leipzig, Gade taught at the Conservatory there, working as an assistant conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra, and befriending Mendelssohn, who had an important influence on his music.

In 1845 Gade conducted the premiere of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor with Ferdinand David at the violin. He also became friends with Robert Schumann and Robert Franz. Robert Schumann wrote a long enthusiastic article describing Gade as an exceptional young musician having the looks of Mozart and the four letters of whose name were those of the four strings of the violin. In his correspondence he talks of Gade as a rare talent with whom he sympathises as only with few. One of Schumann&#x27;s piano pieces is entitled &quot;Gade&quot; and based on the notes G-A-D-E, and Schumann&#x27;s third piano trio is dedicated to Gade. Gade conducted the first performance of Schumann&#x27;s piano Concerto with Clara Schumann at the piano.

At Mendelssohn&#x27;sdeath in 1847, Gade was appointed to his position as chief conductor in Leipzig but was forced to return to Copenhagen in the spring of 1848 when war broke out between Prussia and Denmark. In Copenhagen Gade became acquainted with the composer Cornelius Gurlitt and they remained friends until Gade&#x27;s death. Gade became director of the Copenhagen Musical Society (&quot;Musikforeningen&quot;), a post he retained until his death. He established a new orchestra and chorus, while settling into a career as Denmark&#x27;s most prominent musician. Under his direction, the Music Society reached its peak. He also worked as an organist; though he lost the prestigious position of organist at Our Lady, today&#x27;s Copenhagen Cathedral, to Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann, he served in the Holmen Church in Copenhagen from 1850 until his death. Gade was joint director of the Copenhagen Conservatory with Hartmann (whose daughter he married in 1852) and Holger Simon Paulli, became court conductor in 1861, and was pensioned by the government in 1876. An important influence on a number of Scandinavian composers, he encouraged and taught Edvard Grieg, Carl Nielsen, Louis Glass, Elfrida Andrée, Otto Malling, August Winding and Asger Hamerik.

Among Gade&#x27;s works are eight symphonies, a violin concerto, chamber music, organ and piano pieces and a number of large-scale cantatas, &quot;Comala&quot; (1846) and &quot;Elverskud&quot; (1853) among them, which he called &quot;concert pieces&quot; (&quot;koncertstykker&quot;). These products, embraced post-1848 as works of Romantic nationalism, are sometimes based on Danish folklore. Apparently Gade never rated &quot;The Bridal Waltz&quot; (&quot;Brudevalsen&quot;). It was rescued by August Bournonville in his ballet A Folk Tale (&quot;Et folkesagn&quot;) and became an essential part of Danish weddings.

==Personal life==
On 27 April 1852 Gade married Emma Sophie Amalie Hartmann, daughter of Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann. He dedicated his Spring Fantasy to her to celebrate their engagement and his 5th Symphony with piano concertante as a wedding gift. In 1855, she died in childbirth while delivering twins; only one of them, Johan Felix Gade (1855-1928), survived. He became the father of organist and composer Niels Rudolph Gade.

Niels Gade remarried in 1857 to Mathilde Stæger, herself an outstanding pianist. For the wedding he wrote Fruehlingsbotschfaft expressing both his love for his now deceased first wife and the start of a new life and love for his second wife. This new marriage brought him two more children – a son, Axel Wilhelm Gade (1860-1921), who himself became a noted violinist, composer and conductor, and a daughter, Dagmar Gade (1863-1952). Niels Gade died in Copenhagen in the Christmas days of 1890.

There is no family connection with the composer Jacob Gade.

A selection of Gade&#x27;s correspondance with European contemporaries was published by Inger Sørensen as &quot;Niels W. Gade og hans europæiske kreds - En brevveksling 1836–1891&quot;.

<text>Carl Djerassi (October 29, 1923 – January 30, 2015) was an Austrian-born Bulgarian-American pharmaceutical chemist, novelist, playwright and co-founder of Djerassi Resident Artists Program with Diane Wood Middlebrook. He is best known for his contribution to the development of oral contraceptive pills, nicknamed the &quot;father of the pill&quot;.

==Early life==
Carl Djerassi was born in Vienna, Austria, but spent the first years of his infancy in Sofia, Bulgaria, the home of his father, Samuel Djerassi, a dermatologist and specialist in sexually transmitted diseases. His mother was Alice Friedmann, a Viennese dentist and physician. Both parents were Jewish.

Following his parents&#x27; divorce, Djerassi and his mother moved to Vienna. Until the age of 14, he attended the same &quot;realgymnasium&quot; that Sigmund Freud had attended many years earlier; spending summers in Bulgaria with his father.

Austria refused him citizenship and after the Anschluss, his father briefly remarried his mother in 1938 to allow Carl and his mother to escape the Nazi regime and flee to Sofia, Bulgaria, where he lived with his father for a year. Bulgaria, although not immune to antisemitism, proved a safe haven, as the country managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population from deportation to Nazi concentration camps. During his time in Sofia, Djerassi attended the American College of Sofia where he became fluent in English.

In December 1939, Djerassi arrived with his mother in the United States, nearly penniless. Djerassi&#x27;s mother worked in a group practice in upstate New York. In 1949, his father emigrated to the United States, practiced in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and eventually retired near his son in San Francisco, California.

==Education==
Djerassi started his college career at Newark Junior College after moving to the United States with his mother when he was 16. He previously had attended the American College of Sofia, a high school in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he became fluent in English. Because of the name of his high school, he was misunderstood and enrolled into Newark Junior College before graduating high school. After a year at Newark Junior College, Djerassi wrote a letter to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt asking for help with a room and board and tuition scholarship to a four-year college. He received a response from the Institute of International Education with a full scholarship to Tarkio College where he briefly attended, and then studied chemistry at Kenyon College, where he graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. After one year at CIBA, he moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he earned his PhD in organic chemistry in 1945. His thesis work examined the transformation of the male sex hormone testosterone into the female sex hormone estradiol, through a sequence of chemical reactions.

==Career==
In 1942/43, Djerassi worked for CIBA in New Jersey, developing Pyribenzamine (tripelennamine), his first patent and one of the first commercial antihistamines.

In 1949 Djerassi became associate director of research at Syntex in Mexico City and remained there through 1951. He has said that one factor influencing him to choose Syntex was that they had a DU spectrophotometer. He worked on a new synthesis of cortisone based on diosgenin, a steroid sapogenin derived from a Mexican wild yam. His team later synthesized norethisterone (norethindrone), the first highly active progestin analogue that was effective when taken by mouth. This became part of one of the first successful combined oral contraceptive pills, known colloquially as the birth-control pill, or simply, the Pill. From 1952 to 1959 he was professor of chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit.

Djerassi participated in the invention in 1951, together with Mexican Luis E. Miramontes and Hungarian-Mexican George Rosenkranz, of the progestin norethisterone—which, unlike progesterone, remained effective when taken orally and was far stronger than the naturally occurring hormone. His preparation was first administered as an oral contraceptive to animals by Gregory Goodwin Pincus and Min Chueh Chang and to women by John Rock.

In 1957, he became vice president of research at Syntex in Mexico City while on leave of absence from Wayne State. In 1960 Djerassi became a professor of chemistry at Stanford University, a position he held until 2002 but only part-time as he never left industry. From 1968 until 1972 he also served as president of Syntex Research at Palo Alto.

The Syntex connection brought wealth to Djerassi. He bought a large tract of land in San Mateo County, California, and started a cattle ranch called SMIP. (Initially an acronym for &quot;Syntex Made It Possible&quot;, other variants have been suggested since.) He also assembled a large art collection. His collection of works by Paul Klee was considered to be one of the most significant to be privately held. He arranged for his Klee collections to be donated to the Albertina in Vienna and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, effective on his death.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Djerassi continued to do significant scientific work, as a professor in the department of chemistry at Stanford University, and as an entrepreneur. He pioneered novel physical research techniques for mass spectrometry and optical rotatory dispersion and applied them to the areas of organic chemistry and the life sciences. Focusing on the steroid hormones and alkaloids, he elucidated the structure of steroids, an area in which he published over 1,200 papers. His scientific interests were wide-ranging, and his technological achievements include work in instrumentation, pharmaceuticals, insect control, the application of artificial intelligence in biomedical research, and the biology and chemistry of marine organisms.

In 1968, he started a new company, Zoecon, which focused on environmentally soft methods of pest control, using modified insect growth hormones to stop insects from metamorphosing from the larval stage to the pupal and adult stages. Zoecon was eventually acquired by Occidental Petroleum, which later sold it to Sandoz, now Novartis. Part of Zoecon survives in Dallas, Texas, making products to control fleas and other pests.

In 1965 at Stanford University, nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg, computer scientist Edward Feigenbaum, and Djerassi devised the computer program DENDRAL (dendritic algorithm) for the elucidation of the molecular structure of unknown organic compounds taken from known groups of such compounds, such as the alkaloids and the steroids. This was a prototype for expert systems and one of the first uses of artificial intelligence in biomedical research.

Djerassi was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; and was chairman of the Pharmanex Scientific Advisory Board.

==Publications==
Djerassi published widely as a novelist, playwright and scientist. In 1985, Djerassi said &quot;I feel like I&#x27;d like to lead one more life. I&#x27;d like to leave a cultural imprint on society rather than just a technological benefit.&quot;
He went on to write several novels in the &quot;science-in-fiction&quot; genre, including &quot;Cantor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, in which he explored the ethics of modern scientific research through his protagonist, Dr. Cantor. He also wrote four autobiographies, the most recent of which, &quot;In Retrospect&quot; appeared in 2014. He wrote a number of plays which have been performed and extensively translated. His book &quot;Chemistry in Theatre: Insufficiency, Phallacy or Both&quot; discusses the potential pedagogic value of using dialogic style and the plot structure of plays with special focus on chemistry.

===Science-in-fiction===
Djerassi wrote five novels, four of which he described as &quot;science-in-fiction&quot;, fiction that portrays the lives of real scientists, with all their accomplishments, conflicts, and aspirations. The genre is also referred to as Lab lit.

In his first two novels, &quot;Cantor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Bourbaki Gambit&quot;, he shows how scientists work and think. In &quot;Cantor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, there is the suspicion of scientific fraud; in &quot;Bourbaki Gambit&quot; the question of personal achievement stands in the center. In the third, &quot;Menachem&#x27;s Seed&quot;, ICSI and the Pugwash organization are the main themes. In the last, &quot;NO&quot;, he shows how young scientists develop an idea as far as founding a company to market a product – something Djerassi himself did in the field of insecticides.

The topic of the fifth novel, &quot;Marx Deceased&quot;, is the role of a writer&#x27;s earlier bestsellers for the assessment of a new work – in contrast to the assessment of an anonymous work or one of a formerly unknown author. He also plays with this topic in &quot;Bourbaki Gambit&quot;.

===Science-in-theatre===
After his success with prose literature in the Science-in-Fiction genre, Djerassi started to write plays. Theatre, even more so than prose, seemed to fulfill his desire to work in a more “dialogical” environment than the monological natural sciences had allowed him to do. According to British director Andy Jordan, who has produced all of his plays in England, Djerassi&#x27;s dramatic works are &quot;not wholly or straightforwardly naturalistic or realistic […but] avowedly text-driven, where ideas, themes, words and language were majorly important, a fact I had always to be conscious of as the director.2

Djerassi&#x27;s first play, &quot;An Immaculate Misconception&quot; (1998), dealing with the in vitro fertilization procedure ICSI, was followed by two plays about priority struggles in the history of science, &quot;Oxygen&quot; (co-authored with Roald Hoffmann, 1999) and &quot;Calculus&quot; (2002), and a drama at the intersection of chemistry and art history, &quot;Phallacy&quot; (2004). &quot;Ego&quot; (2003, also produced under the title &quot;Three on a Couch&quot;), together with the docudrama &quot;Four Jews on Parnassus&quot; (2006, publ. 2008) and &quot;Foreplay&quot; (2010), are the only three dramatic pieces that do not deal with science-in-literature but rather carry the notion of intellectual competitiveness into literature, philosophy and the humanities. &quot;Taboos&quot; (2006), a complex play between reproductive, gender and political issues, returns to Djerassi&#x27;s central concerns as a scientist; his 2012 play &quot;Insufficiency&quot; is a bitter satire of both the scientific community and academic environments. &quot;ICSI, sex in the age of mechanical reproduction&quot; (2002), was taken to theaters and also to classrooms as a pedagogic wordplay, in many countries, including Spain and Argentina (by collaboration with Dr Àgata Baizán and Alberto Diaz) where it opened the VIII Latinoamerican and Caribbean Biotechnology meeting REDBIO-Argentina 2013 and featured in universities and theaters.

As in his novels, Djerassi&#x27;s plays incorporate the life and achievements of (sometimes famous) scientists as well as new scientific technologies. The science in his plays is always scientifically plausible although the dramatic personae and locations are fictitious. By placing scientists and research into dramatic worlds, he raises critical questions about the sciences as cultural systems and looks into internal conflicts and contradictions in science and between scientists. The constant competition between them, the need for priority in new scientific discoveries even if the required speed necessitates risky and immoral means, as well as the problematic consequences of new discoveries are important topics of the plays.
Connected with many of these questions is the role of women in the sciences (including researchers’ wives and female friends). Djerassi&#x27;s plays recognize the special contributions women make as scientists and to science, both directly and indirectly. His female characters are usually depicted as strong and independent, proving a strong impact of feminist thinking on his work.

Djerassi&#x27;s plays have found their way into theaters around the globe and have been translated into many European and Asian languages. Djerassi repeatedly revised his plays and some of them have different versions and multiple endings (especially &quot;An Immaculate Misconception&quot;: the nationalities of the main characters vary, also the endings). Where possible, Djerassi also cooperated with directors in the production of dramatic performances. All of his plays have been published in book form, many of them in a number of languages. Some of them can be downloaded from his website.

=== Poetry ===
Djerassi wrote numerous poems that were published in journals or anthologies. Some of the poems reflected his life as a chemist (e.g. &quot;Why are chemists not poets&quot; or &quot;The clock runs backwards&quot;), others his personal life (e.g. &quot;A Diary of Pique&quot;).

==Awards and honors==

Djerassi won numerous awards during his career including:
*Ernest Guenther Award in Chemistry and Natural Products by the American Chemical Society (1960)
* Scheele Award (1972)
* National Medal of Science (President of the United States of America, 1973) for his work on the contraceptive pill (The award was somewhat ironic in that his name at the time was on the infamous &quot;Nixon&#x27;s enemies list&quot;, which was compiled by Charles Colson and Richard Nixon. He learned this from an article in the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, several months later.)

An award that eluded Djerassi was the Nobel Prize, where he is considered one of the more notable &quot;snubs&quot; by the Nobel Committee.

==Personal life==
Djerassi described himself as a &quot;Jewish atheist&quot;.

Djerassi was married three times and had two children. He and Virginia Jeremiah were married in 1943 and divorced in 1950. Djerassi married writer Norma Lundholm (1917–2006) later that year. They had two children together, and were divorced in 1976. One year after his second divorce, Djerassi began a relationship with Diane Middlebrook, a Stanford University professor of English and biographer. In 1985, they were married and they lived between San Francisco and London, until her death on December 15, 2007, due to cancer.

On July 5, 1978, Djerassi&#x27;s artist daughter Pamela (born 1950; from his second marriage, to Norma Lundholm), committed suicide, which is described in his autobiography. With Middlebrook&#x27;s help, Djerassi then considered how he could help living artists, rather than collecting works of dead ones. He visited existing artist colonies, such as Yaddo and MacDowell, and decided to create his own, the Djerassi Resident Artists Program. He closed his cattle ranch and converted the barn and houses to residential and work space for artists. He and his wife moved to a high rise in San Francisco that they had renovated.

Carl Djerassi died on January 30, 2015, at the age of 91, from complications of liver and bone cancer. Upon his death he was survived by his son and grandson.

<text>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is the third largest Institute of the National Institutes of Health, located in Bethesda, Maryland, United States. It is tasked with allocating about $3.6 billion in FY 2020 in tax revenue to advancing the understanding of the following issues: development and progression of disease, diagnosis of disease, treatment of disease, disease prevention, reduction of health care disparities within the American population, and advancing the effectiveness of the US medical system. NHLBI&#x27;s Director is Gary H. Gibbons (2012–present).

==Operation==
In 1948, the National Heart Act established the National Heart Institute and the National Advisory Heart Council. The intramural research program was established a year later in 1949. In 1969, the National Heart Institute was renamed the National Heart and Lung Institute, and the scope of the institute was expanded. In 1976, it was given its current name, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. It had been designated as the agency responsible for blood research by the National Heart, Blood Vessel, Lung, and Blood Act of 1972, after the newly created National Sickle Cell Disease Program was put under its aegis.

The Institute plans, conducts, fosters, and supports an integrated and coordinated program of basic research, clinical investigations and trials, observational studies, and demonstration and education projects. Research is related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases, and sleep disorders. The NHLBI plans and directs research in development and evaluation of interventions and devices related to prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of patients with such diseases and disorders. It also supports research on clinical use of blood and all aspects of the management of blood resources. Research by scientific institutions and individuals is supported by research grants and contracts through the NHLBI Extramural Program, while the NHLBI Division of Intramural Research conducts state-of-the-art research on the NIH Bethesda campus in its own laboratories.

For health professionals and the public, the NHLBI conducts educational activities, including development and dissemination of materials in the above areas, with an emphasis on prevention.

The NHLBI supports research training and career development of new and established researchers in fundamental sciences and clinical disciplines to enable them to conduct basic and clinical research related to heart, blood vessel, lung, and blood diseases, sleep disorders, and blood resources through individual and institutional research training awards (T90/R90), career development awards (K), and fellowships (i.e. T32/F32).

The NHLBI coordinates relevant activities in the above areas, including the related causes of stroke, with other research institutes and federal health programs. Relationships are maintained with institutions and professional associations, and with international, national, state, and local officials as well as voluntary agencies and organizations working in the above areas.

The NHLBI Division of Intramural Research (DIR) in Bethesda conducts research and training in a wide variety of areas broadly related to the mission of the institute, both clinical research and basic science research. There are 60 investigators, each of whom runs their own research program. They are supported by a group of core services that implement state-of-the-art techniques available to all NHLBI investigators. Marshall Nirenberg, Nobel laureate for his part in the discovery of the genetic code, became the head of the Section of Biochemical Genetics in 1962. The DIR also has a large training component, with opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students as well as post-doctoral training.

The NHLBI sponsors National Wear Red Day and the Heart Truth campaign, a national awareness campaign for women about heart disease.

== Organization ==
The research arm of the institute is organized into the following divisions:
* Biochemistry and Biophysics Center
* Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Branch
* Cardiovascular Epidemiology and Human Genomics Branch
* Cell &amp; Developmental Biology Center
* Center for Molecular Medicine
* Hematology Branch
* Immunology Center
* Population Sciences Branch
* Sickle Cell Branch
* Systems Biology Center

<text>A pessary is a prosthetic device inserted into the vagina for structural and pharmaceutical purposes. It is most commonly used to treat stress urinary incontinence to stop urinary leakage and to treat pelvic organ prolapse to maintain the location of organs in the pelvic region. It can also be used to administer medications locally in the vagina or as a method of contraception. 

Pessaries come in different shapes and sizes, so it is important that individuals be fitted for them by health care professionals to avoid any complications. However, there are a few instances and circumstances that allow pessaries to be purchased without a prescription or without seeking help from a health care professional. Some side effects may occur if pessaries are not sized properly or regularly maintained, but with the appropriate care, pessaries are generally safe and well tolerated.

== History ==
 Early use of pessaries dates back to the ancient Egyptians, as they described using pessaries to treat pelvic organ prolapse. The term &#x27;pessary&#x27; itself, is derived from the Ancient Greek word &#x27;pessós&#x27;, meaning round stone used for games. Pessaries are even mentioned in the oldest surviving copy of the Greek medical text, Hippocratic Oath, as something that physicians should never administer for the purposes of an abortion: &quot;Similarly I will not give to a woman a pessary to cause abortion.&quot; The earliest documented pessaries were natural products. For example, Greek physicians Hippocrates and Soranus described inserting half of a pomegranate into the vagina to treat prolapse. It was not until the 16th century that the first purpose-made pessaries were made. For instance, in the late 1500s, Ambroise Paré was described as making oval pessaries from hammered brass and waxed cork. Nowadays, pessaries are generally made from silicone and are well tolerated and effective among patients who need them.

== Medical uses ==

=== Pelvic organ prolapse ===
The most common use for pessaries is to treat pelvic organ prolapse. A pelvic organ prolapse can occur when the muscles and tissues surrounding the bladder, uterus, vagina, small bowel, and rectum stop working properly to hold the organs in place and the organs begin to drop outside the body. The most common cause of such prolapse is childbirth, usually multiple births. Obesity, long-term respiratory problems, constipation, pelvic organ cancers, and hysterectomies can all be causes for pelvic organ prolapses as well. Some signs and symptoms include feeling pressure in the pelvic area, lower back pain, painful intercourse, urinary incontinence, a feeling that something is out of place, constipation, or bleeding from the vagina. Pessaries are manual devices that are inserted into the vagina to help support and reposition descended pelvic organs, which helps to prevent the worsening of prolapse, helps with symptom relief, and can delay or prevent the need for surgery. Further, pessaries can be used for surgery preparation as a way to maintain prolapse without progression. This is especially useful when a surgery may need to be delayed.

=== Stress urinary incontinence ===
Stress urinary incontinence is leakage of urine that is caused by sudden pressure on the bladder. It occurs during activities that increase the amount of pressure on the bladder such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, and exercising. The pressure causes opening of the sphincter muscles which usually help prevent urine leakage. Stress urinary incontinence is a common medical problem especially in women as about 1 in 3 women are affected by this condition at some point in their lives. Pessaries are considered a safe non-surgical treatment option for stress urinary incontinence as it can control the urine leakage by pushing the urethra closed. Pessaries can be removed any time.

=== Other ===
Some additional uses for pessaries are for an incarcerated uterus, prevention of preterm birth and an incompetent cervix. In early pregnancy the uterus can be displaced, which can lead to pain and rectal and urinary complications. A pessary can be used to treat this condition and support the uterus. Preterm birth is when babies are born prematurely, which puts the baby at increased risk for complications and even death. Currently, the use of pessaries to help prevent preterm birth is an ongoing area of research. The use of pessaries for an incompetent cervix is not commonly practiced today, but they have been used in the past. Specifically, an incompetent cervix is when the cervix begins to open up prematurely. This can lead to a preterm birth or even a miscarriage. Pessaries can be used to correctly position the cervix, increasing the success of pregnancy.

==Types of pessaries==
=== Therapeutic pessaries ===
A therapeutic pessary is a medical device similar to the outer ring of a diaphragm. Therapeutic pessaries are used to support the uterus, vagina, bladder, or rectum. Pessaries are most commonly used for pelvic organ prolapse and considered a good treatment option for women who need or desire non-surgical management or future pregnancy. It is used to treat prolapse of uterine, vaginal wall (vaginal vault), bladder (cystocele), rectum (rectocele), or small bowel (enterocele). It is also used to treat stress urinary incontinence.

There are different types of pessaries but most of them are made out of silicone—a harmless and durable material. Pessaries are mainly categorized into two types, supporting pessaries and space-occupying pessaries. Support pessaries function by supporting the prolapse and space-occupying pessaries by filling the vaginal space. There are also lever type pessaries.

====Support pessary====

Ring with support pessaries are the supporting type. These are often used as a first-line treatment and used for earlier stage prolapse since individuals can easily insert and remove them on their own without a doctor&#x27;s help. These can be easily folded in half for insertion.

Gellhorn pessaries are considered a type of supporting and space-occupying pessary. These resemble the shape of a mushroom and are used for more advanced pelvic organ prolapse. These are less preferred than ring with support pessaries due to difficulty with self-removal and insertion.

Marland pessaries are another type of supporting pessary. These are used to treat pelvic organ prolapse as well as stress urinary incontinence. These pessaries have a ring at their base and a wedge-shaped ridge on one side. Although these pessaries are less likely to fall out than standard ring with support pessaries, individuals find it difficult to insert or remove them on their own.

====Space-occupying pessary====

Donut pessaries are considered space-occupying pessaries. These are used for more advanced pelvic organ prolapse including cystocele or rectocele as well as a second or third-degree uterine prolapse. Due to its shape and size, it is one of the hardest ones to insert and remove.

Cube pessaries are space-occupying pessaries in the shape of a cube that are available in 7 sizes. The pessary is inserted into the vagina and kept in place by the suction of its 6 surfaces to the vaginal wall. Cube pessaries must be removed before sexual intercourse and replaced daily. Cube pessaries are generally used as a last resort only if the individuals cannot retain any other pessaries. This is due to undesirable side effects such as vaginal discharge and erosion of the vaginal wall. In order to remove the cube pessary, the suction must be broken by grasping the device.

Gehrung pessaries are space-occupying pessaries that are similar to the Gellhorn pessaries. They are silicone devices that are placed into the vagina and used for second or third degree (more severe) uterine prolapse. These contain metal and should be removed prior to any MRI, ultrasound or X-rays. They can also be used to help with stress urinary incontinence such as urine leaks during exercising or coughing. These types of pessaries need to be fitted by a health care professional to ensure proper size. Once placed it should not move when standing, sitting, or squatting. It should be cleaned with mild soap and warm water every day or two.

====Lever pessary====

Hodge pessaries are a type of lever pessary. Although these can be used for mild cystocele and stress urinary incontinence, they are not commonly used. Smith, and Risser pessaries are other types of lever pessaries and they differ in shape.

===Pharmaceutical pessaries===
Treating vaginal yeast infections is one of the most common uses of pharmaceutical pessaries. They are also known as vaginal suppositories, which are inserted into the vagina and are designed to dissolve at body temperature. They usually contain a single use antifungal agent such as clotrimazole. Oral antifungal agents are also available.

Pessaries can also be used in a similar way to help induce labor for women who have overdue expected delivery dates or who experience premature rupture of membranes. Prostaglandins are usually the medication used in these kinds of pessaries in order to relax the cervix and promote contractions.

According to Pliny the Elder, pessaries were used as birth control in ancient times.

=== Occlusive pessaries ===
Occlusive pessaries are most commonly used for contraception. Also known as a contraceptive cap, they work similar to a diaphragm as a barrier form of contraception. They are inserted into the vagina and block sperm from entering the uterus through the cervix. The cap must be used in conjunction with a spermicide in order to be effective in preventing pregnancy. When used correctly the cap is thought to be 92–96% effective. These caps are reusable but come in different sizes. It is recommended for anyone attempting this form of contraception to be fitted for the correct size by a trained health care professional.

====Stem pessary====
The stem pessary, a type of occlusive pessary, was an early form of the cervical cap. Shaped like a dome, it covered the cervix, and a central rod or &quot;stem&quot; entered the uterus through the external orifice of the uterus, also known as the cervical canal or the os, to hold it in place.

==Side effects and complications==

When pessaries are used correctly, they are tolerated well for pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence. However, pessaries are still a foreign device that is inserted into the vagina, so side effects can occur. Some more common side effects include vaginal discharge and odor. Vaginal discharge and odor may be associated with bacterial vaginosis, characterized by an overgrowth of naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina. These symptoms can be treated with the appropriate medications.

More serious side effects include fistula formation between the vagina and rectum or the vagina and bladder, or erosion, or thinning, of the vaginal wall. Fistula formation is rare, but erosion of the vaginal wall occurs more frequently. Low estrogen production can also increase the risk of vaginal wall thinning. For individuals with pessaries that are not fitted for them, herniations of the cervix and uterus can occur through the opening of the pessary. This can lead to tissue necrosis in the cervix and uterus. To prevent these side effects, individuals can be fitted properly for their pessaries and undergo routine follow-up visits with their health care professionals to ensure the individual has the correct pessary size and no other complications. In addition, those with an increased risk of vaginal wall thinning can be prescribed estrogen to prevent erosion and prevent these complications.

If pessaries are not used properly or not maintained periodically, more serious complications can occur. For example, the pessary can become embedded into the vagina, which makes it harder to remove. Estrogen can decrease the inflammation of the vaginal walls and promote skin cells in the vagina to mature, so use of estrogen cream can allow removal of the pessary more easily. In rare cases, pessaries would need to be removed through surgical procedures.

To prevent complications, individuals should not use pessaries if they have characteristics that exclude them from this method of therapy. Contraindications to pessary use include current infections in the pelvis or vagina, or allergies to the material of the pessary (which can be silicone or latex). In addition, individuals should not be fitted for a pessary if they are less likely to properly maintain their pessary.

<text>The Commandos Marine, nicknamed &quot;Bérets Verts&quot; (Green Berets), are the special operation forces (SOF) of the French Navy, headquartered in Lorient, Brittany in western France. They operate under the Special Operations Command (COS), FORFUSCO, one of the four main forces of the French Navy or any operational command designated by the French Army staff. They specialize in offshore operations; operations from sea to land and special operations on land. One of the major characteristics of marine commando units is to be perfectly interoperable with all the resources and units of the navy (vessels, aircraft, submarines).

Comprising seven operational units of around 90 men and around 160 in specialized support, their missions include: hostage rescue, evacuation operations, intelligence within enemy lines, (assault on high-value targets), Navy missions (assault at sea, remote support and destruction, reconnaissance, underwater action) as well as certain missions in support of naval airforce: amphibious operations, guidance and fire support, reinforcement teams, embargo control and State actions at sea against illegal fishing, immigration and trafficking.

==History==
The &quot;Commandos Marine&quot; were formed in 1942 during World War II in the United Kingdom and were modelled on the British Commandos (who were founded in 1940). They were formed from Free French volunteers from different services, mainly from Navy &quot;Fusiliers Marins&quot; (protection forces), other navy specialities and even from the army. They were trained at the Commando Training Centre in Achnacarry, Scotland and joined No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando as the 1st and the 8th Troops. To commemorate this, the beret of the French naval commandos is worn pulled to the right with the badge worn over the left eye or temple, the opposite of all other French military units.
The 1st BFMC (&quot;Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos&quot;, Commando Sailor Riflemen Battalion) took part in the Normandy Landing on D-Day under the command of Lieutenant Commander Philippe Kieffer, on Sword, and were for the occasion integrated in No. 4 Commando. They further participated in the Netherlands campaign, still associated with No. 4 Commando. When the British Commando Units were disbanded at the conclusion of World War II, the two French Troops (forming the 1st BFMC) were repatriated to France to relieve in position the 1st RFM (1st Sailor Riflemen Regiment) departing for Indochina. Most of them demobilised or returned to their services (army or other navy specialities) but Commander Philippe Kieffer made the case to the French Ministry of the Navy that a Commando Corps was a capacity required to counter the guerrilla warfare in Indochina. The surviving members of the 1st BFMC formed the core leadership and the cadres for the Commando Training School to be created in Algeria in 1946 (Siroco Center, Matifou Cape).

Another branch comes from a Naval Reconnaissance Unit created in December 1944, Company NYO, formed from volunteers from different parts of the Navy, mainly Sailor Riflemen (&quot;Fusiliers Marins&quot;) and Naval Artillery. This unit later renamed as Company Merlet (the name of its founder and commanding officer, Lieutenant (Navy) Jean Merlet), fought in Italy before embarking for Indochina in September 1945. It was renamed Company Jaubert, then naturally became Commando Jaubert, the first unit to be constituted as Commando when the French Navy decided to create a Commando Corps in 1946.

Commander Pierre Ponchardier and his Special Air Service Battalion aka SAS-B (also nicknamed Tigers Commandos), created in early 1945, fought in Indochina until 1946 before the battalion was disbanded. Ponchardier was a visionary of modern SOF. Although he was not subordinated to a Sailor Rifleman chain of command, he ran large-scale operations in conjunction and with the support of Compagnie Merlet/Jaubert and the 1st RFM. His audacity, the innovation of the TTPs and the course of actions he applied in guerrilla warfare and COIN set the spirit and were disseminated to the overall &quot;Commandos Marine&quot; organisation.

By a 19 May 1947 decision, the Ministry of the Navy decision created five &quot;Commando Marine&quot; units, organised and designed as the former British Commandos. The French Navy transformed several &quot;Fusiliers Marins&quot; companies (Sailor Riflemen) already combatting in Indochina (including Company Jaubert) or based aboard French Navy destroyers (to become Commando Trepel and Commando de Penfentenyo) and gradually renewed their personnel with commando-qualified recruits after the Siroco Center (commando course) was commissioned. Commando François and Commando Hubert were formed from scratch. Although Commando Jaubert was already trained for parachute and airborne operations, Commando Hubert became the official paratrooper commando unit for the French Navy. For this reason, they integrated by preference and priority former Ponchardier SAS-B members, who were already jump qualified.

Each Commando Marine bears the name of an officer killed in action during World War II or during the Indochina campaign:

Captain Charles Trepel was an Army officer (artillery), Free French Forces; commanding officer of the 8th Troop (French), No. 10 Commando (Inter-allied). MIA/KIA 28 February 1944 during a night reconnaissance raid in Wassenaar, the Netherlands.

Lieutenant Augustin Hubert was an Army officer (infantry), Free French Forces; platoon leader in the K-Gun Troop (French) operating in support of Troop 1 and 8 (French) integrated for D-Day to the No. 4 Commando. He was killed 6 June 1944, in the first hour of combat, when the French Troops were maneuvering to seize the Casino of Ouistreham near Sword.

Commander François Jaubert was a Navy officer, commanding the Riverine Flotilla in Indochina, severely wounded during a joint operation with Compagnie Merlet, Ponchardier SAS-B and the 1st RFM and his Flotilla. He died of his wounds 25 January 1946.

Lieutenant (junior grade) Alain de Penfentenyo was a Navy officer, commanding officer of an LCVP platoon, killed in action during a riverine raid on the Donai river, 14 February 1946 (Indochina).

Lieutenant (junior grade) Louis de Montfort was a Company Merlet platoon commander. After his commander was wounded and evacuated de Montfort took command and was killed leading the company in Haiphong, 26 November 1946 (Indochina).

Lieutenant Jacques François was a Navy officer, commanding the 1st Amphibious Flotilla North. He was killed leading his unit, 6 January 1947 on the Nam-Dinh-Giang river (Indochina).

Commando François suffered dramatic losses on 29 May 1951 when it faced the attack of the 308th Vietminh division in Ninh Bình (Indochina). Only 29 survived, five were taken prisoner for months, 40 were killed and nine were declared missing in action. Their sacrifice disrupted the surprise effect and unveiled General Giap&#x27;s plans for the battle of Day. It gave French General de Lattre time to organise his counterattack. This commando unit was disbanded in May 1953.

Commando Hubert officially became a combat swimmer unit on 30 March 1953. It was a joint unit composed of Navy and Army (SDEC, secret service) combat swimmers. The army branch later separated to establish their base in Aspretto, Corsica (France) and today in Quélern, Brittany (France).

Commando Kieffer was created 6 June 2008 in Ouistreham during the D-Day commemoration ceremony.

In May 2019, four hostages were freed from terrorists during an operation in Burkina Faso. French commandos took down the location in Burkina Faso which was considered a terrorist camp. Two operatives from &quot;Hubert&quot; Underwater Operations Commando were killed in the operation which took place in the early morning hours of Friday morning.

==Recruitment and training==
Most of the recruits must have completed the &quot;Fusiliers-Marins&quot; Basic Training and served at least nine months of service. They have to enter a special forces basic training course, called &quot;Stage Commando&quot; (commando training) and reputed to be one of the toughest among the NATO Special Operation Forces. In 2016, the Stage Commando had an attrition rate of 82%. The SOF Basic Training is open to sailors or enlisted from other Navy specialties. Commando Kieffer recruits specialists and experts from other specialties in the Navy or other services. They must go through the same training pipeline to earn the green beret and be deployed overseas.

Commando training is the gateway to the Special Operations Forces for the Sailor Riflemen. Conducted at the Fusilier Marins school at Lorient on the Atlantic coast, it provides upon successful completion entry to the commandos and the right to wear the green beret. Lasting 20 weeks, it includes one week of commando testing, six weeks of screening and preparatory training, four weeks of evaluation, the actual SOF course for seven weeks, and two weeks of parachute training. During this period, any mistake can instantly disqualify the candidate. The ultimate goal of this training is to detect individuals with the physical, intellectual and psychological potential needed to serve in the Commandos Marine. The historical roots of commando training date back to the Second World War, when Fusilier-Marins volunteers from the Free French Navy went to the Commando training center in Achnacarry, Scotland. Since then, the Commandos Marine have kept by tradition the green beret pulled right with the bronze shield badge on the left, the only such exception in the French armed forces. They have retained the principle of exceptional training without compromise, based on immersion in a highly stressful environment, close to the conditions of combat operations.

The prospective Commandos in training are constantly under stress and pressure from instructors leaving them no respite. All activities are timed and scored: marching tens of kilometers with equipment and weapon in all weathers, obstacle courses and night navigation exercises. The training is punctuated by firearms training and assault tactics, climbing and rappelling, boat handling, explosives instruction and hand-to-hand combat. The instructors are experienced operatives assigned to the Commando School who monitor and punish failure with extra-hard physical activity.

Some of the firearms utilized are: Heckler &amp; Koch USP, Glock 17, PAMAS G1 (French licensed copy of the Beretta 92), Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, HK416 and the FAMAS rifle (but only for training). From 1996 to 2015 they used ETRACO inflatable boats, which were then replaced by a new system called ECUME.

==Composition==
Their personnel are distributed between seven &quot;commandos&quot; of around 90 men, with the exception of commando &quot;Ponchardier&quot; which comprises around 160 personnel, named after former commando officers killed in action, and are dedicated maritime counter-terrorist units:


===Commando Hubert===

Since the 1950s, the combat swimmer unit of the French Navy have been formed as Commando Hubert, also known as French commando frogmen, the only Commandos Marine unit having combat swimmers. The tip of the spear of the overall Commandos Marine organization, their military capacities are broader than combat swimming operations. They are publicly known to be a Special Mission Unit supporting counter terrorism along with GIGN (see Ouvea cave, &quot;MS Pascal Paoli&quot;). Jacques-Yves Cousteau was a naval officer in World War II and helped to set up France&#x27;s commando frogmen. France further developed the role of commando frogmen in the First Indochina War.

The French intelligence service DGSE also has combat-swimmers brought together in the &quot;Centre Parachutiste d&#x27;Entraînement aux Opérations Maritimes&quot; (CPEOM, &quot;maritime operations training parachutist center&quot;) at Roscanvel.

While these are the only French combat-diver units, other French units have divers, including:
* the military engineer units of the French Army have two types of divers:
** the &quot;spécialistes d&#x27;aide au franchissement&quot; (SAF, &quot;specialists for help in clearing&quot;): swimmers trained to recon and clear banks and bridges to permit their use by military vehicles.
** the &quot;nageurs d&#x27;intervention offensive&quot; (NIO, swimmers &quot;for offensive actions&quot;): they accomplish missions similar to combat swimmers but in rivers and estuaries, to destroy bridges inside enemy territory for example and belong to an engineer-regiment. 
* some commando units like the commando group of the 2nd foreign parachutist regiment and the special unit forces of the Army and the Air Force have offensive divers.
* the GIGN and RAID counter-terrorist groups have divers trained to assault a hijacked ship in support of Commando Hubert.

====List of operations====
*1982-1984: Lebanon
*1987: Actions in the Persian Gulf.
*1988 May 5: a hostage rescue in New Caledonia: see Ouvéa cave hostage taking.
*1991: Embargo in the Persian Gulf.
*1992 December - 1993: Somalia: Operation Restore Hope.
*1994: Rwanda: evacuating foreign nationals caught up in a civil war.
*1997 March - 2000: Mission Alba in Albania.
*1999: Operation Allied Force in FR Yugoslavia.
*2001 July: Security at the G8 meeting in Genoa in Italy.
*2001 October: Afghanistan and/or Philippines: Operation Enduring Freedom.
*2008 September: French naval commandos freed two hostages (Jean-Yves and Bernadette Delanne) held by Somali pirates aboard their yacht off the coast of Somalia, killing one gunman and capturing six.
*Since January 2013 : Multiple counter-terrorist operations during the Mali war, part of Operation Serval and Operation Barkhane 
*May 2019: Burkina Faso hostage rescue by Commando Hubert

<doc id="574499" wikidata="Q12211516" url="?curid=574499" title="List of English words of Arabic origin">
<text>Arabic is a Semitic language and English is an Indo-European language. The following words have been acquired either directly from Arabic or else indirectly by passing from Arabic into other languages and then into English. Most entered one or more of the Romance languages, before entering English.

To qualify for this list, a word must be reported in etymology dictionaries as having descended from Arabic. A handful of dictionaries have been used as the source for the list. Words associated with the Islamic religion are omitted; for Islamic words, see Glossary of Islam. Archaic and rare words are also omitted. A bigger listing including words very rarely seen in English is at .

Given the number of words which have entered English from Arabic, this list is split alphabetically into sublists, as listed below:

*[[List of English words of Arabic origin (A-B)]]

*[[List of English words of Arabic origin (G-J)]]
*[[List of English words of Arabic origin (K-M)]]

===List of Arabic star names===
===Arabic botanical names===
The following plant names entered medieval Latin texts from Arabic. Today, in descent from the medieval Latin, they are international systematic classification names (commonly known as &quot;Latin&quot; names): &quot; Azadirachta, Berberis, Cakile, Carthamus, Cuscuta, Doronicum, Galanga, Musa, Nuphar, Ribes, Senna, Taraxacum, Usnea, Physalis alkekengi, Melia azedarach, Centaurea behen, Terminalia bellerica, Terminalia chebula, Cheiranthus cheiri, Piper cubeba, Phyllanthus emblica, Peganum harmala, Salsola kali, Prunus mahaleb, Datura metel, Daphne mezereum, Rheum ribes, Jasminum sambac, Cordia sebestena, Operculina turpethum, Curcuma zedoaria, Alpinia zerumbet + Zingiber zerumbet.&quot; (List incomplete.)

Over ninety percent of those botanical names were introduced to medieval Latin in a herbal medicine context. They include names of medicinal plants from Tropical Asia for which there had been no prior Latin or Greek name, such as azedarach, bellerica, cubeba, emblica, galanga, metel, turpethum, zedoaria and zerumbet. Another sizeable portion are ultimately Iranian names of medicinal plants of Iran. The Arabic-to-Latin translation of Ibn Sina&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; helped establish many Arabic plant names in later medieval Latin. A book about medicating agents by Serapion the Younger containing hundreds of Arabic botanical names circulated in Latin among apothecaries in the 14th and 15th centuries. Medieval Arabic botany was primarily concerned with the use of plants for medicines. In a modern etymology analysis of one medieval Arabic list of medicines, the names of the medicines —primarily plant names— were assessed to be 31% ancient Mesopotamian names, 23% Greek names, 18% Persian, 13% Indian (often via Persian), 5% uniquely Arabic, and 3% Egyptian, with the remaining 7% of unassessable origin.

The Italian botanist Prospero Alpini stayed in Egypt for several years in the 1580s. He introduced to Latin botany from Arabic from Egypt the names Abrus, Abelmoschus, Lablab, Melochia, each of which designated plants that were unknown to Western European botanists before Alpini, plants native to tropical Asia that were grown with artificial irrigation in Egypt at the time.

In the early 1760s Peter Forsskål systematically cataloged plants and fishes in the Red Sea area. For genera and species that did not already have Latin names, Forsskål used the common Arabic names as the scientific names. This became the international standard for most of what he cataloged. Forsskål&#x27;s Latinized Arabic plant genus names include Aerva, Arnebia, Cadaba, Ceruana, Maerua, Maesa, Themeda, and others.

Some additional miscellaneous botanical names with Arabic ancestry include Abutilon, Alchemilla, Alhagi, Argania, argel, Averrhoa, Avicennia, azarolus&quot; + acerola&quot;, bonduc, lebbeck, Retama, seyal. (List incomplete).

===Arabic textile words===
The list above included the six textile fabric names cotton, damask, gauze, macramé, mohair, &amp; muslin, and the three textile dye names anil, crimson/kermes, and safflower, and the garment names jumper and sash. The following are three lesser-used textile words that were not listed: camlet, morocco leather, and tabby. Those have established Arabic ancestry. The following are six textile fabric words whose ancestry is not established and not adequately in evidence, but Arabic ancestry is entertained by many reporters. Five of the six have Late Medieval start dates in the Western languages and the sixth started in the 16th century. Buckram, Chiffon, Fustian, Gabardine, Satin, and Wadding (padding). The fabric Taffeta has provenance in 14th-century French, Italian, Catalan, Spanish, and English, and today it is often guessed to come ultimately from a Persian word for woven (&quot;tāftah&quot;), and it might have Arabic intermediation. Fustic is a textile dye. The name is traceable to late medieval Spanish &quot;fustet&quot; dye, which is often guessed to be from an Arabic source. Carthamin is another old textile dye. Its name was borrowed in the late medieval West from Arabic قرطم &quot;qartam | qirtim | qurtum&quot; = &quot;the carthamin dye plant or its seeds&quot;. The textile industry was the largest manufacturing industry in the Arabic-speaking lands in the medieval and early modern eras.

<doc id="574517" wikidata="Q7639411" url="?curid=574517" title="Sunday Herald">
<text>The Sunday Herald was a Scottish Sunday newspaper, published between 7 February 1999 and 2 September 2018. Originally a broadsheet, it was published in compact format from 20 November 2005. The paper was known for having combined a centre-left stance with support for Scottish devolution, and later Scottish independence. The last edition of the newspaper was published on 2 September 2018 and it was replaced with Sunday editions of &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;The National&quot;&quot;.

==Circulation==
In July 2012, the newspapers&#x27; publishers classified the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; as a regional instead of a national title.

Between July and December 2013, the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; sold an average of 23,907 copies, down 7.5% on the 12 months previous. After declaring support for Scottish independence, The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; received a huge increase in sales, with circulation in September 2014 up 111% year on year.

By 2017 circulation had fallen to 18,387 and in August 2018 staff were told they would now be expected to work on the &quot;Herald&quot; too, with the potential for the two titles to be combined at some point in the future.

==History==
===Background===
In early 1998 the Scottish Media Group (SMG), then led by chairman Gus Macdonald, decided to create a Sunday sister for its existing national morning title &quot;The Herald&quot;, because the Glasgow-based media group was losing advertising revenue to rival newspaper publishers every Sunday. In March 1998 the media company&#x27;s board appointed Andrew Jaspan, then the publisher and managing director of &quot;The Big Issue&quot; and a former editor of &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; to examine the business case for launching a new Sunday title. In October 1998 SMG (now known as STV Group plc), which also owns the broadcaster STV, committed to putting £10 million behind the new paper&#x27;s launch.

===Jaspan&#x27;s launch team===
Jaspan assembled a launch team including former Hue &amp; Cry singer Pat Kane, TV producer and presenter Muriel Gray and BBC political commentator Iain Macwhirter and designer Simon Cunningham. Other former BBC television and radio journalists who joined the title included Lesley Riddoch, Torcuil Crichton and Pennie Taylor. A number of former &quot;Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; staff also joined the new paper, as did several journalists from &quot;The Big Issue&quot; Scottish edition including Neil Mackay, David Milne and Iain S Bruce.

The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; was launched as a seven-section newspaper on 7 February 1999. It was advertised with the slogan &quot;No ordinary Sunday&quot;. The use of the word &quot;fuck&quot; in the first edition of the magazine alienated older and more conservative readers, but the paper quickly won a following among more liberal-minded Scots. It also won a raft of awards for its journalism, design and photography, in the UK and internationally, and secured the former archbishop Richard Holloway and &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; scriptwriter Budd Schulberg as regular contributors. Its web version gained a large readership in the United States because of its consistent anti-George W. Bush and anti-Iraq War line.

===Sale to Newsquest===

After having over-paid for acquisitions during the dot-com era, Scottish Media Group was in serious financial trouble by 2002. The company decided to sell its publishing arm, whose assets included &quot;The Herald&quot;, &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and &quot;Evening Times&quot; and magazines including &quot;Scottish Farmer&quot;, &quot;Boxing News&quot; and &quot;The Strad&quot; and a public auction, accompanied by a heated public debate, ensued.

When it looked like the Barclay brothers, owners of rival papers &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, were set to become the publishing group&#x27;s owners, questions were raised in the Scottish Parliament. Had Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay and Andrew Neil succeeded in acquiring the fledgling &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, they would have closed it down to give a clear run to their own &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; title, and merged &quot;The Herald&quot; with &quot;The Scotsman&quot;. Determined to prevent the paper being acquired by those with no sympathy for its centre-left ethos, Jaspan led a campaign to keep it out of their hands. This included lobbying senior Labour Party (UK) politicians at their September 2002 conference in Blackpool.

The campaign proved successful, with even the &quot;Financial Times&quot; questioning whether it was right for the Barclays to have a monopoly of quality papers published in Scotland. The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; and related titles were sold instead to Newsquest (a Gannett company) for £216 million. This was cleared by the UK Department of Trade and Industry in March 2003, partly because it was persuaded the papers would keep their editorial independence under Gannett&#x27;s ownership and because of Gannett&#x27;s creation of a new Scottish division to run the acquired papers from Glasgow. The DTI report said: &quot;We do not expect the transfer adversely to affect the current editorial freedom, the current editorial stance, content or quality of the SMG titles, accurate presentation of news or freedom of expression.&quot; The deal completed on 5 April 2003.

Jaspan resigned in 2004 to become editor of &quot;The Age&quot; in Melbourne, Australia. Richard Walker was appointed as his successor. Walker, a former production journalist on both the &quot;Daily Record&quot; and &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; had been with the title since its launch and had served as deputy to Jaspan for five years.

===The Walker years===
Richard Walker took the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; tabloid in November 2005 which brought a temporary uplift in circulation. Sales settled at 58,000 (source: Audit Bureau of Circulations) (ABC), and readership at 195,000 (source: National Readership Survey). The week before the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; was launched in February 1999, the Barclays&#x27; &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot; sold more than 130,000 copies. This had fallen to c.46,000 in June 2012, about 75% higher than the circulation of the Sunday Herald (26,074) according to ABC figures.

Walker was behind the launch of the blog site Sundayheraldtalk.com in September 2006.

===Taxigate===
In April 2006 the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; Scottish political editor, Paul Hutcheon, won both Political Journalist of the Year and Journalist of the Year in the Scottish Press Awards for articles revealing that David McLetchie, leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, had abused taxpayers&#x27; money to pay for taxi fares for legal and party work. Hutcheon made use of the Scottish Freedom of Information Act to establish his case, which ultimately led to McLetchie resigning both as Conservative leader and as a partner in Edinburgh law firm Tods Murray.

===Super injunctions===
On 22 May 2011, the paper became the first mainstream UK publication to name a person involved with a super injunction. In &quot;CTB v News Group Newspapers&quot; the claimant, a footballer previously known only as CTB, was identified by publishing as its front page an image of Ryan Giggs whose eyes are covered with a black bar which features the word &quot;censored&quot;. The paper argued that the injunction was not valid in Scotland which is a separate jurisdiction and only applicable to England, however one legal opinion suggests that the Scottish news outlet may be in breach an English injunction due to a House of Lords ruling in the 1987 Spycatcher case. The paper was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of weekend paper by the European Newspaper Congress in 2011.

===Independence referendum===
The &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; was the only Scottish newspaper to back a vote for independence in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.
Alasdair Gray designed a special front page for the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; in May 2014 when it came out in favour of a &quot;Yes&quot; vote. The cover consisted of a large thistle framed by Scottish saltires.

===Closure===
The newspaper ceased publication in late 2018, after falling sales.

<doc id="574518" wikidata="Q3408258" url="?curid=574518" title="Ground beef">
<text>Ground beef, minced beef or beef mince - often just generically referred to as mince or mincemeat, is beef that has been finely chopped with a knife, meat grinder (American English), mincer or mincing machine (British English). It is used in many recipes including hamburgers, bolognese sauce, meatloaf, meatballs, kofta, and burritos.

Note that mincemeat may also refer to a mixture of chopped fruit, distilled spirits, and spices, with or without minced/ground meat, as found in Mince pies.

== Contents ==
In many countries, food laws define specific categories of ground beef and what they can contain. For example, in the United States, beef fat may be added to hamburger but not to ground beef if the meat is ground and packaged at a USDA-inspected plant. In the U.S., a maximum of 30% fat by weight is allowed in either hamburger or ground beef. The allowable amount in France is 5 to 20% (15% being used by most food chains). In Germany, regular ground beef may contain up to 15% fat while the special &quot;Tatar&quot; for &quot;steak tartare&quot; may contain less than 5% fat. Both hamburger and ground beef can have added seasoning, phosphate, extenders, or binders added, but no additional water is permitted. Ground beef is often marketed in a range of different fat contents to match the preferences of customers.

Ground beef is generally made from the less tender and less popular cuts of beef. Trimmings from tender cuts may also be used.

In a study in the U.S. in 2008, eight brands of fast food hamburgers were evaluated for recognizable tissue types using morphological techniques that are commonly used in the evaluation of tissue&#x27;s histological condition. The study of the eight laboratory specimens found the content of the hamburgers included:
* Water: 37.7% to 62.4% (mean, 49%)
* Muscle: 2.1% to 14.8% (median, 12.1%)
* Skeletal tissue: &quot;Bone and cartilage, observed in some brands, were not expected; their presence may be related to the use of mechanical separation in the processing of the meat from the animal. Small amounts of bone and cartilage may have been detached during the separation process.&quot;
* Connective tissue
* Blood vessels
* Peripheral nerve tissue. Brain tissue was not detected in any of the samples.
* Adipose tissue—&quot;The amount of lipid observed was considerable and was seen in both adipose tissue and as lipid droplets. Lipid content on oil-red-O staining was graded as 1+ (moderate) in 6 burgers and 2+ (marked) in 2 burgers.&quot;
* Plant material: &quot;was likely added as a filler to give bulk to the burger&quot;

=== &quot;Pink slime&quot; ===

Ground beef in the United States may contain a meat-based product used as a food additive produced using technology known as advanced meat recovery systems or alternatively by using the slime system. Meat processing methods used by companies such as Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) and Cargill Meat Solutions produce lean, finely textured beef product, otherwise known as &quot;pink slime,&quot; from fatty beef trimmings. This meat-based product is then treated with antimicrobial agents to remove salmonella and other pathogens, and is included in a variety of ground beef products in the U.S. From 2001, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved the product for limited human consumption. In a 2009 article by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the safety of the beef processing method used by BPI was questioned. After the USDA&#x27;s approval, this product became a component in ground beef used by McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King and many other fast-food chains as well as grocery chains in the U.S. 

In government and industry records in testing for the United States&#x27; school lunch program, pathogens such as &quot;E. coli&quot; and salmonella were found dozens of times in meat from BPI, which raises questions about safety of the meat product and the effectiveness of the antimicrobial method used in meat recovery system of the company. Between 2005 and 2009, &quot;E. coli&quot; was found three times and salmonella 48 times. BPI had a rate of 36 positives for salmonella per 1,000 tests, compared to a rate of nine positives per 1,000 tests for other suppliers for the program. However, the program continued to source from BPI because its price was substantially lower than ordinary meat trimmings, saving about $1m a year for the program. Cargill, among the largest hamburger makers in the U.S., is a big buyer of the meat-based product from BPI for its patties, according to the Times. It suspended buying meat from two plants owned by BPI for several months in 2006 after excessive levels of salmonella were found.

== Cuts of beef ==
Although any cut of beef can be used to produce ground beef, chuck steak is a popular choice because of its rich flavor and meat-to-fat ratio. Round steak is also often used. In the United States, ground beef is usually categorized based on the cut and fat percentage:

* Chuck: 78–84% lean
* Round: 85–89% lean
* Sirloin: 90–95% lean

== Culinary use ==
Ground beef is popular as a relatively cheap and quick-cooking form of beef. Some of its best-known uses are in hamburgers, sausages and cottage pie. It is an important ingredient in meatloaf, sloppy joes, meatballs, and tacos, and as a pizza topping. It can be used to make meat sauces, for example, lasagna and spaghetti bolognese in Italian cuisine. In the Middle East, it is used to make spicy kofta and meatballs. The Scottish dish &#x27;mince and tatties&quot; uses it with mashed or boiled potatoes. In Lancashire, particularly Oldham, minced meat is a common filling for rag pudding. The Dutch slavink consists of ground meat (half beef, half pork) rolled in bacon.

Raw, lean, ground beef is used to make steak tartare, a French dish. More finely diced and differently seasoned, it is popular as a main course and as a dressing in Belgium, where it is known as filet américain (&quot;American fillet&quot;).

== Food safety ==
Food safety of ground meat is problematic; bacterial contamination occurs frequently. Undercooked hamburgers contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 were responsible for four deaths in the U.S. in 1993, and hundreds of people fell ill. Ground beef must be cooked to 72 °C (160 °F) to ensure all bacterial contamination—whether it be endogenous to the product or contaminated after purchasing by the consumer—is killed. The color of cooked meat does not always indicate the beef has reached the required temperature; beef can brown before reaching 68 °C (155 °F).

To ensure the safety of food distributed through the National School Lunch Program, food banks, and other federal food and nutrition programs, the United States Department of Agriculture has established food safety and quality requirements for the ground beef it purchases. A 2010 National Research Council report reviewed the scientific basis of the Department&#x27;s ground beef safety standards, compared the standards to those used by large retail and commercial food service purchasers of ground beef, and examined ways to establish periodic evaluations of the Federal Purchase Ground Beef Program. The report found that although the safety requirements could be strengthened using scientific concepts, the prevention of future outbreaks of foodborne diseases will depend on eliminating contamination during production and ensuring meat is properly cooked before it is served.

The 2013 horse meat scandal found traces of horse meat in many UK and European foods and ready meals that were mostly labelled as being minced/ground beef products.

<text>The Turbo-Union RB199 is a turbofan jet engine designed and built in the early 1970s by Turbo-Union, a joint venture between Rolls-Royce, MTU and Aeritalia. The only production application was the Panavia Tornado.

==Design and development==

The RB199 originated with a requirement, in 1969, to power a new European multirole combat aircraft (MRCA) called the Panavia MRCA. The engine requirements to meet the Panavia MRCA specification were significant advances over current engines in thrust-to-weight ratio, fuel consumption and size. The final selection of the engine for the MRCA was made between a new European collaboration, Turbo Union, with the RB199, and Pratt &amp; Whitney who proposed the JTF16. The Panavia MRCA would later be called the Panavia Tornado.

Advanced engine studies at Bristol Siddeley had already been done to support the BAC/Dassault AFVG and were based on the Pegasus two-spool arrangement. At Rolls-Royce, where the three-shaft RB211 engine was in development, three shafts were considered better. Rolls-Royce took over Bristol Siddeley in 1967 so the configuration for the RB199 was decided jointly, a three-shaft engine.

The overall design concept for the international collaborative program, three shafts and a bypass ratio (BPR) of about 1.2, was decided by Rolls-Royce. The bypass ratio was chosen for long-range, with low fuel consumption, particularly when throttled back. The selected BPR also gave a higher reheat boost than with smaller values used on similar engines. The design of the individual modules was shared between Rolls-Royce, MTU and Fiat according to their existing expertise. Rolls-Royce designed the fan using scaled-down Pegasus knowledge, the combustor, the high pressure (HP) turbine and the reheat. The reheat used cold air combustion techniques, described by Sotheran and which were derived from their experience with ramjets and plenum chamber burning (PCB) in Pegasus front nozzles. Fiat had built turbines for the Viper so designed the low pressure (LP) turbine as well as the final nozzle. MTU designed the intermediate pressure(IP) and high pressure (HP) compressors, the IP turbine, and the thrust reverser.

A three-spool arrangement reduces the pressure ratio on each compressor so no variable stators were needed. To meet the short afterburner requirement an arrangement known as mix-then-burn, as used in current engines, was not possible because it was too long and heavy. The RB199 used a much shorter arrangement known as mix/burn. 

The RB199 first ran on 27 September 1971 at Patchway, UK. It was flight-tested using an Avro Vulcan with the engine installed in a nacelle that was representative of the Tornado aircraft. The Vulcan first flew with the RB199 in 1972.

Service flying with the Royal Air Force, German Navy and German and Italian Air Forces in the European environment showed normal failure mechanisms for turbine blades, thermal fatigue, creep and high cycle fatigue (HCF) so development started on replacing the initial production equiaxed blades with single-crystal ones which last longer at high temperatures.

Sand ingestion tests had been done and passed as part of the qualification for service introduction but operating in desert conditions with the Royal Saudi Air Force produced new problems. Frequent flying in air carrying different sizes of sand particles caused deposits on the HP turbine blades from sand passing through the combustor. In addition, sand carried with the cooling air through the blades blocked the cooling holes. Single crystal blades were being introduced to improve the life of the blades for the European operating conditions and revised cooling hole arrangements were introduced at the same time to reduce the detrimental effect of sand on blade cooling. With incorporation of these blade processing and cooling changes &quot;Desert Storm Tornado aircraft flew some of the most arduous missions of any Allied aircraft with reliability no worse than peacetime and no engines were rejected for HP Turbine blade defects.&quot;
Looking back on the RB199 program in 2002 Chief Engineer for the RB199, Dr.Gordon Lewis, concluded &quot;The final production standard provided satisfactory reliability and performance.&quot;

<text>Per Olov Enquist, also known as P. O. Enquist, (23 September 1934 – 25 April 2020) was a Swedish author. He had worked as a journalist, playwright and novelist.

==Biography==
Enquist was born and raised in Hjoggböle, a village in present-day Skellefteå Municipality, Västerbotten. He was the only son of a single mother, who became a widow when he was half a year old. In his youth, he was a promising athlete with a high jump personal best of 1.97 meters. He studied at Uppsala University, receiving a degree in the history of literature.

During his time in Uppsala he started writing, his first novel &quot;Kristallögat&quot; being published in 1961, and became a newspaper journalist. Enquist won the Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize in 1968 for &quot;The Legionnaires&quot;, his account of Sweden&#x27;s deportation of Baltic-country soldiers at the end of the second world war, a novel which also became his international breakthrough. Enquist was to write several more novels based on true events. &quot;Kapten Nemos bibliotek&quot; (1991) took inspiration from where two newly born boys were accidentally switched; &quot;The Visit of the Royal Physician&quot; (1999) was based on the life of Danish King Christian VII and his physician Johann Friedrich Struensee, and Struensee&#x27;s political machinations and relationship with the King&#x27;s wife Caroline Matilda in the 1770s; &quot;Lewis resa&quot; (2001) covered the life of Pentecostalist Lewi Pethrus; while &quot;Boken om Blanche och Marie&quot; (2004) was based on the friendship of Marie Curie and mental patient Marie &quot;Blanche&quot; Wittman. Enquist&#x27;s first stage play was &quot;Tribadernas natt&quot; (1975), a story about Swedish author August Strindberg, his soon-to-be ex-wife Siri von Essen, and von Essen&#x27;s presumed lover .

Awards for his writing have included the Dobloug Prize in 1988, the Selma Lagerlöf Prize in 1997, and the Italian Flaiano Prize in 2002. Besides books and stage plays, Enquist also wrote screenplays for motion pictures, including &quot;Pelle Erövraren&quot; (1987) and &quot;Hamsun&quot; (1996), and at the 27th Guldbagge Awards in 1993, Enquist was nominated for the award for Best Screenplay for the film &quot;Il Capitano: A Swedish Requiem&quot;. He also received the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize as well as the Nelly Sachs Prize in 2003 for &quot;The Visit of the Royal Physician&quot;. &quot;The Visit of the Royal Physician&quot; also became the first of two books by Enquist to be awarded the August Prize, the other being his 2008 autobiography &quot;Ett annat liv&quot;. Enquist was awarded the Austrian State Prize for European Literature in 2009 and the Swedish Academy&#x27;s Nordic Prize in 2010.

Enquist died on 25 April 2020 after a prolonged struggle with cancer.

<doc id="574531" wikidata="Q122990" url="?curid=574531" title="Daphne (plant)">
<text>Daphne (, &quot;laurel&quot;) is a genus of between 70 and 95 species of deciduous and evergreen shrubs in the family Thymelaeaceae, native to Asia, Europe and north Africa. They are noted for their scented flowers and often brightly coloured berries. Two species are used to make paper. Many species are grown in gardens as ornamental plants; the smaller species are often used in rock gardens. All parts of daphnes are poisonous, especially the berries.

==Description==
&quot;Daphne&quot; species are shrubs, with upright or prostrate stems. Upright species may grow to . Their leaves are undivided, mostly arranged alternately (although opposite in &quot;D. genkwa&quot;), and have short petioles (stalks). The leaves tend to be clustered towards the end of the stems and are of different shapes, although always longer than wide. The leaf surface may be smooth (glabrous) or hairy.

Many species flower in late winter or very early spring. The flowers are grouped into clusters (inflorescences), either in the leaf axils towards the end of the stems or forming terminal heads. The inflorescences lack bracts. Individual flowers completely lack petals and are formed by four (rarely five) petaloid sepals, tubular at the base with free lobes at the apex. They range in colour from white, greenish yellow or yellow to bright pink and purple. Most of the evergreen species have greenish flowers, while the deciduous species tend to have pink flowers. There are twice the number of stamens as sepals, usually eight, arranged in two series. Stamens either have short filaments or lack filaments altogether and are usually held inside the sepal tube. The style is short or absent, and the stigma is head-shaped (capitate).

The ovary has a single chamber (locule). The fruits are one-seeded, and are either fleshy berries or dry and leathery (drupaceous). When ripe the fruit is usually red or yellow, sometimes black.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Daphne&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Linnaeus recognized 10 species, including &quot;Daphne mezereum&quot;, &quot;Daphne laureola&quot; and &quot;Daphne cneorum&quot;. Some of his species are now placed in other related genera (e.g. Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Daphne thymelaea&quot; is now &quot;Thymelaea sanamunda&quot;). The number of species in the genus varies considerably between different authorities. The &quot;Flora of China&quot; states there are about 95 species, 41 of which are endemic to China. Some of these species were reduced to subspecies or varieties by Josef Halda in a series of papers from 1997 onwards, culminating in a monograph on the genus. Version 1.1 of The Plant List accepts 83 species. The &quot;Flora of North America&quot; states there are 70 species.

===Phylogeny and generic limits===
A 2002 study based on chloroplast DNA placed &quot;Daphne&quot; in a group of related genera; however there was only one species representing each genus.

A further study published in 2009 included an extra species of &quot;Wikstroemia&quot; and suggested that this genus was paraphyletic with respect to &quot;Stellera&quot;, but otherwise agreed with the cladogram above. The distinction between &quot;Wikstroemia&quot; and &quot;Daphne&quot; is difficult to make; Halda included &quot;Wikstroemia&quot; within &quot;Daphne&quot;. The cladogram shown above suggests that other genera would need to be included as well to make &quot;Daphne&quot; monophyletic.

*&quot;D.&quot; × &quot;schlyteri&quot; – artificial hybrid &quot;D. cneorum&quot; × &quot;D. arbuscula&quot;

==Distribution==
&quot;Daphne&quot; is a Eurasian genus, being native to central and southern Europe and Asia, from Britain to Japan. Some species are also found in north Africa. Two species, &quot;D. mezereum&quot; and &quot;D. laureola&quot;, have been introduced into North America.

==Uses==
Two species, &quot;Daphne bholua&quot; and &quot;Daphne papyracea&quot;, both called &quot;lokta&quot;, are sustainably harvested in Nepal and Bhutan for paper production.

Many species are cultivated as ornamental shrubs in gardens. The smaller species are used as rock garden plants or, in the case of those more difficult to grow, as plants for the alpine house. It is recommended that they are grown in well drained but moisture-retentive soil, avoiding strongly acid conditions. Most species prefer a sunny position, although some are woodland plants (e.g. &quot;D. mezereum&quot; and &quot;D. pontica&quot;). Propagation is by seed, cuttings or layering.

===Award of garden merit===
The following species, hybrids and cultivars are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
*&quot;Daphne arbuscula&quot; 
*&quot;Daphne bholua&quot; &#x27;Jacqueline Postill&#x27; 
*&quot;Daphne bholua&quot; var. &quot;glacialis&quot; &#x27;Gurkha&#x27; 
*&quot;Daphne&quot; × &quot;burkwoodii&quot; &#x27;Somerset&#x27; 
*&quot;Daphne cneorum&quot; &#x27;Eximia&#x27; 
*&quot;Daphne&quot; × &quot;rollsdorfii&quot; &#x27;Wilhelm Schacht&#x27; 
*&quot;Daphne tangutica&quot; Retusa Group 
*&quot;Daphne&quot; × &quot;transatlantica&quot; = &#x27;Blafra&#x27; 
==Toxicity==
All parts of daphnes are toxic, the berries being particularly so. One active compound is daphnin, a glycoside, combining glucose with daphnetin. Some species have been shown to contain a further toxin, mezerein. Symptoms of ingestion include burning sensations and lesions of the mouth and upper digestive tract, gastroenteritis and diarrhoea, and in severe cases, damage to the kidneys (nephritis), irregular heart rhythm, and coma.

==Allergenicity==

Daphnes have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 5 out of 10, indicating moderate potential to cause allergic reactions, exacerbated by over-use of the same plant throughout a garden. The sap and berry juice can cause dermatitis and the scent may affect the odor-sensitive.

<text>.xxx (pronounced &quot;dot triple-ecks&quot; or &quot;dot ecks ecks ecks&quot;) is a sponsored top-level domain (sTLD) intended as a voluntary option for pornographic sites on the Internet. The sponsoring organization is the International Foundation for Online Responsibility (IFFOR). The registry is operated by ICM Registry LLC. The ICANN Board voted to approve the sTLD on 18 March 2011. It went into operation on 15 April 2011.

The TLD entered its sunrise period on 7 September 2011 at 16:00 UTC; the sunrise period ended 28 October 2011. Landrush period lasted from 8 November through 25 November, and general availability commenced on 6 December 2011.

==Background==
A gTLD (generic top-level domain) for sexually explicit material was proposed as one tool for dealing with the conflict between those who wish to provide and access such material through the Internet, and those who wish to prevent access to it, either by children and adolescents, or by employees at their workplaces.

Advocates of the idea argue that it will be easier for parents and employers to block the entire TLD, rather than using more complex and error-prone content-based filtering, without imposing any restrictions on those who wish to access it. Editors of explicit content sites, however, were afraid that the use of a single TLD like codice_1 would also make it easier for search engines to block all of their content.

Critics of the idea argue that because there is no requirement for providers of explicit content to use the TLD, sexually explicit material will still be commonplace in other domains, making it ineffectual at restricting access, and simply creating a new &quot;landrush&quot; as registrants of .com domains hosting explicit material attempt to duplicate their registrations in the codice_1 domain, competing with operators who hope to register desirable names unavailable in other TLDs. There is also concern that the existence of codice_1 will lead to legislation making its use &quot;mandatory&quot; for sexually explicit material, leading to legal conflicts over the definition of &quot;sexually explicit&quot;, free speech rights, and jurisdiction.

There were also early indications that codice_1 domain names will be registered not with the intent to focus on pornographic content, but to use the adult connotations as a benefit to a marketing strategy. An example is the registration of codice_5, which is aimed at the extreme sport of kitesurfing, thus benefiting from sexual connotations and innuendo for humor and promotional purposes. Another example of a codice_1 domain name being registered without a focus on pornographic content was the registration of codice_7, which contained pro-Islamic content despite being named after Pope Benedict XVI.

==Proposal by ICM Registry==
The .XXX TLD was first proposed in 2000 by ICM Registry and resubmitted in 2004, but it faced strong opposition from politicians and conservative groups.

ICANN announced on 1 June 2005 a preliminary approval of codice_1 as an sTLD similar to codice_9, codice_10, etc. ICM said it would charge $60/year for domains. In December 2005, discussions about the implementation of codice_1 were taken off the agenda of ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), placing its future in doubt. In its March 2006 meeting, the GAC formulated a letter of concern to the ICANN board about codice_1. On 10 May 2006, ICANN reversed the approval. On 6 January 2007, ICANN put up for public comment a revised proposal following changes to the policy of the ICM registry including the policing of any site that signs up to use the codice_1 registry. On 30 March 2007, the ICANN board again rejected the codice_1 proposal for the third time.

On 6 June 2008, in accordance with ICANN bylaws, ICM filed an application with the International Centre for Dispute Resolution for an independent review challenging ICANN&#x27;s decision. The filing became ICDR Case No. 50 117 T 00224 08, and in September 2009, a live hearing was held in Washington, DC, where both sides submitted documentary evidence and witness testimony. On 19 February 2010, the ICDR&#x27;s independent review panel – consisting of Stephen M. Schwebel, Jan Paulsson and Dickran Tevrizian – issued its declaration. The panel found that the application for the &quot;.XXX sTLD met the required sponsorship criteria&quot;, and that &quot;the Board’s reconsideration of that finding was not consistent with the application of neutral, objective and fair documented policy&quot;. At the ICANN meeting in Nairobi in March 2010 the board resolved to consider &quot;process options&quot;. A 45-day public comment was opened on 26 March 2010. At the Brussels ICANN meeting in June 2010, the ICANN board resolved to restart the process, including renewed due diligence and GAC consultations.

On 18 March 2011, ICANN&#x27;s board approved the execution of the registry agreement with ICM for the codice_1 sponsored top level domain. The vote was nine in favor, four against, with three abstentions.

ICM is expected to make over $200 million a year, with 3 to 5 million domain registrations, as companies are anticipated to defensively register their domains.

==Opposition==
===Manwin suits===
On 16 November 2011, Manwin International, a pornography company that operates a large number of popular adult websites including YouPorn, filed a request for a second ICANN Independent Review Proceeding. In the request, Manwin asks that the .xxx delegation be voided, or, if not, put up to competition on renewal.

On the same day Manwin, together with adult film studio Digital Playground, filed a suit in the Central District of California against ICM alleging antitrust and competition violations. Among the claims in the suit are that ICANN provided &quot;no competitive process for the award of the .XXX registry contract&quot; and that ICM CEO Stuart Lawley &quot;has announced that he expects to be able (and intends) to prevent the establishment of any other (potentially competing) adult-content TLDs, including through a contractual promise by ICANN not to approve such TLDs&quot;.

On 14 August 2012, Judge Philip S. Gutierrez granted in part and denied in part ICANN&#x27;s motion to dismiss Manwin&#x27;s claims and allowed the case against ICANN to move forward. On 10 May 2013, the case was voluntarily dismissed by the parties, likely due to private settlement.

===Free Speech Coalition===
The Free Speech Coalition opposed the domain, arguing it would &quot;harm the adult entertainment business&quot; by inviting censorship and blocking, while raising money for ICM without considering the &quot;best interests of the industry&quot;.

==Alternative implementations==
Starting in 2005, there was an alternative implementation of codice_1 by New.net, a private domain registration service unaffiliated with ICANN, via an alternative DNS root. New.net no longer offers domain names under this unofficial TLD.

Another unofficial codice_1 TLD was previously available through the alternative DNS root system administered by the now-defunct AlterNIC.

<text>Amalafrid (, ) was the son of the last Thuringian king Hermanafrid and his wife Amalaberga, daughter of Amalafrida and niece of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great.

After the fall of the royal Thuringian seat of Scithingi to the king of Metz, Theuderic I in 531, Amalaberga fled to the Ostrogothic king Theodahad, her brother, with Amalafrid and his sister Rodelinda. They were captured by the Byzantine general Belisarius and sent to Constantinople, together with the captured Ostrogothic king Witiges (or Wittigis). Justinian made Amalafrid a general and married off his sister Rodelinda to the Lombard king Audoin.

When the Lombards applied to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I for help against the Gepids, he sent an army under the command of Justinus and Justinianus, the sons of Germanus; Aratius and Suartuas (a former ruler of the Heruli); and Amalafrid. All the former remained in Ulpiana, Illyria, to decide on a question of doctrine among the local Christians. Amalafrid led part of the Roman army against the Gepids. As Audoin afterwards sent envoys to Justinian to complain about the lack of Imperial help, this seems to have been only a small part of the original army. Nevertheless, Amalafrid and the Lombard host under Audoin won a major victory over the Gepids.

Amalafrid had a son named Artachis (see Venantius Fortunatus, Carm. App. 3) but nothing further is known of his fate.

<doc id="574536" wikidata="Q1829415" url="?curid=574536" title="List of United States presidential assassination attempts and plots">
<text>Assassination attempts and plots on the president of the United States have been numerous, ranging from the early 19th century to the present day. This article lists assassinations and assassination attempts on incumbent and former presidents and presidents-elect, but not on those who had not yet been elected president.

Four sitting presidents have been killed: Abraham Lincoln (1865, by John Wilkes Booth), James A. Garfield (1881, by Charles J. Guiteau), William McKinley (1901, by Leon Czolgosz), and John F. Kennedy (1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald). Ronald Reagan (1981, by John Hinckley Jr.) is the only sitting U.S. president to have been injured in an assassination attempt. Theodore Roosevelt (1912, by John Schrank) and Donald Trump (2024, by Thomas Matthew Crooks) are the only two former presidents to be injured in an assassination attempt, both while campaigning for reelection. Roosevelt would go on to lose his reelection bid, while Trump won his.

In all of these cases, the attacker&#x27;s weapon was a firearm, and all the subjects were male. Gerald Ford experienced two attempted assassinations with a woman as the assailant.

Many assassination attempts, both successful and unsuccessful, were motivated by a desire to change the policy of the American government. Not all such attacks, however, had political reasons. Many other attackers had questionable mental stability, and a few were judged legally insane. Historian James W. Clarke suggests that most assassination attempters have been sane and politically motivated, whereas the Department of Justice&#x27;s legal manual claims that a large majority have been insane. Some assassins, especially mentally ill ones, acted solely on their own, whereas those pursuing political agendas have more often found supporting conspirators. Most assassination plotters were arrested and punished by execution or lengthy detention in a prison or insane asylum.

The fact that the successor of a removed president is the vice president, and all vice presidents since Andrew Johnson have shared the president&#x27;s political party affiliation, may discourage such attacks, at least for policy reasons, even in times of partisan strife. The third person in line, the Speaker of the House, as outlined in the Presidential Succession Act, is often of the opposing party, however.

Threats of violence against the president are often made for rhetorical or humorous effect without serious intent, while &quot;credibly&quot; threatening the president of the United States has been a federal felony since 1917.

==Presidents assassinated==

===Abraham Lincoln===

Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was the first U.S. president to be assassinated (though not the first to die in office). The assassination took place on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., at about 10:15 PM. The assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was a well-known actor and a Confederate sympathizer from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate Army, he had contacts within the Confederate Secret Service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865 speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for Black people, Booth decided to assassinate the president instead. Learning that the president would be attending Ford&#x27;s Theatre, Booth planned with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln at the theater. The conspiracy also included assassinating Vice President Andrew Johnson in Kirkwood House, where Johnson lived while Vice President, and Secretary of State William H. Seward at Seward&#x27;s house. On April 14, 1865, Lincoln attended the play &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Ford&#x27;s Theatre. As the president sat in his state box in the balcony watching the play with his wife Mary and two guests, Major Henry Rathbone and Rathbone&#x27;s fiancée Clara Harris, Booth entered from behind. He aimed a .44-caliber Derringer pistol at the back of Lincoln&#x27;s head and fired, mortally wounding him. Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped. An unconscious Lincoln was examined by doctors and taken across the street to the Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 AM on April 15.

As he died, his breathing grew quieter, his face more calm. According to some accounts, at his last drawn breath, on the morning after the assassination, he smiled broadly and then expired. Historians, particularly author Lee Davis, have emphasized Lincoln&#x27;s peaceful appearance when and after he died: &quot;It was the first time in four years, probably, that a peaceful expression crossed his face.&quot; Field wrote in a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;there was &#x27;no apparent suffering, no convulsive action, no rattling of the throat...[only] a mere cessation of breathing&#x27;... I had never seen upon the President&#x27;s face an expression more genial and pleasing.&quot; The president&#x27;s secretary, John Hay, saw &quot;a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features&quot;.

Beyond Lincoln&#x27;s death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded, and Johnson&#x27;s would-be attacker did not follow through. After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on April 26, 1865, by Union Army soldiers at a farm in Virginia, some south of Washington. After refusing to surrender, Booth was fatally shot by Union cavalryman Boston Corbett. Four other conspirators were later hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.

President Lincoln was succeeded by Vice President Andrew Johnson on April 15, 1865.

===James A. Garfield===

The assassination of James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, took place at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C., at 9:20 AM on Saturday, July 2, 1881, less than four months after he took office. As the president was arriving at the train station, writer and lawyer Charles J. Guiteau shot him twice with a .442 Webley British Bull Dog revolver; one bullet grazed the president&#x27;s shoulder, and the other pierced his back. For the next eleven weeks, Garfield endured the pain and suffering from having been shot, before dying on September 19, 1881, at 10:35 PM, of complications caused by iatrogenic infections, which were contracted by the doctors&#x27; relentless probing of his wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments. He had survived for a total of 79 days after being shot.

Guiteau was immediately arrested. After a highly publicized trial lasting from November 14, 1881, to January 25, 1882, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. A subsequent appeal was rejected, and he was executed by hanging on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia, two days before the first anniversary of the shooting. Guiteau was assessed during his trial and autopsy as mentally unbalanced or suffering from the effects of neurosyphilis. He claimed to have shot Garfield out of disappointment at being passed over for appointment as Ambassador to France. He attributed the president&#x27;s victory in the election to a speech he wrote in support of Garfield.

President Garfield was succeeded by Vice President Chester A. Arthur on September 19, 1881.

===William McKinley===

The assassination of United States president William McKinley took place at 4:07 PM on Friday, September 6, 1901, at the Temple of Music in Buffalo, New York. McKinley, attending the Pan-American Exposition, was shot twice in the abdomen at close range by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist, who was armed with a .32-caliber Iver Johnson &quot;Safety Automatic&quot; revolver that was concealed underneath a handkerchief. The first bullet ricocheted off either a button or an award medal on McKinley&#x27;s jacket and lodged in his sleeve; the second shot pierced his stomach. Although McKinley initially appeared to be recovering, his condition rapidly declined due to gangrene setting in around his wounds and he died on September 14, 1901, at 2:15 AM.

Members of the crowd, started by James Benjamin Parker, subdued and captured Czolgosz. Afterward, the 4th Brigade, National Guard Signal Corps, and police intervened, beating Czolgosz so severely it was initially thought he might not live to stand trial. On September 24, after a two-day trial, in which the defendant refused to defend himself, Czolgosz was convicted and later sentenced to death. He was executed by the electric chair in Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901. Czolgosz&#x27;s actions were politically motivated, although it remains unclear what outcome, if any, he believed the shooting would yield.

Following President McKinley&#x27;s assassination, Congress directed the Secret Service to protect the president of the United States as part of its mandate.

President William McKinley was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt on September 14, 1901. 

===John F. Kennedy===

The assassination of United States president John F. Kennedy took place at 12:30 PM on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, during a presidential motorcade in Dealey Plaza. Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally&#x27;s wife Nellie when he was fatally shot by former U.S. Marine and American defector Lee Harvey Oswald (using a 6.5×52mm Carcano Model 38 rifle) from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. He was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head. Governor Connally was seriously wounded, and bystander James Tague received a minor facial injury from a small piece of curbstone that had fragmented after it was struck by one of the bullets. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was declared dead at 1:00 PM. Oswald was arrested and charged by the Dallas Police Department for the assassination of Kennedy and for the murder of Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit, who was shot dead in a residential neighborhood in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas just hours later. On Sunday, November 24, while being transferred from the city jail to the county jail, Oswald was fatally shot in the basement of Dallas Police Department Headquarters by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Ruby was convicted of Oswald&#x27;s murder, albeit his conviction was later overturned on appeal. In 1967, Ruby died in prison while awaiting a new trial.

In September 1964, the Warren Commission concluded that Kennedy and Tippit were both killed by Oswald, that Oswald had acted entirely alone in both murders, and that Ruby had acted alone in killing Oswald. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that up to 80% of Americans surveyed suspected that there was a plot or cover-up to kill President Kennedy. Conspiracy theories have persisted to the present day.

President John F. Kennedy was succeeded by Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson on November 22, 1963.

== Incumbent presidents wounded==

===Ronald Reagan===

On March 30, 1981, as Ronald Reagan was returning to his limousine after speaking at the Washington Hilton hotel, would-be assassin John Hinckley Jr., fired six gunshots using a .22 caliber Röhm RG-14 revolver toward him, striking Reagan and three others. Reagan was seriously wounded by a bullet that ricocheted off the side of the presidential limousine and hit him in the left underarm, breaking a rib, puncturing a lung, and causing serious internal bleeding. Although &quot;close to death&quot; upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital, Reagan was stabilized in the emergency room, and then underwent emergency exploratory surgery. He recovered and was released from the hospital on April 11. Besides Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Tim McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty were also wounded. All three survived, but Brady suffered brain damage and was permanently disabled; Brady&#x27;s death in 2014 was considered a homicide because it was ultimately caused by this injury.

Hinckley was immediately arrested, and later said he had wanted to kill Reagan to impress actress Jodie Foster. He was deemed mentally ill and confined to an institution. Hinckley was released from institutional psychiatric care on September 10, 2016, 35 years after the incident and 12 years after Reagan&#x27;s death from pneumonia complicated by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Former presidents wounded==

===Theodore Roosevelt===
Three-and-a-half years after he left office, Theodore Roosevelt ran in the 1912 presidential election as a member of the Bull Moose Party. While campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on October 14, 1912, John Schrank, a saloon-keeper from New York who had been stalking him for weeks, shot Roosevelt once in the chest with a .38-caliber Colt Police Positive Special. The 50-page text of his campaign speech titled &quot;&quot;, folded over twice in Roosevelt&#x27;s breast pocket, and a metal glasses case slowed the bullet, saving his life. Schrank was immediately disarmed, captured, and might have been lynched had Roosevelt not shouted for Schrank to remain unharmed. Roosevelt assured the crowd he was all right, then ordered police to take charge of Schrank and to make sure no violence was done to him.

Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 84 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I don&#x27;t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.&quot; Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pulmonary pleurae. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, and the bullet remained in Roosevelt&#x27;s body for the remainder of his life. He spent two weeks recuperating before returning to the campaign trail. Despite his tenacity, Roosevelt ultimately lost his bid for reelection to the Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson.

At Schrank&#x27;s trial, the would-be assassin claimed that William McKinley had visited him in a dream and told him to avenge his assassination by killing Roosevelt. He was found legally insane and was institutionalized until his death in 1943.

===Donald Trump===

On July 13, 2024, Donald Trump, former president of the United States and the Republican Party&#x27;s presumptive nominee in the 2024 presidential election, was shot by a bullet wounding his right ear while addressing a campaign rally near Butler, Pennsylvania. Shortly after Trump began addressing the rally, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks fired eight rounds with an AR-15–style rifle from the roof of a building located around from the stage. Crooks also killed audience member Corey Comperatore and critically injured two other audience members. Crooks was shot and killed by the U.S. Secret Service&#x27;s counter-sniper team. Video of the incident showed Trump clasping his right ear before taking cover on the floor of the podium, where he was shielded by Secret Service personnel. After agents helped him to his feet, Trump emerged with blood on his ear and face. He then either mouthed or shouted the words &quot;Fight! Fight! Fight!&quot; Photojournalist Evan Vucci of the Associated Press captured images of a bloodied Trump pumping his fist in the air, with an American flag in the background, which went viral on social media and were widely praised as iconic and historically significant. Trump was escorted off-stage and taken to a nearby hospital before being released in stable condition a few hours later. He won the election in November 2024.

, an investigation by the FBI has been underway. Crooks&#x27;s motivation remains unknown.

== Other attacks, assassination attempts, and plots ==

===Andrew Jackson===

* January 30, 1835: Just outside the Capitol Building, a house painter named Richard Lawrence attempted to shoot President Andrew Jackson with two pistols, both of which misfired. Later somebody tried the two pistols and both worked fine. Lawrence was apprehended after Jackson beat him severely with his cane. Lawrence was found not guilty by reason of insanity and confined to a mental institution until his death in 1861.

===Abraham Lincoln===
* February 23, 1861: President-elect Lincoln passed through Baltimore, Maryland amid threats of the Baltimore Plot, an alleged conspiracy by Confederate sympathizers in Maryland to assassinate Lincoln en route to his inauguration. Allan Pinkerton&#x27;s National Detective Agency played a key role in protecting the president-elect by managing Lincoln&#x27;s security throughout the journey. Although scholars debate whether the threat was real, Lincoln and his advisers took action to ensure his safe passage through Baltimore.
* December 1863: Confederate agent Godfrey Joseph Hyams claimed in 1865 that in December 1863 he had been recruited by Luke P. Blackburn into a plot to infect Northern cities with yellow fever by distributing clothes from patients infected with the disease throughout the target cities. Hyams also alleged that Blackburn had told him to deliver a batch of contaminated clothes to the White House to infect President Lincoln, but he had disobeyed this order. Unknown at the time was the fact that yellow fever is spread by mosquito bites and not by touch, so any such plot was doomed to failure. Blackburn stood trial after Hyams went public with his allegations but was acquitted.
* August 1864: A lone rifle shot fired by an unknown sniper missed Lincoln&#x27;s head by inches (passing through his hat) as he rode in the late evening, unguarded, north from the White House to the Soldiers&#x27; Home (his regular retreat where he would work and sleep before returning to the White House the following morning). Near 11:00 PM, Private John W. Nichols of the Pennsylvania 150th Volunteers, the sentry on duty at the gated entrance to the Soldiers&#x27; Home grounds, heard the rifle shot and moments later saw the president riding toward him &quot;bareheaded&quot;. Lincoln described the matter to Ward Lamon, his old friend and loyal bodyguard.
* April 1865: On April 1, Confederate agent Thomas F. Harney was dispatched from Richmond to Washington, D.C., on a mission to decapitate the United States government by killing President Lincoln and his cabinet. The plan was that Harney would blow up the White House after gaining access via a secret underground entrance. Union troops were tipped off about the plot by Confederate soldier William H. Snyder and Harney was arrested en route to Washington on April 10.
* April 11, 1865: John Wilkes Booth, who would make a successful attempt on Lincoln&#x27;s life three days later, attended Lincoln&#x27;s final public address in Washington, D.C., with his future co-conspirators David Herold and Lewis Powell. During the speech, Booth became enraged when Lincoln expressed his support for granting voting rights to former slaves and ordered Powell to shoot Lincoln. Powell ultimately decided against it for fear of the crowd, but Booth vowed to &quot;put him through&quot; and formulated a plan to kill Lincoln which came to fruition on April 14.

===William Howard Taft===

* 1909: William Howard Taft and Porfirio Díaz planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. Díaz requested the meeting to show U.S. support for his planned eighth run as president, and Taft agreed to support Díaz in order to protect the several billion dollars of American capital then invested in Mexico. Both sides agreed that the disputed Chamizal strip connecting El Paso to Ciudad Juárez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit, but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents, and U.S. Marshals were all called in to provide security. An additional 250-member private security detail led by Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was hired by John Hays Hammond. Hammond was a close friend of Taft from Yale University and a former candidate for U.S. vice president in the 1908 presidential election who, along with his business partner Burnham, held considerable mining interests in Mexico. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered 52-year-old Julius Bergerson holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured and disarmed Bergerson within only a few feet (around one meter) of Taft and Díaz.
* 1910: President Taft visited his aunt, Delia Torrey, in Millbury, Massachusetts. Torrey later reported receiving a stranger who allegedly overheard an assassination plot in Boston, Massachusetts. Before leaving nearby Worcester, Massachusetts by train, he threatened Torrey, who claimed the stranger &quot;did not want anything to get into the papers, and if it did he would come back and kill me.&quot; Torrey reported the plot to the local police, who shared the allegation with the Worcester Police and the Secret Service. The man was never identified.

===Herbert Hoover===
* November 19, 1928: President-elect Hoover embarked on a ten-nation &quot;goodwill tour&quot; of Central and South America. While he was crossing the Andes Mountains from Chile, an assassination plot by Argentine anarchists was thwarted. The group was led by Severino Di Giovanni, who planned to blow up his train as it crossed the Argentinian central plain. The plotters had an itinerary but the bomber was arrested before he could place the explosives on the rails. Hoover professed unconcern, tearing off the front page of a newspaper that revealed the plot and explaining, &quot;It&#x27;s just as well that Lou shouldn&#x27;t see it,&quot; referring to his wife. His complimentary remarks on Argentina were well received in both the host country and in the press.

===Franklin D. Roosevelt===

* February 15, 1933: Seventeen days before Roosevelt&#x27;s first presidential inauguration, Giuseppe Zangara fired five shots at Roosevelt in Miami, Florida. Zangara&#x27;s shots missed the president-elect, but Zangara did mortally wound Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak and injured four other people. Zangara pleaded guilty to the murder of Cermak and was executed in the electric chair on March 20, 1933. It has never been conclusively determined who was Zangara&#x27;s target, but most assumed at first that he had been shooting at the president-elect. Another theory is that the attempt may have been ordered by the imprisoned Al Capone, and that Cermak, who had led a crackdown on the Chicago Outfit and Chicago organized crime more generally, was the true target.
* 1943: Soviet NKVD claimed to have discovered a Nazi German Waffen-SS plan to assassinate Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference.

===Harry S. Truman===

* Mid-1947: During the Jewish insurgency in Palestine before the formation of the State of Israel, the Zionist paramilitary organization Lehi was alleged to have sent a number of letter bombs addressed to the president and high-ranking staff at the White House. At the time, the incident was not publicized, but Truman&#x27;s daughter Margaret Truman disclosed the alleged incident in her biography of Truman published in 1972; the allegation was previously disclosed in a memoir by Ira R. T. Smith, who worked in the mail room. According to Truman, the Secret Service was alerted by British intelligence after similar letters had been sent to high-ranking British officials and Lehi claimed credit; the mail room of the White House intercepted the letters intended for President Truman and the Secret Service defused them.
* November 1, 1950: Two Puerto Rican pro-independence activists, Oscar Collazo and Griselio Torresola, attempted to kill President Truman at the Blair House, where Truman was living while the White House was undergoing major renovations. In the attack, Torresola injured White House policeman Joseph Downs and mortally wounded White House policeman Leslie Coffelt. Coffelt returned fire, killing Torresola with a shot to the head. Collazo wounded an officer before being shot in the stomach. Collazo survived with serious injuries; Coffelt died of his wounds 4 hours later in a hospital. Truman was not harmed, but he was placed at a huge risk. Collazo was convicted in a federal trial and received the death sentence. Truman commuted Collazo&#x27;s death sentence to life in prison. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter further commuted Collazo&#x27;s sentence to time served.

===John F. Kennedy===
* December 11, 1960: While vacationing in Palm Beach, Florida, President-elect John F. Kennedy was threatened by Richard Paul Pavlick, a 73-year-old former postal worker driven by hatred of Catholics. Pavlick intended to crash his dynamite-laden 1950 Buick into Kennedy&#x27;s vehicle, but he changed his mind after seeing Kennedy&#x27;s wife and daughter bid him goodbye. Pavlick was arrested four days later by the Secret Service after being stopped for a driving violation; police found the dynamite in his car and arrested him. On January 27, 1961, Pavlick was committed to the United States Public Health Service mental hospital in Springfield, Missouri, then was indicted for threatening Kennedy&#x27;s life seven weeks later. Charges against Pavlick were dropped on December 2, 1963, ten days after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in Dallas. Judge Emett Clay Choate ruled that Pavlick was unable to distinguish between right and wrong in his actions, but kept him in the mental hospital. The federal government also dropped charges in August 1964, and Pavlick was eventually released from the New Hampshire State Hospital on December 13, 1966. He died in 1975 aged 88.

===Richard Nixon===
* April 13, 1972: Arthur Bremer carried a firearm to a motorcade in Ottawa, Canada, intending to shoot Nixon, but the president&#x27;s car went by too fast for Bremer to get a good shot. The next day, Bremer thought he saw Nixon&#x27;s car outside of the Centre Block, but it had disappeared by the time he could retrieve his gun from his hotel room. A month later, Bremer instead shot and seriously injured the governor of Alabama, George Wallace, who was paralyzed from the waist down until his death in 1998. Three other people were wounded. Bremer served 35 years in prison.
* February 22, 1974: Samuel Byck planned to kill Nixon by crashing a commercial airliner into the White House. He hijacked a DC-9 at Baltimore-Washington International Airport after killing a Maryland Aviation Administration police officer, and was told that it could not take off with the wheel blocks still in place. After he shot both pilots (one later died), an officer named Charles &#x27;Butch&#x27; Troyer shot Byck through the plane&#x27;s door window. He survived long enough to kill himself by shooting.

===Gerald Ford===
* Mid-August 1974: Muharem Kurbegovic, also known as The Alphabet Bomber, said in a message that he was going to come to Washington, D.C., and throw a nerve gas bomb at President Gerald Ford, then just ten days into his presidency. Within one day, the CIA, the U.S. Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies, working out of the White House basement, identified Kurbegovich; he was arrested on August 20. The group had identified his Yugoslav origins, using a CIA voice analysis of his tapes, with court records of the cases handled by his first targets—the judge and the police commissioners—triangulating his identity. Kurbegovic was arrested in 1974 and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1980.
* September 5, 1975: On the northern grounds of the California State Capitol in Sacramento, Lynette &quot;Squeaky&quot; Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, drew a Colt M1911 .45-caliber pistol on Ford when he reached to shake her hand in a crowd. She had four cartridges in the pistol&#x27;s magazine but none in the chamber, and as a result, the gun did not fire. She was quickly restrained by Secret Service agent Larry Buendorf. Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but was released from custody on August 14, 2009 (two years and eight months after Ford&#x27;s natural death in 2006).
* September 22, 1975: In San Francisco, California, only 17 days after Fromme&#x27;s attempt, Sara Jane Moore fired a revolver at Ford from away. A bystander, Oliver Sipple, grabbed Moore&#x27;s arm and the shot missed Ford, striking a building wall and slightly injuring taxi driver John Ludwig. Moore was tried and convicted in federal court, and sentenced to prison for life. She was paroled from a federal prison on December 31, 2007, after serving more than 30 years—one year and five days after Ford&#x27;s natural death.

The two assassination attempts on Gerald Ford in September 1975 are the only two known cases of women attempting to assassinate an American president.

===Jimmy Carter===
* May 5, 1979: Raymond Lee Harvey was an Ohio-born unemployed American drifter. He was arrested by the Secret Service after being found carrying a starter pistol with blank rounds, ten minutes before Carter was to give a speech at the Civic Center Mall in Los Angeles on May 5, 1979. Harvey had a history of mental illness, but police had to investigate his claim that he was part of a four-man operation to assassinate the president. According to Harvey, he fired seven blank rounds from the starter pistol on the hotel roof on the night of May 4 to test how much noise it would make. He claimed to have been with one of the plotters that night, whom he knew as &quot;Julio&quot;. (This man was later identified as a 21-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico, who gave the name Osvaldo Espinoza Ortiz.) At the time of his arrest, Harvey had eight spent rounds in his pocket, as well as 70 unspent blank rounds for the gun. Harvey was jailed on a $50,000 bond, given his transient status, and Ortiz was alternately reported as being held on a $100,000 bond as a material witness or held on a $50,000 bond being charged with burglary from a car. Charges against the pair were ultimately dismissed for a lack of evidence.
* John Hinckley Jr. came close to shooting Carter during his re-election campaign, but he lost his nerve. He would later attempt to kill President Ronald Reagan in March 1981.

===George H. W. Bush===

* April 13, 1993: According to Kuwaiti authorities, and an FBI investigation fourteen Kuwaiti and Iraqi men believed to be working for Saddam Hussein smuggled bombs into Kuwait, planning to assassinate former President Bush by a car bomb during his visit to Kuwait University three months after he had left office in January 1993. The former president was on a visit to Kuwait in 1993 to commemorate the coalition&#x27;s victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War when Kuwaiti officials claimed to have foiled an alleged assassination plot and arrested the suspects. At the time the former president was accompanied by his wife, two of his sons, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, former Chief of Staff John Sununu, and former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Of the 17 people Kuwaiti authorities arrested, two suspects, Wali Abdelhadi Ghazali, and Raad Abdel-Amir al-Assadi, retracted their confessions at the trial, claiming that they were coerced. A Kuwaiti court convicted all but one of the defendants. Then-president Bill Clinton responded by launching a cruise missile attack on an Iraqi intelligence building in the Mansour district of Baghdad. The plot was used as one of the justifications for the Iraq Resolution authorizing the 2003 U.S. invasion of the country. An analysis by the CIA&#x27;s Counterterrorism Center concludes the assassination plot was likely fabricated by Kuwaiti authorities; however, at the time the FBI established that the plot had been directed by the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS), and the CIA had received information suggesting that Saddam Hussein had authorized the assassination attempt to get revenge against the U.S., to punish Kuwait for working with the U.S., and to keep other Arab states for intervening in Iraq any further. The day before the attack, on April 12, 1993, the then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and future 64th U.S. secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, went before the U.N. Security Council to present evidence of the Iraqi plot with the hope of gaining international support.

===Bill Clinton===
* January 21, 1994: Ronald Gene Barbour, a retired military officer and freelance writer, plotted to kill Clinton while the president was jogging. Barbour returned to Florida a week later without having fired the shots at the president, who was on a state visit to Russia. Barbour was sentenced to five years in prison and was released in 1998.
* October 29, 1994: Francisco Martin Duran fired at least 29 shots with a 7.62×39mm SKS semi-automatic rifle at the White House from a fence overlooking the North Lawn, thinking that Clinton was among the men in dark suits standing there (Clinton was inside). Three tourists, Harry Rakosky, Ken Davis and Robert Haines, tackled Duran before he could injure anyone. Found to have a suicide note in his pocket, Duran was sentenced to 40 years in prison.
* November 1994: Osama bin Laden recruited Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, to attempt to assassinate Clinton. However, Yousef decided that security would be too effective and decided to target Pope John Paul II instead.
* November 24, 1996: During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, Clinton&#x27;s motorcade was rerouted before it was to drive over a bridge. Secret Service officers had intercepted a message suggesting that an attack was imminent, and Lewis Merletti, the director of the Secret Service, ordered the motorcade to be re-routed. An intelligence team later discovered a bomb under the bridge. Subsequent U.S. investigation &quot;revealed that [the plot] was masterminded by a Saudi terrorist living in Afghanistan named Osama bin Laden&quot;.
* October 2018: A package containing a pipe bomb addressed to his wife Hillary Clinton and sent to their home in Chappaqua, New York, was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several mailed to other Democratic leaders in the same week, including former president Barack Obama. Bill Clinton was at the Chappaqua home when the package was intercepted, while Hillary was in Florida campaigning for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Fingerprint DNA revealed that the package was sent by Florida resident Cesar Sayoc, who was captured two days after the package was intercepted. Prosecutors sought a life sentence for Sayoc, but the judge instead sentenced him to 20 years.

===George W. Bush===

* May 10, 2005: While President Bush was giving a speech in the Freedom Square in Tbilisi, Georgia, Vladimir Arutyunian threw a live Soviet-made RGD-5 hand grenade toward the podium. The grenade had its pin pulled, but did not explode because a red tartan handkerchief was wrapped tightly around it, preventing the safety lever from detaching. After escaping that day, Arutyunian was arrested in July 2005. During his arrest, he killed an Interior Ministry agent. He was convicted in January 2006 and given a life sentence.
* May 24, 2022: Shihab Ahmed Shihab Shihab, an Iraqi citizen and resident of Columbus, Ohio, was arrested for involvement in a plot to assassinate former President Bush based on information obtained from conversations he held with several undercover FBI informants. He was also accused of committing an immigration crime and planning to illegally smuggle Iraqi nationals into the U.S. from Mexico in order to assist with the plot. He additionally claimed to informants that he had direct connections to members of the former ISIS, including ones to former ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi (before his death) and a former ISIS financial chief, the latter of whom he intended to launder money from into the U.S. via a Columbus car dealership. In February, Shihab and an informant traveled to the Bush home in Dallas, Texas, and to the George W. Bush Institute to conduct surveillance. Shihab entered the country illegally in September 2020 with false identification. Shihab claimed to have worked with Iraqi terrorists to kill many American servicemen in Iraq from 2003 to 2006 following the invasion. He stated that the motivation behind the assassination plot was anger over the Iraq War.

===Barack Obama===

* December 2008: A United States Marine, 20-year-old Kody Ray Brittingham, stationed at Camp Lejeune, wrote that he had taken an oath to &quot;protect against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.&quot; In a signed &quot;letter of intent,&quot; he identified President-elect Obama as a &quot;domestic enemy&quot; and the target of Brittingham&#x27;s planned assassination plot. A search of his barracks uncovered a journal containing white supremacist material. In June 2010, Brittingham was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months in federal prison.
* April 2009: A plot to assassinate Obama at the Alliance of Civilizations summit in Istanbul, Turkey, was discovered after a man of Syrian origins carrying forged Al Jazeera TV press credentials was found. The man confessed to the Turkish security services details of his plan to kill Obama with a knife. He alleged that he had three accomplices.
* November 2011: 21-year-old Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez was influenced by conspiracy theories and fringe religious viewpoints to attempt to murder Obama. Having traveled from his native Idaho, he hit the White House with several rounds fired from a semi-automatic rifle. No one was injured, but a window was broken. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
* 2011 to 2012: The far-right terrorist group FEAR plotted to carry out a series of terror attacks which included assassinating Obama. The plot was foiled when four members of the group were arrested on murder charges and one, Michael Burnett, agreed to co-operate with authorities in return for a lighter sentence.
* October 2012: A mentally ill man named Mitchell Kusick of Westminster, Colorado, was arrested after confessing to his therapist that he intended to kill Obama with a shotgun at a campaign stop in Boulder, Colorado.
* April 2013: Another attempt was made when a letter laced with the toxin ricin was sent to Obama.
* May 2013: Ricin-laced letters were sent to Obama and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg vowing to kill anyone who tried to take away the sender&#x27;s guns. The letters in this case were sent by actress Shannon Richardson, who tried to frame her husband Nathan for the crime.
* June 2013: Two white supremacists, Glendon Scott Crawford of Galway, New York and Eric Feight of Hudson, New York, were arrested for a plot to kill Muslim Americans and other perceived enemies of Israel with a homemade &quot;radiation gun&quot;, described by Crawford as &quot;Hiroshima on a light switch&quot;. It later emerged that Crawford had suggested using the device against President Obama as well as several other targets.
* February 2015: Three men from New York City were arrested by the FBI after telling undercover agents about their plans to kill Obama and join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.
* October 2018: A package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to former President Obama at his home in Washington, D.C. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service.
* April 2019: Larry Mitchell Hopkins, a member of the United Constitutional Patriots militia, was arrested on April 20 after he allegedly confessed that his militia was training for a planned assassination of Obama and Hillary Clinton.

=== Donald Trump ===

* September 6, 2017: Gregory Lee Leingang, a 42-year-old man from Bismarck, North Dakota, attempted to assassinate President Donald Trump in Mandan, North Dakota, while Trump was visiting the state to rally public support. Leingang stole a forklift from an oil refinery and drove toward the presidential motorcade. After the forklift became jammed within the refinery, he fled on foot and was arrested by the pursuing police. While interviewed in detention, he admitted his intent to murder the president by flipping the presidential limousine with the stolen forklift, to the surprise of authorities, who suspected he was merely stealing the vehicle for personal use. The man pleaded guilty to the attempted attack, stealing the forklift, related charges, and several other unrelated crimes on the same day. Consequently, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison. His defense attorney noted a &quot;serious psychiatric crisis&quot;.
* November 2017: A man affiliated with Islamic State (IS), whose name was not revealed, was arrested by the Philippine National Police in Rizal Park, Manila, for reportedly planning to assassinate Trump during the diplomatic ASEAN Summit. In the week prior to the failed killing, the Secret Service already suspected a planned assault on the president because of the general presence of IS in the Philippines and because of threats by many people against the president on social media. Before the landing of Trump&#x27;s airplane, the Secret Service discovered a credible terrorist threat from a man who threatened to kill the president on social media, quickly tracking down and arresting the terrorist. The government disclosed the incident to the public, after a year of silence, in a television documentary.
* October 1, 2018: An envelope laced with ricin was sent to Trump before being discovered by mailing facilities. Several other letters were sent to the Pentagon, all of them labeled on the front with &quot;Jack and the Missile Bean Stock Powder&quot;. Two days later on October 3, a 39-year-old Utah Navy veteran named William Clyde Allen III was arrested and charged with one count of mailing a threat against the president and five counts of mailing threatening communications to an officer or an employee of the United States. Allen pleaded not guilty to all charges.
* September 2020: Letters containing the poison ricin and addressed to Donald Trump were intercepted by the Secret Service before delivery to the White House. Canadian woman Pascale Ferrier had sent the letters from Canada and was subsequently arrested while attempting to cross the Canadian border into the United States while possessing a firearm and ammunition. Ferrier was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the poisoned letters, which she had also sent to law enforcement officials in Texas. She described herself as a peaceful activist, claiming “The only regret I have is that it didn’t work and that I couldn’t stop Trump&quot;.
* October 2020: It was reported that Barry Croft Jr, a Delaware man who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping plot against Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, included Trump in a list of politicians he wanted to kill by hanging. In December 2022, Croft was sentenced to 19 years in prison.
* July 12, 2024: A Pakistani man named Asif Merchant, reported to be an agent of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was arrested for a plot to kill Trump at a rally in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. Merchant allegedly paid $5,000 to federal agents posing as hired assassins and told them they would receive their instructions after he had left the country.

* September 15, 2024: 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent holding an SKS-style rifle on a private golf course belonging to Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida. Routh was hiding at a place that was commonly used to take pictures of Trump (while golfing) by the media. After 12 hours of hiding in shrubbery, Routh had his weapon pointed through the fence line of the golf course, 300–500 yards away from Trump. A Secret Service agent noticed this and fired four rounds towards Routh, who then dropped his weapon and fled the scene. After a short police chase, he was stopped and detained without resistance; no one was hurt. The following day, the FBI confirmed that Routh did not fire his weapon. Routh&#x27;s trial is set to began on September 8, 2025.
* September 2024: According to a criminal complaint filed by the Department of Justice, an Iranian official had ordered agents in the US to formulate a plan to kill Trump before the election. The agents, identified as 51-year-old Farjad Shakeri, 49-year-old Carlisle Rivera, and 36-year-old Jonathon Loadholt were charged with murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and money laundering conspiracy. Shakeri was additionally charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, conspiring to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and sanctions against the Government of Iran.

===Joe Biden===
* May 22, 2023: Sai Varshith Kandula, a 19-year-old man from Chesterfield, Missouri (near St. Louis), drove a rented box truck into a barrier that separated the White House grounds from the public. Shortly thereafter he was taken into custody by the United States Park Police and was found to have a Nazi flag in his truck. Kandula expressed admiration for the Third Reich and stated his intentions were to &quot;kill the president&quot; and &quot;seize power&quot;.

==Deaths rumored to have been assassinations==

===Zachary Taylor===
On July 9, 1850, President Zachary Taylor died from an illness that was diagnosed as cholera morbus, which allegedly came after eating cherries and milk at a 4th of July celebration. Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories have persisted into the 21st century. In 1991 a neutron activation analysis conducted on samples of Taylor&#x27;s remains found no evidence of poisonings due to insufficient levels of arsenic. Marxist political scientist Michael Parenti questions the traditional explanation for Taylor&#x27;s death. Relying on interviews and reports by forensic pathologists, he argues that the procedure used to test for arsenic poisoning was fundamentally flawed.

===Warren G. Harding===

In June 1923, President Warren G. Harding set out on a cross-country Voyage of Understanding, planning to meet with citizens and explain his policies. During this trip, he became the first president to visit Alaska, which was then a U.S. territory. Rumors of corruption in the Harding administration were beginning to circulate in Washington, D.C., by 1923, and Harding was profoundly shocked by a long message he received while in Alaska, apparently detailing illegal activities by his own cabinet that were allegedly unknown to him. At the end of July, while traveling south from Alaska through British Columbia, he developed what was thought to be a severe case of food poisoning. He gave the final speech of his life to a large crowd at the University of Washington Stadium (now Husky Stadium) at the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington. A scheduled speech in Portland, Oregon, was canceled. The president&#x27;s train proceeded south to San Francisco. Upon arriving at the Palace Hotel, he developed pneumonia. Harding died in his hotel room of either a heart attack or a stroke at 7:35 PM on August 2, 1923. The formal announcement, printed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of that day, stated: &quot;A stroke of apoplexy was the cause of death.&quot; He had been ill exactly one week.

Naval physicians surmised that Harding had suffered a heart attack. The Hardings&#x27; personal medical advisor, homeopath and Surgeon General Charles E. Sawyer, disagreed with the diagnosis. His wife Florence Harding refused permission for an autopsy, which soon led to speculation that he had been the victim of a plot, possibly carried out by Florence, as he apparently had been unfaithful to her. Gaston Means, an amateur historian and gadfly, noted in his book &quot;The Strange Death of President Harding&quot; (1930) that the circumstances surrounding his death led to suspicions that he had been poisoned. A number of individuals attached to him, both personally and politically, would have welcomed Harding&#x27;s death, as they would have been disgraced in association by Means&#x27; assertion of Harding&#x27;s &quot;imminent impeachment&quot;.

<text>Metromover is a free to ride automated people mover system operated by Miami-Dade Transit in Miami, Florida, United States. Metromover serves the Downtown Miami, Brickell, Park West and Arts &amp; Entertainment District neighborhoods. Metromover connects directly with Metrorail at Government Center and Brickell stations. It also connects to Metrobus with dedicated bus loops at Government Center and Adrienne Arsht Center station. It originally began service to the Downtown/Inner Loop on April 17, 1986, and was later expanded with the Omni and Brickell Loop extensions on May 26, 1994.

The Metromover serves primarily as an alternative way to travel within the greater Downtown Miami neighborhoods. The system is composed of three loops and 21 stations. The stations are located approximately two blocks away from each other, and connect near all major buildings and places in the Downtown area. As of , the system has rides per year, or about per day in .

Out of only three downtown people movers in the United States, the other two being the Jacksonville Skyway and the Detroit People Mover, the Metromover is by far the most successful in terms of ridership, the only completed system of the three, and considered to be a catalyst for downtown development.

==History==

In 1987, the then-one-year-old people mover system set a record in daily ridership of 33,053 on a Saturday, attributed to the new Bayside Marketplace. That same year was when the planning began to extend the system to Brickell and Arts &amp; Entertainment District (then &quot;Omni&quot;), which would not be completed until 1994. Until November 2002 when the half-penny transit tax was approved, the Metromover had a fare of 25 cents. The fare was lifted because it was realized that the cost of collecting the fare nearly exceeded the revenue generated from the fare, as well as the fact that the eliminated fare would likely lead to more Metrorail ridership. After becoming free, from 2002 to 2005, along with a large increase in population, rising gas prices and booming downtown development, Metromover ridership nearly doubled from 4.7 million in 2002 to about 9 million in 2005. However, ridership fell with the subsequent economic downturn and high unemployment in the latter half of the decade. By 2012, ridership had once again increased with downtown population, high gas prices and a recovering economy. In early 2011, Metromover saw an increase in ridership during a sharp peak in gas prices, at the same time as there was a decrease in Metrorail and Metrobus ridership as well as a decrease in employment. However, from January 2010 to January 2011, Metrorail saw a 7% increase in ridership, and both Metrorail and Metromover were expected to see additional ridership increases throughout 2011 due to rising fuel prices. When the Omni and Brickell extensions were first planned, it was estimated that ridership on the fared system would reach 43,000 daily by 2000, a number the now free system has yet to reach.

== Operations ==
There are 21 accessible Metromover stations located throughout Downtown Miami and Brickell roughly every two blocks. The Metromover links all of Downtown and Brickell&#x27;s major office buildings, residential buildings, hotels, and retail centers. Major attractions such as the Stephen P. Clark Government Center, American Airlines Arena, Arsht Performing Arts Center, the Cultural Plaza (Miami Art Museum, Historical Museum of Southern Florida, Miami Main Library), Bayside Marketplace, Mary Brickell Village, Miami-Dade College, Museum Park (which services Perez Art Museum Miami as well as the Frost Science Museum) and the Brickell Financial District can all be reached by the Metromover.

Running clockwise, the Downtown (Inner) Loop serves all Downtown stations except Third Street station. The Outer Loop (Brickell and Omni Loops) runs counterclockwise and share tracks around the downtown area, serving all stations except for Miami Avenue Station. The Brickell loop runs a line into the Brickell area to the south of downtown, while the Omni Loop contains a line with stations in the Arts &amp; Entertainment District neighborhood north of Downtown. This unusual pattern, a circular central loop where the trains running counterclockwise are those running from and back to destinations outside the loop, whereas trains in the opposite clockwise direction are only running a tight inner circular route, is also followed by the New York JFK Airport AirTrain system. The inner loop generally runs tandem two car trains while the outer loops only run with single cars. Each car can carry over 90 passengers.

The Metromover car maintenance base, unusual for a maintenance yard, is a building located downtown, at SW 1st Ave and SW 1st St, which lies between Government Center and 3rd St stations on the outer counterclockwise loop, at the point where the two loops split to run in adjacent parallel streets.

All loops run from 5 am to midnight, seven days a week. This schedule is adjusted during events. Trains on the Inner Loop run in tandem and arrive every 90 seconds during rush hours and every three minutes otherwise. Outer Loop trains arrive every 5 to 6 minutes; every 2.5 to 3 minutes where the track is shared.

The cost of building the system was about $153.3 million. The operating budget for the Inner and Outer (Brickell and Omni) loops in FY 2007 was $8,888,794. Ridership total for FY 2007 was 8.7 million. Not including capital costs, this gives an approximate cost of $1.02 per ride. Metromover does not charge for rides; however, a $2.25/1.1 fee is charged if transferring to Metrorail or Metrobus.

==Stations==

The Metromover currently operates 21 stations, all within the Miami city limits.
==Rolling stock==
Metromover mainly uses 29 Bombardier Innovia APM 100 vehicles, the first 12 of which were delivered during the summer and fall of 2008. These newer vehicles replaced the first 12 Westinghouse C-100 cars which were built by Westinghouse Electric in 1984, and include a more aerodynamic design, as well as an onboard CCTV system. Deliveries of an additional 17 cars from Bombardier Transportation began in July 2010, and as of early 2014 have largely replaced the second order of 17 Adtranz C-100 vehicles, built by Adtranz predecessor AEG-Westinghouse in 1992.

==Ridership==
Sortable chart detailing monthly weekday ridership averages by Calendar Year; right hand chart giving annual averages may use &quot;fiscal year&quot; without disclosure, where the FY begins in October and has 75% of its time in the next year with only 25% in the starting year. Note the large jump in ridership in 2002 when the fare was removed after the passing of the half-penny tax. Yearly averages are rounded to the nearest 500, and the highest month is also in bold. After years of growth, Metromover ridership began falling in 2017, following years of sharp declines in Metrobus and Metrorail ridership. Ridership peaked again in early 2020 at over 30,000 per weekday before crashing during the years long covid pandemic.

==Incidents==

* On September 10, 2008, a man was trying to reach his hat that was blown off his head by a gust of wind. While doing so he was struck and killed by a Metromover car.
* On July 21, 2010, two northbound cars collided, causing minor injuries to 16 passengers.
* On February 5, 2014, a man was struck and killed at the Riverwalk Station. Witnesses reported that the man jumped in front of the approaching Metromover car.

==Expansion==
===Port of Miami===
In May 2011, a study was proposed to analyze the idea of extending the Metromover to the PortMiami. This, with Metrorail and the new MIA Mover would create a direct rail transit link from the airport to the seaport. However, the study, which would take at least a year and cost about $120,000, was only a proposal to be voted on and the idea has not been reported on since 2014.

===South Beach===
There have been multiple proposals for a Metromover service to southern Miami Beach. One was as part of the proposed Resorts World Miami megaproject in Miami&#x27;s Arts &amp; Entertainment District neighborhood, announced in mid-2011, a Metromover expansion from Downtown Miami to South Beach was being pushed as recompense for building a casino. The line could potentially run from the Arts &amp; Entertainment District across the Venetian Causeway to 17th Street in South Beach ending at the Miami Beach Convention Center. The line could have three stations in South Beach along 17th Street- Alton Road, Meridian Avenue and Washington Avenue. This would connect Miami Beach to rail mass transit for the first time, and provide a direct rail connection into one of the Miami area&#x27;s most visited neighborhoods. The line would also allow for future expansions later across South Beach. More recently, proposals for a separate, most likely at-grade, light-rail system known as BayLink have been revived.

Miami-Dade originally planned to have a monorail along the southern edge of MacArthur Causeway from Downtown Miami to South Beach. However, in November 2022, the original plan would be changed to Metromover because the budget did not allow for the proposed monorail and it would not provide a one-seat ride from Downtown Miami to South Beach.

===Northward expansion===
A county plan unveiled in March 2021 shows an extension north from the current School Board station along North Miami Avenue, connecting the system to Midtown, Wynwood, and The Design District. An infill station called Herald Plaza would also be added on the site of the former Miami Herald building, eventually connecting the Metromover system to Miami Beach.

<text>New.net was an alternative DNS root system which is enabled via NewDotNet, a DNS hijacker application, which is usually bundled with legitimate software. The top-level domains New.net provided include: .agent, .arts, .auction, .chat, .church, .club, .family, .free, .game, .golf, .inc, .law, .llc, .llp, .love, .ltd, .med, .mp3, .school, .scifi, .shop, .soc, .sport, .tech, and .video At one point it offered .travel, .kids, and .xxx but those were removed when they conflicted with domains proposed to ICANN in the first round of creation of new domain names in the primary root since the early history of the DNS. Alternate access to domains registered under New.net&#x27;s alternative TLDs is provided by third level domains under the new.net domain name space (e.g., example.shop is actually example.shop.new.net). As of early 2012, New.net seems to have ceased operation, as the web site &quot;new.net&quot; is no longer resolving; ICANN would allow official registrations of new, non-standard top-level domains the same year.

==Adware==
New.net distributed NewDotNet, an Internet Explorer plugin for Windows that enables the browser to access sites that use these unofficial domain names. It is considered as adware and spyware by McAfee Site Advisor. In a poll of readers of ICANN Watch, New.Net was considered the greatest threat to the security of the DNS as matched against other alternatives.

Several different versions of NewDotNet exist. Early versions installed themselves into the Windows directory as a DLL named &quot;newdotnet&quot; followed by a version number, and had no uninstall option. More recent versions create a folder in the Program Files folder. A version introduced in 2002 (since discontinued) included a pop-up advertising component.

The program functions by inserting itself into the Winsock system, which can in some situations disrupt network connectivity. Well-known and generally trusted anti-spyware programs like Ad-Aware and Spybot are usually effective at removing older versions of this software. More recent versions of NewDotNet can be uninstalled using the standard Windows &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; control panel or an uninstaller in &quot;C:\Program Files\New.net&quot;. Manual removal, if performed incorrectly, can completely disrupt the computer&#x27;s ability to access the internet. This can be fixed with an LSP Fix program.

==Lawsuit==
On 6 May 2003 New.net filed a federal lawsuit in the Central District Court of California against Lavasoft, distributor of Ad-Aware. Their claims against Lavasoft of false advertising, unfair competition, trade libel, and tortious interference were stricken and dismissed with prejudice the following year.

==Legal controversy==
NewDotNet has been implicated as the cause of a controversial 2007 criminal trial which received international media coverage. In State of Connecticut v. Julie Amero, a substitute teacher was arrested after students in her 7th Grade class reported that they had seen pornographic images on her computer screen. Amero said the computer would not stop sending pop-ups and that she did not know what to do with the computer.

Amero was convicted on four counts of risk of injury to a minor, or impairing the morals of a child, and faced up to 40 years in prison. The state Supreme Court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial, but Amero instead pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of disorderly conduct and had her Connecticut teaching credentials revoked. A subsequent forensic analysis revealed that the uncontrollable pornographic pop-ups were propagated by NewDotNet.

<doc id="574544" wikidata="Q715746" url="?curid=574544" title="Circular motion">
<text>In physics, circular motion is movement of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular arc. It can be uniform, with a constant rate of rotation and constant tangential speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a fixed axis of a three-dimensional body involves the circular motion of its parts. The equations of motion describe the movement of the center of mass of a body, which remains at a constant distance from the axis of rotation. In circular motion, the distance between the body and a fixed point on its surface remains the same, i.e., the body is assumed rigid. 

Examples of circular motion include: special satellite orbits around the Earth (circular orbits), a ceiling fan&#x27;s blades rotating around a hub, a stone that is tied to a rope and is being swung in circles, a car turning through a curve in a race track, an electron moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field, and a gear turning inside a mechanism.

Since the object&#x27;s velocity vector is constantly changing direction, the moving object is undergoing acceleration by a centripetal force in the direction of the center of rotation. Without this acceleration, the object would move in a straight line, according to Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.

== Uniform circular motion ==


In physics, uniform circular motion describes the motion of a body traversing a circular path at a constant speed. Since the body describes circular motion, its distance from the axis of rotation remains constant at all times. Though the body&#x27;s speed is constant, its velocity is not constant: velocity, a vector quantity, depends on both the body&#x27;s speed and its direction of travel. This changing velocity indicates the presence of an acceleration; this centripetal acceleration is of constant magnitude and directed at all times toward the axis of rotation. This acceleration is, in turn, produced by a centripetal force which is also constant in magnitude and directed toward the axis of rotation.

In the case of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body that is not negligibly small compared to the radius of the path, each particle of the body describes a uniform circular motion with the same angular velocity, but with velocity and acceleration varying with the position with respect to the axis.

=== Formula ===
For motion in a circle of radius , the circumference of the circle is . If the period for one rotation is , the angular rate of rotation, also known as angular velocity, is:
formula_1 and the units are radians/second.

The speed of the object traveling the circle is:
formula_2

The angle swept out in a time is:
formula_3

The angular acceleration, , of the particle is:
formula_4

In the case of uniform circular motion, will be zero.

The acceleration due to change in the direction is:
formula_5

The centripetal and centrifugal force can also be found using acceleration:
formula_6

The vector relationships are shown in Figure 1. The axis of rotation is shown as a vector perpendicular to the plane of the orbit and with a magnitude . The direction of is chosen using the right-hand rule. With this convention for depicting rotation, the velocity is given by a vector cross product as
formula_7
which is a vector perpendicular to both and , tangential to the orbit, and of magnitude . Likewise, the acceleration is given by
formula_8
which is a vector perpendicular to both and of magnitude and directed exactly opposite to .

In the simplest case the speed, mass, and radius are constant.

Consider a body of one kilogram, moving in a circle of radius one metre, with an angular velocity of one radian per second.
* The speed is 1 metre per second.
* The inward acceleration is 1 metre per square second, .
* It is subject to a centripetal force of 1 kilogram metre per square second, which is 1 newton.
* The momentum of the body is 1 kg·m·s−1.
* The moment of inertia is 1 kg·m2.
* The angular momentum is 1 kg·m2·s−1.
* The kinetic energy is 0.5 joule.
* The circumference of the orbit is 2 (~6.283) metres.
* The period of the motion is 2 seconds.
* The frequency is (2)−1 hertz.

==== In polar coordinates ====
During circular motion, the body moves on a curve that can be described in the polar coordinate system as a fixed distance from the center of the orbit taken as the origin, oriented at an angle from some reference direction. See Figure 4. The displacement &quot;vector&quot; formula_9 is the radial vector from the origin to the particle location:
formula_10
where formula_11 is the unit vector parallel to the radius vector at time and pointing away from the origin. It is convenient to introduce the unit vector orthogonal to formula_11 as well, namely formula_13. It is customary to orient formula_13 to point in the direction of travel along the orbit.

The velocity is the time derivative of the displacement:
formula_15

Because the radius of the circle is constant, the radial component of the velocity is zero. The unit vector formula_11 has a time-invariant magnitude of unity, so as time varies its tip always lies on a circle of unit radius, with an angle the same as the angle of formula_17. If the particle displacement rotates through an angle in time , so does formula_11, describing an arc on the unit circle of magnitude . See the unit circle at the left of Figure 4. Hence: 
formula_19
where the direction of the change must be perpendicular to formula_11 (or, in other words, along formula_13) because any change formula_22 in the direction of formula_11 would change the size of formula_11. The sign is positive because an increase in implies the object and formula_11 have moved in the direction of formula_13.
Hence the velocity becomes:
formula_27

The acceleration of the body can also be broken into radial and tangential components. The acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity:
formula_28

The time derivative of formula_13 is found the same way as for formula_11. Again, formula_13 is a unit vector and its tip traces a unit circle with an angle that is . Hence, an increase in angle by formula_17 implies formula_13 traces an arc of magnitude , and as formula_13 is orthogonal to formula_11, we have:
formula_36
where a negative sign is necessary to keep formula_13 orthogonal to formula_11. (Otherwise, the angle between formula_13 and formula_11 would &quot;decrease&quot; with an increase in .) See the unit circle at the left of Figure 4. Consequently, the acceleration is:
formula_41

The centripetal acceleration is the radial component, which is directed radially inward:
formula_42
while the tangential component changes the magnitude of the velocity: 
formula_43

==== Using complex numbers ====
Circular motion can be described using complex numbers. Let the axis be the real axis and the formula_44 axis be the imaginary axis. The position of the body can then be given as formula_45, a complex &quot;vector&quot;:
formula_46
where is the imaginary unit, and formula_47 is the argument of the complex number as a function of time, .

Since the radius is constant:
formula_48
where a &quot;dot&quot; indicates differentiation in respect of time.

With this notation, the velocity becomes: 
formula_49
and the acceleration becomes:
formula_50

The first term is opposite in direction to the displacement vector and the second is perpendicular to it, just like the earlier results shown before.

==== Velocity ====
Figure 1 illustrates velocity and acceleration vectors for uniform motion at four different points in the orbit. Because the velocity is tangent to the circular path, no two velocities point in the same direction. Although the object has a constant &quot;speed&quot;, its &quot;direction&quot; is always changing. This change in velocity is caused by an acceleration , whose magnitude is (like that of the velocity) held constant, but whose direction also is always changing. The acceleration points radially inwards (centripetally) and is perpendicular to the velocity. This acceleration is known as centripetal acceleration.

For a path of radius , when an angle is swept out, the distance traveled on the of the orbit is . Therefore, the speed of travel around the orbit is
formula_51
where the angular rate of rotation is . (By rearrangement, .) Thus, is a constant, and the velocity vector also rotates with constant magnitude , at the same angular rate .

==== Relativistic circular motion ====

In this case, the three-acceleration vector is perpendicular to the three-velocity vector, 
formula_52
and the square of proper acceleration, expressed as a scalar invariant, the same in all reference frames,
formula_53
becomes the expression for circular motion, 
formula_54
or, taking the positive square root and using the three-acceleration, we arrive at the proper acceleration for circular motion: 
formula_55

==== Acceleration ====
The left-hand circle in Figure 2 is the orbit showing the velocity vectors at two adjacent times. On the right, these two velocities are moved so their tails coincide. Because speed is constant, the velocity vectors on the right sweep out a circle as time advances. For a swept angle the change in is a vector at right angles to and of magnitude , which in turn means that the magnitude of the acceleration is given by 
formula_56

== Non-uniform circular motion ==

In non-uniform circular motion, an object moves in a circular path with varying speed. Since the speed is changing, there is tangential acceleration in addition to normal acceleration.

The net acceleration is directed towards the interior of the circle (but does not pass through its center). 

The net acceleration may be resolved into two components: tangential acceleration and centripetal acceleration. Unlike tangential acceleration, centripetal acceleration is present in both uniform and non-uniform circular motion.
In non-uniform circular motion, the normal force does not always point to the opposite direction of weight.
The normal force is actually the sum of the radial and tangential forces. The component of weight force is responsible for the tangential force (when we neglect friction). The centripetal force is due to the change in the direction of velocity.

The normal force and weight may also point in the same direction. Both forces can point downwards, yet the object will remain in a circular path without falling down. 
The normal force &quot;can&quot; point downwards. Considering that the object is a person sitting inside a plane moving in a circle, the two forces (weight and normal force) will point down only when the plane reaches the top of the circle. The reason for this is that the normal force is the sum of the tangential force and centripetal force. The tangential force is zero at the top (as no work is performed when the motion is perpendicular to the direction of force). Since weight is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object at the top of the circle and the centripetal force points downwards, the normal force will point down as well. 

From a logical standpoint, a person travelling in that plane will be upside down at the top of the circle. At that moment, the person&#x27;s seat is actually pushing down on the person, which is the normal force.

The reason why an object does not fall down when subjected to only downward forces is a simple one. Once an object is thrown into the air, there is only the downward gravitational force that acts on the object. That does not mean that once an object is thrown into the air, it will fall instantly. The velocity of the object keeps it up in the air. The first of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion states that an object&#x27;s inertia keeps it in motion; since the object in the air has a velocity, it will tend to keep moving in that direction.

A varying angular speed for an object moving in a circular path can also be achieved if the rotating body does not have a homogeneous mass distribution.

One can deduce the formulae of speed, acceleration and jerk, assuming that all the variables to depend on formula_57:
formula_58
formula_59
formula_60
formula_61
formula_62

formula_63

formula_64

Further transformations may involve formula_65 and their corresponding derivatives:
formula_66

== Applications ==
Solving applications dealing with non-uniform circular motion involves force analysis. With a uniform circular motion, the only force acting upon an object traveling in a circle is the centripetal force. In a non-uniform circular motion, there are additional forces acting on the object due to a non-zero tangential acceleration. Although there are additional forces acting upon the object, the sum of all the forces acting on the object will have to be equal to the centripetal force.
formula_67

Radial acceleration is used when calculating the total force. Tangential acceleration is not used in calculating total force because it is not responsible for keeping the object in a circular path. The only acceleration responsible for keeping an object moving in a circle is the radial acceleration. Since the sum of all forces is the centripetal force, drawing centripetal force into a free body diagram is not necessary and usually not recommended.

Using formula_68, we can draw free body diagrams to list all the forces acting on an object and then set it equal to formula_69. Afterward, we can solve for whatever is unknown (this can be mass, velocity, radius of curvature, coefficient of friction, normal force, etc.). For example, the visual above showing an object at the top of a semicircle would be expressed as formula_70.

In a uniform circular motion, the total acceleration of an object in a circular path is equal to the radial acceleration. Due to the presence of tangential acceleration in a non uniform circular motion, that does not hold true any more. To find the total acceleration of an object in a non uniform circular, find the vector sum of the tangential acceleration and the radial acceleration.
formula_71

Radial acceleration is still equal to formula_72. Tangential acceleration is simply the derivative of the speed at any given point: formula_73. This root sum of squares of separate radial and tangential accelerations is only correct for circular motion; for general motion within a plane with polar coordinates formula_74, the Coriolis term formula_75 should be added to formula_76, whereas radial acceleration then becomes formula_77.

<text>Barry University is a private Catholic university in Miami Shores, Florida. Founded in 1940 by the Adrian Dominican Sisters, it is one of the largest Catholic universities in the Southeast and is located within the Archdiocese of Miami.

The university offers more than 100 degree programs, from bachelors to doctorate, in six schools and two colleges. Barry University has more than 7,000 students, a campus of 54 buildings, a branch campus in Tallahassee, a law school in Orlando, and 50,000 alumni.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
Barry College was founded as a women&#x27;s college by a pair of siblings: Patrick Barry, Bishop of St. Augustine, and his sister, Mary Gerald Barry, OP, then prioress of the Adrian Dominican Sisters. The construction of what was then the Barry College for Women began in 1940, in what had previously been &quot;a tract of tropical vegetation&quot;. The empty lot was soon transformed into the main campus in Miami Shores, Florida. The original campus consisted of five buildings. Mother Barry served as president from 1940 to 1961.

Barry College became Barry University on November 13, 1981. Barry University continues to be sponsored by the Dominican Sisters of Adrian, Michigan. It is an independent 501(c)(3) organization and has an independent board of trustees.

=== Presidents ===

The university has had six Adrian Dominican Sisters serve as president since its inception: M. Gerald Barry, 1940–61; M. Genevieve Weber, 1962–63; M. Dorothy Browne, 1963–74; M. Trinita Flood, 1974–81; Jeanne O&#x27;Laughlin, 1981–2004; and Linda Bevilacqua, 2004–2019. Mike Allen began his tenure as the seventh president of Barry University on July 1, 2019. He is the first man and lay person to lead Barry University since its founding in 1940. The motherhouse of the sisters is in Adrian, Michigan.
=== Cor Jesu Chapel ===

The Cor Jesu (&quot;Heart of Jesus&quot;) Chapel is intended to be the spiritual and physical heart of the campus. It was financed with the aid of Margaret Brady Farrell, a parishioner of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Miami Beach. Soon after discovering that the construction of the Cor Jesu was postponed due to insufficient funds, Farrell donated all the funds needed for completion the chapel&#x27;s construction. In her honor, the Division of Business and Finance building was dedicated as &quot;Farrell House&quot;. The chapel is topped by an tower holding carillon chimes. It seats 500 persons. Traces of Romanesque architecture can be seen in the inside of the chapel which &quot;was built in choir style with wood wainscoting and a canopy over the altar&quot;. A stained-glass window of amber color, containing the image of a Celtic cross, is visible from the main entrance of the campus.

== Facilities ==
Barry University&#x27;s main campus is in Miami Shores, Florida. While the main campus is in Miami Shores, Barry University offers several continuing adult education classes at other locations in Florida. Barry University has a campus in Orlando containing the Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law.

There are more than 40 buildings at the Miami Shores campus. These contain technology laboratories and indoor and outdoor sporting facilities.

The Monsignor William Barry Memorial Library contains more than 710,000 items, including 2,600 periodical titles, 5,000 audiovisual items, 150 electronic databases, and an &quot;excellent Catholic American collection&quot;. The library also contains a collection of documents pertaining to Operation Pedro Pan.

=== Expansion ===
While Barry University is primarily a liberal arts college, the university has expanded its programs of study to include specialized programs in nursing, teacher education, medical technology, and social work.

Barry began graduate programs for men and women in 1954, a continuing education program in 1974, a school of business in 1976, a division of biological and biomedical sciences in 1983, and a school of podiatric medicine in fall 1985.

In 1999, the Barry University School of Law was established in Orlando, Florida. Barry University&#x27;s law school is named the Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law.

== Academics ==
Barry University offers more than 50 traditional undergraduate programs, accelerated bachelor&#x27;s programs designed specifically for working adults, and more than 40 graduate programs (many of these with evening/weekend classes) in 9 schools. As of 2019, student to faculty ratio was 12:1.

<text>The Bell AH-1 SuperCobra is a twin-engined attack helicopter that was developed on behalf of, and primarily operated by, the United States Marine Corps (USMC). The twin Cobra family, itself part of the larger Huey family, includes the AH-1J SeaCobra, the AH-1T Improved SeaCobra, and the AH-1W SuperCobra.

The Super Cobra was derived from the single-engined AH-1 Cobra, which had been developed during the mid-1960s as an interim gunship for the U.S. Army. The USMC had quickly taken an interest in the type, but sought a twin-engined arrangement for greater operational safety at sea, along with more capable armaments. While initially opposed by the Department of Defense, who were keen to promote commonality across the services, in May 1968, an order for an initial 49 twin-engine AH-1J SeaCobras was issued to Bell. The type entered service during the final months of the US&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, seeing limited action in the theatre as a result.

The USMC promptly sought greater payload capacity than that provided by the original Sea Cobra; thus the AH-1T, equipped with the dynamic systems of the Model 309 and a lengthened fuselage, was produced by Bell during the 1970s. In the following decade, in response to the denial of funding to procure the Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, the USMC opted to procure a more capable variant of the AH-1T; equipped with revised fire control systems compatible with new munitions, such as the AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missile, the new model, designated AH-1W, commenced delivery in 1986. Seeking to further develop the type, Bell opted to develop the extensively redesigned and modernised Bell AH-1Z Viper during the 1990s and 2000s.

The Sea Cobra was involved in multiple major operations during the latter half of the twentieth century, such as during the United States invasion of Grenada in 1983. During the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s, Iranian Sea Cobras were intensely used, proving itself to be capable in both anti-armor and anti-aircraft warfare. Turkey, who operated numerous Cobras and Super Cobras, used the type on multiple occasions against Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) insurgents. On numerous occasions in the 1990s, USMC AH-1s were deployed during the Gulf War of the early 1990s, as well as for the United States invasion of Haiti in 1994, and the US intervention in the Yugoslav Wars in the late 1990s. In the twenty-first century, the type also saw action in the multi-decade War in Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. During October 2020, the USMC withdrew the last of its AH-1Ws in favor of exclusively operating the AH-1Z.

==Design and development==

The AH-1 Cobra was developed in the mid-1960s as an interim gunship for the U.S. Army for use during the Vietnam War. The Cobra shared the proven transmission, rotor system, and the Lycoming T53 turboshaft engine of the prolific UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot; utility helicopter. By June 1967, the first AH-1G HueyCobras had been delivered. Between 1967 and 1973, Bell manufactured 1,116 AH-1Gs for the U.S. Army; these Cobras chalked up in excess of one million operational hours in the Vietnam theatre.

The U.S. Marine Corps became particularly interested in the AH-1G Cobra, but expressed its preference for a twin-engined configuration that would provide improved safety in over-water operations. Furthermore, the service also sought a more potent turret-mounted weapon. Initially, the Department of Defense had balked at providing the Marines with a twin-engine version of the Cobra in the belief that commonality with the Army&#x27;s AH-1Gs outweighed the advantages of a different engine arrangement. However, the Marines won out; thus, during May 1968, Bell received a contract for 49 twin-engine AH-1J SeaCobras. The AH-1J was also equipped with a more powerful gun turret in the form of the three-barrel 20 mm XM197 cannon, which was based on the six-barrel M61 Vulcan cannon. As an interim measure, the U.S. Army transferred 38 AH-1Gs to the Marines in 1969.

During the 1970s, the Marine Corps requested greater load carrying capability in high temperatures for the Cobra. Bell used systems from its Model 309 to develop a new model, the AH-1T, that was provisioned with a lengthened tailboom and fuselage as well as the upgraded transmission and engines from the Model 309. Bell designed the AH-1T to be more reliable and easier to maintain in the field. The version was given full TOW missile capability with targeting system and other sensors. An advanced version, known as the AH-1T+, that was equipped with more powerful T700-GE-700 engines and advanced avionics, was proposed to Iran in the late 1970s, but the overthrow of the Shah of Iran in the late 1970s resulted in the sale being canceled.
In the early 1980s, the Marine Corps sought a new navalized helicopter; accordingly, it evaluated the Boeing AH-64 Apache attack helicopter over a two-week period in September 1981, which included shipboard operation tests. Furthermore, various concepts were studied at this time. However, the service&#x27;s request for funding to purchase the AH-64 was denied by Congress that same year. As an alternative option, the Marines procured a more powerful version of the AH-1T. Other changes included modified fire control systems to carry and fire AIM-9 Sidewinder and AGM-114 Hellfire missiles. The new version, which was funded by Congress, received the AH-1W designation. During March 1986, deliveries of the AH-1W SuperCobra commenced, eventually totaling 179 new-built helicopters along with the upgrading of 43 existing AH-1Ts.
During the late 1990s, Bell was negotiating to acquire the Romanian state-managed helicopter manufacturer IAR Brașov with the intention of establishing an overseas production line for the AH-1W for multiple export customers. In May 1997, the company signed an agreement with the Romanian State Ownership Fund to buy the government&#x27;s 70 percent stake in IAR Brașov. However, during November 1999, following protracted negotiations, Bell announced that it had abandoned its acquisition efforts, and thus the overseas production initiative, after the Romanian government had allegedly ceased responding to its proposals.

The AH-1T+ demonstrator and AH-1W prototype were later tested with a new experimental composite four-blade main rotor system. The new configuration offered better performance, reduced noise, and improved battle damage tolerance. Lacking a USMC contract, Bell developed this new design into the AH-1Z with its own funds. By 1996, the Marines were again prevented from ordering the AH-64. Developing a marine version of the Apache would have been expensive and it was likely that the Marine Corps would be its only customer. Instead, the service signed a contract for the upgrading of AH-1Ws into AH-1Zs.

The Bell AH-1Z Viper retained much of the AH-1W&#x27;s design, but also features several major changes. The AH-1Z&#x27;s two redesigned wing stubs are longer with each adding a wingtip station for a missile such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder. Each wing has two other stations for 70 mm (2.75 in) Hydra rocket pods, or AGM-114 Hellfire quad missile launcher. The Longbow radar can be mounted on a wingtip station. During October 2020, the last AH-1Ws were phased out of service with the Marine Corps in favor of the AH-1Z.

==Operational history==
===United States===

During the closing months of the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War, the Marine Corps embarked the AH-1J SeaCobra assigned to HMA-369 (now HMLA-369) aboard , , and later , for sea-based interdiction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in North Vietnam in the vicinity of Hon La (Tiger) Island. These were termed Marine Hunter-Killer (MARHUK) Operations and lasted from June to December 1972. As such, the type participated in the final American combat operations in Vietnam. Several AH-1Js were present to cover the evacuation of the US Embassy in Saigon in April 1975.

During 1983, Marine Cobras took part in the invasion of Grenada. They were typically used to perform close air support and helicopter escort missions; a total of two AH-1Ts were shot down and three crew members killed. That same year, Marine AH-1s were also deployed off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, amid the Lebanese civil war in support of the Multinational Peacekeeping Force. In this theatre, the AH-1s were typically armed with Sidewinder missiles and guns, which were intended to be used as an emergency air defense measure to counter the threat of light civil aircraft being piloted by suicide bombers.

During the mid-1980s, the AH-1W variant entered service with the USMC. Between, 1986 to 1999, the service took delivery of 179 Super Cobras.

In the late 1980s, in response to the Tanker War of the wider Iran–Iraq War, USMC Cobras were dispatched for Operation Earnest Will in the Persian Gulf to escort shipping and deter attacks upon them. It was during these missions that Cobras sank three Iranian patrol boats while losing a single AH-1T to Iranian anti-aircraft fire. USMC Cobras from flew &quot;top cover&quot; during an evacuation of U.S. and other foreign citizens from Liberia in 1990.

During the Gulf War, 78 Marine SuperCobras were deployed, flying a total of 1,273 sorties in Iraq. While no combat losses were reportedly incurred, three AH-1s were lost to accidents either during and after the combat operations. The AH-1W units were credited with destroying 97 tanks, 104 armored personnel carriers and vehicles, and two anti-aircraft artillery sites during the 100-hour ground campaign.

USMC Cobras were also used in various other operations throughout the 1990s. The type provided support for the U.S. humanitarian intervention in Somalia, Operation Restore Hope, during 1992–1993. They were also employed during the U.S. invasion of Haiti during 1994. USMC Cobras were used in U.S. military interventions in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s; specifically, two AH-1Ws assisted in the rescue of USAF Captain Scott O&#x27;Grady, after his F-16 was shot down by a SAM in June 1995.

During the twenty-first century, USMC Cobras participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and in Operation Iraqi Freedom in the conflict in Iraq. While new replacement aircraft were considered as an alternative to major upgrades of the AH-1 fleet, Marine Corps studies showed that an upgrade was the most affordable, most supportable and most effective solution for the Marine Corps light attack helicopter mission.

During the opening phase of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, SuperCobras were deployed on the front lines, often flying in hunter-killer teams with Bell UH-1 Iroquois utility helicopters and other coalition aircraft. Reportedly, 46 of the 58 USMC AH-1s deployed sustained battle damage, which was mostly from infantry-type weapons. AH-1Ws were involved in the rescue of Private First Class Jessica Lynch from an Iraqi hospital.

In late August 2016, Marine AH-1W Cobras flying from started flying combat missions over Sirte, Libya against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya, providing close air support for friendly militias on the ground. In the later stages of the operation, AH-1Ws flew combat missions from the deck of after that ship replaced &quot;Wasp&quot; in October 2016.

In October 2020, the U.S. Marine Corps retired the last of its AH-1Ws after 34 years of service, having replacing the type with the Bell AH-1Z Viper. By the time of their retirement, the model had collectively accumulated 933,614 flight hours.

===Iran===
In 1971, Iran purchased 202 examples of an improved AH-1J, named &quot;AH-1J International&quot;, from the United States. This model featured improvements such as the uprated P&amp;WC T400-WV-402 engine and a strengthened drivetrain. Furthermore, recoil damping gear was fitted to the 20 mm M197 gun turret, while the gunner was provided with a stabilized sight along with a stabilized seat. Of the AH-1Js operated by the Imperial Iranian Army Aviation, 62 were capable of using the TOW missile.

Iranian AH-1Js participated in the Iran–Iraq War—which saw the most intensive use of helicopters in any conventional war. Iranian AH-1Js (particularly the TOW-capable ones) were &quot;exceptionally effective&quot; in anti-armor warfare, inflicting heavy losses on Iraqi armored and vehicle formations. In operations over the barren terrain in Khuzestan and later in southern Iraq, beside the standard tactics, Iranian pilots developed special, effective tactics, often in the same manner as the Soviets did with their Mi-24s. Due to the post-Revolution weapons sanctions, Iranians had to make do with what was at hand: they equipped the AH-1Js with AGM-65 Maverick missiles and used them with some success in several operations.

Starting from October 1980, the AH-1Js engaged in air-to-air combat with Iraqi Mil Mi-24 helicopters on several, separate occasions during the Iran–Iraq War. The results of these engagements are disputed. One document cited that Iranian AH-1Js took on Iraqi Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters. Sources report that the Iranian AH-1 pilots achieved a 10:1 kill ratio over the Iraqi helicopter pilots during these engagements (1:5). Additionally, one source states that ten Iranian AH-1Js were lost in the war, compared to six Iraqi Mi-24s lost. The skirmishes are described as fairly evenly matched in another source. The Mi-24 was faster and more powerful, but the AH-1J was more agile. There were even engagements between Iranian AH-1Js and Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft. The AH-1Js scored three confirmed kills against MiG-21s, claimed a Su-20, and shared in the destruction of a MiG-23—all using their 20 mm M197 cannon.
During early 1984, an Iranian AH-1J Sea Cobra was shot down by an Iraqi Pilatus PC-7 during Operation Kheibar (Iranian pilots Reza Moghadam and Mohammad Yazdi were rescued). About half of the AH-1Js were lost during the conflict to combat, accidents, and simple wear and tear. Ali Akbar Shiroodi and Ahmad Keshvari were two distinguished Iranian Cobra pilots during Iran-Iraq War and are considered wartime heroes in Iran. During 1988, two Soviet MiG-23s shot down a pair of Iranian AH-1Js that had strayed into western Afghan airspace.

Into the twenty-first century, Iranian AH-1Js remain in service with the Islamic Republic of Iran Army Aviation and have undergone indigenous upgrade programs. By the 2020s, there was an increasing expectation that, amid a combination of factors such as accumulated fatigue, increasingly outdated capabilities, and a shortage of spare components, Iran will probably seek to replace its AH-1Js before too long, possibly with Russian-sourced Mi-24s.

===Taiwan===
During 1984, Taiwan announced its requirement for attack helicopters; it subsequently evaluated the MBB Bo 105 and MD 500 helicopters. The requirement resulted in an order for 42 AH-1W SuperCobras being placed during 1992. Deliveries of this batch ran from 1993 to 1997. During 1997, it was announced that an additional 21 AH-1Ws had been ordered. The Ministry of National Defense assigned the helicopters to the ROC Army Aviation Training Centre and a pair of Army Aviation attack helicopter brigades. During the 2010s, Taiwan began supplementing its SuperCobras with 30 newly purchased AH-64Es. Into the 2020s, Taiwan continues to operate its SuperCobras; during January 2021, a NT$339.24 million (US$11.91 million) contract with the US was signed for the provision of technical support and spare parts the AH-1W fleet through to September 2027.

===Turkey===
During the early 1990s, Turkey bought ten AH-1W SuperCobras; these were supplemented by 32 ex-US Army AH-1 Cobras. The sale was politically controversial in the United States; in April 1996, the purchase of ten additional AH-1Ws by Turkey was blocked by the Clinton administration. During late 2011, Turkey requested the purchase of three AH-1Ws from the USMC inventory.

The AH-1s have been repeatedly used in combat against Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;PKK&quot;) insurgents. On 13 May 2016, PKK militants shot down a Turkish Army AH-1W SuperCobra using a 9K38 Igla (SA-18 Grouse) MANPADS; in the published video, the missile severed the tail section from the rest of the helicopter, causing it to spin, fragment in midair and crash, killing the two pilots on board. The Turkish government initially stated that it had descended due to technical failure, though it later became clear that the helicopter had been shot down. Amid the 2016 Turkish coup d&#x27;état attempt, Turkish Cobras were alleged to have fired upon several police vehicles.

During April 2022, all of the Turkish Army&#x27;s remaining AH-1Ws were transferred to the Turkish Navy; they are the first type of attack helicopter to be operated by the service. Being already appropriately suited to maritime operations, the AH-1Ws are to be used on board the TCG Anadolu amphibious assault ship; as such, the type has been speculated to have displaced a planned navalised version of the indigenously built TAI/AgustaWestland T129 ATAK attack helicopter.

<text>Planet Airways was an airline based in Orlando, Florida, USA which was established as Airship Airways in 1998 before being renamed with the current name in 2000. It operated charter services within the USA and to the Caribbean.

==Code data==
* ICAO Code: PLZ
* Callsign: Planet 

==History==
The company was a private venture co-founded by Peter V. Garrambone and Tony DeCamillis, which was partly funded by Lou Pearlman. Upon Garrambone&#x27;s resignation Tony DeCamillis became President &amp; CEO. The airline began in 1995 when it incorporated as &quot;Planet Airways, Inc.,&quot; a startup airline seeking FAA Part 121 certification. It acquired its first plane in 1998, was granted FAA Part 121 approval to fly charter services, and obtained FAA certification in 2000. Planet operated a fleet of 6 Boeing 727 jet aircraft for customers including the United States Marshals Service, the United States Forest Service, and the United States Department of Defense. In the fiscal year 2004, Planet Airways received nearly 10% of the total revenues awarded by the Department of Defense to all qualified US carriers for domestic charters. 

According to information in a news release distributed by Planet Holdings Corp (PHC), Planet Airways had agreed to be acquired by the business development firm. The PHC acquisition was created as an alternative means to provide capital to modernize Planet&#x27;s aging fleet, beginning with the replacement of two recently retired aircraft. PHC had already completed a funding with Sierra Aircraft Leasing specifically to facilitate the acquisition of Planet&#x27;s first two Boeing 757 aircraft.

The PHC acquisition of Planet was terminated by Planet in January 2005. DeCamillis learned that the principal operator of PHC, Kevin James Quinn, had been disbarred as an attorney in California and was also banned by the SEC from participating in public offerings. DeCamillis reported Quinn&#x27;s violation to the Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s Division of Enforcement and cancelled PHC&#x27;s planned acquisition of Planet. Pearlman, who had introduced Quinn, became adversarial and DeCamillis subsequently resigned as Chief Executive Officer of the airline. That same year, under Pearlman and his new management team, the airline ceased flight operations in mid-2005.

On September 30, 2020, The Secretary of Communications and Transport known as SCT on behalf of the Mexican Government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador notified the beginning of the legal abandonment process to whoever legally own one of the planes that was left behind in the International Mariano Matamoros Airport of Morelos State, located in Temixco near the Morelos&#x27;s Capital Cuernavaca, Mexico. They notified to whoever owned the plane to remove it from the airport, this is done in efforts of the government to set order in all the airports nearby Ciudad de Mexico.

On June 17, 2021, The Mexican Government expropriated the plane left behind in International Mariano Matamoros Airport of Morelos State and notified the legal movement through the Federal Civil Aviation Agency, that they would take claim of the abandoned plane. The plane is registered with plate number XA-UII and it is Boeing 727-222 model, records for the plate show it was sold to Pan Am Air Cargo in 2007 but the plane physically is still painted as Planet Airways, the plane historically began flying in 1968 where it started under United Airlines Cargo.

==Department of Defense Civil Reserve Air Fleet==
Planet Airways was a Department of Defense Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) qualified air carrier until the cessation of operations in 2005. The United States Air Force describes the CRAF as non-military air carriers that meet the strict qualifications and requirements to operate on behalf of the DOD in emergencies when the need for airlift exceeds the capability of military aircraft. As a CRAF airline Planet Airways operated domestic flights transporting US military personnel on a regular basis.

Planet Airways prepared for several years to meet Department of Defense standards, which are described as follows:

:&quot;Safety is the paramount concern, and numerous procedures are in effect to ensure that the air carriers with which AMC contracts afford the highest level of safety to DOD passengers. Prior to receiving a contract, all carriers must demonstrate that they have provided substantially equivalent and comparable commercial service for one year before submitting their offer to fly for the Defense Department. All carriers must be fully certified Federal Aviation Administration carriers and meet the stringent standards of Federal Aviation Regulations pertaining to commercial airlines (Part 121).&quot;

:“A DOD survey team, composed of experienced AMC pilots and skilled maintenance personnel, performs an on-site inspection of the carriers. This team conducts a comprehensive inspection that includes carrier&#x27;s aircraft, training facilities, crew qualifications, maintenance procedures, quality control practices and financial status to maximize the likelihood that the carrier would safely perform for DOD. After passing this survey, the carrier is certified by the Commercial Airlift Review Board as DOD-approved before receiving a contract.”

:“AMC analysts then continue to monitor the carrier&#x27;s safety record, operations and maintenance status, contract performance, financial condition and management initiatives, summarizing significant trends in a comprehensive review every six months. In addition to this in-depth review, there are several other surveillance initiatives. These include safety preflight inspections of commercial aircraft by DOD designated inspectors, periodic cockpit observations on operational flights by highly experienced pilots from AMC&#x27;s DOD Commercial Airlift Division, and an increase in the frequency of on-site surveys. These initiatives and the surveys are further supplemented by an open flow of information on all contract carriers between AMC and the FAA through established liaison officers.”

In fiscal year 2004 Planet Airways received nearly 10% of the total revenues awarded by the Department of Defense for domestic charter flights transporting U.S. military personnel.

==Fleet==
Throughout most of the company&#x27;s history Planet owned and operated a fleet of seven (7) Boeing jet aircraft consisting of six Boeing 727-200s and one Boeing 727-100. As of January 2005 the Planet Airways fleet included:

*5 – Boeing 727-100/200

<doc id="574566" wikidata="Q1970420" url="?curid=574566" title="Simple file verification">
<text>Simple file verification (SFV) is a file format for storing CRC32 checksums of files to verify the integrity of files. SFV is used to verify that a file has not been corrupted, but it does not otherwise verify the file&#x27;s authenticity. The codice_1 file extension is usually used for SFV files.

== Checksum ==
Files can become corrupted for a variety of reasons, including faulty storage media, errors in transmission, write errors during copying or moving, and software bugs. SFV verification ensures that a file has not been corrupted by comparing the file&#x27;s CRC hash value to a previously calculated value. Due to the nature of hash functions, hash collisions may result in false positives, but the likelihood of collisions is usually negligible with random corruption. (The number of possible checksums is limited though large, so that with any checksum scheme many files will have the same checksum. However, the probability of a corrupted file having the same checksum as its original is exceedingly small, unless deliberately constructed to maintain the checksum.)

SFV cannot be used to verify the authenticity of files, as CRC32 is not a collision resistant hash function; even if the hash sum file is not tampered with, it is computationally trivial for an attacker to cause deliberate hash collisions, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a hash comparison. In cryptography, this attack is called a collision attack. For this reason, the md5sum and sha1sum utilities are often preferred in Unix operating systems, which use the MD5 and SHA-1 cryptographic hash functions respectively.

Even a single-bit error causes both SFV&#x27;s CRC and md5sum&#x27;s cryptographic hash to fail, requiring the entire file to be re-fetched.
The Parchive and rsync utilities are often preferred for verifying that a file has not been accidentally corrupted in transmission, since they can correct common small errors with a much shorter download.

Despite the weaknesses of the SFV format, it is popular due to the relatively small amount of time taken by SFV utilities to calculate the CRC32 checksums when compared to the time taken to calculate cryptographic hashes such as MD5 or SHA-1.

SFV uses a plain text file containing one line for each file and its checksum in the format &quot;FILENAME&lt;whitespaces&gt;CHECKSUM&quot;. Any line starting with a semicolon &#x27;;&#x27; is considered to be a comment and is ignored for the purposes of file verification. The delimiter between the filename and checksum is always one or several spaces; tabs are never used. A sample SFV file is:

 ; This is a comment
 file_one.zip c45ad668
 file_two.zip 7903b8e6
 file_three.zip e99a65fb

=== Command-line utility ===
An example of an open-source cross-platform command-line utility that outputs crc32 checksums is 7-Zip.

Many Linux distributions include a simple command-line tool codice_2 to verify the checksums.

<doc id="574570" wikidata="Q13409250" url="?curid=574570" title="Aerial lift">
<text>An aerial lift, also known as a cable car or ropeway, is a means of cable transport in which &quot;cabins&quot;, &quot;cars&quot;, &quot;gondolas&quot;, or open chairs are hauled above the ground by means of one or more cables. Aerial lift systems are frequently employed in a mountainous territory where roads are relatively difficult to build and use, and have seen extensive use in mining. Aerial lift systems are relatively easy to move and have been used to cross rivers and ravines. In more recent times, the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of aerial lifts have seen an increase of gondola lift being integrated into urban public transport systems.

==Types==
===Cable car===

A cable car (British English) or an aerial tramway, aerial tram (American English), uses one or two stationary ropes for support while a separate moving rope provides propulsion. The grip of an aerial tramway is permanently fixed onto the propulsion rope. Aerial trams used for urban transport include the Roosevelt Island Tramway in New York City, as well as the Portland Aerial Tram.
===Gondola lift===

A gondola lift consists of a continuously circulating cable that is strung between two or more stations, over intermediate supporting towers. The cable is driven by a bullwheel in a terminal, which is connected to an engine or electric motor. Multiple gondola cabins are attached to the cable, usually with detachable grips, enabling them to slow down in the stations to facilitate safe boarding. Fixed grip variants exist, although these are considerably less common. Lifts with a single cable are sometimes referred to as &quot;mono-cable&quot; gondola lifts. Depending on the design of the individual lift, the capacity, cost, and functionality of a gondola lift will differ dramatically. Because of the proliferation of such systems in the Alpine regions of Europe, the French language name of télécabine is also used in an English language context. Gondola lifts are also used for urban transportation. Examples include the Singapore Cable Car, Metrocable (Medellín), Metrocable (Caracas), Mi Teleférico (La Paz), and London Cable Car.
====Bicable and tricable gondola lifts====

Gondola lifts which feature one stationary &#x27;support&#x27; rope and one haul rope are known as bi-cable gondola lifts, while lifts that feature two support ropes and one haul rope are known as tri-cable gondola lifts. Examples include Ngong Ping Skyrail (Hong Kong) and the Peak 2 Peak Gondola (Canada).
===Funitel===

A funitel differs from a standard gondola lift through the use of two overhead arms, attached to two parallel haul cables, providing more stability in high winds. The name &quot;funitel&quot; is a blend of the French words &quot;funiculaire&quot; and &quot;telepherique&quot;. Systems may sometimes be referred to as &quot;double monocable&quot; (DMC), where two separate haul cables are used, or &quot;double loop monocable&quot; (DLM) where a single haul cable is looped round twice.

Funitels combine a short time between successive cabins with a high capacity (20 to 30 people) per cabin.
===Funifor===

A funifor is a type of cable car with two support ropes and a haul rope, looped around. Each system is composed of a single cabin shuttling back-and-forth. Many installations are built with two parallel, but independent, lines. The funifor design was developed by the Italian manufacturer, Hölzl, which later merged with Doppelmayr Italia. Today, the design is therefore patented by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.

At the top of each track, the haul rope loops back to the bottom instead of looping over to serve the other track, as would occur with a normal aerial tramway. This is shown in the diagram below. This feature allows for a single cabin operation when traffic warrants. The independent drive also allows for evacuations to occur by means of a bridge connection between adjacent cabins.

The main advantage of the funifor system is its stability in high wind conditions owing to the horizontal distance between the two support ropes.
===Chairlift===

Chairlifts are continuously circulating systems carrying chairs, which usually enable skiers to board without removing skis. They are a common type of lift at most ski areas and in mountainous areas. They can also be found at some amusement parks and tourist attractions.
Detachable chairlifts usually move far faster than fixed-grip chairlifts, typically compared with . Because the cable moves faster than most passengers could safely disembark and load, each chair is connected to the cable by a powerful spring-loaded cable grip which detaches at terminals, allowing the chair to slow considerably for convenient loading and unloading at a typical speed of , a speed slower even than fixed-grip. Chairs may be fitted with a &quot;bubble&quot; canopy to offer weather protection.
=== Hybrid lift ===

A hybrid lift is a fusion of a gondola lift and a chair lift. The company Leitner refers to it as telemix, while Doppelmayr uses the term combination lift. An example is Ski Arlberg&#x27;s &quot;Weibermahd&quot; lift in Vorarlberg (Austria) which alternates between 8-person chairlifts and 10-person gondolas.
=== Hand-powered ===
In undeveloped areas with rough terrain, simple hand-powered cable-cars may be used for crossing rivers, such as the &quot;tuin&quot; used in Nepal.
==Material ropeways==
A material ropeway or ropeway conveyor is an aerial lift from which containers for goods rather than passenger cars are suspended. These are usually monocable or bicable gondola lifts.

Material ropeways are typically found around large mining concerns, and can be of considerable length. The COMILOG Cableway, which ran from Moanda in Gabon to Mbinda in the Republic of the Congo, was over 75 km in length. The Norsjö aerial tramway in Sweden had a length of 96 kilometers.

<doc id="574576" wikidata="Q644154" url="?curid=574576" title="Suisun Bay">
<text>Suisun Bay ( ; Wintun for &quot;where the west wind blows&quot;) is a shallow tidal estuary (a northeastern extension of the San Francisco Bay) in Northern California. It lies at the confluence of the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, forming the entrance to the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, an inverted river delta. To the west, Suisun Bay is drained by the Carquinez Strait, which connects to San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of San Francisco Bay. Grizzly Bay forms a northern extension of Suisun Bay. Suisun Bay is between Contra Costa County to the south and Solano County to the north.

The bay was named in 1811, after the Suisunes, a Patwin tribe of Wintun Indians.

The Central Pacific Railroad built a train ferry that operated between Benicia and Port Costa, California, from 1879 to 1930. The ferry boats &quot;Solano&quot; and &quot;Contra Costa&quot; were removed from service when the nearby Martinez railroad bridge was completed in 1930. From 1913 until 1954 the Sacramento Northern Railway, an electrified interurban line, crossed Suisun Bay with the &quot;Ramon&quot;, a distillate-powered train ferry.

On April 28, 2004, a petroleum pipeline operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ruptured, initially reported as spilling 1,500 barrels (264m³) of diesel fuel in the marshes, but, this was later updated to about 2,950 barrels. Kinder Morgan pleaded guilty to operating a corroded pipeline (and cited for failing to notify authorities quickly after the spill was discovered) and paid three million dollars in penalties and restitution.

==Geography==


==Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet==
The bay was the anchorage of the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, a part of the US Navy Mothball or Ghost Fleet, a collection of U.S. Navy and merchant reserve ships which was created in the period following World War II. The &quot;USNS Glomar Explorer&quot; was anchored here after recovering parts of a sunken Soviet submarine in the mid-1970s (see Project Azorian). Many ships were removed and sold for scrap in the 1990s. In 2010, plans were announced to remove the oldest remaining parts of the Suisun Bay mothball fleet in stages. The last of the 57 ships in the old Mothball Fleet were removed in August 2017. There are still a number of naval ships in Suisun Bay. Most are part of the Military Sealift Command Ready Reserve Fleet.

<text>Hans Georg Conried Jr. (April 15, 1917 – January 5, 1982) was an American actor and comedian. He was known for providing the voices of George Darling and Captain Hook in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), Snidely Whiplash in Jay Ward&#x27;s &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; cartoons, Professor Waldo P. Wigglesworth in Ward&#x27;s &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot; cartoons, was host of Ward&#x27;s live-action &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot; show and Professor Kropotkin on the radio and film versions of &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;. He also appeared as Uncle Tonoose on Danny Thomas&#x27; sitcom &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;, twice on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, and as the Mad Hatter along with Daws Butler, Dolores Starr, Stanley Adams, Francis Condie Baxter and Cheryl Callaway in &quot;The Alphabet Conspiracy&quot; (1959).

==Early life==
Conried was born on April 15, 1917, in Baltimore, Maryland, to parents Edith Beryl (née Gildersleeve) and Hans Georg Conried. His Connecticut-born mother was a descendant of Pilgrims, and his father was a Jewish immigrant from Vienna, Austria. He was raised in Baltimore and in New York City.

==Career==
Conried studied acting at Columbia University and went on to play major classical roles onstage. This led him into radio in 1937, when he appeared in a supporting role in a broadcast of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; on KECA in Los Angeles, California. Four years later, a newspaper reported about his role on &quot;Hedda Hopper&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;: &quot;But at the mike, he&#x27;s equally convincing as old men, drunks, dialeticians, or Shakesperean tragedians. Miss Hopper favors him for her dramatizations when the script will allow him, as she puts it, &#x27;to have his head.&#x27;&quot; 
Impressed with Conried&#x27;s versatility, a scout for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer signed him as a character player in 1938.

Conried&#x27;s early screen roles were incidental bits, usually comic but sometimes shady or cowardly, depending on the context. He stayed with MGM until 1941, then began freelancing. His first major featured role was at Columbia Pictures as a worldly, architectural visionary who disrupted the household in &quot;Blondie&#x27;s Blessed Event&quot; (1942). That established him as a comic figure in feature films. His Germanic surname got him cast as enemy agents in many wartime films, and he became a dialect specialist.

During World War II, Conried enlisted in the U.S. Army in September 1944. He trained at Fort Knox as a tank crewman until the army decided he was too tall. He became a heavy mortar crewman then was sent to the Philippines as an engineer laborer until fellow actor Jack Kruschen obtained his release for service with the Armed Forces Radio Network.

Conried remained active in radio during the 1940s and 1950s. He was in the regular cast of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot;, for which he wrote the December 14, 1942, episode, &quot;War Workers&quot;. On &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, he played a psychiatrist whom George regularly consults for help in dealing with the ditzy Gracie.
Conried was also a regular on the CBS Radio program &quot;Life with Luigi&quot;, portraying Schultz, a German classmate. He also played occasional dialect roles on CBS&#x27;s detective series &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot;.

Even as a younger man, Conried appeared much older than his actual age and he was frequently cast as middle-aged or even elderly pompous, scholarly types. His impeccable diction and inimitable growl were well suited to the roles he played, whether portraying the dim Professor Kropotkin on the radio show &quot;My Friend Irma&quot; or as comic villains and mock-sinister or cranky types. In 1949, while filming the movie version of &quot;My Friend Irma&quot;, character actor Felix Bressart, cast as Professor Kropotkin, died suddenly during production. Conried, who played Kropotkin on radio, stepped in to finish the picture. Most of the finished film features Bressart with Conried&#x27;s voice overdubbed; Conried appears in a few scenes in identical costume and makeup, with his voice used throughout.

Hans Conried&#x27;s first leading film role was the independent science fiction comedy &quot;The Twonky&quot; in 1953. Two years later, Conried appeared as a riverboat gambler in &quot;Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier&quot;.

==Dr. Seuss==
Theodor Geisel, better known as children&#x27;s author Dr. Seuss, was preparing a documentary feature largely made up of captured Japanese newsreel footage, &quot;Design for Death&quot; (1948). Geisel hired actor Kent Smith as the &quot;American&quot; narrator, and Hans Conried as the &quot;Japanese&quot; narrator. The film won an Academy Award.

Geisel remembered Conried when he was preparing an expensive Technicolor fantasy, &quot;The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.&quot; (1953), which included the dominant role of a demanding, dictatorial piano teacher. Conried was cast as the foreboding &quot;Dr. Terwilliker&quot; and turned in a bravura performance that might have changed his career. Unfortunately, the film was a costly failure. In 1970, Conried reflected on the film&#x27;s poor box-office take in an interview with Leonard Maltin: &quot;The picture never made its print money back. It was comparable only to &quot;Wilson&quot; as one of the great money-losers of all time; it would stop conversation for some years at any Hollywood social gathering.&quot;

The film&#x27;s financial failure didn&#x27;t affect Conried&#x27;s working relationship with Geisel, who went on to cast him in three Dr. Seuss television specials, including the 1977 Halloween TV special &quot;Halloween is Grinch Night&quot;, produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. Conried voiced both the Narrator and the Grinch, a role originated in 1966 by Boris Karloff in &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. In 1981, Conried was set to reprise his role as the Grinch for &quot;The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat&quot;, but he was in poor health and died early in 1982. Voice actor Bob Holt took over the role.

==Cartoons==
Conried&#x27;s colorful voice gained him much work in animated cartoons, such as Disney and Jay Ward. His prominent work for Disney was in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; as both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling (following the tradition of having both characters portrayed by the same actor). He then went on to pose live-action reference and audition for Aurora&#x27;s father, King Stefan, in another Disney animated film, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, but the voice role of Stefan was officially taken by Taylor Holmes for the film&#x27;s final cut. Nevertheless, Conried hosted several episodes of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; as the Magic Mirror from &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.

He supplied the storybook narration for MGM&#x27;s &quot;Johann Mouse&quot;, the 1952 Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, the seventh and last Oscar given to a &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; short.

Conried also became a charter member of the Jay Ward-Bill Scott stock company. He voiced the character of Snidely Whiplash in the Dudley Do-Right segments of &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, and Professor Waldo P. Wigglesworth on &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot;. 

Ward and Scott also cast him as the live-action host of &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot;, a wildly satirical, tongue-in-cheek redub of silent movies. During that show he had a tightly scripted segment where he absurdly interviewed guest stars and celebrities, while usually mistaking their identities, misunderstanding answers, taking umbrage or getting into mock disagreements. 

He also voiced Wally Walrus on &quot;The Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; and Dr. Dred on &quot;Drak Pack&quot;. According to the DVD commentary of &quot;Futurama&quot;, he was the inspiration for the voice created for Robot Devil.

==Television==

From 1955 to 1964, Conried made 19 guest appearances as &quot;Uncle Tonoose&quot; in &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; on ABC and then CBS, and four appearances as other characters.

He was featured in the 1958 episode, &quot;What Makes Opera Grand?&quot;, on the anthology series &quot;Omnibus&quot;. The episode, an analysis by Leonard Bernstein, showing the powerful effect of music in opera, featured Conried as Marcello in a spoken dramatization of Act III of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot;. The program demonstrated the effect of the music in &quot;La Bohème&quot; by having actors speak portions of the libretto in English, followed by opera singers singing the same lines in the original Italian.

Conried was a regular guest on Jack Paar&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; from 1959 to 1962. He was a regular panelist on the pantomime program &quot;Stump the Stars&quot; and a semi-regular guest on the Ernie Kovacs-hosted game show &quot;Take a Good Look&quot;.

In 1977, Conried joined the cast for the second and final season of &quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot; in the recurring role of Judge Franklin&#x27;s irascible father, Wyatt.

His many guest appearances included &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;Davy Crockett&quot;, &quot;The Californians&quot;, &quot;Hey, Jeannie!&quot;, &quot;The Ray Milland Show&quot;, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, &quot;Mister Ed&quot;, &quot;The Islanders&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Daniel Boone&quot;, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and &quot;Quark&quot;. On &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, he appeared in two episodes as the confused pilot Wrong Way Feldman, one of the show&#x27;s few recurring characters.
===Stage appearances===
Conried made his Broadway debut in the Cole Porter musical &quot;Can-Can,&quot; where he played a struggling artist and sang two musical numbers. In 1971, he appeared in &quot;70, Girls, 70&quot; and two years later was a replacement performer in the revival of &quot;Irene&quot; starring Debbie Reynolds.

==Personal life==
Conried married Margaret Grant on January 29, 1942; they had four children.

==Death==
Conried had a long history of heart problems and had a stroke in 1974 and a mild heart attack in 1979. He remained active until his death on January 5, 1982, one day after suffering a major heart attack. His body was donated to medical science.

<text>Hans Folke &quot;Hasse&quot; Alfredson (28 June 1931 – 10 September 2017) was a Swedish actor, film director, writer, and comedian. He was born in Malmö, Sweden. He is known for his collaboration with Tage Danielsson as the duo Hasse &amp; Tage and their production company AB Svenska Ord (&quot;Swedish Words Ltd&quot;). His most celebrated contribution to their brand of &quot;humorist humanism&quot; was his ability to extemporize wildly absurd comic situations, for example in the Lindeman dialogues.

Towards the end of his life, Alfredson made it clear that he preferred his real name, Hans, over the commonly used nickname &quot;Hasse&quot;.

He was the father of directors Daniel and Tomas Alfredson.

==Career==

Through his collaboration with Danielsson, with whom he produced several revue shows and films, Alfredson became one of Sweden&#x27;s best-known comedians and a major, enduringly popular celebrity. Already in 1970, however, he performed a less sympathetic role in Grisjakten. Later in his life, Alfredson would more or less completely turn around to become an author and director of serious, non-comedic works. In 1982 he directed and starred as the antagonist in the film The Simple-Minded Murderer, based on his novel &quot;En ond man&quot; (&quot;An Evil Man&quot;). With just a brief return to revue comedy in 1984, he rarely revisited the genre after the 1985 death of Tage Danielsson. In addition to shows and movies, he authored numerous books, including Monty Python-style comedies as well as tragic and melancholy works.

Between 1992 and 1994, Alfredson was head of the open-air museum Skansen in Stockholm.

In the mid-00s, Alfredson participated in the Danish TV series The Eagle. His last cinematic work was the 2009 adaption of Stieg Larsson&#x27;s novel The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets&#x27; Nest, directed by his son Daniel Alfredson.

==Awards==

His work, alone and with Danielsson, won several awards. At the 11th Guldbagge Awards, he won the Best Director award for his 1975 film &quot;Egg! Egg! A Hardboiled Story&quot;. His 1981 film &quot;The Simple-Minded Murderer&quot; won three awards at the 18th Guldbagge Awards and was entered into the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival. His 1985 film &quot;False as Water&quot; won the award for Best Director at the 21st Guldbagge Awards.

<text>The Rolls-Royce Olympus (originally the Bristol B.E.10 Olympus) was the world&#x27;s second two-spool axial-flow turbojet aircraft engine design, first run in May 1950 and preceded only by the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57, first-run in January 1950. It is best known as the powerplant of the Avro Vulcan and later models in the Concorde SST.

The design dates to a November 1946 proposal by Bristol Aeroplane Company for a jet-powered bomber, powered by four new engines which would be supplied by Bristol Aero Engines. Although their bomber design was ultimately cancelled in favour of the other V bombers, the engine design&#x27;s use of twin-spool layout led to continued interest from the Air Ministry and continued development funding. The engine first ran in 1950 and quickly outperformed its design goals.

Initially used in the Vulcan, later versions added reheat for use in the supersonic BAC TSR-2. Bristol Aero Engines merged with Armstrong Siddeley Motors in 1959 to form Bristol Siddeley Engines Limited (BSEL), which in turn was taken over by Rolls-Royce in 1966. Through this period the engine was further developed as the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 for Concorde.

Versions of the engine were licensed to Curtiss-Wright in the US as the TJ-32 or J67 (military designation) and the TJ-38 &#x27;Zephyr&#x27;, although none saw use. The Olympus was also developed with success as marine and industrial gas turbines, which were highly successful. As of 2018, the Olympus remains in service as both a marine and industrial gas turbine.

==Background==

===Origins===

At the end of World War II, the Bristol Engine Company&#x27;s major effort was the development of the Hercules and Centaurus radial piston engines. By the end of 1946, the company had only 10 hours of turbojet experience with a small experimental engine called the Phoebus which was the gas generator or core of the Proteus turboprop then in development. In early 1947, the parent Bristol Aeroplane Company submitted a proposal for a medium-range bomber to the same specification B.35/46 which led to the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor. The Bristol design was the Type 172 and was to be powered by four or six Bristol engines of thrust to the Ministry engine specification TE.1/46.

The thrust required of the new engine, then designated B.E.10 (later Olympus), would initially be with growth potential to . The pressure ratio would be an unheard of 9:1. To achieve this, the initial design used a low-pressure (LP) axial compressor and a high-pressure (HP) centrifugal compressor, each being driven by its own single-stage turbine. This two-spool design eliminated the need for features such as variable inlet guide vanes (Avon, J79), inlet ramps (J65), variable stators (J79) or compressor bleed (Avon) which were required on single spool compressors with pressure ratios above about 6:1. Without these features an engine could not be started nor run at low speeds without destructive blade vibrations. Nor could they accelerate to high speeds with fast acceleration times (&quot;spool up&quot;) without surge. The design was progressively modified and the centrifugal HP compressor was replaced by an axial HP compressor. This reduced the diameter of the new engine to the design specification of . The Bristol Type 172 was cancelled though development continued for the Avro Vulcan and other projects.

===Initial development===
The first engine, its development designation being BOl.1 (Bristol Olympus 1), had six LP compressor stages and eight HP stages, each driven by a single-stage turbine. The combustion system was novel in that ten connected flame tubes were housed within a cannular system: a hybrid of separate flame cans and a true annular system. Separate combustion cans would have exceeded the diameter beyond the design limit, and a true annular system was considered too advanced.

In 1950, Dr (later Sir) Stanley Hooker was appointed as Chief Engineer of Bristol Aero Engines.

The BOl.1 first ran on 16 May 1950 and was designed to produce thrust and to be free from destructive rotating stall on start up to idle speed and to be free from surging on fast accelerations to maximum thrust. The engine started without a problem and Hooker, supervising the first test run and displaying the confidence he had in the design, slammed the throttle to give a surge-free acceleration to maximum power. The thrustmeter showed . The next development was the BOl.1/2 which produced thrust in December 1950. Examples of the similar BOl.1/2A were constructed for US manufacturer Curtiss-Wright which had bought a licence for developing the engine as the TJ-32 or J67 for the projected F-102. The somewhat revised BOl.1/2B, ran in December 1951 producing thrust.

The engine was by now ready for air testing and the first flight engines, designated Olympus Mk 99, were fitted into a Canberra &quot;WD952&quot; which first flew with these engines derated to thrust in August 1952. In May 1953, this aircraft reached a world record altitude of . Fitted with more powerful Mk 102 engines, the Canberra increased the record to in August 1955. The first production Olympus, the Mk 101, entered service in late 1952 at a rated thrust of 11,000 lb, a weight of 3,650 lb, and with a TBO of 250 hours.

==Variants==
The Olympus was developed extensively throughout its production run, and the many variants can be described as belonging to four main groups.

Initial non-reheat variants were designed and produced by Bristol Aero Engines and Bristol Siddeley and powered the subsonic Avro Vulcan. These engines were further developed by Rolls-Royce Limited.

The first reheat variant, the Bristol Siddeley Olympus Mk 320, powered the cancelled BAC TSR-2 supersonic strike aircraft. For Concorde, this was developed during the 1960s into the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593, being further developed through several subsequent versions to eventually provide reliable airline service. The Olympus 593 is a prime example of &quot;propulsion and airframe integration&quot;. To optimise the performance of the engine when used at speeds from takeoff up to Mach 2 on Concorde, a variable intake and a variable throat nozzle with thrust reversing system were developed. Looking ahead to future supersonic transports, due to noise limits for supersonic transport category airplanes, studies were conducted on ejector suppressors, leading to the conclusion that &quot;a new, low bypass ratio version of the 593 could be suitable for future generations of supersonic transport aircraft&quot;.

The American Curtiss-Wright company tested a license-developed version known as the J67 and a turboprop designated TJ-38 Zephyr. Neither design was produced.

Further derivatives of the Olympus were produced for ship propulsion and land-based power generation.

<text>KIO (KDE Input/Output) is a system library incorporated into KDE Frameworks and KDE Software Compilation 4. It provides access to files, web sites and other resources through a single consistent API. Applications, such as Konqueror and Dolphin, which are written using this framework, can operate on files stored on remote servers in exactly the same way as they operate on those stored locally, effectively making KDE network-transparent. This allows for an application like Konqueror to be both a file manager as well as a web browser.

KIO Slaves (renamed to KIO Workers during the development of KDE Frameworks 6
are libraries that provide support for individual protocols (e.g. WebDAV, FTP, SMB, SSH, FISH, SFTP, SVN, TAR).

The KDE manual app KHelpCenter has a &quot;KIOSlaves&quot; (&quot;KIOWorkers&quot; in Frameworks 6) section that lists the available protocols with a short description of each.

<doc id="574595" wikidata="Q463393" url="?curid=574595" title="American Association (1882–1891)">
<text>The American Association of Base Ball Clubs (AA) was a professional baseball league that existed for 10 seasons from to . Together with the National League (NL), founded in , the AA participated in an early version of the World Series seven times versus the champion of the NL in an interleague championship playoff tournament. At the end of its run, several AA franchises joined the NL. After 1891, the NL existed alone, with each season&#x27;s champions being awarded the Temple Cup (1894–1897).

During its existence, the AA was often simply referred to as &quot;the Association&quot; in the media, in contrast to the NL, which was sometimes called &quot;the League&quot;. It was also sometimes called the &quot;Beer and Whiskey League&quot;. 

==History==

The American Association (AA) distinguished itself in several ways from what it considered to be the puritanical National League (NL). The new league established teams in what the NL leaders pejoratively called &quot;river cities&quot;, including Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville and St. Louis, with the inherent implication of lower morality or social standards in those cities. In contrast to the NL, the AA offered cheaper ticket prices, Sunday games and alcoholic beverages to its patrons. 

On November 8, 1881, at the Gibson House in Cincinnati, it was decided that individual teams in the league-to-be would operate their own affairs and set their own admission prices, under an agreement called the &quot;guarantee system&quot;. The NL at that time prohibited the sale of alcohol on its grounds, while the AA had no such restrictions, especially as several of its teams were backed by breweries and distilleries. The AA became known as &quot;The Beer and Whiskey League&quot;, another pejorative term applied by NL owners, which did not seem to bother the fans of the Association&#x27;s clubs.

Beginning in 1884 and continuing through 1890, the champion of the AA met the champion of the NL in an early version of the World Series. These early Series were less organized than the modern version, with as few as three games played and as many as fifteen, and the contests of 1885 and 1890 ending in disputed ties. The NL won four of these Series, while the AA won only one, in 1886 when the St. Louis Browns (now the St. Louis Cardinals) defeated the Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs).
Over its lifetime, the AA was weakened by several factors. One was the tendency of some of its teams to jump to the NL. The consistently stronger NL was in better position to survive adverse conditions. Some owners of AA teams also owned a NL team. The most significant blow to the AA was dealt by the Players&#x27; League, a third major league formed in 1890, which siphoned off talent and gate receipts. In a rare historical oddity, the Brooklyn Bridegrooms (now the Los Angeles Dodgers) won the league&#x27;s championship and represented the AA in the 1889 World Series, switched to the NL during the off-season, and then repeated the same feat. Though during the initial offseason between 1891 and 1892, the Association was looking to expand (including the approval of a Chicago-based team on October 23), the league formally dissolved on December 18, 1891 at 11:10 AM, having officially merged with the National League (with the new formal name, the &quot;National League and American Association of Baseball Clubs&quot;.

No player who spent the majority of his career in the AA is in the baseball Hall of Fame, although Bid McPhee of the Cincinnati Reds played eight of his eighteen seasons in the AA before the Reds moved to the National League. The living legacy of the old Association is the group of teams that came over to the National League to stay. The Pirates moved to the NL after the 1886 season, the Bridegrooms/Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds after the 1889 season, and the Browns/Cardinals after the American Association folded following the 1891 season. Following the reorganization and contraction of the NL from 12 teams down to 8 in 1900, half of the eight surviving teams were former members of the AA. Several of the AA&#x27;s home-field venues survived into the 1960s: The ballpark used by the 1891 Washington club evolved into Griffith Stadium; the home of the St. Louis Browns, Sportsman&#x27;s Park; and the city block occupied by the Reds, which evolved into Crosley Field. Other than the clubs themselves, Crosley Field was the last physical remnant of the AA—it was the home field of the Cincinnati Reds until mid-season 1970 and was razed in April 1972.

During the AA&#x27;s existence, several teams defected over to the NL, and at the AA&#x27;s demise in 1891 four additional clubs joined the NL. From 1892 to 1899, when the NL consisted of 12 teams, 7 of them had been former AA clubs. Four former AA clubs, the Pittsburgh Pirates (defected to the NL in 1887), the Cincinnati Reds (defected to the NL in 1889), the Los Angeles Dodgers (defected in 1890) and the St. Louis Cardinals (joined the NL after the AA demise in 1891), have posted more than 10,000 all-time major-league victories.

AA statistics are recognized by Major League Baseball (MLB), the AA being one of six leagues deemed &quot;major&quot; by the Special Baseball Records Committee of Major League Baseball in 1969.

<doc id="574596" wikidata="Q2867334" url="?curid=574596" title="American Association (1902–1997)">
<text>The American Association (AA) was a Minor League Baseball league that operated primarily in the Midwestern and South Central United States from 1902 to 1962 and 1969 to 1997. It was classified as a Triple-A league, which is one grade below Major League Baseball, for most of its existence.

A league champion was determined at the end of every season. The Louisville Colonels won 15 American Association titles, the most in the league&#x27;s history, followed by the Indianapolis Indians (12) and the Columbus Red Birds (10).

Intermittently throughout its history, the American Association champion competed against the champion of the International League, which operated in the Eastern U.S., to determine an overall Triple-A champion. On rare occasions, the champion of the West Coast-based Pacific Coast League also participated. The first such meetings were called the Little World Series. Later, the teams would also compete in the Junior World Series, Triple-A World Series, and Triple-A Classic. Additional interleague play consisted of the regular season&#x27;s Triple-A Alliance and Triple-A All-Star Game.

==History==
===First run (1902–1962)===
The American Association was formed in the fall of 1901 by Thomas J. Hickey, who had recently been appointed president of the Western League and was a founder of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues. Hickey resigned from the Western League to lead the new American Association, which elected not to join the National Association, thus becoming an &quot;outlaw&quot; league. The eight-team circuit fielded clubs in Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Kansas City, Missouri; Louisville, Kentucky; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Saint Paul, Minnesota; and Toledo, Ohio. The league&#x27;s inaugural 140-game schedule was to be played from late April to late September 1902. At the end of that season, the first American Association championship was won by the Indianapolis Indians.

The American Association became members of the National Association after two seasons and was then classified as a Class A circuit. In 1912, it was reclassified as a Double-A league. Through the first 12 years of play, the AA established itself as one of the premier minor leagues in the country. Its teams, featuring former major league players and top minor leaguers, were both competitive and profitable.

In 1914, the newly-formed Federal League placed teams in Indianapolis and Kansas City as well as other locals near American Association teams. One of only a few franchise shifts in the first incarnation of the AA occurred in 1914 when the Toledo Mud Hens moved to Cleveland, Ohio, as the Cleveland Bearcats. Looking to keep the Federal League out of Cleveland, which would have been in direct competition with his American League franchise, owner Charles Somers brought in his Toledo team to share League Park with the Cleveland Naps. The club returned to Toledo two seasons later after the dissolution of the Federal League. The outbreak of World War I brought further difficulties. A 1917 44-game interleague schedule with the International League was called off before Opening Day. In 1918, following a federal government mandate that men of draft age, such as the AA&#x27;s players, would be eligible for the draft, the league cancelled the rest of the season on July 21. The league resumed play after the war, in 1919, and continued to be a successful venture despite the decade&#x27;s problems.

Much like other professional sports at the time, the 1920s were a golden age for the American Association. The league drew record crowds that witnessed fast-paced games usually dominated by offence. This success, as well as its forthcoming innovations, positioned the AA to fare well during the Great Depression. On June 9, 1930, the league&#x27;s first night game was played in Indianapolis as the Indians defeated the St. Paul Saints, 1–0, at Washington Park. Its first All-Star Game was played in 1934. The Minneapolis Millers, who were in first place at midseason, beat the league&#x27;s stars, 13–6.

Until 1931, the league champions were simply the regular season pennant winners. In 1932, the first playoffs were introduced for determining champions. The league was divided into two divisions with the top team in each division meeting in a best-of-seven series to determine a winner. The Columbus Red Birds beat the Minneapolis Millers, four games to two, for the first AA playoff championship. The system was utilized again in 1933, but abandoned when Columbus again bested Minneapolis and advanced to play in the Junior World Series despite the Millers having the best record. No playoffs were held in 1935. In 1936, the league adopted the Shaughnessy playoff system in which the top four teams qualified for postseason play. The AA would still recognize a pennant winner, but the playoff champion would represent the league at the Junior World Series and be the recipient of a Governors&#x27; Cup. In the semi-finals, Indianapolis ousted St. Paul, and the Milwaukee Brewers swept the Kansas City Blues. The Brewers went on to defeat the Indians, four games to one.

Unlike other minor leagues, the American Association survived the 1930s as the only circuit to play its full season schedule without stoppage, reducing its membership, or any teams disbanding. As with other leagues, it suffered from low attendance and a lesser quality of play during World War II, but quickly returned to a period of prosperity after the war. In 1946, the AA was reclassified again, this time as a Triple-A league.

During the 1948 season, Brooklyn Dodger Roy Campanella was reassigned to the Saint Paul Saints. On May 18, he become the first person to break the color barrier in the American Association when he took the field in a game.

The American Association&#x27;s attendance base began to be eroded significantly in the 1950s and early 1960s due to expansion and westward migration of Major League Baseball teams into several of the AA&#x27;s larger member cities, especially Milwaukee, Kansas City, and Minneapolis-Saint Paul. Another contributing factor was the increased frequency of televised games, both of MLB teams and the AA&#x27;s own clubs, enticing fans to watch baseball from the comfort of their own homes. Toledo suffered such poor attendance that the team folded during the 1952 season and was transferred to Charleston, West Virginia. In 1952, the league lost the Milwaukee Brewers who were displaced by the National League&#x27;s Milwaukee Braves. In 1959, the league expanded to 10 teams when it acquired three former Texas League clubs, but expensive and lengthy travel across the spread-out league coupled with dwindling attendance was damaging to what had once been a flourishing circuit. By 1961, the league had been reduced to six clubs—just one a charter city—after having lost Kansas City and Minneapolis–St. Paul to the major leagues.

After the 1962 season, the American Association disbanded, and some of its member teams were distributed between the Pacific Coast League (PCL) and the International League (IL), while others (the Louisville Colonels and Omaha Dodgers) folded altogether. The Indianapolis Indians joined the IL, and the Dallas-Fort Worth Rangers, Denver Bears, and Oklahoma City 89ers went to the PCL.

===Second run (1969–1997)===
With major league expansion in 1969 and the need for four new Triple-A farm teams, the American Association was revived. The creation of a third Triple-A league would alleviate some of the travel costs incurred by having only two leagues spread out across the country. The new American Association would field six teams in 1969. It re-acquired its old Indianapolis; Denver, Colorado; and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, territories from the PCL, revived the Omaha, Nebraska, franchise, and added two cities (Des Moines, Iowa, and Tulsa, Oklahoma) that were new to the circuit. The teams played a 140-game schedule with no All-Star Game or playoffs. In 1970, the AA returned to a two-division format, reintroduced the All-Star Game and playoffs, and expanded to eight cities with the addition of Wichita, Kansas, and Evansville, Indiana.

The 1970s were a stable time for the Association with strong attendance and only minor franchise shifts. The league thrived during the 1980s and 1990s, along with all of Minor League Baseball as an industry. Affordable ticket prices, exciting giveaways and promotions, and new ballparks helped lure fans, especially families, back to minor league games. Half of the top-ten drawing minor league clubs in 1985 were members of the American Association. From 1982 to 1986, the Louisville Redbirds led all of Minor League Baseball in attendance, including the 1983 season in which the club drew over one million fans.

From 1988 to 1991, the Association participated in interleague play with the International League as a part of the Triple-A Alliance. The two leagues played an interlocking schedule consisting of 40 to 44 interleague games per team. At the end of each season, an Alliance champion was determined in the Triple-A Classic, a best-of-seven postseason series. All three Triple-A leagues, began participating in the Triple-A All-Star Game in 1988. The first of these events was held at the Buffalo Bisons&#x27; newly-constructed Pilot Field on July 13, 1988. In the inaugural game, a team of American League-affiliated All-Stars defeated a team of National League affiliates, 2–1. High attendance in Buffalo and across the league helped the Association draw over 3.6 million fans in both 1988 and 1989, the highest ever recorded by a minor league.

The further expansion of Major League Baseball in 1998 spurred the re-alignment of the Triple-A classification from three leagues to two. The American Association disbanded for the second time following the 1997 season. The league&#x27;s final championship was won by the Buffalo Bisons, who still possess the trophy. The AA&#x27;s teams were again distributed to the remaining leagues for the 1998 season. The Iowa Cubs, Nashville Sounds, New Orleans Zephyrs, Oklahoma City 89ers, and Omaha Royals joined an enlarged, 16-team Pacific Coast League. The Buffalo Bisons, Indianapolis Indians and Louisville Redbirds became part of an expanded, 14-team International League.

==Interleague play==
On and off, the American Association champion played against the International League&#x27;s champion in a postseason series similar to Major League Baseball&#x27;s World Series. The first Little World Series, as it was called from 1904 to 1931, saw the IL&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons defeat the AA&#x27;s St. Paul Saints, 2–1. The series was held again in 1906 and 1907, but not played again until 1917. Due to the war, there was no series in 1918, but it was revived in 1919 and then played steadily through 1931. The 1919 event was named the Junior World Series, which became the official name of the series in 1932, and pitted the AA&#x27;s champion against the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s champion. The Junior World Series, with the AA versus the IL, continued from 1932 to 1962, and was held sporadically thereafter (1970, 1971, 1973, and 1975). American Association teams won 27 Little/Junior World Series. All three Triple-A leagues participated in the 1983 Triple-A World Series. As part of the Triple-A Alliance, the AA and IL champions met in the Triple-A Classic from 1988 to 1991. All four Classics were won by Association teams.

From 1988 until the league&#x27;s demise in 1997, players from all three Triple-A leagues were selected to play in the mid-season Triple-A All-Star Game. One team was made up of All-Stars from American League affiliates and the other of National League affiliates.

==Champions==
League champions were determined by different means over the American Association&#x27;s 90 years of competition. From 1902 to 1931, the league champions were simply the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular season. The first playoffs for determining champions were held in 1933. The Louisville Colonels won 15 American Association titles, the most in the league&#x27;s history, followed by the Indianapolis Indians (12) and the Columbus Red Birds (10).

==Awards==
The American Association regularly honored outstanding players and team personnel at the end of each season.

===MVP Award===

The Most Valuable Player Award, introduced in 1929, was given to recognize the best player in the league. The first MVP Award went to shortstop Billy Rogell of the St. Paul Saints. The final award was given to outfielder Magglio Ordóñez of the Nashville Sounds.

===Most Valuable Pitcher Award===

The Most Valuable Pitcher Award, introduced in 1969, was given to recognize the best pitcher in the league. The first award was given to right-hander Sal Campisi of the Tulsa Oilers. The final award went to right-hander Rick Helling of the Oklahoma City 89ers in 1996. No winner was selected in 1997.

===Rookie of the Year Award===

The Rookie of the Year Award, introduced in 1946, was given to the best rookie player in the league. The first award was presented to first baseman Jerry Witte of the Toledo Mud Hens. The final award was given to outfielder and league MVP Magglio Ordóñez of the Nashville Sounds.

===Manager of the Year Award===

The Manager of the Year Award, introduced in 1945, was given to honor the best manager in the league. The first award went to George Selkirk of the Toledo Sox. The final award was issued to Dave Miley of the Indianapolis Indians.

<doc id="574602" wikidata="Q1044843" url="?curid=574602" title="Carquinez Strait">
<text>The Carquinez Strait (; Spanish: &quot;Estrecho de Carquinez&quot;) is a narrow tidal strait located in the Bay Area of Northern California, United States. It is part of the tidal estuary of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin rivers as they drain into the San Francisco Bay. The strait is long and connects Suisun Bay, which receives the waters of the combined rivers, with San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of the San Francisco Bay.

The strait formed in prehistoric times, near the close of one of the past ice ages, when the Central Valley was a vast inland lake. Melting ice from the Sierra Nevada raised the water level while seismic activity created a new outlet to the Pacific Ocean, draining the lake into the ocean and exposing the valley floors.

==Etymology==
The strait is named after the Karkin people ( in Spanish), a linguistic division of the Ohlone indigenous peoples who once resided on both sides of the strait.

==History==

Andrei Sarna-Wojcicki, a geologist emeritus of the US Geological Survey (USGS), estimates that the Carquinez Strait was likely formed about 640,000 to 700,000 years ago, while much of modern California was emerging from an ice age. The present Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley were covered by a huge lake (now extinct), which has been called Lake Corcoran. Initially, this lake drained into the ocean through a valley near present-day Monterey. However, ongoing seismic activity raised the coastal mountains sufficiently to plug this outlet. Concurrently, ice melting off the Sierras raised the water level in Lake Corcoran until the lake began to carve a new outlet to the ocean. At some point, the coastal barrier collapsed between today&#x27;s cities of Crockett and Benicia, releasing lake water in a cataclysmic flood.

The strait forms part of the county border between Solano (to the north) and Contra Costa (to the south), and it is approximately 15 mi (25 km) north of Oakland. The cities of Benicia and Vallejo lie on the north side of the strait, while Martinez, Port Costa, and Crockett sit on the southern coast. The Napa River joins the strait, via the short Mare Island Strait, near its entrance into San Pablo Bay. Its watershed covers , approximately 40 percent of California&#x27;s total surface.

==Installations==
The California Maritime Academy is at the western end of the strait on the northern waterfront. The C&amp;H Sugar refinery is located on the southern shore in the small town of Crockett.

==Bridges and Ferries==

The strait is crossed by two highway bridges: the Carquinez Bridge on Interstate 80 and the Benicia–Martinez Bridge on Interstate 680. Each highway bridge consists of two spans.

Interstate 780 connects the two highways on the northern slope of the strait. State Route 4 connects these highways south of and inland from the strait.

A rail bridge just east of the Benicia–Martinez Bridge is used by the Capitol Corridor, California Zephyr, and Coast Starlight trains. 

A rail ferry, with the ferries &quot;Contra Costa&quot; and &quot;Solano&quot; provided service across the strait from 1878 near the location of the current rail bridge until the rail bridge was built in 1930.

Tall pylons carrying power lines cross the strait as well. The Carquinez Strait Powerline Crossing was the world&#x27;s first powerline crossing of a large river.

==Ship traffic==
The channel is navigable and is used for commercial and military shipping. Deep water ship traffic bound for both the Port of Sacramento and the Port of Stockton traverse the strait through the Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel and Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. Carquinez Strait is part of the Baldwin Deepwater Shipping Channel.

==Formation of delta==

The narrow gap in the Coast Range that forms the strait has led to the formation of the San Joaquin–Sacramento River Delta, an inverted river delta, upstream of it, a rare geological feature. The strait is too small to allow the passage of huge amounts of floodwaters created during years with heavy rainfall or snowmelt events. Because the Delta area is the first to fill and last to drain in a flood event, silt and soil have more time to drop out of suspension, creating the inverted river delta feature.

==Saltwater intrusion==
Seawater is more dense than fresh water because of its higher concentration of salts. Under stable conditions, this means that an invisible boundary forms where two such streams meet, as where the fresh water from Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet the sea water contained in the San Francisco Bay.

By the early 20th century, farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, who depended on irrigating their fields with fresh water from the two rivers noticed an increase in salinity farther inland than before. It became obvious that fresh water was being pumped out of the Delta faster than it could be replenished by rain and snow during the wet season. Farmers, businessmen and politicians complained that allowing fresh water to flow to the ocean was wasteful. While many solutions were proposed, few appeared practical. A political consensus formed that damming the Carquinez Strait should solve the seawater intrusion problem.

In September 1923, the California Legislature appropriated $10,000 (equivalent to $ today) for a saltwater dam survey. The Federal government added a $20,000 contribution ($ today) through the US Reclamation Service. Under Reclamation Service rules, another $10,000 needed to be raised from local supporters of the project. The necessary money was raised by March 1924, and the first of three site surveys was announced.

The first survey was at Army Point, near Benicia, which was the preferred site based on preliminary studies. The second choice was Dillon Point, near Southampton Bay, while the third survey was at Point San Pablo, near Richmond. The three surveys were completed by the end of 1924. However, it took four years to complete the decision-making process that officially named Army Point as the future dam site. Still more wrangling in the legislature was required before the &quot;Salt Water Barrier&quot; was officially adopted in May 1929, and made part of the state water conservation project.

On January 24, 1930, with the Great Depression taking hold, President Herbert Hoover cancelled the Carquinez Strait project, saying that it was too costly. All efforts to revive the project failed. Years later, the Central Valley Project attempted to mitigate the effects of seawater intrusion by constructing other dams much farther inland and canals to send fresh water to the San Joaquin Valley.

<doc id="574608" wikidata="Q4246681" url="?curid=574608" title="Culture of Buddhism">
<text>Buddhist culture is exemplified through Buddhist art, Buddhist architecture, Buddhist music and Buddhist cuisine. As Buddhism expanded from the Indian subcontinent it adopted artistic and cultural elements of host countries in other parts of Asia.

==Features==

Economics, or the way in which work life is organized and the demands of production are met, form an integral part of any culture, including Buddhist culture. Buddhist Economics does not work to maximum consumption but human well-being, which lies in a simple, purposeful and dutiful life, in which rightful livelihood is earned. Human beings must remain true to their heritage and avoid materialistic pursuit. Mechanical and redundant work that deprives the soul of meaningful pursuit is looked down upon, while too much leisure also is not approved of. Women becoming part of the active workforce is considered failure of the economic system, as women have to leave looking after the children to indulge in economic way-fare, while the children are untended for.
Like language, religion has also divided the people of South Asia. The major religions in the subcontinent are Hinduism, Islam, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Strong Indian, Chinese, Burmese and other Southeast Asian influences are still evident in traditional Thai culture. Buddhism, Animism and Westernization also play a significant role in shaping the culture. Three major forces have influenced the development of Buddhism in Thailand. The most visible influence is that of the Theravada school of Buddhism, imported from Sri Lanka. ... The second major influence on Thai Buddhism is Hindu beliefs received from Cambodia, particularly during the Sukhothai Kingdom.

=== In healthcare ===
For Buddhism, mental health is of supreme importance, and individuals must strive towards improving this by practicing non-violence and refraining from sexual misconduct and lying. However, Buddhist traditions do acknowledge physical ill-being. Pain and suffering are inevitable like death, for which taking any form of medication are not prohibited. The medicines taken should not be intoxicating or affect the clarity of mind in any way. Any physical ill-being must be endured with patience and steadfastness, as any form of physical suffering allows time for self-reflection and spiritual progress. The best way to cure a disease is to improve one&#x27;s diet by practicing vegetarianism, reflective of the non-violent way of living. Buddhism also lays great stress on fasting on special days which helps revitalize the physical and spiritual being. Any form of organ transplant has been viewed as a supreme form of generosity as well.

===In art===

&quot;Buddhist art&quot; originated in the Indian subcontinent in the centuries following the life of the historical Gautama Buddha in the 6th to 5th century BCE, before evolving through its contact with other cultures and its diffusion through the rest of Asia and the world.
A first, essentially Indian, &quot;aniconic phase&quot; (avoiding direct representations of the Buddha), was followed from around the 1st century CE by an &quot;iconic phase&quot; (with direct representations of the Buddha). From that time, Buddhist art diversified and evolved as it adapted to the new countries where the faith was expanding. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism almost disappeared around the 10th century with the expansion of Hinduism and Islam.

In the earliest form of Buddhist art, the Buddha was not represented in human form but instead was represented using signs and symbols such as footprints or an empty throne. From the fifth century B.C. to the first century B.C., Indian artists would make scriptures which revolved around the themes of the historical life of the Buddha and the previous lives of the Buddha. The reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), is believed to be connected 70 Buddha&#x27;s sayings that disfavoured representations of himself after the extinction of his body. This phase is defined as the aniconic phase of Buddhist art. The iconic phase starts from the 1st century CE whereby the Buddha was given realistic human features and proportions.

===In architecture===
&quot;Buddhist religious architecture&quot; most notably developed in South Asia in the third century BCE.

Two types of structures are associated with early Buddhism: stupas and viharas. The initial function of a stupa was the veneration and safe-guarding of the relics of the Buddha. The earliest existing example of a stupa is in Sanchi (Madhya Pradesh). In accordance with changes in religious practice, stupas were gradually incorporated into chaitya-grihas (stupa halls). These reached their highpoint in the first century BCE, exemplified by the cave complexes of Ajanta and Ellora (Maharashtra). Viharas were developed to accommodate the growing and increasingly formalised Buddhist monasticism. An existing example is at Nālandā, (Bihar).

The beginnings of the Buddhist school of architecture can be traced back to B.C. 255 when the Mauryan emperor Asoka established Buddhism as the state religion of his large empire and encouraged the use of architectural monuments to spread Buddhism in different places.

Buddhism, which is also the first Indian religion to require large communal and monastic spaces, inspired three types of architecture; the first is the stupa, a significant object in Buddhist art and architecture. The Stupas hold the most important place among all the earliest Buddhist sculptures. On a very basic level, the Stupa is a burial mound for the Buddha. The original stupas contained the Buddha&#x27;s ashes. Stupas are dome-shaped monuments, used to house Buddhists&#x27; relics or to commemorate significant facts of Buddhism.

The second type of architecture unique to Buddhism is the &quot;Vihara&quot;, a Buddhist monastery that also contains a residence hall for the monks. The third type is the &quot;chaitya&quot;, an assembly hall that contains a stupa (without relics). The central hall of the &quot;chaitya&quot; is arranged to allow for circumambulation of the stupa within it.

===In music and chant===

&quot;Buddhist music&quot; prominently includes Honkyoku, Buddhist chant, and Shomyo. Honkyoku are the pieces of shakuhachiyoku for enlightenment and alms as early as the 13th century.

Buddhist chant is the chant used in or inspired by Buddhism, including many genres in many cultures. It includes:
* Paritta chanting, practice of reciting certain scriptural verses in Theravada Buddhism 
* Repetition of the name of Amitābha in Pure Land Buddhism.
* Shomyo in Japanese Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.
* Throat singing in Tibetan Buddhist chant (one aspect of Tibetan Buddhist music)

Musical chanting, most often in Tibetan or Sanskrit, is an integral part of the religion. These chants are complex, often recitations of sacred texts or in celebration of various festivals. Yang chanting, performed without metrical timing, is accompanied by resonant drums and low, sustained syllables.

Shomyo (声明) is a style of Japanese Buddhist chant; mainly in the Tendai and Shingon sects. There are two styles: ryokyoku and rikkyoku, described as difficult and easy to remember, respectively.

Many ritual musical instruments are used in association with Buddhist practice including singing bowls, bells, tingsha, drums, cymbals, wind instruments and others.

The relationship between Buddhism and music is thought to be complicated since the association of music with earthly desires led early Buddhists to condemn the musical practice, and even observation of musical performance, for monks and nuns. However, in Pure Land Buddhism Buddhist paradises are represented as musical places in which Buddhist law takes the form of melodies. Most Buddhist practices also involve chant in some form, and some also make use of instrumental music and even dance. Music can act as an offering to the Buddha, as a means of memorizing Buddhist texts, and as a form of personal cultivation or meditation.

In order to purify the hearts of listeners, Buddhist melodies are strong yet soft and pure. Buddhist music plays a central role in everyday cultural practices of Buddhists since it is also played in many ceremonies such as weddings and funerals

Buddhist music developed when Buddhism spread to Tibet. The Tibetan traditions of Buddhism encouraged the use of song and dance in certain ceremonies. A wide variety of instruments such as specialized types of drums, windpipes, spiral conches, and trumpets were used in larger ceremonies.

Hymns are commonly used in the Buddhist culture in ceremonies for making offerings or inviting the presence of Buddha and Bodhisattvas. Buddhist hymns express the five virtuous qualities that are sincerity, elegance, clarity, depth, and equanimity and it is believed that regularly listening to Buddhist hymns or fanbei can give the following five graces: a reduction in physical fatigue, less confusion and forgetfulness, a reduction in mental fatigue, greater eloquence, and greater ease in expression and communication. Therefore, in the practice of Buddhism, hymns or fanbei have an important role in daily living, for example in repentance ceremonies. They are not designed to try to elevate or excite the emotions of participants or practitioners, but in fact aim to help conserve emotional energy, calm the thinking, lessen desire, and allow practitioners to see their true nature with clarity.

===In cuisine===
Buddhist cuisine is a kind of cuisine mainly for the believers of Buddhism. It is known as zhāi cài (&quot;zhāi&quot; means &quot;purification&quot; or &quot;discipline&quot;, &quot;cai&quot; means &quot;cuisine&quot; or &quot;vegetable&quot;) in China, and shōjin ryōri (&quot;shōjin&quot; means &quot;devotion&quot;, &quot;ryōri&quot; means &quot;cuisine&quot;) in Japan, and by many other names in other countries. Due to the understanding of animals as conscious and suffering beings, many Buddhists do not kill animals and many also do not eat meat (other than that from those who died naturally, and from species where the consumption of brethren is not troubling to the still living). Certain major Mahayana sutras show the Buddha forcefully denouncing meat-consumption and advocating vegetarianism (vegetarianism in Buddhism). Buddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared wheat gluten, also known as &quot;seitan&quot; or &quot;wheat meat&quot;, soy (such as tofu or tempeh), agar, and other plant products. Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined meat analogues in the world.

Buddhism forbids alcohol and other intoxicants because they may result in violations of others of the &quot;Five Moral Precepts&quot;: no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying or partaking of intoxicants. In addition, intoxicants cloud the mind and interfere with the concentration needed to achieve enlightenment.

Some Mahāyāna Buddhists and sects in China and Vietnam avoid eating onions, garlic, scallions, chives and leeks, which are known as &quot;wu hun&quot; (五葷, &#x27;Five Spices&#x27;). The spices are said to lead to anger (raw) and passion (cooked), and their odour is also said to repel Gods and attract hungry ghosts and demons.

===In festivals===
Japanese festivals and Barua festivals often involve Buddhist culture, as do pagoda festivals held as fairs held at Buddhist temples in Myanmar. Features of Buddhist Tibetan festivals may include the traditional cham dance, which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in India and Bhutan. Many festivals of Nepal are religious festivals involving Buddhism, as are many Burmese traditional festivals. Lunar New Year festivals of Buddhist countries in East, South and Southeast Asia include some aspects of Buddhist culture, however they are considered cultural festivals as opposed to religious ones.

<text>James Francis McHugh (July 10, 1894 – May 23, 1969) was an American composer. One of the most prolific songwriters from the 1920s to the 1950s, he is credited with over 500 songs. His songs were recorded by many artists, including Chet Baker, June Christy, Bing Crosby, Marlene Dietrich, Deanna Durbin, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Adelaide Hall, Billie Holiday, Beverly Kenney, Bill Kenny, The Everly Brothers, Peggy Lee, Carmen Miranda, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra, and Dinah Washington.

==Career==
McHugh began his career in his hometown of Boston, Massachusetts, United States, where he published about a dozen songs with local publishers. His first success was with the World War I song &quot;Keep the Love-Light Burning in the Window Till the Boys Come Marching Home&quot;, and this also came near the start of a decade-long collaboration with lyricist Jack Caddigan. After struggling in a variety of jobs, including rehearsal pianist for the Boston Opera House and pianist-song plugger for Irving Berlin&#x27;s publishing company, in 1921, at the age of 26, McHugh relocated to New York City. Eventually finding employment as a professional manager with the music publisher Jack Mills Inc., it was there that McHugh published his first real hit, &quot;Emaline&quot;, and briefly teamed up with Irving Mills as The Hotsy Totsy Boys to write the hit song &quot;Everything Is Hotsy Totsy Now&quot;.

This songwriting partnership marked another of McHugh&#x27;s many collaborations, among them Ted Koehler (&quot;I&#x27;m Shooting High&quot;), Al Dubin (&quot;South American Way&quot;) and Harold Adamson (&quot;It&#x27;s a Most Unusual Day&quot;). As impressive as these master lyricists were, perhaps McHugh&#x27;s best symbiotic musical relationship was with the school teacher and poet Dorothy Fields. Since he had written material for many of Harlem&#x27;s Cotton Club revues, it would be no coincidence that their first combined success would be the score for the all-black Broadway musical, &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot;,
 starring Adelaide Hall and Bill Bojangles Robinson, which jump-started the fledgling duo&#x27;s career with the songs &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love&quot;, &quot;Diga Diga Doo&quot;, and &quot;I Must Have That Man&quot;. 
Other hits written for the stage were soon to follow, including 1930&#x27;s &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; for Lew Leslie&#x27;s &quot;International Revue&quot;, which also contained the favorite &quot;Exactly Like You&quot;; &quot;Blue Again&quot; for &quot;The Vanderbilt Revue&quot;; and in 1932, &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot;, which was featured in the Chicago revue &quot;Clowns In Clover&quot;. Some authors say that Fats Waller was the composer of &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street,&quot; but sold the rights to the song.
McHugh and Fields contributed title songs for films including &quot;Cuban Love Song&quot;, &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; and &quot;Hooray for Love&quot;, as well as &quot;I Feel a Song Comin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot; from 1935&#x27;s &quot;Every Night at Eight&quot;. In the artistically fruitful years after they first collaborated in 1930, McHugh and Fields wrote over 30 songs for the film world. Fields and McHugh finally parted company in 1935. McHugh&#x27;s longest songwriting partner was Harold Adamson. Adamson provided lyrics to McHugh&#x27;s compositions. Such hits as &quot;Comin&#x27; In on a Wing and a Prayer&quot; found its way into &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;.

For the 1948 film &quot;A Date with Judy&quot;, he composed &quot;It&#x27;s a Most Unusual Day&quot; for Jane Powell. It became the young singer and actress&#x27;s signature tune.

McHugh was the manager of Mamie Van Doren during the early part of her career. Van Doren stated in her autobiography that she was unable to get signed to Paramount due to Louella Parsons being jealous of McHugh and Van Doren. However, McHugh was able to get Van Doren signed to Universal in 1953. 

McHugh died in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 74.

Jimmy McHugh was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>The Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion is a heavy lift helicopter operated by the United States military. As the Sikorsky S-80, it was developed from the CH-53 Sea Stallion, mainly by adding a third engine, adding a seventh blade to the main rotor, and canting the tail rotor 20°. It was built by Sikorsky Aircraft for the United States Marine Corps. Developed in the 1970s, it entered service in 1981, and is planned to be in service into the 2030s. It is one of the largest military helicopters in service, and is operated from U.S. Navy ships or from land.

The Navy also operates the MH-53E Sea Dragon which fills the United States Navy&#x27;s need for long-range minesweeping or airborne mine countermeasures missions, and performs heavy-lift duties for the Navy. The Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion, which has new engines, new composite rotor blades, and a wider aircraft cabin, is set to replace the CH-53E and enter service in the 2020s. Most of the Super Stallions in service are configured as MH-53E Sea Dragons.

==Development==

===Background===
The CH-53 was the product of the U.S. Marines&#x27; &quot;Heavy Helicopter Experimental&quot; (HH(X)) competition begun in 1962. Sikorsky&#x27;s S-65 was selected over Boeing Vertol&#x27;s modified CH-47 Chinook version. The prototype YCH-53A first flew on 14 October 1964. The helicopter was designated &quot;CH-53A Sea Stallion&quot; and delivery of production helicopters began in 1966. The first CH-53As were powered by two General Electric T64-GE-6 turboshaft engines with 2,850 shp (2,125 kW) and had a maximum gross weight of 46,000 lb (20,865 kg), including 20,000 lb (9,072 kg) in the payload.

Variants of the original CH-53A Sea Stallion include the RH-53A/D, HH-53B/C, CH-53D, CH-53G, and MH-53H/J/M. The RH-53A and RH-53D were used by the US Navy for minesweeping. The CH-53D included a more powerful version of the General Electric T64 engine, used in all H-53 variants, and external fuel tanks. The CH-53G was a version of the CH-53D produced in West Germany for the German Army.

The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s HH-53B/C &quot;Super Jolly Green Giant&quot; was for special operations and combat rescue, and was first deployed during the Vietnam War. The Air Force&#x27;s MH-53H/J/M Pave Low helicopters were the last of the twin-engined H-53s and were equipped with extensive avionics upgrades for all-weather operation.

===H-53E===
In October 1967, the US Marine Corps issued a requirement for a helicopter with a lifting capacity 1.8 times that of the CH-53D that would fit on amphibious warfare ships. The US Navy and US Army were also seeking similar helicopters at the time. Before the issue of the requirement, Sikorsky had been working on an enhancement to the CH-53D, under the company designation &quot;S-80&quot;, featuring a third turboshaft engine and a more powerful rotor system. Sikorsky proposed the S-80 design to the Marines in 1968. The Marines liked the idea, since it promised to deliver a good solution quickly, and funded the development of a testbed helicopter for evaluation.
In 1970, against pressure by the US Defense Secretary to take the Boeing Vertol XCH-62 being developed for the Army, the Navy and Marines were able to show the Army&#x27;s helicopter was too large to operate on landing ships and were allowed to pursue their helicopter. Prototype testing investigated the addition of a third engine and a larger rotor system with a seventh blade in the early 1970s. In 1974, the initial YCH-53E first flew.

Changes on the CH-53E also include a stronger transmission and a fuselage stretched . The main rotor blades were changed to a titanium-fiberglass composite. The tail configuration was also changed. The low-mounted, symmetrical, horizontal tail was replaced by a larger, vertical tail, and the tail rotor tilted from the vertical to provide some lift in hover while counteracting the main rotor torque. Also added was a new automatic flight control system. The digital flight control system prevented the pilot from overstressing the aircraft.

YCH-53E testing showed that it could lift (to a wheel height), and without an external load, could reach at a gross weight. This led to two preproduction aircraft and a static test article being ordered. At this time, the tail was redesigned to include a high-mounted, horizontal surface opposite the rotor with an inboard section perpendicular to the tail rotor then at the strut connection cants 20° to horizontal. This helps with a tilt at high speed.

The initial production contract was awarded in 1978, and service introduction followed in February 1981. The first production CH-53E flew in December 1980. The US Navy acquired the CH-53E in small numbers for shipboard resupply. The Marines and Navy acquired a total of 177.

The base-model CH-53E serves both the US Navy and Marines in the heavy-lift transport role. It is capable of lifting heavy equipment, including the eight-wheeled LAV-25 light armored vehicle and the M198 155 mm Howitzer with ammunition and crew. The Super Stallion can recover aircraft up to its size, which includes all Marine Corps aircraft except for the KC-130.

By 2017, the CH-53E reportedly required 40 maintenance hours per flight hour due to aging parts, lack of available new replacement parts, and the extension of the overall airframe lifetime.

===MH-53E===

The Navy requested a version of the CH-53E for the airborne mine countermeasures role, designated &quot;MH-53E Sea Dragon&quot;. It has enlarged sponsons to provide substantially greater fuel storage and endurance. It also retained the in-flight refueling probe and could be fitted with up to seven 300-US-gallon (1136-liter) ferry tanks internally. The MH-53E digital flight-control system includes features specifically designed to help tow minesweeping gear. The prototype MH-53E made its first flight on 23 December 1981. MH-53E was used by the Navy beginning in 1986. The MH-53E is capable of in-flight refueling and can be refueled at hover. The MH-53E Sea Dragon is also used for heavy vertical delivery. The Helicopters are still in service as of the 2020s.

Additionally, a number of MH-53E helicopters were exported to Japan as the S-80-M-1 for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

The MH-53E is tasked with mine hunting, sweeping, clearing, and can use specialized equipment such as towed rigs. With the helicopter&#x27;s heavy lift abilities, it can also be used for ship-to-shore transport and vertical on-board delivery (VOD).

===CH-53K===

The US Marine Corps had been planning to upgrade most of their CH-53Es to keep them in service, but this plan stalled. Sikorsky then proposed a new version, originally the &quot;CH-53X&quot;, and in April 2006, the USMC signed a contract for 156 aircraft as the &quot;CH-53K&quot;. The Marines planned to start retiring CH-53Es in 2009 and needed new helicopters quickly. In August 2007, the USMC increased its CH-53K order to 227 helicopters. Their first flight was planned for November 2011. On 4 December 2012, Sikorsky delivered the first CH-53K, a Ground Test Vehicle (GTV) airframe.

The United States Marine Corps plans to receive 200 helicopters at a total cost of $25 billion. Ground Test Vehicle (GTV) testing started in April 2014; flight testing began with the maiden flight on 27 October 2015. In May 2018, the first CH-53K was delivered to the Marine Corps.

The U.S. Marine Corps received its first CH-53K simulator at Marine Corps Air Station New River in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on 1 May 2020. It is a Containerized Flight Training Device (CFTD) built by Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky&#x27;s parent company.

On 22 April 2022, Lt. General Mark R. Wise, Deputy Commandant for Aviation, declared initial operational capability for the CH-53K. By February 2023, nearly 20 CH-53K King Stallions have been produced.

==Design==


Although dimensionally similar, the three-engined CH-53E Super Stallion is a much more powerful aircraft than the original Sikorsky S-65 twin-engined CH-53A Sea Stallion. The CH-53E also added a larger main rotor system with a seventh blade.

The CH-53E was designed for transporting up to 55 troops with the installation of seats along the cabin center line or of cargo, and can carry externally slung loads up to . The CH-53E has incorporated the same crash-attenuating seats as the MV-22B to increase the survivability of passengers, but reduced its troop transport capacity to 30. The Super Stallion has a cruise speed of 173 mph (278 km/h) and a range of 621 miles (1,000 km). The helicopter is fitted with a forward-extendable in-flight refueling probe. It can carry three machine guns, one at the starboard side crew door; one at the port window, just behind the copilot; and a firing position on the tail ramp. The CH-53E also has chaff-flare dispensers.

The MH-53E features enlarged side-mounted fuel sponsons, and is rigged for towing various minesweeping and hunting gear from above the dangerous naval mines. The Sea Dragon can be equipped for minesweeping and cargo and passenger transportation. Its digital flight-control system includes features specifically designed to help towing minesweeping gear.

In addition, the CH-53E has been upgraded to include the helicopter night vision system, improved .50 BMG (12.7 mm) GAU-21/A and M3P machine guns, and AAQ-29A forward-looking infrared imager.

The CH-53E and the MH-53E were the largest helicopters in the Western world, until the CH-53K. They are fourth in the world to the Russian Mil Mi-26 &quot;Halo&quot; single-rotor helicopter and the enormous, twin transverse-rotored Mil V-12 &quot;Homer&quot; prototype, which could lift more than 22 tons (20 tonnes) and 44 tons (40 tonnes), respectively and the Mi-26&#x27;s single-rotor predecessor Mil Mi-6, which has less payload (12 tonnes), but is bigger and has a higher MTOW of 42 tonnes. Another heavy lift helicopter family is the CH-47 Chinook, which has a twin-tandem rotor configuration, with two engines. However, it is smaller than the Super Stallion.

In comparison of the largest lifting helicopters include the Mil Mi-26 has a maximum takeoff weight of 56,000 kg (123,000 lb) and can lift up to 20,000 kg (44,000 lb) externally, the King Stallion which has a MTOW of 38,600 kg (85,000 lb) and can lift up to 16,329 kg (36,000 lb) externally, the Mil-10, with and MTOW of 28,200 kg (62,170 lb) and can lift up to 12,000 kg (26,460 lb), the Chinook, at 22,680 kg (50,000 lb) and can lift up to 9,000 kg (20,000 lb) externally, and Mi-6, at 42,000 kg (92,594 lb) and can lift up to 12,000 kg (26,460 lb), the Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma can lift 9,800 kg (21,605 lb) and can lift up to 4,800 kg (10,582 lb) externally.
==Operational history==

The CH-53E Super Stallion first flew in 1974, a further development of the already developed CH-53 Sea Stallion, it would enter service 1981 with United States military. The helicopter was also used by the JASDF for many years.
===1980s===
The CH-53E Super Stallion entered service in 1981 with the United States Marine Corps.

The Super Stallion variant first entered service with the creation of Heavy Marine Helicopter Squadron 464 at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina. Two more squadrons were created at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin, California, over the next several years, HMH-465 and HMH-466. In addition, one West Coast training squadron, HMT-301, was given Super Stallions as was one more East Coast squadron, HMH-772, out of a reserve base at NASJRB Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Since then, other Marine heavy-lift squadrons have retired their CH-53As and Ds, replacing them with Es.

The Marine Corps CH-53E had its first shipboard deployment in 1983 when four CH-53E helicopters from HMH-464 deployed aboard USS &quot;Iwo Jima&quot; as part of the 24th Marine Amphibious Unit (24th MAU). During this deployment, Marines were sent ashore in Beirut, Lebanon, as peacekeepers, and established perimeters at and near the Beirut International Airport. On 23 October 1983, a truck bomb detonated by terrorists destroyed the Marine barracks in Beirut, killing nearly 240 service members as they slept. CH-53E helicopters from the 24th MAU provided critical combat support during this operation.

===1990s===

In 1991, two CH-53Es, along with several CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters, were sent to evacuate U.S. and foreign nationals from the U.S. embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia—Operation Eastern Exit—as violence enveloped the city during the Somalian Civil War.

During Operation Desert Storm, MH-53E shipboard-based Sea Dragons were used for mine-clearing operations in the Persian Gulf off Kuwait.

On 8 June 1995, Captain Scott O&#x27;Grady, an F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot shot down over Bosnia, was rescued by two CH-53Es.

In March 1997, CH-53E Super Stallions participated in the evacuation of nearly 900 American citizens and other civilians in Tirana, Albania as part of a non-combatant evacuation Operation Silver Wake.

===2000s===

On 26 October 2001, three CH-53Es aboard and three CH-53Es aboard flew to secure the first land base in Afghanistan, Camp Rhino, with 1100 troops at its peak. This amphibious raid is the longest amphibious raid in history. The long-range capability of the CH-53Es enabled Marines to establish a southern base in Afghanistan, putting the war on the ground.

Super Stallions again played a major role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. They were critical to moving supplies and ammunition to the most forward Marine units and also assisted in moving casualties back to the rear for follow-on care. Marine CH-53Es and CH-46Es carried US Army Rangers and Special Operations troops on a mission to rescue captured Army Private Jessica Lynch on 1 April 2003.

, about 150 CH-53E helicopters were in service with the Marines and another 28 MH-53Es were in service with the U.S Navy. The CH-53 requires 44 maintenance hours per flight hour. A flight hour costs about $20,000.

In 2019, the CH-53E fleet of the USMC achieved one million flight hours since 1981.

As of the 2020s, the MH-53 Sea Dragons are still in service as are CH-53 Super Stallions, and during a recent grounding the V-22 Osprey, Sea Stallions saw increased use.

Ongoing maintenance programs have helped extend the service life of the Super Stallion fleet, which is intended to be in service at least until the 2030s.

==Accidents==
=== Summary ===
Between 1969 and 1990, more than 200 servicemen were killed in accidents involving the CH-53A, CH-53D, and CH-53E.

The MH-53E Sea Dragon is the U.S. Navy&#x27;s helicopter with the highest accident rate, with 27 deaths from 1984 to 2008. During that time, its rate of class A mishaps, meaning serious damage or loss of life, was 5.96 per 100,000 flight hours, more than twice the Navy helicopter average of 2.26. An independent investigation reported that between 1984 and 2019, 132 people died in accidents on the Navy and Marine versions of this helicopter. A 2005 lawsuit alleged that since 1993, at least 16 in-flight fires or thermal incidents involved the number-two engine on Super Stallion helicopters. The suit claimed that proper changes were not made, nor were crews instructed on emergency techniques.

=== Major accidents ===
* On 1 June 1984, a CH-53E based at Tustin was lifting a truck from the deck of a ship during an exercise when a sling attached to the truck broke. This sent a shock wave into the aircraft and caused major damage. Four crew members died in the accident.
* On 19 November 1984, a CH-53E on a routine training mission at Camp Lejeune, NC, was lifting a seven-ton howitzer before it crashed. Six people were killed, and 11 injured. It experienced a loss of tail-rotor function, lost control, and hit the ground. The cabin area was quickly consumed by the ensuing fire.
* On 25 August 1985, a CH-53E from New River, North Carolina, was flying a routine supply and passenger run from Tustin to Twentynine Palms during a training operation when it caught fire and crashed in Laguna Hills. One of the three crew members was killed and the aircraft was a total loss.
* On 9 May 1986, a CH-53E crashed during training exercises near Twentynine Palms, killing four marines and injuring another.
* On 8 January 1987, a USMC CH-53E crashed while practicing night landings for troop deployment at the Salton Sea Test Range. All five crew members were killed.
* On 18 July 1988, a Navy MH-53E from HM-15 crashed at sea about 10 miles off the San Francisco coast killing the eight man crew. It was reported to have caught fire and exploded while towing a mine-countermeasures sled. This was the first MH-53E to crash.
* On 9 May 1996, a CH-53E crashed at Sikorsky&#x27;s Stratford plant, killing four employees on board. This led to the Navy grounding all CH-53Es and MH-53Es.
* On 10 August 2000, a MH-53E Sea Dragon crashed in the Gulf of Mexico near Corpus Christi and resulted in the deaths of four of the six crew members. The helicopters were later returned to service with improved swash-plate duplex bearings and new warning systems for the bearings.
* On 20 January 2002, a CH-53E crash in Afghanistan killed two crew members and injured five others. Defense Department officials said the early-morning crash was the result of mechanical problems with the helicopter.
* On 2 April 2002, a Navy MH-53E (BuNo 163051) of HM-14 crashed on the runway at Bahrain International Airport. All 18 people on board survived with only a few cases of minor injuries.
* On 27 June 2002, a Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon of Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 4 (HC-4) &quot;Black Stallions&quot; crashed in a hard landing at NAS Sigonella, Sicily. No one was injured, but the aircraft was written off.
* On 16 July 2003, a Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon of HC-4 &quot;Black Stallions&quot; crashed near the town of Palagonia, about 10 miles west-southwest of Naval Air Station Sigonella, killing the four member crew. The flight was on a routine training mission.
* On 26 January 2005, a CH-53E carrying 30 marines and one navy corpsman crashed in Al-Anbar province near Rutbah, Iraq, killing all 31 on board. A sandstorm was determined as the cause of the accident. The crash was part of the deadliest day of the Iraq War in terms of US fatalities.
* On 16 February 2005, an MH-53E from HC-4, based at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, crashed on the base, injuring the four crew members.
* On 17 February 2006, two CH-53Es carrying a combined U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force crew collided during a training mission over the Gulf of Aden, resulting in 10 deaths and two injuries.
* On 16 January 2008, a Navy MH-53E on a routine training mission crashed about 4 miles south of Corpus Christi, Texas. Three crew members died in the crash, and one crew member was treated at a local hospital.
* On 29 June 2012, a Navy MH-53E from HM-14 made an emergency landing 5 miles northeast of Pohang, South Korea, due to an in-flight fire. Though the pilots and aircrew were uninjured, the aircraft was heavily damaged by the fire.
* On 19 July 2012 a Navy MH-53E crashed 58 miles south of Muscat, Oman, during a heavy-lift operation, resulting in two deaths.
* On 8 January 2014, a US Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon crashed in the Atlantic 18 nautical miles east of Cape Henry, Virginia, with five crew members on board. Three crew members perished in the mishap.
* On 1 September 2014, a USMC CH-53E of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit crashed in the Gulf of Aden while attempting to land on the USS &quot;Mesa Verde&quot; following training operations in Djibouti. All 17 marines and 8 sailors on board were rescued.
* On 14 January 2016, two USMC CH-53Es on a night training exercise off the coast of Hawaii collided with each other, resulting in the loss of both aircraft and death of their 12 crew members; each CH-53E was carrying a crew of six.
* On 11 October 2017, a USMC CH-53E based at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma crash-landed in the Takae district of Higashi village in Okinawa. An engine fire forced a crash-landing 300 m from homes. While nobody was injured, the fire destroyed the helicopter. The US military grounded all CH-53Es in Japan, with the Japanese government calling for an indefinite grounding. The resumption of flights angered some local people and the Japanese government expressed displeasure.
* On 3 April 2018, a USMC CH-53E of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing crashed near Plaster City, California, killing four marines.
* On 7 February 2024, five U.S. marines were killed after a CH-53E crashed in San Diego County, California, U.S.

<text>The Symphony No. 6 in B minor, Op. 74, also known as the Pathétique Symphony, is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s final completed symphony, written between February and the end of August 1893. The composer entitled the work &quot;The Passionate Symphony&quot;, employing a Russian word, Патетическая (&quot;Pateticheskaya&quot;), meaning &quot;passionate&quot; or &quot;emotional&quot;, which was then translated into French as &quot;pathétique&quot;, meaning &quot;solemn&quot; or &quot;emotive&quot;.

The composer led the first performance in Saint Petersburg on of that year, nine days before his death. The second performance, conducted by Eduard Nápravník, took place 21 days later, at a memorial concert on . It included some minor corrections that Tchaikovsky had made after the premiere, and was thus the first performance of the work in the exact form in which it is known today. The first performance in Moscow was on , conducted by Vasily Safonov. It was the last of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s compositions premiered in his lifetime; his very last composition, the single-movement 3rd Piano Concerto, Op. 75, which was completed a short time before his death in October 1893, received a posthumous premiere.

== Title ==
The Russian title of the symphony, Патетическая (&quot;Pateticheskaya&quot;), means &quot;passionate&quot; or &quot;emotional&quot;, not &quot;arousing pity,&quot; but it is a word reflective of a touch of concurrent suffering. Tchaikovsky considered calling it Программная (&quot;Programmnaya&quot; or &quot;Programme Symphony&quot;) but realized that would encourage curiosity about the programme, which he did not want to reveal.

His brother Modest claims to have suggested the Патетическая title, which was used in early editions of the symphony; there are conflicting accounts about whether Tchaikovsky liked the title, but in any event his publisher chose to keep it and the title remained. Its French translation &quot;Pathétique&quot; is generally used in French, Spanish, English, German and other languages, Many English-speaking classical musicians had, by the early 20th century, adopted an English spelling and pronunciation for Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphony, dubbing it &quot;The Pathetic&quot;, as shorthand to differentiate it from a popular 1798 Beethoven piano sonata also known as &quot;The Pathétique&quot;. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphony was first published in piano reduction by Jurgenson of Moscow in 1893, and by Robert Forberg of Leipzig in 1894.

== Background ==
After completing his 5th Symphony in 1888, Tchaikovsky did not start thinking about his next symphony until April 1891, on his way to the United States. The first drafts of a new symphony were started in the spring of 1891. However, some or all of the symphony was not pleasing to Tchaikovsky, who tore up the manuscript &quot;in one of his frequent moods of depression and doubt over his alleged inability to create&quot;. In 1892, Tchaikovsky wrote the following to his nephew Vladimir &quot;Bob&quot; Davydov:

The symphony is only a work written by dint of sheer will on the part of the composer; it contains nothing that is interesting or sympathetic. It should be cast aside and forgotten. This determination on my part is admirable and irrevocable.

This work was the Symphony in E, the first movement of which Tchaikovsky later converted into the one-movement 3rd Piano Concerto (his final composition), and the latter two movements of which Sergei Taneyev reworked after Tchaikovsky&#x27;s death as the &quot;Andante and Finale&quot;.

In February 1893, Tchaikovsky mentions an entirely new symphonic work in a letter to his nephew &quot;Bob&quot; Davydov:

Now, on my journey, the idea of a new symphony came to me, this time one with a programme, but a programme that will be a riddle to everyone. Let them try and solve it ... The programme of this symphony is completely saturated with myself and quite often during my journey I cried profusely. Having returned, I have settled down to write the sketches and the work is going so intesely, so fast, that the first movement was ready in less than four days, and the others have taken shape in my head. Half of the third movement is also done. There will still be much that is new in the form of this work and the finale is not to be a loud &quot;allegro&quot; but the slowest &quot;adagio&quot;.

And to his brother:

I am now wholly occupied with the new work ... and it is hard for me to tear myself away from it. I believe it comes into being as the best of my works. I must finish it as soon as possible, for I have to wind up a lot of affairs and I must soon go to London. I told you that I had completed a Symphony which suddenly displeased me, and I tore it up. Now I have composed a new symphony &quot;which I certainly shall not tear up.&quot;

The symphony was written in a small house in Klin and completed by August 1893. Tchaikovsky left Klin on 19 October for the first performance in Saint Petersburg, arriving &quot;in excellent spirits&quot;. However, the composer began to feel apprehension over his symphony, when, at rehearsals, the orchestra players did not exhibit any great admiration for the new work. Nevertheless, the premiere was met with great appreciation. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s brother Modest wrote, &quot;There was applause and the composer was recalled, but with more enthusiasm than on previous occasions. There was not the mighty, overpowering impression made by the work when it was conducted by Eduard Nápravník, on November 18, 1893, and later, wherever it was played.&quot;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for an orchestra with the following instruments:
;Woodwinds
:3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo)
:2 oboes
:2 clarinets (in A)
:2 bassoons
;Brass
:4 horns
:2 trumpets
:3 trombones
:1 tuba
;Percussion
:timpani
:bass drum
:cymbals
:tam-tam (&quot;ad libitum&quot;)
;Strings
:violins I, II
:violas
:cellos
:double basses
Although not called for in the score, a bass clarinet is commonly employed to replace the solo bassoon for the four notes immediately preceding the &quot;Allegro vivo&quot; section of the first movement, which originates from Austro-Hungarian conductor Hans Richter. This substitution is because it is nearly impossible in practice for a bassoonist to execute the passage at the indicated dynamic of .

==Music==

The symphony is in four movements:

=== I. Adagio – Allegro non troppo ===

&lt;/score&gt;

The first movement, in sonata form, frequently alternates speeds, moods, and keys, with the main key being B minor. The introduction is formed from repeated modules of its initial theme, presented by the bassoon, whose purpose seems to be to open a dominant chord, failing to do so. Violas appear with the first theme of the Allegro in B minor, a faster variant of the slow opening melody. This section introduces the motif of the full, octave-long downward scale, which recurs throughout the symphony; it eventually leads to a long medial caesura that gives way to the secondary theme in D major.

&lt;/score&gt;

The energetic development section begins abruptly with an outburst from the full orchestra, with half-diminished harmony that leads uneasily to D minor. It runs seamlessly into the fortissimo recapitulation, a great contrast in atmosphere from its hesitant equivalent at the beginning of the Allegro. Tchaikovsky soon goes into something more nightmarish, which culminates in an explosion of despair and misery in B minor, accompanied by a strong and repetitive four-note figure in the brass, which recalls the motif from the introduction. This explosion concludes in a powerful note in the trombones marked quadruple forte, a rare, extreme dynamic marking. This section ends with diminishing strains on the basses and brass, letting through the pathos and upcoming despair of the symphony. The movement concludes shortly after the recapitulation of the second subject shown above, this time in the tonic major (B major) with a coda which is also in B major, finally ending very quietly.

The terms &quot;development&quot; and &quot;recapitulation&quot; are used loosely when describing the form of this movement. The structure of the first movement is a Type 2 sonata, which involves a typical expositional rotation, and a second rotation which includes a developmental section and a tonal closure. In the case of this movement, the essential closure is an imperfect authentic cadence (IAC), making it an example of sonata failure.

=== II. Allegro con grazia ===
The second movement, a D major dance in ternary form, is in time; it has been described as a &quot;limping&quot; waltz. The opening whirling, first presented as a cello section solo, contrasts with a darker B section in B minor, the tonic minor of the symphony. There is an upward momentum to the major sections, a suggestion of reconciliatory inversion of the downward scale motif. A fragmented coda crosses the scales and becomes more wistful before leading to a calm, rippling close.

=== III. Allegro molto vivace ===
The third movement starts with a scherzo, a playful, march-like weaving of and in a sonatina form. The strings establish a fast, light compound meter which later lies underneath more brusque wind fanfares in . This leads to the jubilant E major secondary theme in full, first given quietly by unison clarinets with a continued string accompaniment. Between the exposition and the recapitulation, there is no development section – only 2 bars of fragmentary retransition. The opening theme reappears emboldened, and after flourishes of scales traded between the strings and woodwind, the secondary theme returns triumphantly in G major; this is the only appearance of the bass drum and cymbals. The movement ends with a deceptive finale, once again featuring downward scales. It is probably no coincidence that the movement, with its stormy character through restless strings, wind-like whistling woodwinds and thundering brass instruments, is reminiscent of the finale from Joachim Raff&#x27;s Symphony No. 3 &quot;In the forest&quot;: the symphony was one of the most played of its time, and Tchaikovsky had already been inspired by Raff in his 5th Symphony with his famous horn solo.

=== IV. Adagio lamentoso ===
Back in B minor, although opened with striking half-diminished harmony, the fourth movement takes a slow six-part sonata rondo form (A-B-A-C-A-B). The opening A theme in the first and second violins appears frequently through the movement, varying in intensity. The theme is a &quot;composite melody&quot;: at first, neither the first nor second violins play in full the upper line that is heard.

A calmer B theme in D major builds up to a full orchestral palette, with driving brass and descending scales pushing to a Neapolitan C major caesura. The B theme is transformed in a dramatic return to B minor before the A theme returns. Similarly to the first movement, there is a turbulent climax with prominent trombones in the development section (the C theme). This is followed by the most agitated restatement of the A theme (the start of the recapitulation), on an F bass pedal. The music fades into a single, unique strike of a tam-tam; this quietly introduces a funereal chorale in the low brass which rounds off the dominant harmony. The return of the B section, originally a break in the clouds, is richly mournful, coinciding with the final resolution to B minor. The waves of descending muted string motifs carry on down into the lower strings and bassoons, finally dying away in total tragedy.

Among Tchaikovsky&#x27;s symphonies, this is the only one to end in a minor key. His first, second, fourth and fifth symphonies, plus the Manfred Symphony, are all minor-key symphonies that end in the tonic major, while the home key of his third symphony is D major (even though it begins in D minor) and that of his unfinished Symphony in E (unofficially &quot;No. 7&quot;) is E major.

It is also unusual for a slow movement to come at the end of a symphony. The despondent effect of the structural upheaval here has been the subject of much critical analysis. Had Tchaikovsky followed the standard four-movement structure, the movements would have been ordered like this:

==Interpretation==

Tchaikovsky critic Richard Taruskin writes:
Suicide theories were much stimulated by the Sixth Symphony, which was first performed under the composer&#x27;s baton only nine days before his demise, with its lugubrious finale (ending morendo, &#x27;dying away&#x27;), its brief but conspicuous allusion to the Orthodox requiem liturgy in the first movement and above all its easily misread subtitle. ... When the symphony was done again a couple of weeks later, in memoriam and with subtitle in place, everyone listened hard for portents, and that is how the symphony became a transparent suicide note. Depression was the first diagnosis. &#x27;Homosexual tragedy&#x27; came later.

In the words of the critic Alexander Poznansky, &quot;Since the arrival of the &#x27;court of honour&#x27; theory in the West, performances of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s last symphony are almost invariably accompanied by annotations treating it as a testimony of homosexual martyrdom.&quot; Yet critic David Brown describes the idea of the Sixth Symphony as some sort of suicide note as &quot;patent nonsense&quot;. Other scholars, including Michael Paul Smith, believe that with or without the supposed &#x27;court of honour&#x27; sentence, there is no way that Tchaikovsky could have known the time of his own death while composing his last masterpiece. There is also evidence that Tchaikovsky was unlikely to have been depressed while composing the symphony, with his brother noting of him after he had sent the manuscript for publishing, &quot;I had not seen him so bright for a long time past.&quot;

===Dedication and suggested programmes===
Tchaikovsky dedicated the &quot;Pathétique&quot; to his nephew, Vladimir &quot;Bob&quot; Davydov, whom he greatly admired.

The &quot;Pathétique&quot; has been the subject of a number of theories as to a hidden programme. This goes back to the first performance of the work, when fellow composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky whether there was a programme to the new symphony, and Tchaikovsky asserted that there was, but would not divulge it.

A suggested programme has been what Taruskin disparagingly termed &quot;symphony as suicide note&quot;. This idea began to assert itself as early as the second performance of the symphony in St Petersburg, not long after the composer had died. People at that performance &quot;listened hard for portents. As always, they found what they were looking for: a brief but conspicuous quotation from the Russian Orthodox requiem at the stormy climax of the first movement, and of course the unconventional Adagio finale with its tense harmonies at the onset and its touching depiction of the dying of the light in conclusion&quot;. Countering this is Tchaikovsky&#x27;s statement on 26 September/8 October 1893 that he was in no mood to write any sort of requiem. This was in reply to a suggestion from his close friend Grand Duke Konstantin that he write a requiem for their mutual friend the writer Aleksey Apukhtin, who had died in late August, just as Tchaikovsky was completing the &quot;Pathétique&quot;.

Tchaikovsky specialist David Brown suggests that the symphony deals with the power of Fate in life and death. This programme would not only be similar to those suggested for the Fourth and Fifth Symphonies, but also parallels a programme suggested by Tchaikovsky for his unfinished Symphony in E. That program reads, &quot;The ultimate essence ... of the symphony is Life. First part – all impulse, passion, confidence, thirst for activity. Must be short (the finale death – result of collapse). Second part love: third disappointments; fourth ends dying away (also short).&quot;

Simon Karlinsky, a composer and professor of Slavic languages and literature at UC Berkeley and &quot;an expert on homosexuality in pre-Soviet culture&quot;, wrote in the gay literary magazine &quot;Christopher Street&quot; in 1988 that in 1941 a musician friend of his youth called Alex, who had spent several months associating with the painter Pavel Tchelitchew, told him an oral tradition that Tchelitchew had heard from the composer&#x27;s brother Modest, told to him by Tchaikovsky himself. According to this, what Karlinsky himself calls &quot;poorly remembered hearsay&quot;, the secret programme of the symphony is about love between men: the search for it, from the beginning of the first movement; finding it, in the romantic &quot;andante&quot; theme (measure 89); and the attacks of a hostile world on it, in the agitated &quot;allegro vivo&quot; passage that follows (measure 161); and escape from that, in the return to the love theme (&quot;andante come prima&quot;, measure 305). The last movement, Karlinsky was told, is an elegy for a dead lover.

==In popular culture==

The second theme of the first movement formed the basis of a popular song in the 1940s, &quot;(This is) The Story of a Starry Night&quot; (by Mann Curtis, Al Hoffman and Jerry Livingston), which was popularized by Glenn Miller. That theme also served as the melody of &quot;Where&quot; by Tony Williams and The Platters (a 1959 hit for them), &quot;In Time&quot; by Steve Lawrence (1961) and &quot;John O&#x27;Dreams&quot; by Bill Caddick (1976); however, all four songs have different lyrics.

Excerpts from the symphony can be heard in a number of films, including Victor Young&#x27;s theme for Howard Hughes&#x27; 1943 American western &quot;The Outlaw&quot;, 1942&#x27;s &quot;Now, Voyager&quot;, the 1997 version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, as well as &quot;The Ruling Class&quot;, Minority Report, &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, &quot;Maurice&quot;, &quot;The Aviator&quot;, and &quot;The Death of Stalin&quot;. It has also been featured in &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; episode &quot;Son of Stimpy&quot; in a scene where the eponymous cat walks out into a blizzard.

The third movement was featured during the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony during the Sochi 2014 handover segment.

The symphony plays a major role in E. M. Forster&#x27;s novel &quot;Maurice&quot; (written in 1913 and later, but unpublished until 1971), where it serves as a veiled reference to homosexuality.

<text>GConf was a system used by the GNOME desktop environment for storing configuration settings for the desktop and applications. It is similar to the Windows Registry. 

It was deprecated as part of the GNOME 3 transition. Migration to its replacement, GSettings and dconf, is ongoing.

Changes to this system are controlled by GConfd, a daemon. GConfd watches out for changes to the database, and when they are changed, it applies the new settings to applications using it. This technology is known as &quot;auto-apply&quot;, compared to &quot;explicit-apply&quot;, which requires users to press an OK or Apply button to make changes come into effect. The term &quot;instant-apply&quot; is sometimes used, compared to plain &quot;apply&quot;.

The GConf database by default uses a system of directories and XML files, stored in a directory called codice_1. GConf can also use other backends, such as a database server, but XML file storage is the most common configuration.

The application gconf-editor is provided to allow users to change settings manually, but it is not normally used for end-user preferences.

==Architecture==
GConf is currently based on the C implementation of CORBA named ORBit. Its architecture consists of a session daemon that initializes various sources of configuration schemas on user login. Each source is based on a specific backend that translates the key and value pairs that compose the configuration database; the default backend is based on XML. At this time, this is the only working backend for GConf, although an LDAP backend existed in embryonic form. Each source can also be set to read-only, in order to create a default basic configuration, e.g. in a corporate network.

The values inside the GConf database are indexed using a path string in the form of codice_2.

The proper way to access the GConf database held by the GConf daemon is to use the GConfClient GObject-based class.

==Changes notification==
When writing an application that uses GConf, one should never directly poll the database. Instead, one should attach a callback to a given key, thus using a model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm. Each time an application changes the value bound to a specific key, the notification callbacks will be invoked.

==Schemas==
An application using GConf should provide a description for each key it creates inside the GConf database. This configuration meta-data is also stored inside the configuration database, and is called a &quot;schema&quot;; it could contain a (possibly localized) descriptive text, the valid type of the value bound to a key, and a default value.

==Bindings==
Like many libraries in the GNOME platform, GConf can be accessed using various programming languages, such as
C, C++, Perl, Java, C#, VB.NET and Python.

<doc id="574638" wikidata="Q1194904" url="?curid=574638" title="Sikorsky MH-53">
<text>The Sikorsky MH-53 Pave Low series is a retired long-range special operations and combat search and rescue (CSAR) helicopter for the United States Air Force. The series was upgraded from the HH-53B/C, variants of the Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. The HH-53 &quot;Super Jolly Green Giant&quot; was initially developed to replace the HH-3E &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot;. The U.S. Air Force&#x27;s MH-53J/M fleet was retired in September 2008.

==Design and development==
The US Air Force ordered 72 HH-53B and HH-53C variants for Search and Rescue units during the Vietnam War, and later developed the MH-53J Pave Low version for Special Operations missions.

The Pave Low&#x27;s mission was low-level, long-range, undetected penetration into denied areas, day or night, in adverse weather, for infiltration, exfiltration and resupply of special operations forces. Pave Lows often worked in conjunction with MC-130H Combat Talon for navigation, communications and combat support, and with MC-130P Combat Shadow for in-flight refueling.

The large green airframe of the HH-53B earned it the nickname &quot;Super Jolly Green Giant&quot;. This name is a reference to the smaller HH-3E &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot;, a stretched variant of the H-3 Sea King, used in the Vietnam War for combat search-and-rescue (CSAR) operations.

===HH-53B===
The US Air Force regarded their Sikorsky S-61R/HH-3E &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot; long-range CSAR helicopters favorably and was interested in the more capable S-65/CH-53A. In 1966, the USAF awarded a contract to Sikorsky for development of a CSAR variant of the CH-53A.
The HH-53B, as it was designated, featured:
* A retractable in-flight refueling probe on the right side of the nose
* Spindle-shaped jettisonable external tanks with a capacity of , fitted to the sponsons and braced by struts attached to the fuselage
* A rescue hoist above the right passenger door, capable of deploying a forest penetrator on of steel cable
* Armament of three pintle-mounted General Electric GAU-2/A 7.62 mm (.308 in) six-barreled Gatling-type machine guns, with one in a forward hatch on each side of the fuselage and one mounted on the tail ramp, with the gunner secured with a harness
* A total of of armor
* A Doppler navigation radar in the forward belly

Early HH-53Bs featured T64-GE-3 turboshafts with each, but these engines were later upgraded to T64-GE-7 turboshafts with . Five crew were standard, including a pilot, copilot, crew chief, and two pararescuemen.

===HH-53C===
The HH-53B was essentially an interim type, with production quickly moving on to the modestly improved Air Force HH-53C CSAR variant. The most visible difference between the HH-53B and HH-53C was that the HH-53C dispensed with the fuel-tank bracing struts. Experience with the HH-53B showed that the original tank was too big, adversely affecting performance when they were fully fueled, and so a smaller tank was adopted in its place. Other changes included more armor and a more comprehensive suite of radios to improve communications with C-130 tankers, attack aircraft supporting CSAR actions, and aircrews awaiting rescue on the ground. The HH-53C was otherwise much like the HH-53B, with the more powerful T64-GE-7 engines.
A total of 44 HH-53Cs were built, with introduction to service in August 1968. Late in the Vietnam War they were fitted with countermeasures pods to deal with heat-seeking missiles. As with the HH-53B, the HH-53C was also used for covert operations and snagging reentry capsules, as well as snagging reconnaissance drones. A few were assigned to support the Apollo space program, standing by to recover an Apollo capsule in case of a launchpad abort, though such an accident never happened.

In addition to the HH-53Cs, the Air Force obtained 20 CH-53C helicopters for more general transport work. The CH-53C was apparently very similar to the HH-53C, even retaining the rescue hoist, the most visible difference being that the CH-53C did not have an in-flight refueling probe. Since CH-53Cs were used for covert operations, they were armed and armored like HH-53Cs. A good number of Super Jollies were converted into &quot;Pave Low&quot; special-operations helicopters. PAVE or &quot;Pave&quot; is an Air Force code name for a number of weapons systems using advanced electronics.

===HH/MH-53H===
The USAF&#x27;s Super Jollies were essentially daylight / fair weather machines, and downed aircrew were often in trouble at night or in bad weather. A limited night / foul weather sensor system designated &quot;Pave Low I&quot; based on a low-light-level TV (LLLTV) imager was deployed to Southeast Asia in 1969 and combat-evaluated on a Super Jolly, but reliability was not adequate.

In 1975, an HH-53B was fitted with the much improved &quot;Pave Low II&quot; system and re-designated YHH-53H. This exercise proved much more satisfactory, and so eight HH-53Cs were given a further improved systems fit and redesignated &quot;HH-53H Pave Low III&quot;, with the YHH-53H also upgraded to this specification. All were delivered in 1979 and 1980.

The HH-53H retained the in-flight refueling probe, external fuel tanks, rescue hoist, and three-gun armament of the HH-53C; armament was typically a minigun on each side, and a Browning gun in the tail to provide more reach and a light anti-armor capability. The improvements featured by the HH-53H included:
* A Texas Instruments AN/AAQ-10 forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imager.
* A Texas Instruments AN/APQ-158 terrain-following radar (TFR), which was a digitized version of the radar used by the A-7. It was further modified to be able to give terrain avoidance and terrain following commands simultaneously (first aircraft capable of this unique feature).
* A Canadian Marconi Doppler-radar navigation system.
* A Litton or Honeywell inertial guidance system (INS).
* A computerized moving-map display.
* A radar-warning receiver (RWR) and chaff-flare dispensers.

The FLIR and TFR were mounted on a distinctive &quot;chin&quot; mount. The HH-53H could be fitted with 27 seats for troops or 14 litters. The upgrades were performed by the Navy in Pensacola, reflecting the fact that the Navy handled high-level maintenance on Air Force S-65s. In 1986, the surviving HH-53Hs were given an upgrade under the &quot;CONSTANT GREEN&quot; program, featuring incremental improvements such as a cockpit with blue-green lighting compatible with night vision goggles (NVGs). They were then reclassified as &quot;special operations&quot; machines and accordingly given a new designation of &quot;MH-53H&quot;.

The HH-53H proved itself and the Air Force decided to order more, coming up with an &quot;MH-53J Pave Low III Enhanced&quot; configuration. The general configuration of the MH-53J is similar to that of the HH-53J, the major change being fit of twin T64-GE-415 turboshafts with 4,380 shp (3,265 kW) each, as well as more armor, giving a total armor weight of 1,000 lb (450 kg). There were some avionics upgrades as well, including fit of a modern Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite navigation receiver. A total of 31 HH-53Bs, HH-53Cs, and CH-53Cs were upgraded to the MH-53J configuration from 1986 through 1990, with all MH-53Hs upgraded as well, providing a total of 41 MH-53Js.

===MH-53J/M===
The MH-53J Pave Low III helicopter was the largest, most powerful and technologically advanced transport helicopter in the US Air Force inventory. The terrain-following and terrain-avoidance radar, forward looking infrared sensor, inertial navigation system with Global Positioning System, along with a projected map display enable the crew to follow terrain contours and avoid obstacles, making low-level penetration possible.

Under the Pave Low III program, the Air Force modified nine MH-53Hs and 32 HH-53s for night and adverse weather operations. Modifications included AN/AAQ-18 forward-looking infrared, inertial navigation system, global positioning system, Doppler navigation systems, APQ-158 terrain-following and terrain-avoidance radar, an on-board mission computer, enhanced navigation system, and integrated avionics to enable precise navigation to and from target areas. The Air Force designated these modified versions as MH-53J.

The MH-53J&#x27;s main mission was to drop off, supply, and pick up special operations forces behind enemy lines. It also can engage in combat search and rescue missions. Low-level penetration was made possible by a state-of-the-art terrain following radar, as well as infrared sensors that allow the helicopter to operate in bad weather. It was equipped with armor plating. It could transport 38 troops at a time and sling up to 20,000 pounds (9,000 kg) of cargo with its external hook. It was capable of a top speed of 165 mph (266 km/h) and had a ceiling of 16,000 feet (4,900 m).

The MH-53M Pave Low IV was modified from the MH-53J configuration with the addition of Interactive Defensive Avionics System/Multi-Mission Advanced Tactical Terminal or IDAS/MATT. The system enhanced the defensive capabilities of the Pave Low. It provided instant access to the total battlefield situation, through near real-time Electronic Order of Battle updates. It also provided a new level of detection avoidance with near real-time threat broadcasts over-the-horizon, so crews can avoid and defeat threats, and replan en route if necessary.

==Operational history==

While waiting for delivery of the HH-53Bs, the Air Force obtained two Marine CH-53As for evaluation and training. The first of eight HH-53Bs performed its initial flight on 15 March 1967, and the type was performing CSAR missions with the USAF Aerospace Rescue &amp; Recovery Service in Southeast Asia by the end of the year. The Air Force called the HH-53B the &quot;Super Jolly&quot;. It was used for CSAR, covert combat operations, and &quot;snagging&quot; reentry capsules from photo-reconnaissance satellites.

The Air Force lost 17 Super Jollies during the Southeast Asia conflict, with 14 lost in combat – including one that was shot down by a North Vietnamese MiG-21 on 28 January 1970 while on a CSAR mission over Laos – and three lost in accidents. The Super Jollies made headlines in November 1970 in the unsuccessful raid into North Vietnam to rescue prisoners-of-war from the Son Tay prison camp, as well as in the operation to rescue the crew of the freighter SS &quot;Mayagüez&quot; from Cambodian Khmer Rouge fighters in May 1975. 

The HH-53B, HH-53C, and CH-53C remained in Air Force service into the late 1980s. Super Jollies operating in front-line service were painted in various camouflage color schemes, while those in stateside rescue service were painted in an overall gray scheme with a yellow tailband.

The first nine HH-53H Pave Lows became operational on 1 July 1980, and were transferred from the Military Airlift Command, where they were to have been CSAR assets, to the 1st Special Operations Wing in the aftermath of the &quot;Operation Eagle Claw&quot; disaster. Two of the HH-53Hs were lost in training accidents in 1984, and so two CH-53Cs were brought up to HH-53H standard as replacements.

Five MH-53Js of the 20th Special Operations Squadron deployed to Panama as part of Operation Just Cause in December 1989. During the operation, MH-53Js conducted missions including reconnaissance, small team insertion, medivac, logistics, and fire support. The MH-53&#x27;s terrain-following and terrain-avoidance radar, along with GPS, enabled the helicopters to reach objectives other helicopters could not; in one case, an MH-53 used its precision navigation capability to lead a SEAL team on MH-6 Little Bird helicopters to their remote objective. 20th SOS crews flew 193 sorties during the operation, totaling 406.1 hours of flying time.

The MH-53 Pave Low&#x27;s last mission was on 27 September 2008, when the remaining six helicopters flew in support of special operations forces in Southwest Asia. These MH-53Ms were retired shortly thereafter and replaced with the V-22 Osprey.

==Variants and modification/upgrade programs==

* TH-53A – training version used by US Air Force (USAF)
* HH-53B – CH-53A type for USAF search and rescue (SAR). All helicopters modified with an experimental Limited Night Recovery System (LNRS). Some modified to Pave Imp LNRS-standard. One HH-53B serial number 66-14433 converted to Pave Low I Test Bed at Edwards Air Force Base in 1972. HH-53B 66-14433 consequently became the YHH-53H Black Knight. 
* Pave Star - Program designed to address shortcomings of LNRS and deliver an improved night infiltration and rescue capability. Cancelled due to multiple technical issues and cost overruns
* Pave Imp - LNRS developed by USAF Air Force Systems Command. Replaced Pave Star. Some HH-53B and C&#x27;s converted. Used in action during the Vietnam War
* CH-53C – heavy-lift version for USAF, 22 built
* HH-53C – &quot;Super Jolly Green Giant&quot;, improved HH-53B for USAF. Some fitted with Pave Imp LNRS.
* Pave Low I - Program built on lessons learned from Pave Star, Pave Imp and LNRS. A proof-of-concept test program with the objective of developing a true night and all-weather capability for the HH-53. The main difference from earlier programs centred around the evaluation of a modified Norden AN/APQ-141 Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance radar along with associated instrumentation, and modifications to existing systems.
* Pave Low II - Program which aimed to address three distinct limitations identified in previous programs; the inability to avoid terrain and exposure to hostile radar/sensor-directed threats at low level; insufficient accuracy in the navigation system to reach the rescue area at low level; and inability to precisely locate the survivor(s) and hold a hover over his/her position.
* Pave Low III - Follow-on program to Pave Low II, but with the LNRS-vintage Low Level Light Television (LLLTV) system replaced with the more capable AN/AAQ-10 Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, along with the installation of the AN/APQ-158 Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance Radar and an Inertial Navigation System. Other equipment additions included a central avionics computer and a projected map display system

* YHH-53H Black Knight – HH-53B 66-14433 Test Bed for Pave Low II and Pave Low III systems. Became Pave Low III prototype. Later brought up to Pave Low III production standard.
* HH-53H – Production standard Pave Low III variant. Eight HH-53Cs, two CH-53Cs and the YHH-53H Black Knight were upgraded to this standard at the Naval Air Rework Facility in Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola, Florida.
* MH-53H – Re-designation of HH-53H to highlight the additional role of Special Operations in conjunction with its original SAR role.
* MH-53J – &quot;Pave Low IIIE (E for Enhanced)&quot; Upgraded MH-53H. Improved variant with integrated digital avionics, an upgraded transmission, more powerful engines, and various enhanced mission and defensive systems. Remaining HH-53B and C-variants converted to this standard.
* MH-53M – &quot;Pave Low IV&quot; upgraded MH-53Js

For other H-53 variants, see CH-53 Sea Stallion, CH-53E Super Stallion and CH-53K King Stallion.

<text>Gconf-editor is a discontinued utility for the GNOME desktop environment used to maintain the old and now discontinued GNOME registry gconf.

Gconf-editor gives users the ability to access settings stored in the XML-based GConf configuration database or registry. It is used primarily by developers to debug applications, or by power users to edit hidden and complex settings. It abstracts the values from the GConf database and presents them in an interface similar to Microsoft Windows&#x27; registry editor.

Other gconf tools have also appeared, such as Gconfpref by MandrakeSoft. There are also patches for popular applications, which add the ability to change the hidden options from within the application itself, avoiding the need for gconf-editor.

There is also the dconf-editor for the dconf; dconf has replaced Gconf.

<doc id="574655" wikidata="Q5531603" url="?curid=574655" title="Geneforge">
<text>Geneforge is a series of demoware role-playing video games by Jeff Vogel of Spiderweb Software released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS systems. There are five games in the series: &quot;Geneforge (video game)&quot;, &quot;Geneforge 2&quot;, &quot;Geneforge 3&quot;, &quot;Geneforge 4: Rebellion&quot;, and &quot;Geneforge 5: Overthrow&quot;. As with all Spiderweb Software titles, graphics and sound are limited because they are not the main focus of the game.

==Plot==
The &quot;Geneforge&quot; storylines takes place in an era resembling the medieval time period, but with the addition of some modern innovations, such as wiring, levers and buttons, alarms, glass, and other steampunk-esque tools. The games involve a group of mages called &quot;Shapers&quot;, who dominate the game world due to their ability to create life as they see fit. The player character is cast as an apprentice Shaper in the first three games, as a neophyte rebel in the fourth, and as an unaligned amnesiac in the fifth. Crises in the game result from the Shapers&#x27; mistreatment of their creations while trying to ensure that their art does not wreak havoc on the world, versus the freedom of intelligent creations at the cost of said havoc. The player is left to determine what is the right thing to do, such as using mysterious skill canisters which may breed arrogance in the user in return for increased power.

The games are highly non-linear, with multiple goals allowing the player to join any sect, and receive one of a number of different endings (the canonical ending for each game being revealed in the following one). There is a high degree of player influence on the game world, and the existence of multiple solutions to problems. For example, one sect may give you the quest to destroy an object, while an opposing sect will charge you with its protection.

===The Geneforge===
The Geneforge itself is the culmination of the game world&#x27;s technology, a means of genetic enhancement of living things that greatly increases their physical and magical abilities. All Geneforges thus far have taken the form of small colourful pools of semi-living chemicals, and are used through physical contact. Using the Geneforge is generally excruciating and requires protective equipment to prevent outright fatality. In the first, fourth and fifth games, the Geneforge is usable by humans (and in turn, the player), but in &quot;Geneforge 2&quot; and &quot;Geneforge 3&quot;, it could only be used by specific intelligent creations. The first three games each climax with the player&#x27;s decision to either destroy the Geneforge or to ensure its use; the Geneforge is encountered near the start of the fourth and fifth games.

==Gameplay==
The games are played in a 45° axonometric view. &quot;Real-time&quot; adventure mode switches to a turn-based combat, reminiscent of classic RPGs such as &quot;Ultima VI&quot;. The lands are split up into small areas, which can be traveled through using a world map. Once a certain objective has been completed in an area, it can be skipped through on the world map, allowing the player&#x27;s party to move very quickly throughout the land.

===Combat===
During combat mode, each character gets a certain number of action points, which are spent moving, attacking, casting spells, and using items. Unless enhanced or affected, the player and their allies in the Party Roster will start with 8 action points.

The characters may attack with melee weapons, such as fists and blades, ranged weapons, such as thorn batons, wands, javelins, crystals, or magic spells. The chance of hitting an enemy is influenced by the character&#x27;s attributes, such as strength, dexterity, or intelligence as well as the character&#x27;s relative weapon or magic skills.

Equipment plays a significant part in a character&#x27;s performance. The quality of equipment determines the damage dealt and received by the character. The player can use magically enhanced spores, pods, and rods to heal and strengthen themselves and their allies.

Creations, unable to equip or use items, are made before combat and can be used as powerful tools against the enemies. There are three main classes of creations - Magical, who specialize in magical projectiles; Battle, who specialize in close combat; and Fire, who use a mix of projectiles and melee.

===Character classes===
The &quot;Geneforge&quot; series is known for its versatile skill development, demanding many strategic decisions from the player. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses what class of Shaper to play. When the player gains a level, they gain several skill points, which can be spent on improving the character&#x27;s abilities. Depending on the strengths and weaknesses of each type of player (Shaper, Guardian, and Agent), the skills have varying costs. The class&#x27;s skills are generally exaggerated as the character levels up.

==Games==
===Geneforge===

&quot;Geneforge&quot; is the first game in the series. It was released for Macintosh on December 12, 2001, and for Windows on March 19, 2002. The game engages the player into the origins of the Shapers as well as an introduction to the series as to the &quot;Geneforge&quot; itself. The player assume the role of an apprentice Shaper who is cast away on an island abandoned, or &quot;barred&quot; as the plot calls it, by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers&#x27; creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding the sect. The player must escape the island, after dealing with the forces at work to steal the Shaper secrets that were abandoned on Sucia Isle long ago.

===Geneforge 2===

&quot;Geneforge 2&quot; engages on how the tumult of the Geneforge influenced the Shapers and their creations, and takes place in an isolated mountain valley (revealed to be located in southwestern Terrestia in the final game). The game engine remains essentially unchanged from the original &quot;Geneforge&quot;. &quot;Geneforge 2&quot; offers a number of changes and additions over its predecessor. Three new creations and several new spells are available. In addition, the player can persuade some NPCs and unaligned monsters to join their party.

===Geneforge 3===

&quot;Geneforge 3&quot; deals with the fallout of the previous games as the battle lines are drawn, and takes place among the Ashen Isles. The Geneforge game engine has been revamped in this sequel, debatably improving gameplay in some instances and making others more cumbersome to deal with. No new creations or spells are available, however a number of different features have been added, for instance, two NPCs (Alwan and Greta) who will join the player&#x27;s party and a new forging system, allowing the player to create powerful artifacts or enhance existing items.

===Geneforge 4: Rebellion===

&quot;Geneforge 4: Rebellion&quot; picks up eight years later at the height of the rebellion against the Shapers, and is set in the east of the continent of Terrestia. Unlike the previous three &quot;Geneforge&quot; games, the player is no longer a Shaper, and is not restricted to the original three classes. Both of the player&#x27;s companions from &quot;Geneforge 3&quot; (Alwan and Greta) have grown up and are now leaders of the two rival factions in the game (the Shapers and the Rebels, respectively). The player can choose from five separate rebel classes, including playing as a servile. The resolution in &quot;Geneforge 4&quot; is considerably larger, using a bigger map and smaller icons, increasing the player&#x27;s overview. The graphics are improved, with better animations and cut-scenes than the previous three games. The sounds and gameplay system of the game however, remain unchanged.

===Geneforge 5: Overthrow===

&quot;Geneforge 5: Overthrow&quot; is the final game in the &quot;Geneforge&quot; saga and takes place near the end of the war, about 4 years after the conclusion of &quot;Geneforge 4: Rebellion&quot;. Players may choose from between the three Shaper classes, as well as the six rebel classes. The graphics are improved in numerous aspects, with better animations and cut-scenes. The plot is more akin to that of &quot;Geneforge 2&quot; in that there are multiple factions that the player can join, whereas in the third and fourth games, there are only two major factions. The Player must choose between the five factions and decide for themselves how the saga will end.

<doc id="574660" wikidata="Q402060" url="?curid=574660" title="Ahmose, son of Ebana">
<text>Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian military under the pharaohs Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, and Thutmose I. His autobiography, which is inscribed on the wall of his tomb, and remains remarkably intact, is a valuable source of information on the late 17th Dynasty and the early 18th Dynasty of Egypt.

Ahmose was born in the city of Nekheb, the modern El Kab. During the war to expel the Hyksos from Egypt, in the reign of Seqenenre Tao, his father enlisted in the navy. After the deaths of Tao and his son Kamose, Ahmose began to serve as a soldier under Pharaoh Ahmose I. He participated in the battle of Avaris (the Hyksos capital in the Delta), where he killed two Hyksos and was awarded the &quot;gold of valor&quot; twice. Ahmose was awarded slaves and other spoils by the pharaoh after Avaris was sacked.
Ahmose also participated in the three-year siege of Sharuhen in southern Canaan for which he was rewarded. He followed his king to Nubia, where they put down three rebellions.

Under Amenhotep I, he fought against the Nubians and was given gold and slaves for his bravery. 

During the reign of Thutmose I, Ahmose participated in a naval campaign against Nubian tribes in the Nile valley and was appointed admiral. He also followed Thutmose on a campaign against Naharin all the way to the Euphrates River.

Ebana was the name of Ahmose&#x27;s mother, who was most likely a woman of importance on Egyptian society; his father&#x27;s name was Baba. Paheri, the grandson of Ahmose and a scribe and priest of the goddess Nekhbet and tutor to the prince Wadjmose, supervised the building of his grandfather&#x27;s tomb.

<text>Geneforge is the first video game in the &quot;Geneforge&quot; series of role-playing video games created by Spiderweb Software.

Players assume the role of an apprentice Shaper, a sect of mages who can create living creatures through force of will. The apprentice is cast away on Sucia, an island abandoned by the sect 200 years prior. The island contains groups of the Shapers&#x27; creations, who have formed their own ideologies regarding their creators in the intervening years. The primary motivation of the player is to escape the island and, in the process, deal with the forces working to steal the Shaper secrets abandoned on Sucia Isle.

The game&#x27;s setting stemmed from the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of &quot;Geneforge&quot; were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game&#x27;s setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had difficulties balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer&#x27;s expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb&#x27;s &quot;Avernum&quot; series would deter players. &quot;Geneforge&quot; received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.

==Gameplay==
Players create a character and travel around Sucia Island, a location Barred to the members of the player character&#x27;s sect. Whilst searching for a way off the island, the game&#x27;s ultimate goal, players can form alliances with the island&#x27;s inhabitants and complete quests through combat or other means. &quot;Geneforge&quot; is played in 45° axonometric perspective, movement through the game&#x27;s environs is real-time but switches to turn-based combat in the game&#x27;s playing field. The game world is divided up into 77 areas accessible through a world map. The first two areas serve as the game&#x27;s tutorial; introducing players to navigation, controls and shaping creations. Clearing areas by defeating guardians or successfully traversing the terrain allows players to bypass those areas via the world map, reducing travelling time. The game has an always-visible auto-map, which begins each area completely darkened, and is revealed as the player explores. As the player&#x27;s party performs tasks or defeats enemies they receive experience, leading to increased levels and additional skill points. The player character&#x27;s skill points can be used to increase their statistics or to improve their aptitude in one of the fifteen available skills. Canisters which increase skills or add new abilities are scattered throughout the game.

Before starting the game, players choose from three basic character classes, each of which has a particular playing style. Guardians are fighters who excel in standard combat skills, especially hand-to-hand fighting. They are capable of shaping creations, but have little affinity for magic. Agents excel in spell casting and are capable of hand-to-hand combat, but have poor shaping skills. The Shaper is a summoner, capable of creating living creatures by using their own life essence. Shapers rely on their creations for protection. Every character class is referred to as &quot;Shaper&quot; in-game. Most objectives in the game must be completed via combat or diplomacy, but players can also use subterfuge to pass obstacles. All three character classes can use different methods, depending on which skills they are adept in. Some areas are difficult to pass, and some tasks are difficult to complete, unless the player character is a certain class. Each character class has a different combat style, the combat skills they are associated with cost fewer skill points to increase.

Essence is used for both creating creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations is limited by the player&#x27;s essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature which costs 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player&#x27;s combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points in the same manner as the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations&#x27; statistics, but every statistic increase costs more essence and reduces the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.

Combat is turn-based, with each character in the player&#x27;s party receiving action points at the beginning of the player&#x27;s turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number of points, for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character&#x27;s turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out of points. Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation&#x27;s intelligence and control them manually.

&quot;Geneforge&quot;&#x27;s dialogue is delivered through on-screen text. Encounters with intelligent creations or humans result in the player being given a series of pre-determined questions or responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player&#x27;s previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player&#x27;s leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold at the start of the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.

==Plot==

The player begins as an initiate of a powerful sect of magicians, the Shapers. Members of the sect create living beings from the magical essence within themselves. Apprentices are sent to academies to learn the art of shaping and the player&#x27;s character has been accepted to do so. The player departs on a voyage to the academy aboard a specially modified Drayk, a dragon-like Shaper Creation. During the journey, the Shaper passes a group of islands, one of which is recognized as the Barred Sucia Island. Locations Barred by the Shapers are closed to both the sect and outsiders alike, meaning a catastrophe has occurred or something very valuable is located there. As the Shaper examines Sucia, lost in thought, the craft is attacked and mortally wounded by an unidentified sailing ship. After igniting the vessel&#x27;s sails with a fireball, the craft deposits the Shaper on an abandoned dockside before dying. The player is now stranded on Sucia Island and must find a way to leave.

Exploration of the docks reveals a strange canister filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper&#x27;s body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character&#x27;s skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user&#x27;s mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament.

Serviles remain on the island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe that they should be treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.

After encountering the three servile groups, the player begins to learn of a group of foreigners known as Sholai, explorers who have been shipwrecked on the island. It was the Sholai, led by a man named Trajkov, who attacked the player with their last remaining ship. Trajkov controls a device called the Geneforge, created by the Shapers, which can rewrite the user&#x27;s DNA and make them incredibly powerful. This is the cause of the island&#x27;s Barred status, the device was deemed too dangerous in the wrong hands. Trajkov and his followers have allied themselves with the Takers, absorbing the contents of canisters and trying to claim Shaper powers as their own. The group have been unable to activate the Geneforge itself due to a Shaper being needed to activate the device. A Shaper named Goettsch was kidnapped for this purpose, in the same manner as the player-character. Goettsch fled and stole the shaping gloves needed to safely use the Geneforge, causing Trajkov to attempt to kidnap the player as a replacement. During these events, some Sholai have escaped from their increasingly violent and unpredictable leader.

The player is free to join any one of the servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. &quot;Geneforge&quot; can be completed without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge&#x27;s energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock on the far side of the island. Finishing the game unlocks one of more than a dozen game endings, dependent on the player&#x27;s actions during the game.

==Development==
Work on &quot;Geneforge&quot; began during the development of &quot;Avernum 2&quot;, initially little information was revealed. In an interview published by &quot;RPGDot&quot; Vogel compared the game&#x27;s movement system to &quot;Fallout&quot; and revealed that a new game engine was being implemented. The project had initially been intended as pure science fiction but this was soon abandoned in favor of a mixed fantasy and science fiction setting. In an interview published on website &quot;RPG Codex&quot;, Vogel stated this was due difficulties maintaining game balance with futuristic weaponry which &quot;should be devastating&quot;. He added: &quot;I found it to be too difficult to model the weapons in a way that simultaneously felt sensible and maintained balance&quot;.

&quot;Geneforge&quot; stemmed from the idea of creating a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, &quot;Geneforge&quot; was designed so that it would be possible to complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Shadows of Amn&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Deus Ex&quot; and &quot;EverQuest&quot; as influences.

The game marked a departure from the &quot;Avernum&quot; series and its predecessor the &quot;Exile&quot; series, Vogel expressed a need to work on other projects: &quot;Every few years, I need to do something cool and weird. It keeps me interested&quot;. He also added that the differences in &quot;Geneforge&quot; meant the game might struggle to find an audience, but the sales exceeded his expectations.

==Reception==
&quot;Geneforge&quot; received positive reviews, the game&#x27;s story and lack of bugs received praise in particular. InsideMacGames&#x27; Christopher Morin suggested that players interested in a &quot;strong storyline and a unique take on magic&quot; would be impressed, but not those who sought high quality graphics and sound. The game&#x27;s setting has been described as unique and fresh, the level of detail in &quot;Geneforge&quot;&#x27;s fictional world was praised by reviewers. Jeff Green of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; praised the game for its &quot;story and gameplay&quot; as something that high-budget games often lack.

The quality of the game&#x27;s graphics was rated poorly by most reviewers, reviewers noted that the overall quality of the game made up for this deficiency. GameSpy&#x27;s Carla Harker described the graphics as &quot;...dated by about seven years&quot; and the game as a &quot;technological pariah&quot;, despite calling it one of the best role-playing games released in the past year. Green similarly described graphics as dated and something to put up with in favor of gameplay. Website Just RPG&#x27;s Eric Arevalo described them as simplistic but noted the game&#x27;s story and the ability to control &quot;fascinating mutant creatures&quot; made up for this. The Entertainment Depot&#x27;s Nick Stewart differed, praising the graphics as &quot;simplistic without being plain, lavish without being overdone&quot; as well as the fluidity of character animation and detail of character designs.

The almost total lack of music, except for the title screen theme song, and complete lack of voice acting was noted by reviewers. This highlighted the game&#x27;s sound effects and environmental sounds, such as weapons clashing and the background noise of towns. Nick Stewart found &quot;a fairly decent variety of effects and noises scattered throughout&quot;, that they &quot;added somewhat to the experience&quot;, but became irritated by the amount of hissing and popping in the environmental sounds after extended play. Carla Harker described the sound as &quot;almost non-existent&quot; and Eric Arevalo found that there weren&#x27;t enough sound effects. RPGDot&#x27;s Val Sucher noted that the music player Winamp could be played in the background, due to the game&#x27;s small memory requirements.

Presently, a remaster titled &quot;Geneforge 1- Mutagen&quot; is in the making after successful kickstarter backing. This remaster will run on newer computers, and include new content.

<doc id="574664" wikidata="Q1240511" url="?curid=574664" title="Donald Woods">
<text>Donald James Woods (15 December 1933 – 19 August 2001) was a South African journalist and anti-apartheid activist. As editor of the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot;, he was known for befriending fellow activist Steve Biko, who was killed by police after being detained by the South African government. Woods continued his campaign against apartheid in London, and in 1978 became the first private citizen to address the United Nations Security Council. Steve Biko and other like-minded students created SASO (South African Student Organization).. 

==Early life==

Woods was born at Hobeni, Cape Province, where his family had lived for five generations. His ancestors arrived in South Africa with the 1820 Settlers. Woods was born and raised in what has since become the Eastern Cape province, as were both of his parents, all four of his grandparents, all eight of his great grandparents and all sixteen of his great, great grandparents. All thirty-two of his great great great grandparents emigrated to the Cape Colony from England. His parents ran a trading post in Transkei, a tribal reserve, which the South African government would later designate a bantustan. As a boy Woods had extensive regular contact with the Xhosa people. He spoke fluent Xhosa and Afrikaans, as well as his mother tongue, English.

Woods and his brother, Harland, were sent to the Christian Brothers College in Kimberley in the predominantly Afrikaner Northern Cape for their secondary education. The school was academically rigorous, and the Irish Christian Brothers had a reputation for neutrality on questions of politics. While Woods was away at school, the National Party came to power in 1948 and began to build the apartheid structure. When he started his law course at the University of Cape Town in 1952, Woods supported government policies that separated the races, but was wary of the heavy hand of the Afrikaner National Party. During his legal studies he started to question the separatist views he grew up with, becoming politically active in the Federal Party, which rejected apartheid and drew its support from liberal English-speaking whites.

Woods spent two years as a legal apprentice, with the goal of becoming a barrister, but gravitated toward journalism. Just as he was about to embark on his career as a journalist, the 23-year-old Woods was approached by the Federal Party to run for a seat in parliament. His campaign was unsuccessful, and he went back to his job as a cub reporter for the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; newspaper in East London. For two years during the late 1950s, he honed his skills as a journalist by writing and sub-editing for various newspapers in England and Wales. It was while working in Wales that he developed a love and respect for the Welsh people that endured all his life. While working on the &quot;Western Mail&quot; in Cardiff, Woods became friends with colleague Glyn Williams, who later joined him on the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; and eventually became editor himself. Before returning to South Africa, Woods served as a correspondent for London&#x27;s now defunct &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, travelling throughout the eastern and southern United States, eventually arriving in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he filed stories comparing U.S. segregation with South Africa&#x27;s apartheid.

Woods went back to work at the &quot;Dispatch&quot; and married Wendy Bruce, whom he had known since they were teenagers in their hometown. They had six children: Jane, Dillon, Duncan, Gavin, Lindsay, and Mary. Their fourth son, Lindsay, born in 1970, contracted meningitis and died just before his first birthday. The family had settled into a comfortable life in East London, and in February 1965, at the age of 31, Woods rose to the position of editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot;, which held an anti-apartheid editorial policy. As editor, Woods expanded the readership of the &quot;Dispatch&quot; to include Afrikaans-speakers as well as black readers in nearby Transkei and Ciskei. Woods integrated the editorial staff and flouted apartheid policies by seating black, white, and coloured reporters in the same work area. He favoured hiring reporters who had had experience working overseas. Woods had several scrapes with the South African Security Police regarding editorial matters and on numerous occasions ruffled the feathers of Prime Minister B. J. Vorster in frank, face-to-face exchanges regarding the content of &quot;Dispatch&quot; editorials. Woods found himself tiptoeing around, and sometimes directly challenging, the increasingly restrictive government policies enacted to control the South African press.

==Relationship with Steve Biko==

Under Woods, the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot; was very critical of the South African government, but was also initially critical of the emerging Black Consciousness Movement under the leadership of Steve Biko. Mamphela Ramphele, Biko’s partner, berated Woods for writing misleading stories about the movement, challenging him to meet with Biko.

The two men became friends, leading the Security Police to monitor Woods&#x27;s movements. Nevertheless, Woods continued to provide political support to Biko, both through writing editorials in his newspaper and controversially hiring black journalists to the &quot;Daily Dispatch&quot;.

On 16 June 1976, an uprising broke out in Soweto, in which predominantly 13- to 16-year-old students from Soweto participated in a march to protest against being taught in Afrikaans and against the Bantu Education system in general. The police ordered the children to disperse, and when they refused, the police opened fire, killing scores (and by some estimates, hundreds) of them, as the children pelted the police with stones. The government responded by banning the entire Black Consciousness Movement along with many other political organisations, as well as issuing banning orders against various people. Donald Woods was one of them and was effectively placed under house arrest.

Returning to his home on the evening of 18 August 1977, from a trip to Cape Town, Biko was arrested, imprisoned and mortally beaten. He was killed on 12 September. Woods went to the morgue with Biko&#x27;s wife, Ntsiki Mashalaba, and photographed Biko&#x27;s battered body. The photographs were later published in Woods&#x27;s book, exposing the South African government&#x27;s cover-up of the cause of Biko&#x27;s death.

==Life in exile==

Soon after Biko&#x27;s death, Woods was himself placed under a five-year ban. He was stripped of his editorship, and was not allowed to speak publicly, write, travel or work for the duration of his ban. Over the next year, he was subjected to increasing harassment, and his phone was tapped. His six-year-old daughter was severely burned by a T-shirt laced with ninhydrin. Convinced that the government was trying to have him killed, Woods decided to flee South Africa.

Woods and friends Drew Court and Robin Walker devised a plan for him to be smuggled out of his house. Disguised as a Roman Catholic priest, Father &quot;Teddy Molyneaux&quot;, on 30 December 1977, Woods hitchhiked out of town then drove in convoy with Court before attempting to cross the Telle River, a tributary of the Orange River, between South Africa and Lesotho. Following days of steady rain, the river had flooded, leaving him to resort to crossing at the Telle Bridge border crossing in a Lesotho Postal Service truck driven by an unsuspecting Mosotho man, who was merely giving the &quot;priest&quot; a lift.

He made it undetected by South African customs and border officials to Lesotho, where, prompted by a prearranged telephone call, his family joined him shortly afterwards. Once they arrived in Lesotho, Bruce Haigh, a diplomat of the Australian Embassy in South Africa, drove him to Maseru. With the help of the British High Commission (in Maseru) and from the Government of Lesotho, they flew under United Nations passports and with one Lesotho Government official over South African airspace, via Botswana to London where they were granted political asylum.

After arriving in London, Woods became an active spokesman against apartheid. Acting upon the advice of Oliver Tambo, the President of the African National Congress (ANC), Woods became a passionate advocate of nations imposing sanctions against South Africa. He toured the United States campaigning for sanctions against apartheid. The trip included a three-hour session, arranged by President Jimmy Carter, to address officials in the U.S. Department of State. Woods also spoke at a session of the United Nations Security Council in 1978.

On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving twenty-seven years, 17 of those years on Robben Island. That Easter, Mandela came to London to attend a concert at Wembley Stadium to thank the anti-apartheid Movement and the British people for their years of campaigning against apartheid. Woods gave Mandela a tie in the black, green and gold colours of the African National Congress to celebrate the event, which Mandela wore at the concert the next day.

==Return to South Africa==

Woods returned to South Africa in 1994 to support the fundraising efforts for the ANC election fund. His son Dillon was one of the organizers of the fundraising appeal in the United Kingdom. On 27 April 1994, Woods went to vote at the City Hall in Johannesburg. A cheering crowd took him to the head of the queue, giving him the place of honour so that he could be one of the first to vote in the new South Africa. Following the election, Woods worked for the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism in Johannesburg.

On 9 September 1997, on the twentieth anniversary of the death of Steve Biko, Woods was present in East London when a statue of Biko was unveiled by Nelson Mandela and the bridge across the Buffalo River was renamed the &quot;Biko Bridge&quot;. Woods also gave his support to the Action for Southern Africa event in Islington, London honouring Biko, helping to secure messages from Ntsiki Biko, Mamphela Ramphele (then the Vice Chancellor of the University of Cape Town) and Mandela.

==&quot;Cry Freedom&quot;==

Director Richard Attenborough filmed the story of Woods and Steve Biko, based upon the books which Woods had written, under the title &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;. Donald and Wendy Woods became involved in the project, working closely with the actors and crew. The film was shot largely on location in Zimbabwe (South Africa still being under apartheid at the time). It was released in 1987 to critical acclaim, and won several awards. Woods was portrayed by Kevin Kline, who became friends with Woods and his wife and family during the filming. The friendship continued until Woods&#x27; death in 2001. Wendy Woods was played by Penelope Wilton. Biko was played by Denzel Washington, who was Oscar-nominated for the role. At nearly three hours long, the film also featured appearances by John Thaw, Timothy West, Julian Glover, Ian Richardson and Zakes Mokae.

It closes with a list of deaths of black activists in police custody in South Africa, with the official explanations of cause of death.

==Final years==

In the last year of his life, Woods gave his name to support an appeal to erect a statue of Nelson Mandela in Trafalgar Square outside the South African High Commission, where anti-apartheid campaigners had demonstrated during the period of the apartheid regime.

Woods was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000. He died of cancer on 19 August 2001 in London.

The high bronze statue of Mandela was eventually erected on nearby Parliament Square, Westminster City Council. It was unveiled by the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, on 29 August 2007, in the presence of Woods&#x27; widow, Wendy, Nelson Mandela and his wife Graça Machel, and Richard Attenborough.

Wendy died in 2013 from melanoma.

Donald Woods&#x27;s eldest son Dillon Woods is currently the Chief Executive of the East London-based Donald Woods Foundation, which is an educational foundation in South Africa. His son Gavin appears on the Johnny Vaughan show on Radio X.

<text>The University of San Diego (USD) is a private Catholic research university in San Diego, California, United States. Chartered in 1949 as the independent San Diego College for Women and San Diego University (comprising the College for Men and School of Law), the two institutions merged in 1972.

The university includes the College of Arts and Sciences, Hahn School of Nursing and Health Science, Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies, Division of Professional and Continuing Education, Knauss School of Business, School of Law, School of Leadership and Education Services (SOLES), and the Shiley-Marcos School of Engineering. 

USD has 89 undergraduate and graduate programs, and enrolls approximately 9,073 undergraduate, paralegal, graduate and law students. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The San Diego Toreros compete in NCAA Division I (FCS) as a member of the West Coast Conference.

== History ==
Charters were granted in 1949 for the San Diego College for Women and San Diego University, which included the College for Men and School of Law. The College for Women opened its doors to its first class of students in 1952. The Most Reverend Charles F. Buddy, D.D., then bishop of the Diocese of San Diego and Reverend Mother Rosalie Hill, RSCJ, a Superior Vicaress of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, chartered the institution from resources drawn from their respective organizations on a stretch of land known as &quot;Alcalá Park,&quot; named for Didacus of Alcalá. In 1954, the College for Men and the School of Law opened. These two schools originally occupied Bogue Hall on the same site of University High School, which would later become the home of the University of San Diego High School. Starting in 1954, Alcalá Park also served as the diocesan chancery office and housed the episcopal offices, until the diocese moved to a vacated Benedictine convent that was converted to a pastoral center. In 1957, Immaculate Heart Major Seminary and St. Francis Minor Seminary were moved into their newly completed facility, now known as Maher Hall. The Immaculata Chapel, now no longer affiliated with USD, also opened that year as part of the seminary facilities. For nearly two decades, these schools co-existed on Alcalá Park. Immaculate Heart closed at the end of 1968, when its building was renamed De Sales Hall; St. Francis remained open until 1970, when it was transferred to another location on campus, leaving all of the newly named Bishop Leo T. Maher Hall to the newly merged co-educational University of San Diego in 1972. Since then, the university has grown quickly and has been able to increase its assets and academic programs. The student body, the local community, patrons, alumni, and many organizations have been integral to the university&#x27;s development.
Significant periods of expansion of the university, since the 1972 merger, occurred in the mid-1980s, as well as in 1998, when Joan B. Kroc, philanthropist and wife of McDonald&#x27;s financier Ray Kroc, endowed USD with a gift of $25 million for the construction of the Institute for Peace &amp; Justice. Other significant donations to the college came in the form of multimillion-dollar gifts from weight-loss tycoon Jenny Craig, inventor Donald Shiley, investment banker and alumnus Bert Degheri, and an additional gift of $50 million Mrs. Kroc left the School of Peace Studies upon her death. These gifts helped make possible, respectively, the Jenny Craig Pavilion (an athletic arena), the Donald P. Shiley Center for Science and Technology, the Joan B. Kroc School of Peace Studies, and the Degheri Alumni Center. As a result, USD has been able to host the West Coast Conference (WCC) basketball tournament in 2002, 2003 and 2008, and hosted international functions such as the Kyoto Laureate Symposium at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for Peace &amp; Justice and at USD&#x27;s Shiley Theatre. Shiley&#x27;s gift has provided the university with some additional, and more advanced, teaching laboratories than it had previously. In 2005, the university expanded the Colachis Plaza from the Immaculata along Marian Way to the east end of Hall, which effectively closed the east end of the campus to vehicular traffic. That same year, the student body approved plans for a renovation and expansion of the Hahn University Center which began at the end of 2007. The new Student Life Pavilion (SLP) opened in 2009 and hosts the university&#x27;s new student dining area(s), offices for student organizations and event spaces. The Hahn University Center is now home to administrative offices, meeting and event spaces, and a restaurant and wine bar, La Gran Terazza.

In 2022, students began taking classes at the new Knauss Center for Business Education, a 120,000-square-foot complex that serves as an innovation and collaboration ecosystem for business students.

In the spring of 2022, USD&#x27;s total enrollment was 9,041 undergraduate, graduate, paralegal and law students from 85 countries and 50 US states.

== Environment and location ==
Alcalá Park sits atop the edge of a mesa overlooking Mission Bay and provides stunning panoramic views of San Diego.

The philosophy of USD&#x27;s founder and her fellow religious relied on the belief that studying in beautiful surroundings could improve the educational experience of students. Thus, the university&#x27;s buildings are designed in a 16th-century Plateresque architecture, a style of the Spanish Renaissance, paying homage to both San Diego&#x27;s Catholic heritage and the Universidad de Alcalá in Spain.

The campus is located approximately two miles north of downtown San Diego, on the north crest of Mission Valley in the community of Linda Vista. From the westernmost edges of Alcalá Park the communities of Mission Hills, Old Town, Point Loma, Ocean Beach, Bay Park, Mission Beach and Pacific Beach can be seen. Also, the Pacific Ocean, San Diego Bay, the Coronado Islands and La Jolla are visible from the campus.

In February 2022, &quot;Travel+Leisure&quot; named USD campus as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States, and Best Choice Schools ranked it the most beautiful urban campus in the United States.

== Administration ==
Though a Catholic university, the school is no longer governed directly by the Diocese of San Diego. Today, a lay board of trustees governs the university&#x27;s operations. However, the Bishop of San Diego, Robert W. McElroy, retains a seat as a permanent member and retains control of the school&#x27;s designation of &quot;Catholic.&quot;

== Academics ==

USD offers more than 80 degrees at the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels. Students choose from undergraduate and graduate degree programs from the seven schools and college that comprise the University of San Diego:

* Undergraduate Programs: 43 bachelor&#x27;s degrees with many concentrations; 56 minors
* Graduate Programs: 36 master&#x27;s degrees, Juris Doctor (JD), five LLM degrees, four doctorates, dual degree programs

Carnegie gives this ranking to “institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees and had at least $5 million in total research expenditures (as reported through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Higher Education Research &amp; Development Survey (HERD)).”

The School of business was recently renamed to Knauss School of Business after Don Knauss announced to increase the philanthropic giving to the university to $50 million as an investment in educating ethical and compassionate business leaders

<doc id="574668" wikidata="Q981270" url="?curid=574668" title="Serge Dassault">
<text>Serge Dassault (; born Serge Paul André Bloch; 4 April 1925 – 28 May 2018) was a French engineer, businessman and politician. He was the chairman and chief executive officer of Dassault Group, and a conservative politician. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Dassault&#x27;s net worth was estimated in 2016 at US$15 billion.

==Early life and education==
He was the younger son of Madeleine Dassault ( Minckès) and Marcel Dassault (born Marcel Ferdinand Bloch), from whom he inherited the Dassault Group. Both his parents were of Jewish heritage, but later converted to Roman Catholicism. 

In 1929, his father founded what is now Dassault Aviation. During the Second World War, he was jailed when his father was sent to Buchenwald for refusing any cooperation from his company, Bordeaux-Aéronautique, directed by Henri Déplante, André Curvale and Claude de Cambronne, with the German aviation industry.

He studied at the Lycée Janson-de-Sailly in the 16th arrondissement of Paris where he received his baccalauréat. He earned engineering degrees from the École Polytechnique (class of 1946) and Supaéro (class of 1951). In 1963, he received an Executive MBA from HEC Paris.

==Business career==

After his father&#x27;s death in 1986, Serge Dassault continued developing the company, with the help of CEOs Charles Edelstenne and Éric Trappier. His group also owned the newspaper . In December 1998, he was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation in the Belgian Agusta scandal, and was fined 60,000 Belgian francs (about €1,500).

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, the Dassault family also owns a winery, property in Paris, and an art auction house.

==Political career==
Dassault was a member of the Union for a Popular Movement political party, as was his son Olivier, who was a deputy in the National Assembly. He was a former mayor of the city of Corbeil-Essonnes, a southern suburb of Paris.

In 2004, he became a senator, and in that position, he was an outspoken advocate of conservative positions on economic and employment issues, claiming that France&#x27;s taxes and workforce regulations ruin its entrepreneurs. In 2005, he inaugurated the €2 million &quot;Islamic cultural centre&quot; (comprising a mosque) in his city of Corbeil-Essonnes. In November 2012, responding to the Ayrault government&#x27;s plan to legalise same-sex marriage in France, he controversially said, during an interview for &quot;France Culture&quot;, that authorising it would cause &quot;no more renewal of the population. [...] We&#x27;ll have a country of homosexuals. And so in ten years there&#x27;ll be nobody left. It&#x27;s stupid&quot;.

==Personal life and death==

Dassault married Nicole Raffel on 5 July 1950. They had four children: Olivier, Laurent, Thierry, and Marie-Hélène.

He died suddenly in his office at the Dassault Group headquarters in Paris on 28 May 2018, from heart failure at the age of 93.
