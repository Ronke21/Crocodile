<text>Islamic terrorism (also known as Islamist terrorism or radical Islamic terrorism or Jihadi terrorism) refers to terrorist acts carried out by fundamentalist militant Islamists and Islamic extremists.

Since at least the 1990s, Islamist terrorist incidents have occurred around the world and targeted both Muslims and non-Muslims. Most attacks have been concentrated in Muslim-majority countries, with studies finding 80-90% of terrorist victims to be Muslim. 
The annual number of fatalities from terrorist attacks grew sharply from 2011 to 2014 when it reached a peak of 33,438, before declining to 13,826 in 2019. From 1979 to April 2024, five Islamic extremist groups – the Taliban, Islamic State, 
Boko Haram, Al Shabaab, and al-Qaeda – were responsible for more than 80% of all victims of Islamist terrorist attacks. In some of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups. Islamist terrorism has also been roundly condemned by prominent Islamic figures and groups.

Justifications given for attacks on civilians by Islamic extremist groups come from their interpretations of the Quran, the &quot;hadith&quot;, and &quot;sharia&quot; law. These include retribution by armed &quot;jihad&quot; for the perceived injustices of unbelievers against Muslims; the belief that many self-proclaimed Muslims have violated Islamic law and are disbelievers (&quot;takfir&quot;); the perceived necessity of restoring Islam by establishing &quot;sharia&quot; law, including by reestablishing the Caliphate as a pan-Islamic state (e.g. ISIS); the glory and heavenly rewards of martyrdom; and the belief in the supremacy of Islam over all other religions.

The use of the phrase &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; is disputed. In Western political speech, it has variously been called &quot;counter-productive&quot;, &quot;highly politicized, intellectually contestable&quot; and &quot;damaging to community relations&quot;, by those who disapprove of the characterization &#x27;Islamic&#x27;. It has been argued that &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; is a misnomer for what should be called &quot;Islamist terrorism&quot;.

== Terminology ==
George W. Bush and Tony Blair (US president and UK Prime Minister respectively at the time of the September 11 attacks) repeatedly stated that the war against terrorism has nothing to do with Islam. Others inside and out of the Islamic world who oppose its use on the grounds there is no connection between Islam and terrorism include Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, and academic Bruce Lawrence.
Former US president Barack Obama explained why he used the term &quot;terrorism&quot; rather than &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; in a 2016 townhall meeting saying, &quot;There is no doubt, ... terrorist organizations like Al-Qaeda or ISIL – They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death ... But what I have been careful about when I describe these issues is to make sure that we do not lump these murderers into the billion Muslims that exist around the world ...&quot;

It has been argued that &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot; is a misnomer for what should be called &quot;Islamist terrorism&quot;.

In January 2008, the US Department of Homeland Security Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties issued a report titled &quot;Terminology to Define the Terrorists: Recommendations from American Muslims&quot;, which opened with

The office &quot;consulted with some of the leading U.S.-based scholars and commentators on Islam to discuss the best terminology to use when describing the terrorist threat.&quot; Among the experts they consulted,
== History ==
Growth in Islamist attacks and killings around the world
=== Pre-20th century ===
Whether Islamic terrorism is a recent phenomenon is disputed. Some maintain that there was no terrorism in Islam prior to late 20th and early 21st century, while others, such as Ibn Warraq, claim that from the beginning of Islam, &quot;violent movements have arisen&quot; such as the Kharijites, Sahl ibn Salama, Barbahari, Kadizadeli movement, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab, etc., &quot;seeking to revive true Islam, which its members felt had been neglected in Muslim societies, who were not living up to the ideals of the earliest Muslims&quot;. The 7th century Kharijites, according to some, started from an essentially political position but developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Muslims. The group was particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to &quot;takfir&quot;, whereby they declared Muslim opponents to be unbelievers and therefore worthy of death, and also by their strong resemblance to contemporary ISIL.

=== 1960s–1970s ===
During the era of the anti-colonial struggle in North Africa and the Middle East, coinciding with the creation of Israel in 1948, a series of Marxist-Leninist and anti-imperialist movements swept throughout the Arab and Islamic world. These movements were nationalist and revolutionary, but not Islamic. However, their view that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as Al Fatah and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel&#x27;s victory over Arab forces in 1967, Palestinian leaders began to realize that the Arab world was unable to defeat Israel in the battlefield. At the same time, lessons drawn from the Jewish struggle against the British in Palestine and revolutionary movements across Latin America, North Africa and Southeast Asia, motivated the Palestinians to turn away from guerrilla warfare towards urban terrorism. These movements were secular in nature, though their international reach served to spread terrorist tactics worldwide. Moreover, the Arab Cold War between mostly US-aligned conservative Islamic monarchies (Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Jordan) and Soviet-aligned secular national-revolutionary governments (Egypt, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Iraq) inspired a growth of religiously motivated Islamic movements in the Middle East, supported by Saudi Arabia, which came into conflict with the predominant secular (Nasserist and Ba&#x27;athist) nationalist ideologies at the time.

The book &quot;The Revolt&quot; by Menachem Begin, leader of the Irgun militia and future Israeli Prime Minister, influenced both Carlos Marighella&#x27;s urban guerrilla theory and Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Islamist al-Qaeda organization. Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman in the book &quot;Rise and Kill First&quot; asserted that Hezbollah&#x27;s 1983 campaign of coordinated terrorist attacks against American, French and Israeli military installations in Beirut drew inspiration from and directly mirrored the Haganah&#x27;s and Irgun&#x27;s 1946 bombing campaign against the British: both succeeded in creating an atmosphere of widespread fear which eventually forced the enemy to withdraw. Bergman further asserts that the influence of Israeli-sponsored terrorist operations on the emerging Islamists was also of operational nature: the Israeli proxy Front for the Liberation of Lebanon from Foreigners had carried out multiple deadly truck bombings in Lebanon long before the emergence of Hezbollah. An Israeli Mossad agent told Bergman: &quot;I saw from a distance one of the cars blowing up and demolishing an entire street. We were teaching the Lebanese how effective a car bomb could be. Everything that we saw later with Hezbollah sprang from what they saw had happened after these operations.&quot;

The year 1979 is widely considered a turning point in the rise of religiously motivated radicalism in the Muslim world. Several events are thought to be crucial for the proliferation of Islamist terrorism in the next decade, such as the Soviet-Afghan War and unprecedented support from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the US for anti-Soviet jihadists; the Iranian Revolution and subsequent Iran-Iraq War as well as Khomeini&#x27;s active support for Shia groups fighting the Israeli occupation of Lebanon; the Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca and subsequent Wahhabization of the Saudi government; and the Egypt–Israel peace treaty that was highly unpopular in some sections of the Muslim world.

According to Bruce Hoffman of the RAND Corporation, in 1980, 2 out of 64 terrorist groups were categorized as having religious motivation while in 1995, almost half (26 out of 56) were religiously motivated with the majority having Islam as their guiding force.

=== 1980s–1990s ===
The Soviet–Afghan War and the subsequent anti-Soviet mujahedin war, lasting from 1979 to 1989, started the rise and expansion of terrorist groups. Since their beginning in 1994, the Pakistani-supported Taliban militia in Afghanistan has gained several characteristics traditionally associated with state-sponsors of terrorism, providing logistical support, travel documentation, and training facilities. Since 1989 the increasing willingness of religious extremists to strike targets outside immediate country or regional areas highlights the global nature of contemporary terrorism. The 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, and the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, are representative of this trend.

=== 2000s–2010s ===
According to research by the German newspaper &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;, between 11 September 2001 and 21 April 2019, there were 31,221 Islamist terrorism attacks, in which at least 146,811 people were killed. Many of the victims were Muslims, including most of the victims who were killed in attacks involving 12 or more deaths.

=== 2010s ===
According to the Global Terrorism Index, deaths from terrorism peaked in 2014 and have fallen each year since then until 2019 (the last year the study had numbers for), making a decline of more than half (59% or 13,826 deaths) from their peak. The five countries &quot;hardest hit&quot; by terrorism continue to be Muslims countries—Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Syria and Somalia.
== Attacker profiles and motivations ==

The motivation of Islamic terrorists has been disputed. Some (such as Maajid Nawaz, Graeme Wood, and Ibn Warraq) attribute it to extremist interpretations of Islam; others (Mehdi Hasan) to some combination of political grievance and social-psychological maladjustment; and still others (such as James L. Payne and Michael Scheuer) to a struggle against &quot;U.S./Western/Jewish aggression, oppression, and exploitation of Muslim lands and peoples&quot;.

=== Religious motivation ===
Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, in their book, &quot;The Age of Sacred Terror&quot;, argue that Islamic terrorist attacks are motivated by religious fervor. They are seen as &quot;a sacrament ... intended to restore to the universe a moral order that had been corrupted by the enemies of Islam.&quot; Their attacks are neither political nor strategic but an &quot;act of redemption&quot; meant to &quot;humiliate and slaughter those who defied the hegemony of God&quot;.

According to Indonesian Islamic leader Yahya Cholil Staquf in a 2017 &quot;Time&quot; interview, within the classical Islamic tradition the relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims is assumed to be one of segregation and enmity. In his view extremism and terrorism are linked with &quot;the basic assumptions of Islamic orthodoxy&quot; and that radical Islamic movements are nothing new. He also added that Western politicians should stop pretending that extremism is not linked to Islam.

According to journalist Graeme Wood &quot;much of what&quot; one major Islamic terror group -- ISIS -- &quot;does looks nonsensical except in light of a sincere, carefully considered commitment to returning civilization to a seventh-century legal environment&quot; of Muhammad and his companions, &quot;and ultimately to bringing about the apocalypse&quot; and Judgement day. ISIS group members insist &quot;they will not—cannot—waver from governing precepts that were embedded in Islam by the Prophet Muhammad and his earliest followers&quot;.

Shmuel Bar argues that while the importance of political and socioeconomic factors in Islamist terrorism is not in doubt, &quot;In order to comprehend the motivation for these acts and to draw up an effective strategy for a war against terrorism, it is necessary to understand the religious-ideological factors — which are deeply embedded in Islam.&quot;

Examining Europe, two studies of the background of Muslim terrorists—one of the UK and one of France—found little connection between terrorist acts performed in the name of Islam and the religious piety of the operatives. A &quot;restricted&quot; 2008 UK report of hundreds of case studies by the domestic counter-intelligence agency MI5 found that there was no &quot;typical profile&quot; of a terrorist, and that

However, while the motivation of the individuals directly involved in carrying out the terror attacks are not necessarily religious and may stem from other reasons, religiously motivated organizations and governments are very often behind such attacks. Fundamentalist organizations and governments often encourage, fund, assist, incentivize or reward the actions of individuals they recognize as susceptible to be coerced into committing terror attacks, thus using people who are not always religiously motivated themselves to achieve religious ends. Hamas, for example, is known for paying the families of imprisoned terrorists and of suicide bombers. The Islamic Republic of Iran intends billions of US dollars annually for militia fighters and terrorists, exploiting the extreme economic difficulties faced by people in countries such as Yemen, Lebanon and Syria by offering them cash in exchange for terror activity.

A 2015 &quot;general portrait&quot; of &quot;the conditions and circumstances&quot; under which people living in France become &quot;Islamic radicals&quot; (terrorists or would-be terrorists) by Olivier Roy (see above) found radicalisation was not an &quot;uprising of a Muslim community that is victim to poverty and racism: only young people join, including converts&quot;.

Roy believes terrorism/radicalism is &quot;expressed in religious terms&quot; because

# most of the radicals have a Muslim background, which makes them open to a process of re-Islamisation (&quot;almost none of them having been pious before entering the process of radicalisation&quot;), and
# jihad is &quot;the only cause on the global market&quot;. If you kill in silence, it will be reported by the local newspaper; &quot;if you kill yelling &#x27;Allahu Akbar&#x27;, you are sure to make the national headlines&quot;. Other extreme causes—ultra-left or radical ecology are &quot;too bourgeois and intellectual&quot; for the radicals.

Somewhat in contradiction to this, a study surveying Muslims in Europe to examine how much Islamist ideology increases support for terrorism, found that &quot;in Western countries affected by homegrown terrorism ... justifying terrorism is strongly associated with an increase in religious practice&quot;. (This is not the case in European &quot;countries where Muslims are predominant&quot;—Bosnia, Albania, etc. -- where the opposite seems to be true, i.e. the more importance respondents assigned to religion in their life, the less likely they were to &quot;justifying political violence&quot;.)

==== Denominations/Ideologies ====
Most strains of thought/schools/sects/movements/denominations/traditions of Islam do not support or otherwise associate themselves with terrorism.
According to Mir Faizal, only three sects or movements of Islam—the Sunni sects of Salafi, Deobandi, and Barelvi.—have been associated with violence against civilians. Of the three, only Salafi Islam—specifically Salafi jihadism Islam—can be called involved in global terrorism, as it is connected with Al-Qaeda, ISIS, Boko Haram and other groups. (Terrorism among some members of the Barelvi sect is limited to attacks on alleged blasphemers in Pakistan, and the terrorism among Deobandi groups has &quot;almost no&quot; influence beyond Afghanistan, Pakistan and Indian.) Another sect/movement known as Wahhabism (intertwined with &quot;non&quot;-jihadist Salafism) has been accused of being the ideology behind Islamic terrorist groups, but Al Qaeda and other terrorists are more commonly described as following a &quot;fusion&quot; of Qutbism and Wahhabism.

Outside of these sects or religious movements, the religious ideology of Qutbism has influenced Islamic terrorism, along with religious themes and trends including Takfir, suicide attacks, and the belief that Jews and Christians are not People of the Book but infidels/kafir waging &quot;war on Islam&quot;. (These ideas are often related and overlapping.)

===== Qutbism =====
Qutbism is named after Egyptian Islamist theoretician Sayyid Qutb, who wrote a manifesto (known as &quot;Milestones&quot;), while in prison. Qutb is said to have laid out
the ideological foundation of Salafi jihadism (according to Bruce Livesey); his ideas are said to have formed &quot;the modern Islamist movement&quot; (according to Gilles Kepel);
which along with other &quot;violent Islamic thought&quot;, became the ideology known as &quot;Qutbism that is the &quot;center of gravity&quot; of al-Qaeda and related groups (according to U.S. Army Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier).
Qutb is thought to be a major influence on Al-Qaeda #2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri.

In his manifesto (called &quot;one of the most influential works in Arabic of the last half century&quot;), Qutb preached:
* the absolute necessity of enforcement of sharia law (&quot;even more necessary than the establishment of the Islamic belief&quot;, without which Islam does not exist);
* the need for violent jihad as well as preaching to bring back sharia law and spread Islam, (a vanguard &quot;movement&quot; will use &quot;physical power and Jihad&quot;, to remove &quot;material obstacles&quot;);
* that offensive jihad—attacking non-Muslim territory—ought not neglected by true Muslims in favor of defensive jihad, (this &quot;diminish[s] the greatness of the Islamic way of life&quot;, and is the work of those who have been &quot;defeated by the attacks of the treacherous Orientalists!&quot; Muslims should not let lack of non-Muslim aggression stop them from waging Jihad to spread sharia law because &quot;truth and falsehood cannot coexist on earth&quot; in peace.
* a loathing of &quot;the West&quot; (a &quot;rubbish heap ... filth ... hollow and worthless&quot;);
* ... which is deliberately undermining Islam (pursuing a &quot;well-thought-out scheme&quot; to &quot;demolish the structure of Muslim society&quot;);
* ... despite the fact it &quot;knows&quot; it is inferior to Islam (It &quot;knows that it does not possess anything which will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence&quot;, so that when confronted with the &quot;logic, beauty, humanity and happiness&quot; of Islam, &quot;the American people blush&quot;);
* and a loathing and hatred of Jews (&quot;world Jewry, whose purpose is to eliminate ... the limitations imposed by faith and religion, so that Jews may penetrate into body politics of the whole world and then may be free to perpetuate their evil designs [such as] usury, the aim of which is that all the wealth of mankind end up in the hands of Jewish financial institutions ...&quot;).

Eikmeier summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:
* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to &quot;pure Islam&quot; as originally practiced during the time of Muhammad.
* The path to that &quot;pure Islam&quot; is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the Quran and Hadith, along with implementation of Muhammad&#x27;s commands.
* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.
* Any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the classical jurisprudential tradition is mere sophistry.

While Sayyid Qutb preached that &quot;all&quot; of the Muslim world had become apostate or &quot;jahiliyah&quot;, he did not specifically takfir or call for the execution of any apostates, even those governing non-sharia governments Qutb did however emphasize that &quot;the organizations and authorities&quot; of the putatively Muslim countries were irredeemably corrupt and evil and would have to be abolished by &quot;physical power and Jihad&quot;, by a &quot;vanguard&quot; movement of true Muslims.

One who did argue this was Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj, the main theoretician of the Islamist group that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. who in his book &quot;Al-Farida al-gha&#x27;iba&quot; (The Neglected Duty), cited a fatwa issued in 1303 CE by the celebrated strict medieval jurist Ibn Taymiyyah. He had ruled that fighting and killing of the Mongol invaders who were invading Syria was not only permitted but obligatory according to Sharia. This was because the Mongols did not follow sharia law, and so even though they had converted to Islam (Ibn Taymiyyah argued) they were not really Muslims. Faraj preached that rulers such as Anwar Sadat were &quot;rebels against the Laws of God [the shari&#x27;ah]&quot;, and &quot;apostates from Islam&quot; who have preserved nothing of Islam except its name.

===== Wahabism/Salafism =====
Another Islamic movement accused of being involved in terrorism is known as Wahabism.

Sponsored by oil exporting power Saudi Arabia, Wahabism is deeply conservative and anti-revolutionary (its founder taught that Muslims are obliged to give unquestioned allegiance to their ruler, however imperfect, so long as he leads the community according to the laws of God),
Nonetheless, this ideology and its sponsors have been accused of assisting terrorism both
* indirectly—by &quot;creating&quot; an environment from late 1970s to 2010 that &quot;supported the spread of extremist ideologies&quot;; despite its conservatism, Wahhabism shares important doctrinal points with forms of Islamism—a strong &quot;revulsion&quot; against Western influences, a belief in strict implementation of injunctions and prohibitions of &quot;sharia&quot; law, an opposition to both Shia Islam and popular Islamic religious practices (the veneration of Muslim saints), and a belief in the importance of armed jihad.
* and directly—through inadvertent and intentional funding of terrorist groups and through its influence on at least two major terrorist groups -- the Taliban and the Islamic State.

Up until at least 2017 or so (when Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman declared Saudi Arabia was returning to &quot;moderate Islam&quot;),
Saudi Arabia spent many billions, not only through the Saudi government but through Islamic organizations, religious charities, and private sources,
on &quot;dawah wahhabiya&quot;, i.e. spreading the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam,
This funding incentivized Muslim &quot;schools, book publishers, magazines, newspapers, or even governments&quot; around the world to &quot;shape their behavior, speech, and thought in such a way as to incur and benefit from Saudi largesse,&quot; and so propagate Wahhabi doctrines;

The hundreds of Islamic colleges and Islamic centers, over a thousand mosques and schools for Muslim children, it financed 
often featured Wahhabi-friendly curriculum and religious materials
such as textbooks explaining that all forms of Islam except Wahhabism were deviation, or the twelfth grade Saudi text that &quot;instructs students that it is a religious obligation to do &#x27;battle&#x27; against infidels in order to spread the faith&quot;.

Wahhabi-friendly works distributed for free &quot;financed by petroleum royalties&quot; included those of Ibn Taymiyyah (author of the fatwa mentioned above against rulers who do not rule by sharia law).

Not least, the successful 1980–1990 jihad against Soviet occupation of Afghanistan—that inspired non-Afghan jihad veterans to continue jihad in their own country or other—benefited from billions of dollars in Saudi financing, as well as &quot;weaponry and intelligence&quot;.
==== Religious interpretations ====
The &quot;root cause&quot; of Muslim terrorism is extremist ideology, according to Pakistani theologian Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, specifically the teachings that:
* &quot;Only Muslims have the right to rule, non-Muslims are meant to be subjugated&quot;;
* &quot;Modern nation states are unIslamic and constitute kufr (disbelief)&quot;;
* the only truly Islamic form of state is a unified Muslim Caliphate;
* &quot;when Muslims obtain power they will overthrow non-Muslim governments and rule&quot;;
* &quot;The punishment of kufr (disbelief) and irtidad (apostasy) is death and must be implemented&quot;.
Other authors have noted other elements of extremist Islamic ideology.

=====Martyrdom/Istishhad=====

Terror attacks requiring the death of the attacker are generally referred to as suicide attacks/bombings by the media, but when done by Islamists their perpetrators generally call such an attack &quot;Istishhad&quot; (or in English &quot;martyrdom operation&quot;), and the suicide attacker &quot;shahid&quot; (pl. &quot;shuhada&quot;, literally &#x27;witness&#x27; and usually translated as &#x27;martyr&#x27;). The idea being that the attacker died in order to testify his faith in God, for example while waging &quot;jihad bis saif&quot; (jihad by the sword). The term &quot;suicide&quot; is never used because Islam has strong strictures against taking one&#x27;s own life.

According to author Sadakat Kadri, &quot;the very idea that Muslims might blow themselves up for God was unheard of before 1983, and it was not until the early 1990s that anyone anywhere had tried to justify killing innocent Muslims who were not on a battlefield.&quot; After 1983 the process was limited among Muslims to Hezbollah and other Lebanese Shi&#x27;a factions for more than a decade.

Since then, the &quot;vocabulary of martyrdom and sacrifice&quot;, videotaped pre-confession of faith by attackers have become part of &quot;Islamic cultural consciousness&quot;, &quot;instantly recognizable&quot; to Muslims (according to Noah Feldman), while the tactic has spread through the Muslim world &quot;with astonishing speed and on a surprising course&quot;.

;Jihadist comparisons of life and death

Below are jihadist statements comparing life and death:
* &quot;We love death like our enemies love life&quot; (Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Al-Aqsa TV in 2014)
* &quot;The Americans love Pepsi-Cola, we love death.&quot; (Afghan jihadist Maulana Inyadullah addressing a British reporter in 2001)
* &quot;The world is but a passage ... what is called life in this world is not life but death&quot; (Ayatollah Khomeini in 1977, commemorating his son&#x27;s death)
* &quot;...The sons of the land of the two holiest sites [Mecca and Medina] ... I say this to you, These youths love death as you love life&quot; (Osama bin Laden addressing U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry in 1996 fatwa)

=====Justification for killing noncombatants =====
Al-Qaeda justification for the killing of civilian bystanders following its first attack (see above) based on a Ibn Taymiyyah&#x27;s fatwa was described by author Lawrence Wright,
An influential tract &quot;Management of Savagery&quot; (&quot;Idarat at-Tawahhush&quot;), explains away mass killing in part by the fact that even &quot;if the whole umma [community of Muslims] perishes they would all be martyrs&quot;. Similarly, author Ali A. Rizvi has described the chat room reaction of a Taliban supporter to his (Rizvi&#x27;s) condemnation of the 2014 Peshawar school massacre—that the 132 school children the Taliban slaughtered were &quot;not dead&quot; because they had been killed &quot;in the way of God ... Don&#x27;t call them dead. They are alive, but we don&#x27;t perceive it&quot; (citing, Never think of those martyred in the cause of Allah as dead. In fact, they are alive with their Lord, well provided for—), and maintaining that those whose Islamic faith is &quot;pure&quot; would not be upset with the Taliban&#x27;s murder of children either.

===== &quot;War against Islam&quot; =====

A tenant of Qutbism and other militant Islamists is that Western policies and society are not just un-Islamic or exploitive, but actively anti-Islamic, or as it is sometimes described, waging a &quot;war against Islam&quot;. Islamists (such as Qutb) often identify what they see as a historical struggle between Christianity and Islam, dating back as far as the Crusades, among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions.

In 2006, Britain&#x27;s then head of MI5 Eliza Manningham-Buller said of Al-Qaeda that it &quot;has developed an ideology which claims that Islam is under attack, and needs to be defended&quot;. &quot;This,&quot; she said &quot;is a powerful narrative that weaves together conflicts from across the globe, presenting the West&#x27;s response to varied and complex issues, from long-standing disputes such as Israel/Palestine and Kashmir to more recent events as evidence of an across-the-board determination to undermine and humiliate Islam worldwide.&quot; She said that the video wills of British suicide bombers made it clear that they were motivated by perceived worldwide and long-standing injustices against Muslims; an extreme and minority interpretation of Islam promoted by some preachers and people of influence; their interpretation as anti-Muslim of UK foreign policy, in particular the UK&#x27;s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot;

In his call for jihad, Osama bin Laden almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his action against them as defensive.

===== Enmity towards non-Muslims and LGBT+ =====
The enmity towards non-Muslims among Islamist militants, leaders and scholars is driven by theological beliefs that deem Christians and Jews as &quot;infidels&quot;. This hostility is further extended to Western society due to its secular values and practices, which are viewed as contrary to Islamic principles. These include issues such as the proliferation of pornography, perceived immorality, and the acceptance of homosexuality and feminism.

An example of this ideological stance in practice was provided by Karam Kuhdi, an Islamist arrested in Egypt in 1981 for his involvement in a series of robberies and murders targeting Christian goldsmiths. In this period, tourists, often non-Muslim, were also frequently targeted by Islamic terrorists in Egypt. During police interrogation, Kuhdi surprised authorities with his unconventional beliefs. He rejected the traditional Islamic doctrine that Christians were &quot;People of the Book&quot; entitled to protection as &quot;dhimmis&quot;, instead considering them infidels subject to violent jihad. Kuhdi supported his stance by citing Quranic verses such as &#x27;Those who say that God is Jesus, son of Mary, are infidels&#x27; and &#x27;combat those of the people of the book who are infidels&#x27;, explaining the Islamists view that the infidels are &quot;the People of the Book, since they have not believed in this book&quot;.

According to a doctrine known as &quot;al-wala&#x27; wa al-bara″&quot; (literally, &quot;loyalty and disassociation&quot;), Wahhabi founder Abd al-Wahhab argued that it was &quot;imperative for Muslims not to befriend, ally themselves with, or imitate non-Muslims or heretical Muslims&quot;, and that this &quot;enmity and hostility of Muslims toward non-Muslims and heretical had to be visible and unequivocal&quot;.

Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about the need for jihad in his messages, in his &quot;Letter to America&quot;, he answered the question, &quot;What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?&quot; with:

This principle has been emphasized by Ayman al-Zawahiri (leader of al-Qaeda since June 2011), Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi (Jihadi theorist), Hamoud al-Aqla al-Shu&#x27;aybi (conservative Sudi scholar who supported the 9/11 attacks), and a number of Salafi preachers, Ahmad Musa Jibril, Abdullah el-Faisal.

Following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, described as an &quot;act of hate&quot; and an &quot;act of terror by President Barack Obama due to the victims being customers of an LGBT nightclub,&lt; allegedly targeted in retaliation for American airstrikes against ISIS. According to the Clarion Project, the official ISIS magazine Dabiq responded: &quot;A hate crime? Yes. Muslims undoubtedly hate liberalist sodomites. An act of terrorism? Most definitely. Muslims have been commanded to terrorize the disbelieving enemies of Allah&quot;. During the shooting, the shooter said it was an act of retaliation for the airstrike killing of Abu Waheeb and three other alleged militants the previous month. He told the negotiator to tell America to stop the bombing. His words were: &quot;That&#x27;s what triggered it, OK? They should have not bombed and killed Abu [Waheeb]&quot;.

===== Takfir =====

According to traditional Islamic law, the blood of someone who leaves Islam is &quot;forfeit&quot;—i.e. they are condemned to death. This applies not only to self-proclaimed ex-Muslims, but to those who still believe themselves to be Muslims but who (in the eyes of their accusers) have deviated too far from orthodoxy. 

Many contemporary liberal/modernist/reformist Muslims believe killing appostates to be in violation of the Quranic injunction &#x27;There is no compulsion in religion...&#x27; (Al-Baqara 256), but even earlier generations of Islamic scholars warned against making such accusations (known as &quot;takfir&quot;), without great care and usually reserved the punishment of death for &quot;extreme, persistent and aggressive&quot; proponents of religious innovation (&quot;bidʻah&quot;). The danger, according to some (such as Gilles Kepel), was that &quot;used wrongly or unrestrainedly, ... Muslims might resort to mutually excommunicating one another and thus propel the Ummah to complete disaster.&quot;

Kepel noted that some of Qutb&#x27;s early followers believed that his declaration that the Muslim world has reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance (Jahiliyyah), should be taken literally and everyone outside of their movement takfired; and Wahhabis has been known for their willingness to takfir non-Wahhabi Muslims.

Since the last half of the 20th century, a &quot;central ideology&quot; of insurgent Wahhabist/Salafi jihadist groups has been the &quot;sanctioning&quot; of &quot;violence against leaders&quot; of Muslim majority states who do not enforce sharia (Islamic law) or are otherwise &quot;deemed insufficiently religious&quot;.
Some insurgent groups -- Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya of Egypt, and later GIA, the Taliban, and ISIL) -- are thought to have gone even further, applying takfir and its capital punishment against not only to Sunni government authorities and Shia Muslims, but to ordinary Sunni civilians who disagree with/disobeyed insurgent policies such as reinstituting slavery.

In 1977, the group &quot;Jama&#x27;at al-Muslimin&quot; (known to the public as &quot;Takfir wal-Hijra&quot;), kidnapped and later killed an Islamic scholar and former Egyptian government minister Muhammad al-Dhahabi. The founder of &quot;Jama&#x27;at al-Muslimin&quot;, Shukri Mustaf had been imprisoned with Sayyid Qutb, and had become one of Qutb&#x27;s &quot;most radical&quot; disciples. He believed that not only was the Egyptian government apostate, but so was &quot;Egyptian society as a whole&quot; because it was &quot;not fighting the Egyptian government and had thus accepted rule by non-Muslims&quot;. While police broke up the group, it reorganized with thousands of members, some of whom went on to help assassinate the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, and join the Algerian Civil War and Al-Qaeda. During the 1990s, a violent Islamic insurgency in Egypt, primarily perpetrated by Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya, targeted not only police and government officials but also civilians, killing or wounding 1106 persons in one particularly bloody year (1993).

In the brutal 1991–2002 Algerian Civil War, takfir of the general Algerian public was known to have been declared by the hardline Islamist Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA). The GIA amir, Antar Zouabri claimed credit for two massacres of civilians (Rais and Bentalha massacres), calling the killings an &quot;offering to God&quot; and declaring impious the victims and all Algerians who had not joined its ranks. He declared that &quot;except for those who are with us, all others are apostates and deserving of death,&quot; (Tens, and sometimes hundreds, of civilians were killed in each of a series of massacres that started in April 1998. However, how many murders were the doing of GIA and how many of the security forces—who had infiltrated the insurgents and were not known for their probity—is not known.)

In August 1998 the Taliban insurgents slaughtered 8000 mostly Shia Hazara non-combatants in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. Comments by Mullah Niazi, the Taliban commander of the attack and newly installed governor, declared in a number of post-slaughter speeches from Mosques in Mazar-i-Sharif: &quot;Hazaras are not Muslim, they are Shi&#x27;a. They are kofr [infidels]. The Hazaras killed our force here, and now we have to kill Hazaras. ... You either accept to be Muslims or leave Afghanistan. ...&quot;, indicated that along with revenge, and/or ethnic hatred, takfir was a motive for the slaughter.

From its inception in 2013 to 2020, directly or through affiliated groups, Daesh), &quot;has been responsible for 27,947 terrorist deaths&quot;, the majority of these have been Muslims, &quot;because it has regarded them as kafir&quot;.

One example of Daesh takfir is found in the 13th issue of its magazine &quot;Dabiq&quot;, which dedicated &quot;dozens of pages ... to attacking and explaining the necessity of killing Shia&quot;, who the group refers to by the label &quot;Rafidah&quot;
Daesh not only called for the revival of slavery of non-Muslims (specifically of the Yazidi minority group), but declared takfir on any Muslim who disagreed with their policy.
Starting in 2013, Daesh began &quot;encouraging takfir of Muslims deemed insufficiently pure in regard of &quot;tawhid&quot; (monotheism)&quot;. The Taliban were found &quot;to be &quot;a &#x27;nationalist&#x27; movement, all too tolerant&quot; of Shia. In 2015 ISIL &quot;pronounced Jabhat al-Nusrat -- then al-Qaida&#x27;s affiliate in Syria -- an apostate group.&quot;

===== Interpretations of the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith =====
Donald Holbrook, a Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, analyzes a sample of 30 works by jihadist propagandists for references to Islamic scripture that justifies the objectives of violent jihad. An-Nisa (4:74–75) is quoted most frequently; other popular passages are At-Taubah (9:13–15, 38–39, 111), Al-Baqarah (2:190–191, 216), and Surah 9:5:

Holbrook notes that the first part &quot;slay the idolaters ...&quot; is oft quoted but not the limiting factors at the end of the ayat.

==== Jihad and Islamic jurisprudence ====
Techniques of war are restricted by classical Islamic jurisprudence, but its scope is not. Bernard Lewis states that ultimately Jihad ends when the entire world is brought under Islamic rule and law. Classical Islamic jurisprudence imposes, without limit of time or space, the duty to subjugate non-Muslims, (according to Lewis). Wael Hallaq writes that some radical Islamists go beyond the classical theory to insist that the purpose of jihad is to overthrow regimes oppressing Muslims and bring non-Muslims to convert to Islam. In contrast, Islamic modernists–who Islamists despise–view jihad as defensive and compatible with modern standards of warfare. To justify their acts of religious violence, jihadist individuals and networks resort to the nonbinding genre of Islamic legal literature (&quot;fatwa&quot;) developed by jihadi-Salafist legal authorities, whose legal writings are shared and spread via the Internet.

;Al-Qaeda
While Islamic opponents of attacks on civilians have quoted numerous prophetic hadith and hadith by Muhammad&#x27;s first successor Abu Bakr, Al-Qaeda believes its attacks are religiously justified.
After its first attack on a US target that killed civilians instead (a 1992 bombing of a hotel in Aden Yemen), Al Qaeda justified the killing of civilian bystanders through an interpretation (by one Abu Hajer) based on medieval jurist Ibn Taymiyyah (see above).

In a post-9/11 work, &quot;A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington&quot;, Al-Qaeda provided a more systematic justification—one that provided &quot;ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation.&quot; Among these justifications are that America is leading the countries of the West in waging war on Islam, which (al-Qaeda alleges) targets &quot;Muslim women, children and elderly&quot;. This means any attacks on America are a defense of Islam, and any treaties and agreements between Muslim majority states and Western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void. Other justifications for killing and situations where killings is allowed based on precedents in early Islamic history include: killing non-combatants when it is too difficult to distinguish between them and combatants when attacking an enemy &quot;stronghold&quot; (&quot;hist&quot;), and/or non-combatants remain in enemy territory; killing those who assist the enemy &quot;in deed, word, mind&quot;, this includes civilians since they can vote in elections that bring enemies of Islam to power; necessity of killing in the war to protect Islam and Muslims; when the prophet was asked whether Muslim fighters could use the catapult against the village of Taif, even though the enemy fighters were mixed with a civilian population, he indicated in the affirmative; killing women, children and other protected groups is allowed when they serve as human shields for the enemy; killing of civilians is permitted if the enemy has broken a treaty.
Supporters of bin Laden have pointed to reports according to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad attacked towns at night or with catapults, and argued that he must have condoned incidental harm to noncombatants, since it would have been impossible to distinguish them from combatants during such attacks. These arguments were not widely accepted by Muslims.

;&quot;Management of Savagery&quot;
Al-Qaeda&#x27;s splinter groups and competitors, Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, are thought to have been heavily influenced by a 2004 work on jihad entitled &quot;Management of Savagery&quot; (&quot;Idarat at-Tawahhush&quot;), written by Abu Bakr Naji and intended to provide a strategy to create a new Islamic caliphate by first destroying &quot;vital economic and strategic targets&quot; and terrifying the enemy with cruelty to break its will.

The tract asserts that &quot;one who previously engaged in jihad knows that it is naught but violence, crudeness, terrorism, deterrence and massacring,&quot; and that even &quot;the most abominable of the levels of savagery&quot; of jihad are better &quot;than stability under the order of unbelief&quot;—those orders being any regime other than ISIL.
Victims should not only be beheaded, shot, burn alive in cages or gradually submerged until drowned, but these events should be publicized with videos and photographs.

;&quot;The Jurisprudence of Blood&quot;
Some observers have noted the evolution in the rules of jihad—from the original &quot;classical&quot; doctrine to that of 21st-century Salafi jihadism. According to the legal historian Sadarat Kadri, during the last couple of centuries, incremental changes in Islamic legal doctrine (developed by Islamists who otherwise condemn any &quot;bid&#x27;ah&quot; (innovation) in religion), have &quot;normalized&quot; what was once &quot;unthinkable&quot;. &quot;The very idea that Muslims might blow themselves up for God was unheard of before 1983, and it was not until the early 1990s that anyone anywhere had tried to justify killing innocent Muslims who were not on a battlefield.&quot;

The first or the &quot;classical&quot; doctrine of jihad which was developed towards the end of the 8th century, emphasized the &quot;jihad of the sword&quot; (&quot;jihad bil-saif&quot;) rather than the &quot;jihad of the heart&quot;, but it contained many legal restrictions which were developed from interpretations of both the Quran and the Hadith, such as detailed rules involving &quot;the initiation, the conduct, the termination&quot; of jihad, the treatment of prisoners, the distribution of booty, etc. Unless there was a sudden attack on the Muslim community, jihad was not a &quot;personal obligation&quot; (&quot;fard &#x27;ayn&quot;); instead it was a &quot;collective one&quot; (&quot;fard al-kifaya&quot;), which had to be discharged &quot;in the way of God&quot; (&quot;fi sabil Allah&quot;), and it could only be directed by the caliph, &quot;whose discretion over its conduct was all but absolute.&quot; (This was designed in part to avoid incidents like the Kharijia&#x27;s jihad against and killing of Caliph Ali, since they deemed that he was no longer a Muslim). Martyrdom resulting from an attack on the enemy with no concern for your own safety was praiseworthy, but dying by your own hand (as opposed to the enemy&#x27;s) merited a special place in Hell. The category of jihad which is considered to be a collective obligation is sometimes simplified as &quot;offensive jihad&quot; in Western texts.

Based on the 20th-century interpretations of Sayyid Qutb, Abdullah Azzam, Ruhollah Khomeini, al-Qaeda and others, many if not all of those self-proclaimed jihad fighters believe that defensive global jihad is a personal obligation, which means that no caliph or Muslim head of state needs to declare it. Killing yourself in the process of killing the enemy is an act of martyrdom and it brings you a special place in Heaven, not a special place in Hell; and the killing of Muslim bystanders (nevermind Non-Muslims), should not impede acts of jihad. Military and intelligent analyst Sebastian Gorka described the new interpretation of jihad as the &quot;willful targeting of civilians by a non-state actor through unconventional means.&quot;

Islamic theologian Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir has been identified as one of the key theorists and ideologues behind modern jihadist violence. His theological and legal justifications influenced Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaeda member and former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, as well as several other jihadi terrorist groups, including ISIL and Boko Haram. Zarqawi used a 579-page manuscript of al-Muhajir&#x27;s ideas at AQI training camps that were later deployed by ISIL, known in Arabic as &quot;Fiqh al-Dima&quot; and referred to in English as &quot;The Jurisprudence of Jihad&quot; or &quot;The Jurisprudence of Blood&quot;. The book has been described by counter-terrorism scholar Orwa Ajjoub as rationalizing and justifying &quot;suicide operations, the mutilation of corpses, beheading, and the killing of children and non-combatants&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s journalist Mark Towsend, citing Salah al-Ansari of Quilliam, notes: &quot;There is a startling lack of study and concern regarding this abhorrent and dangerous text [&quot;The Jurisprudence of Blood&quot;] in almost all Western and Arab scholarship&quot;. Charlie Winter of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; describes it as a &quot;theological playbook used to justify the group&#x27;s abhorrent acts&quot;. He states:

Clinical psychologist Chris E. Stout also discusses the al Muhajir-inspired text in his essay, &quot;Terrorism, Political Violence, and Extremism&quot; (2017). He assesses that jihadists regard their actions as being &quot;for the greater good&quot;; that they are in a &quot;weakened in the earth&quot; situation that renders Islamic terrorism a valid means of solution.

=== Economic motivation ===

Following the 9/11 attack, commentators noted the poverty of Afghanistan, and speculated that blame might partly fall on a lack of a &quot;higher priority to health, education, and economic development&quot; funding by richer countries, and &quot;stagnant economies and a paucity of jobs&quot; in poorer countries.

Among the acts of oppression against Muslims by the United States and its allies alleged by the head of Al-Qaeda, are economic exploitation. In a 6 October 2002 message by Osama bin Laden &#x27;Letter to America&#x27;, he alleges

In a 1997 interview, he claimed that &quot;since 1973, the price of petrol has increased only $8/barrel while the prices of other items have gone up three times. The oil prices should also have gone up three times but this did not happen&quot;, (On the other hand, in an interview five weeks after the destruction the World Trade Center towers his operation was responsible for, bin Laden described the towers as standing for—or &quot;preaching&quot;—not exploitation or capitalism, but &quot;freedom human Rights, and equality&quot;.)

In 2002, academics Alan B. Krueger and Jitka Maleckova found &quot;a careful review of the evidence provides little reason for optimism that a reduction in poverty or an increase in educational attainment would by themselves, meaningfully reduce international terrorism.&quot; Alberto Abadie found &quot;the risk of terrorism is not significantly higher for poorer countries, once other country-specific characteristics are considered&quot;, but instead seems to correlate with a country&#x27;s &quot;level of political freedom&quot;.

Martin Kramer has argued that while terrorist organizers are seldom poor, their &quot;foot-soldiers&quot; often are. Andrew Whitehead states that &quot;poverty creates opportunity&quot; for terrorists, who have hired desperate poor children to do grunt work in Iraq and won the loyalty of poor in Lebanon by providing social services.

=== Western foreign policy ===
Many believe that groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS are reacting to aggression by non-Muslim (especially US) powers, and that religious beliefs are overstated if not irrelevant in their motivation.
According to a graph by U.S. State Department, terrorist attacks escalated worldwide following the United States&#x27; 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and 2003 invasion of Iraq. Dame Eliza Manningham Buller, the former head of MI5, told the Iraq inquiry, the security services warned Tony Blair launching the War on Terror would increase the threat of terrorism. Robert Pape has argued that at least terrorists utilizing suicide attacks—a particularly effective form of terrorist attack—are driven not by Islamism but by &quot;a clear strategic objective: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from the territory that the terrorists view as their homeland&quot;. However, Martin Kramer, who debated Pape on origins of suicide bombing, stated that the motivation for suicide attacks is not just strategic logic but also an interpretation of Islam to provide a moral logic. For example, Hezbollah initiated suicide bombings after a complex reworking of the concept of martyrdom. Kramer explains that the Israeli occupation of the South Lebanon Security Zone raised the temperature necessary for this reinterpretation of Islam, but occupation alone would not have been sufficient for suicide terrorism. &quot;The only way to apply a brake to suicide terrorism,&quot; Kramer argues, &quot;is to undermine its moral logic, by encouraging Muslims to see its incompatibility with their own values.&quot;

Breaking down the content of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s statements and interviews collected in Bruce Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Messages to the World&quot; (Lawrence shares Payne&#x27;s belief in US imperialism and aggression as the cause of Islamic terrorism), James L. Payne found that 72% of the content was on the theme of &quot;criticism of U.S./Western/Jewish aggression, oppression, and exploitation of Muslim lands and peoples&quot; while only 1% of bin Laden&#x27;s statements focused on criticizing &quot;American society and culture&quot;.

Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer argues that terrorist attacks (specifically al-Qaeda attacks on targets in the United States) are &quot;not&quot; motivated by a religiously inspired hatred of American culture or religion, but by the belief that U.S. foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East, condensed in the phrase &quot;They hate us for what we do, not who we are.&quot; U.S. foreign policy actions Scheuer believes are fueling Islamic terror include: the US–led intervention in Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq; Israel–United States relations, namely, financial, military, and political support for Israel; U.S. support for &quot;apostate&quot; police states in Muslim nations such as Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, and Kuwait; U.S. support for the creation of an independent East Timor from territory previously held by Muslim Indonesia; perceived U.S. approval or support of actions against Muslim insurgents in India, the Philippines, Chechnya, and Palestine.

Maajid Nawaz and Sam Harris argue that in many cases there is simply no connection between acts of Islamic extremism and Western intervention in Muslim lands.
Nawaz also argues that suicide bombers in non-Muslim majority countries such as the 7 July 2005 bombers can be said to motivated by ideology not by any desire to compel UK military to withdraw from &quot;their homeland&quot;, as they were born and raised in Yorkshire. They had never set foot in Iraq and do not speak its language.

=== Socio-psychological motivations ===

==== Socio-psychological development ====
A motivator of violent radicalism (not just found in Al-Qaeda and ISIS) is psychological development during adolescence.
Cally O&#x27;Brien found many terrorists were &quot;not exposed to the West in a positive context, whether by simple isolation or conservative family influence, until well after they had established a personal and social identity.&quot; Looking at theories of psychological personal identity Seth Schwartz, Curitis Dunkel and Alan Waterman found two types of &quot;personal identities&quot; susceptible to radicalization leading to terrorism:
# &quot;Foreclosed and authoritarian&quot; — Principally conservative Muslims who are often taught by their family and communities from early childhood to not deviate from a strict path and to either consider inferior or hate outside groups. When exposed to (alien) western culture, they are likely to judge it relative to their perception of the correct order of society, as well as perceive their own identities and mental health to be at risk.
# &quot;Diffuse and aimless&quot; — Principally converts whose lives are characterized by &quot;aimlessness, uncertainty and indecisiveness&quot; and who have neither explored different identities nor committed to a personal identity. Such people are &quot;willing to go to their deaths for ideas [such as jihadism] that they have appropriated from others&quot; and that give their lives purpose and certainty.

=== Characteristics of terrorists ===

In 2004, a forensic psychiatrist and former foreign service officer, Marc Sageman, made an &quot;intensive study of biographical data on 172 participants in the jihad&quot; in his book &quot;Understanding Terror Networks&quot;. He concluded social networks, the &quot;tight bonds of family and friendship&quot;, rather than emotional and behavioral disorders of &quot;poverty, trauma, madness, [or] ignorance&quot;, inspired alienated young Muslims to join the jihad and kill.

According to anthropologist Scott Atran, a NATO researcher studying suicide terrorism, as of 2005, the available evidence contradicts a number of simplistic explanations for the motivations of terrorists, including mental instability, poverty, and feelings of humiliation. The greatest predictors of suicide bombings—one common type of terror tactic used by Islamic terrorists—turns out to be not religion but group dynamics.
While personal humiliation does not turn out to be a motivation for those attempting to kill civilians, the perception that others with whom one feels a common bond are being humiliated can be a powerful driver for action. &quot;Small-group dynamics involving friends and family that form the diaspora cell of brotherhood and camaraderie on which the rising tide of martyrdom actions is based&quot;. Terrorists, according to Atran, are social beings influenced by social connections and values. Rather than dying &quot;for a cause&quot;, they might be said to have died &quot;for each other&quot;.

In a 2011 doctoral thesis, anthropologist Kyle R. Gibson reviewed three studies documenting 1,208 suicide attacks from 1981 to 2007 and found that countries with higher polygyny rates correlated with greater production of suicide terrorists. Political scientist Robert Pape has found that among Islamic suicide terrorists, 97 percent were unmarried and 84 percent were male (or if excluding the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party, 91 percent male), while a study conducted by the U.S. military in Iraq in 2008 found that suicide bombers were almost always single men without children aged 18 to 30 (with a mean age of 22), and were typically students or employed in blue-collar occupations. In addition to noting that countries where polygyny is widely practiced tend to have higher homicide rates and rates of rape, political scientists Valerie M. Hudson and Bradley Thayer have argued that because Islam is the only major religious tradition where polygyny is still largely condoned, the higher degrees of marital inequality in Islamic countries than most of the world causes them to have larger populations susceptible to suicide terrorism, and that promises of harems of virgins for martyrdom serves as a mechanism to mitigate in-group conflict within Islamic countries between alpha and non-alpha males by bringing esteem to the latter&#x27;s families and redirecting their violence towards out-groups.

Along with his research on the Tamil Tigers, Scott Atran found that Palestinian terrorist groups (such as Hamas) provide monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige to the families of suicide terrorists. Citing Atran and other anthropological research showing that 99 percent of Palestinian suicide terrorists are male, that 86 percent are unmarried, and that 81 percent have at least six siblings (larger than the average Palestinian family size), cognitive scientist Steven Pinker argues in &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot; (2011) that because the families of men in the West Bank and Gaza often cannot afford bride prices and that many potential brides end up in polygynous marriages, the financial compensation of an act of suicide terrorism can buy enough brides for a man&#x27;s brothers to have children to make the self-sacrifice pay off in terms of kin selection and biological fitness (with Pinker also citing a famous quotation attributed to evolutionary biologist J. B. S. Haldane when Haldane quipped that he would not sacrifice his life for his brother but would for &quot;two brothers or eight cousins&quot;).

In 2007, scholar Olivier Roy described the background of the hundreds of &quot;global&quot; (as opposed to local) terrorists who were incarcerated or killed and for whom authorities have records, as being surprising in a number of ways: The subjects frequently had a Westernized background; there were few Palestinians, Iraqis, or Afghans &quot;coming to avenge what is going on in their country&quot;; there was a lack of religiosity before radicalization through being &quot;born again&quot; in a foreign country; a high percentage of subjects had converted to Islam; their backgrounds were &quot;de-territorialized &quot;—meaning, for example, they were &quot;born in a country, then educated in another country, then go to fight in a third country and take refuge in a fourth country&quot;; and their beliefs about jihad differed from traditional ones—i.e. they believed jihad to be permanent, global, and &quot;not linked with a specific territory.&quot; Roy believes terrorism/radicalism is &quot;expressed in religious terms&quot; among the terrorists studied because

# most of the radicals have a Muslim background, which makes them open to a process of re-Islamisation (&quot;almost none of them having been pious before entering the process of radicalisation&quot;), and
# jihad is &quot;the only cause on the global market&quot;. If you kill in silence, it will be reported by the local newspaper; &quot;if you kill yelling &#x27;Allahu Akbar&#x27;, you are sure to make the national headlines&quot;. Other extreme causes—ultra-left or radical ecology are &quot;too bourgeois and intellectual&quot; for the radicals.

Author Lawrence Wright described the characteristic of &quot;displacement&quot; of members of the most famous Islamic terrorist group, al-Qaeda:

This profile of global Jihadists differs from that found among more recent local Islamist suicide bombers in Afghanistan. According to a 2007 study of 110 suicide bombers by Afghan pathologist Dr. Yusef Yadgari, 80% of the attackers studied had some kind of physical or mental disability. The bombers were also &quot;not celebrated like their counterparts in other Muslim nations. Afghan bombers are not featured on posters or in videos as martyrs.&quot; Daniel Byman, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution, and Christine Fair, an assistant professor in peace and security studies at Georgetown University, argue that many of the Islamic terrorists are foolish and untrained, perhaps even untrainable, with one in two Taliban suicide bombers killing only themselves.

Studying 300 cases of people charged with jihadist terrorism in the United States since 11 September 2001, author Peter Bergen found the perpetrators were &quot;generally motivated by a mix of factors&quot;, including &quot;militant Islamist ideology;&quot; opposition to &quot;American foreign policy in the Muslim world; a need to attach themselves to an ideology or organization that gave them a sense of purpose&quot;; and a &quot;cognitive opening&quot; to militant Islam that often was &quot;precipitated by personal disappointment, like the death of a parent&quot;.

However, two studies of the background of Muslim terrorists in Europe—one of the UK and one of France—found little connection between religious piety and terrorism among the terrorist rank and file. A &quot;restricted&quot; report of hundreds of case studies by the UK domestic counter-intelligence agency MI5 found that

A 2015 &quot;general portrait&quot; of &quot;the conditions and circumstances&quot; under which people living in France become &quot;Islamic radicals&quot; (terrorists or would-be terrorists) by Olivier Roy (see above) found radicalisation was not an &quot;uprising of a Muslim community that is victim to poverty and racism: only young people join, including converts&quot;.

== Refutations, criticisms and explanations for decline ==
=== Refuting Islamic terrorism ===

Along with explaining Islamic terrorism, many observers have attempted to point out their inconsistencies and the flaws in their arguments, often suggesting means of de-motivating potential terrorists.

Princeton University Middle Eastern scholar Bernard Lewis argues that although bin Laden and other radical Islamists claim they are fighting to restore shariah law to the Muslim world, their attacks on civilians violate the classical form of that Islamic jurisprudence. The &quot;classical jurists of Islam never remotely considered [jihad] the kind of unprovoked, unannounced mass slaughter of uninvolved civil populations&quot;. In regard to the September 11 attacks Lewis noted,

Similarly, Timothy Winter writes that the proclamations of bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri &quot;ignore 14 centuries of Muslim scholarship&quot;, and that if they &quot;followed the norms of their religion, they would have had to acknowledge that no school of mainstream Islam allows the targeting of civilians.&quot;

Researcher Donald Holbrook notes that while many jihadists quote the beginning of the famous sword verse (or ayah):
* But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. ...
... they fail to quote and discuss limiting factors that follow,
* &quot;... But if they repent and fulfill their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.&quot;
showing how they are (Holbrook argues) &quot;shamelessly selective in order to serve their propaganda objectives.&quot;

The scholarly credentials of the ideologues of extremism are also &quot;questionable&quot;. Dale C. Eikmeier notes

Michael Sells and Jane I. Smith (a professor of Islamic Studies) write that barring some extremists like al-Qaeda, most Muslims do not interpret Qur&#x27;anic verses as promoting warfare today but rather as reflecting historical contexts. According to Sells, most Muslims &quot;no more expect to apply&quot; the verses at issue &quot;to their contemporary non-Muslim friends and neighbors than most Christians and Jews consider themselves commanded by God, like the Biblical Joshua, to exterminate the infidels.&quot;

In his book &quot;No god but God: The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam&quot;, Iranian-American academic Reza Aslan argues that there is an internal battle currently taking place within Islam between individualistic reform ideals and the traditional authority of Muslim clerics. The struggle is similar to that of the 16th-century reformation in Christianity, and in fact is happening when the religion of Islam is as &quot;old&quot; as Christianity was at the time of its reformation. Aslan argues that &quot;the notion that historical context should play no role in the interpretation of the Koran—that what applied to Muhammad&#x27;s community applies to all Muslim communities for all time—is simply an untenable position in every sense.&quot;
Despite their proclaimed devotion to the virtue of Sharia law, Jihadists have not always avoided association with the pornography of the despised West. &quot;The Times&quot; (London) newspaper has pointed out that Jihadists were discovered by one source to have sought anonymity through some of the same dark networks used to distribute child pornography—quite ironic given their proclaimed piety. Similarly, Reuters news agency reported that pornography was found among the materials seized from Osama bin Laden&#x27;s Abbottabad compound that was raided by U.S. Navy SEALs.

;Takfir
Despite the fact that a founding principle of modern violent jihad is the defense of Islam and Muslims, most victims of attacks by Islamic terrorism (&quot;the vast majority&quot; according to one source—J.J. Goldberg) are self-proclaimed Muslims. Many if not all Salafi-Jihadi groups practice takfir—i.e. proclaim that some self-proclaimed Muslims (especially government officials and security personnel) are actually apostates deserving of death.

Furthermore, the more learned salafi-jihadi thinkers and leaders are (and were), the more reluctance they are/were to embrace takfir (according to a study by Shane Drennan). The late Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, &quot;the godfather of the Afghan jihad&quot;, for example, was an Islamic scholar and university professor who avoided takfir and preached unity in the ummah (Muslim community). The Islamic education of Al-Qaeda&#x27;s number two leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was early and much more informal—he was not a trained scholar—and al-Zawahiri expanded the definition of kafir to include many self-proclaimed Muslims. He has maintained that civilian government employees of Muslim states, security forces and any persons collaborating or engaging with these groups are apostates, for example.

Two extreme takfiris -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Sunni jihadist leader in Iraq, and Djamel Zitouni, leader of the Algerian Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA) during the Algerian civil war—had even broader definitions of apostasy and less religious knowledge. Al-Zarqawi was a petty criminal who had no religious training until he was 22 and limited training thereafter. Famous for bombing targets other jihadis thought off limits, his definition of apostates included all Shia Muslims and &quot;anyone violating his organization&#x27;s interpretation of Shari&#x27;a&quot;. Djamel Zitouni was the son of a chicken farmer with little Islamic education. He famously expanded the GIA&#x27;s definition of apostate until he concluded the whole of Algerian society outside of the GIA &quot;had left Islam&quot;. His attacks led to the deaths of thousands of Algerian civilians.

;De-radicalization
Evidence that more religious training may lead to less extremism has been found in Egypt. That country&#x27;s largest radical Islamic group, al-Jama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya — which killed at least 796 Egyptian policemen and soldiers from 1992 to 1998 — renounced bloodshed in 2003 in a deal with the Egyptian government where a series of high-ranking members were released (as of 2009 &quot;the group has perpetrated no new terrorist acts&quot;). A second group Egyptian Islamic Jihad made a similar agreement in 2007. Preceding the agreements was program where Muslim scholars debated with imprisoned group leaders arguing that true Islam did not support terrorism.

== Muslim attitudes toward terrorism ==
The opinions of Muslims on the subject of attacks on civilians by Islamist groups vary. Fred Halliday, a British academic specialist on the Middle East, argues that most Muslims consider these acts to be egregious violations of Islam&#x27;s laws. Muslims living in the West denounce the 11 September attacks against United States, while Hezbollah contends that their rocket attacks against Israeli targets are defensive jihad by a legitimate resistance movement rather than terrorism.

=== Views of modern Islamic scholars ===

In reference to suicide attacks, Hannah Stuart notes there is a &quot;significant debate among contemporary clerics over which circumstance permit such attacks.&quot; Qatar-based theologian, Yusuf al-Qaradawi, criticized the 9/11 attacks but previously justified suicide bombings in Israel on the grounds of necessity and justified such attacks in 2004 against American military and civilian personnel in Iraq. According to Stuart, 61 contemporary Islamic leaders have issued fatawa permitting suicide attacks, 32 with respect to Israel. Stuart points out that all of these contemporary rulings are contrary to classical Islamic jurisprudence.

Charles Kurzman and other authors have collected statements by prominent Muslim figures and organizations condemning terrorism.
In September 2014, an open letter to ISIS by &quot;over 120 prominent Muslim scholars&quot; denounced that group for &quot;numerous religious transgressions and abominable crimes&quot;.

Huston Smith, an author on comparative religion, argued that extremists have hijacked Islam, just as has occurred periodically in Christianity, Hinduism and other religions throughout history. He added that the real problem is that extremists do not know their own faith.

Ali Gomaa, former Grand Mufti of Egypt, stated not only for Islam but in general: &quot;Terrorism cannot be born of religion. Terrorism is the product of corrupt minds, hardened hearts, and arrogant egos, and corruption, destruction, and arrogance are unknown to the heart attached to the divine.&quot;

A 600-page legal opinion (&quot;fatwa&quot;) by Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri condemned suicide bombings and other forms of terrorism as &quot;kufr&quot; (unbelief), stating that it &quot;has no place in Islamic teaching and no justification can be provided for it, or any kind of excuses or ifs or buts.&quot; Iranian Ayatollah Ozma Seyyed Yousef Sanei has preached against suicide attacks and stated in an interview: &quot;Terror in Islam, and especially Shiite, is forbidden.&quot;

A group of Pakistani clerics of Jamaat Ahl-e-Sunnah (Barelvi movement) who were gathered for a convention denounced suicide attacks and beheadings as un-Islamic in a unanimous resolution. On 2 July 2013 in Lahore, 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings. It considers them to be forbidden.

== Tactics ==
=== Suicide attacks ===
Hezbollah was the first group to use suicide bombers in the Middle East. An increasingly popular tactic used by terrorists is suicide bombing. This tactic is used against civilians, soldiers, and government officials of the regimes the terrorists oppose. A recent clerical ruling declares terrorism and suicide bombing as forbidden by Islam.

=== Hijackings ===
Islamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the &quot;9/11&quot; attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of aircraft hijacking.

=== Hostage taking, kidnappings and executions ===

Along with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions (i.e. ritualized murders), often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted in the 1986 Iran–Contra affair. During the chaos of the Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.
;Motivations
Islamist militants, including Boko Haram, Hamas, al-Qaeda and the ISIS, have used kidnapping as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.

==== As political tactic ====
An example of political kidnapping occurred in September 2014, in the Philippines. The German Foreign Ministry reported that the Islamist militant group Abu Sayyaf had kidnapped two German nationals and was threatening to kill them unless the German government withdraw its support for the war against ISIS and also pay a large ransom. In September 2014 an Islamist militant group kidnapped a French national in Algeria and threatened to kill the hostage unless the government of France withdrew its support for the war against ISIS.

=====Islamist self-justifications =====

ISIL justified various acts internally, including beheadings and its kidnapping of Yazidi women and forcing them to become sex slaves or concubines.

Abubakar Shekau, the leader of the Nigerian extremist group Boko Haram, said in a 2014 interview claiming responsibility for the 2014 Chibok kidnapping of 270+ schoolgirls, &quot;Slavery is allowed in my religion, and I shall capture people and make them slaves&quot;.

==== Kidnapping as revenue ====
Nasir al-Wuhayshi leader of the Islamist militant group Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula describes kidnapped hostages as &quot;an easy spoil... which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure.&quot;

A 2014 investigation, by journalist Rukmini Maria Callimachi published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; demonstrated that between 2008 and 2014, Al Qaeda and groups directly affiliated with al-Qaeda took in over US$125 million from kidnapping, with $66 million of that total paid in 2013 alone. The article showed that from a somewhat haphazard beginning in 2003, kidnapping grew into the group&#x27;s main fundraising strategy, with targeted, professional kidnapping of civilians from wealthy European countries—principally France, Spain and Switzerland—willing to pay huge ransoms. US and UK nationals are less commonly targeted since these governments have shown an unwillingness to pay ransom.

Boko Haram kidnapped Europeans for the Ransom their governments would pay in the early 2010s.

According to Yochi Dreazen writing in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, although ISIS received funding from Qatar, Kuwait and other Gulf oil states, &quot;traditional criminal techniques like kidnapping&quot;, are a key funding source for ISIS. Armin Rosen writing in Business Insider, kidnapping was a &quot;crucial early source&quot; of funds as ISIS expanded rapidly in 2013. In March, upon receiving payment from the government of Spain, ISIS released 2 Spanish hostages working for the newspaper El Mundo, correspondent Javier Espinosa and photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova, who had been held since September 2013. Philip Balboni, CEO of GlobalPost told the press that he had spent &quot;millions&quot; in efforts to ransom journalist James Foley, and an American official told the Associated Press that demand from ISIS was for 100 million ($132.5). In September 2014, following the release of ISIS Beheading videos of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British Prime Minister David Cameron appealed to members of the G7 to abide by their pledges not to pay ransom &quot;in the case of terrorist kidnap&quot;.

Holding foreign journalists as hostages is so valuable to ISIS that Rami Jarrah, a Syrian who has acted as go-between in efforts to ransom foreign hostages, told the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that ISIS had &quot;made it known&quot; to other militant groups that they &quot;would pay&quot; for kidnapped journalists. ISIS has also kidnapped foreign-aid workers and Syrians who work for foreign-funded groups and reconstruction projects in Syria. By mid-2014, ISIS was holding assets valued at US$2 billion.

===== Kidnapping as psychological warfare =====
Boko Haram has been described as using kidnapping as a means of intimidating the civilian population into non-resistance.

According to psychologist Irwin Mansdorf, Hamas demonstrated effectiveness of kidnapping as a form of psychological warfare in the 2006 capture of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit when public pressure forced the government of Israel to release 1027 prisoners, including 280 convicted of terrorism by Israel, in exchange for his release. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Hamas has recognized the pull such incidents have over the Israeli psyche and clearly has moved to grab hostages in incidents such as the death and ransoming of Oron Shaul.&quot;

=== Internet recruiting ===

In the beginning of the 21st century, emerged a worldwide network of hundreds of web sites that inspire, train, educate and recruit young Muslims to engage in jihad against the United States and other Western countries, taking less prominent roles in mosques and community centers that are under scrutiny.
== Examples of organizations ==

=== Africa ===

The African continent has been affected by significant Islamist terrorist activity across the continent, involving various militant groups responsible for widespread violence and instability. In East Africa, Al-Shabaab has been a central figure in conflicts, particularly in Somalia and Kenya. North and West Africa have seen major incidents tied to groups like Boko Haram, which has caused severe disruptions in Nigeria and neighboring countries. Additionally, nations such as Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco have experienced deadly attacks linked to broader extremist networks. These activities have led to extensive casualties and displacement across the region. Civilians have been the main targets of terrorist attacks by Islamist militants.

=== Asia ===

In Afghanistan, since 2006, Taliban and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin forces have escalated attacks against civilians. Kyrgyz-American brothers were behind the Boston Marathon bombing. In Tajikistan, the IMU was blamed for a 2010 suicide bombing that killed two policemen. Uzbekistan saw multiple attacks, including the 1999 Tashkent bombings targeting President Karimov. China has faced attacks linked to Xinjiang separatism. In Bangladesh, Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen and Ansarullah Bangla have been involved in bombings and attacks on activists. In India, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are responsible for numerous attacks, while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have also faced Islamist attacks. The Abu Sayyaf Group in the Philippines continues a long-running insurgency.

=== Europe ===

The Europe has seen significant Islamist terrorist attacks, including the 2004 Madrid bombings, the 2005 London bombings, and the 2015 Paris attacks, all of which caused numerous casualties. A report highlights that jihadist terrorism has been responsible for the majority of deaths from terrorism in Europe from 2001 to 2014. It also discusses how jihadists in Europe have financed their activities through petty crime and how terrorist attacks have increasingly targeted people rather than property. Countries like Belgium, Netherlands, France, and Germany have faced multiple attacks, with Belgium being a significant base for planning attacks like the 2015 Paris attacks. Despite proximity to conflict zones, Italy has had relatively fewer jihadist incidents. The EU report found that most Islamist terror suspects were second or third-generation immigrants, while over 99% of attempted terrorist attacks in Europe in the past three years were committed by non-Muslims.

In Norway, two men were sentenced in 2012 under anti-terror legislation for plotting against cartoonist Kurt Westergaard. Russia has faced politically and religiously motivated attacks, particularly in Chechnya, including the 2002 Moscow theater and 2004 Beslan school hostage crises, linked to groups like the Caucasus Emirate. Spain has seen jihadist activity since the 1990s, highlighted by the 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2017 Barcelona attacks. In Sweden, terrorist incidents have occurred like the 2010 Stockholm bombings and the 2017 Stockholm truck attack.

=== Middle East ===

Militant Islamism in Turkey primarily has Kurdish roots, with groups like Turkish Hizbullah and İBDA-C opposing Turkish secularism. Iraq has experienced terrorist activity, especially during the US-led Iraq War. In Palestine and Israeli territories, groups such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement have launched numerous attacks against Israel. Additionally, Fatah al-Islam operates in Lebanon with goals of establishing Islamic law in Palestinian refugee camps.

=== Americas ===

In Canada, the government identifies terrorism as a significant threat, particularly emphasizing domestic radicalization, as seen in the 2006 Ontario terrorism plot involving an Al-Qaeda-inspired cell. In the United States, the 9/11 attacks resulted in nearly 3,000 fatalities and initiated the War on Terror, with homegrown extremism highlighted as a major concern. Australia and New Zealand have also experienced notable attacks, such as the Lindt Café siege and the Auckland supermarket stabbing. In Argentina, the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy and the 1994 AMIA bombing were linked to terrorist groups and Iran, resulting in significant casualties and political repercussions.

=== Transnational ===
Al-Qaeda&#x27;s stated aim is the use of jihad to defend and protect Islam against Zionism, Christianity, the secular West, and Muslim governments such as Saudi Arabia, which it sees as insufficiently Islamic and too closely tied to the United States.

<text>The Grant Government Medical College is a public medical college located in Mumbai, India. It is affiliated to the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences. Founded in 1845, it is one of the oldest medical colleges in South Asia. Its clinical affiliate is Sir J.J. Group of Hospitals, a conglomerate of four hospitals in South Mumbai including Sir J.J. Hospital, St George Hospital, Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital and Cama and Albless Hospital.

== History ==
=== Establishment of Grant Medical College ===

 The Bombay Presidency became part of the British possessions in India in 1818. In Western India there was a need for well-trained doctors as well as a general hospital for Indians. Under the guidance of Mountstuart Elphinstone attempts were made to offer Indians an opportunity to learn and practice Medicine along western lines. In 1826, a medical school was started with surgeon John McLennan as the superintendent of the Indian (native) medical school around Azad Maidan in southern Bombay. However, this school failed after six years. Around 1840 only two medical schools existed in India, one at Calcutta and another at Madras.

In 1834 Sir Robert Grant was appointed the Governor of Bombay. He directed his attention to the expediency of establishing a systematic institution in the city for imparting medical knowledge to the, which would be more complete, comprehensive and better planned than the previously abolished medical school. He instituted a detailed inquiry into the ways and means by which Indians could have better medical care and education. As he struggled and strove to push through his ambition for a wisely planned medical college in Bombay, he met strong opposition. To quell the opposition Grant envisaged the formation of the first medical society in India, The Medical and Physical Society of Bombay. It was a society that would bring together the medical officers of the Bombay Presidency and encourage a spirit of scientific enquiry. It was due to efforts of Charles Morehead (the then surgeon) to the governor that this society came into existence in November 1835. 

Moorehead and other members studied all the documents pertaining to the abolished medical school. They also drew up and circulated a questionnaire aimed at collecting information on the current medical practices among the Indians. It was also intended to help educate Indians in European medicine. In July 1837, the Society reported that &quot;the conclusion to which we have been led by this course of inquiry is that the establishment of a medical school for the education of the Indians of the presidency in medical science is necessary, to the extent of qualifying Indians to become useful and safe practitioners of medicine.&quot;

Grant developed a proposal in March 1838 in which the subject of medical education for the Indians of this presidency was fully discussed in detail. It was sent to Sir Auckland&#x27;s government in Calcutta. In March 1838 Sir, Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy offered a donation of Rs. 1 lakh for building a new general hospital for Indians. Grant took note of this in his minute, adding that the hospital would facilitate medical instruction. The East India Company, as conveyed in its letter dated 18 July 1838, happily endorsed the proposal for a medical college. However, nine days before the arrival of this news, Grant succumbed to an attack of cerebral apoplexy while vacationing in Dapori, near Pune.

A historic public meeting was held in the town hall by the citizens of Bombay to mourn his death. The Sanskrit scholar Jagannath Shankarsheth proposed that it would be a fitting tribute that the medical college should be established and that it should bear his name. The government accepted this proposal. The foundation stone of the building was laid on 30 March 1843, and the building was completed in October 1845.

Simultaneously with the plans and foundation of the college, it was also decided, with the aid of a munificent donation offered by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy, to replace the previously existing Indian general hospital in the city, by creating a &quot;School of Practice&quot; (now known as the Sir J.J. Hospital) near the hospital and in conjunction with it. The professors of the medical college also served as the medical officers of the hospital. The foundation stone was laid on 3 January 1843 and the School of Practice was opened for reception of the sick from 15 May 1845. In 1845, admittance to the college was accorded without exception for caste or creed to candidates between the ages of 16 and 20 with respectable connection and general intelligence; grammatical knowledge of their vernacular language, arithmetic including Rules of Proportion and a thorough knowledge of English with fluency was expected. Each candidate was required to present a certificate of good conduct from the headmaster of the school in which he had studied and also one expressly stating that he was possessed of the necessary information and capable of undergoing the examination proposed.

The entrance examination was conducted by the superintendent and the professors of the college. The books selected for testing the knowledge of English were Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Robertson&#x27;s Histories&quot;, or a similar classical standard.

The first group of students admitted to the Grant Medical College, Bombay, on 1 November 1845 were: 

* Free: Bhau Daji Parsekar, Monoel A.D. Carvalho, Sebestian A.D. Carvalho
* Stipendary: Atmaram Pandurang, Paul Francis Gomes, Fardemjee Jamshetji, Ananta Chandroba Dkule, Manoel Antonio D&#x27;Abrew, J.C. Lisoba who became the professor of Anatomy and Surgery, the President of the Grant Medical College Society for 10 years and of the Bombay Medical Association for 4 years.

The first professors of Grant Medical College were Charles Morehead, M.D., FRCS, Professor of the Institute of Practice of Medicine, Dr. John Peet, M.D., FRCS, Professor of Anatomy and Surgery and Dr. Herbert John Giraud, M.D., Professor of Chemistry and Materia Medica.
In 1849 two more teachers joined the college. Dr. W. C. Colls taught Medical Jurisprudence and Dr. R. D. Peele taught Midwifery.

Attendance was not quite satisfactory during the first year. In following years, however, it became so good that students declined to take advantage of holidays but preferred to attend classes.

The Bombay University was founded in 1857. In 1860, Grant Medical College became one of the four colleges recognized by it for teaching courses leading to degrees (others being Elphinstone College, Deccan College and Government Law College, Mumbai). With its affiliation to the university, GMC&#x27;s entrance exams were abolished. Matriculation in Bombay University was made a necessary qualification for admission to the Medical College. The G.G.M.C. degree was replaced by L.M. (Licentiate of Medicine) which later gave way to L.M.&amp;S. (Licentiate of Medicine and Surgery) and finally to M.B.B.S.

=== Gradual expansion of Sir J.J. Hospital ===

Immediately after the First World War, there was a great rush of students to the college. To continue to provide effective instruction training at the bedside of patients, the Gokuldas Tejpal Hospital was used as a teaching center in the subjects of Medicine and Surgery in 1924. This arrangement has continued to date.

Gradually the facilities at the Sir J.J. Group of Hospitals were also increased. The Sir Leslie Wilson Hospital Fund played an important part. The Yellappa Balaram pavilion (104 beds), Sir David Sassoon Hospital (97 beds and O.T.), Byramjee Jejeebhoy Hospital for Children (100 beds) were constructed and the Sir C.J. Ophthalmic Hospital was reconstructed (adding 73 beds).

The students had to stay in chawls opposite the compound until 1911 when the old hostel was built. In 1938, the R.M. Bhatt hostel was built thanks to the efforts of C.S. Patel and Col. Bhatia — one of the most respected teacher of his time.

The Pathology Department was established in 1880; the first autopsy was conducted in 1882. In 1896, Sir V.M. Haffkine/Waldemar Haffkine worked on the preparation of plague vaccine in the F.D. Petit Laboratory of G.M.C. (which is today occupied by Pharmacology Department).

Robert Koch&#x27;s work on Vibrio cholerae was done in two rooms of the old animal house behind coroner&#x27;s court. Henry Vandyke Carter, after whom the O.P.D. Laboratory of Sir J.J.H. is named discovered in the pathology department the spirochaetes of relapsing fever in blood smears in 1907. It was here that Christopher and Caval worked on malaria and Dr. Raghavendra Rao worked in on tropical diseases, leprosy, plague and leishmaniasis.

In 1929, the department was shifted to the new building of Pathology School thanks to the munificence of the Tatas. Dr. V.R. Khanolkar the doyen of Pathology in India initiated work on cancer epidemiology. He was the founder member and the first president of the Indian Association of Pathologists in 1949. Dr. P.V. Gharpure started the Pathology Museum and the Association of Teaching Pathologists in Bombay.

The first M.D. of Bombay University was Dr. Anna Moreshwar Kunte in 1876. Another GMCite Dr. K.N. Bahadurji was the first Indian to obtain M.D. from London (MB &amp; BS 1886, MD 1887). He died of plague in 1896 while in charge of the Passes Plague Hospital. In his memory the Student Sick Ward was built. This was torn down and replaced in 1908 to make room for the William Moore Operation Theatre.

Initially in 1845, J.J. Hospital had only a casualty and an Out Patient Department with a dispensary behind it. Soon in 1851, the Obstetric institution was built thanks to Sir J.J.&#x27;s donations. In 1892, the Obstetric ward became the Parsee ward.

In 1866, the Ophthalmic Hospital was erected by the donation given by Sir Cowasjee Jehangirjee. In 1930 it was remodeled by Sir J. Duggan in a three-storeyed building remodeled it for which Sir Cowasjee Jehangir, Third Baronet, donated a large sum. This was later reformed as the O.P.D. In this small place also existed the Medical Department, Minor Surgery, E.N.T. Department, and Dental chair. From 1907 to 1928 this was converted into biology and bacteriology laboratories.

The General Medical Council found that the facilities for teaching midwifery were deficient in G.M.C. To overcome this problem, the Bai Motlibai and Cama Albless Hospital were affiliated to G.M.C. by 1923.

=== Non-cooperation movement ===
During the early 1900s all prestigious professional posts were held by British I.M.S. officers, while Indians were given only non-clinical appointments. In 1921, the Non-cooperation movement appealed to GMCites to boycott the British government by leaving G.M.C. Students, professors and practitioners began shifting to Topiwala National Medical College near Victoria Gardens. Masses were held between 6-8 p.m. for medical students by famous medical practitioners, all GMCites. To prove that Indians themselves could build and maintain medical institutions without British support, the K.E.M. Hospital and Seth G.S. Medical College where the entire staff was Indian were founded in 1926.

=== Post-independence reconstructions ===
The greatest change to G.M.C. and J.J.H. came in 1958 when the old J.J. building was torn down and replaced by a seven-storeyed hospital building. The O.P.D. was extended to contain Investigation Laboratories. Today it is spread over in Byculla with 14 gates, a long jump from the two-room teaching hospital in an area of .

== The J. J. Hospital Campus ==
The medical college is situated in Byculla on the campus of Sir J. J. Hospital. The hospital has 2844 beds and caters to an annual load of 1,200,000 out-patients and 80,000 in-patients, from all parts of Maharashtra and central India. The campus is the largest of any medical colleges in Mumbai. It is spread out over in the Byculla area of South Mumbai. The campus is notable for its greenery and open spaces in an otherwise congested part of the city. With gradual additions and expansions since its initial foundation, the campus has a mix of buildings depicting both modern Indian and Colonial architecture. As the campus expanded it incorporated hospitals that were originally independent before being absorbed into J.J. Hospital and thus retain some of their older names, notably: C.J. Ophthalmic Hospital, B.J. Hospital for children and the David Sasoon Hospital. The campus has a total of 45 wards, 5 hostels and 7 canteens. It also provides residential facilities to its teaching faculty, resident doctors, medical students, nurses and other hospital workers. The anatomy hall of Grant Medical College was featured in the movie Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. as central lecture hall in the fictional medical school attended by the lead character. In addition to the main campus situated at Byculla, it also has a sea facing gymkhana at marine drive in south Mumbai. Recently
The JJ hospital campus also includes the Richardson Cruddas building next to it for research purposes .

== The Research Society ==
The Research Society started functioning in 1965 in the Skin &amp; Serology Department building on the second floor with an office and research library and a proposed space for a research laboratory. However, the laboratory proposal has not been entertained so far. It has the following aims and objectives:
* To promote and encourage research and medical science in departments of GMC &amp; J.J.H.
* Sponsor all such activities conducted to promotion of medical science &amp; all such measures to fulfill objectives.

The founder members were Dr. J. G. Parekh, Dr. S. J. Shah, Dr. V. C. Talwalkar, Dr. J.C. Joshipura and Dr. B. B. Gaitonde.

It awards post graduate students for the best research paper and for the best thesis. It sponsors scientific conferences, medical workshops and symposia.

<text>Kallithea (Greek: Καλλιθέα, meaning &quot;beautiful view&quot;) is a suburb in Athens agglomeration and a municipality in south Athens regional unit. It is the eighth largest municipality in Greece (97,616 inhabitants, 2021 census), as well as the fourth biggest in the Athens urban area (following municipalities of Athens, Piraeus and Peristeri). Additionally, it is the 2nd most densely populated municipality in Greece and one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with . The municipality has an area of .

==Location==
The center of Kallithea (Davaki Square) lies at a distance of to the south of the Athens city center (Syntagma Square) and to the north-east of the Piraeus (photo 1). Kallithea extends from the Filopappou and Sikelia hills in the north to Phaleron Bay in the south; its two other sides consist of Syngrou Avenue to the east (border to the towns of Nea Smyrni and Palaio Faliro), and the Ilisos River to the west (border to the towns of Tavros and Moschato) (photo 2).

The site on which the city was developed covers the biggest part of the area to the south of Athens city center, protected in ancient times (5th century BC) by the Long Walls to the west and the Phalerum Wall to the east (photo 3). Somewhere within this area the ancient town of Xypete lay. The town and its citizens are mentioned, among other places, in Plato&#x27;s Dialogs.

==1896 and 2004 Athens Olympics==
The plans for the establishment of the new city of Kallithea were officially approved in December 1884. On the longitudinal axis of the town (Thiseos Avenue), the Athens to Phaleron tramway once ran, from the beginning (1850) to (1955) and the end of its operations. Near the center of the town the Shooting Range (Skopeftirion) was built to house events of the first modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics, and these first modern games took place in three venues: the refurbished ancient stadium of Athens (Panathinaiko Stadium) NE of Kallithea, the Neo Phaliron Velodrome (currently Karaiskaki Stadium) SW of Kallithea, and the Kallithea Shooting Range (Skopeftirion).

Events of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games were also sited in the district of Kallithea, notably handball and Taekwondo in the new Sports Pavilion (Faliro) by the bottom of Syngrou Avenue, and beach volleyball in the Olympic Beach Volleyball Center on Kallithea Bay (Tzitzifies).

==Growth==
Between the first modern games (1896) and the 2004 Olympic Games in the city, Kallithea grew significantly. Initially the tramway depot and workshop were built here in 1910, followed by the Harokopios Graduate School (1925) and the Panteios Graduate School of Political Sciences (1928).

In the 1920s the town was flooded by thousands of refugees following the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), the Asia Minor Catastrophe (1922), and the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). These refugees arrived in Kallithea mainly from the south Black Sea (Pontus), from ancient Greek cities such as Sinope (now Sinop, Turkey), Sampsus (now Samsun, Turkey), Kerasus (now Giresun, Turkey), Trapezous-Trebizond (now Trabzon, Turkey), Tripolis (now Tirebolu, Turkey), Argyroupolis (now Gümüshane, Turkey) and other remnants of the late Byzantine Empire.

A few had arrived earlier (1919) from the north and east (Russian) coasts of the Black Sea, from places such as Odessos (Odesa), Marioupolis (Mariupol, the Sea of Azov) and elsewhere, after the failed attempt of the western allies (Greece included) against the young Bolshevik state during the Russian Civil War.

Black Sea immigrants of Greek origin also settled in Kallithea in the 1930s, as a result of the change of Soviet policy toward ethnic groups. Their origins were mainly in the east coast of the Black Sea (Batumi, Sukhumi, Novorossiysk, Anapa etc.)

The first refugees settled originally near the site of the first Olympic shooting range (1896), until they were gradually transferred to new dwellings. After its evacuation the building bound with the shooting range served as a school, until the Nazi Occupation of 1941, when it was converted to a prison. The prison of Kallithea was demolished in 1966; among others, fighters of the Greek Resistance and victims of the Greek Civil War had been jailed there, such as Nikos Beloyannis.

In the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a new wave of Greek immigrants arrived in Kallithea from the east coast of the Black Sea, from the Caucasus highlands in Georgia, as well as from distant Greek settlements in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan where their Black Sea Greek ancestors were expelled during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime in the 1930s.

===Historical population===
==Climate==
Kallithea has a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) bordering a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification). It has very hot dry summers and mild winters. During the summer of 2024 the National Observatory of Athens station in Harokopio University reached a stunning summer mean maximum temperature of . 

==Culture==
Kallithea&#x27;s main cultural center is the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center. South Kallithea (Tzitzifies), is associated with the development of Greek folk music, particularly rebetiko and later laïkó. Popular composers and singers once performed here; Markos Vamvakaris, Vassilis Tsitsanis, Yannis Papaioannou, Marika Ninou, Sotiria Bellou, Manolis Chiotis, Mary Linda, Giorgos Zampetas, Stelios Kazantzidis, Marinella, Poly Panou, and Viki Moscholiou.

===Education===
Kallithea houses two universities (Harokopio University and Panteion University). An even more notable school in Kallithea is Sivitanidios School, one of the oldest technical school in Greece.

===Sports===
Until 2004, south Kallithea (Tzitzifies) housed the only horse track in Greece (Ippodromos - Hippodrome), which later moved to Markopoulon, near Eleftherios Venizelos Airport. Kallithea houses numerous cultural associations and several sport clubs, the most well known of which are Athens Kallithea F.C. (soccer), Esperos (basketball, volleyball, handball, and also soccer in an earlier period) and Ikaros Kallitheas, a multisport club founded in 1991, originally as Ikaros Nea Smyrni. Kallithea had another important club, Esperides Kallithea with many titles in women basketball. This club merged to Ikaros Kallithea in 2012.
==Transportation==
The main roads of Kallithea are Andrea Syngrou Avenue towards eastern Athens and Poseidonos Avenue towards Piraeus and the other southern suburbs. Kallithea is served by metro line 1 stations Kallithea and Tavros, by the tram stations Kallithea and Tzitzifies, and numerous bus and trolley-bus linesconnect Kallithea to almost every destination in metropolitan Athens.

<text>Cresaptown is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in Allegany County, Maryland, United States. As of the 2010 census it had a population of 6,247. Prior to 2010 it was part of the Cresaptown-Bel Air CDP. Cresaptown&#x27;s post office was established December 22, 1800. Cresaptown is located southwest of Cumberland.

==History==
Prior to 1728, Cresaptown was the site of a Shawnee village along the Potomac River. The inhabitants of this region were a portion of the Shawanese tribe, a sub-division of the Algonquian group, one of the most warlike combinations of that period. The warriors engaged in hunting and fishing for food and furs, while their families were left at home to tend the maize and grass that grew in the rich soil of the Potomac valley. The maize was ground into corn meal and made into Shawnee cake, a popular diet of the Shawnees living in the valley.

The Shawanees in the valley lived in shelters composed of two forked posts that were driven into the ground, and on these was laid a ridge pole. Small saplings, cut to a length of about , were laid against the pole, one end resting on the ground, forming a shelter similar to a V-shaped tent. This was covered with bark and skins and made tight enough to protect against rain or snow. The floors were spread with furs, which made sure for seats or beds.
Emanuel Custer, father of George Armstrong Custer, was born in Cresaptown 1806, and moved to Ohio in 1845, finally settling in Michigan.

Cresaptown was named for the family of Daniel Cresap, early settler and son of Thomas Cresap.

<text>A was a high ranking samurai in the direct service of the Tokugawa shogunate of feudal Japan. While all three of the shogunates in Japanese history had official retainers, in the two preceding ones, they were referred to as . However, in the Edo period, were the upper vassals of the Tokugawa house, and the were the lower vassals. There was no precise difference between the two in terms of income level, but a had the right to an audience with the , whereas did not. The word literally means &quot;origin/base of the flag&quot;, with the sense of &#x27;around the flag&#x27;, it is described in Japanese as &#x27;those who guard the flag&#x27; (on the battlefield) and is often translated into English as &quot;bannerman&quot;. Another term for the Edo-era was , sometimes rendered as &quot;direct shogunal &quot;, which serves to illustrate the difference between them and the preceding generation of who served various lords.

==History==
The term originated in the Sengoku period. The term was used for the direct retainers of a lord; as the name suggests, the men who were grouped &quot;around of the flag&quot;. Many lords had ; however, when the Tokugawa clan achieved ascendancy in 1600, its system was institutionalized, and it is that system which is chiefly referred to now when using the term.

In the eyes of the Tokugawa shogunate, were retainers who had served the family from its days in Mikawa onward. However, the ranks of the also included people from outside the hereditary ranks of the Tokugawa house. Retainer families of defeated formerly grand families like the Takeda, Hōjō, or Imagawa were included, as were cadet branches of lord families. Also included were heirs to lords whose domains were confiscated, for example Asano Daigaku, the brother of Asano Naganori, local power figures in remote parts of the country who never became ; and the families of Kamakura and Muromachi periods (Governors): some of these include the Akamatsu, Besshō (branch of the Akamatsu), Hōjō, Hatakeyama, Kanamori (branch of the Toki), Imagawa, Mogami (branch of the Ashikaga), Nagai, Oda, Ōtomo, Takeda, Toki, Takenaka (branch of the Toki), Takigawa, Tsutsui, and Yamana families. The act of becoming a was known as .

Many fought in the Boshin War of 1868, on both sides of the conflict.

The remained retainers of the main Tokugawa clan after the fall of the shogunate in 1868, and followed the Tokugawa to their new domain of Shizuoka. The lost their status along with all other samurai in Japan following the abolition of the domains in 1871.

==Ranks and roles==
The division between and , especially amongst of lower rank, was not rigid, and the title of had more to do with rank rather than income rating. In the context of an army, it could be compared to the position of an officer. Throughout the Edo period, held the distinction that if they possessed high enough rank, they had the right to personal audience with the (these were known as ). All can be divided into two categories, the , who took their incomes straight from Tokugawa granaries, and the , who held land scattered throughout Japan. Another level of status distinction amongst the was the class of , men who were heads of families and held provincial fiefs, and had alternate attendance () duties like the . However, as were men of very high income in terms of the spectrum of stipends, not all had the duty of alternate attendance. The dividing line between the upper and the &#x27;—the domain lords who were also vassals of the Tokugawa house—was 10,000 .

At the beginning of the 18th century, about 5,000 samurai held the rank of ; over two thirds of these had an income of less than 400 koku and only about 100 earned 5,000 koku or more. A with 500 koku had seven permanent non-samurai servants, two swordsmen, a lancer, and an archer on standby.

Infrequently, some were granted an increase in income and thus promoted to the rank of . One example of such a promotion is the case of the Hayashi family of Kaibuchi (later known as Jōzai han), who began as but who became and went on to play a prominent role in the Boshin War, despite their domain&#x27;s relatively small size of 10,000 .

The term for a with income of about 8,000 or greater was (&quot;greater &quot;).

The who lived in Edo resided in their own private districts and oversaw their own police work and security. Men from ranks could serve in a variety of roles in the Tokugawa administration, including service in the police force as inspectors, city magistrates, magistrates or tax collectors of direct Tokugawa house land, members of the council, and many other positions.

The expression was in popular use to denote their numbers, but a 1722 study put their numbers at about 5,000. Adding the brought the number up to about 17,000.

Two who were directly involved in the development of the martial arts were Yagyū Munenori and Yamaoka Tesshū. Munenori&#x27;s family became hereditary sword instructors to the .

<text>Crashlander is a fix-up novel by American writer Larry Niven, published in 1994 () and set in his &quot;Known Space&quot; universe. It is also a term used in the Known Space universe, denoting a human born on the planet &quot;We Made It&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Crashlander&quot; brings together the short stories featuring the space pilot Beowulf Shaeffer — &quot;Neutron Star&quot; (1966), &quot;At the Core&quot; (1966), &quot;Flatlander&quot; (1967), &quot;Grendel&quot; (1968), &quot;The Borderland of Sol&quot; (1975), and &quot;Procrustes&quot; (1993).

The stories are linked, and some of them extended, by a framing story, &quot;Ghost&quot;. This story recounts Shaeffer&#x27;s reunion with a ghostwriter whom Shaeffer had used to write about his adventures at the neutron star and at the core, Ander Smittarasheed. Ander, working for ARM agent Sigmund Ausfaller, has come to question him about his dealings with Pierson&#x27;s Puppeteers, General Products and Carlos Wu, as well as what happened to Wu and ARM agent Feather Filip. Wu, Shaeffer and Sharrol Janss and their children, Tanya and Louis Wu, had secretly emigrated from Earth to the planet Fafnir to escape the control of Earth&#x27;s United Nations government and the ARM.

&quot;Neutron Star&quot;, &quot;At The Core&quot;, &quot;Flatlander&quot;&#x27;, and &quot;Grendel&quot; were previously included in the 1968 collection &quot;Neutron Star&quot;.

Most of the stories in the collection are retold from the point of view of Sigmund Ausfaller in &quot;Juggler of Worlds&quot;.

==Crashlander (in-universe term)==
A &quot;Crashlander&quot;, in Known Space, is anyone from the planet &quot;We Made It&quot;. As the names imply, the colonists who first settled the planet almost did not survive the landing.

<doc id="566869" wikidata="Q583095" url="?curid=566869" title="Quasi-arithmetic mean">
<text>In mathematics and statistics, the quasi-arithmetic mean or generalised &quot;f&quot;-mean or Kolmogorov-Nagumo-de Finetti mean is one generalisation of the more familiar means such as the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, using a function formula_1. It is also called Kolmogorov mean after Soviet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov. It is a broader generalization than the regular generalized mean.

==Definition==

If &quot;f&quot; is a function which maps an interval formula_2 of the real line to the real numbers, and is both continuous and injective, the &quot;f&quot;-mean of formula_3 numbers
formula_4
is defined as formula_5, which can also be written 
:formula_6

We require &quot;f&quot; to be injective in order for the inverse function formula_7 to exist. Since formula_1 is defined over an interval, formula_9 lies within the domain of formula_7.

Since &quot;f&quot; is injective and continuous, it follows that &quot;f&quot; is a strictly monotonic function, and therefore that the &quot;f&quot;-mean is neither larger than the largest number of the tuple formula_11 nor smaller than the smallest number in formula_11.

== Examples ==

* If formula_13, the real line, and formula_14, (or indeed any linear function formula_15, formula_16 not equal to 0) then the &quot;f&quot;-mean corresponds to the arithmetic mean.
* If formula_17, the positive real numbers and formula_18, then the &quot;f&quot;-mean corresponds to the geometric mean. According to the &quot;f&quot;-mean properties, the result does not depend on the base of the logarithm as long as it is positive and not 1.
* If formula_17 and formula_20, then the &quot;f&quot;-mean corresponds to the harmonic mean.
* If formula_17 and formula_22, then the &quot;f&quot;-mean corresponds to the power mean with exponent formula_23.
* If formula_13 and formula_25, then the &quot;f&quot;-mean is the mean in the log semiring, which is a constant shifted version of the LogSumExp (LSE) function (which is the logarithmic sum), formula_26. The formula_27 corresponds to dividing by , since logarithmic division is linear subtraction. The LogSumExp function is a smooth maximum: a smooth approximation to the maximum function.

== Properties ==
The following properties hold for formula_28 for any single function formula_1:

Symmetry: The value of formula_28 is unchanged if its arguments are permuted.

Idempotency: for all &quot;x&quot;, formula_31.

Monotonicity: formula_28 is monotonic in each of its arguments (since formula_1 is monotonic).

Continuity: formula_28 is continuous in each of its arguments (since formula_1 is continuous).

Replacement: Subsets of elements can be averaged a priori, without altering the mean, given that the multiplicity of elements is maintained. With formula_36 it holds:

:formula_37

Partitioning: The computation of the mean can be split into computations of equal sized sub-blocks:formula_38

Self-distributivity: For any quasi-arithmetic mean formula_39 of two variables: formula_40.

Mediality: For any quasi-arithmetic mean formula_39 of two variables:formula_42.

Balancing: For any quasi-arithmetic mean formula_39 of two variables:formula_44.

Central limit theorem : Under regularity conditions, for a sufficiently large sample, formula_45 is approximately normal.
A similar result is available for Bajraktarević means and deviation means, which are generalizations of quasi-arithmetic means.

Scale-invariance: The quasi-arithmetic mean is invariant with respect to offsets and scaling of formula_1: formula_47.

== Characterization ==
There are several different sets of properties that characterize the quasi-arithmetic mean (i.e., each function that satisfies these properties is an &quot;f&quot;-mean for some function &quot;f&quot;).

* Mediality is essentially sufficient to characterize quasi-arithmetic means.
* Self-distributivity is essentially sufficient to characterize quasi-arithmetic means.
* Replacement: Kolmogorov proved that the five properties of symmetry, fixed-point, monotonicity, continuity, and replacement fully characterize the quasi-arithmetic means.
* Continuity is superfluous in the characterization of two variables quasi-arithmetic means. See [10] for the details.
* Balancing: An interesting problem is whether this condition (together with symmetry, fixed-point, monotonicity and continuity properties) implies that the mean is quasi-arithmetic. Georg Aumann showed in the 1930s that the answer is no in general, but that if one additionally assumes formula_39 to be an analytic function then the answer is positive.

== Homogeneity ==

Means are usually homogeneous, but for most functions formula_1, the &quot;f&quot;-mean is not.
Indeed, the only homogeneous quasi-arithmetic means are the power means (including the geometric mean); see Hardy–Littlewood–Pólya, page 68.

The homogeneity property can be achieved by normalizing the input values by some (homogeneous) mean formula_50.
:formula_51
However this modification may violate monotonicity and the partitioning property of the mean.

== Generalizations ==

Consider a Legendre-type strictly convex function formula_52. Then the gradient map formula_53 is globally invertible and the weighted multivariate quasi-arithmetic mean is defined by
formula_54, where formula_55 is a normalized weight vector (formula_56 by default for a balanced average). From the convex duality, we get a dual quasi-arithmetic mean formula_57 associated to the quasi-arithmetic mean formula_58.
For example, take formula_59 for formula_60 a symmetric positive-definite matrix.
The pair of matrix quasi-arithmetic means yields the matrix harmonic mean:
formula_61

<text>Lydia Cabrera (May 20, 1899, in Havana, Cuba – September 19, 1991, in Miami, Florida) was a Cuban independent ethnographer, writer, and literary activist. She was an authority on Santería and other Afro-Cuban religions. During her lifetime she published over one hundred books; little of her work is available in English. Her most important book is &quot;El Monte&quot; (Spanish: &quot;The Wilderness&quot;), which was the first major ethnographic study of Afro-Cuban traditions, herbalism and religion. First published in 1954, the book became a &quot;textbook&quot; for those who practice Lukumi (orisha religion originating from the Yoruba and neighboring ethnic groups) and Palo Monte (a central African faith) both religions reaching the Caribbean through enslaved Africans. Her papers and research materials were donated to the Cuban Heritage Collection - the largest repository of materials on or about Cuba located outside of Cuba - forming part of the library of the University of Miami. A section in Guillermo Cabrera Infante&#x27;s book &quot;Tres Tigres Tristes&quot; is written under Lydia Cabrera&#x27;s name, in a comical rendition of her literary voice. She was one of the first writers to recognize and sensitively publish on the richness of Afro-Cuban culture and religion. She made valuable contributions in the areas of literature, anthropology, art, ethnomusicology, and ethnology.

In El Monte, Cabrera fully described the major Afro-Cuban religions: Regla de Ocha (commonly known as Santeria) and Ifá, which are both derived from traditional Yoruba religion; and Palo Monte, which originated in Central Africa.
Both the literary and anthropological perspectives in Cabrera&#x27;s work assume that she wrote about mainly oral, practical religions with only an “embryonic” written tradition. She is credited by literary critics for having transformed Afro-Cuban oral narratives into literature, which is, written works of art, while anthropologists rely on her accounts of oral information collected during interviews with santeros, babalawos, and paleros, and on her descriptions of religious ceremonies.
There is a dialectical relationship between Afro-Cuban religious writing and Cabrera&#x27;s work; she used a religious writing tradition that has now internalized her own ethnography.

==Early life and education==
Born in Havana in 1899 as the youngest of eight siblings, Cabrera came from a family of high socio-economic status in Cuba. Her father, Raimundo Cabrera, was a writer, lawyer, prominent man in society, and an advocate for Cuba&#x27;s independence. Her mother, Elisa Marcaida Casanova, was a housewife and respected socialite. Her father was also the president of the first Cuban corporation, La Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País, founded in the eighteenth century. He owned a popular literary journal, &quot;Cuba y America&quot;, where Lydia got her first experience as a writer. At the age of thirteen, Cabrera wrote a weekly anonymous column that appeared in her father&#x27;s journal. She covered topics relevant to her specific community, such as wedding announcements, births, or obituaries.

The family had many Afro-Cuban servants and child caretakers, through whom young Lydia learned about African folklore, stories, tradition, and religions. Like the majority of wealthy Cubans in the early 1900s, the family had private tutors who came to the home of the Cabreras to educate the children. For a short period of time, she attended the private school of Maria Luisa Dolz. At that time it was not socially acceptable for a woman to pursue a high school diploma, so Cabrera finished her secondary education on her own.

By 1927 Cabrera wanted to make money on her own and to become independent of her family. She moved to Paris to study art and religion at L&#x27;Ecole du Louvre She studied drawing and painting in Paris with theatrical Russian exile Alexandra Exter. Cabrera lived in Paris for 11 years and returned home in 1938. After graduating from Ecole du Louvre, she did not become an artist as expected, instead moving back to Cuba to study Afro-Cuban culture, especially their traditions and folklore.

In 1936, while in Paris, she published her first book, &quot;Cuentos Negros&quot;.

==Involvement in Afrocubanismo and the preservation of Afro-Cuban culture==

For most of her life, Cabrera had a large interest in Afro-Cuban culture. She had been introduced to their folklore at a very young age by her Afro-Cuban nanny and Afro-Cuban seamstress. Three factors influenced her decision to study Afrocubanismo as an adult. The first influence was her experience in Europe, where studying African art became very popular. Secondly she was influenced by her studies in Paris, where she began to see the large influence that African art had on Cuban art. Thirdly she had as a companion Teresa de la Parra, a Venezuelan novelist and socialite whom she met while studying in Europe, and who enjoyed reading Cuban books with her. They often studied the island together.

With her focus on thoroughly exploring Afro-Cuban culture, she returned to Cuba in 1930. She moved to a ranch, La Quinta San Jose, in the suburb of Havana, Marianao, located just outside the barrio Pogolotti where she conducted most her research on Afro-Cuban culture. Between 1937 and 1948, she published her second book of short stories &quot;Por Que...Cuentos negros de Cuba&quot;. For this collection, she participated in the culture of the Afro-Cubans and recorded their religious rituals and traditions.

During the late 1950s she continued to publish several books about Afro-Cuban religions, especially focusing on the Abakuá. Being a secret society, the Abakuás were reluctant to talk to her about their religion. Since they did not accept women as members, Cabrera relied on the use of interviews to gain information for her book. It focused on the origins of the group, the myth of Sikaneke, and the hierarchy of its members. Somehow she managed to photograph their sacred drum, which is supposed to remain hidden at all times, to include within her research.

==Main work themes==

Her career spanned decades before the Revolution, as well as many years after the revolution in Cuba. Although she was never schooled in anthropology, she takes a very anthropological approach to studying her subject matter. The main theme in her work is the focus on to the once-marginalized Afro-Cubans, giving them a respectable identity. Through the use of imagery and storytelling in her work, she seeks to retell the history of the Cuban people through the Afro-Cuban lens. Generally, her work blurs the line between what society has deemed as &quot;fact&quot; and &quot;fiction.&quot; She attempts to pose ideas and theories that force one to question what they have been told. In Afro-Cuban Tales (&quot;Cuentos Negros De Cuba&quot;) she writes, &quot;They dance when they&#x27;re born, they dance when they die, they dance for killings. They celebrate everything!&quot; (Cabrera 67). Here, she is connecting Afro-Cuban tales with African rituals because it is important to celebrate birth, passage to adulthood, marriage, and death.

==Coming to the United States==

She left the country in 1960 shortly after the revolution and never returned. She left as an exile, first going to Madrid and later settling in Miami, FL., where she remained the rest of her life. Ms. Cabrera received several honorary doctorate degrees, including one from the University of Miami in 1987. Cabrera describes her stories as &quot;transpositions,&quot; but they went much further than a simple retelling. She recreated and altered elements, characters, and themes of African and universal folklore, but she also modified the traditional stories by adding details of Cuban customs of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Toward the last years of her life, Lydia Cabrera worked diligently to edit and publish the many notes she had collected during more than thirty years of research in Cuba.

The real reason why she left is still unknown. Some claim that she left because of the lifestyle the revolution was trying to instill. For many years, Cabrera had stated her dislike for the revolution and its communist ideology. Others claim she left because members of the Abakuá were hunting her down since she had made their secret society public. Although the reason why she left is unknown, she never returned and spent the rest of her life living in Miami until her death on September 19, 1991.

<text>Christian terrorism, a form of religious terrorism, refers to terrorist acts which are committed by groups or individuals who profess Christian motivations or goals. Christian terrorists justify their violent tactics through their interpretation of the Bible and Christianity, in accordance with their own objectives and worldview.

Christian terrorism can be committed against members of other Christian denominations, adherents of other religions, secular governments, groups, individuals or society as a whole. Christianity can also be cynically misused as a rhetorical device to achieve political or military goals by terrorists.

Christian terrorist groups include paramilitary organizations, cults, and loose groups of people that might come together in order to attempt to terrorize other groups. Some groups also encourage unaffiliated individuals to commit terrorist acts. The paramilitary groups are typically tied to ethnic and political goals as well as religious goals and many of these groups have religious beliefs which are at odds with the religious beliefs of conventional Christianity.

== Terminology ==
The literal use of the phrase Christian terrorism is disputed. It appears in the academic literature to describe a large range of actions and beliefs.

Religion can be cited as the motivation for terrorism in conflicts that have a variety of ethnic, economic and political causes, such as the one in Bosnia. In cases such as the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army or the Taiping Rebellion the beliefs of the founders differ significantly from what is recognizably Christian. In such cases the term Christian terrorism is problematic despite the claim that they are motivated by their religious beliefs.

The intimidation of minority communities along with sporadic acts of violence do not typically get referred to as terrorism. However, in 2015 a majority of Americans from the Democratic and Republican political parties thought that &quot;attacks on abortion providers [should] be considered domestic terrorism&quot;.

== History ==

Christianity came to prominence in the Roman Empire during and directly after the rule of Constantine the Great (324–337 AD). By this time, it had spread throughout western Asia as a minority belief, and it had become the state religion of Armenia. In early Christianity, there were many rival sects, which were collectively persecuted by some rulers. There is, however, generally no record of these early Christian groups attempting to use acts of terrorism or indiscriminate acts of violence as religious weapons, though the Donatists fought a guerilla war against the mainstream church and the state, blinding Catholic priests to make their point.

Gaining state backing by a particular Christian sect or creed led to an increase in religious violence. This violence took the form of persecution of adherents of rival Christian beliefs and persecution of adherents of other religions. In Europe during the Middle Ages, Christian antisemitism increased, and both the Reformation and Counter-Reformation led to an increase in interdenominational violence. As with modern examples, it is debated as to what extent these acts were religious as opposed to ethnic or political in nature.

=== Gunpowder Plot ===
The early modern period in Britain saw religious conflict resulting from the Reformation and the recusancy that emerged in opposition to it. The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed attempt by a group of English Catholics to assassinate the Protestant King James I, and to blow up the Palace of Westminster, the English seat of government. Although the modern concept of religious terrorism, or indeed terrorism at all, had not yet come into use in the seventeenth century, David C. Rapoport and Lindsay Clutterbuck point out that the Plot, with its use of explosives, was an early precursor of nineteenth century anarchist terrorism. Sue Mahan and Pamala L. Griset classify the plot as an act of religious terrorism, writing that &quot;Fawkes and his colleagues justified their actions in terms of religion.&quot; Peter Steinfels also characterizes this plot as a notable case of religious terrorism.

=== Pogroms ===
Eastern Orthodox Christian-influenced movements in Romania, such as the Iron Guard and Lăncieri, which have been characterized by Yad Vashem and Stanley G. Payne as antisemitic and fascist, respectively, were involved in the Bucharest pogrom and committed numerous politically motivated murders during the 1930s.

=== Ku Klux Klan ===
After the American Civil War of 1861–1865, former Confederate soldiers founded the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) organization. Originally, the Ku Klux Klan was a social club, but a year after it was founded, it was taken over by &quot;night rider&quot; elements. It then began to commit acts of violence which included arson, beatings, the destruction of property, lynchings, murder, rape, tarring and feathering, whipping, and voter intimidation. The Klan targeted newly freed slaves, carpetbaggers, scalawags, and the occupying Union Army. That iteration of the Klan disappeared by the 1870s, but in 1915 a new Protestant-led iteration of the Klan was formed in Georgia, during a period when racism, xenophobia, nativism and anti-Catholicism were all widespread. This version of the Klan vastly expanded its geographical reach and its list of targets over those of the original Klan.
Vehemently anti-Catholic, the 1915 Klan espoused an explicitly Protestant Christian terrorist ideology, partially basing its beliefs on a &quot;religious foundation&quot; in Protestant Christianity and targeting Jews, Catholics, and other social, ethnic and religious minorities, as well as people who engaged in &quot;immoral&quot; practices such as adulterers, bad debtors, gamblers, and alcohol abusers. From an early time onward, the goals of the KKK included an intent to &quot;reestablish Protestant Christian values in America by any means possible&quot;, and it believed that &quot;Jesus was the first Klansman&quot;. Although members of the KKK swear to uphold Christian morality, virtually every Christian denomination has officially denounced the KKK.

From 1915 onward, &quot;second era&quot; Klansmen initiated cross burnings (adapted from scenes in the 1915 film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;), not only to intimidate targets, but also to demonstrate their respect and reverence for Jesus Christ. The ritual of lighting crosses was steeped in Christian symbolism, including prayer and hymn singing. Modern Klan organizations remain associated with acts of domestic terrorism in the United States.

=== Start of modern terrorism ===
Mark Juergensmeyer, a former president of the American Academy of Religion, has argued that there has been a global rise in religious nationalism after the Cold War due to the post-colonial collapse of confidence in Western models of nationalism and the rise of globalization. Juergensmeyer categorizes contemporary Christian terrorists as being a part of &quot;religious activists from Algeria to Idaho, who have come to hate secular governments with an almost transcendent passion and dream of revolutionary changes that will establish a godly social order in the rubble of what the citizens of most secular societies regard as modern, egalitarian democracies&quot;.

According to terrorism expert David C. Rapoport, a &quot;religious wave&quot;, or a cycle, of terrorism, dates from approximately 1979 to the present. According to Rapoport, this wave most prominently features Islamic terrorism, but it also includes terrorism by Christians and other religious groups that may have been influenced by Islamic terrorism.

== Reason for claiming a Christian motivation ==
Numerous individuals and groups have cited their Christianity or Christian beliefs as the motivation for their terrorist acts. This can mean that they see Christianity as their identity and the main reason for their existence, partially in contrast to the identities and existence of other groups which they consider threatening and non-Christian. Terrorists can also cite their interpretation of the Bible or Christian beliefs as their motivation. All types of terrorism have a complex interrelationship with psychology and mental health; however, only a minority of terrorists have diagnosable medical illnesses. Christianity can also be claimed as a motive to inspire followers or curry political favor or protection. All these motivations are not independent and often complexly interwoven.

=== Christianity as an identity ===
Religion is often closely tied to ethnic identity, economic standing and self image. Should a group of Christians feel threatened, religion is a verifiable, culturally important label to use in creating a &quot;them-and-us&quot; mentality. This is particularly the case where both groups share membership in a broadly similar cultural group, for example the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army in Uganda. In situations where the opposing ethnicities are more diverse, different skin colors and/or cultural practices are sometimes used as identifiers of the other. In these cases terrorists may call themselves Christians, but they may not be motivated by any particular interpretation of Christian beliefs. In such cases Christianity is a label which reflects cultural, rather than directly ideological, influences.

This cultural Christian identity is often reinforced in the mind of the terrorist by media and governmental sources that vilify the other group or amplify its threat. This politicizing of ethno-religious tensions is a key contributor to the violence in the Central African Republic. The targets of this kind of terrorist motivation include other religions or denominations, but they can also include those who the perpetrator believes are threatening to him or her in any way, such as LGBT people or members of any group which does not conform to the perpetrator&#x27;s view of who they are.

When the opposing group is also Christian but belongs to a different denomination, it is often denounced as non-Christian or anti-Christian. For example, the leader of the Orange Volunteers, who described themselves as Protestant fundamentalists, defended their attacks on Catholic churches on the basis that they were &quot;bastions of the Antichrist&quot;.

=== Interpretations of Christian morality or theology ===
Perpetrators have frequently cited Christianity as both a justification and a motivation for their actions. Typically, as with attacks on abortion clinics as well as with attacks on LGBT people, the perpetrators use doctrine from an established Church as a justification for unsanctioned acts of violence. However, they may also have a wholly individual theology that deviates from established Christian dogma.

On 12 December 2022, a fundamentalist Christian terror attack that resulted in the deaths of six people occurred in Wieambilla, Queensland, Australia. Premillennialism was cited by police as the terrorists&#x27; motivation.

=== Mental health ===
There are a wide variety of mental health conditions and illness, and it is quite rare for them to lead to violence. Objectively determining the mental health of a terrorist is often complicated by a number of factors. There is minimal statistically robust information specifically on terrorists who claim Christian motivation. However, Gill says that about 30% of right wing, 52% of single issue, and 8% of those in a terrorist group have a mental illness. Another study found that about 53% of individual terrorists could have been characterized as socially isolated before their attacks. People in some terrorist groups are less likely to have a mental illness than the general population, due to the selection criteria of such groups. Mental illness does not seem to unduly prevent terrorists from performing successful complex attacks.

== Tactics of terrorists ==

Terrorists who claim to have a Christian motivation can act alone or in groups. It is often difficult to determine if the perpetrator acted completely alone or was inspired by a religious or political group. The same problem exists with Islamic terrorism or any allegedly religiously or politically motivated act of terror.

=== Anti-abortion violence ===

On 16 July 2001, Peter James Knight walked into the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic, a private abortion provider, carrying a rifle and other weapons including 16 litres of kerosene, three lighters, torches, 30 gags, and a handwritten note that read &quot;We regret to advise that as a result of a fatal accident involving some members of staff, we have been forced to cancel all appointments today&quot;. Knight later stated that he intended to massacre everyone in the clinic, and attack all Melbourne abortion clinics. He developed homemade mouth gags and door jambs to restrain all patients and staff inside a clinic while he doused them with the kerosene. He shot 44-year-old Stephen Gordon Rogers, a security guard, in the chest, killing him. Staff and clients overpowered him soon after. He intended to massacre the 15 staff and 26 patients at the clinic by burning them alive.

According to psychiatrist Don Sendipathy, Knight interpreted the Bible in his own unique way and he also believed in his own brand of Christianity. He believed that he needed to wage an anti-abortion Crusade.

Eric Robert Rudolph (the perpetrator of the Centennial Olympic Park bombing in 1996) carried out bombing attacks on two abortion clinics and he also bombed a lesbian nightclub. Michael Barkun, a professor at Syracuse University, believes that Rudolph likely fits the definition of a Christian terrorist; however, James A. Aho, a professor at Idaho State University, is reluctant to use the phrase Christian terrorist, so he calls Rudolph &quot;a religiously inspired terrorist&quot;.

Dr. George Tiller, one of the few doctors in the United States who performed abortions late in pregnancies, was a frequent target of anti-abortion violence and in 2009, he was killed by Scott Roeder as he stood in the foyer of his church. A witness who was serving as an usher alongside Tiller at the church that day told the court that Roeder entered the foyer, put a gun to the doctor&#x27;s head and pulled the trigger. At trial, Roeder admitted to killing Tiller and he said that he did it in order to protect the lives of unborn babies. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. At his sentencing, he told the court that God &quot;will avenge every drop of innocent blood,&quot; and he also stated that God’s judgment against the United States would &quot;sweep over this land like a prairie wind.&quot;

Tiller was shot once before, in 1993, by Shelley Shannon, an anti-abortion activist who compared abortion providers to Hitler and said that she believed that &quot;justifiable force&quot; was necessary to stop abortions. Shannon was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the shooting of Tiller and she later confessed to vandalizing and burning a string of abortion clinics in California, Nevada and Oregon.

James Kopp was convicted of the murder of Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician who provided abortion services in the Buffalo area, and he has also been named as a suspect in the shooting of several abortion providers in Canada. Kopp hid in the woods behind Slepian&#x27;s home in October 1998 and shot him through the window with a high-powered rifle, killing him as he stood in his kitchen with his family. Slepian had just returned from a memorial service for his father when he was killed. Kopp spent almost two and a half years on the run in Mexico, Ireland and France before he was captured and extradited to the United States in 2001. He was convicted on a state charge of second-degree murder in 2003 and sentenced to serve 25 years in prison. In 2007, he was convicted on a separate federal charge and sentenced to life in prison. The Canadian authorities also consider Kopp a suspect in several nonlethal attacks on Canadian abortion service providers because they believe that he shot through the windows of their homes. He was charged with the 1995 attempted murder of Dr. Hugh Short, an abortion service provider in Ontario, but the charges were dropped after he was convicted in New York. The police in Canada also named him as a suspect in the 1997 shooting of Dr. Jack Fainman in Winnipeg and they also named him as a suspect in the 1994 shooting of Dr. Garson Romalis in Vancouver, which was the first attack on an abortion provider in Canada.

The November 2015 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting, in which three people were killed and nine people were injured, was described as &quot;a form of terrorism&quot; by Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. The gunman, Robert Lewis Dear, was described as a &quot;delusional&quot; man because on a cannabis internet forum, he had written that &quot;sinners&quot; would &quot;burn in hell&quot; during the end times, and he had also written about smoking marijuana and propositioning women for sex. He had praised the Army of God, stating that attacks on abortion clinics are &quot;God&#x27;s work&quot;. Dear&#x27;s ex-wife said that he had put glue on a lock of a Planned Parenthood clinic, and in court documents which pertained to their divorce, she said &quot;He claims to be a Christian and is extremely evangelistic, but does not follow the Bible in his actions. He says that as long as he believes he will be saved, he can do whatever he pleases. He is obsessed with the world coming to an end.&quot; Authorities said that he spoke of &quot;no more baby parts&quot; in an interview after his arrest.

The Army of God is an American Christian terrorist organization; its members have perpetrated acts of anti-abortion violence.

=== Anti-minority violence ===
Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder were a gay couple from Redding, California, who were murdered by Benjamin Matthew Williams and James Tyler Williams in 1999. Neighbors said that the family of the Williams Brothers was known for its fundamentalist Christian beliefs, and they also said that recordings of sermons and religious music were frequently heard from their house. The two perpetrators of the murder are believed to have had ties to the Christian Identity movement. They were also suspected of playing a role in 18 arson attacks on three synagogues.

In 1996, three men who claimed to be Phineas priests—Charles Barbee, Robert Berry and Jay Merelle—were charged with two bank robberies and bombings at the banks, the bombing of a Spokane newspaper, and the bombing of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Washington state. The men were antisemitic Christian Identity theorists who believed that God wanted them to carry out violent attacks and they also believed that such attacks would hasten the ascendancy of the Aryan race.

In 2015, Robert Doggart, a 63-year-old mechanical engineer, was indicted for solicitation to commit a civil rights violation by intending to damage or destroy religious property after he stated that he intended to amass weapons and attack Islamberg, an Islamic hamlet and religious community in Delaware County, New York. Doggart, a member of several private militia groups, spoke to an FBI source during a phone call and stated that he had an M4 carbine with &quot;500 rounds of ammunition&quot; that he intended to take to the Delaware County enclave, along with a handgun, Molotov cocktails and a machete. The FBI source recorded him saying &quot;if it gets down to the machete, we will cut them to shreds&quot;. Doggart had previously travelled to a site in Dover, Tennessee, which had been described as a &quot;jihadist training camp&quot;, in chain emails and found that the claims were wrong. In April, Doggart accepted a plea bargain and stated that he had &quot;willfully and knowingly sent a message in interstate commerce containing a true threat&quot; to injure someone. The plea bargain was struck down by a judge because it did not contain enough facts to constitute a true threat. Doggart describes himself as a Christian minister in the &quot;Christian National (Congregational) Church&quot; (apparently, the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches). None of the charges against him are terrorism related, however, some groups have described his actions as such.

According to University of Auckland Professor Douglas Pratt, who is an international expert on religious terrorism, the Christchurch mosque shootings by Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant, which killed 51 people and injured 50 more people (primarily Muslims) at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, were a form of &quot;Christian terrorism&quot; and white supremacy. Tarrant&#x27;s manifesto &quot;The Great Replacement&quot;, which is named after the French far-right conspiracy theory bearing the same name, quoted Pope Urban II (who ordered the First Crusade) and demanded the retaking of Jerusalem, cited the death of 11-year-old Swedish girl Ebba Akerlund, cited NATO&#x27;s involvement in Kosovo, stated Tarrant&#x27;s wish that Istanbul (aka Constantinople) should be taken from Turkey so it will be back in Christian hands and he finally stated that Tarrant&#x27;s main motive for the attacks was revenge against Islam. The shooter&#x27;s rifles were covered with white supremacist symbols and the names of various historical non-Muslim figures who waged battles against Muslims, such as Charles Martel, Skanderbeg and Bajo Pivljanin as well as the Battle of Tours in 732 and the Battle of Vienna in 1683.

The perpetrator of the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue shooting Robert Bowers paraphrased a section of , stating &quot;Jews are the children of Satan&quot; on the bio of his now defunct Gab account. Similarly, the Poway synagogue shooting suspect John T. Earnest also cited Bible quotes to justify his attack and in March 2019, he attempted to burn down a mosque in Escondido, California but failed.

<text>John Michael Hardwick (December 31, 1958 – c. August 8, 2023) was an American voice actor, comedian, writer, producer and YouTuber. He was best known as the voice of Dale Gribble in the animated American television series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. He also served as a staff writer, story editor, and producer on the show. He was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards three times, winning once in 1999 with the rest of &quot;King of the Hill&quot;″s production team.

==Early life==
John Michael Hardwick was born in Austin, Texas, on December 31, 1958. He attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock. After graduating with a BA degree in journalism, he worked for a decade as a bartender in live blues bars in Dallas and Austin, including Nick&#x27;s Uptown, Sixth Street Live and The Greenville Bar &amp; Grill.

==Career==
Starting in 1990, Hardwick performed stand-up comedy for a number of years, appearing at such venues as the Dallas Improv and the Velveeta Room in Austin and appearing on shows including &quot;Evening at the Improv&quot; and Caroline&#x27;s Comedy Hour. He was the first comic to appear on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot;. In 1995, he worked the Montreal Comedy Festival, where Brandon Tartikoff saw his set and signed him to a sitcom on NBC, which never materialized.

After Hardwick signed with the Strauss-McGarr agency, he was continually booked in stand-up across the United States. While at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, he performed a set about his father in Texas. Afterward, he was approached by television writers and producers Greg Daniels and Mike Judge, who were helping create the Texan-themed comedy &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

The role of Dale Gribble was originally offered to Daniel Stern, but producers were unable to agree with Stern on a salary. Instead, Hardwick won it by not arguing about money. He performed the role for the show&#x27;s entire 13-year run and appeared in 257 of 258 episodes. At the time of his death, he was set to reprise the role again in the upcoming revival. It was later revealed that Hardwick had recorded &quot;a couple&quot; of new episodes for the revival prior to his death.

On September 12, 2012, Hardwick created a YouTube channel, though it had no uploads until 2015. In December 2018, he started regularly uploading new content. As of May 2023, the channel had 17,500 subscribers and over 608,000 views, primarily streaming song parodies and monologues in Dale&#x27;s voice.

==Death==
On August 8, 2023, Hardwick was found dead face-up in the bathtub at his home in Austin following a welfare check by local authorities. He was 64 years old at the time of his death. In November, it was reported that the moderate decomposition of his body left the cause and manner of death unable to be established, but the examiner noted that his death appeared to be relatively sudden, that drowning was unlikely, and there were no obvious signs of trauma. His body also tested positive for cannabinoids, and there were unspecified drugs found at the scene.

<doc id="566927" wikidata="Q6773891" url="?curid=566927" title="Marsham Towers">
<text>The Marsham Towers were three government buildings at the corner of Marsham Street and Great Peter Street in Westminster, London. They served as the headquarters of the Department of the Environment.

==Redevelopment==
The redevelopment of the site was long planned. The site was originally a gas works and had first included two gas holders (built 1875), renovated in World War 2 for use as bomb shelter &#x27;citadels&#x27;—the North Rotunda and the South Rotunda. A new &#x27;steel-framed building&#x27; was also added in 1940/41. Both rotundas were designed to survive the impact of a 500 lb bomb and had concrete roofs. In 1943 the lowest level of the North Rotunda (codenamed &quot;Anson&quot;) was kitted out as the reserve to the Cabinet War Rooms. The previous reserve Paddock in Dollis Hill was seen to be unsatisfactory and too far from Whitehall.

By the early 1960s, the increasing numbers of civil servants led to the commissioning of Eric Bedford (1909–2001), chief architect for the Ministry of Public Building and Works, to design a headquarters building for three separate ministries, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Public Building and Works. His design, published in 1963, placed three twenty-storey slab blocks parallel north to south on top of a three-storey podium slab raised on stilts. Each tower had exposed concrete framing, being built in a new &#x27;box-shell&#x27; system which mixed pre-cast concrete and on-site construction. They were tall. The towers incorporated the rotundas in the base and were completed in 1971.

The rotundas were used as a communications centre and a civil service sports club, amongst other things. By the time the towers were complete, the three separate ministries had merged into the Department of the Environment, and having separate towers proved inefficient. The bland frontage of the blocks, described in Nikolaus Pevsner&#x27;s architectural guides as &quot;the very image of faceless bureaucracy&quot;, was much criticised and local people nicknamed them &quot;the three ugly sisters&quot;.
Michael Heseltine announced on 6 February 1992 that he proposed to knock the building down. In 1996 an architectural competition was held for a mixed-use replacement but did not produce a clear outcome. Eventually it was decided to build a replacement for the Home Office on the site and the towers were taken down in 2002/03. The site is now occupied by Sir Terry Farrell&#x27;s new building at 2 Marsham Street, which the Home Office first occupied in February 2005 and a housing development containing just over 100 apartments called New Palace Place.

<text>Pardah or purdah (from Hindi-Urdu , , meaning &quot;curtain&quot;) is a religious and social practice of gender partition prevalent among some Muslim and Hindu communities. It takes two forms: social partition of the sexes and the requirement that women cover their bodies so as to cover their skin and conceal their form. A woman who practices purdah can be referred to as &#x27; or &#x27;. The term &quot;purdah&quot; is also used in English as a metaphor to describe practices such as the pre-election period of sensitivity occurring in the weeks leading up to a general election or referendum.

Practices that restricted women&#x27;s mobility and behavior existed among religious groups in India since ancient times and intensified with the arrival of Islam. By the 19th century, purdah became customary among Hindu elites. Purdah was not traditionally observed by lower-class women.

Physical segregation within buildings is achieved with judicious use of walls, curtains, and screens. A woman&#x27;s withdrawal into purdah usually restricts her personal, social and economic activities outside her home. The usual purdah garment worn is a burqa, which may or may not include a yashmak, a veil to conceal the face. The eyes may or may not be exposed.

Married Hindu women in parts of Northern India observe purdah, with some women wearing a ghoonghat in the presence of older male relations on their husbands&#x27; side; Muslim women observe purdah through the wearing of a burqa.

Purdah has been rigorously observed under the Taliban in Afghanistan, where women are forced to observe complete purdah at all times while in public. Only close male family members and other women are allowed to see them out of purdah. In other societies, purdah is often only practised during certain times of religious significance.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;purdah&quot; is derived from the Hindi-Urdu word &quot;pardā&quot;, which itself is derived from the Persian (pardeh, پرده) from Middle Persian &quot;pltk&quot;&#x27; (pardag), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*pel-&quot; (&quot;to cover, wrap; hide, cloth&quot;).

==History==

===Pre-Islamic origins===
In ancient Indian society, &quot;practices that restricted women&#x27;s social mobility and behavior&quot; existed but the arrival of Islam in India &quot;intensified these Hindu practices, and by the 19th century purdah was the customary practice of high-caste Hindu and elite communities throughout India.&quot;

Although purdah is commonly associated with Islam, many scholars argue that veiling and secluding women pre-dates Islam; these practices were commonly found among various groups in the Middle East such as Druze, Christian, and Jewish communities. For instance, the burqa existed in Arabia before Islam, and the mobility of upper-class women was restricted in Babylonia, Persian, and Byzantine Empires before the advent of Islam. Historians believe purdah was acquired by the Muslims during the expansion of the Arab Empire into modern-day Iraq in the 7th century C.E and that Islam merely added religious significance to already existing local practices of the times.

=== Later history===
Muslim rule of northern India during the Mughal Empire influenced the practice of Hinduism, and the purdah spread to the Hindu upper classes of northern India. The spread of purdah outside of the Muslim community can be attributed to the tendency of affluent classes to mirror the societal practices of the nobility; poor women did not observe purdah. Lower-class women in small villages often worked in fields, and therefore could not afford to abandon their work to be secluded. During the British colonial period in India, purdah observance was widespread and strictly adhered to among the Muslim minority.

In modern times, the practice of veiling and secluding women is still present in mainly Islamic countries, communities and South Asian countries. However, the practice is not monolithic. Purdah takes on different forms and significance depending on the region, time, socioeconomic status, and local culture. It is most commonly associated with some Muslim communities in Afghanistan and Pakistan, along with Saudi Arabia. Purdah has been more recently adopted in northern Nigeria, especially in areas affected by the Boko Haram uprising. It is also observed by Rajput clans of India and Pakistan as a social practice regardless of religion.

==Rationale==

===Protection and subjugation ===

Some scholars argue that the purdah was initially designed to protect women from being harassed, but later these practices became a way to justify efforts to subjugate women and limit their mobility and freedom. However, others argue that these practices were always in place as local custom, but were later adopted by religious rhetoric to control female behavior.

===Respect===

Proponents of the practice view purdah as a symbol of honor, respect, and dignity. It is seen as a practice that allows women to be judged by their inner beauty rather than physical beauty.

===Economic ===

In many societies, the seclusion of women to the domestic sphere is a demonstration of higher socioeconomic status and prestige because women are not needed for manual labor outside the home.

In the past around the 1970s, upper and middle-class women in towns in Pakistan would wear burqas over their normal clothes in public. The burqa was the most visible dress in Pakistan. It is typically a tent-like garment worn over the ordinary clothes and is made of white cotton. Many upper-class women wear a two-piece burqa which is usually black in colour but sometimes navy blue or dark red. It consists of a long cloak and a separate headpiece with a drop-down face veil. Some educated urban women no longer wear the burqa. The burqa is also not worn by rural peasant women who work in the fields. In rural areas only elite women wear burqas. Purdah is still common in the rural elite and urban middle class, but not among rural farmers.

===Individual motivations===

The rationales of individual women for keeping purdah are complex and can be a combination of motivations, freely chosen or in response to social pressure or coercion: religious, cultural (desire for authentic cultural dress), political (Islamization of the society), economic (status symbol, protection from the public gaze), psychological (detachment from public sphere to gain respect), fashion and decorative purposes, and &quot;empowerment&quot; (donning veils to move in public spaces controlled by men).

==Examples of purdah==

The following reminiscence from C.M. Naim describes the evolution of purdah during the first third of the 20th century among the sharif or genteel people of Avadh, United Provinces, British India:

The word ‘Hijab&#x27; is relatively new for me. It was not a part of my vocabulary as I was growing up. I learned it much later, when I began to read literary and religious Urdu texts. ... The relevant word that I learned growing up was &quot;purdah&quot;. And I learned the word and its many meanings in the observed practice of the various female members of my middle-class family in Bara Banki, a small town in north India.

For Ammi, my grandmother, purdah meant almost never venturing out of the house. On the rare occasions when she did, it was always an elaborate ritual. Visiting a family in the neighbourhood – only on the occasion of some tragedy, ... she used a &quot;doli&quot;. The little stool slung from a pole that two men carried would be brought to our back door – the door to the zanana or the ladies&#x27; section – and the two carriers would step away behind the curtain wall. Ammi would wrap herself in a white sheet and squat on the flat stool, and a heavy custom-made cover would be thrown over her and the doli. The two bearers would then come back and carry the doli away on their shoulders. ... When Ammi traveled in my father&#x27;s car, she covered herself the same way, while the back seat of the car where she sat was made completely invisible by pieces of cloth hung across the windows.

Apa, my mother, belonged to the next generation. She used a burqa. Hers was a two piece ‘modern&#x27; outfit, as opposed to the one-piece – derisively called ‘the shuttlecock&#x27; by my sisters – that was preferred by the older or more conservatively spirited in the family. I also remember that the older generation&#x27;s burqas were usually white, while the new burqas were always black.

Apa’s burqa’ consisted of a skirt and a separate top throw – one that covered her from the head to the thighs. The two pieces allowed for easier movement of both arms and legs. The top had a separate veil hanging over the face, which Apa could throw back in the company of women, e.g. while traveling in the ladies compartment on a train, or hold partly aside to look at things more closely when she went shopping. Apa wore a burqa all her life, except of course when she went to Mecca for Hajj. There she wore the same sheets of ihram that Ammi had to earlier. Like all women pilgrims then and now, she too exposed her face to everyone’s sight but not her hair.

... I should not neglect to mention that in those days – I’m talking about the Forties – it was considered improper even for Hindu ladies of certain classes to be seen in public with their hair and faces uncovered, particularly the married women. They never wore a burqa – that was for Muslims alone. Instead, they used a shawl, a plain white sheet, or the &quot;palloo&quot; of their saris to cover what was not for strangers to see. They too lived in houses that had separate women’s quarters. Their daughters traveled to school daily in a covered wagon that was pushed by two men, just like their Muslim counterparts. (The school was exclusively for girls and had a very high wall surrounding it.)
A different form of veiling, the ghoonghat, is found among some married Hindu women in rural North India. A fold of the sari is drawn over the face when the woman is in the presence of older male in-laws or in a place where there is likelihood of meeting them, e.g. the in-laws&#x27; village. It is not worn otherwise, for example, when visiting her mother&#x27;s home or in a location far from the in-laws&#x27; village. Hindu women in other parts of India—south, east, west (below Gujarat)—do not veil themselves.

For both Hindu and Muslim women in the eastern part of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, having a &quot;separate women&#x27;s quarters within the house&quot; is commonplace among families who can afford it.

==Conduct and seclusion==

Another important aspect of purdah is modesty for women, which includes minimizing the movement of women in public spaces and interactions of women with other males. The specific form varies widely based on religion, region, class, and culture. For instance, for some purdah might mean never leaving the home unless accompanied by a male relative, or limiting interactions to only other women and male relatives (for some Muslims) or avoiding all males outside of the immediate family (for some Hindus). For Muslims, seclusion begins at puberty while for Hindus, seclusion begins after marriage.

==Effects==

===Psychology and health===

By restricting women&#x27;s mobility, purdah results in the social and physical isolation of women. Lack of a strong social network places women in a position of vulnerability with her husband and her husband&#x27;s family. Studies have shown that in conservative rural Bangladeshi communities, adherence to purdah is positively correlated with the risk of domestic violence. The restriction on women&#x27;s mobility limits their ability to access health care and family planning services, especially for unmarried girls. In rural Pakistan, unmarried women and girls had trouble accessing healthcare facilities even in their own villages due to purdah; all types of women had difficulty accessing facilities outside of their villages because they had to be accompanied. Along the same vein, studies of women&#x27;s contraceptive use in Bangladesh shows that women with decreased observance of purdah and increased mobility are more likely to use contraceptives.

===Economic participation===

By restricting women&#x27;s mobility, purdah places severe limits on women&#x27;s ability to participate in gainful employment and to attain economic independence. The ideology of purdah constricts women in the domestic sphere for reproductive role and places men in productive role as breadwinners who move through public space. However, due to economic needs and shifts in gender relations, some women are compelled to break purdah to gain income. Across countries, women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to observe purdah less because they face greater financial pressures to work and gain income. Studies show that &quot;it is the poorest, most desperate families that, given the opportunity, are more willing to stress purdah norms and take the social risks entailed when women engage in wage or self-employment. For instance, rural women in Bangladesh have been found to be less concerned with propriety and purdah, and take up work where available, migrating if they need to. They take up work in a variety of sectors from agriculture to manufacturing to the sex trade. However, other studies found that purdah still plays a significant role in women&#x27;s decisions to participate in the workforce, often prohibiting them from taking opportunities they would otherwise. The degree to which women observe purdah and the pressures they face to conform or to earn income vary with their socioeconomic class.

===Political participation===

Social and mobility restrictions under purdah severely limit women&#x27;s involvement in political decision-making in government institutions and in the judiciary. Lack of mobility and discouragement from participating in political life means women cannot easily exercise their right to vote, run for political office, participate in trade unions, or participate in community level decision-making. Women&#x27;s limited participation in political decision-making therefore results in policies that do not sufficiently address needs and rights of women in areas such as access to healthcare, education and employment opportunities, property ownership, justice, and others. Gender imbalance in policy-making also reinforces institutionalization of gender disparities.

==Influences on purdah==
===Governmental policies on purdah===
In Tunisia and formerly Turkey, religious veiling is banned in public schools, universities, and government buildings as a measure to discourage displays of political Islam or fundamentalism. Turkey reversed the long-standing ban in 2013. In western Europe, veiling is seen as symbol of Islamic presence, and movements to ban veils have stirred great controversy. For instance, since 2004 France has banned all overt religious symbols in schools including the Muslim headscarf. In Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh where the word purdah is primarily used, the government has no policies either for or against veiling.

===Islamization===
Nations such as Pakistan have been swinging to more conservative laws and policies that use rhetoric of following Islamic law, sometimes termed Islamization. The ideology is reinforcing traditional culture, traditional women&#x27;s roles in the domestic sphere, and the need to protect women&#x27;s honor. The result is policies that reinforce cultural norms that limit female mobility in the public sphere, promotion of gender segregation, and institutionalization of gender disparities.

===Women&#x27;s movements===
Women have been engaging in efforts to challenge the gender inequality resulting from purdah. For instance, women in Pakistan have organized trade unions and attempt to exercise their right to vote and influence decision making. However, their opponents accuse these women of falling for the pernicious influence of Westernization and turning their backs on tradition.

In Bengal, feminist activism dates back to the 19th century. For instance, Begum Rokeya and Faizunnesa Choudhurani played a significant role in emancipating Bengali Muslim women from purdah.

===Globalization and migration===
Globalization and Muslim women returning from diasporas has influenced Pakistani women&#x27;s purdah practice in areas outside of religious significance. One major influence is the desire to be modern and keep up with the latest fashions, or refusal to do so as a source of autonomy and power. Simultaneously, due to modernization in many urban areas, purdah and face-veiling are seen as unsophisticated and backwards, creating a trend in less strict observance of purdah.

For the Muslim South Asian diaspora living in secular non-Muslim communities such as Pakistani-Americans, attitudes about purdah have changed to be less strict. As it pertains to education and economic opportunities, these immigrant families hold less conservative views about purdah after moving to America; for the daughters who do choose to wear the veil, they usually do so out of their own volition as a connection to their Islamic roots and culture.

==Controversy around women&#x27;s agency==

===Purdah as oppression===

Purdah has repeatedly been criticized as oppression of women by limiting female autonomy, freedom of movement, and access to resources such as education, employment, and political participation. Some scholars such as P. Singh and Roy interpret purdah as a form of male domination in the public sphere, and an &quot;eclipse of Muslim woman&#x27;s identity and individuality&quot;. According to scholars such as Elizabeth White, &quot;purdah is an accommodation to and a means of perpetuating the perceived differences between the sexes: the male being self-reliant and aggressive, the female weak, irresponsible, and in need of protection&quot;. Geraldine Books writes &quot;in both cases [of spatial separation and veiling], women are expected to sacrifice their comfort and freedom to service the requirements of male sexuality: either to repress or to stimulate the male sex urge&quot;.

When purdah is institutionalized into laws, it limits opportunity, autonomy, and agency in both private and public life. The result is policies that reinforce cultural norms that limit female mobility in the public sphere, promotion of gender segregation, and institutionalization of gender disparities.

Sometimes reactions to purdah adherence can become violent. For instance, in 2001 in Srinagar, India, four young Muslim women were victimized by acid attacks for not veiling themselves in public; similar threats and attacks have occurred in Pakistan and Kashmir.

===Purdah as &quot;protection&quot;===

Some scholars claim that purdah was originally designed to protect women from being harassed and seen as sexual objects. In contemporary times, some men and women still interpret the purdah as a way to protect women&#x27;s safety while moving in public sphere. Observing purdah is also seen as a way to uphold women&#x27;s honor and virtuous conduct. However, critics point out that this view engages victim-blaming and places the onus of preventing sexual assault on women rather than the perpetrators themselves.

== In popular culture and media ==

=== Books ===
&quot;Secluded Women&quot; is criticism of Purdah system by first Muslim feminist and social reformer Bengali writer Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880–1932). &quot;Sultana&#x27;s Dream&quot; is a 1905 feminist utopian story written by Hossain. It depicts a feminist utopia (called Ladyland) in which women run everything and men are secluded, in a mirror-image of the traditional practice of &quot;purdah&quot;. Traditional stereotypes such as “Men have bigger brains” and women are &quot;naturally weak&quot; are countered in &quot;Sultana&#x27;s Dream&quot; with logic such as &quot;an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain&quot; and “a lion is stronger than a man” and yet neither of them dominates men.

<text>ARA &quot;Isla de los Estados&quot; was an Argentine Navy supply ship sunk during the Falklands War.

==Ship history==
The 3,900-ton ship was built in 1975 by the Sociedad Metalúrgica Duro Felguera in Gijón, Spain, as &quot;Trans-Bética&quot;. She was acquired by the Argentine Navy, renamed after the island east of Tierra del Fuego, and commissioned into the Naval Transport Service on 22 December 1980, being used to maintain a regular transport service between the Falkland Islands and the mainland.

===Falklands war===
On 28 March 1982 she sailed from Puerto Deseado to participate in Operation Rosario in the Falkland Islands, arriving on 4 April, three days after the initial landings, to provide transport around the archipelago.

The ship, among many other things, transported troops to occupy Darwin, Goose Green and Fox Bay.

Between 15 and 17 April she sowed mines in the waters surrounding Stanley. These mines had been carried by the ARA &quot;Bahia Buen Suceso&quot;.

===Sinking===
&quot;Isla de los Estados&quot; was sunk by during the first hours of 11 May 1982 in a surface action north of the Swan Islands in Falkland Sound. &quot;Alacrity&quot; engaged &quot;Isla de los Estados&quot; with her 4.5-inch gun. The Argentine transport blew up after several hits ignited her cargo of jet fuel and ammunition. Only two of the 24 men aboard survived; 15 crew members and seven servicemen (from all three armed forces plus the coast guard) were killed or missing.

<doc id="566951" wikidata="Q7643950" url="?curid=566951" title="Supermarket Sweep">
<text>Supermarket Sweep is an American television game show. Teams of contestants answer trivia questions before competing in a timed race to gather grocery items from the aisles of a supermarket. The original show was broadcast on ABC from December 20, 1965 to July 14, 1967. Later seasons aired on Lifetime from February 5, 1990 to June 16, 1995 (with reruns until August 14, 1998, and on PAX from April 5, 1999 to March 31, 2000), and later on PAX from April 3, 2000 to May 23, 2003, with reruns airing until March 26, 2004. Another version of the show aired from October 18, 2020 to January 30, 2022, also on ABC.

The 1960s &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; was broadcast from Food Fair supermarkets, mostly around New York City. For the Lifetime version, a mock supermarket was created at Hollywood Center Studios. It was modeled after a Hughes Family Market (which was later merged into the Ralphs chain in 1998). The PAX version was taped at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, California. Beginning on November 20, 2000, the show moved to NBC Studios, with that series&#x27; set modeled after a Unified Western Market. The 2020 version was filmed at the Barker Hangar at Santa Monica Airport.

The host for the 1960s version was Bill Malone. The announcers were Wally King from 1965 to 1966 and Richard Hayes from 1966 to 1967. The host for the Lifetime and PAX versions was David Ruprecht. The announcer was Johnny Gilbert from 1990 to 1995 and again from April to June 2000, with Randy West taking over for Gilbert in July 2000 and continuing for the rest of the series. The 2020 version was hosted by Leslie Jones and announced by Tahir Moore.

==Gameplay==
===1965–67===
Three teams competed. Each team began with a base time of 1 minute and 30 seconds. In the first round of the game, one contestant from each team was shown a grocery item and asked to guess its retail price. The team who came the closest won the item and an additional 15 seconds were added to their time. Four items were shown.

In the second round of the game, the contestant from each team who did not play the first round went on a shopping spree through the market, using the time accumulated. Bonus items worth $10 to $100 were also spread throughout the store. All teams kept every item they picked up, with the team with the highest total in groceries, bonus prizes and other items winning the right to return to the show and play in the next game. Teams remained on the show until they were defeated or until they reached the winnings cap of $20,000.

===1990–2003, 2020–22===
The gameplay of the Lifetime/PAX version of &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; consisted of three segments: the question round, the Big Sweep, and the Bonus Sweep. The game was played between three teams of two related individuals, such as a parent and child, spouses, siblings, or best friends, initially called to play by an object they were holding. Three new pairs of contestants appeared in each episode. Some contestants on earlier episodes later appeared in various tournaments.

The 2020 format largely mirrored the format from 1990. Each hour-long episode consisted of two complete games, with three new teams per game.

==== Question rounds ====

Similar to the original version, all three teams started with a base time of one minute and 30 seconds. In 2020, the base time was increased to two minutes. Through a series of three rounds, contestants were asked a series of questions, usually centered around knowledge of products found in a grocery store. Each correct answer added 10 seconds to a team&#x27;s time bank. The first two question rounds were played by one team member, with team members swapping positions after the first round. Questions included identifying a product that was missing letters, determining the brand of a product via an edited picture, and identifying a product based on a series of facts. Occasionally, questions centered around pop culture, movies, or stories found in checkstand tabloids.

Other questions centered around identifying the price of an item. This was accomplished in several different ways; two popular methods included determining which item in a set of three did not fit the designated criteria (e.g. +/- $3), or which item was incorrectly priced. A mainstay in the second round gave contestants the opportunity to add 30 seconds to their time banks if all three contestants gave the correct answer.

Occasionally, the second question round was replaced with one of the following games:

* &quot;30-Second Shootout&quot;Each team played this round individually. One member was given a list of words and had 30 seconds to get their partner to say as many of them as possible. The first letters of these words spelled out a brand or product name; if the partner could guess it, the team received 30 seconds of Sweep time. If the clue-giver said one of the target words, the team forfeited their turn. A variant of this game required one member to describe three particular brand names for their partner to guess (with their logos shown on-screen), with 10 seconds awarded for each correct solution.
* &quot;Snack Attack Movie Game&quot;Three questions about movies worth 10 seconds each were asked. The contestant who answered the last of the three questions correctly earned the right to take a taste test of a food item in the market, correctly identifying the item earned that team a $50 bonus for the Big Sweep. If the contestant guessed right on a second chance (multiple choice at that point, and consisting of a maximum three choices), that team earned $25. On some episodes, the question related to the item only had two choices and only the correct choice earned the $50 bonus.

The final round was the &quot;Round Robin&quot; game, in which the members of each team alternated turns buzzing in to answer questions (typically six altogether) that awarded 10 seconds apiece. For the Lifetime and PAX versions, the most common format featured a brand or product name that had its letters scrambled. The emcee would then offer a maximum of three clues to help contestants zero in on the correct answer. On some episodes of the Lifetime version, an alternate format was used that omitted the word scramble; instead, the host would offer five clues. The 2020 version used the same pool of mini-games for the Round Robin as the previous two rounds.

=====Mini-Sweep=====
Beginning in 1991, a Mini-Sweep was played at the beginning of the first round. A toss-up question (usually a rhyming couplet) was asked with a particular product as the answer. The team that correctly answered the question earned 10 seconds, as well as a chance for one team member to run into the market to retrieve a package of that product marked with the show&#x27;s logo. If the product was returned within 30 seconds, the team won $50 towards their Sweep total. The team won no bonus if the runner failed to find the marked package, returned it after time ran out, or returned an incorrect item or unmarked package. Originally, contestants were only required to bring back any one package of the item in question.

In 1992, the bonus was doubled to $100 if the product was brought back within 20 seconds. In 1993, a second Mini-Sweep was added at the beginning of the second round. This was later discontinued as a regular feature but occasionally was used during special weeks on the PAX version.

In the 2020 version, the Mini-Sweep consisted of a clue read to all three teams. Instead of buzzing-in, the teams discussed the clue and each sent one member into the market to find the correct item. The first person to bring it back won $250 and 10 seconds for their team.

====Big Sweep====
The &quot;Big Sweep&quot; was the chance for the teams to run throughout the supermarket and take products from the shelves with the seconds they had earned in the front game. One contestant from each team was designated as the &quot;runner,&quot; with the job of collecting items in a shopping cart, and the teams were assigned numbers based on their accumulated time: 1 for the most, 2 for the second-most, 3 for the least.

The clock for the Big Sweep was set to the leading team&#x27;s time, and it started when Team 1 was sent into the market. Teams 2 and 3 were sent in when the clock displayed their respective times. If any of the teams were tied, they were sent into the market at the same time.

A camera operator would follow each shopper throughout the Big Sweep. In each finished episode, the footage was spliced together to create one near-real-time highlight reel, and the announcer would add a play-by-play commentary to the reel, describing the items being placed in each contestant&#x27;s cart.

At any time, runners could bring full carts back to their partners&#x27; checkout counters and exchange them for empty ones. With the exception of certain bonuses, items had to be in a team&#x27;s cart (either the runner&#x27;s current one, or a full one already delivered to the checkout) when time ran out in order to count toward their total.

The three main rules for the Big Sweep were:
* Each runner could take no more than five of any one item.
* If an item was knocked off a shelf or otherwise upset or damaged, the runner who did so either had to replace the item on the shelf, put it in their cart, or take a $25 penalty for each item. Teams were also penalized $100 for running into supermarket displays, cameramen or any other personnel, including opponents.
* Only the runners could be in the market; their partners were required to remain at the checkout counter behind a red restraining line and unload the groceries. The partners could cross the line only with permission from the producers, typically to pick up a dropped item or bonus or to take part in a bonus activity that required their participation.

The five-item limit was absent in the original ABC version of the show, but was added to prevent a team from overloading their carts with expensive items, such as poultry, laundry detergent or over-the-counter drugs.

During most episodes of the first season, costumed characters such as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, a gorilla, or a creature named Mr. Yuck ran through the aisles during the Sweep. If the character came near a contestant or vice versa, the contestant had to turn around and go in the other direction. If the contestant&#x27;s cart hit the character, a penalty was also imposed. The characters were later dropped.

A variety of opportunities to earn additional cash were available during the Big Sweep. The one constant throughout the entire run of the second series was a group of giant &quot;bonus&quot; items (these included stuffed animals, advertising signs and inflatable displays of products) placed throughout the market in plain sight. Attached to each of these items was a peel-off sticker that concealed a value of either $50, $100 or $200. In 1993, a fourth bonus value ($250, dubbed the &quot;Super Bonus&quot;) was added. Episodes of the Twin Car Giveaway tournament that took place in 1994 had a $300 bonus (dubbed the &quot;Super Super Bonus&quot;), replacing the $50 bonus. Each runner could take only one bonus, and its value was added to the team&#x27;s total only if it was returned to the checkout counter before time ran out. The 2020 run added a &quot;triple bonus&quot; consisting of three tags worth $100, $200, and $300; the team that claimed the triple bonus had to select which tag they wanted to reveal after the Sweep ended.

Later in the Lifetime series, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; began employing more ways for the teams to build up their sweep totals. The first such method employed was called the Shopping List, where teams could earn an extra $250 for bringing three (originally four) specific grocery items back during the course of the Big Sweep ($500 in the 2020 version). Over the years, more variations on that theme would be used; for instance, the teams might be asked to fulfill a bread order or retrieve magazines.

Other ways for teams to earn money included:
:*Searching through a bin of canned goods to find a marked can of a specific brand, or a cart of random products to find a red-tagged product, announced by Ruprecht during the Big Sweep
:*Finding a mystery product or movie, with the help of clues given by Ruprecht or a set of monitors in the aisles
:*Retrieving a sack of empty cans for the partner to stack or crush
:*Grinding a bag of coffee beans
:*Weighing and bagging $1 worth of self-serve candy, as shown on a digital scale, with a 2-cent margin of error
:*Making a sandwich using every ingredient on a table
:*Finding a token by popping balloons or emptying bags of popcorn
:*Finding a cash envelope next to a specific product or attached to the back of a movie in the market, with the help of a clue announced by Ruprecht during the Big Sweep

The following bonuses were introduced in the 2020 version:
:*Requesting an item from a staff member or placing an order, then waiting for it to be delivered or prepared
:*Finding a &quot;golden can&quot; in a specified aisle announced on the loudspeaker
:*Finding a cup tagged with the contestant&#x27;s name at the in-store coffee bar
:*A &quot;Triple Bonus&quot; item with three stickers concealing values of $100, $200, and $300; a team claiming this item may peel off one sticker at the end of the Big Sweep and receive its value

Teams received money for these tasks only if they were completed in the manner specified by the host before time ran out.

Once time expired, the runners had to stop whatever they were doing and return to the checkout counters. All of the products were scanned while the show took a final commercial break, and the grand totals of each team&#x27;s takes were revealed when the show returned, beginning with Team 3, and ending with Team 1. Each team&#x27;s groceries were tallied and any bonuses/penalties were applied to determine the final totals. The team with the highest score won their Big Sweep total in cash and advanced to the Bonus Sweep for a chance to win an additional $5,000. The other teams received parting gifts. Sweep totals included cents in the first season, but were subsequently rounded to the nearest dollar, with cents only used to break ties.

====Bonus Sweep / Super Sweep====
During Ruprecht&#x27;s tenure as host, the bonus round was called the &quot;Bonus Sweep.&quot; The winning team had 60 seconds to win $5,000 by finding three particular items in succession. Ruprecht read a clue to lead the team to the identity of the first item, and the clock started immediately afterward as the team ran into the market. The correct item was tagged with a large circular token bearing the show&#x27;s logo and a clue for a second item to be found. This item in turn had a clue for a third item, which had a bundle of $5,000 in cash hidden behind it. In order to win, the team had to find all three items and have their hands on the money before time ran out. If they fell short, they received $200 for each item they had found.

Originally, if the team found the final product and the $5,000 before either of the other two, they automatically forfeited the bonus round. However, starting in 1991, this was changed so that an overhead announcement was made reminding the team to find the first two products, then return to the third product and claim the cash. On at least one episode when the overhead announcement was made, the team still found the final product before finding the second item and the team only received credit for the first item.

The first prize other than $5,000 offered on the show was a trip to Paris, given out as part of &quot;Gourmet Week&quot; in 1992. During the Twin Car Giveaway Tournament, rather than $5,000, the prize, as indicated by the tournament&#x27;s name, was a pair of Geo Tracker mini SUVs worth over $25,000. During the PAX run, cruises would occasionally be awarded. Bonus rounds were not played in those shows, rather, the players&#x27; totals would be collected for the first three weeks of the tournament, and during the fourth week, the three teams with the highest amount would compete again, and at the end of the fourth week, the team with the highest total at the end of that show would win the prize offered as well as all of the cash they had amassed during their time on the show.

The bonus round was retitled the &quot;Super Sweep&quot; in 2020. The initial rules and time limit were the same as for the Bonus Sweep, but the prize for finding all three items was $25,000. Instead of a bundle of cash, the third item had a sealed envelope hidden behind it. The team had to decide whether to &quot;cash out,&quot; ending the round and keeping the $25,000, or trade it for an additional 20 seconds on the clock to find a fourth item worth $50,000 and tagged with another envelope. If successful, they could either cash out or trade the money for another 15 seconds to find a fifth and final item, worth $100,000 and tagged with an oversized gold bill in that amount. If the team chose to continue the round after finding the third or fourth item, the clock restarted as soon as they opened the envelope containing the next clue. If time ran out at any point, the team won nothing beyond their Big Sweep total.

From 2021 to 2022, the team was given 90 seconds to find five items, each of which increased their Bonus Sweep winnings if found ($5,000, $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, and $100,000). If time ran out, the team won the money for the last item found in addition to their Big Sweep total.

==Revival==
On October 13, 2017, it was announced that Fremantle had acquired the global rights to the format and that a new version of the show was in the works. Fremantle stated that the new incarnation of the show would incorporate &quot;modern technology&quot; into the program to reflect 21st-century shopping habits. On August 27, 2019, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Leslie Jones had signed on as host and executive producer. Several networks, including ABC, NBC, and Fox, as well as Netflix, were said to be interested in acquiring the series. On January 8, 2020, &quot;Deadline&quot; confirmed that ABC had picked up the series, with Jones as host. On June 17, 2020, it was announced that the series would premiere on October 18, 2020, and air on Sundays at 8:00p.m. On May 13, 2021, the series was renewed for a second season, which premiered on September 26, 2021. In May 2022, ABC shelved the series indefinitely.

==Episode status==
Currently, episodes from the Lifetime and PAX versions air on Buzzr. In addition, a 24-hour channel, featuring various episodes from the Lifetime revival and PAX revival, is available on free ad-supported streaming television services such as The Roku Channel and Pluto TV.

==Merchandise==
A board game based on the original ABC version was manufactured by Milton Bradley in 1966. Another board game, based on the 2020 version, was manufactured by Imagination Gaming. A video slot machine was released in 2005 by WMS Gaming.

<text>Viken (Old Norse: Vík or Víkin), or Vika, was the historical name during the Viking Age and the High Middle Ages for an area of Scandinavia that originally surrounded the Oslofjord and included the coast of Bohuslän. Its definition changed over time, and from the Middle Ages, Viken included only Bohuslän.

During the Viking Age, Viken was defined as the strait running between Norway and the northwest coast of Sweden and the Jutland peninsula of Denmark. It is located in what is now southeastern Norway and the northwestern Swedish province of Bohuslän. During the Viking Age, Viken was the northernmost Danish province. Control over Viken shifted between Danish and Norwegian kings in the Middle Ages, and Denmark continued to claim Viken until 1241.

&quot;Viken&quot; was also controversially chosen as a neologistic name for the administrative region consisting of a merger of the counties of Akershus, Buskerud, and Østfold.

==History==
The cultural hub is centred in Oslo, but the capital of the region was formerly at Borre. This area included the important cities of Tønsberg, Oslo, Sarpsborg and Konghelle. There is disagreement among modern historians as to where the boundaries of the geographical area called Viken were during the Viking era. It is commonly believed to have comprised the historical provinces of Vestfold, Ranrike, Vingulmark, Grenland and Båhuslen.

Historically the Danish kings had established dominion over the area. Norwegian royal power began to assert itself in Viken with King Olav Haraldsson, mostly due to a sharp weakening of the Danish royal power. Olaf first declared himself king of Norway in 1015 and established control of the nation in battle, principally the Battle of Nesjar in 1016. King Olav subsequently founded the city of Sarpsborg in Viken during 1016.

During the Civil war era in Norway, the Bagler faction frequently established themselves in the Viken area. The wealthier classes, particularly in Viken, were the basis of the Bagler party. The Norwegian kings achieved full authority with developments which reached its peak when the national capital was established at Oslo during the reign of King Haakon V of Norway in 1314.

==Etymology==
Viken is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;vík&quot;, meaning an inlet or creek (UK). The English cognate is the &quot;-wich&quot; in many placenames (cf. Sandwich). The modern Norwegian form &quot;Vika&quot; is derived from the definite form, &quot;Víkin&quot; (O.N. -in &gt; M.Norw. -ĩ &gt; Norw. -a), whilst the form &quot;Viken&quot; is derived partially from its Danish cognate, &quot;Vigen&quot; (Norwegianized to &quot;Viken&quot; in Riksmål), and partially from the local dative case name, &quot;Viken&quot; (pronounced in tone 2).

Various theories have been offered that the word &quot;viking&quot; may be derived from this place name, meaning &quot;a person from Viken&quot;. According to this theory, originally the word &quot;viking&quot; simply described persons from this area, and that it is only in the last few centuries that it has taken on the broader sense of early medieval Scandinavians in general.

<text>UnixWare is a Unix operating system. It was originally released by Univel, a jointly owned venture of AT&amp;T&#x27;s Unix System Laboratories (USL) and Novell. It was then taken over by Novell. Via Santa Cruz Operation (SCO), it went on to Caldera Systems, Caldera International, and The SCO Group before it was sold to UnXis (now Xinuos). UnixWare is typically deployed as a server rather than a desktop. Binary distributions of UnixWare are available for x86 architecture computers. UnixWare is primarily marketed as a server operating system.

== History ==

=== Univel (1991–1993) ===

After the SVR4 effort to merge SunOS and System V, AT&amp;T&#x27;s Unix System Laboratories (USL) formed the Univel partnership with Novell to develop a desktop version of Unix for i386 and i486 machines, codenamed &quot;Destiny&quot;.

Destiny is based on the Unix System V release 4.2 kernel. The MoOLIT toolkit is used for the windowing system, allowing the user to choose between an OPEN LOOK or MOTIF-like look and feel at runtime. In order to make the system more robust on commodity desktop hardware, the Veritas VXFS journaling file system is used in place of the UFS file system used in SVR4. Networking support in UnixWare includes both TCP/IP and interoperability with Novell&#x27;s NetWare protocols (IPX/SPX); the former were the standard among Unix users at the time of development, while PC networking was much more commonly based on NetWare.

Destiny was released in 1992 as UnixWare 1.0, with the intention of unifying the fragmented PC Unix market behind this single variant of the operating system. The system was earlier to reach the corporate computing market than Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT, but observers of the period remarked that UnixWare was &quot;just another flavor of Unix&quot;, Novell&#x27;s involvement being more a marketing ploy than a significant influx of technology. There two editions of Destiny: a &quot;Personal Edition&quot;, which includes Novell IPX networking but not TCP/IP, and an &quot;Advanced Server&quot; Edition with TCP/IP and other server software. The personal edition is limited to two active users, while the server edition includes an unlimited user license. Around 35,000 copies of UnixWare 1.0 were sold.

In 1992, UnixWare 1.0 Personal Edition came with DOS Merge 3.0 and Novell&#x27;s DR DOS 6.0.

In 1993, Novell purchased USL from AT&amp;T and merged USL and Univel into a new Unix Systems Group.

=== Novell (1993–1995) ===
In 1994 Novell released UnixWare 1.1, which includes TCP/IP in both the personal and advanced server editions.
The MOTIF 1.2 runtime libraries are included for COSE compliance. NUC (NetWare Unix Client) software is included for integration with Novell NetWare servers. The Advanced Merge application is installed on both the server and personal editions to allow running DOS and Windows 3.1 applications.

Novell later released bug-fix versions 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3 and finally 1.1.4 on 19 June 1995.

UnixWare 2.0, based on the Unix System V release 4.2MP kernel, which added support for multiprocessing, began shipping to OEMs and developers in December 1994, and to the consumer market in March 1995. Both the personal and server editions support two processor systems, with the possibility of buying extra Processor Upgrade licenses for the server edition. Supported multiprocessor systems include standard Intel MP 1.1 SMP machines and Corollary C-bus systems. The system supports NetWare ODI network drivers in an effort to increase the number of supported network interfaces. Other new features in the release include a POSIX Threads library in addition to the older UI threads library.

Before SCO licensed UnixWare in 1995, Novell had also announced a project to create a &quot;SuperNOS&quot; based on NetWare 4.1 and UnixWare 2.0 technologies in the future. This never materialized. Instead, a NetWare 4.10 server on Linux was offered as Caldera NetWare for Linux for OpenLinux since 1998, and Novell&#x27;s Open Enterprise Server finally came in 2005.

=== Santa Cruz Operation (1995–2001) ===

In 1995, the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) acquired UnixWare from Novell. The exact terms of this transaction were disputed (see SCO vs Novell); courts have subsequently determined that Novell retained the ownership of Unix.

When the transfer was made public SCO announced that it would work towards merging UnixWare with its OpenServer SVR3.2 based OS, but the first release of UnixWare from SCO was version 2.1 in 1996. At the release of UnixWare 2.1 it was announced that the proposed UnixWare/OpenServer merger was known as project Gemini, to be available in 1997 and a 64-bit version of UnixWare was to be developed for 1998.

One controversial change was the adoption of an OpenServer-like user licensing policy. The Univel and Novell releases of UnixWare allow 2 users on the personal edition or unlimited numbers of users on the server edition. With UnixWare 2.1 the server edition includes a license for up to 5 users. Customers wanting more users could purchase 10, 25, 100, 500 or unlimited user license extensions.

SCO released three updates to UnixWare 2.1. UnixWare 2.1.1, released in 1996 achieved Unix 95 branding. UnixWare 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, available in 1998, are largely bug fix releases.

In 1998 Compaq released a package known as the Integrity XC consisting of a single-system image cluster of Proliant servers with a version of UnixWare 2.1, UnixWare NonStop Clusters.

The first results of the Gemini project were made available in early 1998 as UnixWare 7. SCO named the kernel version Unix System V release 5. The system is largely based on UnixWare 2.1, with features for driver compatibility with OpenServer, allowing use of OpenServer network drivers. System administration utilities from OpenServer, scoadmin, replace the original UnixWare sysadm utility. Major new features of UnixWare 7 include multi-path I/O, large files and file systems and support for large memory systems.

UnixWare 7 lacks the Xenix compatibility features of both its ancestors.

In 1999 SCO released the UnixWare 7.1 update which increased the number of editions; the Business (5-user), Department (25 user) and Enterprise (50 user) editions replace the earlier personal and server editions. The WebTop application from Tarantella, Inc. is included.

In 2000 SCO released the UnixWare 7.1.1 update. Simultaneously the UnixWare NonStop Clusters 7.1.1+IP single-system image cluster package was released. This new package allows commodity hardware to be used as well as the proprietary Compaq hardware supported by the earlier Integrity XC product, and was directly available from SCO.

=== Caldera Systems, Caldera International and The SCO Group (2000–2011) ===

On 2 August 2000, Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) announced that it would sell its Server Software and Services Divisions, as well as rights to the OpenServer and UnixWare products, to Caldera Systems. In March 2001, Caldera Systems became Caldera International (CII), and the SCO purchase was completed in May 2001. The remaining part of the Santa Cruz Operation company, the Tarantella Division, changed its name to Tarantella, Inc.

Caldera International&#x27;s initial release of UnixWare was renamed OpenUNIX 8. This release is what would have been UnixWare 7.1.2.

Caldera International renamed itself to The SCO Group in August 2002, after broadening its product line to include mobile products and services.

Later, the newly renamed The SCO Group reverted to the previous UnixWare brand and version release numbering, releasing UnixWare 7.1.3 and 7.1.4. No further OpenUNIX releases were made available and OpenUNIX 8.1.2 (OU812) was never released. The SCO Group continued to maintain UnixWare and issues periodic maintenance updates and support.

Between 2007 and 2011, The SCO Group engaged in a series of legal battles. In September 2007, The SCO Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

On 11 April 2011, UnXis bought The SCO Group operating assets and intellectual property rights after having been approved by the bankruptcy court in Delaware.

The SCO Group, Inc. then renamed itself TSG Group, Inc., and SCO Operations, Inc. became TSG Operations, Inc., and in August 2012 filed to convert from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7.

===UnXis and Xinuos (2011–present)===
The rights to Unixware, as well as OpenServer, were acquired by UnXis in 2011.

In June 2013 UnXis was renamed as Xinuos and announced product and availability for SCO UnixWare 7.1.4+, now supporting both physical and virtual machines.

== Version history ==
== SCO Skunkware and open source ==
All versions of UnixWare have included significant open source components including BIND/X11/Sendmail/DHCP/Perl/Tcl and others. Later releases are bundled with numerous additional open source applications including Apache, Samba, MySQL, PostgreSQL, OpenSSH, and Mozilla software, as well as amenities such as Sudo, Vim, Tar, Gzip, and Red Hat&#x27;s RPM Package Manager

All versions of SCO operating system distributions including UnixWare also have an extensive set of open source packages available for free download via the SCO Skunkware site.

<text>In electrochemistry, standard electrode potential formula_1, or formula_2, is a measure of the reducing power of any element or compound. The IUPAC &quot;Gold Book&quot; defines it as; &quot;the value of the standard emf (electromotive force) of a cell in which molecular hydrogen under standard pressure is oxidized to solvated protons at the left-hand electrode&quot;.

==Background==
The basis for an electrochemical cell, such as the galvanic cell, is always a redox reaction which can be broken down into two half-reactions: oxidation at anode (loss of electron) and reduction at cathode (gain of electron). Electricity is produced due to the difference of electric potential between the individual potentials of the two metal electrodes with respect to the electrolyte. 

Although the overall potential of a cell can be measured, there is no simple way to accurately measure the electrode/electrolyte potentials in isolation. The electric potential also varies with temperature, concentration and pressure. Since the oxidation potential of a half-reaction is the negative of the reduction potential in a redox reaction, it is sufficient to calculate either one of the potentials. Therefore, standard electrode potential is commonly written as standard reduction potential.

== Calculation ==
The galvanic cell potential results from the voltage difference of a &quot;pair&quot; of electrodes. It is not possible to measure an absolute value for each electrode separately. However, the potential of a reference electrode, standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), is defined as to 0.00 V. An electrode with unknown electrode potential can be paired with either the standard hydrogen electrode, or another electrode whose potential has already been measured, to determine its &quot;absolute&quot; potential.

Since the electrode potentials are conventionally defined as reduction potentials, the sign of the potential for the metal electrode being oxidized must be reversed when calculating the overall cell potential. The electrode potentials are independent of the number of electrons transferred —they are expressed in volts, which measure energy per electron transferred—and so the two electrode potentials can be simply combined to give the overall &quot;cell&quot; potential even if different numbers of electrons are involved in the two electrode reactions.

For practical measurements, the electrode in question is connected to the positive terminal of the electrometer, while the standard hydrogen electrode is connected to the negative terminal.

== Reversible electrode ==

A reversible electrode is an electrode that owes its potential to changes of a reversible nature. A first condition to be fulfilled is that the system is close to the chemical equilibrium. A second set of conditions is that the system is submitted to very small solicitations spread on a sufficient period of time so, that the chemical equilibrium conditions nearly always prevail. In theory, it is very difficult to experimentally achieve reversible conditions because any perturbation imposed to a system near equilibrium in a finite time forces it out of equilibrium. However, if the solicitations exerted on the system are sufficiently small and applied slowly, one can consider an electrode to be reversible. By nature, electrode reversibility depends on the experimental conditions and the way the electrode is operated. For example, electrodes used in electroplating are operated with a high over-potential to force the reduction of a given metal cation to be deposited onto a metallic surface to be protected. Such a system is far from equilibrium and continuously submitted to important and constant changes in a short period of time

== Standard reduction potential table ==

The larger the value of the standard reduction potential, the easier it is for the element to be reduced (gain electrons); in other words, they are better oxidizing agents. 

For example, F2 has a standard reduction potential of +2.87 V and Li+ has −3.05 V: 

: (&quot;g&quot;) + 2 2 = +2.87 V
: + (&quot;s&quot;) = −3.05 V

The highly positive standard reduction potential of F2 means it is reduced easily and is therefore a good oxidizing agent. In contrast, the greatly negative standard reduction potential of Li+ indicates that it is not easily reduced. Instead, Li(&quot;s&quot;) would rather undergo oxidation (hence it is a good reducing agent). 

Zn2+ has a standard reduction potential of −0.76 V and thus can be oxidized by any other electrode whose standard reduction potential is greater than −0.76 V (e.g., H+ (0 V), Cu2+ (0.34 V), F2 (2.87 V)) and can be reduced by any electrode with standard reduction potential less than −0.76 V (e.g. H2 (−2.23 V), Na+ (−2.71 V), Li+ (−3.05 V)).

In a galvanic cell, where a spontaneous redox reaction drives the cell to produce an electric potential, Gibbs free energy formula_3 must be negative, in accordance with the following equation:

: formula_4      (unit: Joule = Coulomb × Volt)

where is number of moles of electrons per mole of products and is the Faraday constant, . 

As such, the following rules apply:

: If formula_5 &gt; 0, then the process is spontaneous (galvanic cell): formula_6 &lt; 0, and energy is liberated.

: If formula_5 &lt; 0, then the process is non-spontaneous (electrolytic cell): formula_6 &gt; 0, and energy is consumed.

Thus in order to have a spontaneous reaction (formula_6 &lt; 0), formula_5must be positive, where:

: formula_11

where formula_12 is the standard potential at the cathode (called as standard cathodic potential or standard reduction potential and formula_13 is the standard potential at the anode (called as standard anodic potential or standard oxidation potential) as given in the table of standard electrode potential.

<text>Sanofi S.A. is a French multinational pharmaceutical and healthcare company headquartered in Paris, France. The corporation was established in 1973 and merged with Synthélabo in 1999 to form Sanofi-Synthélabo. In 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo merged with Aventis and renamed to Sanofi-Aventis, which were each the product of several previous mergers. It changed its name back to Sanofi in May 2011. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. In 2023, the company’s seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 89.

Sanofi engages in the research and development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmacological products, principally in the prescription market, but the firm also develops over-the-counter medications. The corporation covers seven major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular, central nervous system, diabetes, internal medicine, oncology, thrombosis, and vaccines. It is the world&#x27;s largest producer of vaccines through its subsidiary Sanofi Pasteur.

==History==
===Sanofi-Synthélabo===
Sanofi was founded in 15 February 1973 as a subsidiary of Elf Aquitaine (a French oil company subsequently acquired by Total), when Elf Aquitaine took control of the Labaz group, a pharmaceutical company formed in 1947 by Sociéte Belge de l&#x27;Azote et des Produits Chimiques du Marly; Labaz developed benziodarone in 1957. In 1993, Sanofi made a move into the Eastern Europe market by acquiring a controlling interest in Chinoin, a Hungarian drug company whose 1992, sales totaled about US$104 million. In the same year, Sanofi made its first significant venture into the US, and strengthened its presence in Eastern Europe, by first partnering with Sterling Winthrop and then acquiring the prescription pharmaceuticals business in 1994. Sanofi was incorporated under the laws of France in 1994, as a &quot;société anonyme&quot;, a form of limited liability company.

Synthélabo was founded in 1970, through the merger of two French pharmaceutical laboratories, Laboratoires Dausse (founded in 1834)б and Laboratoires Robert &amp; Carrière (founded in 1899). In 1973, the French cosmetics group L&#x27;Oréal acquired the majority of its share capital. In 1991, Synthelabo acquired Laboratories Delalande and Laboratoires Delagrange, and through this deal picked up the product metoclopramide.
Sanofi-Synthélabo was formed in 1999 when Sanofi merged with Synthélabo; at the time of the merger, Sanofi was the second largest pharmaceutical group in France in terms of sales and Synthélabo was the third largest. The merged company was based in Paris, France.

The merged companies focused on pharmaceuticals, divesting several businesses soon after the merger, including beauty, diagnostics, animal health and nutrition, custom chemicals, and two medical equipment businesses.

===Aventis===
Aventis was formed in 1999, when the French company Rhône-Poulenc S.A. merged with the German corporation Hoechst Marion Roussel, which itself was formed from the 1995 merger of Hoechst AG with Cassella, Roussel Uclaf, and Marion Merrell Dow. Hoechst AG, the majority partner at the time in Hoechst Marion Roussel, was itself a merger of two of the three forcibly separated subsidiaries of IG Farben, exploiter of Auschwitz slave labor and supplier of Zyklon B during The Holocaust. The merged company was based in Schiltigheim, near Strasbourg, France.

At the time of the merger, Rhône-Poulenc&#x27;s business included the pharmaceutical businesses Rorer, Centeon (blood products), and Pasteur Merieux (vaccines), the plant and animal health businesses Rhône-Poulenc Agro, Rhône-Poulenc Animal Nutrition, and Merial, and a 67 percent share in Rhodia, a speciality chemicals company. Hoechst, one of the companies that resulted from the post-WWII split of IG Farben, had seven primary businesses: Hoechst Marion Roussel (pharmaceuticals), AgrEvo (a joint venture with Schering in crop protection agents and pest control products), HR Vet (veterinary products), Dade Behring (diagnostics), Centeon, Celanese (chemicals), and Messer (chemicals). Merieux has been in the business of selling blood products, and in the 1980s, during the AIDS epidemic, Merieux and other companies were involved in scandals related to HIV-contaminated haemophilia blood products that were sold to developing nations.

In 2000, Aventis and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a US biotechnology company formed to discover new drugs based on the then-new science of genomics, announced that Aventis would make a $250M investment in Millennium and would pay $200M to Millennium in research fees over five years, one of the largest such deals between a big pharmaceutical company and a biotech company at the time.

In late 2000, in the midst of the recall of Starlink, its genetically modified maize product, Aventis announced that it had determined to sell off Aventis Cropscience, the seed and pesticide business unit it had created from the agriculture businesses of its predecessors. In October 2001, Bayer and Aventis announced that Bayer would acquire the unit for about $6.6 billion; the unit became Bayer CropScience, making Bayer the world&#x27;s second-largest agrochemical company behind Syngenta.

In 2003, Aventis entered into a collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, a New York biotechnology company, to develop Regeneron&#x27;s VEGF-inhibiting drug, aflibercept, which was then in Phase I clinical trials. Aventis invested $45 million in Regeneron and made an upfront payment of $80 million in cash. Regeneron partnered the use of the drug with Bayer Healthcare in the field of proliferative eye diseases, and under the name Eylea it was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011; after several setbacks in clinical trials, Regeneron and Sanofi got the drug approved for metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with other agents, under the brand name Zaltrap in 2012.

====Sanofi-Aventis merger====
Sanofi-Aventis was formed in 2004, when Sanofi-Synthélabo acquired Aventis. In early 2004, Sanofi-Synthélabo made a hostile takeover bid for Aventis worth €47.8 billion. Initially, Aventis rejected the bid because it felt that the bid offered inferior value based on the company&#x27;s share value, and the board of Aventis went so far as to enact poison pill provisions and to invite Novartis to enter merger negotiations. The three-month takeover battle concluded when Sanofi-Synthélabo launched a friendly bid of €54.5 billion in place of the previously rejected hostile bid. The French government played a strong role, desiring what it called a &quot;local solution&quot;, by putting heavy pressure on Sanofi-Synthélabo to raise its bid for Aventis and for Aventis to accept the offer and by rejecting Aventis&#x27;s poison pill proposal. One of the largest risks in the deal for both sides was the fate of the patents protecting Clopidogrel (Plavix), which was one of the top-selling drugs in the world at the time and the major source of Sanofi&#x27;s revenue.

===Post-merger activities===
In 2006, Iraqis infected with HIV sued Sanofi and Baxter over HIV-contaminated haemophilia blood products sold by Merieux in the 1980s. In 2006, the US patents on clopidogrel (Plavix) were challenged when a Canadian generics company, Apotex, filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application under the Hatch-Waxman Act, received FDA approval, and started marketing a generic formulation of clopidogrel. While Sanofi-Aventis and its partner in the drug, Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS), were able to get an injunction to stop Apotex from selling it, the case became complicated when settlement negotiations fell apart twice – the second time because of an oral agreement made by BMS CEO Peter Dolan that BMS failed to disclose to the Federal Trade Commission during the review of the settlement agreement to ensure that it did not violate antitrust law. When Apotex disclosed the oral agreement to the FTC, the FTC launched an investigation that led to Dolan&#x27;s dismissal by BMS. Apotex finally lost on the patent litigation issues after its third appeal was decided in favor of BMS/Sanofi in November 2011; Apotex had to pay ~$442 million in damages and ~$108 million in interest for infringing the patent, which it paid in full by February 2012. Apotex also sued BMS and Sanofi for $3.4 billion for allegedly breaching the settlement agreement; Apotex lost a jury trial in March 2013.

In 2007, Sanofi-Aventis expanded on Aventis&#x27;s prior relationship with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; in the new deal Sanofi-Aventis agreed to pay Regeneron $100 million per year for five years, under which Regeneron would use its monoclonal antibody discovery platform to create new biopharmaceuticals, to which Sanofi-Aventis gained the exclusive right to co-develop. In 2009, the companies expanded the deal to $160 million per year and extended it to 2017. , the collaboration had four antibodies in clinical development and had filed an IND for a fifth. Two were against undisclosed targets, one targeted the interleukin-6 receptor as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, another targeted nerve growth factor for the treatment of pain, and another targeted delta-like ligand 4 as a cancer treatment.

Between 2008, when Chris Viehbacher was hired as CEO, and 2010, the company spent more than $17 billion in mergers and acquisitions to strengthen its consumer healthcare and generics platforms, especially in emerging markets, in the face of looming patent cliffs and the growth of the consumer healthcare segment. In September, Zentiva was acquired for €1.8 billion, expanding the group&#x27;s presence in eastern European markets.

In 2009, Medley Farma, the third largest pharmaceutical company in Brazil and a leading generics company there, was acquired for about $635 million. Sanofi outbid Teva Pharmaceuticals. The deal was approved by Brazil&#x27;s antitrust authorities in May 2010. Later that year, Indian vaccine manufacturer Shantha Biotechnics was acquired for $784 million. In October Sanofi-Aventis announced that it would lay off about 1700 US employees (about 25% of its US workforce) because of restructuring triggered by growing generic competition and other factors, and that the company would focus its US operations on diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and oncology.

In 2010, US consumer healthcare company Chattem, Inc. was acquired for around $1.9 billion. In the same year, Nepentes Pharma was acquired for $130 million and BMP Sunstone Corporation for $520.6 million.

===Name change, acquisitions and investments===
The company dropped the -Aventis suffix of its name on May 6, 2011, after receiving approval at its annual general meeting. The reason given by the company for the change was to make its name easier to pronounce in countries such as China.

In 2011, Genzyme Corporation was acquired for around $20.1 billion. This biotechnology company, headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, specializes in the treatment of orphan diseases, renal diseases, endocrinology, oncology, and biosurgery.

In January 2012, Sanofi co-invested in the $125 million Series A financing of Warp Drive Bio. Sanofi sought support for its internal cancer research program and also took on an obligation to acquire Warp Drive if certain milestones were met.

In January 2014, Genzyme and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a US biotechnology company developing RNAi therapeutics, announced that Genyzme would invest $700 million in Alnylam. Under the deal, Genzyme obtained further rights to patisiran, an RNAi treatment for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis – a condition that can result in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy and obtained rights to other compounds in Alnylam&#x27;s pipeline.

In March 2014, Sanofi joined the bidding for Merck &amp; Co.&#x27;s over-the-counter health-products unit, the maker of Coppertone sunblock and the antihistamine Claritin; bids were expected to range between $10 billion and $12 billion.

In October 2014, Sanofi&#x27;s directors fired US-resident chief executive Chris Viehbacher, blaming his alleged lack of communication with the board and poor execution of his strategy. Board chairperson Serge Weinberg took over as interim CEO until 2 April 2015 when Bayer Healthcare board chairman Olivier Brandicourt (appointed by Sanofi on 19 February 2015) took over. Before Brandicourt even started his new job, French government ministers Stéphane Le Foll and Ségolène Royal attacked the $4.5 million golden handshake he was getting from Sanofi – and his pay of about $4.7 million a year. Furthermore, in 2014, the business took a 66% stake in Globalpharma, a Dubai-based generics manufacturer.

In July 2015, Genzyme announced that it would acquire the cancer drug Caprelsa (vandetanib) from AstraZeneca for up to $300 million. In the same month, the company announced a new global collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to discover, develop, and commercialize new immuno-oncology drugs, which could generate more than $2 billion for Regeneron, with $640 million upfront, $750 million for proof of concept data, and $650 million from the development of REGN2810.

In June 2016, the company announced that it had struck an asset-swap deal with Boehringer Ingelheim. Sanofi would sell its Merial animal health division (valuing it at €11.4 billion), while acquiring Boehringer&#x27;s consumer health division (valuing it at €6.7 billion) and €4.7 billion in cash. The deal meant that Sanofi was now one of the global consumer healthcare leaders by market share.

In July 2017, the company announced its intention to acquire Protein Sciences, a privately held Connecticut-based vaccines biotechnology company, for $650 million and with up to $100 million in milestone achievements.

In January 2018, Sanofi announced that it would acquire Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and days later announced that it would acquire Ablynx for €3.9 billion ($4.8 billion).

In December 2019, the company announced that it would acquire Synthorx for $2.5 billion ($68 per share), adding the lead product candidate THOR-707 (SAR444245), a form of interleukin-2 (IL-2) being developed for use against multiple solid tumors. In October 2022, Sanofi announced that it had stopped Phase 2 studies of THOR-707 (SAR444245) because the drug&#x27;s efficacy “was lower than projected”. Sanofi would take a roughly $1.6 billion impairment charge because of delays to the program.

In May 2020, Regeneron announced that it would repurchase around $5 billion of its shares held directly by Sanofi. Before the transaction, Sanofi had held 23.2 million Regeneron shares. In June, the company announced that it had agreed a potential $2 billion deal with Translate Bio, expanding an already existing collaboration for COVID-19 treatments. The company agreed to produce 60 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine for the United Kingdom government in July 2020. It used recombinant protein-based technology for Sanofi&#x27;s flu vaccine along with GSK&#x27;s pandemic technology and was seeking regulatory approval by the first half of 2021. Sanofi also agreed to a $2.1 billion deal with the United States for 100 million doses. In August, Sanofi announced that it would acquire Principia Biopharma for $3.7 billion, acquiring its BTK inhibitor program. The acquisition was completed in September 2020. In November, Sanofi announced that it would acquire Kiadis Pharma for €308 million (around $359 million, or €5.45 per share), expanding its immuno-oncology pipeline with the acquisition of Kiadis&#x27;s three clinical compounds: K-NK002 in Phase II trials for hematopoietic stem cell transplants in blood cancer, K-NK003 for relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, and K-NK-ID101 for COVID-19.

In January 2021, Sanofi announced that it would buy the British biotech Kymab Ltd and its potential first-in-class drug candidate – KY1005 –- for $1.45 billion. In April, the business announced that it would acquire Tidal Therapeutics for up to $470m. in August the company announced that it would acquire Translate Bio and its mRNA vaccine technology for $3.2 billion. On 8 September 2021, Sanofi announced that it would acquire US biotech company Kadmon Corporation for $1.9 billion On 18 November 2021, it was reported that Sanofi would be investing $180 million in French startup Owkin, whose predictive algorithms aim to improve the research and development of new cures against cancer. In December, the company announced that it would acquire Origimm Biotechnology GmbH and its acne vaccine candidate (ORI-001), as well as Amunix Pharmaceuticals, for an initial $1 billion plus potentially $200 million in additional milestones.

In April 2022, Sanofi broke ground on its biggest industrial investment, a $638m vaccine and enzymes production facility in Tuas, Singapore, targeted for completion in 2025.

In March 2023, the company announced it would acquire Provention Bio and its type 1 diabetes therapy pipeline.

In the fall of 2023, Sanofi announced plans to separate the OTC and focus on its key prescription production, increasing investment and reducing costs. The most likely way to separate a non-prescription division (about 11,000 employees, 2023 revenue — over $4 billion) is to create a public company headquartered in France. The division is planned for the fourth quarter of 2024.

In December 2023, the company has signed a 140 million dollars partnership with Aqemia, a company that solves a mathematical equation that eliminates the need for heavy computing facilities with large computing power.

In January 2024, Sanofi announced that it had agreed to buy a U.S. biotech firm Inhibrx for up to $2.2 billion, with a focus on obtaining Inhibrx&#x27;s INBRX-101, an experimental treatment for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD), an inherited rare disease that causes progressive deterioration of the lung tissue.

In October 2024, Sanofi and CD&amp;R entered exclusive negotiations to transfer a 50% controlling stake in Opella with Sanofi to remain a significant shareholder.

==Products==
The following products are listed on the Sanofi Genzyme website. Generic drug names are given in parentheses following the brand name.

– Autoimmune

* Aubagio (Teriflunomide), small molecule for multiple sclerosis. Approved by the FDA in September 2012.
* Auvi-Q (Epinephrine autoinjector), licensed from Intelliject and approved by the FDA in 2012, for emergency treatment of life-threatening allergic reactions.

Product recall and effects: The epinephrine (adrenaline) auto-injection devices made by Sanofi SA currently on the market in the US and Canada were voluntarily recalled on 28 October 2015. The reason given by Sanofi was that the products had been found to potentially have inaccurate dosage delivery systems, which might include failure to deliver the drugs.

Sanofi US also added the following warning: If a patient experiencing a serious allergic reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) did not receive the intended dose, there could be significant health consequences, including death, because anaphylaxis is a potentially life‑threatening condition.

In its news release on 28 October 2015, Sanofi Canada stated that it was &quot;actively working with suppliers of alternative epinephrine auto-injectors to have a full stock available in Canada as soon as possible. Canadian customers were asked to immediately return the Allerject product to their local pharmacy to obtain an alternate epinephrine auto-injector.&quot;

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also filed a news release, confirming that the recall involved all Auvi-Q currently on the market in the United States. The FDA release went on to provide information for consumers re: exchanging the device for another brand of product, also provided on the Auvi-Q web site. Sanofi US would provide reimbursement for out of pocket costs incurred for the purchase of new, alternate epinephrine auto-injectors with proof of purchase.

The alternate products expected to most commonly replace the recalled Sanofi devices were the EpiPens made by Mylan in the US and by Pfizer—under license from Mylan—in Canada. Mylan already had an 85% market share of the auto-injectors in the USA in the first half of 2015. Maylan was expected to benefit from the recall by its competitor Sanofi, according to a report published in the Fierce Pharma newsletter of 2 November 2015. As Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal wrote in a note to clients,&quot;...it is very hard to see Auvi-Q returning to the market, as it will need to be redesigned and face uphill battle to recapture patient trust after the recall.&quot; Gal also believed that the company would eventually have 95% of the epinephrine auto-injector market, according to another Fierce Pharma report on 3 November 2015.

===Pipeline===
, Sanofi was in a race with Amgen and Pfizer to win approval for a drug that inhibits PCSK9, a protein that slows the clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol – the form of cholesterol that leads to heart attacks. Sanofi&#x27;s drug, a monoclonal antibody, was discovered by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and is called alirocumab. An FDA warning in March 2014, about possible cognitive adverse effects of PCSK9 inhibition threw the competition into disarray, as the FDA asked companies to include neurocognitive testing into their Phase III clinical trials.

In 2013, Sanofi announced that another candidate from its collaboration with Regeneron, a monoclonal antibody against the interleukin 6 receptor, sarilumab, had better efficacy than placebo in its first Phase III trial in rheumatoid arthritis.

==Head office==

In January 2012, Sanofi moved its head office location to 54, Rue La Boétie in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. This former mansion designed by architect René-Patouillard had previously been the head office of Alcatel-Lucent.

Sanofi&#x27;s previous head office was located in the 13th arrondissement of Paris, at 174 Avenue de France. The architecture of the head office is of the predominant style of the area surrounding the François Mitterrand Library. After Sanofi and Aventis merged, the employees at the former Aventis head office in Schiltigheim, Alsace, moved to Paris.

In November 2022, Sanofi moved into its new global headquarters in the 17th arrondissement of Paris, at 46-48 Avenue de la Grande Armée.

==Collaborative research==
In addition to internal research and development activities, Sanofi is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox project The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of EFPIA and the European Commission.

In June 2010, Sanofi and the Charité University of Berlin signed a cooperation agreement for the research and development of medicines and therapies.

On 25 October 2012, Sanofi said its earnings for the third quarter slumped, as generic competitors ate into profits from its Eloxatin cancer treatment.

==Sanofi Pasteur==
In 2005, Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccines division of Sanofi Group, was awarded a $97 Million United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) contract.

===BCG supply shortage 2012–2014===
In 2011, a Sanofi Pasteur plant flooded, causing it problems with mold. The facility, located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, produced BCG vaccine products, made with the Glaxo 1077 strain, such as a tuberculosis vaccine ImmuCYST, a BCG Immunotherapeutic, a bladder cancer drug. By April 2012, the FDA had found dozens of documented problems with sterility at the plant, including mold, nesting birds, and rusted electrical conduits. The plant was closed for over two years, resulting in shortages of bladder cancer and tuberculosis vaccines. On 29 October 2014 Health Canada gave Sanofi permission to resume production of BCG.

===COVID-19 vaccine===
In 2020, Sanofi, together with GSK, signed a deal with the US government&#x27;s Operation Warp Speed to provide 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine for up to US$2.1 billion, if the vaccine was approved.

As of August 2020, COVID-19 vaccine development in Sanofi underscored its fundamental competitiveness weakness, with which management has been struggling and failed to deal with for many years, beyond cutting more costs. Unfortunately, even though the approach of Sanofi-GSK is based on pre-existing, approved platforms and technology (as with Flublok flu), without reinventing the wheel of the necessary infrastructure, the company lagged behind many other rivals in delivering a working vaccine. Sanofi planned to start Phase 1 clinical testing only in September and expected emergency use approval in the first half of 2021. Competitors such as Novavax had already completed Phase 1 studies, with promising results, and Moderna-NIH had already initiated its Phase 3 trial. According to CNBC reports, as part of the $2.1 billion US government deal, more than 750 million went to supporting Sanofi-GSK in vaccine development and clinical trials. Sanofi turn-outs &quot;accelerate&quot; the development via a smaller biotech firm, Translate Bio, with a $425M partnership.

At the end of September 2021, Sanofi announced that it would stop developing its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Despite promising results, the drug would not continue to Phase 3 trials, and the company stated that it would be &#x27;too late to reach the market.&#x27;

==Associations==
Sanofi is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).

Sanofi&#x27;s vaccine subsidiary, Sanofi Pasteur, is a member of EuropaBio.

In June 2021, Sanofi partnered with Capgemini, Orange &amp; Generali to launch Future4care, an all-European start-up accelerator centered on digital health.

==Aventis Foundation==
The Aventis Foundation, a German charitable trust, was established in 1996, as the Hoechst Foundation, with an endowment of €50 million. In 2000, the foundation was renamed the Aventis Foundation. The foundation promotes cultural and scientific projects, specifically focused on the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area.

<doc id="566978" wikidata="Q541074" url="?curid=566978" title="Richard Mellon Scaife">
<text>Richard Mellon Scaife (; July 3, 1932 – July 4, 2014) was an American billionaire, a principal heir to the Mellon banking, oil, and aluminum fortune, and the owner and publisher of the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;. In 2005, Scaife was number 238 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400, with a personal fortune of $1.2 billion. By 2013, Scaife had dropped to number 371 on the listing, with a personal fortune of $1.4 billion.

During his life, Scaife was known for his financial support of conservative public policy organizations over the past four decades. He provided support for conservative and libertarian causes in the United States, mostly through the private, nonprofit foundations he controlled: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, Carthage Foundation, and Allegheny Foundation, and until 2001, the Scaife Family Foundation, now controlled by son David.

==Early life==
Scaife was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Alan Magee Scaife, the head of an affluent Pittsburgh family, and Sarah Cordelia Mellon, who was a member of the influential Mellon family, one of the most powerful families in the country. Sarah was the niece of former United States Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon. She and her brother, financier R.K. Mellon, were heirs to the Mellon fortune that included Mellon Bank and major stakes in Gulf Oil and Alcoa aluminum.

Scaife attended high school at Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts where he almost didn&#x27;t graduate after getting caught drinking off campus at the age of 14. He was expelled from Yale University in the aftermath of a drunken party in which he launched an empty beer keg down a flight of stairs, injuring a classmate. Yale gave him the opportunity to repeat his freshman year, but he continued to skip class and flunked out. With the help of his father, who was chairman of the board of trustees, he attended the University of Pittsburgh and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English in 1957.

Scaife inherited positions on several corporate boards in 1958 when his father Alan died unexpectedly. However, his family had become estranged from his uncle, R. K. Mellon, who retained control of the companies. His mother encouraged him to get involved in the family&#x27;s philanthropic foundations, and he did so. (See management of Scaife family foundations.) He inherited much of the Mellon fortune when his mother died in 1965.

A portion of the fortune was placed in trust funds and the rest in foundations. The trusts expired in 1985 and, per tax law, the foundations must give away 5% of their assets per year. Disbursements from each foundation are done through boards of directors.

In 1973, he became estranged from his sister Cordelia and he took control of many of the family foundations while Cordelia supported her own charities, including Planned Parenthood and the National Aviary in Pittsburgh. Shortly before her death, the siblings reconciled, and he eulogized her in January 2005, lauding Cordelia for devoting her life and resources to &quot;worthwhile causes&quot;.

==Business==

===Purchase of the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;===
In 1970, Scaife purchased a small market newspaper, then known as the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;. The paper was based in Greensburg, the county seat and center of Westmoreland County, located about 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. For a number of years, the paper was published and distributed only in the Westmoreland area.

Scaife made headlines in the fall of 1973 when a &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; reporter was fired for making the remark &quot;one down and one to go&quot; during the Watergate era when Vice President Spiro T. Agnew resigned over corruption charges dating back to his days as governor of Maryland. In the controversy that followed nearly half the paper&#x27;s 24 person newsroom staff resigned. In 1992, the two main newspapers in Pittsburgh were embroiled in a lengthy labor dispute that ultimately led the larger paper, the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot;, to cease operations, and for the remaining paper, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, to suspend publication for nearly six months until the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; acquired the &quot;Press&quot; late that year.

During this time, Scaife expanded operations of his newspaper into Pittsburgh. He essentially created a newspaper from the ground up and named it the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; while maintaining the Greensburg operation separately. He moved the Pittsburgh headquarters to the D. L. Clark building on Martindale Street on Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Side.

===Leadership and media interests===
The &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; continues to challenge the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; in the Pittsburgh media market. Twelve years after Scaife&#x27;s newspaper began publishing, the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; reported major financial losses, and the unions representing its employees agreed to wage concessions to keep it afloat. Unlike Scaife, the owners of the Post-Gazette, the Block family, were unwilling to sustain major losses year after year. According to the Scaife divorce papers, Richard Scaife has consistently spent between $20 and $30 million per year to cover the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;″s losses. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulation, the Tribune-Review has a combined 221,000 regional circulation, about 7,000 subscribers fewer than its competitor.

In 2005, the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot; announced that operations of its suburban editions would be consolidated, with &quot;staff reductions&quot; in the newsrooms, business, and circulation departments. Two managers were laid off immediately along with several other staff members later in 2005.

With Scaife as publisher, the small circulation newspaper was the chief packager of editorials and news columns claiming that then United States President Bill Clinton or his wife, then First Lady Hillary Clinton were responsible for the death of Deputy White House counsel Vince Foster. Scaife paid freelancer Christopher Ruddy to write about the Foster case for the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; and other right-leaning media. Special Prosecutor Ken Starr, appointed to investigate Clinton, concluded Foster had, in fact, committed suicide.

In 2004, Scaife was reported to own 7.2 percent of Newsmax Media, a news-based Web site with conservative political content founded by Ruddy in 1998. In 2009, Scaife reportedly controlled 42% of NewsMax, with Ruddy the 58% majority owner, CEO and editor.

Scaife owned a majority interest in Pittsburgh-based all-news radio station KQV.

From 1977 to 1989 Scaife owned the &quot;Sacramento Union&quot; newspaper in the state capital of Sacramento, California.

==Political activities==

According to his unpublished memoir, Scaife was motivated by concerns that the general trend towards liberalism in America would lead not just to inferior public policy but to the annihilation of American civilization.

While Scaife was not known for describing to others the motives or aims of his many contributions, in his book he tells of how he and a network of other influential conservatives called themselves &quot;The League to Save Carthage&quot;, the name chosen because they believed the threat of political progressivism was so dire it could not even be compared to the decline of Rome in the face of barbarians. Rather the situation was closer to Ancient Carthage, which had been totally obliterated by Rome, a defeat Scaife and his fellow conservatives attributed to the passivity of its elites in the face of the enemy.

===Support for Richard Nixon===
As early as 1968, Scaife was actively involved at the highest levels of the Nixon campaign. He was appointed to lead the United Citizens for Nixon-Agnew during the fall of 1968.

Scaife gained notoriety for evading weak campaign finance laws to donate US$990,000 to the 1972 re-election campaign of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. Scaife was not charged with a crime, but about $45,000 went to a fund linked to the Watergate scandal. Scaife later said he was repulsed by the scandal and refused to speak with Nixon after 1973. Following Robert Duggan&#x27;s suicide and then Watergate, he shifted his political giving from politicians&#x27; campaigns to anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications. During the scandal, John Ehrlichman suggested having Scaife buy out &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in a hostile takeover from Katharine Graham in order to halt Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein&#x27;s reporting.

===Opposition to Bill Clinton===
Scaife&#x27;s publications were substantially involved in coverage against then-President Bill Clinton:
* Scaife was the major backer of &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, whose Arkansas Project set out to find facts about Clinton and in which Paula Jones&#x27; accusations of sexual harassment against Clinton were first widely publicized.
* On April 15, 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that Scaife had spent nearly $2 million on the project.
* In a 1999 series of articles on Scaife and foundations that support conservative causes, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; named a close Scaife associate, Richard Larry, and not Scaife himself as the man who drove the Arkansas Project, while also acknowledging that Scaife was still the project&#x27;s lead financier. The question of how political intellectualism was centered in the subject or in his key aides, such as Richard Larry, R. Daniel McMichael, or others, remains an open question.

The project not only accused Clinton of financial and sexual indiscretions (some later verified, others not), but also gave root to conspiracist notions that the Clintons collaborated with the CIA to run a drug smuggling operation out of the town of Mena, Arkansas and that Clinton had arranged for the murder of White House aide Vince Foster as part of a coverup of the Whitewater scandal. The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate David Hale, a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen subpoenaed Scaife, who testified before a federal grand jury in the matter.

In the fall of 2007, however, Ruddy published a positive interview with former President Clinton on Newsmax, followed by a positive cover story in the magazine. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted with reference to the event that politics had made &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Ruddy praised Clinton for his Foundation&#x27;s global work, and explained that the interview, as well as a private lunch he and Scaife had had with Clinton, which Ruddy says was orchestrated by Ed Koch, were due to his shared view, with Scaife that Clinton was doing important work representing the U.S. globally while America was the target of criticism. He also said that he and Scaife had never suggested Clinton was involved in Foster&#x27;s death, nor had they spread allegations about Clinton&#x27;s sex scandals, although their work may have encouraged others.

Despite his political opposition to Clinton, the two men forged a friendship after Clinton left office. They became so close that Clinton spoke at a private memorial service for Scaife on August 2, 2014.

===Political donations===
According to campaignmoney.com, from 1999 through 2006, Scaife, under the name &quot;R. Scaife&quot;, made ten contributions of over $200 to political campaigns, for a total of $19,000. Under the name &quot;R.M. Scaife&quot;, he made four donations totaling $22,000. Under the name &quot;Richard Scaife&quot;, he made 23 donations over this period which totaled $142,904. Besides donations to the Republican National Committee and various political campaigns such as Santorum 2000 and the Santorum Victory Committee for Rick Santorum, he has also supported political action committees such as the Pro-Growth Action Team, the Free Congress PAC (formerly: Committee For the Survival Of a Free Congress), and the Club for Growth Inc. PAC. Scaife also funded the Western Journalism Center, headed by Joseph Farah. He was named to the PoliticsPA list of &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;s Top Political Activists&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
Scaife gave away an estimated $1 billion plus adjusted for inflation from his family fortune on philanthropy. He estimated that $620 million of this was &quot;aimed at influencing American public affairs&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called him &quot;the leading financial supporter of the movement that reshaped American politics in the last quarter of the 20th century.&quot; At the same time, according to journalist Jane Mayer, he gave almost no interviews or speeches on his motives and aims&quot;, and &quot;rarely spoke with those who ran the institutions he funded&quot;.

===Management of the Scaife family foundations===
When Scaife refocused his political giving away from individuals and toward anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications, the first among these was the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace at Stanford University.

Through contacts made at Hoover and elsewhere, Scaife became a major, early supporter of The Heritage Foundation, which has since become one of Washington&#x27;s most influential conservative public policy research institutes. He served as vice-chairman of the Heritage Foundation board of trustees.

Later, he supported such varied conservative and libertarian organizations as:
* American Enterprise Institute
* Atlas Economic Research Foundation
* David Horowitz Freedom Center
* Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, which advocates for free-market solutions to environmental issues and dissent on anthropogenic global warming
* Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, a Harrisburg-based libertarian think tank
* Federalist Society
* Foundation for Economic Education
* Free Congress Foundation (headed by Jim Gilmore)
* Freedom House
* GOPAC (headed by Newt Gingrich)
* Independent Women&#x27;s Forum
* Intercollegiate Studies Institute (which operates the Collegiate Network)
* Judicial Watch
* Landmark Legal Foundation
* The Media Institute
* Media Research Center (headed by Brent Bozell)
* Pacific Legal Foundation
* Reason Foundation

By 1998, his foundations were listed among donors to over 100 such groups, to which he had disbursed some $340 million by 2002.

===Pepperdine University===
Scaife also endowed a new school of public policy at Pepperdine University. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was named the first dean of this school. Pepperdine has denied any connection between Scaife and the selection of Starr. Starr accepted the post in 1996, but in the ensuing controversy, he gave up the appointment in 1998 before ever having started at Pepperdine. After the investigation, Starr was appointed to head Pepperdine&#x27;s law school in 2004, and became president of Baylor University in 2010.

===Other philanthropic support===
Scaife was identified with his contributions to conservative and libertarian causes. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1999 dubbed him &quot;funding father of the Right.&quot;

However, Scaife supported certain policy research groups which are not explicitly conservative, such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and the Foreign Policy Research Institute (FPRI), at the University of Pennsylvania, among others. He was also a major donor to abortion rights advocates, including Planned Parenthood, giving &quot;millions&quot; to the organization, although most of the donations ended in the 1970s, according to &quot;The Washington Post.&quot;

In the late 1990s, during the height of the Clinton scandals, Scaife nevertheless continued to provide more than $1 million to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the prime benefactor of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). His donations to restore and beautify the White House led to an invitation by Hillary Clinton for a black-tie celebration. She warmly received him and posed for a photograph on the same day her husband&#x27;s sex scandal hit the press. Scaife told the &quot;New York Post&quot; that he appreciated Mrs. Clinton&#x27;s invitation. &quot;I&#x27;m honored&quot;, he said, &quot;Lord knows, it&#x27;s more than I got from [the first] George Bush&quot;.

Scaife also supported non-political groups. He was a key benefactor of a number of Pittsburgh-based arts organizations: Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Sarah Scaife Galleries at the Carnegie Institute of Pittsburgh art museum, the Brandywine Conservancy, the Phipps Conservatory, and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., as well as Goodwill Industries of Pittsburgh. He and his foundations contributed to Sarah Scaife&#x27;s favorite causes: population control (e.g. Planned Parenthood), environmental conservation, and hospitals; Jonas Salk developed his polio vaccine in a Sarah Scaife funded laboratory. He also supported a variety of educational institutions, notably the University of Chicago, The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, Carnegie Mellon University, Boston University, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Rochester, Smith College, Bowling Green State University, and his prep school, Deerfield Academy.

==Personal life==
Scaife&#x27;s first marriage was to Frances L. Gilmore (born December 2, 1934). The couple had two children, Jennie K. Scaife (born July 8, 1963; died November 29, 2018), and David N. Scaife (born February 5, 1966). The couple subsequently divorced.

In June 1991, he married his longtime companion Margaret &quot;Ritchie&quot; Battle (born February 15, 1947), who had made the couple active in the social and cultural life of Pittsburgh. The couple subsequently separated, and, on December 27, 2005, the Pittsburgh Police responded to a call placed by Richard Scaife reporting trespassing at Scaife&#x27;s residence in the prestigious Shadyside section of Pittsburgh. They arrived to find his estranged wife, pounding on doors and peeking in windows of the couple&#x27;s mansion. Mrs. Scaife refused to leave the property, and was arrested and charged with defiant trespass.

On April 8, 2006, the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; published an article describing a fight between Scaife&#x27;s estranged wife and three of his servants over a dog that Scaife told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; his wife had given him. Both newspapers reported that Scaife&#x27;s servants went to the hospital for scrapes and bruises after the fracas. Scaife later hung a sign on his lawn: &quot;Wife and dog missing – reward for dog&quot;. Three days later, on April 11, Scaife confided to a gossip columnist that he and Margaret Scaife planned to divorce and that their marriage began without a prenuptial agreement. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; column estimated his vulnerable assets at half of $1.2 billion.

In September 2007, the &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; and reporter Dennis Roddy found that the Scaife divorce papers, which had been under seal, were available to the public on the Web site of the Allegheny County Prothonotary&#x27;s office. The &quot;Post-Gazette&quot; made the divorce papers available in full on its site. The papers include a full list of the possessions Margaret Scaife alleged her husband had taken and was keeping from her.

He was named to the PoliticsPA list of &quot;Sy Snyder&#x27;s Power 50&quot; list of influential individuals in Pennsylvania politics in 2002 and 2003.

On May 18, 2014, he announced that his doctors had diagnosed him with an untreatable form of cancer as part of an introspective column in the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot;.

==Steve Kangas incident==
On February 8, 1999, former military intelligence specialist and progressive writer Steve Kangas committed suicide less than 60 feet (18 m) from Scaife&#x27;s office door inside One Oxford Centre in Pittsburgh. He had been an outspoken critic of Scaife and believed that Scaife-funded initiatives posed a danger to the nation. Scaife hired Rex Armistead and a reporter from the &quot;Tribune-Review&quot; to investigate whether or not Kangas had been out to kill Scaife.

==Death==

Scaife died after a battle with cancer on the morning of July 4, 2014 at his home, one day after his 82nd birthday. He also owned homes in Pebble Beach, California; Nantucket, Massachusetts; and Ligonier, Pennsylvania.

Clapton once described him as &quot;the best guitar player alive&quot;. In 1999, Guy wrote the book &quot;Damn Right I&#x27;ve Got the Blues&quot;, with Donald Wilcock. His autobiography, &quot;When I Left Home: My Story&quot;, was published in 2012.

==Early life==

George &quot;Buddy&quot; Guy was born and raised in Lettsworth, Louisiana. He was the first of five children to parents Sam and Isabel, who were sharecroppers, and as a child, Guy would pick cotton for $2.50 per 100 pounds. His brother Phil Guy was also a blues musician. 
He began learning to play the guitar using a two-string diddley bow he made. Later he was given a Harmony acoustic guitar which, decades later in Guy&#x27;s lengthy career, was donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Career==
In the mid-1950s, Guy began performing with bands in Baton Rouge, including with Big Papa Tilley and Raful Neal. While living there, he worked as a custodian at Louisiana State University. In 1957, he recorded two demos for a local DJ in Baton Rouge for Ace Records, but they were not issued at the time.

Soon after moving to Chicago on September 25, 1957, Guy fell under the influence of Muddy Waters. In 1958, a competition with West Side guitarists Magic Sam and Otis Rush gave Guy a record contract. Soon afterwards he recorded for Cobra Records. During his Cobra sessions, he teamed up with Ike Turner who helped him make his second record, &quot;You Sure Can&#x27;t Do&quot; / &quot;This Is The End&quot;, by backing him on guitar and composing the latter. After two releases from Cobra&#x27;s subsidiary, Artistic, Guy signed with Chess Records.

Guy&#x27;s early career was impeded by his record company, Chess Records, his label from 1959 to 1968, which refused to record Guy playing in the novel style of his live shows. Leonard Chess, Chess Records founder, denounced Guy&#x27;s playing as &quot;just making noise&quot;. In the early 1960s, Chess tried recording Guy as a solo artist with R&amp;B ballads, jazz instrumentals, soul and novelty dance tunes, but none of these recordings was released as a single. Guy&#x27;s only Chess album, &quot;I Left My Blues in San Francisco&quot;, was released in 1967. Most of the songs were influenced by the era&#x27;s soul boom, with orchestrations by Gene Barge and Charlie Stepney. Chess used Guy mainly as a session guitarist to back Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor and others. As late as 1967, Guy worked as a tow truck driver while playing clubs at night.

During his tenure with Chess, Guy recorded sessions with Junior Wells for Delmark Records under the pseudonym Friendly Chap in 1965 and 1966. In 1965, he participated in the European tour American Folk Blues Festival.

He appeared onstage at the March 1969 &quot;Supershow&quot; in Staines, England, which also included Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Jack Bruce, Stephen Stills, Buddy Miles, Glenn Campbell, Roland Kirk, Jon Hiseman, and the Misunderstood. In 1972, he established The Checkerboard Lounge, with partner L.C. Thurman. He left it in 1985 and reported in a 2024 interview that it never made money.

Guy&#x27;s career was revived during the blues revival of the late 1980s and early 1990s. His resurgence was sparked by Clapton&#x27;s request that Guy be part of the &quot;24 Nights&quot; all-star blues guitar lineup at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. Guy subsequently signed with Silvertone Records and recorded his mainstream breakthrough album &quot;Damn Right, I&#x27;ve Got the Blues&quot; in 1991.

Guy had a small role in the 2009 crime film &quot;In the Electric Mist&quot; as Sam &quot;Hogman&quot; Patin.

As of 2019, Guy still performs at least 130 nights a year, including a month of shows each January at his Chicago blues club, Buddy Guy&#x27;s Legends.

In June 2024, he headlined the Chicago Blues Festival as part of his &quot;Buddy Guy Damn Right Farewell Tour.&quot;

== Artistry and legacy ==

===Music style===
While Guy&#x27;s music is often labelled Chicago blues, his style is unique and separate. His music can vary from the most traditional, deepest blues to a creative, unpredictable and radical gumbo of the blues, avant rock, soul and free jazz that changes with each performance.

As the &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Jon Pareles noted in 2005,
In an interview taped on April 14, 2000, for the Cleveland college station WRUW-FM, Guy said, 
===Guitars===
Guy has played numerous guitars over the course of his career and continues to use multiple guitars in concerts and recordings, but he has become known for his custom model Fenders with their characteristic Polka-dot finish. In a June 2022 interview, Guy explained that the Polka-dot pattern was a tribute to his late mother, and to remind him of a lie he told her when leaving home to start his career in Chicago: The original guitar was based on the Eric Clapton Custom Shop Stratocaster that Guy had been playing in the late 80s and has since been developed into its own line of Buddy Guy Signature models that Fender sells to the public. Various models of the Polka-dot guitar and Polka-dot motif feature in the artwork for a number of his albums since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Slippin&#x27; In&quot;. Recent years saw him on stage wearing a shirt of the same design.

===Accolades===
When inducting Guy into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eric Clapton said, &quot;No matter how great the song, or performance, my ear would always find him out. He stood out in the mix, simply by virtue of the originality and vitality of his playing.&quot;

Jeff Beck recalled the night he and Stevie Ray Vaughan performed with Guy at Buddy Guy&#x27;s Legends club in Chicago: &quot;That was just the most incredible stuff I ever heard in my life. The three of us all jammed and it was so thrilling. That is as close you can come to the heart of the blues.&quot;

Former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman said,

Guy was a judge for the 6th and 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.

Guy has influenced the styles of subsequent artists such as Reggie Sears and Jesse Marchant of JBM.

On February 21, 2012, Guy performed in concert at the White House for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. During the finale of the concert, he persuaded President Obama to sing a few bars of &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;.

==Awards==
On September 20, 1996, Guy was inducted into Guitar Center&#x27;s Hollywood Rockwalk.

Guy has won eight Grammy Awards, for his work on electric and acoustic guitars and for contemporary and traditional forms of blues music, as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2003, he was presented with the National Medal of Arts, awarded by the President of the United States to those who have made extraordinary contributions to the creation, growth and support of the arts in the United States.

By 2004, Guy had also earned 23 W.C. Handy Awards, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Century Award (he was its second recipient) for distinguished artistic achievement, and the title of Greatest Living Electric Blues Guitarist.

Guy was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 14, 2005, by Eric Clapton and B.B. King. Clapton recalled seeing Guy perform in London&#x27;s Marquee Club in 1965, impressing him with his technique, his looks and his charismatic showmanship. He remembered seeing Guy pick the guitar with his teeth and play it over his head—two tricks that later influenced Jimi Hendrix. Guy&#x27;s acceptance speech was concise: &quot;If you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve got the blues, just keep living.&quot; He had previously served on the nominating committee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2008, Guy was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame, performing at the Texas Club in Baton Rouge to commemorate the occasion.

In October 2009, he performed &quot;Let Me Love You Baby&quot; with Jeff Beck at the 25th anniversary concert at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.

On November 15, 2010, he performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode also included an interview with Guy by program host Nic Harcourt.

On December 2, 2012, Guy was awarded the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors. At his induction, Kennedy Center chairman David Rubenstein said, &quot;Buddy Guy is a titan of the blues and has been a tremendous influence on virtually everyone who has picked up an electric guitar in the last half century&quot;. In a musical tribute to Guy, blues vocal powerhouse Beth Hart, accompanied by guitarist Jeff Beck, sang a rousing version of &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Go Blind&quot;. Also honored that night were actor Dustin Hoffman, surviving members of the rock band Led Zeppelin (John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant), comedian and late-night TV host David Letterman and prima ballerina and choreographer Natalia Makarova.

On January 28, 2014, Guy was inducted into Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum.

In 2015, Guy received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

&quot;Born to Play Guitar&quot; won a Grammy Award in 2016 for Best Blues Album. Also in 2016, Guy toured the US east coast as the opening act for Jeff Beck.

December 8, 2018 was designated &quot;Buddy Guy Day&quot; by Louisiana and Mississippi officials and a stretch of Highway 418 through Lettsworth was designated &quot;Buddy Guy Way&quot;.

In 2018, Guy was honored with a marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana.

In 2019, Guy received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Jimmy Page.

==Personal life==
Guy married Joan Guy in 1959. They have six children together: Charlotte (1961), Carlise (1963), Colleen (1965), George Jr., Gregory, and Geoffrey. Greg Guy also plays blues guitar.

He was married to Jennifer Guy from 1975 to 2002. They had two children: Rashawnna and Michael. The marriage ended in divorce. Rashawnna Guy, known by her stage name Shawnna, is a rapper.

Guy has lived on 14 acres in Orland Park, Illinois, a suburb south of Chicago . He is an early riser, which he attributes to growing up on a farm. &quot;Doesn’t matter how late I get home from a show, I know I will be up, like, three, four o’clock in the morning.” His only indulgence is a shot of cognac at every show.

<text>The Royal Society Science Books Prize is an annual £25,000 prize awarded by the Royal Society to celebrate outstanding popular science books from around the world. It is open to authors of science books written for a non-specialist audience, and since it was established in 1988 has championed writers such as Stephen Hawking, Jared Diamond, Stephen Jay Gould and Bill Bryson. In 2015 &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the prize as &quot;the most prestigious science book prize in Britain&quot;.

==History==
The Royal Society established the Science Books Prize in 1988 with the aim of encouraging the writing, publishing and reading of good and accessible popular science books. Its name has varied according to sponsorship agreements.
==Judging process==

A panel of judges decides the shortlist and the winner of the Prize each year. The panel is chaired by a fellow of the Royal Society and includes authors, scientists and media personalities. The judges for the 2016 prize included author Bill Bryson, theoretical physicist Dr Clare Burrage, science fiction author Alastair Reynolds, ornithologist and science blogger GrrlScientist, and author and director of external affairs at the Science Museum Group, Roger Highfield. In 2019, the jury consisted of Sir Nigel Shadbolt, Shukry James Habib, Dorothy Koomson, Stephen McGann, and Gwyneth Williams.

All books entered for the prize must be published in English for the first time between September and October the preceding year. The winner is announced at an award ceremony and receives £25,000. Each of the other shortlisted authors receives £2,500.

<doc id="566993" wikidata="Q3346244" url="?curid=566993" title="Draw by agreement">
<text>A game of chess can end in a draw by agreement. A player may offer a draw at any stage of a game; if the opponent accepts, the game is a draw. In some competitions, draws by agreement are restricted; for example draw offers may be subject to the discretion of the arbiter, or may be forbidden before move 30 or 40, or even forbidden altogether. The majority of draws in chess are by agreement.

Under FIDE rules, a draw should be offered after making the move and before pressing the clock, then marked in the scoresheet as &quot;(=)&quot;. However, draw offers made at any time are valid. If a player offers a draw before making a move, the opponent has the option of requesting a move before deciding whether or not to accept the offer. Once made, a draw offer cannot be retracted and is valid until rejected.

A player may offer a draw by asking, &quot;Would you like a draw?&quot;, or similar; the French word &quot;remis&quot; (literally &quot;reset&quot;) is internationally understood as a draw offer and may be used if the players do not share a common language. Players may also offer draws and accept draw offers by merely nodding their heads. A draw may be rejected either verbally or by making a move.

A draw by agreement after less than twenty moves where neither player makes a serious effort to win is colloquially known as a &quot;grandmaster draw&quot;. Many chess players and organizers disapprove of grandmaster draws, and efforts have been made to discourage them, such as forbidding draw offers before move 30. However, professional players have defended grandmaster draws, saying they are important to conserve energy during a tournament.
==Etiquette==
Although a draw may be offered at any time, an illogical offer runs the risk of violating article 11.5, which states: &quot;It is forbidden to distract or annoy the opponent in any manner whatsoever. This includes [...] unreasonable offers of a draw[.]&quot; This rule is applied with the arbiter&#x27;s discretion; for example, a player loudly offering a draw while the opponent is thinking may well suffer a time penalty or even forfeit the game, but it is unlikely that a player would be penalized for offering a draw in a lifeless position when it is not their turn to move.

At one time, chess players considered it bad manners to play out a superior but theoretically drawn endgame. In such cases, the superior side was expected to offer a draw.

There are certain behavioural norms relating to draw offers not codified in the FIDE Laws of Chess but widely observed. For example, many consider it bad manners for a player who has offered a draw once to do so again before their opponent has offered a draw. Such repeated offers of a draw have also sometimes been considered distracting enough to warrant the arbiter taking action under article 11.5.
It is considered bad etiquette to offer a draw in a clearly lost position or even when one has no winning chances but one&#x27;s opponent does. Garry Kasparov regularly criticizes grandmasters who offer a draw when their position is worse. However, such offers are sometimes used as psychological tricks. The position in the diagram arose in the game Samuel Reshevsky–Fotis Mastichiadis, Dubrovnik 1950. Reshevsky played 24.Nd2?, and saw at once that he would be put into a very bad situation with 24...Nxf2. Thinking quickly, he offered a draw to his opponent, who was busy writing down the move in his scoresheet. Mastichiadis, a minor master, was so happy to get half a point against his illustrious opponent that he did not pause to examine the position before accepting the offer.

The rule about the procedure of offering a draw was violated in a 1981 game between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. Kasparov moved 17. Ra2 and offered a draw. Karpov instantly replied 17... Be7 and then said &quot;Make a move!&quot;, which is a violation of the rule. Kasparov moved 18. b5 and then Karpov accepted the draw.

In the 1958 game between Tigran Petrosian and Bobby Fischer, Fischer offered a draw without making a move first, which was accepted by Petrosian. He explains in his book &quot;My 60 Memorable Games&quot;:

I offered a draw, not realizing it was bad etiquette. It was Petrosian&#x27;s place to extend the draw offer after 67...Rxg6+ [...] 68.Kxg6 Kb1 69.f8=Q c2 with a book draw. (See queen versus pawn endgame.)

==Practical considerations==

Players sometimes make draw offers in consideration of outside factors. In 1977 Viktor Korchnoi and former World Champion Tigran Petrosian played a twelve-game quarter-final Candidates Match to ultimately determine the challenger for the 1978 World Championship. After eleven games, Korchnoi was leading by one point, so he only needed a draw in the final game to advance to the semi-finals. Korchnoi, as Black, was winning this game, but he offered a draw after 40 moves. According to Edmar Mednis, it was &quot;gentlemanly and the practical thing to do&quot;. Korchnoi went on to unsuccessfully challenge Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship.

Sometimes, time constraints for one or both of the players may be a factor in agreeing to a draw. A player with an advantageous position but limited time may be agreeable to a draw to avoid risking a loss from running out of time, and the opponent may also be agreeable to a draw due to their disadvantageous position. 
==Grandmaster draw==
A or short draw is a draw reached after very few moves, usually between high-ranked players. British master P. H. Clarke wrote about the positive aspects of a short draw: Unless you are of the calibre of Botvinnik – and who is – you cannot hope to play at full power day after day. The technical draws are a necessary means of conserving energy. As such, they contribute to raising the standard of play rather than lowering it. 

All of the games of the second Piatigorsky Cup were annotated by players, including the short draws. Their comments on two short draws follow (Spassky vs. Petrosian and Reshevsky vs. Portisch), followed by comments on some other short draws.

===Spassky vs. Petrosian===

Boris Spassky wrote:
The present game once again demonstrates how grandmasters play when they do not care to win. Of course, it is not an interesting spectacle for the onlookers. However, if chess enthusiasts could find themselves in the positions of the grandmasters they would not judge them so severely. 
===Reshevsky vs. Portisch===

Lajos Portisch wrote:
Here Reshevsky offered me a draw, which was accepted. Is this a grandmaster draw? I do not think so. Reshevsky had consumed most of his time, and had only 30 minutes for the remaining moves. On my part it would have been pointless to rely on his as I saw that after 17. dxe5 Nd5 18. Bxe7 Qxe7 19. Nxd5 Bxd5 20. Be4, the draw is evident. In such a strong tournament and against such outstanding players it would not be wise to try to win a game of this kind. One could only lose energy. Neither side had any advantage, so why try to force the issue? 
===Averbakh vs. Fischer===

In the 1958 game between Yuri Averbakh and Bobby Fischer, the players agreed to a draw in an unclear position where White is a piece ahead. Asked about the draw, the teenage Fischer said, &quot;I was afraid of losing to a Russian grandmaster and he was afraid of losing to a kid.&quot; Averbakh stated that Fischer offered the draw and that each player had only about ten minutes to make the 19 or 20 moves before time control.
===Karpov vs. Kasparov===

Several short draws occurred in the World Chess Championship 1984 between Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov. This one occurred in the 29th game after thirteen moves. Kasparov explains Draw agreed on Black&#x27;s proposal: with the resulting complete symmetry, the fighting resources are practically exhausted. White had used 99 minutes; Black had used 51 minutes.
===Keres vs. Petrosian===

In 1962 a Candidates Tournament was held in Curaçao to determine the challenger to Mikhail Botvinnik in the 1963 World Championship. There is good evidence that Soviet players Tigran Petrosian, Paul Keres, and Efim Geller arranged to draw all of the games between themselves. The twelve games played between these three players were all short draws, averaging 19 moves.

This diagram shows the final position from the shortest one – only fourteen moves were played. This was in the 25th of 28 rounds, and the final game between Keres and Petrosian. Bobby Fischer charged that Petrosian accepted a draw when he was winning and Jan Timman agrees. Petrosian went on to win the tournament and win the championship from Botvinnik.
===Tal vs. Botvinnik===

In the 21st of 24 games of the 1960 World Chess Championship between Mikhail Tal and Mikhail Botvinnik, Tal only needed a half point to win the title, so he got to a position where Black had no winning chances, and quickly agreed to a draw.
===Polugaevsky vs. Tal===
In the 1967 USSR Championship, Lev Polugaevsky and Mikhail Tal were leading with the same number of points going into the next-to-last round. They played each other that round. After
:1. d4 Nf6
:2. c4 e6
Polugaevsky offered a draw. Tal explains I played 2...e6 and Lev offered me a draw. I accepted, although for decency&#x27;s sake we made a further 12 moves or so, and the question of first place was put off until the last round..

===Kasparov vs. Karpov===

Before the 20th game of the 1986 World Championship, Kasparov had just lost three games in a row, which evened the match score. Kasparov had White in the 20th game, in which a draw was agreed after 21 moves. White had used 1 hour and 11 minutes; Black used 1 hour and 52 minutes. Kasparov writes &quot;In the 20th game we decided in the end &#x27;not to play&#x27; (i.e. to aim for a short draw) [...] A typical grandmaster draw, although one can understand the two players – each fulfilled the objective he had set himself before the game.&quot; Kasparov did not want to lose a fourth game in a row, and Karpov wanted to draw as Black.
===Kasparov vs. Smyslov===
Kasparov had this to say about one of the games of his 1984 match against Vasily Smyslov: &quot;It all ended in a &#x27;planned&#x27; draw, and I was not exactly delighted with such a pre-programmed result.&quot;

==Steps taken to discourage draws==

Although many games logically end in a draw after a hard-fought battle between the players, there have been attempts throughout history to discourage or completely disallow draws. Chess is the only widely played sport where the contestants can agree to a draw at any time for any reason.

Because &quot;grandmaster draws&quot; are widely considered unsatisfactory both for spectators (who may only see half-an-hour of play with nothing very interesting happening) and sponsors (who suffer from decreased interest in the media), various measures have been adopted over the years to discourage players from agreeing to draws.

===Only theoretical draws allowed (Sofia Rules)===

Chess trainer Mark Dvoretsky, writing in a column for the website Chess Cafe, suggested that agreed draws should not be allowed at all, pointing out that such an agreement cannot be reached in other sports such as boxing. Although some have claimed that outlawing agreed draws entirely requires players to carry on playing in &quot;dead&quot; positions (where no side can reasonably play for a win), Dvoretsky says that this is a small problem and that the effort required to play out these positions until a draw can be claimed by repetition or lack of material, for example, is minimal.

The Sofia 2005 tournament employed a similar rule, which has become known as &quot;Sofia rules&quot;. The players could not draw by agreement, but they could have draws by stalemate, threefold repetition, the fifty-move rule, and insufficient material. Other draws are only allowed if the arbiter declares it is a drawn position.

Also known as the &quot;Sofia-Corsica Rules&quot;, the anti-draw measure was adopted in the Bilbao Final Masters and the FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010 (part of the qualifying cycle for the World Chess Championship 2012) did not allow players to offer a draw. The draw had to be claimed with the , who was assisted by an experienced grandmaster. The following draws were only allowed through the Chief Arbiter:
* Threefold repetition of position
* Fifty-move rule
* Perpetual check
* A theoretical draw

===No draw offers before a certain move===

In 1929, the first edition of the FIDE Laws of Chess required thirty moves to be played before a draw by agreement. This rule was discarded when the rules were revised in 1952. In 1954 FIDE rejected a request to reinstate the rule, but it did state that it is unethical and unsportsmanlike to agree to a draw before a serious contest had begun. FIDE stated that the director should discipline players who repeatedly disrespect this guideline, but it seemed to have no effect on players. In 1962 FIDE reinstated a version of the rule against draws by agreement in fewer than thirty moves, with the director allowing them in exceptional circumstances. FIDE had the intention of enforcing the rule and the penalty was a loss of the game by both players. However, players ignored it or got around it by intentional threefold repetition. Directors were unable or unwilling to enforce the rule. In 1963 FIDE made another attempt to strengthen the rule. Draws by agreement before thirty moves were forbidden, and the penalty was forfeit by both players. Directors were to investigate draws by repetition of position to see if they were to circumvent the rule. The rule was dropped in 1964 because it was decided that it had not encouraged aggressive play.

In 2003, GM Maurice Ashley wrote an essay &quot;The End of the Draw Offer?&quot;, which raised discussion about ways to avoid quick agreed draws in chess tournaments. Ashley proposed that draw offers not be allowed before move 50.

The 2003 Generation Chess International Tournament in New York City had a rule that draws could not be agreed to before move fifty (draws by other means, such as threefold repetition or stalemate, were permissible at any stage).

In the World Chess Championship 2016 and 2018, the players were not permitted to agree a draw before move 30. In the 2021, 2023 and 2024 championships, this was extended to move 40.

===Replay the game (gladiator chess)===

In the very first international round-robin tournament in London in 1862, drawn games had to be replayed until there was a decisive result. A similar format, called gladiator chess, was introduced in the Danish Chess Championships 2006.

Proposed cure for severe acute &quot;drawitis&quot; by FIDE officials Eliminates draws completely by forcing a fast time control game to be played after an accepted draw proposal to ensure there is always a winner and a loser. One potential issue for this proposal is that both players can quickly agree to a draw in the tournament game and then play a speed chess game to decide things. The FIDE 128 player tournament has seen many matches where the two tournament time control games are drawn and advancement is decided by rapid (thirty minutes for a game) or blitz (five minutes) games.

===Alternative scoring systems===
====3-1-0 scoring system====

The 3-1-0 scoring system awards three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. This system discourages draws, since draws are worth only two-thirds of their previous value. It was adopted by FIFA for football matches in 1994, after many leagues around the world had used it successfully to reduce the number of stalling draws. FIFA formerly employed the 2-1-0 scoring system, which is equivalent to that used generally in chess today: one point for a win, half a point for a draw, and no points for a loss. A 3-1-0 system was first used in the 2003 Lippstadt chess tournament and again in the 2008 Bilbao chess tournament.

At the 1964 FIDE Congress, the Puerto Rican delegate proposed that a win be given four points, a draw be given two points, a game played and lost one point, and no points for a forfeit. This would be equivalent to a 3-1-0 system with a 1 point penalty for forfeit. This had been suggested previously by Isaac Kashdan but was not implemented.

This system has received some criticism. GM Larry Kaufman points out that the reason for the high draw rate is not one of incentives, but rather the nature of chess as a game: White has a first-move advantage, but it is not enough to win by force. He thus argues that Black should consider a draw to be a good result, and should not be penalised for it: under the 3-1-0 system, Kaufman argues that chess would become like &quot;a game of &#x27;chicken&#x27;; who will &#x27;blink&#x27; first and play an unsound move to avoid the mutually bad result of a draw?&quot;. It has also been pointed out that the 3-1-0 system incentivises players to trade wins with each other instead of agreeing to draws, and gives players an easier time cheating as a team. (A team of players enters an open event; one of them is selected to obtain the maximum score and portion of the prize fund, and the others throw their games to that player; the prize is then shared among the team. This is easier to do when a win earns more points.)

====BAP scoring system====

The BAP System was designed to make it undesirable for one or both players to agree to a draw by changing the point value of win/loss/draw based on color played: three points for winning as Black, two points for winning as White, one point for drawing as Black, and no points for drawing as White or for losing as either White or Black.

The BAP System was developed by Clint Ballard, a chess aficionado and software-company president, who named it the Ballard Anti-draw Point system (BAP). Ballard explained the purpose of the BAP System: &quot;The usual flurry of last round draws in almost all tournaments makes chess unmarketable on TV. No excitement, no drama, no TV money for chess. Chess will NEVER succeed in the American TV market until we eliminate the draw as anything other than a very rare outcome. With my anti-draw point system, I am hoping to make 100% of games fighting games with risk and uncertainty, i.e. dramatic potential.&quot;
The BAP System was first used in the 2006 Bainbridge Slugfest tournament.

====Other scoring systems====

There have been proposals that certain kinds of draws should be worth more points than others. Ed Epp has suggested that draws should be scored as 0.4–0.6 to compensate for White&#x27;s first-move advantage. Many players, including former world champions Emanuel Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca, have argued that stalemate should be worth more than a normal draw, with three-quarters of a point for a side delivering stalemate (one-quarter of a point going to the side who is stalemated). Kaufman and Arno Nickel have suggested that stalemate and bare king should both be scored as ¾ to the superior side, and that a player who brings about threefold repetition should only be awarded ¼ of a point, citing engine statistics to argue that this would be sufficient to solve the draw death problem (in the trial games simulating human World Championship level, the draw rate was decreased by these rule changes from 65.6% to 22.6%).

===Financial penalties===

In the previously mentioned 2003 Generation Chess International Tournament, players agreeing to premature draws were to be fined 10% of their appearance fee and 10% of any prize money won. In a similar vein, the tournament organiser Luis Rentero (best known for organising the very strong tournaments in Linares) has sometimes enforced a rule whereby draws cannot be agreed to before move thirty.

===Other===

In 2005, GM John Nunn wrote that he believed the rules did not need to change, and that the simple solution was for organizers to not invite players known for taking short draws.

<doc id="567001" wikidata="Q15042681" url="?curid=567001" title="Hollingsworth v. Virginia">
<text>Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 378 (1798), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled early in America&#x27;s history that the President of the United States has no formal role in the process of amending the United States Constitution and that the Eleventh Amendment was binding on cases already pending prior to its ratification.

==Background==
Levi Hollingsworth was a Pennsylvania merchant who owned shares in the Indiana Company, which was heavily involved in land speculation. The Indiana Company was seeking to resolve a land claim with the state of Virginia regarding land in what is now West Virginia. Hollingsworth replaced a previous plaintiff in the case, a Virginian named William Grayson. This replacement was made when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot; (1793) that a state could be sued in federal court by a citizen of another state; Hollingsworth was from another state, whereas Grayson was not. This derivative suit dragged on, and President John Adams announced on January 8, 1798 that the Eleventh Amendment was ratified. That Amendment overturned &quot;Chisholm&quot;.

So, the first main issue in the case became whether the Eleventh Amendment was valid, not having been presented to the President for approval or veto. The second main issue was whether the Eleventh Amendment applied retroactively to ongoing cases that had already begun before the Amendment was ratified.

The attorneys for Hollingsworth were William Tilghman and William Rawle. They argued for presidential involvement in the amendment process (and against the constitutionality of the Eleventh Amendment), saying: &quot;Upon an inspection of the original roll, it appears that the amendment was never submitted to the President for his approbation.&quot; The proposed amendment had been laid before President George Washington merely &quot;for transmission” to the states.

U.S. Attorney General Charles Lee took the position during oral argument in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; that the Eleventh Amendment had been properly proposed, and Lee&#x27;s argument was reproduced together with the opposing argument and the Court&#x27;s decision in the case. Here is the exchange between Attorney General Lee and Associate Justice Chase during oral argument:
==Decision, rationale, and later discussion by the Court==

The Court decided unanimously that the Eleventh Amendment had been validly adopted. The Court also decided in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; that it had no jurisdiction in the case, even though the case had arisen prior to ratification of the Eleventh Amendment. Here is the full text of the Court&#x27;s opinion:

In oral argument, Justice Samuel Chase had stated that the president &quot;has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution&quot;. The brief report by the reporter of decisions quotes Chase and the arguments of the opposing attorneys, but fails to explicitly give precise reasons for the Supreme Court&#x27;s unanimous decision in this case, though it is known that none of the earlier amendments had been presented to the president for approbation either.

Article V of the Constitution says: &quot;The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution&quot;. Congress thus may propose an amendment if there is a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress, without waiting for a constitutional convention or a presidential signature or anything else, according to the decision in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot;. The clarity of this language in Article V has been cited as a reason why the Court did not think that further explanation of its decision was needed.

Although the Presentment Clause generally gives the president veto power, the ancient interpretive principle that the specific governs the general (&quot;generalia specialibus non derogant&quot;) is applicable to the specific circumstance of a constitutional amendment. Article V requires Congress to propose amendments, &quot;whenever&quot; it deems necessary by the same supermajority specified in the Presentment Clause, and therefore Congress has always treated the latter vote as unnecessary and inapplicable.

The question of whether the president can veto a proposed amendment was also answered negatively in &quot;INS v. Chadha&quot; (1983), albeit in &quot;dicta&quot;:

&quot;Hollingsworth&quot; remains . Even those scholars who find it difficult to justify concede that it is firmly entrenched.

==Instance of judicial review==
&quot;Hollingsworth&quot; was one of the earliest instances of judicial review by the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, the Court decided whether the Eleventh Amendment would be upheld or stricken down. &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; also may mark the first time that the Court struck down a federal law as unconstitutional, assuming that the Court in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; was reading the Eleventh Amendment retroactively to invalidate part of the Judiciary Act of 1789.

However, there was an even earlier case, &quot;U.S. v. Todd&quot; (1794), that also may have held an act of Congress unconstitutional. In 1800, Justice Chase implied that neither &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; nor &quot;Todd&quot; involved any unconstitutional federal statute: 

Assuming that Chase was correct, then perhaps &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; was the first such case. Indeed, Walter Dellinger has written that the first judicial review of a constitutional amendment (in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot;) pre-dated the first invalidation of federal legislation (in &quot;Marbury&quot;).

==Alternative theory about the case==
In 2005, an article in the &quot;Texas Law Review&quot; by Seth B. Tillman theorized that it may be incorrect to interpret &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; as holding that constitutional amendment resolutions need not be presented to the President for possible veto. This notwithstanding that the Court—in decisions issued in the twentieth century—itself has adopted that interpretation of its prior decision in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot;. Tillman did not suggest that &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; was wrongly decided, but only that its scope (as originally understood) might have been narrower than commonly thought today.

Tillman noted that Justice Chase&#x27;s statement was not his official opinion, but merely a remark from the bench at oral argument, and therefore the failure of the other justices to contradict him should not elevate the status of Chase&#x27;s remark to an official opinion by either him or by the Court. Moreover, Tillman argued that there were several other grounds potentially explaining the Court&#x27;s decision, including: that the proposed Eleventh Amendment was in fact delivered to George Washington, he declined to sign it, and Washington&#x27;s non-signature did not amount to a pocket veto because Congress remained in session. If this latter explanation explains the Court&#x27;s obscure language in its opinion, then the Court only decided that on the particular facts actually before it the Eleventh Amendment was valid.

Other explanations for the &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; holding are also possible. For example, Tillman also noted Chase&#x27;s specific language at oral argument. Chase took the position that the president played no role in regard to the &quot;proposition ... or adoption&quot; of amendments. But the Court&#x27;s actual opinion only used the &quot;adoption&quot; language, not the &quot;proposition&quot; language used by Chase at oral argument. This might lead to the conclusion that the Court was of the view that once of the states had ratified a proposed amendment (i.e., how the amendment was &quot;adopted&quot;), then it was part of the Constitution without respect to potential defects in how an amendment (such as the Eleventh Amendment) was proposed.

During oral argument in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot;, U.S. Attorney General Lee advanced two independent arguments in support of the validity of the Eleventh Amendment (leaving aside his discussion of the issue of whether or not the amendment only had prospective effect). He argued that it was valid because presentment to the president was not necessary. Lee also argued that &quot;the amendment was in due form&quot; because it was enacted using the same procedures which were used in enacting the Bill of Rights. 3 U.S. 381.

Lee did not advance the alternative theory that the Eleventh Amendment was valid because George Washington declined to veto it. If the Court adopted this position in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot;, which was one of the theories presented in the 2005 &quot;Texas Law Review&quot; article, then the Court silently based its decision in regard to a matter of law (not fact) on arguments which were not presented to it by one of the parties. On the other hand, Lee&#x27;s &quot;due form&quot; argument is consistent with the text of the Court&#x27;s decision. And once Chase had opened discussion distinguishing the proposition of amendments (by Congress) and their adoption (by the States), the parties were on notice that these issues were important to the Court. The parties had an opportunity to speak to these issues at oral argument. If they chose to neglect them, the Court could still address them, and arguably the Court did so in its decision.

Historian David E. Kyvig has argued that the Supreme Court in &quot;Hollingsworth&quot; adopted the position put forward by Attorney General Lee, although Kyvig published that argument several years prior to the 2005 article in the &quot;Texas Law Review&quot;. Kyvig suggests that the Court adopted Lee&#x27;s position. However, Kyvig does not explain which of Lee&#x27;s specific arguments were adopted by the Court or how the language in the Court&#x27;s opinion explains the primary issue in the case: the scope of Article V and the scope of Article I, Section 7, Clause 3 and the interplay (if any) between the two provisions.

<text>The malachite kingfisher (Corythornis cristatus) is a river kingfisher which is widely distributed in Africa south of the Sahara. It is largely resident except for seasonal climate-related movements.

==Taxonomy==
The malachite kingfisher was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name &quot;Alcedo cristata&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;cristata&quot; is from the Latin &quot;cristatus&quot; meaning &quot;crested&quot; or &quot;plumed&quot;. The adjective &quot;malachite&quot; in the vernacular name normally refers to the dark green colour of the copper containing mineral. This kingfisher has blue upperparts but has black banding with pale blue or greenish-blue on its forehead.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2007 confirmed that the most closely related species is the Malagasy kingfisher, (&quot;Corythornis vintsioides&quot;). The Malagasy kingfisher has a black bill and greenish crest, and is not quite as dependent on water as the African species. It is otherwise similar in plumage and behaviour to the more widespread malachite kingfisher. The São Tomé kingfisher and the Príncipe kingfisher were sometimes considered as distinct species but a study published in 2008 showed that they are both subspecies of the malachite kingfisher.

There are five subspecies:
* &quot;C. c. galeritus&quot; (Statius Müller, PL, 1776) – Senegal to Ghana
* &quot;C. c. nais&quot; (Kaup, 1848) – island of Príncipe off the coast of West Africa (Principe kingfisher)
* &quot;C. c. thomensis&quot; Salvadori, 1902 – island of São Tomé (São Tomé kingfisher)
* &quot;C. c. cristatus&quot; (Pallas, 1764) – Nigeria eastwards to western Sudan, Uganda and Kenya, and south to southern Angola, northern Namibia and Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa
* &quot;C. c. stuartkeithi&quot; Dickerman, 1989 – eastern Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia
==Description==
It is a small kingfisher, around in length. In Southern Africa, the reference size is 14cm and in East Africa and Ethiopia, 12cm. The general color of the upper parts of the adult bird is bright metallic blue. The head has a short crest of black and blue feathers, which gives rise to the scientific name. The face, cheeks, and underparts are rufous and there are white patches on the throat and rear neck sides. The bill is black in young birds and reddish-orange in adults; the legs are bright red. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are a duller version of the adult.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is common to reeds and aquatic vegetation near slow-moving water or ponds. It occurs throughout Sub-Saharan Africa except for the very arid parts of Somalia, Kenya, Namibia and Botswana.

The flight of the malachite kingfisher is rapid, with the short, rounded wings whirring until they appear a mere blur. It usually flies low over water.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The nest is a tunnel in a sandy bank, usually over water. Both birds excavate. Most burrows incline upward before the nesting chamber is reached. Three or four clutches of three to six round, white eggs are placed on a litter of fish bones and disgorged pellets.

===Feeding===
The bird has regular perches or stands from which it fishes. These are usually low over the water. It sits upright, its tail pointed downwards. It drops suddenly with a splash and usually returns at once with a struggling captive. Large food items are beaten on a bough or rail; small fish and insects are promptly swallowed. A fish is usually lifted and carried by its middle, but its position is changed, sometimes by tossing it into the air, before it is swallowed head downwards. Fish, aquatic insects, and crustaceans are eaten.

<doc id="567012" wikidata="Q272149" url="?curid=567012" title="Mongolian death worm">
<text>The Mongolian death worm (, olgoi-khorkhoi, &quot;large intestine-worm&quot;) is a creature alleged to exist in the Gobi Desert. Investigations into the legendary creature have been pursued by amateur cryptozoologists and credentialed academics alike, but there has been little evidence found to support its existence. It can be considered a cryptid or a mythological animal.

Tales of the creature first came to Western attention as a result of Roy Chapman Andrews&#x27;s 1926 book &quot;On the Trail of Ancient Man&quot;. The American paleontologist described second-hand tales of the monster that he heard at a gathering of Mongolian officials: &quot;None of those present ever had seen the creature, but they all firmly believed in its existence and described it minutely.&quot;

In 1983, a specimen of Tartar sand boa (&quot;Eryx tataricus&quot;) was shown to locals who claimed to have seen &quot;olgoi-khorkhoi&quot; and they confirmed that this was the same animal.

== Appearance ==
In &quot;On the Trail of Ancient Man&quot;, Andrews cites Mongolian prime minister Damdinbazar, who in 1922 described the worm:
In 1932, Andrews published this information again in the book &quot;The New Conquest of Central Asia&quot;, adding: &quot;It is reported to live in the most arid, sandy regions of the western Gobi.&quot; Andrews, however, did not believe in the creature&#x27;s existence.

The worm is said to inhabit the western or southern Gobi. In the 1987 book &quot;Altajn Tsaadakh Govd&quot;, Ivan Mackerle cites a Mongolian legend which described the creature as travelling underground, creating waves of sand on the surface which allow it to be detected. It is said it can kill at a distance, either by spraying a venom at its prey or by means of electric discharge. It primarily lives and burrows underground, only rarely coming to the surface. Some reports suggest the creature emerges after rainfall and lives near sources of water.

== Investigations ==
The animal was the basis of a short story, (1944), by Russian paleontologist and science fiction writer Ivan Yefremov, written under the impression of Andrews&#x27;s book. In 1946–49 Yefremov was studying fossils in the Gobi desert and wrote that he heard the legend of olgoi-khorkhoi many times, but nobody claimed to have seen it.

In 1990 and 1992, Ivan Mackerle led small groups of companions into the Gobi Desert to search for the worm. Inspired by Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;Dune&quot;, in which giant fictional sandworms could be brought to the surface by rhythmic thumping, Mackerle constructed a motor-driven &quot;thumper&quot; and even used small explosions to try to find it.

In 2005, zoological journalist Richard Freeman of the Centre for Fortean Zoology mounted an expedition to hunt for the death worm but came up empty-handed. Freeman&#x27;s conclusion was that the tales of the worm&#x27;s powers had to be apocryphal, and that reported sightings likely involved an unknown species of worm lizard or amphisbaena.

Reality-television series &quot;Destination Truth&quot; conducted an expedition from 2006 to 2007.

A New Zealand television entertainment reporter, David Farrier of TV3 News, took part in an expedition in August 2009 but came up empty-handed as well. He conducted interviews with locals claiming to have seen the worm and mentioned on his website that the sightings peaked in the 1950s.

== Popular culture ==

*The Mongolian Death Worm is generally less culturally prevalent than other cryptids, such as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster, but it is often referenced in material that comments on, takes inspiration from, or celebrates cryptozoology as a whole.
*The worm is commonly cited as the inspiration for the Graboids, the monstrous villains designed for the &quot;Tremors&quot; film franchise.
*Official &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; material features a creature called the Purple Worm, which similarly burrows underground and uses a potent poison to kill its prey.
*&quot;Mongolian Death Worm&quot; is a 2010 television film that aired on May 8, 2010, on the Syfy channel.
*&quot;Monster of the Week&quot; includes an example adventure in which three Mongolian Death Worms hatch from a crate of museum samples, and will begin multiplying rapidly if not caught by the hunters.
*&quot;Dark Souls III&quot; features a miniboss inspired by the cryptid, the Carthus Sand Worm, located in Smouldering Lake.
*&quot;Death Worm&quot; is the name for a Mongolian warlord and enemy of Michelangelo in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; Roninverse setting by IDW Publishing.
* contains a creature in its expansion &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; called the &quot;Death Worm&quot; with an in game scientific name of &quot;Khorkoi Arrakis&quot; alluding to both The Mongolian Death Worm and the Sandworm from Dune.

<doc id="567017" wikidata="Q4116184" url="?curid=567017" title="Speak Good English Movement">
<text>The Speak Good English Movement (SGEM) is a Singapore Government campaign to &quot;encourage Singaporeans to speak grammatically correct English that is universally understood&quot;. It was launched by then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong on 29 April 2000. The purpose was to ensure that Singaporeans recognise the importance of speaking Standard English and to encourage its usage. It is seen as a measure to counter the usage of Singapore Colloquial English, known as Singlish.

==Background==
English was introduced in 1819 with the establishment of the modern port in Singapore. The port attracted migrants from neighbouring countries, such as China and India, resulting in a diverse linguistic landscape. Proximity to these languages has over generations influenced Singaporean English. Known colloquially as Singlish, the vernacular dialect is characterised by the mixture of local expressions with Standard English (e.g. the use of discourse particles such as &quot;&quot;). Singlish is commonly used by Singaporeans in informal contexts and can be incomprehensible to non-Singaporeans.

When the Speak Good English Movement was launched in 1999, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong described Singlish as &quot;English corrupted by Singaporeans&quot;, and &quot;broken, ungrammatical English&quot;. According to the government, mastery of Standard English is imperative to raise living standards in Singapore, and Singlish causes problems when Singaporeans need to communicate in the &quot;global language of commerce, business and technology&quot;. The movement thus campaigns for an improved standard of English used in Singapore. In hopes of extending its reach, the movement adopts a different theme and target group each year, and also collaborates with various partner organisations to provide programmes in line with the movement&#x27;s goals.

==Aims==
The campaign aims to discourage the use of Singlish and encourage the use of a more standardised form of English, (i.e. generally modelled on the British standard). According to the movement&#x27;s chairman, then Colonel (NS) David Wong, the Speak Good English Movement aims to build a sense of pride that Singaporeans can speak good English, as opposed to Singlish, as well as to check the trend where Singaporeans use Singlish as a way of identifying themselves. Instead, it envisions a brand of grammatically correct English, different from Singlish, to be linked with the unique Singaporean identity.

==Past themes==
Since 2003, the Speak Good English Movement has been launched annually with year-long programmes and activities held island-wide to increase the awareness among Singaporeans that speaking good English matters in their daily lives. Each year a different theme focusing on the target audience is created. The themes that were used in the campaign up until 2015 are:

* 2000–2004: Speak Well. Be Understood.
* 2005–06: Speak Up. Speak Out. Speak Well.
* 2006–07: Be Understood. Not only in Singapore, Malaysia and Batam.
* 2007–08: Rock Your World! Express Yourself.
* 2008–09: I Can
* 2009–10: Impress. Inspire. Intoxicate.
* 2010–11: Get It Right
* 2011–12: How You Speak Makes a Difference
* 2012–13: Make Good English Stick
* 2013–14: 10 Tips to Improve Your English
* 2014-16: Grammar Rules Matter. Use Good English.
* 2017–18: Learn Grammar Rules to Rule the English Language
* 2019: Let&#x27;s Connect. Let&#x27;s Speak Good English.

=== 2000–2004 : Speak Well. Be Understood. ===
In 1999, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong highlighted the problem of speaking Singlish in his National Day Rally. A year later in April 2000, he officially launched the Speak Good English Movement with the tagline &#x27;Speak Well, Be Understood&#x27;. He stressed the importance of speaking standard English and reducing the use of Singlish, as Singapore is a hub city and an open economy with a need to interact with English-speaking foreigners. Singaporeans often use Chinese syntax and literal translations of Chinese phrases while speaking English, which make utterances seem truncated and incomprehensible to foreigners. In his rally, the prime minister stressed that &quot;if we speak a corrupted form of English that is not understood by others, we will lose a key competitive advantage.&quot; The movement was spearheaded by a committee of people in the private sector led by then Colonel (NS) David Wong, a senior adviser with the consulting company Ernst and Young. Its target audience was Singaporeans under 40, which included young working adults, parents and students in schools, tertiary institutes, polytechnics and technical institutes. The launch kick-started a week-long festival packed with events such as plays and a speech marathon.

Later in the year, the public sector also organised year-long programmes as part of the movement. One such event was the seminar held by the Singapore Teachers&#x27; Union (STU) at the Shangri-La Hotel, attended by about 500 participants who were mostly teachers. The seminar emphasised the power of pronunciation and the teaching of grammar, and encouraged teachers to teach English in more creative ways in schools using dramas and role-playing. Other highlights in 2000 included the launch of &quot;Grammar Matters&quot;, a series of five books using comics to illustrate the correct use of grammar by the Regional English Language Centre in support of the movement.

From 2001 to 2002, it was reported that increasingly, Singaporeans were becoming more aware and acknowledging the importance of speaking good English. The British Council continued to operate its toll-free line giving English lessons. Reportedly, year 2001 saw almost 250,000 callers while there were about 170,000 callers in 2002. Also, an inter-school Scrabble competition, in which 54 primary schools participated, was held to kick off the year&#x27;s events in April 2002.

According to the Government, more Singaporeans recognised the need to speak well, and took steps to improve their spoken English. Programmes organised by SGEM partners such as the People&#x27;s Association and the British Council were well received.

In 2003, the movement, already in its fourth year, aimed to not only encourage Singaporeans to speak well but also speak simple English. Chairman Wong said, &quot;They may be afraid to use English; it&#x27;s not natural to them. This year what we would like to do is encourage people to try. Have a go even if they can&#x27;t speak well, even if they cannot use long words, even if they can&#x27;t use long sentences; it&#x27;s not important. The idea is to use simple words, simple sentences and convey their message clearly.&quot; The movement continued throughout the year until March 2004 so as to create greater impact and awareness.

In its fifth year, acting Manpower Minister Ng Eng Hen launched the campaign at The Arts House at Old Parliament in April 2004. The target of the campaign can be summed up as English@Work&amp;Play. Its target audience was working adults in the service industry, including cabbies, shop assistants, waiters and others, which made up 70 per cent of all workers in Singapore. People in positions of influence, parents and teachers were also encouraged to serve as positive role models in speaking good English to those around them. The movement also partnered organisations and key agencies in training workshop initiatives to improve the English language proficiency of all their teachers. A new programme called &quot;Functional Literacy for Our Workers&quot; (FLOW) was initiated by the Workforce Development Agency with the aim to equip workers who had little English literacy with some basic tools required for them to do their work. Other activities to promote good English were also held throughout the year, such as the WISH programme (as in the previous year), and talks at selected public libraries to educate the public on the importance of reading aloud and on using English to communicate with one&#x27;s family.

==== Partner programmes ====

Booths were set up to allow enrolment for English classes as well.

=== 2005–06 : Speak Up. Speak Out. Speak Well. ===

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong launched that year&#x27;s Speak Good English Movement on 13 May at the HDB Hub Auditorium at Toa Payoh. Chairing the movement was Professor Koh Tai Ann, professor of English Literature at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Nanyang Technological University. Professor Koh highlighted that speaking good English did not necessarily mean that one should seek to eradicate or diminish the usage of Singlish or mother tongue. He recognised the importance of mother tongue and Singlish as a bonding element for Singaporeans, but emphasised that there was a right place and time for it and that Singaporeans must be able to converse in Standard English when an occasion called for it. The highlights of that year&#x27;s movement included the appointment of 12 ambassadors for the SGEM 2005. They included taxi drivers, cyber gamers and media personalities.

&quot;Partner programmes in 2005–06&quot;

=== 2006–07 : Be Understood. Not only in Singapore, Malaysia and Batam ===

The 2006 movement was launched by Radm (NS) Lui Tuck Yew, Minister of State For Education on 25 July 2006 at The Plaza, National Library Building.

The highlights of the 2006 movement include starting of the &#x27;English as it is Broken&#x27; column in the Generation Y page of The Sunday Times which addressed questions relating to English sent in by its readers. This column continued its run for two years in print and was later adapted to a regularly updated online column on STOMP which still runs today. There have also been daily enquiries regarding English language on STOMP. Its popularity led to the publication of two best-selling volumes of books of the same title- &#x27;English As It is Broken&#x27;, based on issues brought up from the site.

Launched by Minister Lim Boon Heng, Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, on 26 August 2008, the Speak Good English Movement 2008 targeted the workforce who were seen as the people both Singaporeans and international visitors would encounter most frequently. Frontline staff of the service and retail sectors were especially targeted.
The message of the tagline of 2008 – &#x27;I Can&#x27; was that &#x27;I can help others improve their English.&#x27;, &#x27;I can take action to improve my English.&#x27; and &#x27;I can speak good English if I want to.&#x27; In order to encourage willingness to speak and improve their proficiency of Standard English, the movement of this year initiated the classification of Singaporeans into three categories: 1. Singaporeans who can speak Standard English. 2. Singaporeans who cannot yet speak Standard English and are open to improving themselves. 3. Singaporeans who are not able to speak Standard English and do not see the importance of doing so.

=== 2010–11 : Get it Right ===

In its 11th year, the Speak Good English Movement 2010 which was launched on 7 September 2010 with the tagline &#x27;Get It Right&#x27;. This year&#x27;s focus is on those who are less proficient in Standard English. It aimed at broadening the environment in which Standard English is used, in order to create a conducive environment where those less proficient in the code can learn by example. Fluent speakers of Standard English are encouraged to use it more frequently in all conversation, regardless if it is with family members, colleagues, hawkers, or taxi drivers.

==== Activist toolkit ====
In a bid for Singaporeans to &#x27;Get It Right&#x27;-where those proficient in Standard English take note to use the language accurately and those who are less proficient at it try to use it correctly; the organisers introduced an Activist Toolkit. The Activist Toolkit includes sticky notes, stickers and notebooks. People are encouraged to use the sticky notes to correct English errors that they encounter anywhere. For example, correcting a wrongly expressed sign by pasting a sticky note over it. This tactic is called &#x27;guerrilla-styled&#x27; from guerrilla marketing. The current Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan kicked off this year&#x27;s campaign by being the first to correct a sign at the Xin Food Court at the HarbourFront Centre. He replaced an ungrammatical sign saying &#x27;No outside food allowed&#x27; with a one which reads &#x27;No food from elsewhere, please&#x27;.

With the new appointment of a new chairman after ten years and the formation of a new committee, a new campaign was rolled out on 14 June 2019. Mr. Jason Leow, chairman of Speak Good English Movement, says the movement recognises Singlish as a &quot;cultural marker for many Singaporeans&quot;, but good English has value in &quot;promoting understanding, supports business communication and helps us be understood by others wherever English is spoken – internationally and in Singapore.&quot;

The logo is a quotation mark symbolising a person in conversation, with the new tagline &#x27;Let&#x27;s connect. Let&#x27;s speak good English.&#x27;

==Criticism==
The SGEM has received mixed reactions from its beginning; its strongest opponents have included linguists and social commentators. In response, Liew Choon Boon, Director of the Arts &amp; Heritage Development Division from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts and Ho Peng, Director of Curriculum Planning and Development from the Ministry of Education, wrote in a letter published in &quot;The Straits Times&quot; on 12 December 2008:
=== Singlish as a marker of Singaporean identity ===

The Speak Good English Movement is the government&#x27;s effort to encourage Singaporeans to speak Standard English rather than the colloquial form, Singlish. Many Singaporeans have criticised this as trying to eradicate Singlish. Arguing that Singlish is a distinctive marker of Singaporean identity, supporters of Singlish criticise SGEM. Their support for Singlish stems from the belief that Singlish can forge social cohesion and according to some, &quot;It may be the only thing that makes us Singaporean.&quot; Likewise, celebrity STOMP blogger Leow Ju Len says in this blog post: 

====Save Our Singlish Campaign====
On 27 April 2002, two years after the start of SGEM, TalkingCock launched the Save Our Singlish Campaign. They made it clear at the speech during the launch that they did not oppose the speaking of good English. Rather, they &quot;completely support the writing and speaking of good English&quot; and hoped that SGEM would see the Save Our Singlish Campaign &quot;as complementary, not adversarial&quot;. TalkingCock found it important to save Singlish for it is a crucial part of the Singaporean culture and heritage:

Furthermore, they reiterated that &quot;Singlish is not just broken English. It&#x27;s a patois.&quot; They argued that speaking good English should not be promoted at the expense of Singlish. &quot;Singapore Watch&quot; summed it up with &quot;Speak Singlish proudly, speak English properly.&quot; Colin Goh, who started TalkingCock, pointed out that Singaporeans can tell the difference between English and Singlish:

He further acknowledged that there are times when improper English is spoken by Singaporeans but reiterated that the blame cannot be pushed onto Singlish:
In an event held on 24 August 2006, &quot;TalkingCock in Parliament: We, the Citizens&quot;, Ruby Pan (a former Ministry of Education scholar and a graduate of Princeton University) displayed the ability to switch easily from Standard English to Singlish and to different English accents.

====Speak Good Singlish Movement====
The Speak Good Singlish Movement gathers support through a Facebook page which had 252 members though as reported in a dead link, an identically named group had 3,140 members in December 2012. It began as a response to the launch of SGEM 2010, in particular, its notion of using post-its to correct public signs written in poor English. The page ran its own post-it campaign, called the &quot;Post-its Tak Bak Chew Campaign&quot;, inviting supporters to send in snapshots of their own home-made signs with proper Singlish.

The original Facebook page was established on 11 September 2010 with the following statements:

In an exclusive interview with The Online Citizen, one of Singapore&#x27;s key social commentary websites, its unnamed founder directly called into question Dr Balakrishnan&#x27;s appeal about the SGEM.

===Hiring &quot;native&quot; English speakers to teach===
Since Singapore gained independence in 1965, English is taught as a first language and is also the most dominant language in Singapore. All public schools use English as the medium of instruction. But one cannot classify all Singaporeans as native speakers of English because the main languages spoken at home are not necessarily English. In 2006, then Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam mentioned during a dialogue session at a student education conference that his ministry was looking at hiring &quot;native speakers&quot; to teach English language in schools in order to improve the standard of teaching the English language in school. Following this, many Singaporeans wrote in to newspapers forums with questions such as &quot;Why aren&#x27;t our English teachers suitably qualified?&quot; and wondering if &quot;native English speakers&quot; meant foreign English-speakers hailing from the United States or from Britain.

On 14 June 2006, mrbrown reported in his blog that the Ministry of Education had already put up job advertisements in the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; for experienced, qualified native speakers of English to teach English as a first language, English literature, geography, history, knowledge and inquiry.

Subsequently, mrbrown created two podcasts on the mrbrown show to express his views. The first gave insight to what will happen if the implementation of hiring foreign native English speakers to teach English became too successful. The second tells of how he imagines the interviews with the native speaker applicants for the teaching jobs.

In response, Jennifer Chan, Press Secretary to Minister for Education, wrote in a forum letter reply dated 22 June 2006 that:

The hiring of &quot;a small number&quot; of foreign teachers was to complement the local teachers in subjects like English, the Mother Tongue Languages and the humanities. This formed part of the plan to bring the standard of English languages in schools to a higher level.

===The &quot;interference&quot; argument===
Drawing from notions of linguistic interference, the &quot;interference&quot; argument justifies the need to eliminate Singlish by suggesting that it confuses and contaminates Standard English. It suggests that the inability to distinguish the grammars of the two varieties of English will cause learners to mix their features, thus contaminating the grammar of the standard version.

However, many Singaporeans feel that Singlish is unlikely to negatively affect their proficiency in Standard English. In a 2008 study, about 41% of the Singaporean participants felt that they already have a good command of English. Another study by Wee (2005) has shown that in general, Singaporeans are confident in their code-switching abilities between Singlish and Standard English, which undermines the claims that using Singlish interferes with the learning of Standard English.

<text>Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks. Hashcash was proposed in 1997 by Adam Back and described more formally in Back&#x27;s 2002 paper &quot;Hashcash – A Denial of Service Counter-Measure&quot;. In Hashcash the client has to concatenate a random number with a string several times and hash this new string. It then has to do so over and over until a hash beginning with a certain number of zeros is found.

==Background==
The idea &quot;...to require a user to compute a moderately hard, but not intractable function...&quot; was proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in their 1992 paper &quot;Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail&quot;.

==How it works==
Hashcash is a cryptographic hash-based proof-of-work algorithm that requires a selectable amount of work to compute, but the proof can be verified efficiently. For email uses, a textual encoding of a hashcash stamp is added to the header of an email to prove the sender has expended a modest amount of CPU time calculating the stamp prior to sending the email. In other words, as the sender has taken a certain amount of time to generate the stamp and send the email, it is unlikely that they are a spammer. The receiver can, at negligible computational cost, verify that the stamp is valid. However, the only known way to find a header with the necessary properties is brute force, trying random values until the answer is found; though testing an individual string is easy, satisfactory answers are rare enough that it will require a substantial number of tries to find the answer.

The hypothesis is that spammers, whose business model relies on their ability to send large numbers of emails with very little cost per message, will cease to be profitable if there is even a small cost for each spam they send. Receivers can verify whether a sender made such an investment and use the results to help filter email.

== Technical details ==
The header line looks something like this:
 X-Hashcash: 1:20:1303030600:adam@cypherspace.org::McMybZIhxKXu57jd:ckvi

The header contains:
* &quot;ver&quot;: Hashcash format version, 1 (which supersedes version 0).
* &quot;bits&quot;: Number of &quot;partial pre-image&quot; (zero) bits in the hashed code.
* &quot;date&quot;: The time that the message was sent, in the format .
* &quot;resource&quot;: Resource data string being transmitted, e.g., an IP address or email address.
* &quot;ext&quot;: Extension (optional; ignored in version 1).
* &quot;rand&quot;: String of random characters, encoded in base-64 format.
* &quot;counter&quot;: Binary counter, encoded in base-64 format.

The header contains the recipient&#x27;s email address, the date of the message, and information proving that the required computation has been performed. The presence of the recipient&#x27;s email address requires that a different header be computed for each recipient. The date allows the recipient to record headers received recently and to ensure that the header is unique to the email message.

===Sender&#x27;s side===
The sender prepares a header and appends a counter value initialized to a random number. It then computes the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the header. If the first 20 bits (i.e. the 5 most significant hex digits) of the hash are all zeros, then this is an acceptable header. If not, then the sender increments the counter and tries the hash again. Out of 2160 possible hash values, there are 2140 hash values that satisfy this criterion. Thus the chance of randomly selecting a header that will have 20 zeros as the beginning of the hash is 1 in 220 (approx. 106, or about one in a million). The number of times that the sender needs to try to get a valid hash value is modeled by geometric distribution. Hence the sender will on average have to try 220 values to find a valid header. Given reasonable estimates of the time needed to compute the hash, this would take about one second to find. No more efficient method than this brute force approach is known to find a valid header.

A normal user on a desktop PC would not be significantly inconvenienced by the processing time required to generate the Hashcash string. However, spammers would suffer significantly due to the large number of spam messages sent by them.

===Recipient&#x27;s side===
Technically the system is implemented with the following steps:
* The recipient&#x27;s computer calculates the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the entire string (e.g., ). This takes about two microseconds on a 1 GHz machine, far less time than the time it takes for the rest of the e-mail to be received. If the first 20 bits are not all zero, the hash is invalid. (Later versions may require more bits to be zero as machine processing speeds increase.)
* The recipient&#x27;s computer checks the date in the header (e.g., , which represents the date 8 Apr 2006). If it is not within two days of the current date, it is invalid. (The two-day window compensates for clock skew and network routing time between different systems.)
* The recipient&#x27;s computer checks whether the e-mail address in the hash string matches any of the valid e-mail addresses registered by the recipient, or matches any of the mailing lists to which the recipient is subscribed. If a match is not found, the hash string is invalid.
* The recipient&#x27;s computer inserts the hash string into a database. If the string is already in the database (indicating that an attempt is being made to re-use the hash string), it is invalid.

If the hash string passes all of these tests, it is considered a valid hash string. All of these tests take far less time and disk space than receiving the body content of the e-mail.

===Required effort===
The time needed to compute such a hash collision is exponential with the number of zero bits. So additional zero bits can be added (doubling the amount of time needed to compute a hash with each additional zero bit) until it is too expensive for spammers to generate valid header lines.

Confirming that the header is valid is much faster and always takes the same amount of time, no matter how many zero bits are required for a valid header, since this requires only a single hashing operation.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

The Hashcash system has the advantage over micropayment proposals applying to legitimate e-mail that no real money is involved. Neither the sender nor recipient need to pay, thus the administrative issues involved with any micropayment system and moral issues related to charging for e-mail are entirely avoided.

On the other hand, as Hashcash requires potentially significant computational resources to be expended on each e-mail being sent, it is somewhat difficult to tune the ideal amount of average time one wishes clients to expend computing a valid header. This can mean sacrificing accessibility from low-end embedded systems or else running the risk of hostile hosts not being challenged enough to provide an effective filter from spam.

Hashcash is also fairly simple to implement in mail user agents and spam filters. No central server is needed. Hashcash can be incrementally deployed—the extra Hashcash header is ignored when it is received by mail clients that do not understand it.

One plausible analysis concluded that only one of the following cases is likely: either non-spam e-mail will get stuck due to lack of processing power of the sender, or spam e-mail is bound to still get through. Examples of each include, respectively, a centralized e-mail topology (like a mailing list), in which some server is to send an enormous number of &quot;legitimate&quot; e-mails, and botnets or cluster farms with which spammers can increase their processing power enormously.

Most of these issues may be addressed. E.g., botnets may expire faster because users notice the high CPU load and take counter-measures, and mailing list servers can be registered in white lists on the subscribers&#x27; hosts and thus be relieved from the hashcash challenges.

Another projected problem is that computers continue to get faster according to Moore&#x27;s law. So the difficulty of the calculations required must be increased over time. However, developing countries can be expected to use older hardware, which means that they will find it increasingly difficult to participate in the e-mail system. This also applies to lower-income individuals in developed countries who cannot afford the latest hardware.

Like hashcash, cryptocurrencies use a hash function as their proof-of-work system. The rise of cryptocurrency has created a demand for ASIC-based mining machines. Although most cryptocurrencies use the SHA-256 hash function, the same ASIC technology could be used to create hashcash solvers that are three orders of magnitude faster than a consumer CPU, reducing the computational hurdle for spammers.

==Applications==
===Bitcoin mining===
In contrast to hashcash in mail applications that relies on recipients to set manually an amount of work intended to &quot;deter&quot; malicious senders, the Bitcoin cryptocurrency network employs a different hash-based proof-of-work challenge to &quot;enable&quot; competitive Bitcoin mining. A Bitcoin miner runs a computer program that collects unconfirmed transactions from users on the network. Together, these can form a &quot;block&quot; and earn a payment to the miner, but a block is only accepted by the network if its hash meets the network&#x27;s difficulty target. Thus, as in hashcash, miners must discover by brute force the &quot;nonce&quot; that, when included in the block, results in an acceptable hash.

Unlike hashcash, Bitcoin&#x27;s difficulty target does &quot;not&quot; specify a minimum number of leading zeros in the hash. Instead, the hash is interpreted as a (very large) integer, and this integer must be less than the target integer. This is necessary because the Bitcoin network must periodically adjust its difficulty level to maintain an average time of 10 minutes between successive blocks. If only leading zeros were considered, then the difficulty could only be doubled or halved, causing the adjustment to greatly overshoot or undershoot in response to small changes in the average block time. Still, the number of leading zeros in the target serves as a good approximation of the current difficulty. In January 2020, block #614525 had 74 leading zeros.

===Spam filters===
Hashcash was used as a potential solution for false positives with automated spam filtering systems, as legitimate users will rarely be inconvenienced by the extra time it takes to mine a stamp. SpamAssassin was able to check for Hashcash stamps since version 2.70 until version 3.4.2, assigning a negative score (i.e. less likely to be spam) for valid, unspent Hashcash stamps. However, although the hashcash plugin is on by default, it still needs to be configured with a list of address patterns that must match against the Hashcash resource field before it will be used. Support was removed from SpamAssassin&#x27;s trunk on 2019-06-26, affecting version 3.4.3 and beyond.

===Email clients===
The Penny Post software project on SourceForge implements Hashcash in the Mozilla Thunderbird email client. The project is named for the historical availability of conventional mailing services that cost the sender just one penny; see Penny Post for information about such mailing services in history.

===Email Postmark===
Microsoft also designed and implemented a now deprecated open specification called &quot;Email Postmark&quot;. It is similar to Hashcash. This was part of Microsoft&#x27;s Coordinated Spam Reduction Initiative (CSRI). The Microsoft email postmark variant of Hashcash is implemented in the Microsoft mail infrastructure components Exchange, Outlook, and Hotmail.
The format differences between Hashcash and Microsoft&#x27;s email postmark are that postmark hashes the body in addition to the recipient, uses a modified SHA-1 as the hash function, and uses multiple sub-puzzles to reduce proof of work variance.

===Blogs===
Like e-mail, blogs often fall victim to comment spam.
Some blog owners have used hashcash scripts written in the JavaScript language to slow down comment spammers. Some scripts (such as wp-hashcash) claim to implement hashcash but instead depend on JavaScript obfuscation to force the client to generate a matching key; while this does require some processing power, it does not use the hashcash algorithm or hashcash stamps.

=== Reputation ===
In a digital marketplace, service providers can use hashcash to build reputation to attract clients. To build reputation, a service provider first selects a public key as its ID, and then discovers by brute force a nonce that, when concatenated to the ID, results in a hash digest with several leading zeros. The more zeros, the higher the reputation.

==Intellectual property==
Hashcash is not patented, and the reference implementation and most of the other implementations are free software. Hashcash is included or available for many Linux distributions.

RSA has made IPR statements to the IETF about client-puzzles in the context of an RFC that described client-puzzles (not hashcash). The RFC included hashcash in the title and referenced hashcash, but the mechanism described in it is a known-solution interactive challenge which is more akin to Client-Puzzles; hashcash is non-interactive and therefore does not have a known solution. In any case RSA&#x27;s IPR statement can not apply to hashcash because hashcash predates (March 1997) the client-puzzles publication (February 1999) and the client-puzzles patent filing US7197639 (February 2000).

<doc id="567024" wikidata="Q995812" url="?curid=567024" title="Chris Davies (Liberal Democrat politician)">
<text>Christopher Graham Davies (born 7 July 1954) is a Liberal Democrat politician in the United Kingdom. He was a Member of Parliament for Littleborough and Saddleworth from 1995 to 1997. He served as a Member of the European Parliament for North West England from 1999 to 2014 and from 2019 to 2020.

==Biography==
Davies was born in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. His father was a doctor, and his mother a nurse. He was educated at the independent Cheadle Hulme School (1965–1972), at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge (1972–1975, reading history) and from 1975 to 1977 at the University of Kent, Canterbury.

Davies is a resident of Greenfield, in Saddleworth, Oldham, Greater Manchester.

==Political career==

===Local government===
Davies was a Liberal member of Liverpool City Council from 1980 to 1984, representing Abercromby ward and serving as Chairman of the Housing Committee. From 1994 to 1998 he was a Liberal Democrat councillor for Lees ward on Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council.

===Member of Parliament===
Davies contested Liverpool Scotland Exchange in 1979, and then Littleborough and Saddleworth in 1987 and 1992. He became the MP for that seat after a by-election in 1995, during which time Labour campaign manager Peter Mandelson branded him “...high on taxes and soft on drugs” for supporting Liberal Democrat policy on increasing income tax by 1p in the pound to provide additional funding for education, and to establish a Royal Commission to consider decriminalisation of cannabis. His election campaign was controversial due to Davies openly campaigning while the incumbent MP Geoffrey Dickens was dying from liver cancer.

The Littleborough and Saddleworth seat was abolished by the time of the 1997 General Election. Davies contested Oldham East and Saddleworth at the 1997 election but lost to Phil Woolas of Labour.

===European Parliament===
Davies was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for the North West England constituency in 1999 and served as the Liberal Democrat spokesman on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee (ENVI) in the European Parliament.

In March 2014 he won a parliamentarian of the year award for his work to promote sustainable fishing through Fish for the Future, an all-party group he created in 2010. His efforts included dressing as a fish in the European Parliament to raise awareness of the need for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). He lost his seat in the 2014 European election.

During his time as an MEP, Davies was active in the environment, climate and energy policy sectors, and served as the ALDE coordinator (team leader) on the ENVI committee from 2007.
He was the rapporteur for the Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide (Carbon capture and storage, CCS) Directive in 2008-9 and for the implementation report on CCS in 2013–14, which called for greater action to develop and deploy CCS in the EU. In 2008 he drafted an amendment that led to the creation of a funding mechanism for CCS and innovative renewable energy projects that became known as NER300, later described by the European Commission as one of the world&#x27;s largest funding programmes for innovative low-carbon energy demonstration projects.

Davies was elected for a second time as a MEP representing the Liberal Democrats at the 2019 European Parliament election for the North West England constituency. His term ended eight months later when the United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020.

==Controversies==

Davies served as the Liberal Democrat spokesman on the environment and public health in the European Parliament.

In 2006, Davies was forced to resign as leader of the Liberal Democrats group in the European Parliament, due to the tone of a series of emails he exchanged with a Jewish constituent. Davies accused a Jewish constituent of &quot;wallowing in your own filth&quot;; accused Israel of &quot;posing as a victim&quot; while pursuing &quot;racist policies of apartheid&quot; and had written &quot;I shall denounce the influence of the Jewish lobby that seems to have far too great a say over the political decision-making process in many countries.&quot; Party Leader Sir Menzies Campbell called his comments &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

In 2008, Davies made some widely publicised comments on an unpublished report which, he claimed, contained evidence of &quot;embezzlement and fraud&quot; among EU parliament members.

At the autumn 2009 Liberal Democrat conference in Bournemouth, Davies made a speech in a debate about the MP expenses scandal, where he appeared to become very angry, saying: &quot;I hate the dirty cheating bastards who have taken every opportunity to fill their private pockets with public money … they should play no part in public life&quot;. He went on the implore his Liberal Democrat colleagues to &quot;Publish everything, reveal all, hide nothing.&quot;

<text>George Mackay Brown (17 October 1921 – 13 April 1996) was a Scottish poet, author and dramatist with a distinctly Orcadian character. He is widely regarded as one of the great Scottish poets of the 20th century.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
George Mackay Brown was born on 17 October 1921, the youngest of six children. His parents were John Brown, a tailor and postman, and Mhairi Mackay, a descendant of Clan Mackay who had been brought up in Braal, a hamlet near Strathy, Sutherland, as a native speaker of the Reay Country dialect of Scottish Gaelic.

Except for periods as a mature student in mainland Scotland, Brown lived all his life in the town of Stromness on Mainland, Orkney. One of his Stromness neighbours was his friend the artist Sylvia Wishart. Because of illness, his father was restricted in his work and he received no pension. The family had a history of depression and Brown&#x27;s uncle, Jimmy Brown, may have died by suicide: his body was found in Stromness harbour in 1935. George Mackay Brown&#x27;s youth was spent in poverty. During that period he contracted tuberculosis.

Brown&#x27;s illness kept him from entering the army at the start of the Second World War and affected him so badly he could not live a normal working life. However, this gave him time and space in which to write. He started work in 1944 with &quot;The Orkney Herald&quot;, writing on Stromness news, and soon became a prolific journalist. He was encouraged in writing poetry by Francis Scarfe, who was billeted in the Browns&#x27; house for over a year from April 1944. After that he was helped in developing as a writer by Ernest Marwick, whose criticism he valued, and by Robert Rendall.

Brown&#x27;s weekly &quot;Island Diary&quot; appeared in the &quot;Herald&quot; between 1945 and 1956. He used the pen name &quot;Islandman&quot; for the column. He was sometimes portrayed by &quot;Spike&quot; (Bob Johnston), the paper&#x27;s cartoonist, wearing a prominent scarf in the regular Spotlight comic strip. The loss of the scarf on a trip to Shetland was described in 1951. The &quot;now almost legendary scarf&quot; was returned and put on display in a Stromness shop window. Jo Grimond, the local MP, said &quot;the scarf should be retained as permanent inter-county trophy,&quot; but Brown complained that &quot;they hadn&#x27;t even washed it&quot;. Spike described it as &quot;the scarf that launched 1,000 quips&quot;.

In 1947, Stromness voted to allow pubs to open again, the town having been &quot;dry&quot; since the 1920s. When the first bar opened in 1948, Mackay Brown first tasted alcohol. He found alcoholic drinks &quot;a revelation; they flushed my veins with happiness; they washed away all cares and shyness and worries. I remember thinking to myself &#x27;If I could have two pints of beer every afternoon, life would be a great happiness&#x27;&quot;. Alcohol played a considerable part in his life, but he says, &quot;I never became an alcoholic, mainly because my guts quickly stalled.&quot;

===Higher education and beginnings as poet===
Brown was a mature student at Newbattle Abbey College in the 1951–1952 session, where the poet Edwin Muir, who had a great influence on his life as a writer, was warden. His return for the following session was interrupted by recurrent tuberculosis.

Having had poems published in several periodicals, his first volume of them, &quot;The Storm&quot;, appeared with the Orkney Press in 1954. Muir wrote in the foreword: &quot;Grace is what I find in these poems.&quot;. Only three hundred copies were printed, and the imprint sold out within a fortnight. It was acclaimed in the local press.

Brown studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh. After publication of poems in a literary magazine, with the help of Muir, Brown had a second volume, &quot;Loaves and Fishes&quot;, published by the Hogarth Press in 1959. It was warmly received.

During this period he met many of the Scottish poets of his time – Sydney Goodsir Smith, Norman MacCaig, Hugh MacDiarmid, Tom Scott and others – with whom he often drank in Rose Street, Edinburgh. Here he also met Stella Cartwright, described as &quot;The Muse in Rose Street&quot;. Brown was briefly engaged to her and began a correspondence that continued until her death in 1985.

In late 1960, Brown commenced teacher training at Moray House College of Education, but ill health prevented him remaining in Edinburgh. On his recovery in 1961, he found he was not suited to teaching and returned late in the year to his mother&#x27;s house in Stromness, unemployed. At this juncture he was received into the Roman Catholic Church, converting from Presbyterianism of his childhood being baptised on 23 December and taking communion the next day. This followed about 25 years of pondering his religious beliefs. The conversion was not marked by any change in his daily habits, including his drinking.

===Maturity as poet===

After a period of unemployment and rejection of a volume of his poetry by the Hogarth Press, Brown did a postgraduate study on Gerard Manley Hopkins, although such work was not to his taste. This provided some occupation and income until 1964, when a volume of poetry, &quot;The Year of the Whale&quot;, was accepted.

Brown now found himself able to support himself financially for the first time, as he received new commissions. He received a bursary from the Scottish Arts Council in December 1965 as he was working on the volume of short stories, &quot;A Calendar of Love&quot;, which was issued to critical acclaim in February 1967. He was still troubled by excessive drinking, and that of Stella Cartwright. Later that year came the death of his mother, who had supported him despite disapproving of his drinking; she left an estate of £4.

Meanwhile, he had been working on &quot;An Orkney Tapestry&quot;, which includes essays on Orkney and more imaginative pieces, illustrated by Sylvia Wishart. The year 1968 also saw his one visit to Ireland, on a bursary from the Society of Authors. He met Seamus Heaney there, although his nervous condition reduced his ability to enjoy the visit.

In 1969, his short-story collection &quot;A Time to Keep&quot; received a positive welcome. The poet Charles Causley said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know anyone writing in this particular genre today who comes within a thousand miles of him.&quot; This was also the year in which he finished working on a six-part cycle of poems about Rackwick, published in 1971 as &quot;Fishermen with Ploughs&quot;. Meanwhile, &quot;An Orkney Tapestry&quot; was proving to be a commercial success.

By the late 1960s Brown&#x27;s poetry was renowned internationally, so that the American poet Robert Lowell, for example, came to Orkney expressly to meet him.

During the summer of 1970, Brown met the musician Peter Maxwell Davies in Rackwick. Subsequently, Davies, who came to live in Rackwick, based a number of his works on the poetry and prose of George Mackay Brown.

Brown was now working on his first novel &quot;Greenvoe&quot;, the story of an imaginary Orkney community menaced by an undefined project called &#x27;Operation Black Star&#x27;. The characters, with one exception, are not portrayed in any psychological depths. The exception is Mrs Mckee, mother of the (alcoholic) minister; Brown had intended her to be a minor character but he said of her, &quot;I grew to love her more and more as the novel unfolded&quot;. &quot;The Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot; says that &quot;Greenvoe&quot; &quot;ranks ... among the great prose poems of this century&quot;. When the novel was published in May 1972 it appeared prophetic because of the oil exploration beginning in the Orkney area. Brown found the resultant degree of celebrity a trial.

The story of Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney was one to which Brown frequently turned, and it was the theme of his next novel, &quot;Magnus&quot;, published in 1973. St Magnus&#x27;s life is told in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;. The novel examined the themes of sanctity and self-sacrifice. Brown takes the theme of sacrifice into the 20th century by inserting in journalistic language an account of the death of Dietrich Bonhoeffer. While some critics see the work as &quot;disjointed&quot;, Peter Maxwell Davies, for example, marks it as Brown&#x27;s greatest achievement and used it as the basis of his opera &quot;The Martyrdom of St Magnus&quot;.

Brown was awarded an OBE in the 1974 New Year Honours. The period after completing &quot;Magnus&quot;, however, was marked by one of Brown&#x27;s acute periods of mental distress. Yet he maintained a stream of writing: poetry, children&#x27;s stories, and a weekly column in the local newspaper, &quot;The Orcadian&quot;, which ran from 1971 to the end of his life. A first selection of them appeared as &quot;Letter from Hamnavoe&quot; in 1975.

In mid-1976, Brown met Nora Kennedy, a Viennese woman jeweller and silversmith who was moving to South Ronaldsay. They had a brief affair and remained friends for the rest of his life. He said in early 1977 that this had been his most productive winter as a writer.

===Later life and death===
By early 1977, he was entering a period of depression which lasted intermittently for almost a decade, but maintained his working routine throughout. He also had severe bronchial problems, his condition becoming so serious that in early 1981 he was given the Last Sacraments.

These years saw him working on &quot;Time in a Red Coat&quot;, a novel Brown called &quot;more a sombre fable&quot;, a meditation on the passage of time. It has been called &quot;a novel in which the poet&quot; – Brown as poet – &quot;assumes an undoubted authority.&quot;

Two of the important women in Brown&#x27;s life died about this time. Norah Smallwood, who had worked for his publishers Chatto &amp; Windus and helped and encouraged him over the years, died in 1984. The other was Stella Cartwright, who died the next year. It was after her death that Brown began &quot;For the Islands I Sing&quot;, an autobiography not published until after his death. where Cartwright receives more space than any other individual, although he did not attend her funeral.

Brown later formed an intense, platonic attachment to Kenna Crawford, to whom he dedicated &quot;The Golden Bird: Two Orkney Stories&quot; and some poems in the volume &quot;The wreck of the Archangel&quot;. She bore a strong resemblance to Stella Cartwright. &quot;The Golden Bird&quot; won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

Between 1987 and 1989, Brown travelled to Nairn, including a visit to Pluscarden Abbey, to Shetland and to Oxford, making it the longest time he had left Orkney since his earlier studies in Edinburgh. The Oxford visit coincided with the centenary of the death of Gerard Manley Hopkins.

Shortly afterwards, Brown was diagnosed with bowel cancer, which required two major operations in 1990 and a lengthy stay in Foresterhill Hospital, Aberdeen. In his final years Brown wrote two more novels, &quot;Vinland&quot; and &quot;Beside the Ocean of Time&quot;. &quot;Vinland&quot;, which won Brown a £1,000 award from the Scottish Arts Council, traces the life of Ranald Sigmundson, a fictional character from the Viking era. &quot;Beside the Ocean of Time&quot; covers over 800 years of Orkney history through the dreams of an Orkney schoolboy. It meditates on the nature of time. It won the Saltire Scottish Book of the Year Award for 1994 and was listed for the Booker Prize for Fiction, which caused Brown acute anxiety.

During his last years Brown remained in his home, cared for by a network of friends, including Surinder Punjya (later principal of the Nesbitt Centre, Hong Kong), Gunnie Moberg, and Renée Simm. He continued working, writing the poems of &quot;Following a Lark&quot; and preparing the book for publication. The first copies were delivered to his home on the day he died, 13 April 1996, after a short illness. He was buried on 16 April, the feast day of Saint Magnus, with a funeral service at Kirkwall&#x27;s St Magnus Cathedral, presided over by Father Mario Conti, Father Michael Spencer, and his later biographer Ron Ferguson. Peter Maxwell Davies played &quot;Farewell to Stromness&quot;. His gravestone quotes the last two lines of his 1996 poem, &quot;A work for poets&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt; Carve the runes
 Then be content with silence.&lt;/poem&gt;
In 2005, a memorial plaque to Brown was unveiled at the Writers&#x27; Museum in the Royal Mile, Edinburgh. It bears a quotation from his best-known poem, &quot;Hamnavoe&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt; In the fire of images
 Gladly I put my hand.&#x27;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Legacy ==
The 2021 centenary of Brown&#x27;s birth was marked by various events in Orkney and elsewhere in Scotland. In October, the Orkney Museum held an exhibition in Kirkwall marking Brown&#x27;s life and work. It was called &quot;Beside the Ocean of Time&quot;, after his last novel. The University of the Highlands and Islands created a collection of texts displayed as a digital &#x27;wondrous scarf&#x27; during Book Week Scotland. The idea was inspired by Brown&#x27;s colourful scarf.

Much of Brown&#x27;s personal and literary archive is held by the National Library of Scotland, including his diaries and extensive collections of his correspondence.

==Work==
Brown&#x27;s poetry and prose have been seen as characterised by &quot;the absence of frills and decoration; the lean simplicity of description, colour, shape and action reduced to essentials, which heightens the reality of the thing observed,&quot; while &quot;his poems became informed by a unique voice that was his alone, controlled and dispassionate, which allowed every word to play its part in the narrative scheme of the unfolding poem.&quot;

Brown gained most inspiration from his native islands, for poems, stories and novels that ranged over time. He drew on the Icelandic &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;, especially in his novel &quot;Magnus&quot;. Seamus Heaney said Brown&#x27;s works transformed life by &quot;passing everything through the eye of the needle of Orkney&quot;.

==Biographies==
His autobiography, &quot;For the Islands I Sing&quot;, appeared shortly after his death. A literary biography, &quot;Interrogation of Silence&quot; by Rowena Murray and Brian Murray, ensued in 2004, &quot;George Mackay Brown: The Life&quot;, a more personal biography by Maggie Fergusson, in 2006, and &quot;George Mackay Brown: The Wound and the Gift&quot; by Ron Ferguson, a study of Brown&#x27;s spiritual journey including his controversial move from Presbyterianism to Roman Catholicism, in 2011. &quot;The Seed Beneath the Snow&quot; by Joanna Ramsey, a personal memoir by a friend, was published in 2015.

<text>Colleville-Montgomery (; formerly &quot;Colleville-sur-Orne&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northern France. It was known as Colleville-sur-Orne until 13 June 1946 to distinguish it from another town in the department, also in a coastal location, Colleville-sur-Mer. The new name honoured Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, the senior-ranking British military commander who commanded the invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944. There are two neighbouring towns in Calvados called Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery and Saint-Germain-de-Montgommery, but they are named for Montgomery&#x27;s family ancestors. They were part of William the Conqueror&#x27;s invading army in 1066 and settled in England. The town was featured in the 1962 film, &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, detailing the French Resistance and their efforts on D-Day.

==Sights==
* The Church
Built by Saint-Vigor, Bishop of the city of Bayeux (511-531), during the 11th and 12th centuries, it has two choirs and a Romanesque nave.

The first bay consists in barrel vaults. The other vaults are more recent, built at the same time as the arches which lead to the second choir, from the thirteenth century.

The side tower from the twelfth century for the lower part is of Romanesque design, and from the fifteenth century for the upper part with a terrace on top surrounded by a parapet, and contains three bells. The bell tower, partially destroyed during the liberation of the area, was reconstructed.

The windows were designed in the style of Gothic architecture and their stained glass were restored after World War II.

* Hillman Fortress
Built by the German army in 1942, it consists of a complex of bunkers which are being restored since 1990 by an association called &quot;Les Amis du Suffolk Régiment&quot;.
Free guided visits are organised during the summer.
* La Redoute
Located at the end of Vauban street, this fortification was built in 1779 according to a design by Vauban. Half of it still remains visible.

==Tourism==
There is a camping place located about 200 m from the beach.

<text>Colleville-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Colleville on Sea&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department in Normandie region in northwestern France.

== History ==
It was originally a farm owned by a certain &quot;Koli&quot;, a Scandinavian settler in the Middle Ages. It shares the same etymology as the other Colleville in Normandy. During the conquest of England by William the Conqueror or following it, Gilbert de Colleville was given lands in Devon England, it was from this Knight that the modern de Colville/Colvin family would develop, also including Clan Colville in Scotland and the Barony de Colville, of Castle Bytham in England.

The beach next to the coastal village was one of the principal beachheads during the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, designated Omaha Beach.

<doc id="567044" wikidata="Q333729" url="?curid=567044" title="Jim Nicholson (Northern Ireland politician)">
<text>James Frederick Nicholson (born 29 January 1945) is a Northern Irish Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician, who served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Northern Ireland from 1989 to 2019.

Prior to his election to the European Parliament, Nicholson had been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newry and Armagh from 1983 until his defeat in the by-elections of 1986, when he and others resigned and stood again to protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement; Nicholson lost his seat to Seamus Mallon of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the only seat to be lost.

==Career==
Nicholson was born in 1945 in Armagh, Northern Ireland. Educated locally, he later worked as a farmer on the family farm. He joined the Ulster Unionist Party in the early 1970s and was the Secretary/Organiser of Mid-South Armagh Unionist Association from 1973 to 1983. He was elected to his first public office in 1976 as a member of Armagh council; he served until 1997 and was chairman of the council in 1994–95. From 1982 to 1986, Nicholson was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

===Westminster===
Nicholson was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Newry and Armagh in the 1983 general election for the UUP. At Westminster, he served on the Agriculture Select Committee. Along with all other unionist MPs, he resigned from the House of Commons in December 1985 as part of a wider protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement of that year and to secure a renewed mandate from their electors. A by-election to fill his seat took place in January 1986.

Nicholson, who was defending the nationalist-majority Newry and Armagh constituency in the by-election, was the only resigning MP not to re-win his seat, losing it to Seamus Mallon of the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in the by-election. He contested the seat again at the 1987 general election but demographics in the area had shifted against unionism; nationalist and republican candidates have held it ever since.

===European Parliament===
At the 1989 election to the European Parliament, he was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for Northern Ireland. He retained this seat in 1994, 1999 and 2004 although never reaching a quota of first preference votes. On each occasion, he was re-elected with the help of transfers from other candidates, under Northern Ireland&#x27;s EU election system of proportional representation using the single transferable vote. In 2009, running as a Conservatives and Unionists candidate, he was elected second ahead of the Democratic Unionist Party, who for the first time failed to reach quota in a European Parliament election.

Nicholson was initially a member of the European People&#x27;s Party group in the European Parliament. In 1997, however, he transferred to the eurosceptic Independents for a Europe of Nations group. He served as vice-chairman of the group for two years. In 1999, he joined the European Democrats wing of the European People&#x27;s Party - European Democrats group, the largest group in the Parliament, a eurosceptic wing which also contained the UK&#x27;s Conservative MEPs. He was one of five Quaestors in the European Parliament, becoming the first ever MEP from Northern Ireland to hold such a senior position when elected on 21 July 2004; he was re-elected in 2007. In 2009, he was elected as a Conservatives and Unionists candidate and subsequently joined the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. He served on the European Parliament&#x27;s Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety between 2014 and 2017.

Nicholson describes himself as a &quot;euro-realist&quot;; he is opposed to the creation of a federal Europe and is against the adoption of the euro as the currency of the United Kingdom. He does, however, believe that the European Union has been good for Northern Ireland in relation to funding and infrastructure. In 2016, Nicholson voiced his concerns about the way in which the EU has changed since he first became an MEP.

He retired at the 2019 European Parliament election. His party lost the seat at the election to Naomi Long of the Alliance Party.

==Personal life==
Nicholson married Elizabeth Gibson in 1968 and had six sons and one daughter. His wife died in May 2015 after a long illness. His son, Sam Nicholson, was a councillor and deputy mayor for ABC Borough Council, and a candidate for the 2017, 2019 and 2024 general elections in Northern Ireland for the constituency of Newry and Armagh.

<text>The People&#x27;s Choice Awards is an American awards show, recognizing people in entertainment, voted online by the fans and general public. The show has been held annually since 1975, with the winners originally determined using Gallup Polls until a switch to online voting in 2005.

The awards were created by Bob Stivers, who produced the first show in 1975. The first awards recognized &quot;The Sting&quot; as Favorite Picture of 1974, Barbra Streisand as the year&#x27;s Favorite Film Actress, and John Wayne as its Favorite Film Actor. So far, Ellen DeGeneres and Taylor Swift are the most awarded people, with a total of 20 awards each.

In 1982, Stivers sold the People&#x27;s Choice Awards to Procter &amp; Gamble Productions (P&amp;G); under P&amp;G, the ceremony was broadcast by CBS, and Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s brands held exclusive national advertising time across the entire telecast.

In April 2017, the E! network announced that they had acquired the People&#x27;s Choice Awards. The ceremony was initially shifted from a January scheduling to November to reduce its proximity to the busier months of awards season, but this was reverted for 2024 with a move to February. Since 2021, the ceremony has aired on E!&#x27;s sister broadcast network NBC. In September 2023, NBC also began to host the People&#x27;s Choice Country Awards as a spin-off.

==Categories==
The award categories have varied over the years. For example, the 16th People&#x27;s Choice Awards had categories including Favorite All-Around Movie (&quot;Batman&quot;), and both a Favorite Movie Actor (Tom Cruise) and a World Favorite Movie Actor (Dustin Hoffman). At the 23rd People&#x27;s Choice Awards, Rob Reiner was named the People&#x27;s Choice Awards Honoree. The 32nd People&#x27;s Choice Awards (broadcast in January 2006) included categories such as Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;), Favorite Leading Lady (Reese Witherspoon), Favorite Tour (U2), and an award named after a Procter &amp; Gamble brand: Nice &#x27;n Easy Fans Favorite Hair (Faith Hill). In 2008, the People&#x27;s Choice Awards introduced a new category: Favorite Sci-Fi Show. The nominees were &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; was the first recipient of the award.

==Poll-based awards==
In the 20th century, the awards were based on results from Gallup polls. Each year, Gallup took a survey of different categories for favorite actor, actress, movie, artist, television program or group. The scope was unlimited—the public could choose whomever or whatever it liked. The results of the annual survey were announced in the form of the People&#x27;s Choice Awards. Since polls have margins of error, many years&#x27; awards have had ties in at least one category, when Gallup declared that the voting was so close that a single winner could not be chosen. For instance, in 2003, both &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; were recognized as Favorite Motion Picture.

==Switch to online voting==
The winners of the 31st People&#x27;s Choice Awards (on January 9, 2005) were decided by online voting rather than Gallup polls. The nominees submitted for Internet voting were selected using an unpublished process involving editors at &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the show&#x27;s production team and a panel of pop culture fans.

The nominees for the 32nd People&#x27;s Choice Awards were determined by the web research company Knowledge Networks, which took a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 to 54, with and without Internet access, to come up with the nominees. After being presented with a list of candidates determined by national ratings averages, box office grosses and album sales, they had the option to write in their favorites. Knowledge Networks recruits its panel by using a RDD phone recruitment method and provides a web TV and Internet access to households without Internet access enabling them to infer back to the entire population.

The nominees for the 2010 People&#x27;s Choice Awards were determined by the media research company Visible Measures, which specializes in measuring Internet video audience behavior. The announcement of this partnership stated, &quot;For the first time ever, the People&#x27;s Choice Awards has incorporated Internet video viewing data into the initial nominee selection process, depending on Visible Measures True Reach metrics to objectively measure online video popularity. [...] Visible Measures worked with the People&#x27;s Choice Awards to determine each potential nominees&#x27; popularity on a True Reach basis, a unique measure of the total audience that has been exposed to an online video campaign – regardless of how widely the campaign spreads or where it appears. To measure True Reach, Visible Measures deploys a robust and patented set of technologies with the goal of capturing the universe of Internet video viewership data in near real-time.&quot;

<text>The University of Houston Law Center is the law school of the University of Houston in Houston, Texas. Founded in 1947, the Law Center is one of 12 colleges of the University of Houston, a state university. It is accredited by the American Bar Association and is a member of the Association of American Law Schools. The law school&#x27;s facilities are located on the university&#x27;s 667-acre campus in southeast Houston.

The Law Center awards the Juris Doctor (J.D.) and Master of Laws (LL.M.) degrees. The law school ranked tied at 68th in the 2024 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; law school rankings, No. 6 in intellectual property law, No. 6 in part-time law and No. 9 in health law.

According to UHLC&#x27;s official 2023 ABA-required disclosures, 92.2% of the Class of 2023 was employed in some capacity, 85% obtained full-time, long-term, bar admission required employment (as attorneys), and 6.25% obtained JD-required employment 10 months after graduation.

The dean of the Law Center is Leonard M. Baynes.

==History==
The University of Houston Law Center was founded in 1947 as the University of Houston College of Law, with an inaugural class consisting of 28 students and a single professor. The law school was housed in several locations on campus in its first few years—including temporary classrooms and the basement of the M.D. Anderson Library. The College of Law moved to the northeast corner of campus—shortly following its groundbreaking in 1969 and relocated to the newly established five-story, 180,000 square-foot John M. O&#x27;Quinn Law Building in the summer of 2022. 

In 1969, the college was renamed the Bates College of Law for Col. William B. Bates, former member of the University of Houston System Board of Regents and College of Law founding committee. Since 1982, the College of Law has been commonly referred to as the University of Houston Law Center.

In 2005, the University of Houston Law Center opened its facilities to Loyola University New Orleans College of Law after it was severely damaged in Hurricane Katrina, hosting 320 of the Loyola&#x27;s 800 students taught by 31 Loyola law professors, allowing the Loyola students&#x27; education to continue uninterrupted.

==Rankings==
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UHLC tied for the 68th best law school.

In 2024, Law.com named UHLC as No. 23 Go-To Law School in the nation based on graduates gaining employment in the largest 100 law firms in the country.

In 2024, PreLaw magazine recognized UHLC in Trial Advocacy, being one of 20 &quot;A&quot; schools on an &quot;A+&quot; to &quot;A-&quot; scale.

==Facts==
As of fall 2023, the law school reported a total enrollment of 792 students and employed a total of 56 full-time and 178 part-time faculty on staff.

===Admissions===
For the class of 2023, the school received 3,232 applications and accepted 32.27% of applicants, with 24.83% of those accepted enrolling (233 full-time and 29 part-time students). The median undergraduate GPA among all students at the school was 3.72, and the median LSAT score was 161. The class of 2023 is composed of 44.3% minority and 53% female.

===Tuition===
Annual tuition for the 2023–2024 full-time program is $34,942 for Texas residents and $50,132 for non-Texas residents. Annual tuition for the part-time program is $31,079 for Texas residents and $44,309 for non-Texas residents.

==Academics==
The J.D. program is 90 semester hours. Entering classes are generally divided into three full-time day sessions of some 60 students each and one part-time evening section of some 35 students for first-year courses.

The Law Center has special programs and institutes
* Blakely Advocacy Institute
* Center for Children, Law &amp; Policy
* Criminal Justice Institute
* The Environment, Energy, &amp; Natural Resource Center
* Health Law &amp; Policy Institute
* Institute for Intellectual Property &amp; Information Law

The Law Center offers several law clinics for upper-division students: the Appellate Civil Rights Clinic, Civil Justice Clinic, Military Justice Clinic, Entertainment Law Clinic, Entrepreneurship and Community Development Clinic, Immigration Clinic, Mediation Clinic and the Texas Innocence Network.

==University of Houston Law Library==
The director of the law library is Amanda Watson. The library has some 435,000 volumes. The library has three special collections:
* The Frankel Rare Books Collection is a closed-stack collection of rare and out of print books and documents as well as publications of the Law Center faculty.
* The Judge Brown Admiralty Collection is an admiralty and maritime law collection. Established mainly from an endowment by Houston admiralty lawyers, the collection is named in honor of Judge John Robert Brown, a Houston admiralty attorney who served on the Fifth Circuit. The entire collection was lost during Tropical Storm Allison, but was rebuilt through the Albertus book replacement project, completed in 2007.
* The Foreign &amp; International Law Collection, which includes books and other documents on Mexican law.

Tropical Storm Allison flooded the library&#x27;s former location with eight feet of water in June 2001, destroying 174,000 books and the microfiche collection. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) gave $21.4 million to rebuild the library collection, which was 75 percent of the replacement cost. The collection has since been rebuilt.

==Journals and publications==
The Law Center publishes five law journals. The &quot;Houston Law Review&quot;, established in 1963, is the school&#x27;s main law journal.

The four specialty journals are the &quot;Houston Business and Tax Law Journal&quot; (business law, tax law; founded in 2001), the &quot;Houston Journal of Health Law and Policy&quot; (health care law), the &quot;Houston Journal of International Law&quot; (international law), and the &quot;Journal of Consumer &amp; Commercial Law&quot; (commercial law).

== Employment ==
According to UHLC&#x27;s official 2023 ABA-required disclosures, 92.2% of the Class of 2023 was employed in some capacity, 85% obtained full-time, long-term, bar admission required employment (as attorneys), and 6.25% obtained JD-required employment 10 months after graduation.

==Costs==
The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at UHLC for the 2022–2023 academic year is $54,633.86 for a resident living on campus and $69,451.86 for a nonresident.[38] The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $197,267 for residents and $239,808 for nonresidents.

<text>David J. Sirota (born November 2, 1975) is the founder and editor-in-chief of &quot;The Lever&quot;, a reader-supported investigative news outlet focused on exposing the negative influence of corporate corruption on American society. Sirota was a speechwriter and senior adviser for the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign. In 2022, he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for conceiving the story for Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; alongside co-writer and director Adam McKay.

Sirota&#x27;s professional career has spanned politics, media, and journalism. In politics, he has held roles such as campaign manager, fundraiser, spokesperson, strategist, and consultant for a variety of left-leaning Democratic candidates and office holders. He twice worked for Bernie Sanders, both when Sanders was a member of the U. S. House of Representatives and as part of Sanders 2020 presidential campaign. He was also a staff member of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and advocacy group.

Sirota has also been a columnist for &quot;Guardian US&quot;, editor-at-large for American left publication &quot;Jacobin&quot; and senior investigations editor for &quot;The International Business Times&quot;. He has also worked as television writer and radio host. He has written three books: &quot;Hostile Takeover&quot; (2006), an exploration of corruption in the U.S. political system, &quot;The Uprising&quot; (2008), about ordinary citizens frustrations with the U.S. government, and &quot;Back to Our Future&quot; (2011), which explores how the politics and culture of the 1980s influenced the thinking of later generations.

In his political career, Sirota has been described by his critics as &quot;an attack dog&quot;, and by his allies as &quot;intense, driven, even obsessive&quot;, and someone with an &quot;eye for critique and the instinct for the jugular [of his political opponents].&quot; In 2003, journalist Richard Wolffe described Sirota as &quot;a man on a mission.&quot; In 2023, reflecting on Sirota&#x27;s varied career, former CNN host Brian Stelter wrote, &quot;Sirota&#x27;s life has been one long campaign against plutocrats and the corrupt politicians who enable them.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Sirota is a native of Abington Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. He is the eldest son of Rob Sirota, a retired physician, and Karen Sirota, the former president of a local synagogue. He has two younger brothers. He has described himself as &quot;growing up as a relatively observant Reformed Jew in a Jewish community.&quot;

Sirota has also described himself as an &quot;intense&quot; fan of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team while growing up, particularly of the players Charles Barkley and Rick Mahorn. Sirota was able to meet Barkley in 1986 and have his picture taken with him.

Sirota was also a fan of the local Philadelphia news station WPVI-TV (a.k.a 6abc). When Sirota was in the 8th grade, he shadowed local sportscaster Gary Papa for a day. He described his love of the local news station &quot;as part of my journey into journalism.&quot;

Sirota met the future actor Bradley Cooper, who lived in the neighboring town of Jenkintown, when they both played on the 1985 East Abington Little League Baseball team.

Sirota attended the William Penn Charter School in Philadelphia, where he was close friends with Adam F. Goldberg, who went on to create the TV series &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;. Goldberg&#x27;s series, about his life growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, featured a recurring character based on Sirota in multiple episodes of the series. The character was also named David Sirota.

Sirota attended the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University from 1994 to 1998, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism and political science. While there, he worked as a reporter for the &quot;Daily Northwestern&quot;. He also worked on his first political race during his senior year.

==Career==
===Political career, 1998–2008===
Sirota&#x27;s career in political campaigns began when he was a research director for Illinois State Senator Howard W. Carroll&#x27;s unsuccessful run for U.S. representative in Illinois&#x27;s 9th congressional district in the 1998 election; Carroll lost in the Democratic primary to Illinois State Representative Jan Schakowsky. In 1999, Sirota served as Dwight Evans&#x27;s deputy mayoral campaign manager in Philadelphia. He was let go for &quot;overzealous behavior&quot; related to the creation of a fake website containing damaging racial comments attributed to Evans&#x27; opponent John White Jr. Evans said he believed that Sirota had not created the bogus page, but had discussed it with the person who created it, who was his friend and former college classmate at Northwestern. Sirota then became a fundraiser for Joe Hoeffel in his first successful campaign for the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania&#x27;s 13th congressional district.

From 1999 to 2001, Sirota worked as press aide and spokesperson for Bernie Sanders, who was then serving as the U.S. representative from Vermont. Sirota has stated that working for Sanders was &quot;completely transformative for me as a person&quot;. Sirota also said: &quot;When I first worked for him, I was right out of college. It helped me find who I was and what my values are.&quot; According to journalist Brian Stelter, &quot;[Sirota] experienced Congress in all its possibility and all its vulgarity through the eyes of the only registered independent in the institution.&quot;

From 2001 to 2003, Sirota worked as the communications director for the Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee. He managed press and message development on health care, education, defense, the environment and post-9/11 national security issues.

From 2003 to 2005, Sirota worked at the Center for American Progress (CAP), a liberal research and advocacy group, where he was responsible for rapid response and media outreach. Sirota was hired for the job by former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta. According to journalist Richard Wolffe, Podesta said of Sirota: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know him. I just saw he had an eye for critique and the instinct for the jugular.&quot; Wolffe wrote a profile of Sirota in &quot;Newsweek&quot; in Oct 2003, in which he described Sirota as &quot;the Internet child of the Clinton &quot;war room&quot; generation.&quot; Wolffe also described Sirota as a &quot;political operative&quot; skilled at &quot;hacking out a daily barrage of anti-Bush media clips, commentary, and snappy quotes&quot; who made &quot;guerrilla attacks on the Bush administration&quot;, and who was &quot;well schooled in the art of Washington warfare.&quot; According to the article, Sirota&#x27;s main weapons were computer emails. For example, Sirota unearthed a two-year-old comment that Colin Powell had made to the effect that &quot;Iraq posed no threat to its neighbors, and possessed no &#x27;significant capability&#x27; in weapons of mass destruction.&quot; Sirota made Powell&#x27;s statements more widely known. Reporters pounced, and it became a public relations blow to the Bush administration. Sirota was credited with having revealed that $87 billion for Iraq could have been used to erase huge state deficits at home, a fact that was repeated by Democrats nationwide. Sirota also created the CAP publication &quot;Progress Report&quot;.

Sirota served as a senior strategist for Brian Schweitzer&#x27;s unsuccessful 2000 Senate campaign and successful 2004 gubernatorial campaign. In September 2006, Sirota worked as a political consultant for Ned Lamont&#x27;s U.S. Senate campaign. Lamont defeated Joe Lieberman in the primary, but Lieberman ran as an independent and defeated Lamont in the November election. In 2008, Sirota was co-chair of the Progressive Legislative Action Network (now renamed the Progressive States Network). He was a senior fellow at the Campaign for America&#x27;s Future.

===Journalism and media career, 2005–2019===
In May 2005, Sirota became a contributor to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; while writing his own blog. He was a regular guest on &quot;The Al Franken Show&quot; and makes guest appearances on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, &quot;NOW&quot;, &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;, CNBC, and NPR. He is a senior editor at &quot;In These Times&quot;, a regular columnist for &quot;The Nation&quot; and the &quot;Intermountain Jewish News&quot;, and a past contributor to &quot;The American Prospect&quot;. He has been published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;.

Sirota was a contributor to OpenLeft, a now-defunct progressive political blog. In June 2007, he replaced the late progressive columnist Molly Ivins with a column to be syndicated nationally by Creators Syndicate. Sirota became a contributing writer for Salon in May 2011.

From 2009 to 2012, Sirota was the morning host at the Denver progressive talk station KKZN. Sirota was initially filling in for Jay Marvin on his eponymous program; but Marvin was ultimately unable to return, and Sirota became the permanent host in 2010. Sirota also guest hosted for Thom Hartmann and Norman Goldman. On July 16, 2012, Sirota moved to sister station KHOW to co-host an afternoon drive program with former George W. Bush administration FEMA director Michael D. Brown, &quot;The Rundown with Sirota and Brown&quot;. In January 2013, after nearly four years in radio, Sirota parted ways with KHOW/Clear Channel. Insiders speculate the reason for the abrupt departure was friction between the two co-hosts; it left Brown with his own show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Westword Jan 2013 Sirota out at KHOW/Clear Channel&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Sirota joined &quot;The Young Turks&quot; online broadcast network as a contributor, providing periodic investigative reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adweek TYT/Young Turks March 2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2018, after four years of reporting for the &quot;International Business Times&quot; as senior editor of investigations, Sirota left that publication.

=== Sanders campaign 2019–2020 ===
On March 19, 2019, the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign announced it had hired Sirota to work as a senior advisor and speechwriter. Sirota joined the Sanders campaign after fourteen years working as a journalist. He stated that he was &quot;happy&quot; working as a journalist, and that journalism is &quot;extremely important.&quot; But he accepted the job on the campaign because &quot;I think the crises we&#x27;re facing now are so enormously existential that when I was asked to serve in this role, I felt I had an obligation and a responsibility to serve. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m doing it.&quot;

In describing his role as a speechwriter for Sanders, Sirota stated, &quot;But even though the position is called &#x27;speechwriter,&#x27; nobody puts words in Bernie Sanders&#x27;s mouth. He knows exactly what he wants to say and exactly how he wants to say it. So I&#x27;ll be supporting him in doing these speeches in the sense of everything from research to data to incorporating examples and stories about what he&#x27;s saying.&quot;

In addition to speech writing, Sirota also helped to &quot;plan campaign strategy&quot; and functioned &quot;as a rapid-response war room.&quot; Sirota also published an email newsletter, called &quot;Bern Notice,&quot; and a podcast called &quot;Hear the Bern.&quot; The newsletter and podcast were ways &quot;through which the campaign has tried to bypass traditional news outlets and reach voters directly.&quot;

The Sander&#x27;s campaign was notable for its criticism of the mainstream media outlets and their coverage of the issues surrounding the campaign. Writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, journalist Marc Tracy stated:
:Mr. Sirota ... has amplified the campaign&#x27;s consistent focus on criticizing news outlets that most regard as mainstream, targeting stories that he considers unfair.

As an example of the campaign&#x27;s media criticism, Tracy cited an instance of the campaign&#x27;s newsletter (&quot;Bern Notice&quot;):
:When the first in-house newsletter of Bernie Sanders&#x27;s campaign landed in inboxes last August, its chief antagonist was neither President Trump nor a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, but rather &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and, as the email said, &quot;the Washington pundits who are paid by the corporations and billionaires who own the media.&quot;

:Campaigning in Iowa a few days earlier, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, had accused &quot;The Post&quot; of withholding positive coverage because of his efforts to raise the minimum wage at Amazon, the internet retail giant founded by the newspaper&#x27;s owner, Jeff Bezos. Several prominent journalists objected to the comment—a &quot;full freak out,&quot; as the newsletter, which is called Bern Notice, put it.

:&quot;Reporters don&#x27;t have to receive a call from Jeff Bezos,&quot; [the newsletter] said, “to know that their paychecks are signed by a billionaire with a well-known personal and corporate agenda—and knowing that agenda exists can shape overall frameworks and angles of coverage.”

Soon after Sirota joined the Sanders campaign, the journalist Edward-Isaac Dovere published an article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; accusing Sirota of secretly working on behalf of the Sanders campaign while he was still working as a journalist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Capital &amp; Main&quot;. Sirota, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and the Sanders campaign refuted these accusations; the editors of &quot;Capital &amp; Main&quot; declined to comment on the accuracy of the story. Dovere&#x27;s accusations were also refuted by other investigative journalists. According to journalist Walker Bragman, &quot;[Dovere&#x27;s] story hinged on an unverifiable quote which the speaker claims was misrepresented, along with innuendo stemming from the fact that Sirota deleted thousands of tweets following his employment. &quot;Paste&quot; spoke to multiple campaign insiders familiar with the matter, all of whom disputed Dovere&#x27;s timeline and narrative. Their accounts lined up with what we found through our own reporting on unrelated matters over the last few months. Other individuals have also come forward to publicly refute the article’s claims.&quot; Journalist Glenn Greenwald wrote, &quot;Most critically, the key claim that made the article such a sensation – that Sirota&#x27;s &quot;informal work for Sanders goes back months&quot; and included “quietly writing speeches” for the Senator – is entirely and demonstrably false.&quot;

Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign on April 8, 2020. He endorsed Joe Biden on April 13.

===&quot;Jacobin&quot;===

In May 2020, Sirota joined &quot;Jacobin&quot; as editor-at-large.

=== &quot;The Lever&quot; (news outlet) ===


In April 2020, Sirota launched an independent news outlet, &quot;The Daily Poster&quot;. In May 2021, &quot;The Daily Poster&quot; moved from Substack to an independent website. In March, 2022, the site was expanded and renamed as &quot;The Lever&quot;, running on Ghost.

The name &quot;The Lever&quot; is inspired by a quote from the Greek mathematician Archimedes, who said, &quot;Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world.&quot; Former CNN host Brian Stelter described &quot;The Lever&quot; as a &quot;small but mighty news start-up.&quot;

As of April 2024, &quot;The Lever&quot; has more than 112,000 active free and paying subscribers, and a staff of nineteen. &quot;The Lever&#x27;s&quot; mission, according to Sirota, is to &quot;hold power accountable.&quot; According to Managing Editor Joel Warner, &quot;The Lever&#x27;s&quot; &quot;bread and butter&quot; reporting and &quot;core area of success&quot; is reporting on &quot;how corporate power is making everything worse for the rest of us&quot;.

The investigative reporting from &quot;The Lever&quot; is frequently cited by other news outlets, including citations in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, NPR, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Politico&quot;, Al Jazeera, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. &quot;The Lever&#x27;s&quot; reporting has also been cited in tweets and press releases by politicians such as Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Congressman Ro Khanna, and Congressman Chris Deluzio.

===&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; (film)===
In 2022, Sirota received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for conceiving the story for Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; alongside co-writer and director Adam McKay. The film &quot;tells the story of how an asteroid hurtling toward Earth is ignored by politicians and society in favor of profit and campaigning.&quot; According to McKay, his friend Sirota gave him the idea for the film: &quot;&#x27;David made a comment about how [the climate crisis was like] an asteroid [about] to hit the planet and no one cares—and it was perfect,&#x27; McKay explained. &#x27;I liked it because it could be funny too, and it’s a big, clear idea that a lot of people can enter. That was it.&#x27;&quot;

In describing the message of the film, Sirota stated: &quot;Every politician is asked questions about the economy. What we have to do is bake that same attitude about climate into the coverage. The economy is the way we talk about politics. The livable atmosphere needs to be at the same level.&quot;

In Jan 2022, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Up&quot; became Netflix&#x27;s second biggest film of all time. Regarding the success of film, Sirota stated: &quot;I never expected the movie to become a cultural phenomenon. [...] I think the reason that happened is because it’s a movie about the here and now. This movie feels a lot like reality. Everybody has strong opinions on the here and now.&quot;

Sirota also stated: 
:I&#x27;m most gratified to hear from climate scientists and people fighting corruption, and others who may feel that they&#x27;ve been marginalized. I know how they feel. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of my life working for causes that have been marginalized, and I&#x27;ve sometimes felt marginalized and berated and vilified. My hope is that in making those folks feel seen and recognized, and by giving them a voice, it further emboldens them and the movements that are trying to save our world.

== Books ==

=== &quot;Hostile Takeover&quot; ===
In May 2006, Random House&#x27;s Crown Publishers released Sirota&#x27;s book &quot;Hostile Takeover&quot;. The first chapter of the book was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in July 2006. Sirota read sections of his book in public. In the book, Sirota argued that corporate interests are driving U.S. economic policy. The book became a &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller on July 9, 2006, entering at #23 on the nonfiction list. The paperback edition came out a year later.

Sirota&#x27;s &quot;Hostile Takeover&quot; (2006) was reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Tobin Harshaw who described Sirota as a &quot;Montana-based blogger with a take-no-prisoners mind-set&quot; with &quot;an admirably organized mind&quot;. Harshaw applauded some Sirota suggestions as &quot;admirably specific, occasionally realistic and arguably on the side of the angels&quot; and capable of bipartisan support, such as his recommendations for &quot;regulating malpractice insurance for doctors... restoring state control over class-action laws... (and) forcing chief executives to certify corporate tax returns so they face liability for fraud.&quot; He felt Sirota was critical of &quot;mainstream Democratic centrists&quot;. Harshaw criticized the writing style as &quot;cliched&quot; and &quot;oppressive&quot; and too lengthy and needing an editor, but admitted Sirota presented a &quot;creditable analysis.&quot;

Sirota responded to Harshaw&#x27;s review in a letter to the editor. Sirota denied his book was critical of mainstream Democrats but aimed squarely at &quot;exposing Republican hypocrisy.&quot; He described his position as a &quot;centrist exploration of the corruption of the entire system&quot; that &quot;isn&#x27;t the fault of just one party or another.&quot;

There was controversy in Washington, D.C., in 2007 about whether Sirota was a &quot;journalist&quot; or an &quot;activist&quot;. While the Washington press corps tends to see him as an &quot;activist&quot;, at one point he was criticized for skirting the rules about access to Congress, which would on some occasions deny activists access, by getting a &quot;temporary intern&#x27;s ID&quot;; this gave him access to the Senate chamber, but he was criticized in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; afterward. He was described as having &quot;pulled an end-run around the press galleries.&quot; Sirota denied he got &quot;special access&quot; and that such a claim was &quot;just bizarre&quot;. He added: &quot;I think a lot of reporters on the Hill want to monopolize access to our government as a way to preserve their monopoly on news I guess.&quot; Some analysts observed that conservative journalists were activists as well; one noted &quot;(&quot;Weekly Standard&quot; columnist) Fred Barnes has credentials, he espouses political views.&quot;

=== &quot;The Uprising&quot; ===
Sirota&#x27;s book &quot;The Uprising&quot; was released in June 2008. It was ranked 20th on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list on June 15, 2008. The book was also listed on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Political Bestseller list for the month of July 2008. Sirota made speeches about his book at prestigious venues such as Hofstra University.

A mostly positive review of &quot;The Uprising&quot; from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book as chronicling &quot;how ordinary citizens on the right and the left are marshaling their frustrations with the government into uprisings across the country.&quot; The reviewer cited &quot;entertaining case studies&quot; with a &quot;conversational&quot; tone and a fast-paced narrative with &quot;numerous high notes.&quot; Sirota gave a &quot;fine elucidation of continuing Democratic support for the Iraq War&quot; and examined the &quot;&quot;echo chamber&quot; qualities of beltway television shows like Hardball.&quot; The book presents &quot;a rousing account of the local uprisings already in effect.&quot;

A &quot;Newark Star-Ledger&quot; political critic reviewing the book described Sirota as an &quot;enterprising&quot; reporter who used &quot;resourceful&quot; tactics to get entry into such venues as Capitol Hill, the Microsoft campus, an ExxonMobil stockholders meeting, and the Mexican border. In the book, Sirota attacks CNN star Lou Dobbs less for his &quot;endless broadcasts on illegal immigration&quot; but more for the way he &quot;browbeats his staff and runs roughshod over the CNN management.&quot; The critic felt the book&#x27;s &quot;search for a national uprising is somewhat out of focus&quot; but was a &quot;lively read.&quot;

=== &quot;Back to Our Future&quot; ===
Sirota&#x27;s book &quot;Back to Our Future&quot; was released in March 2011. This book explores &quot;how the &#x27;80s have informed policies, politics, new pop culture, and society today, and how history and pop culture of times long past affected the &#x27;80s as well.&quot;

Publishers Weekly states:
:Sirota argues that the combination of Reagan, the &quot;candidate of nostalgia&quot;; hypermilitarist movies that re-demonized communism; and sophisticated marketing campaigns glorifying the cult of the individual led to our current culture&#x27;s narcissism and obsessive pursuit of wealth and celebrity. In his effort to fit current trends to his overriding thesis, Sirota occasionally makes some sweeping statements, such as claiming the military&#x27;s public relations campaign was so successful that Americans &quot;never dare question&quot; the military, ignoring the numerous anti–Iraq War protests and the outrage over the Abu Ghraib photographs. But the many of his arguments are well informed and sparkle with wit and irreverence.

Jenny Williams states:
:&quot;Back to Our Future&quot; is about much more than just the decade of the &#x27;80s. The author also dives into how society brought back the culture of the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s in different ways, for different purposes. He talks about how society is manipulating our memories and using the rhetoric to guide people&#x27;s thinking and voting habits.

==Political views==
Sirota is a critic of neoliberal economic policies and has leveled criticism at the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. Sirota supported John Edwards in the 2008 Democratic party primaries. He has criticized the Democratic Leadership Council and other Democrats, who he claims have &quot;sold out&quot; to corporate interests and has argued that the term &quot;centrist&quot; is a misnomer in that these politicians are out of touch with public opinion. Sirota&#x27;s article &quot;The Democrats&#x27; Da Vinci Code&quot; argues that leftist politicians are more successful in so-called &quot;red states&quot; than the mainstream media have previously reported. He is an opponent of free trade policies, a supporter of fair trade, and an advocate of workers&#x27; rights and organized labor. His May 2007 speech at the Montana AFL–CIO Convention in Butte articulated many of his views. Sirota supported Sherrod Brown over Paul Hackett for the 2006 Senate election in Ohio and criticized Hackett&#x27;s claims that he was &quot;forced out&quot; of the race by party elders as disingenuous. In 2008, Sirota stated on radio program &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; that he had cast an early vote for Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama.

Sirota has been a strong supporter of the economic stimulus efforts of the Obama administration. However, he has criticized such efforts as insufficient and has strongly supported further stimulus efforts.

Sirota was criticized by Fox News hosts and commentators Mark Steyn, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Greg Gutfeld, and Robert Spencer in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing for an article he wrote for &quot;Salon&quot; entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Hope the Boston Marathon Bomber Is a White American.&quot; These critics asserted that Sirota downplayed the Islamic nature of the attack.

Some other journalists and political analysts have criticized Sirota. In his article comparing two approaches to progressive politics, statistician Nate Silver disparaged Sirota&#x27;s approach as &quot;playing fast and loose with the truth and using some of the same demagogic precepts that the right wing does.&quot; Regarding Sirota&#x27;s political analysis and projections, including his predictions during the 2008 presidential election, Al Giordano derided him as &quot;an inverted compass: when Sirota says &#x27;heads,&#x27; you can make a lot of money betting on &#x27;tails.&#x27;&quot;

In 2016, right-wing commentators at the conservative &quot;National Review&quot; and libertarian &quot;Reason&quot; upbraided Sirota for his 2013 &quot;Salon&quot; article entitled &quot;Hugo Chavez&#x27;s economic miracle&quot;. Sirota wrote in 2013 that Chavez was &quot;no saint&quot;, but also that his socialist and redistributionist policies had led to Venezuela&#x27;s GDP more than doubling and reduced poverty to the third-lowest level in South America. According to critics, Sirota overlooked that Venezuela&#x27;s economic gains were based almost entirely on petroleum exports.

In 2018, Sirota argued immediate action must be taken against the influence and power of oil and gas corporations to fight climate change, and Democrats must choose a side. &quot;Will our political class behold the fossil fuel industry&#x27;s sociopathy and realize that we face an existential choice between profits and ecological survival?&quot; asked Sirota.

==Personal life==
Sirota lives in Denver with his wife Emily, and their two children.

In January 2018, Emily Sirota announced her candidacy for a seat in the Colorado House of Representatives, promising a &quot;bold, progressive agenda.&quot; In June, she won the Democratic primary in District 9, based in southeastern Denver. In November, she won the general election, with 72 percent of the vote to Republican Bob Lane&#x27;s 28.

He has lived in various cities around the country including Philadelphia, Chicago, San Diego, Washington, D.C., Helena, and Denver.

==Depiction in fiction==
A character based on Sirota was featured in multiple episodes of the ABC TV series &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;. Sirota is close friends with the series creator Adam F. Goldberg. They have been friends since they attended the William Penn Charter School together.

Goldberg&#x27;s series is about his life growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Sirota&#x27;s character in the series is also named &quot;David Sirota,&quot; and is portrayed by the actor Sam Kindseth. The character first appeared in the season 2 episode &quot;Van People.&quot; This episode was dedicated to Sirota; the dedication shows archive footage of Sirota during his time at William Penn Charter School, as well as a brief clip of Sirota appearing on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

<doc id="567069" wikidata="Q7007452" url="?curid=567069" title="New English Bible">
<text>The New English Bible (NEB) is an English translation of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1961 and the Old Testament (with the Apocrypha) was published on 16 March 1970. In 1989, it was significantly revised and republished as the Revised English Bible.

==Background==
Near the time when the copyright to the English Revised Version was due to expire (1935), the Oxford University Press (OUP), and the Cambridge University Press (CUP), who were the current English Revised Version copyright holders, began investigations to determine whether a modern revision of the English Revised Version text was necessary. In May 1946 G. S. Hendry, along with the Presbytery of Stirling and Dunblane produced a notice, which was presented to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, indicating that the work of translating should be undertaken in order to produce a Bible with thoroughly &quot;modern English.&quot; After the work of delegation was finished, a general conference was held in October 1946 where it was determined that a completely fresh translation should be undertaken rather than a revision as originally suggested by the University Presses of Oxford and Cambridge.

==Translation==
In due time, three committees of translators and one committee of literary advisers were enlisted to produce the New English Bible. Each of the translation committees was responsible for a different section of the Bible: the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, and the New Testament.

The work of translating was typically undertaken in this fashion: A member, or members, of one of the committees would produce a draft of a book, or books, of the Bible (typically from the section in which they were assigned) and submit the draft to the section committee. Occasionally a scholar outside the committee would be invited to participate in this phase of the translation process and was asked to submit a draft of the book or books with which he or she had renowned experience. This draft was then distributed among the members of the appropriate committee. Members of the committee would then meet and discuss the translation choices made in the draft. The draft that resulted from this meeting of the concerned committee was then sent to the committee of literary advisers, who would revise the draft in co-operation with the translators. When a consensus on the draft was reached, the final draft would be sent on to the Joint Committee, which was head over the four sub-committees.

For the Old Testament the translators primarily made use of the Masoretic Text as presented by Rudolf Kittel in his 3rd Edition of the &quot;Biblia Hebraica&quot; (1937). In addition to the Masoretic Text, the translators also made use of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Greek Septuagint, the Aramaic Targums, and the Syriac &quot;Peshitta&quot;.

For the Apocrypha the translators made the decision to follow &quot;The Old Testament in Greek according to the Septuagint&quot;, edited by Henry Barclay Swete. Also, the translators made use of the &quot;Codex Sinaiticus&quot; (for the Book of Tobit), Theodotion&#x27;s translation of the Apocrypha (for The Song of the Three, Daniel and Susanna, and Daniel, Bel and the Snake (sometimes referred to as the Dragon)), &quot;Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209&quot; (for Sirach), &quot;Codex 248&quot; (also for Sirach), and Robert Lubbock Bensly&#x27;s Latin text &quot;The Fourth Book of Ezra&quot; for 2 Esdras.

For the New Testament the New English Bible translators relied on a large body of texts including early Greek New Testament manuscripts, early translations rendered in other languages (those aside from Greek), and the quotations of early Christian writers and speakers. The main source text of the New English Bible&#x27;s New Testament can be found in &quot;The Greek New Testament&quot;, edited by R.V.G. Tasker and published by the University Presses of Oxford and Cambridge (1964).

==Form==
The translators of the New English Bible chose to render their translation using a principle of translation called dynamic equivalence (also referred to as functional equivalence or thought-for-thought translation). C. H. Dodd, Vice-chairman and Director of the Joint Committee, commented that the translators &quot;...conceived our task to be that of understanding the original as precisely as we could... and then saying again in our own native idiom what we believed the author to be saying in his.&quot;

This method of translation is in contrast to the traditional translations of the Authorized Version (King James Version), English Revised Version, American Standard Version, Revised Standard Version, and others, which place an emphasis on word-for-word correspondence between the source and target language. Dodd goes on to summarize the translation of the New English Bible as &quot;...free, it may be, rather than literal, but a faithful translation nevertheless, so far as we could compass it.&quot;

As a result, the New English Bible is necessarily more paraphrastic at times in order to render the thoughts of the original author into modern English.

==Reception==
Biblical scholar F. F. Bruce declared that &quot;To the sponsors and translators of the New English Bible the English speaking world owes an immense debt. They have given us a version which is contemporary in idiom, up-to-date in scholarship, attractive, and at times exciting in content&quot;. T. S. Eliot, however, commented that the New English Bible &quot;astonishes in its combination of the vulgar, the trivial and the pedantic&quot;. Henry Gifford argued that &quot;the new translators … kill the wonder&quot;. The British publisher and author Adam Nicolson, in his 2003 book on the King James Bible, criticized the newer translation for its &#x27;anxiety not to bore or intimidate&#x27;.

The New English Bible was produced before gender-neutral language was used in translations of the Bible. Thus, the NEB rendered pronouns (and other parts of speech) using traditional English grammatical construction, translating &quot;he&quot; from the original manuscripts to refer either to a male human being or to a sexually undistinguished human being. This traditional construction has now become controversial in some Christian circles (as in other parts of English-speaking societies), and a recent revision of the New English Bible entitled &quot;The Revised English Bible&quot; incorporates gender-inclusive language.

The NEB with the Apocrypha is one of the versions authorized to be used in services of the Episcopal Church.

<text>Jar of Flies is the third studio EP by American rock band Alice in Chains. It was released on January 25, 1994, by Columbia Records. The band&#x27;s second acoustic EP, after 1992&#x27;s &quot;Sap&quot;, it was the first acoustic EP in music history to debut at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with the first week sales exceeding 141,000 copies in the United States. The self-produced record was written and recorded over the course of just one week at the London Bridge Studio in Seattle. The tracks &quot;No Excuses&quot;, &quot;I Stay Away&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Follow&quot; were released as singles to promote the EP. &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 1995: Best Recording Package and Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;I Stay Away&quot;.

The EP was well received by critics and has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; one of the band&#x27;s most successful releases. In Canada, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was certified double platinum for sales of 200,000 copies. In the United Kingdom, the album was certified silver after selling 60,000 copies there.

==Background and recording==
Following Alice in Chains&#x27; extensive 1993 world tour for &quot;Dirt&quot;, bassist Mike Starr getting fired during the tour for his drug use, and Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez joining the band, the members returned home to Seattle after the end of their Lollapalooza tour and found themselves evicted from their residence after failing to pay the rent. Homeless, the band then moved into the London Bridge Studio in Seattle.

During Alice in Chains&#x27; June–August 1993 appearance at Lollapalooza, guitarist Jerry Cantrell called producer Toby Wright with a proposal to collaborate on new material. Wright reacted positively and booked ten days at the London Bridge Studio. Despite Cantrell&#x27;s assurances, the band did not have any planned tracks before the session began. Drummer Sean Kinney had said, &quot;After playing loud music for a year, we&#x27;d come home and the last thing we wanted to do was crank up the amps right away. That stuff was written on buses and whenever we had downtime. We did &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; to see how it was to record with [bassist] Mike Inez. We just went into the studio with no songs written, to check out the chemistry. It all fell into place. The sounds and the tones were really good. We thought it would be a waste not to put that material out.&quot;

The first session took place on September 7, 1993. Vocalist Layne Staley said the band &quot;just wanted to go into the studio for a few days with our acoustic guitars and see what happened. We never really planned on the music we made at that time to be released. But the record label heard it and they really liked it. For us, it was just the experience of four guys getting together in the studio and making some music.&quot; The album&#x27;s sessions lasted 14–18 hours a day, and recording was complete within seven days. Assistant engineer Jonathan Plum described the sessions as &quot;exhaustive&quot;. The album was recorded on tape on a Neve 80-68 mixing console because Wright wanted the album&#x27;s acoustic sound to be as natural as possible. Staley instructed that Pro Tools not be used within the studio; as Wright explained, &quot;Layne absolutely had a working knowledge of his sonic preferences in the studio - and felt analog sounded better for the band&#x27;s sound.&quot; The album&#x27;s tracks were mostly recorded within one or two takes.

The album&#x27;s acoustic guitar sound was particularly focused on. Wright recalled that &quot;at some points we overdubbed some acoustics with micing those acoustics, but when they were recording live off the floor, I&#x27;d use whatever pick-ups [Cantrell] had in his guitars at the time, trying to keep that sound as close to acoustic-sounding as possible. So that it sounded like it was an acoustic guitar instead of an electrified acoustic guitar.&quot; Cantrell played using Ovation guitars during the album&#x27;s sessions. To reflect the recording&#x27;s acoustic climate, Kinney sometimes used brushes to obtain a softer feel. AKG 414 microphones were used for overhead registration, while D-12s were used for the floor and rack toms, and Sennheiser MD 421s were placed on the kick drum. 451s and 57s were mounted on the top side of the snare drum, while a 441 was fitted on the bottom side.

The characteristic syncopated drum opening in &quot;No Excuses&quot; was a result of Kinney&#x27;s improvised experimentation with side-stick drumming. Wright was not an advocate of the technique and said that they &quot;eventually wound up with some bongos and some smaller drums set up over the hi-hat that we incorporated into that groove.&quot; Staley wrote much of the album&#x27;s lyrics within the studio and arranged the album&#x27;s vocal harmonies. Wright recalled the pace of Staley&#x27;s work as quick, and that the vocal tracks were recorded within one or two takes via a Neumann M-49 microphone. Cantrell performed the lead vocals in the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Follow&quot;. Wright described Cantrell as an &quot;awesome&quot; singer, and stressed that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t have done all those harmonies without him.&quot; The album&#x27;s sessions concluded on September 14. Wright mixed the album at Scream Studios in Los Angeles, California from September 17–22.

==Music and lyrics==
Due to the dominance of acoustic instruments in &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, the album is often considered a continuation of the sound adopted by the band on the 1992 EP &quot;Sap&quot;. The album demonstrates the band&#x27;s wide range by offering a variety of tracks with an acoustic texture, featuring elements of blues rock and jangle pop. Steve Huey of AllMusic stressed that &quot;the mood is still hopelessly bleak, but the poignant, introspective tone produces a sense of acceptance that&#x27;s actually soothing, in a funereal sort of way. Jerry Cantrell&#x27;s arrangements keep growing more detailed and layered; while there are a few noisy moments, most of &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; is bathed in a clean, shimmering ambience whose source is difficult to pin down&quot;. Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that Staley&#x27;s vocals on the tracks &quot;Swing on This&quot; and &quot;Rotten Apple&quot; &quot;ow[e] as much to Styx and Kansas as Jerry Cantrell’s guitars do to Black Sabbath&quot;, and that the vocals &quot;evoke pathos as well as anger.&quot; Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that &quot;No Excuses&quot; has a &#x27;70s-influenced style and described &quot;Swing on This&quot; as &quot;postmodern boogie-woogie&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrics are dark and gloomy, with Huey writing that &quot;&quot;Jar of Flies&quot; is about living with the consequences, full of deeply felt reflections on loneliness, self-imposed isolation, and lost human connections.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that &quot;Alice in Chains prizes solitude on &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;, a set of songs about rugged individualism turned into exile.&quot;

==Title and packaging==
The album&#x27;s title originates from a science experiment that Cantrell conducted in third grade. The experiment consisted of maintaining two jars full of flies. The flies in one jar would be overfed, while the flies in the other jar would be underfed. The flies that were overfed reproduced rapidly, but then died from overcrowding. The flies that were underfed managed to survive throughout the year. Concerning the anecdote, Staley said &quot;I guess there&#x27;s a message in there somewhere. Evidently that experiment had a big impact on Jerry.&quot;

Rocky Schenck photographed the album cover in his dining room on September 8, 1993. As he recalled, &quot;The band had come up with the idea for the title and wanted the cover to be a young boy looking into a jar filled with flies. I remember they asked me to use &#x27;crazy colors&#x27; in the shot, so I utilized lots of different gels over the lights to achieve the final look.&quot; Schenck&#x27;s assistant took several trips to a nearby horse stable where he caught hundreds of flies using a butterfly net. On January 27, 2019, two days following the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Schenck published rare outtakes from the album cover shoot on his Instagram account and said that he has forgotten the name of the kid on the cover.

The first pressing of the compact disc for &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; included plastic flies visible on the front view of the clear spine. It earned a Grammy nomination for Best Recording Package. The record received a multi-format reissue for its 30th anniversary in 2024. One of them was a vinyl record with the carcasses of real flies pressed into it and limited to 100 copies.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was released on January 25, 1994, by Columbia Records. The album was promoted by two singles, &quot;No Excuses&quot; and &quot;I Stay Away&quot;, both of which received music videos. &quot;No Excuses&quot; reached #1 on the Album Rock Tracks chart, becoming the first single by the band to do so. Cantrell admitted that &quot;we couldn&#x27;t believe that it did so well,&quot; and that &quot;the success of &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; showed us that we could do what we liked and that other people would like it too.&quot; A limited edition Enhanced CD was produced. This version of the album includes a lyric sheet, a biography and discography of the band, the music videos for &quot;No Excuses&quot; and &quot;I Stay Away&quot; and fragments of interviews with the musicians. In addition, 2,500 copies were made of a double EP including &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; and &quot;Sap&quot;.

The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number one; with first week sales of over 141,000 copies, becoming the first ever EP and first Alice in Chains release to top the charts. It was the only EP ever to gain this distinction until 2004, when the &quot;Collision Course&quot; mashup EP by Jay-Z and Linkin Park also achieved the number one spot ten years later, and Bad Meets Evil&#x27;s EP &quot;&quot; in 2011. &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; sold 2,037,853 copies during its first year and was later certified triple platinum in 1995 and quadruple platinum in 2022.

Paul Evans of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the EP &quot;darkly gorgeous&quot;, and Steve Huey stated &quot;&quot;Jar of Flies&quot; is a low-key stunner, achingly gorgeous and harrowingly sorrowful all at once.&quot;

===Awards and accolades===
The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package in 1995, but lost to Buddy Jackson for &quot;Tribute to the Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys&quot; performed by Asleep at the Wheel. The single &quot;I Stay Away&quot; was nominated for the Best Hard Rock Performance.

In November 2011, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was ranked No. 4 on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1994.

It was featured on &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list in 2014.

In April 2014, &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was ranked No. 12 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;40 Best Records From Mainstream Alternative&#x27;s Greatest Year&quot; list. In May 2014, the EP was placed at No. 5 on &quot;Loudwire&quot;″s &quot;10 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1994&quot; list.

In April 2019, the EP was ranked No. 42 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Grunge Albums&quot; list.

==Influence==
&quot;Jar of Flies&quot; served as inspiration for Strung Out&#x27;s 2018 acoustic EP, &quot;Black Out the Sky&quot;.

Cane Hill&#x27;s lead vocalist Elijah Witt said that &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was a major influence on the band&#x27;s 2019 acoustic EP, &quot;Kill the Sun&quot;.

<text>The Seven-Per-Cent Solution: Being a Reprint from the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D. is a 1974 novel by American writer Nicholas Meyer. It is written as a pastiche of a Sherlock Holmes adventure, and was made into a film of the same name in 1976.

Published as a &quot;lost manuscript&quot; of the late Dr. John H. Watson, the book recounts Holmes&#x27; recovery from cocaine addiction (with the help of Sigmund Freud) and his subsequent prevention of a European war through the unravelling of a sinister kidnapping plot. It was followed by four other Holmes pastiches by Meyer, &quot;The West End Horror&quot; (1976), &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; (1993), &quot;The Adventure of the Peculiar Protocols&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Return of the Pharaoh&quot; (2021) none of which have been adapted to film.

&quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot; was ranked ninth in the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; list of bestselling novels from 1974 and made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for forty weeks between September 15, 1974, and June 22, 1975.

==Plot==
An introduction states that two canonical Holmes adventures were fabrications. These are &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, in which Holmes apparently died along with Prof. James Moriarty, and &quot;The Empty House&quot;, wherein Holmes reappeared after a three-year absence and revealed that he had not been killed after all. &quot;The Seven-Per-Cent Solution&quot;&#x27;s Watson explains that they were published to conceal the truth concerning Holmes&#x27; &quot;Great Hiatus&quot;.

The novel begins in 1891, when Holmes first informs Watson of his belief that Professor James Moriarty is a &quot;Napoleon of Crime&quot;. The novel presents this view as nothing more than the fevered imagining of Holmes&#x27; cocaine-sodden mind and further asserts that Moriarty was the childhood mathematics tutor of Sherlock and his brother Mycroft. Watson meets Moriarty, who denies that he is a criminal and reluctantly threatens to pursue legal action unless the latter&#x27;s accusations cease. Moriarty also refers to a &quot;great tragedy&quot; in Holmes&#x27; childhood, but refuses to explain further when pressed by Watson.

The heart of the novel consists of an account of Holmes&#x27; recovery from his addiction. Knowing that Sherlock would never willingly see a doctor about his addiction and mental problems, Watson and Holmes&#x27; brother Mycroft induce Holmes to travel to Vienna, where Watson introduces him to Dr. Freud. Using a treatment consisting largely of hypnosis, Freud helps Holmes shake off his addiction and his delusions about Moriarty, but neither he nor Watson can revive Holmes&#x27; dejected spirit.

What finally does the job is a whiff of mystery: one of the doctor&#x27;s patients is kidnapped and Holmes&#x27; curiosity is sufficiently aroused. The case takes the three men on a breakneck train ride across Austria in pursuit of a foe who is about to launch a war involving all of Europe. Holmes remarks during the denouement that they have succeeded only in postponing such a conflict, not preventing it; Holmes would later become involved in a &quot;European War&quot; in 1914.

One final hypnosis session reveals a key traumatic event in Holmes&#x27; childhood: his father murdered his mother for adultery and committed suicide afterwards. Moriarty was his mother&#x27;s lover, having fled sometime before the murder. From that point on, his onetime tutor became a dark and malignant figure in Holmes&#x27; subconscious. Freud and Watson conclude that Holmes, consciously unable to face the emotional ramifications of this event, has pushed them deep into his unconscious while finding outlets in fighting evil, pursuing justice, and many of his famous eccentricities, including his cocaine habit. However, they decide not to discuss these subjects with Holmes, believing that he would not accept them, and that it would needlessly complicate his recovery.

Watson returns to London, but Holmes decides to travel alone for a while, advising Watson to claim that he had been killed, and thus the famed &quot;Great Hiatus&quot; is more or less preserved. It is during these travels that the events of Meyer&#x27;s sequel &quot;The Canary Trainer&quot; occur.

==Publication history==
During the 1973 scriptwriters strike, Nicholas Meyer needed a project to occupy his time. Meyer developed an interest in Sherlock Holmes as a teenager and off-and-on over the years had given thought to authoring a story where Sherlock Holmes meets Sigmund Freud, having learned of the founder of psychoanalysis from his psychiatrist father. The strike was the impetus to settle into developing the various ideas he had over the years into a book.

Meyer wrote the book in longhand and then typed it up feeling that this better put him in the mindset of &quot;editing&quot; Watson&#x27;s words. He added deliberate continuity errors and mistakes to better provide the illusion of being an extension of the original works.

==References to other works==
Holmes&#x27;s addiction to cocaine is developed out of the opening scene of Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;. In that scene, Holmes describes the cocaine with which he is injecting himself as &quot;a seven-per-cent solution.&quot;

In his Introduction, Meyer&#x27;s Watson declares that &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot;, &quot;The Creeping Man&quot; and &quot;The Three Gables&quot; (all Arthur Conan Doyle-written adventures from 1927&#x27;s &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;) are forged &quot;drivel&quot;. &quot;The Creeping Man&quot; has been accused of resembling a science-fiction tale more than a Holmes adventure, &quot;The Mazarin Stone&quot; is often viewed as an awkward adaptation of a theatrical script by Doyle and some have objected to a racist characterization in &quot;The Three Gables&quot;. &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot;, while perhaps less controversial than the other tales, is notable for being one of the canon&#x27;s two stories narrated by Holmes. Meyer&#x27;s Watson also states that other forgeries exist, though whether canonical works are concerned is not specified.

On the train to Vienna, Holmes and Watson briefly meet Rudolf Rassendyll, the fictional protagonist of the 1894 novel &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, returning from his adventures in Ruritania.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
The story was adapted for the screen in 1976 in a Universal Studios production, directed by Herbert Ross, scripted by Meyer and designed by James Bond veteran Ken Adam. The all-star cast featured Nicol Williamson as Holmes, Robert Duvall as Watson, Alan Arkin as Dr. Sigmund Freud, with Laurence Olivier as Moriarty, Charles Gray as Mycroft Holmes (the role he reprised in the Jeremy Brett TV series), Samantha Eggar as Mary Watson, Vanessa Redgrave as Lola Devereaux, Joel Grey as Lowenstein, and Jeremy Kemp as Baron von Leinsdorf and Williamson&#x27;s then wife Jill Townsend playing his character&#x27;s mother (Mrs. Holmes). The film was made at Pinewood Studios with location shooting in the UK and Austria (including the famous Austrian National Library); the tennis match/duel between Freud and von Leinsdorf was filmed on one of the historic real tennis courts at the Queen&#x27;s Club in West Kensington, London. The chase on the trains was shot with set-dressed British steam locomotives and freight cars dressed up as coaches.

Meyer adapted his novel to screenplay form, but the film differs significantly from the novel, mainly by supplementing the book&#x27;s Austrian baron-villain (played by Jeremy Kemp) with an older Turkish foe. Also, the film departs from traditional Holmes canon in portraying the detective as light-haired instead of the traditional black-haired, and as a somewhat flirtatious Holmes at that (Doyle&#x27;s hero never let women see any signs of interest). Furthermore, the traumatic revelation that affected Holmes in his childhood is heightened – the final hypnosis therapy reveals that Sherlock witnessed his mother&#x27;s murder by his father. Finally, the lady whom Holmes saves in the story&#x27;s climactic chase, Lola Devereaux, appears on his ship as he departs for his sabbatical with the purpose of joining him and Holmes eagerly accepts the offer. Meyer&#x27;s three Holmes novels are much more faithful to the original stories in these regards.

===Radio===
The story was dramatised for radio by Denny Martin Flinn. The adaptation aired on BBC Radio 4 on 9 January 1993. It was directed by Jane Morga, with Simon Callow as Sherlock Holmes, Ian Hogg as Dr Watson, Karl Johnson as Sigmund Freud, David King as Professor Moriarty, Philip Voss as Mycroft Holmes, Matthew Morgan as Baron von Leinsdorf, Melinda Walker as Nancy Osborn Slater, Geraldine Fitzgerald as Baroness von Leinsdorf, and Wolf Kahler as Hugo von Hoffmansthal. The radio adaptation was more faithful to the novel than the film adaptation.

<text>Indian literature refers to the literature produced on the Indian subcontinent until 1947 and in the Republic of India thereafter. The Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India has 22 officially recognised languages. Sahitya Akademi, India&#x27;s highest literary body, also has 24 recognised literary languages.

The earliest works of Indian literature were orally transmitted. Sanskrit literature begins with the oral literature of the Rig Veda, a collection of literature dating to the period 1500–1200 BCE. The Sanskrit epics &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; were subsequently codified and appeared towards the end of the 2nd millennium BCE. Classical Sanskrit literature developed rapidly during the first few centuries of the first millennium BCE, as did the Pāli Canon and Tamil Sangam literature. Ancient Meitei appeared in the 1st century CE with sacred musical compositions like the Ougri, and heroic narratives like the Numit Kappa. 
In the medieval period, literature in Kannada and Telugu appeared in the 9th and 10th centuries, respectively. Later, literature in Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali, Assamese, Odia, and Maithili appeared. Thereafter literature in various dialects of Hindi, Persian and Urdu began to appear as well. In 1913, Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore became India&#x27;s first Nobel laureate in literature.

==In archaic and ancient Indian languages==
=== Sanskrit literature ===
====Vedic literature====

Examples of early works written in Vedic Sanskrit include, the core Vedas and Upanishads. Other examples include the Sulba Sutras, which are some of the earliest texts on geometry.

====Epic Sanskrit literature====

Ved Vyasa&#x27;s &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and Valmiki&#x27;s &quot;Ramayana&quot;, written in Epic Sanskrit, are regarded as the greatest Sanskrit epics.

====Classical Sanskrit literature====

The famous poet and playwright Kālidāsa wrote one epic: &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot; (&quot;Dynasty of Raghu&quot;); it was written in Classical Sanskrit rather than Epic Sanskrit. Other examples of works written in Classical Sanskrit include the Pāṇini&#x27;s &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;, which standardised the grammar and phonetics of Classical Sanskrit. The &quot;Laws of Manu&quot; (मनुस्मृति) is a famous text in Hinduism. Kālidāsa is often considered to be the greatest playwright in Sanskrit literature and one of the greatest poets in Sanskrit literature; his &quot;Recognition of Shakuntala&quot; (अभिज्ञानशाकुन्तलम्) and &quot;Meghaduuta&quot; are Kalidasa&#x27;s most famous play and poem respectively. Other famous plays include &quot;Mricchakatika&quot; by Shudraka, &quot;Svapna Vasavadattam&quot; by Bhasa, and &quot;Ratnavali&quot; by Sri Harsha. Later poetic works include &quot;Gita Govinda&quot; by Jayadeva. Some other famous works are Chanakya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; and Vatsyayana&#x27;s &quot;Kamasutra&quot;.

====Classical Odia literature====

=== Ancient Meitei literature ===

Some of the ancient literature of Meitei language (also known as Manipuri language) include the Ougri ( musical composition), the Numit Kappa ( narrative work), the Poireiton Khunthok ( narrative work), the &quot;Khencho&quot; (pre-7th century CE musical composition), 6th-7th century CE copper plate inscriptions of king Khongtekcha, the Panthoibi Khonggul ( narrative work), the Loiyumpa Silyel (c. Written Constitution drafted in 429 CE, and finalised in 11th-12th century CE), etc.

===Prakrit literature===

Many of Aśvaghoṣa&#x27;s plays were written in Shauraseni as were a sizable number of Jain works and Rajasekhara&#x27;s &quot;Karpuramanjari&quot;. Canto 13 of the Bhaṭṭikāvya is written in what is called &quot;like the vernacular&quot; (&quot;bhāṣāsama&quot;), that is, it can be read in two languages simultaneously: Prakrit and Sanskrit.

===Pali literature===
The canonical Pali literature includes Buddhist discourses (&quot;suttas&quot;), Abhidharma works, poetry, works on monastic discipline (&quot;vinaya&quot;), and the &quot;Jataka tales&quot;.

===Tamil literature===
====Sangam literature====
The Sangam literature (Tamil: சங்க இலக்கியம், &quot;Sanga ilakkiyam)&quot; is the ancient Tamil literature of the period in the history of south India (known as the Thamizhagam or the Tamilagam) spanning from to 300 CE (Akananuru (1, 15, 31, 55, 61, 65, 91, 97, 101, 115, 127, 187, 197, 201, 211, 233, 251, 265, 281, 311, 325, 331, 347, 349, 359, 393, 281, 295), Kurunthogai (11), Natrinai (14, 75) are dated before 300 BCE). This collection contains 2381 poems in Tamil composed by 473 poets, some 102 of whom remain anonymous.

Most of the available Sangam literature is from the Third Sangam, this period is known as the Sangam period, which refers to the prevalent Sangam legends claiming literary academies lasting thousands of years, giving the name to the corpus of literature. The Only religious poems among the shorter poems occur in &quot;paripaatal&quot;. The rest of the corpus of Sangam literature deals with human relationship and emotions.

Sangam literature deals with emotional and material topics such as love, war, governance, trade and bereavement. Some of the greatest Tamil scholars, like Thiruvalluvar, who wrote on ethics, and on the various issues of life like virtue, wealth and love, or the Tamil poet Mamulanar, who explored historical incidents that happened in India, lived during the Sangam period.

====Bhakti literature====
The Bhakti movement was a significant religious movement in medieval Hinduism that sought to bring religious reforms to all strata of society by adopting the method of devotion to achieve salvation. Originating in Tamilakam during 6th century CE, it gained prominence through the poems and teachings of the Vaishnava Alvars and Shaiva Nayanars before spreading northwards. It swept over east and north India from the 15th century onwards, reaching its zenith between the 15th and 17th century CE. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India&#x27;s literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the spread of the Bhakti movement in the northern parts of India, resulting in the emergence of devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions.

== In modern Indian languages ==
=== Sahitya Akademi recognised &amp; scheduled languages ===
====Assamese literature====


The Buddhist Charyapadas are often cited as the earliest example of Assamese literature. The Charyapadas are Vajrayana Buddhist songs composed in the 8th to 12th centuries. These writings bear similarities to Oriya and Bengali languages as well. The phonological and morphological traits of these songs, some of which are extant, bear very strong resemblance to Assamese.

A comprehensive introductory book &quot;Assamese Language-Literature &amp; Sahityarathi Lakshminath Bezbaroa&quot; originally authored by leading Assamese littérateur of &quot;Awahon-Ramdhenu Era&quot; and pioneer Assam economist Bhabananda Deka together with his three deputies, Parikshit Hazarika, Upendra Nath Goswami and Prabhat Chandra Sarma, was published in 1968. This book was officially released in New Delhi on 24 Nov 1968 by then President of India Zakir Husain in commemoration of the birth centenary celebration of doyen of Assamese literature Lakshminath Bezbaroa. After almost half a century, this historic book has been recovered and re-edited by Assamese award-winning short-story writer &amp; novelist Arnab Jan Deka, which was published by Assam Foundation-India in 2014.

====Bengali literature====

The first evidence of Bengali literature is known as Charyapada or Charyageeti, which were Buddhist hymns from the 8th century. Charyapada is in the oldest known written form of Bengali. The famous Bengali linguist Hara Prasad Shastri discovered the palm leaf Charyapada manuscript in the Nepal Royal Court Library in 1907.
The most internationally famous Bengali writer is Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913 for his work &quot;Gitanjali&quot;. He wrote the national anthem of India and Bangladesh namely, &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; and &quot;Amar Sonar Bangla&quot;, respectively. He was the first Asian who won the Nobel Prize.
Rabindranath has written an enormous number of poems, songs, essays, novels, plays and short stories. His songs remain popular and are still widely sung in Bengal.

====Hindi literature====

Hindi literature started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like Avadhi and Brij. The most famous figures from this period are Kabir and Tulsidas. In modern times, the Dehlavi dialect of the Hindi Belt became more prominent than Sanskrit.

====Gujarati literature====
Gujarati literature&#x27;s history may be traced to 1000 CE.

====Kannada literature====

The oldest existing record of Kannada prose is the Halmidi inscription of 450 CE, and poetry in &quot;tripadi&quot; metre is the Kappe Arabhatta record of 700 CE. The folk form of literature began earlier than any other literature in Kannada. &quot;Gajashtaka&quot; (800 CE) by King Shivamara II, &quot;Chudamani&quot; (650 CE) by Thumbalacharya are examples of early literature now considered extinct. &quot;Kavirajamarga&quot; by King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I (850 CE) is the earliest existing literary work in Kannada. It is a writing on literary criticism and poetics meant to standardise various written Kannada dialects used in literature in previous centuries. The book makes reference to Kannada works by early writers such as King Durvinita of the 6th century and Ravikirti, the author of the Aihole record of 636 CE. An early extant prose work, the &quot;Vaddaradhane&quot; by Shivakotiacharya of 900 CE provides an elaborate description of the life of Bhadrabahu of Shravanabelagola. Since the earliest available Kannada work is one on grammar and a guide of sorts to unify existing variants of Kannada grammar and literary styles, it can be safely assumed that literature in Kannada must have started several centuries earlier.
Pampa who popularised Champu style which is unique to Kannada wrote the epic &quot;Vikramarjuna Vijaya&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Adipurana&quot;. Other famous poets like Ponna wrote &quot;shantinatapurana&quot;, &quot;Bhuvanaikaramabhyudaya&quot;, &quot;Jinaksharamale&quot;, and &quot;gatapratyagata&quot;. Ranna wrote &quot;Shantipurana&quot; and &quot;Ghadayudha&quot;. The Jain poet Nagavarma II wrote &quot;Kavyavalokana&quot;, &quot;Karnatabhashabhushana&quot; and &quot;Vardhamanapurana&quot; . Janna was the author of &quot;Yashodhara Charitha&quot;. Rudhrabhatta and Durgashima wrote &quot;Jagannatha Vijaya&quot; and &quot;Panchatantra&quot; respectively. The works of the medieval period are based on Jain and Hindu principles. The Vachana Sahitya tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature.

====Kashmiri literature====
====Konkani literature====
Konkani is a language with a complex and much-contested history. It is one of the few Indian languages to be written in five scripts—Roman, Nagari, Kannada, Persian-Arabic and Malayalam-and also has an extensive oral literature.

====Malayalam literature====

Even up to 500 years since the start of the Malayalam calendar which commenced in 825 CE, Malayalam literature remained in preliminary stage. During this time, Malayalam literature consisted mainly of various genres of songs.

====Maithili literature====
Maithili literature is the entire collection of poetry, novels, short stories, documents and other writings in the Maithili language.

The Maithili script, Mithilakshara or Tirhuta as it is popularly known, is of a great antiquity. The &quot;Lalitavistara&quot; mentions the Vaidehi script. Early in the latter half of the 7th century CE, a marked change occurred in the northeastern alphabet, and the inscriptions of Adityasena exhibit this change for the first time. The eastern variety develops and becomes the Maithili script, which comes into use in Assam, Bengal, and Nepal. The earliest recorded epigraphic evidence of the script is found in the Mandar Hill Stone inscriptions of Adityasena in the 7th century CE, now fixed in the Baidyanath temple of Deoghar.

The language of the Buddhist dohas is described as belonging to the mixed Maithili—Kamrupi language.

==== Modern Meitei literature ====

Modern Meitei literature, the descendant of Ancient Meitei literature, is written in modern Meitei language (also known as Manipuri language), composed by writers from Manipur, Assam, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The history of Meitei literature can be traced back to thousands of years with the flourish of Meitei civilization. , the third longest Indian epic poem, next to the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, is a Meitei epic poem, based on the classic tale of Khamba and Thoibi, having 39,000 lines, is regarded as the national epic of the Manipuris.

====Marathi literature====

Marathi literature began with saint-poets like Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, Ramdas, and Eknath. Modern Marathi literature was marked by a theme of social reform.

====Nepali literature====
====Odia literature====

Odia is another ancient and rich language among the various language groups in the Indian subcontinent. Ashokan Inscriptions of 3rd cenctury BC at Dhauli and Jaugarh is the ancient unchanged evidence of Odia language. Odia language literary history started with the Kharavel&#x27;s Hatigumpha inscription (40 B.C.) was the real evidence of past Odia cultural, political, ritual and social status and it is the first poetic stake inscription. Though Ashoka created many rock edicts and inscriptions before Kharavela, his instructions for administration were written in a rude and chocked language. On the other hand, the Hatigumpha inscriptions show the flexibility of a language in a sweet flow.
The buddhist charyapadas written in the 7th century CE on the period of Bhauma-Kara dynasty . Odia has a rich literary heritage, the medieval period dating back to the 13th century. Sarala Das who lived in the 14th century is known as the Vyasa of Odisha. He translated the Mahabharata into Odia.

====Punjabi literature====

The first work considered to be Punjabi literature is &lt;mark&gt;the 16th century biography of Guru Nanak, Janam-sakhi, written by his companion Bhai Bala&lt;/mark&gt;. However, some say that Punjabi literature may have evolved much earlier, perhaps in the 9th or 10th centuries, based on the high level of Punjabi poetry written by Baba Farid, Guru Nanak, and Bhai Gurdas. Baba Farid (1173–1266) is often considered the first major Punjabi poet, and his Sufi poetry was compiled after his death in the Adi Granth.

<text>Herbert Stein (August 27, 1916 – September 8, 1999) was an American economist, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, and a member of the board of contributors of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. From 1974 to 1984, he was the A. Willis Robertson Professor of Economics at the University of Virginia.

==Biography==

Stein was born on August 27, 1916, in Detroit, Michigan, and his family moved to New York during the Great Depression. He enrolled in Williams College just before he turned 16. After graduating with Phi Beta Kappa honors, he went to Washington, DC, to work as an economist in various agencies. He received his PhD in economics from the University of Chicago in 1958.

Stein, who died September 8, 1999, in Washington, DC, was married to Mildred Stein, who died in 1997 after 61 years of marriage. He is the father of the lawyer, author, and actor Ben Stein and the writer Rachel Stein. Herbert Stein was also the original writer for the advice column Dear Prudence.

==Views==
Stein was known as a pragmatic conservative and was referred to as &quot;a liberal&#x27;s conservative and a conservative&#x27;s liberal.&quot; He was the author of &quot;The Fiscal Revolution in America&quot;.

In one article, Stein wrote that the people who wore an &quot;Adam Smith necktie&quot; did so to:

make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government. What stands out in [Smith&#x27;s seminal work] &quot;Wealth of Nations,&quot; however, is that their patron saint was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism. He regarded his exposition of the virtues of the free market as his main contribution to policy, and the purpose for which his economic analysis was developed. Yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system.

=== Stein&#x27;s Law===
Stein propounded Stein&#x27;s Law, which he expressed in 1986 as &quot;If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.&quot; Stein observed this logic in analyzing economic trends (such as rising US federal debt in proportion to GDP, or increasing international balance of payments deficits, in his analysis): if such a process is limited by external factors, there is no urgency for government intervention to stop it, much less to make it stop immediately, but it will stop of its own accord. A paraphrase, not attributed to Stein, is &quot;Trends that can&#x27;t continue indefinitely won&#x27;t.&quot;

<doc id="567130" wikidata="Q7113779" url="?curid=567130" title="Female infanticide">
<text>Female infanticide is the deliberate killing of newborn female children. Female infanticide is prevalent in several nations around the world. It has been argued that the low status in which women are viewed in patriarchal societies creates a bias against females. The modern practice of gender-selective abortion is also used to regulate gender ratios.

In 1978, anthropologist Laila Williamson, in a summary of data she had collated on how widespread infanticide was, found that infanticide had occurred on every continent and was carried out by groups ranging from hunter gatherers to highly developed societies, and that, rather than this practice being an exception, it has been commonplace. The practice has been documented among the Indigenous peoples of Australia, Northern Alaska and South Asia, and Barbara Miller argues the practice to be &quot;almost universal&quot;, even in the Western world. Miller contends that female infanticide is commonplace in regions where women are not employed in agriculture and regions in which dowries are the norm. In 1871, in &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;, Charles Darwin wrote that the practice was commonplace among the aboriginal tribes of Australia. Female infanticide is also closely linked to a lack of education and high poverty rates, which explains why it is widely prevalent in locations such as India, Pakistan, and West Africa.

In 1990, Amartya Sen writing in the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot; estimated that there were 100 million fewer women in Asia than would be expected, and that this number of &quot;missing&quot; women &quot;tell[s] us, quietly, a terrible story of inequality and neglect leading to the excess mortality of women&quot;.

== Regional occurrence ==

=== China ===

China has a history of female infanticide spanning 2,000 years. With the arrival of Christian missionaries in the late sixteenth century, the missionaries discovered female infanticide was being practiced – newborns were seen thrown into rivers or onto rubbish piles. In the seventeenth century, Matteo Ricci documented that the practice occurred in several of China&#x27;s provinces and that the primary reason for the practice was poverty.

In 19th-century China, female infanticide was widespread. Readings from Qing texts show a prevalence of the term &quot;nì nǚ&quot; (&quot;to drown girls&quot;), and drowning was the common method used to kill female children. Other methods used were suffocation and starvation. Leaving a child exposed to the elements was another method of killing an infant: the child would be placed in a basket which was then placed in a tree. Buddhist nunneries created &quot;baby towers&quot; for people to leave a child; it is however unclear as to whether the child was being left for adoption or if it had already died and was being left for burial. In 1845 in the province of Jiangxi, a missionary wrote that these children survived for up to two days while exposed to the elements, and that those passing by would pay no attention.
The majority of China&#x27;s provinces practiced female infanticide during the 19th century. In 1878, French Jesuit missionary Gabriel Palatre collected documents from 13 provinces, and the Annales de la Sainte-Enfance (Annals of the Holy Childhood) also found evidence of infanticide in Shanxi and Sichuan. According to the information collected by Palatre, the practice was more widely spread in the southeastern provinces and in the Lower Yangzi River region.

In China, the practice of female infanticide was not wholly condoned. Buddhism in particular was quite forceful in its condemnation of it. Buddhists wrote that the killing of young girls would bring bad karma; conversely, those who saved a young girl&#x27;s life either through intervening or through presents of money or food would earn good karma, leading to a prosperous life, a long life and success for their sons. However the Buddhist belief in reincarnation meant that the death of an infant was not final, as the child would be reborn; this belief eased the guilt felt over female infanticide.

The Confucian attitude towards female infanticide was conflicted. By placing value on age over youth, Confucian filial piety lessened the value of children. The Confucian emphasis on the family led to increasing dowries which in turn led to a girl being far more expensive to raise than a boy, causing families to feel they could not afford as many daughters. The Confucian custom of keeping the male within the family meant that the money spent on a daughter&#x27;s upbringing along with the dowry would be lost when she married, and as such girls were called &quot;money-losing merchandise&quot;. Conversely the Confucian belief of Ren led Confucian intellectuals to support the idea that female infanticide was wrong and that the practice would upset the balance between yin and yang.

A white paper published by the Chinese government in 1980 stated that the practice of female infanticide was a &quot;feudalistic evil&quot;. The state&#x27;s official position on the practice is that it is a carryover from feudal times, and is not a result of the states one-child policy. Jing-Bao Nie argues however that it would be &quot;inconceivable&quot; to believe there is no link between the state&#x27;s family planning policies and female infanticide.

=== India ===
The dowry system in India is one given reason for female infanticide; over a time period spanning centuries it has become embedded within Indian culture. Although the state has taken steps to abolish the dowry system, the practice persists, and for poorer families in rural regions female infanticide and gender selective abortion is attributed to the fear of being unable to raise a suitable dowry and then being socially ostracized.

In 1789, during British colonial rule in India the British discovered that female infanticide in Uttar Pradesh was openly acknowledged. A letter from a magistrate who was stationed in the North West of India during this period spoke of the fact that for several hundred years no daughter had ever been raised in the strongholds of the Rajahs of Mynpoorie. In 1845, however the ruler at that time did keep a daughter alive after a district collector named Unwin intervened. A review of scholarship has shown that the majority of female infanticides in India during the colonial period occurred for the most part in the North West, and that although not all groups carried out this practice, it was indeed widespread. In 1870, after an investigation by the colonial authorities the practice was made illegal, with the Female Infanticide Prevention Act, 1870.

According to women&#x27;s rights activist Donna Fernandes, some practices are so deeply embedded within Indian culture it is &quot;almost impossible to do away with them&quot;, and she has said that India is undergoing a type of &quot;female genocide&quot;. The United Nations has declared that India is the most deadly country for female children, and that in 2012, female children aged between 1 and 5 were 75 percent more likely to die as opposed to boys. The children&#x27;s rights group CRY has estimated that of the 12 million females born yearly in India, 1 million will have died within their first year of life. During British rule, the practice of female infanticide in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu among the Kallars and the Todas was reported. More recently in June 1986, it was reported by &quot;India Today&quot; in a cover story &quot;Born to Die&quot; that female infanticide was still in practice in Usilampatti in southern Tamil Nadu. The practice was mostly prevalent among the dominant caste of the region, Kallars.

=== Pakistan ===
Despite this practice being punishable according to Islamic law, there have been cases of female infanticide in Pakistan due to a few reasons, for example, children being born out of wedlock and then killed to avoid the stigma of illegitimacy. Pakistan is still a male-dominated nation and remains a patriarchal society. In addition, the boys in the family are given preferential treatment, receiving food and medical care before the girls do. Having a child out of wedlock in Pakistan is culturally taboo. When women give birth to their babies, they often kill them to escape the shame or persecution. However, the ratio of female babies being killed in these cases is much higher than the boys because boys are much more valued. Infanticide is illegal in Pakistan. However, people do not report these cases, making it impossible for police to investigate. According to &quot;National Right to Live News&quot;, in 2017, only one case was actually reported, but 345 babies were found dead in Pakistan&#x27;s capital between January 2017 and Spring of 2018.

== Socio-economics ==
Eliminating females poses an issue, as this reduces the number of females that will be able to bear children. It also poses an issue with feelings of female worth, as families wanting to eradicate female babies teach the young girls in their society that they are inferior to the opposite sex, making it more likely that they face oppression and have reduced access to jobs. The dowry system has an effect on the families and poverty line, as some families struggle to pay a dowry while earning below the minimum wage.

As of 2017, Pakistani women earn less than their male counterparts, earning under a hundred rupees a month, and are often unable to receive an education that would allow them to have better working hours and pay. Some are also restricted to only working within the home, while men are allowed to do the majority of crop work and herding.

In many countries, female infanticide is associated with socio-economic struggles. A study done in India found three socio-economic reasons associated with female infanticide. The study found that economic utility indicates that boys are valued more than girls due to the fact that boys can work and bring in money to the household. Due to the sociocultural utility factor of female infanticide, for many cultures having a boy in the family is mandatory in order to carry out the legacy of the family line. There is also a religious factor in female infanticide. Many believe that men are the only ones that can provide, and sons are viewed as mandatory in order to kindle the funeral pyre of their late parents and to assist in the soul&#x27;s salvation.

== Solutions and programs ==

Non-Government Developmental Organizations (NGDOs) have gender awareness policies designed to prevent female discrimination all over the world. These NGDOs approach corporations in an attempt to educate those in the workforce on the pressing challenges women in society face. Other than increasing education regarding this issue, another noteworthy solution to female infanticide involves targeting the dowry system. Many societies oppose female children because of the heavy cost of dowry they would have to incur for a female. By reducing the financial burden on families, the eradication of the dowry system could therefore potentially reduce the apparent preference of male children as well as female infanticide rates.

Another way of decreasing female infanticide rates is by providing families with incentives to give birth to females. India&#x27;s Girl Child Protection Scheme is one such scheme that encourages female births by providing families with financial support if they give birth to female children and additional support to those families whose children receive an education. This improves female literacy rates and increases female participation in the workforce, reducing female foeticide rates in underdeveloped countries.

Implementing gender education within schools and the workplace will add to gender neutrality within society, increasing the value of women. Sympathizing with women&#x27;s suffrage in countries limiting women&#x27;s rights will add to the battle in which women fight for freedoms in their home state. Building upon gender equality in education and teaching women strategies to cope with their situations will help them grow confidence and want to spread their knowledge and passions with their female children. The issue with female infanticide is that women devalue their own gender. When mothers give away their female children, it only adds to the lesser image of women. Having women respect themselves and their own children for who they are will increase the population, and it will increase the value of women. It may take a long time to implement these changes in society, but societal revision is a slow process. Education, value in life, and passion for gender are all aspects of decreasing female infanticide. Having locations to rid of a female child, such as &quot;The Girl Child Protection Scheme&quot;, appears as a step toward change. This program only adds to the availability and opportunity for female infanticide. Instrumentalizing gender education and value of life will greatly inspire change in societies that participate in such process of termination.

== Consequences and reactions ==

As a result of large high female infanticide rates in countries, the population is often skewed with a larger proportion of males. According to the United Nations, this surplus of men in society coincides with increasing rates of child abuse, domestic violence, and bride trafficking/kidnapping, presenting a grave threat to the security of women in the affected areas. This also increases the likelihood of women becoming victims of harmful sexually transmitted diseases, which further adversely affects their lives as well as population rates. Owing to these concerning issues, there is also a concerning boost in maternal mortality rates and an increase in mental health conditions among women in these locations.

The Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) wrote in their 2005 report, &quot;Women in an Insecure World&quot;, that at a time when the number of casualties in war had fallen, a &quot;secret genocide&quot; was being carried out against women. According to DCAF the demographic shortfall of women who have died for gender related issues is in the same range as the 191 million estimated dead from all conflicts in the twentieth century. In 2012, the documentary &quot;It&#x27;s a Girl: The Three Deadliest Words in the World&quot; was released, and in one interview, an Indian woman claimed she had killed eight of her daughters.

<text>A biodiversity hotspot is a biogeographic region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by human habitation. Norman Myers wrote about the concept in two articles in &quot;The Environmentalist&quot; in 1988 and 1990, after which the concept was revised following thorough analysis by Myers and others into &quot;Hotspots: Earth&#x27;s Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions&quot; and a paper published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, both in 2000.

To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot on Myers&#x27; 2000 edition of the hotspot map, a region must meet two strict criteria: it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (more than 0.5% of the world&#x27;s total) as endemics, and it has to have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetation. Globally, 36 zones qualify under this definition. These sites support nearly 60% of the world&#x27;s plant, bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species, with a high share of those species as endemics. Some of these hotspots support up to 15,000 endemic plant species, and some have lost up to 95% of their natural habitat.

Biodiversity hotspots host their diverse ecosystems on just 2.4% of the planet&#x27;s surface. Ten hotspots were originally identified by Myer; the current 36 used to cover more than 15.7% of all the land but have lost around 85% of their area. This loss of habitat is why approximately 60% of the world&#x27;s terrestrial life lives on only 2.4% of the land surface area. Caribbean Islands like Haiti and Jamaica are facing serious pressures on the populations of endemic plants and vertebrates as a result of rapid deforestation. Other areas include the Tropical Andes, Philippines, Mesoamerica, and Sundaland, which, under the current levels at which deforestation is occurring, will likely lose most of their plant and vertebrate species.

==Hotspot conservation initiatives==
Only a small percentage of the total land area within biodiversity hotspots is now protected. Several international organizations are working to conserve biodiversity hotspots.
* Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (CEPF) is a global program that provides funding and technical assistance to nongovernmental organizations in order to protect the Earth&#x27;s richest regions of plant and animal diversity, including biodiversity hotspots, high-biodiversity wilderness areas and important marine regions.
* The World Wide Fund for Nature has devised a system called the &quot;Global 200 Ecoregions&quot;, the aim of which is to select priority ecoregions for conservation from fourteen terrestrial, three freshwater, and four marine habitat types. They are chosen for species richness, endemism, taxonomic uniqueness, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity. All biodiversity hotspots contain at least one Global 200 Ecoregion.
* Birdlife International has identified 218 &quot;Endemic Bird Areas&quot; (EBAs) each of which holds two or more bird species found nowhere else. Birdlife International has identified more than 11,000 Important Bird Areas all over the world.
* Plant life International coordinates programs aiming to identify and manage Important Plant Areas.
* Alliance for Zero Extinction is an initiative of scientific organizations and conservation groups who co-operate to focus on the most threatened endemic species of the world. They have identified 595 sites, including many &quot;Birdlife&#x27;s Important Bird Areas&quot;.
* The National Geographic Society has prepared a world map of the hotspots and ArcView shapefile and metadata for the Biodiversity Hotspots including details of the individual endangered fauna in each hotspot, which is available from Conservation International.
* The Compensatory Afforestation Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) seeks to control the destruction of forests in India.

==Distribution by region==
Most biodiversity exists within the tropics; likewise, most hotspots are tropical. Of the 36 biodiversity hotspots, 15 are classified as old, climatically-buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). These areas have been historically isolated from interactions with other climate zones, but recent human interaction and encroachment have put these historically safe hotspots at risk. OCBILs have mainly been threatened by the relocation of indigenous groups and military actions, as the infertile ground has previously dissuaded human populations. The conservation of OCBILs within biodiversity hotspots has started to garner attention because current theories believe these sites provide not only high levels of biodiversity, but they have relatively stable lineages and the potential for high levels of speciation in the future. Because these sites are relatively stable, they can be classified as refugia.

==Criticism==
The high profile of the biodiversity hotspots approach has resulted in some criticism. Papers such as Kareiva &amp; Marvier (2003) have pointed out that biodiversity hotspots (and many other priority region sets) do not address the concept of cost, and do not consider phylogenetic diversity.
