<text>The history of feminism comprises the narratives (chronological or thematic) of the movements and ideologies which have aimed at equal rights for women. While feminists around the world have differed in causes, goals, and intentions depending on time, culture, and country, most Western feminist historians assert that all movements that work to obtain women&#x27;s rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves. Some other historians limit the term &quot;feminist&quot; to the modern feminist movement and its progeny, and use the label &quot;protofeminist&quot; to describe earlier movements.

Modern Western feminist history is conventionally split into time periods, or &quot;waves&quot;, each with slightly different aims based on prior progress:

* First-wave feminism of the 19th and early 20th centuries focused on overturning legal inequalities, particularly addressing issues of women&#x27;s suffrage
* Second-wave feminism (1960s–1980s) broadened debate to include cultural inequalities, gender norms, and the role of women in society
* Third-wave feminism (1990s–2000s) refers to diverse strains of feminist activity, seen by third-wavers themselves both as a continuation of the second wave and as a response to its perceived failures
* Fourth-wave feminism (early 2010s–present) expands on the third wave&#x27;s focus on intersectionality, emphasizing body positivity, trans-inclusivity, and an open discourse about rape culture in the social media era

Although the &quot;waves&quot; construct has been commonly used to describe the history of feminism, the concept has also been criticized by non-White feminists for ignoring and erasing the history between the &quot;waves&quot;, by choosing to focus solely on a few famous figures, on the perspective of a white bourgeois woman and on popular events, and for being racist and colonialist.

== Early feminism ==
People and activists who discuss or advance women&#x27;s equality prior to the existence of the feminist movement are sometimes labeled as &quot;protofeminist&quot;. Some scholars criticize this term because they believe it diminishes the importance of earlier contributions or that feminism does not have a single begin or linear history as implied by terms such as &quot;protofeminist&quot; or &quot;postfeminist&quot;.

Around 24 centuries ago, Plato, according to Elaine Hoffman Baruch, &quot;[argued] for the total political and sexual equality of women, advocating that they be members of his highest class, ... those who rule and fight&quot;.

Andal, a female Tamil saint, lived around the 7th or 8th century. She is well known for writing &quot;Tiruppavai&quot;. Andal has inspired women&#x27;s groups such as Goda Mandali. Her divine marriage to Vishnu is viewed by some as a feminist act, as it allowed her to avoid the regular duties of being a wife and gain autonomy. In the 12th century, the Waldensians Christian sect espoused some feministic ideas.

=== Renaissance Feminism ===
Italian-French writer Christine de Pizan (1364 – c. 1430), the author of &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot; and &quot;Epître au Dieu d&#x27;Amour&quot; (&quot;Epistle to the God of Love&quot;) is cited by Simone de Beauvoir as the first woman to denounce misogyny and write about the relation of the sexes. Christine de Pizan also wrote one of the early fictional accounts of gender transition in &quot;Le Livre de la mutation de fortune&quot;. Other early feminist writers include the 16th-century writers Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi, and Jane Anger, and the 17th-century writers Hannah Woolley in England, Juana Inés de la Cruz in Mexico, Marie Le Jars de Gournay, Anne Bradstreet, Anna Maria van Schurman and François Poullain de la Barre. The emergence of women as true intellectuals effected change also in Italian humanism. Cassandra Fedele was the first woman to join a humanist group and achieved much despite greater constraints on women.

Renaissance defenses of women are present in a variety of literary genre and across Europe with a central claim of equality. Feminists appealed to principles that progressively lead to discourse of economic property injustice themes. Feminizing society was a way for women at this time to use literature to create interdependent and non-hierarchical systems that provided opportunities for both women and men.

Men have also played an important role in the history of defending that women are capable and able to compete equally with men, including Antonio Cornazzano, Vespasiano de Bisticci, and Giovanni Sabadino degli Arienti. Castiglione continues this trend of defending woman&#x27;s moral character and that traditions are at fault for the appearance of women&#x27;s inferiority. However, the critique is that there is no advocacy for social change, leaving her out of the political sphere, and abandoning her to traditional domestic roles. Although, many of them would encourage that if women were to be included in the political sphere it would be a natural consequence of their education. In addition, some of these men state that men are at fault for the lack of knowledge of intellectual women by leaving them out of historical records.

One of the most important 17th-century feminist writers in the English language was Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Her knowledge was recognized by some, such as proto-feminist Bathsua Makin, who wrote that &quot;The present Dutchess of New-Castle, by her own Genius, rather than any timely Instruction, over-tops many grave Grown-Men,&quot; and considered her a prime example of what women could become through education.

=== 17th century ===
Margaret Fell&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Women&#x27;s Speaking Justified&quot;, a scripture-based argument for women&#x27;s ministry, and one of the major texts on women&#x27;s religious leadership in the 17th century. In this short pamphlet, Fell based her argument for equality of the sexes on one of the basic premises of Quakerism, namely spiritual equality. Her belief was that God created all human beings, therefore both men and women were capable of not only possessing the Inner Light but also the ability to be a prophet. Fell has been described as a &quot;feminist pioneer&quot;.

In 1622, Marie de Gournay published &quot;The Equality of Men and Women&quot;, in which she argued for equality of the sexes.

== 18th century: the Age of Enlightenment ==
The Age of Enlightenment was characterized by secular intellectual reasoning and a flowering of philosophical writing. Many Enlightenment philosophers defended the rights of women, including Jeremy Bentham (1781), Marquis de Condorcet (1790), and Mary Wollstonecraft (1792). Other important writers of the time that expressed feminist views included Abigail Adams, Catharine Macaulay, and Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht.

=== Jeremy Bentham ===
The English utilitarian and classical liberal philosopher Jeremy Bentham said that it was the placing of women in a legally inferior position that made him choose the career of a reformist at the age of eleven, though American critic John Neal claimed to have convinced him to take up women&#x27;s rights issues during their association between 1825 and 1827. Bentham spoke for complete equality between sexes including the rights to vote and to participate in government. He opposed the asymmetrical sexual moral standards between men and women.

In his &quot;Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot; (1781), Bentham strongly condemned many countries&#x27; common practice to deny women&#x27;s rights due to allegedly inferior minds. Bentham gave many examples of able female regents.

=== Marquis de Condorcet ===
Nicolas de Condorcet was a mathematician, classical liberal politician, leading French Revolutionary, republican, and Voltairean anti-clericalist. He was also a fierce defender of human rights, including the equality of women and the abolition of slavery, unusual for the 1780s. He advocated for women&#x27;s suffrage in the new government in 1790 with &quot;De l&#x27;admission des femmes au droit de cité&quot; (&quot;For the Admission to the Rights of Citizenship For Women&quot;) and an article for &quot;Journal de la Société de 1789&quot;.

=== Olympe de Gouges and a Declaration ===
Following de Condorcet&#x27;s repeated, yet failed, appeals to the National Assembly in 1789 and 1790, Olympe de Gouges (in association with the Society of the Friends of Truth) authored and published the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen in 1791. This was another plea for the French Revolutionary government to recognize the natural and political rights of women. De Gouges wrote the Declaration in the prose of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, almost mimicking the failure of men to include more than a half of the French population in &quot;egalité&quot;. Even though the Declaration did not immediately accomplish its goals, it did set a precedent for a manner in which feminists could satirize their governments for their failures in equality, seen in documents such as &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; and &quot;A Declaration of Sentiments&quot;.

=== Wollstonecraft and &quot;A Vindication&quot; ===
Perhaps the most cited feminist writer of the time was Mary Wollstonecraft, She identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective. Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the &quot;Two Wollstonecrafts&quot;) reflective of problems that had no easy answers, this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought.

Wollstonecraft believed that both genders contributed to inequality. She took women&#x27;s considerable power over men for granted, and determined that both would require education to ensure the necessary changes in social attitudes. Given her humble origins and scant education, her personal achievements speak to her own determination. For many commentators, Wollstonecraft represents the first codification of equality feminism, or a refusal of the feminine role in society.

== 19th century ==
=== The feminine ideal ===
19th-century feminists reacted to cultural inequities including the pernicious, widespread acceptance of the Victorian image of women&#x27;s &quot;proper&quot; role and &quot;sphere&quot;. The Victorian ideal created a dichotomy of &quot;separate spheres&quot; for men and women that was very clearly defined in theory, though not always in reality. In this ideology, men were to occupy the public sphere (the space of wage labor and politics) and women the private sphere (the space of home and children.) This &quot;feminine ideal&quot;, also called &quot;The Cult of Domesticity&quot;, was typified in Victorian conduct books such as &quot;Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management&quot; and Sarah Stickney Ellis&#x27;s books. &quot;The Angel in the House&quot; (1854) and &quot;El ángel del hogar&quot; (The angel in the house) (1857), bestsellers by Coventry Patmore and María del Pilar Sinués de Marco, came to symbolize the Victorian feminine ideal. Queen Victoria herself disparaged the concept of feminism, which she described in private letters as the &quot;mad, wicked folly of &#x27;Woman&#x27;s Rights&#x27;&quot;.

=== Feminism in fiction ===
As Jane Austen addressed women&#x27;s restricted lives in the early part of the century, Charlotte Brontë, Anne Brontë, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot depicted women&#x27;s misery and frustration. In her autobiographical novel &quot;Ruth Hall&quot; (1854), American journalist Fanny Fern describes her own struggle to support her children as a newspaper columnist after her husband&#x27;s untimely death. Louisa May Alcott penned a strongly feminist novel, &quot;A Long Fatal Love Chase&quot; (1866), about a young woman&#x27;s attempts to flee her bigamist husband and become independent.

Male authors also recognized injustices against women. The novels of George Meredith, George Gissing, and Thomas Hardy, and the plays of Henrik Ibsen outlined the contemporary plight of women. Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Diana of the Crossways&quot; (1885) is an account of Caroline Norton&#x27;s life. One critic later called Ibsen&#x27;s plays &quot;feministic propaganda&quot;.

=== John Neal ===

John Neal is remembered as America&#x27;s first women&#x27;s rights lecturer. Starting in 1823 and continuing at least as late as 1869, he used magazine articles, short stories, novels, public speaking, political organizing, and personal relationships to advance feminist issues in the United States and Great Britain, reaching the height of his influence in this field circa 1843. He declared intellectual equality between men and women, fought coverture, and demanded suffrage, equal pay, and better education and working conditions for women. Neal&#x27;s early feminist essays in the 1820s fill an intellectual gap between Mary Wollstonecraft, Catharine Macaulay, and Judith Sargent Murray and Seneca Falls Convention-era successors like Sarah Moore Grimké, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Margaret Fuller. As a male writer insulated from many common forms of attack against female feminist thinkers, Neal&#x27;s advocacy was crucial in bringing the field back into the mainstream in England and the US.

In his essays for &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (1824-1825), Neal called for women&#x27;s suffrage and &quot;maintain[ed] that women are not &quot;inferior&quot; to men, but only &quot;unlike&quot; men, in their intellectual properties&quot; and &quot;would have women treated like men, of common sense.&quot; In &quot;The Yankee&quot; magazine (1828–1829), he demanded economic opportunities for women, saying &quot;We hope to see the day... when our women of all ages... will be able to maintain herself, without being obliged to marry for bread.&quot; At his most well-attended lecture titled &quot;Rights of Women,&quot; Neal spoke before a crowd of around 3,000 people in 1843 at New York City&#x27;s largest auditorium at the time, the Broadway Tabernacle. Neal became even more prominently involved with the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in his old age following the Civil War, both in Maine and nationally in the US by supporting Elizabeth Cady Stanton&#x27;s and Susan B. Anthony&#x27;s National Woman Suffrage Association and writing for its journal, &quot;The Revolution&quot;. Stanton and Anthony recognized his work after his death in their &quot;History of Woman Suffrage.&quot;

=== Marion Reid and Caroline Norton ===
At the outset of the 19th century, the dissenting feminist voices had little to no social influence. There was little sign of change in the political or social order, nor any evidence of a recognizable women&#x27;s movement. Collective concerns began to coalesce by the end of the century, paralleling the emergence of a stiffer social model and code of conduct that Marion Reid described as confining and repressive for women. While the increased emphasis on feminine virtue partly stirred the call for a woman&#x27;s movement, the tensions that this role caused for women plagued many early-19th-century feminists with doubt and worry, and fueled opposing views.

In Scotland, Reid published her influential &quot;A Plea for Woman&quot; in 1843, which proposed a transatlantic Western agenda for women&#x27;s rights, including voting rights for women.

Caroline Norton advocated for changes in British law. She discovered a lack of legal rights for women upon entering an abusive marriage. The publicity generated from her appeal to Queen Victoria and related activism helped change English laws to recognize and accommodate married women and child custody issues.

=== Florence Nightingale and Frances Power Cobbe ===

While many women including Norton were wary of organized movements, their actions and words often motivated and inspired such movements. Among these was Florence Nightingale, whose conviction that women had all the potential of men but none of the opportunities impelled her storied nursing career. At the time, her feminine virtues were emphasized over her ingenuity, an example of the bias against acknowledging female accomplishment in the mid-1800s.

Due to varying ideologies, feminists were not always supportive of each other&#x27;s efforts. Harriet Martineau and others dismissed Wollstonecraft&#x27;s contributions as dangerous, and deplored Norton&#x27;s candidness, but seized on the abolitionist campaign that Martineau had witnessed in the United States as one that should logically be applied to women. Her &quot;Society in America&quot; was pivotal: it caught the imagination of women who urged her to take up their cause.
Anna Wheeler was influenced by Saint Simonian socialists while working in France. She advocated for suffrage and attracted the attention of Benjamin Disraeli, the Conservative leader, as a dangerous radical on a par with Jeremy Bentham. She would later inspire early socialist and feminist advocate William Thompson, who wrote the first work published in English to advocate full equality of rights for women, the 1825 &quot;Appeal of One Half of the Human Race&quot;.

Feminists of previous centuries charged women&#x27;s exclusion from education as the central cause for their domestic relegation and denial of social advancement, and women&#x27;s 19th-century education was no better. Frances Power Cobbe, among others, called for education reform, an issue that gained attention alongside marital and property rights, and domestic violence.

Female journalists like Martineau and Cobbe in Britain, and Margaret Fuller in America, were achieving journalistic employment, which placed them in a position to influence other women. Cobbe would refer to &quot;Woman&#x27;s Rights&quot; not just in the abstract, but as an identifiable cause.

=== Ladies of Langham Place ===

Barbara Leigh Smith and her friends met regularly during the 1850s in London&#x27;s Langham Place to discuss the united women&#x27;s voice necessary for achieving reform. These &quot;Ladies of Langham Place&quot; included Bessie Rayner Parkes and Anna Jameson. They focused on education, employment, and marital law. One of their causes became the Married Women&#x27;s Property Committee of 1855. They collected thousands of signatures for legislative reform petitions, some of which were successful. Smith had also attended the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention in America.

Smith and Parkes, together and apart, wrote many articles on education and employment opportunities. In the same year as Norton, Smith summarized the legal framework for injustice in her 1854 &quot;A Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women&quot;. She was able to reach large numbers of women via her role in the &quot;English Women&#x27;s Journal&quot;. The response to this journal led to their creation of the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women (SPEW). Smith&#x27;s Married Women&#x27;s Property committee collected 26,000 signatures to change the law for all women, including those unmarried.

Harriet Taylor published her &quot;Enfranchisement&quot; in 1851, and wrote about the inequities of family law. In 1853, she married John Stuart Mill, and provided him with much of the subject material for &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;.

Emily Davies also encountered the Langham group, and with Elizabeth Garrett created SPEW branches outside London.

=== Educational reform ===

The interrelated barriers to education and employment formed the backbone of 19th-century feminist reform efforts, for instance, as described by Harriet Martineau in her 1859 &quot;Edinburgh Journal&quot; article, &quot;Female Industry&quot;. These barriers did not change in conjunction with the economy. Martineau, however, remained a moderate, for practical reasons, and unlike Cobbe, did not support the emerging call for the vote.

The education reform efforts of women like Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. Queen&#x27;s College (1848) and Bedford College (1849) in London began to offer some education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations, and achieved partial success in 1865. She published &quot;The Higher Education of Women&quot; a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became Girton College, Cambridge in 1869, Newnham College, Cambridge in 1871, and Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few could take advantage of them and life for female students was still difficult.

In the 1883 Ilbert Bill controversy, a British India bill that proposed Indian judicial jurisdiction to try British criminals, Bengali women in support of the bill responded by claiming that they were more educated than the English women opposed to the bill, and noted that more Indian women had degrees than British women at the time.

As part of the continuing dialogue between British and American feminists, Elizabeth Blackwell, one of the first American women to graduate in medicine (1849), lectured in Britain with Langham support. She eventually took her degree in France. Garrett&#x27;s very successful 1870 campaign to run for London School Board office is another example of a how a small band of very determined women were beginning to reach positions of influence at the local government level.

=== Women&#x27;s campaigns ===
Campaigns gave women opportunities to test their new political skills and to conjoin disparate social reform groups. Their successes include the campaign for the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act (passed in 1882) and the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1864, 1866, and 1869, which united women&#x27;s groups and utilitarian liberals like John Stuart Mill.

Generally, women were outraged by the inherent inequity and misogyny of the legislation. For the first time, women in large numbers took up the rights of prostitutes. Prominent critics included Blackwell, Nightingale, Martineau, and Elizabeth Wolstenholme. Elizabeth Garrett, unlike her sister, Millicent, did not support the campaign, though she later admitted that the campaign had done well.

Josephine Butler, already experienced in prostitution issues, a charismatic leader, and a seasoned campaigner, emerged as the natural leader of what became the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts in 1869. Her work demonstrated the potential power of an organized lobby group. The association successfully argued that the Acts not only demeaned prostitutes, but all women and men by promoting a blatant sexual double standard. Butler&#x27;s activities resulted in the radicalization of many moderate women. The Acts were repealed in 1886.

On a smaller scale, Annie Besant campaigned for the rights of matchgirls (female factory workers) and against the appalling conditions under which they worked in London. Her work of publicizing the difficult conditions of the workers through interviews in bi-weekly periodicals like The Link became a method for raising public concern over social issues.

== 19th to 21st centuries ==

Feminists did not recognize separate waves of feminism until the second wave was so named by journalist Martha Weinman Lear in a 1968 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article &quot;The Second Feminist Wave&quot;, according to Alice Echols. Jennifer Baumgardner reports criticism by professor Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz of the division into waves and the difficulty of categorizing some feminists into specific waves, argues that the main critics of a wave are likely to be members of the prior wave who remain vital, and that waves are coming faster. The &quot;waves debate&quot; has influenced how historians and other scholars have established the chronologies of women&#x27;s political activism.

=== First wave ===
The 19th- and early 20th-century feminist activity in the English-speaking world that sought to win women&#x27;s suffrage, female education rights, better working conditions, and abolition of gender double standards is known as first-wave feminism. The term &quot;first-wave&quot; was coined retrospectively when the term &quot;second-wave feminism&quot; was used to describe a newer feminist movement that fought social and cultural inequalities beyond basic political inequalities.
In the United States, feminist movement leaders campaigned for the national abolition of slavery and Temperance before championing women&#x27;s rights. American first-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as Frances Willard and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union), others resembling the diversity and radicalism of much of second-wave feminism (such as Stanton, Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, and the National Woman Suffrage Association, of which Stanton was president). First-wave feminism in the United States is considered to have ended with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1920), which granted women the right to vote in the United States.

Activism for the equality of women was not limited to the United States. In mid-nineteenth century Persia, Táhirih, an early member of the Bábí Faith, was active as a poet and religious reformer. At a time when it was considered taboo for women to speak openly with men in Persia, and for non-clerics to speak about religion, she challenged the intellectuals of the age in public discourse on social and theological matters. In 1848 she appeared before an assemblage of men without a veil and gave a speech on the rights of women, signaling a radical break with the prevailing moral order and the start of a new religious and social dispensation. After this episode she was put under house arrest by the Persian Government until her execution by strangling at the age of 35 in August 1852. At her execution she is reported as proclaiming &quot;You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.&quot; The story of her life rapidly spread to European circles and she would inspire later generations of Iranian feminists. Members of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith recognize her as the first women&#x27;s suffrage martyr and an example of fearlessness and courage in the advancement of the equality of women and men.

Louise Dittmar campaigned for women&#x27;s rights, in Germany, in the 1840s. Although slightly later in time, Fusae Ichikawa was in the first wave of women&#x27;s activists in her own country of Japan, campaigning for women&#x27;s suffrage. Mary Lee was active in the suffrage movement in South Australia, the first Australian colony to grant women the vote in 1894. In New Zealand, Kate Sheppard and Mary Ann Müller worked to achieve the vote for women by 1893.
In the United States, the antislavery campaign of the 1830s served as both a cause ideologically compatible with feminism and a blueprint for later feminist political organizing. Attempts to exclude women only strengthened their convictions. Sarah and Angelina Grimké moved rapidly from the emancipation of slaves to the emancipation of women. The most influential feminist writer of the time was the colourful journalist Margaret Fuller, whose &quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; was published in 1845. Her dispatches from Europe for the &quot;New York Tribune&quot; helped create to synchronize the women&#x27;s rights movement.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott met in 1840 while en route to London where they were shunned as women by the male leadership of the first World&#x27;s Anti-Slavery Convention. In 1848, Mott and Stanton held a woman&#x27;s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New York, where a declaration of independence for women was drafted. Lucy Stone helped to organize the first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in 1850, a much larger event at which Sojourner Truth, Abby Kelley Foster, and others spoke sparked Susan B. Anthony to take up the cause of women&#x27;s rights. In December 1851, Sojourner Truth contributed to the feminist movement when she spoke at the Women&#x27;s Convention in Akron, Ohio. She delivered her powerful &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman&quot; speech in an effort to promote women&#x27;s rights by demonstrating their ability to accomplish tasks that have been traditionally associated with men. Barbara Leigh Smith met with Mott in 1858, strengthening the link between the transatlantic feminist movements.

Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage saw the Church as a major obstacle to women&#x27;s rights, and welcomed the emerging literature on matriarchy. Both Gage and Stanton produced works on this topic, and collaborated on &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;. Stanton wrote &quot;The Matriarchate or Mother-Age&quot; and Gage wrote &quot;Woman, Church and State&quot;, neatly inverting Johann Jakob Bachofen&#x27;s thesis and adding a unique epistemological perspective, the critique of objectivity and the perception of the subjective.

Stanton once observed regarding assumptions of female inferiority, &quot;The worst feature of these assumptions is that women themselves believe them&quot;. However this attempt to replace androcentric (male-centered) theological tradition with a gynocentric (female-centered) view made little headway in a women&#x27;s movement dominated by religious elements; thus she and Gage were largely ignored by subsequent generations.

By 1913, Feminism (originally capitalized) was a household term in the United States. Major issues in the 1910s and 1920s included suffrage, women&#x27;s partisan activism, economics and employment, sexualities and families, war and peace, and a Constitutional amendment for equality. Both equality and difference were seen as routes to women&#x27;s empowerment. Organizations at the time included the National Woman&#x27;s Party, suffrage advocacy groups such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the National League of Women Voters, career associations such as the American Association of University Women, the National Federation of Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Clubs, and the National Women&#x27;s Trade Union League, war and peace groups such as the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom and the International Council of Women, alcohol-focused groups like the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and the Women&#x27;s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, and race- and gender-centered organizations like the National Association of Colored Women. Leaders and theoreticians included Jane Addams, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Alice Paul, Carrie Chapman Catt, Margaret Sanger, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman.

=== Suffrage ===

The women&#x27;s right to vote, with its legislative representation, represented a paradigm shift where women would no longer be treated as second-class citizens without a voice. The women&#x27;s suffrage campaign is the most deeply embedded campaign of the past 250 years.

At first, suffrage was treated as a lower priority. The French Revolution accelerated this, with the assertions of Condorcet and de Gouges, and the women who led the 1789 march on Versailles. In 1793, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women was founded, and originally included suffrage on its agenda before it was suppressed at the end of the year. As a gesture, this showed that issue was now part of the European political agenda.

German women were involved in the Vormärz, a prelude to the 1848 revolution. In Italy, Clara Maffei, Cristina Trivulzio Belgiojoso, and Ester Martini Currica were politically active in the events leading up to 1848. In Britain, interest in suffrage emerged from the writings of Wheeler and Thompson in the 1820s, and from Reid, Taylor, and Anne Knight in the 1840s. While New Zealand was the first sovereign state where women won the right to vote (1893), they did not win the right to stand in elections until later. The Australian State of South Australia was the first sovereign state in the world to officially grant full suffrage to women (in 1894).

==== The suffragettes ====
The Langham Place ladies set up a suffrage committee at an 1866 meeting at Elizabeth Garrett&#x27;s home, renamed the London Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage in 1867. Soon similar committees had spread across the country, raising petitions, and working closely with John Stuart Mill. When denied outlets by establishment periodicals, feminists started their own, such as Lydia Becker&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Suffrage Journal&quot; in 1870.

Other publications included Richard Pankhurst&#x27;s &quot;Englishwoman&#x27;s Review&quot; (1866). Tactical disputes were the biggest problem, and the groups&#x27; memberships fluctuated. Women considered whether men (like Mill) should be involved. As it went, Mill withdrew as the movement became more aggressive with each disappointment. The political pressure ensured debate, but year after year the movement was defeated in Parliament.

Despite this, the women accrued political experience, which translated into slow progress at the local government level. But after years of frustration, many women became increasingly radicalized. Some refused to pay taxes, and the Pankhurst family emerged as the dominant movement influence, having also founded the Women&#x27;s Franchise League in 1889, which sought local election suffrage for women.

==== International suffrage ====

The Isle of Man, a UK dependency, was the first free standing jurisdiction to grant women the vote (1881), followed by the right to vote (but not to stand) in New Zealand in 1893, where Kate Sheppard had pioneered reform. Some Australian states had also granted women the vote. This included Victoria for a brief period (1863–5), South Australia (1894), and Western Australia (1899). Australian women received the vote at the Federal level in 1902, Finland in 1906, and Norway initially in 1907 (completed in 1913).

=== Early 20th century ===

In the early part of the 20th century, also known as the Edwardian era, there was a change in the way women dressed from the Victorian rigidity and complacency. Women, especially women who married a wealthy man, would often wear what we consider today, practical.

Books, articles, speeches, pictures, and papers from the period show a diverse range of themes other than political reform and suffrage discussed publicly. In the Netherlands, for instance, the main feminist issues were educational rights, rights to medical care, improved working conditions, peace, and dismantled gender double standards. Feminists identified as such with little fanfare.

Emmeline Pankhurst formed the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903. As she put it, they viewed votes for women no longer as &quot;a right, but as a desperate necessity&quot;. At the state level, Australia and the United States had already granted suffrage to some women. American feminists such as Susan B. Anthony (1902) visited Britain. While WSPU was the best-known suffrage group, it was only one of many, such as the Women&#x27;s Freedom League and the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) led by Millicent Garrett Fawcett. WSPU was largely a family affair, although externally financed. Christabel Pankhurst became the dominant figure and gathered friends such as Annie Kenney, Flora Drummond, Teresa Billington, Ethel Smyth, Grace Roe, and Norah Dacre Fox (later known as Norah Elam) around her. Veterans such as Elizabeth Garrett also joined.

In 1906, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; first labeled these women &quot;suffragettes&quot; as a form of ridicule, but the term was embraced by the women to describe the more militant form of suffragism visible in public marches, distinctive green, purple, and white emblems, and the Artists&#x27; Suffrage League&#x27;s dramatic graphics. The feminists learned to exploit photography and the media, and left a vivid visual record including images such as the 1914 photograph of Emmeline.


The protests slowly became more violent, and included heckling, banging on doors, smashing shop windows, and arson. Emily Davison, a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 Epsom Derby and died under the King&#x27;s horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation. As many protesters were imprisoned and went on hunger-strike, the British government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.
==== Feminist science fiction ====

At the beginning of the 20th century, feminist science fiction emerged as a subgenre of science fiction that deals with women&#x27;s roles in society. Female writers of the utopian literature movement at the time of first-wave feminism often addressed sexism. Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s &quot;Herland&quot; (1915) did so. &quot;Sultana&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1905) by Bengali Muslim feminist Roquia Sakhawat Hussain depicts a gender-reversed purdah in a futuristic world.

During the 1920s, writers such as Clare Winger Harris and Gertrude Barrows Bennett published science fiction stories written from female perspectives and occasionally dealt with gender- and sexuality-based topics while popular 1920s and 30s pulp science fiction exaggerated masculinity alongside sexist portrayals of women. By the 1960s, science fiction combined sensationalism with political and technological critiques of society. With the advent of feminism, women&#x27;s roles were questioned in this &quot;subversive, mind expanding genre&quot;.

Feminist science fiction poses questions about social issues such as how society constructs gender roles, how reproduction defines gender, and how the political power of men and women are unequal. Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore societies where gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, and dystopias to explore worlds where gender inequalities are escalated, asserting a need for feminist work to continue.

==== During the first and second world wars ====

Women entered the labor market during the First World War in unprecedented numbers, often in new sectors, and discovered the value of their work. The war also left large numbers of women bereaved and with a net loss of household income. The scores of men killed and wounded shifted the demographic composition. War also split the feminist groups, with many women opposed to the war and others involved in the white feather campaign.

Feminist scholars like Françoise Thébaud and Nancy F. Cott note a conservative reaction to World War I in some countries, citing a reinforcement of traditional imagery and literature that promotes motherhood. The appearance of these traits in wartime has been called the &quot;nationalization of women.&quot;

In the years between the wars, feminists fought discrimination and establishment opposition to advances in women&#x27;s roles in the social world and workforce. In Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;, Woolf describes the extent of the backlash and her frustration. By now, the word &quot;feminism&quot; was in use, but with a negative connotation from mass media, which discouraged women from self-identifying as such. When Rebecca West, another prominent writer, had been attacked as &quot;a feminist&quot;, Woolf defended her. West has been remembered for her comment &quot;I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat, or a prostitute.&quot;

In the 1920s, the nontraditional styles and attitudes of flappers were popular among American and British women.

==== Electoral reform ====
The United Kingdom&#x27;s Representation of the People Act 1918 gave near-universal suffrage to men, and suffrage to women over 30. The Representation of the People Act 1928 extended equal suffrage to both men and women. It also shifted the socioeconomic makeup of the electorate towards the working class, favouring the Labour Party, who were more sympathetic to women&#x27;s issues.

The granting of the vote did not automatically give women the right to stand for Parliament and the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act was rushed through just before the following election. Seventeen women were among the 1700 candidates nominated. Christabel Pankhurst narrowly failed to win a seat, and Constance Markievicz (Sinn Féin) was the first woman elected in Ireland in 1918, but as an Irish nationalist, refused to take her seat.

In 1919 and 1920, both Lady Astor and Margaret Wintringham won seats for the Conservatives and Liberals respectively by succeeding their husband&#x27;s seats. Labour swept to power in 1924. Astor&#x27;s proposal to form a women&#x27;s party in 1929 was unsuccessful. Women gained considerable electoral experience over the next few years as a series of minority governments ensured almost annual elections. Close affiliation with Labour also proved to be a problem for the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which had little support in the Conservative party. However, their persistence with Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin was rewarded with the passage of the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928.

European women received the vote in Finland (that time still an autonomous state under Czar Russia) in 1906, in Denmark and Iceland in 1915 (full in 1919), the Russian Republic in 1917, Austria, Germany and Canada in 1918, many countries including the Netherlands in 1919, Czechoslovakia (today Czech Republic and Slovakia) in 1920, and Turkey and South Africa in 1930. French women did not receive the vote until 1945. Liechtenstein was one of the last countries, in 1984.

After French women were given the right to vote in 1945, two women&#x27;s organizations were founded in the French colony of Martinique. &quot;Le Rassemblement féminin&quot; and &quot;l&#x27;Union des femmes de la Martinique&quot; both had the goal of encouraging women to vote in the upcoming elections. While &quot;l&#x27;Union des femmes de la Martinique,&quot; founded by Jeanne Lero was influenced by beliefs, &quot;Le Rassemblement féminin,&quot; founded by Paulette Nardal, claimed to not support any particular political party and only encouraged women to take political action in order to create social change.

==== Social reform ====
The political change did not immediately change social circumstances. With the economic recession, women were the most vulnerable sector of the workforce. Some women who held jobs prior to the war were obliged to forfeit them to returning soldiers, and others were excessed. With limited franchise, the UK National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) pivoted into a new organization, the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship (NUSEC), which still advocated for equality in franchise, but extended its scope to examine equality in social and economic areas. Legislative reform was sought for discriminatory laws (e.g., family law and prostitution) and over the differences between &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;equity&quot;, the accommodations that would allow women to overcome barriers to fulfillment (known in later years as the &quot;equality vs. difference conundrum&quot;). Eleanor Rathbone, who became a British Member of Parliament in 1929, succeeded Millicent Garrett as president of NUSEC in 1919. She expressed the critical need for consideration of &quot;difference&quot; in gender relationships as &quot;what women need to fulfill the potentialities of their own natures&quot;. The 1924 Labour government&#x27;s social reforms created a formal split, as a splinter group of strict egalitarians formed the Open Door Council in May 1926. This eventually became an international movement, and continued until 1965. Other important social legislation of this period included the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 (which opened professions to women), and the Matrimonial Causes Act 1923. In 1932, NUSEC separated advocacy from education, and continued the former activities as the National Council for Equal Citizenship and the latter as the Townswomen&#x27;s Guild. The council continued until the end of the Second World War.

==== Reproductive rights ====
British laws prevented feminists from discussing and addressing reproductive rights. Annie Besant was tried under the Obscene Publications Act 1857 in 1877 for publishing Charles Knowlton&#x27;s &quot;Fruits of Philosophy&quot;, a work on family planning. Knowlton had previously been convicted in the United States. She and her colleague Charles Bradlaugh were convicted but acquitted on appeal. The subsequent publicity resulted in a decline in the UK&#x27;s birth rate. Besant later wrote &quot;The Law of Population&quot;.

In America, Margaret Sanger was prosecuted for her book &quot;Family Limitation&quot; under the Comstock Act in 1914, and fled to Britain until it was safe to return. Sanger&#x27;s work was prosecuted in Britain. She met Marie Stopes in Britain, who was never prosecuted but regularly denounced for her promotion of birth control. In 1917, Sanger started the &quot;Birth Control Review&quot;. In 1926, Sanger gave a lecture on birth control to the women&#x27;s auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan in Silver Lake, New Jersey, which she referred to as a &quot;weird experience&quot;. The establishment of the Abortion Law Reform Association in 1936 was even more controversial. The British penalty for abortion had been reduced from execution to life imprisonment by the Offences against the Person Act 1861, although some exceptions were allowed in the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929. Following Aleck Bourne&#x27;s prosecution in 1938, the 1939 Birkett Committee made recommendations for reform that were set aside at the Second World War&#x27;s outbreak, along with many other women&#x27;s issues.

In the Netherlands, Aletta H. Jacobs, the first Dutch female doctor, and Wilhelmina Drucker led discussion and action for reproductive rights. Jacobs imported diaphragms from Germany and distributed them to poor women for free.

=== 1940s ===
In most front line countries, women volunteered or were conscripted for various duties in support of the national war effort. In Britain, women were drafted and assigned to industrial jobs or to non-combat military service. The British services enrolled 460,000 women. The largest service, Auxiliary Territorial Service, had a maximum of 213,000 women enrolled, many of whom served in anti-aircraft gun combat roles. In many countries, including Germany and the Soviet Union, women volunteered or were conscripted. In Germany, women volunteered in the League of German Girls and assisted the Luftwaffe as anti-aircraft gunners, or as guerrilla fighters in Werwolf units behind Allied lines. In the Soviet Union, about 820,000 women served in the military as medics, radio operators, truck drivers, snipers, combat pilots, and junior commanding officers.

Many American women retained their domestic chores and often added a paid job, especially one related to a war industry. Much more so than in the previous war, large numbers of women were hired for unskilled or semi-skilled jobs in munitions, and barriers against married women taking jobs were eased. The popular Rosie the Riveter icon became a symbol for a generation of American working women. In addition, some 300,000 women served in U.S. military uniform with organizations such as Women&#x27;s Army Corps and WAVES. With many young men gone, sports organizers tried to set up professional women&#x27;s teams, such as the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which closed after the war. After the war, most munitions plants closed, and civilian plants replaced their temporary female workers with returning veterans, who had priority.

=== Second wave ===


&quot;Second-wave feminism&quot; identifies a period of feminist activity from the early 1960s through the late 1980s that saw cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked. The movement encouraged women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and reflective of a sexist power structure. As first-wave feminists focused on absolute rights such as suffrage, second-wave feminists focused on other cultural equality issues, such as ending discrimination.

==== Betty Friedan, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, and Women&#x27;s Liberation ====
A landmark feminist work appeared in 1949 called &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, a book written by Simone de Beauvoir. The critical text pertained to every facet of what would later be defined as gender discourse. Beauvoir goes into detail on the treatment of women throughout entire history of the world and analyses the modes of oppression enforced by patriarchy and then critiques it. In 1963, Betty Friedan&#x27;s exposé &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; became the voice for the discontent and disorientation women felt in being shunted into homemaking positions after their college graduations. In the book, Friedan explored the roots of the change in women&#x27;s roles from essential workforce during World War II to homebound housewife and mother after the war, and assessed the forces that drove this change in perception of women&#x27;s roles.

The expression &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation&quot; has been used to refer to feminism throughout history. &quot;Liberation&quot; has been associated with feminist aspirations since 1895, and appears in the context of &quot;women&#x27;s liberation&quot; in Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s 1949 &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, which appeared in English translation in 1953. The phrase &quot;women&#x27;s liberation&quot; was first used in 1964, in print in 1966, though the French equivalent, &quot;libération des femmes&quot;, occurred as far back as 1911. &quot;Women&#x27;s liberation&quot; was in use at the 1967 American Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) convention, which held a panel discussion on the topic. In 1968, the term &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation Front&quot; appeared in &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine, and began to refer to the whole women&#x27;s movement. In Chicago, women disillusioned with the New Left met separately in 1967, and published &quot;Voice of the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot; in March 1968. When the Miss America pageant took place in Atlantic City in September 1968, the media referred to the resulting demonstrations as &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation&quot;. The Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union was formed in 1969. Similar groups with similar titles appeared in many parts of the United States. Bra-burning, although fictional, became associated with the movement, and the media coined other terms such as &quot;libber&quot;. &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation&quot; persisted over the other rival terms for the new feminism, captured the popular imagination, and has endured alongside the older term &quot;Women&#x27;s Movement&quot;.

This time was marked by increased female enrolment in higher education, the establishment of academic women&#x27;s studies courses and departments, and feminist ideology in other related fields, such as politics, sociology, history, and literature. This academic shift in interests questioned the status quo, and its standards and authority.

The rise of the Women&#x27;s Liberation movement revealed &quot;multiple feminisms&quot;, or different underlying feminist lenses, due to the diverse origins from which groups had coalesced and intersected, and the complexity and contentiousness of the issues involved. bell hooks is noted as a prominent critic of the movement for its lack of voice given to the most oppressed women, its lack of emphasis on the inequalities of race and class, and its distance from the issues that divide women. Helen Reddy&#x27;s &quot;I Am Woman&quot;, John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Woman is the Nigger of the World&quot; and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Josei Joui Banzai&quot; were 70s feminist songs. Feminist&#x27;s wrong protest against rock music movement was started in Los Angeles, where Women Against Violence Against Women was founded in 1976; they campaigned against the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1976 album &quot;Black and Blue&quot;.

=== Feminist writing ===
The publication of Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; has been credited with beginning the so-called &quot;second wave&quot; of feminist activism, during which time feminist writers furthered conversations about women&#x27;s political and sexual concerns. Examples include Gloria Steinem&#x27;s &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine and Kate Millett&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Politics&quot;. Millett&#x27;s bleak survey of male writers, their attitudes and biases, to demonstrate that sex is politics, and politics is power imbalance in relationships. Shulamith Firestone&#x27;s &quot;The Dialectic of Sex&quot; described a feminist revolution based in Marxism, referenced as the &quot;sex war.&quot; Considering the debates over patriarchy, she claimed that male domination dated to &quot;back beyond recorded history to the animal kingdom itself.&quot;

Germaine Greer&#x27;s &quot;The Female Eunuch&quot;, Sheila Rowbotham&#x27;s &quot;Women&#x27;s Liberation and the New Politics&quot;, and Juliet Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Estate&quot; represent the English perspective. Mitchell argued that the movement should be seen as an international phenomenon with different manifestations based on local culture. British women drew on left-wing politics and organized small local discussion groups, partly through the London Women&#x27;s Liberation Workshop and its publications, &quot;Shrew&quot; and the LWLW Newsletter. Although there were marches, the focus was on consciousness-raising, or political activism intended to bring a cause or condition to a wider audience. Kathie Sarachild of Redstockings described its function as such that women would &quot;find what they thought was an individual dilemma is social predicament&quot;.

US women&#x27;s writing included works such as Susan Brownmiller&#x27;s 1975 &quot;Against Our Will,&quot; which introduced an explicit agenda against male violence, specifically male sexual violence, in a treatise on rape. Her work has been referred to as &quot;groundbreaking&quot; due to its framing of rape as a social problem; it also had a fair number of critics, primarily from feminists of color, who took issue with Brownmiller&#x27;s approach to race. Brownmiller&#x27;s other major book, &quot;In Our Time&quot; (2000), is a history of women&#x27;s liberation.

In Academic circles, feminist theology was a growing interest. Phyllis Trible wrote extensively throughout the 1970s to critique biblical interpretation of the time, using a type of critique known as Rhetorical criticism. Trible&#x27;s analysis of biblical text seeks to explain that the bible itself is not sexist, but that it is centuries of sexism in societies that have produced this narrative.

=== Feminist views on pornography ===
Susan Griffin was one of the first feminists to write on pornography&#x27;s implications in her 1981 &quot;Pornography and Silence&quot;. Beyond Brownmiller and Griffin&#x27;s positions, Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin influenced debates and activism around pornography and prostitution, particularly at the Supreme Court of Canada. MacKinnon, a lawyer, has stated, &quot;To be about to be raped is to be gender female in the process of going about life as usual.&quot; She explained sexual harassment by saying that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t mean that they [harassers] all want to fuck us, they just want to hurt us, dominate us, and control us, and that is fucking us.&quot; According to Pauline B. Bart, some people see radical feminism as the only movement that truly expresses the pain of being a woman in an unequal society, as it portrays that reality with the experiences of the battered and violated, which they claim to be the norm. Critics, including some feminists, civil libertarians, and jurists, have found this position uncomfortable and alienating.

This approach has evolved to transform the research and perspective on rape from an individual experience into a social problem.

=== Third wave ===
Third-wave feminism began in the early 1990s in response to what young women perceived as failures of the second-wave. It also responds to the backlash against the second-wave&#x27;s initiatives and movements. Third-wave feminism seeks to challenge or avoid second-wave &quot;essentialist&quot; definitions of femininity, which over-emphasized the experiences of white, upper-middle-class women. A post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality, or an understanding of gender as outside binary maleness and femaleness, is central to much of the third wave&#x27;s ideology. Third-wave feminists often describe &quot;micropolitics&quot;, and challenge second-wave paradigms about whether actions are unilaterally good for females.

These aspects of third-wave feminism arose in the mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Luisa Accati, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related subjectivities. This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 Hill–Thomas hearings, but began to shift with the Freedom Ride 1992, a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.

==== Sexual politics ====
Lesbianism during the second wave was visible within and without feminism. Lesbians felt sidelined by both gay liberation and women&#x27;s liberation, where they were referred to by Betty Friedan as a &quot;lavender menace&quot;, provoking &quot;The Woman-Identified Woman,&quot; a 1970 manifesto from the Radicalesbians that put lesbian women at the forefront of the liberation movement.

A few years later, Jill Johnston&#x27;s 1973 &quot;Lesbian Nation: The Feminist Solution&quot; argued for lesbian separatism, a practice by which lesbian women would separate themselves from the rest of society.

In reproductive rights, feminists sought the right to contraceptives (i.e., birth control), some of which were widely restricted in the US until the late 1960s and through the 1970s; the birth control pill, for example, was primarily available only to married women until the mid 1970s, though other women did find ways to get the pill anyhow. Access to abortion was also widely demanded so as to increase women&#x27;s economic independence and bodily autonomy, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.

Shulamith Firestone, active during the second wave of feminism, argued reproductive technology is connected to reproductive rights. Firestone believed in the enhancement of technologically concerning reproduction, in order to eliminate the obligation for women to reproduce and end oppression and inequality against them. Enhancing technology to empower women and abolish the gender hierarchy are the main focuses of a newer developing philosophy in feminism, known as cyberfeminism. Cyberfeminism has strong ties to reproductive rights and technology.

Third-wave feminists also fought to hasten social acceptance of female sexual freedom. As societal norms allowed men to have multiple sexual partners without rebuke, feminists sought sexual equality for that freedom and encouraged &quot;sexual liberation&quot; for women, including sex for pleasure with multiple partners, if desired. 

==== Global feminism ====

===== UN conferences on women =====

In 1946, the United Nations established a Commission on the Status of Women, which later joined the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In 1948, the UN issued its Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which protects &quot;the equal rights of men and women&quot;, and addressed both equality and equity. Starting with the 1975 World Conference of the International Women&#x27;s Year in Mexico City as part of their Decade for Women (1975–1985), the UN has held a series of world conferences on women&#x27;s issues. These conferences have worldwide female representation and provide considerable opportunity to advance women&#x27;s rights. They also illustrate deep cultural divisions and disagreement on universal principles, as evidenced by the successive Copenhagen (1980) and Nairobi (1985) conferences. Examples of such intrafeminism divisions have included disparities between economic development, attitudes towards forms of oppression, the definition of feminism, and stances on homosexuality, female circumcision, and population control. The Nairobi convention revealed a less monolithic feminism that &quot;constitutes the political expression of the concerns and interests of women from different regions, classes, nationalities, and ethnic backgrounds. There is and must be a diversity of feminisms, responsive to the different needs and concerns of women, and defined by them for themselves. This diversity builds on a common opposition to gender oppression and hierarchy which, however, is only the first step in articulating and acting upon a political agenda.&quot; The fourth conference was held in Beijing in 1995, where the Beijing Platform for Action was signed. This included a commitment to achieve &quot;gender equality and the empowerment of women&quot; through &quot;gender mainstreaming&quot;, or letting women and men &quot;experience equal conditions for realising their full human rights, and have the opportunity to contribute and benefit from national, political, economic, social and cultural development&quot;.

===== Bridging East and West =====

&quot;The definitional moment of third-wave feminism has been theorized as proceeding from critiques of the white women&#x27;s movement that were initiated by women of color, as well as from the many instances of coalition work undertaken by U.S. third world feminists&quot; Third world feminists since the 1980s have been critics of class-bias, racism, and Eurocentrism among women and feminists, and theories of multiplicity and difference given by these feminists such as Sandoval, Minh-ha, and Mohanty have enabled young feminists to dismantle the idea of monolithic feminism. They have empowered them to recognize the differences and declare multiple identities of being female, despite constantly feeling caught between modernity and tradition. Even though Asian women found it difficult to relate completely with the western women&#x27;s white problems, they related much with the women of color, and thus remolded it and built a bridge between both halves of feminism, the eastern and western, via interconnectedness among women around the world. They adapted and borrowed the &#x27;western&#x27; ideas of feminism and women in the west incorporated the effects of women&#x27;s movements in other parts of the world, while reinventing itself. Asian feminists acknowledged the need of recognizing multiple sources of domination in women&#x27;s lives all across the world, refused to universalize women&#x27;s experience as one, and instead recognized the differences among them due to different social locations. They claimed that although academic feminism introduced them to the idea of feminism, it failed to bring them closer to the sisters and mothers in their lives, and rather took them further away. Some have also argued that many goals of western feminism are not enough to assess women&#x27;s progress in Asia because they are not necessarily relevant or exportable across the boundaries. Thus, they redefined it as one that drew upon their heritage, history, and experiences. As Grewal puts it, &quot;These transnational feminist scholars enable us to rethink the way we construct and write the history of feminists in national and transnational contexts. Seeking to articulate transnational connections among women, they have suggested ways to move beyond constructed oppositions without ignoring the histories that informed these conflicts or the valid concerns about power relations that have represented or structured the conflicts up to this point.&quot;

=== Fourth wave ===
Fourth-wave feminism is a recent development within the feminist movement. Jennifer Baumgardner identifies fourth-wave feminism as starting in 2008 and continuing into the present day. Kira Cochrane, author of &quot; All the Rebel Women: The Rise of the Fourth Wave of Feminism&quot;, defines fourth-wave feminism as a movement that is connected through technology. Researcher Diana Diamond defines fourth-wave feminism as a movement that &quot;combines politics, psychology, and spirituality in an overarching vision of change.&quot;

==== Arguments for a new wave ====
In 2005, Pythia Peay first argued for the existence of a fourth wave of feminism, combining justice with religious spirituality. According to Jennifer Baumgardner in 2011, a fourth wave, incorporating online resources such as social media, may have begun in 2008, inspired partly by Take Our Daughters to Work Days. This fourth wave in turn has inspired or been associated with: the Doula Project for children&#x27;s services; post-abortion talk lines; pursuit of reproductive justice; plus-size fashion support; support for transgender rights; male feminism; sex work acceptance; and developing media including Feministing, Racialicious, blogs, and Twitter campaigns.

According to Kira Cochrane, a fourth wave had appeared in the U.K. and several other nations by 2012–13. It focused on: sexual inequality as manifested in &quot;street harassment, sexual harassment, workplace discrimination[,] ... body-shaming&quot;; media images, &quot;online misogyny&quot;, &quot;assault[s] on public transport&quot;; on intersectionality; on social media technology for communication and online petitioning for organizing; and on the perception, inherited from prior waves, that individual experiences are shared and thus can have political solutions. Cochrane identified as fourth wave such organizations and websites as the Everyday Sexism Project and UK Feminista; and events such as Reclaim the Night, One Billion Rising, and &quot;a Lose the Lads&#x27; mags protest&quot;, where &quot;many of [the leaders] ... are in their teens and 20s&quot;.

In 2014, Betty Dodson, who is also acknowledged as one of the leaders of the early 1980s pro-sex feminist movement, expressed that she considers herself a fourth wave feminist. Dodson expressed that the previous waves of feminist were banal and anti-sexual, which is why she has chosen to look at a new stance of feminism, fourth wave feminism. In 2014, Dodson worked with women to discover their sexual desires through masturbation. Dodson says her work has gained a fresh lease of life with a new audience of young, successful women who have never had an orgasm. This includes fourth-wave feminists - those rejecting the anti-pleasure stance they believe third-wave feminists stand for.

In 2014, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett and Holly Baxter released their book, &quot;The Vagenda.&quot; The authors of the book both consider themselves fourth wave feminists. Like their website &quot;The Vagenda&quot;, their book aims to flag and debunk the stereotypes of femininity promoted by the mainstream women&#x27;s press. One reviewer of the book has expressed disappointment with &quot;The Vagenda&quot;, saying that instead of being the &quot;call to arms for young women&quot; that it purports to be, it reads like a joyless dissertation detailing &quot;everything bad the media has ever done to women.&quot;

==== The Everyday Sexism Project ====
The Everyday Sexism Project began as a social media campaign on 16 April 2012 by Laura Bates, a British feminist writer. The aim of the site was to document everyday examples of sexism as reported by contributors around the world. Bates established the Everyday Sexism Project as an open forum where women could post their experiences of harassment. Bates explains the Everyday Sexism Project&#x27;s goal, &quot;&quot;The project was never about solving sexism. It was about getting people to take the first step of just realising there is a problem that needs to be fixed.&quot;

The website was such a success that Bates decided to write and publish a book, &quot;Everyday Sexism&quot;, which further emphasizes the importance of having this type of online forum for women. The book provides unique insight into the vibrant movement of the upcoming fourth wave and the untold stories that women shared through the Everyday Sexism Project.

==== Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution ====
In November 2015, a group of historians working with Clio Visualizing History launched &quot;Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution.&quot; This digital history exhibit examines the history of American feminism from the era of World War Two to the present. The exhibit has three major sections: Politics and Social Movements; Body and Health; and Workplace and Family.

=== Criticisms of the wave metaphor ===
In the 1960s, feminists described their movements as the &quot;second wave&quot; of feminism. As the second wave emerges, the importance of this new wave was to revisit that the current women&#x27;s right had a venerable past. This wave focused on the idea that these movements were a long tradition of activism and during the second wave, feminists began to rewrite U.S. history through recognizing that the suffrage movement was part of the nineteenth century movement around women&#x27;s issues. Presently, many contributions about the Second Wave Feminism was correlated with &quot;hegemonic feminism&quot;. This feminism views sexism as the main oppression and it was mainly led by white individuals who &quot;marginalized the activism and world views of women of color&quot;. Women of color and white antiracist women clarify the rise of multiracial feminism through telling the history of the Second Wave feminism. One of the earlier feminist organizations of the Second Wave was a Chicana group named Hijas de Cuauntemoc (1971) which was named after an underground newspaper written by women during the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Multiple other feminist organizations that were created in the early 1970s with Black, Asian, Latina, and Native American women have created a nationalist tradition of sending out a message that there is a need for people of color-led, independent organizations.

During the 1990s, the United States feminist activity that was present in the 1960s through the 1980s was no longer expressed. The wave metaphor for the Second Wave showed the 1960s movement as anything other than a historical situation, and showed that the nineteenth century movement was a bigger deal and had more impact on history than what was taught. As many pondered on what state was feminism presently in, one idea emerged in the early 1990s as the &quot;third wave&quot;. As emerging from the Second Wave and onto the Third Wave, the wave metaphor has reached its usefulness. Individuals are more aware of the significance the nineteenth century had on women&#x27;s movement and are more aware of the emergence the 1960s had from their long struggle regarding women&#x27;s issues.

== National histories of feminism ==

=== France ===

The 18th century French Revolution&#x27;s focus on &quot;égalité&quot; (equality) extended to the inequities faced by French women. The writer Olympe de Gouges amended the 1791 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen into the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, where she argued that women accountable to the law must also bear equal responsibility under the law. She also addressed marriage as a social contract between equals and attacked women&#x27;s reliance on beauty and charm as a form of slavery. Two years later, she was executed by guillotine.

The 19th century, conservative, post-Revolution France was inhospitable for feminist ideas, as expressed in the counter-revolutionary writings on the role of women by Joseph de Maistre and Viscount Louis de Bonald. Advancement came mid-century under the 1848 revolution and the proclamation of the Second Republic, which introduced male suffrage amid hopes that similar benefits would apply to women. Although the Utopian Charles Fourier is considered a feminist writer of this period, his influence was minimal at the time. With the fall of the conservative Louis-Philippe in 1848, feminist hopes were raised, as in 1790. Movement newspapers and organizations appeared, such as Eugénie Niboyet&#x27;s &quot;La Voix des Femmes&quot; (&quot;The Women&#x27;s Voice&quot;), the first feminist daily newspaper in France. Niboyet was a Protestant who had adopted Saint-Simonianism, and &quot;La Voix&quot; attracted other women from that movement, including the seamstress Jeanne Deroin and the primary schoolteacher Pauline Roland. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to recruit George Sand. Feminism was treated as a threat due to its ties with socialism, which was scrutinized since the Revolution. Deroin and Roland were both arrested, tried, and imprisoned in 1849. With the emergence of a new, more conservative government in 1852, feminism would have to wait until the Third French Republic.

While the word &quot;féminisme&quot; previously existed to describe the qualities of women, the word &quot;féministe&quot; was coined in 1872 by Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot; to refer to liberated women.

The Groupe Français d&#x27;Etudes Féministes were women intellectuals at the beginning of the 20th century who translated part of Bachofen&#x27;s canon into French and campaigned for the family law reform. In 1905, they founded &quot;L&#x27;entente&quot;, which published articles on women&#x27;s history, and became the focus for the intellectual avant-garde. It advocated for women&#x27;s entry into higher education and the male-dominated professions. Meanwhile, the Parti Socialiste Féminin socialist feminists, adopted a Marxist version of matriarchy. Like the Groupe Français, they toiled for a new age of equality, not for a return to prehistoric models of matriarchy. French feminism of the late 20th century is mainly associated with psychoanalytic feminist theory, particularly the work of Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, and Hélène Cixous.

=== Germany ===

Modern feminism in Germany began during the Wilhelmine period (1888–1918) with feminists pressuring a range of traditional institutions, from universities to government, to open their doors to women. The organized German women&#x27;s movement is widely attributed to writer and feminist Louise Otto-Peters (1819–1895). This movement culminated in women&#x27;s suffrage in 1919. Later waves of feminists continued to ask for legal and social equality in public and family life. Alice Schwarzer is the most prominent contemporary German feminist.

=== Iran ===
The Iranian women&#x27;s rights movement first emerged some time after the Iranian Constitutional Revolution, in the year in which the first women&#x27;s journal was published, 1910. The status of women deteriorated after the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The movement later grew again under feminist figures such as Bibi Khanoom Astarabadi, Touba Azmoudeh, Sediqeh Dowlatabadi, Mohtaram Eskandari, Roshank No&#x27;doost, Afaq Parsa, Fakhr ozma Arghoun, Shahnaz Azad, Noor-ol-Hoda Mangeneh, Zandokht Shirazi, Maryam Amid (Mariam Mozayen-ol Sadat).

In 1992, Shahla Sherkat founded &quot;Zanan&quot; (&quot;Women&quot;) magazine, which covered Iranian women&#x27;s concerns and tested political boundaries with edgy reportage on reform politics, domestic abuse, and sex. It is the most important Iranian women&#x27;s journal published after the Iranian revolution. It systematically criticized the Islamic legal code and argued that gender equality is Islamic and religious literature had been misread and misappropriated by misogynists. Mehangiz Kar, Shahla Lahiji, and Shahla Sherkat, the editor of &quot;Zanan&quot;, lead the debate on women&#x27;s rights and demanded reforms. On August 27, 2006, the One Million Signatures Iranian women&#x27;s rights campaign was started. It aims to end legal discrimination against women in Iranian laws by collecting a million signatures. The campaign supporters include many Iranian women&#x27;s rights activists, international activists, and Nobel laureates. The most important post-revolution feminist figures are Mehrangiz Kar, Azam Taleghani, Shahla Sherkat, Parvin Ardalan, Noushin Ahmadi khorasani, and Shadi Sadr.

=== Egypt ===

In 1899, Qasim Amin, considered the &quot;father&quot; of Arab feminism, wrote &quot;The Liberation of Women&quot;, which argued for legal and social reforms for women. Hoda Shaarawi founded the Egyptian Feminist Union in 1923 and became its president and a symbol of the Arab women&#x27;s rights movement. Arab feminism was closely connected with Arab nationalism. In 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser&#x27;s government initiated &quot;state feminism&quot;, which outlawed gender-based discrimination and granted women&#x27;s suffrage. Despite these reforms, &quot;state feminism&quot; blocked feminist political activism and brought an end to the first-wave feminist movement in Egypt. During Anwar Sadat&#x27;s presidency, his wife, Jehan Sadat, publicly advocated for expansion of women&#x27;s rights, though Egyptian policy and society was in retreat from women&#x27;s equality with the new Islamist movement and growing conservatism. However, writers such as Al Ghazali Harb, for example, argued that women&#x27;s full equality is an important part of Islam. This position formed a new feminist movement, Islamic feminism, which is still active today.

=== India ===

A new generation of Indian feminists emerged following global feminism. Indian women have greater independence from increased access to higher education and control over their reproductive rights. Medha Patkar, Madhu Kishwar, and Brinda Karat are feminist social workers and politicians who advocate for women&#x27;s rights in post-independence India. Writers such as Amrita Pritam, Sarojini Sahoo, and Kusum Ansal advocate for feminist ideas in Indian languages. Rajeshwari Sunder Rajan, Leela Kasturi, and Vidyut Bhagat are Indian feminist essayists and critics writing in English.

=== China ===
 Feminism in China began in the late Qing period as Chinese society re-evaluated traditional and Confucian values such as foot binding and gender segregation, and began to reject traditional gender ideas as hindering progress towards modernization. During the 1898 Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, reformers called for women&#x27;s education, gender equality, and the end of foot binding. Female reformers formed the first Chinese women&#x27;s society, the Society for the Diffusion of Knowledge among Chinese Women (&quot;Nüxuehui&quot;). After the Qing dynasty&#x27;s collapse, women&#x27;s liberation became a goal of the May Fourth Movement and the New Culture Movement. Later, the Chinese Communist Revolution adopted women&#x27;s liberation as one of its aims and promoted women&#x27;s equality, especially regarding women&#x27;s participation in the workforce. After the revolution and progress in integrating women into the workforce, the Chinese Communist Party claimed to have successfully achieved women&#x27;s liberation, and women&#x27;s inequality was no longer seen as a problem.

Second- and third-wave feminism in China was characterized by a re-examination of women&#x27;s roles during the reform movements of the early 20th century and the ways in which feminism was adopted by those various movements in order to achieve their goals. Later and current feminists have questioned whether gender equality has actually been fully achieved, and discuss current gender problems, such as the large gender disparity in the population.

=== Japan ===

Japanese feminism as an organized political movement dates back to the early years of the 20th century when Kato Shidzue pushed for birth control availability as part of a broad spectrum of progressive reforms. Shidzue went on to serve in the National Diet following the defeat of Japan in World War II and the promulgation of the Peace Constitution by US forces. Other figures such as Hayashi Fumiko and Ariyoshi Sawako illustrate the broad socialist ideologies of Japanese feminism that seeks to accomplish broad goals rather than celebrate the individual achievements of powerful women.

=== Norway ===

Norwegian feminism&#x27;s political origins are in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Camilla Collett (1813–1895) is widely considered the first Norwegian feminist. Originating from a literary family, she wrote a novel and several articles on the difficulties facing women of her time, and, in particular, forced marriages. Amalie Skram (1846–1905), a naturalist writer, also served as the women&#x27;s voice.

The Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights was founded in 1884 by Gina Krog and Hagbart Berner. The organization raised issues related to women&#x27;s rights to education and economic self-determination, and, above all, universal suffrage. The Norwegian Parliament passed the women&#x27;s right to vote into law on June 11, 1913. Norway was the second country in Europe (after Finland) to have full suffrage for women.

=== Poland ===
The development of feminism in Poland (re-recreated in modern times in 1918) and Polish territories has traditionally been divided into seven successive &quot;waves&quot;.

Radical feminism emerged in 1920s Poland. Its chief representatives, Irena Krzywicka and Maria Morozowicz-Szczepkowska, advocated for women&#x27;s personal, social, and legal independence from men. Krzywicka and Tadeusz Żeleński both promoted planned parenthood, sexual education, rights to divorce and abortion, and equality of sexes. Krzywicka published a series of articles in &quot;Wiadomości Literackie&quot; in which she protested against interference by the Roman Catholic Church in the intimate lives of Poles.

After the Second World War, the Polish Communist state (established in 1948) forcefully promoted women&#x27;s emancipation at home and at work. However, during Communist rule (until 1989), feminism in general and second-wave feminism in particular were practically absent. Although feminist texts were produced in the 1950s and afterwards, they were usually controlled and generated by the Communist state. After the fall of Communism, the Polish government, dominated by Catholic political parties, introduced a &quot;de facto&quot; legal ban on abortions. Since then, some feminists have adopted argumentative strategies from the 1980s American pro-choice movement.

== Histories of selected feminist issues ==

=== Feminist theory ===
The sexuality and gender historian Nancy Cott distinguishes between &quot;modern feminism&quot; and its antecedents, particularly the struggle for suffrage. She argues that in the two decades surrounding the Nineteenth Amendment&#x27;s 1920 passage, the prior &quot;woman movement&quot; primarily concerned women as &quot;universal&quot; entities, whereas over this 20-year period, the movement prioritized social differentiation, attention to &quot;individuality&quot;, and diversity. New issues dealt more with gender as a social construct, gender identity, and relationships within and between genders. Politically, this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.

In the immediate postwar period, Simone de Beauvoir opposed the &quot;woman in the home&quot; norm. She introduced an existentialist dimension to feminism with the publication of &quot;Le Deuxième Sexe&quot; (&quot;The Second Sex&quot;) in 1949. While less an activist than a philosopher and novelist, she signed one of the Mouvement de Libération des Femmes manifestos.

The resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of what might be considered female-associated issues, such as concerns for the earth, spirituality, and environmental activism. The atmosphere this created reignited the study of and debate on matricentricity as a rejection of determinism, such as with Adrienne Rich in &quot;Of Woman Born&quot; and Marilyn French in &quot;Beyond Power&quot;. For socialist feminists like Evelyn Reed, patriarchy held the properties of capitalism.

Ann Taylor Allen describes the differences between the collective male pessimism of male intellectuals such as Ferdinand Tönnies, Max Weber, and Georg Simmel at the beginning of the 20th century, compared to the optimism of their female counterparts, whose contributions have largely been ignored by social historians of the era.

<text>Miami-Dade Transit (MDT) is the primary public transit authority of Miami, Florida and the greater Miami-Dade County area. It is the largest transit system in Florida and the 15th-largest transit system in the United States. As of , the system has rides per year, or about per weekday in . MDT operates the Metrobus with their paratransit STS systems run by LSF. MDT also operates two rail transit systems: Metrorail and Metromover.

Metrobus operates over 93 routes, including the South-Dade Transitway. MDT&#x27;s main transit stations are Government Center in Downtown, and the Miami Intermodal Center in Grapeland Heights, which can access the Miami International Airport.

Metrorail is composed of two rail lines (Green and Orange lines) with 23 stations radiating from the city center towards outlying neighborhoods north and south of Downtown. Metromover operates throughout the Downtown, Omni, and Brickell neighborhoods, and is composed of three rail loops and 22 stations. The opening of the Metrorail Orange Line in July 2012 significantly increased usage of the system. As of 2013, rail fares collected were $23 million/yr and it cost $78 million/yr to operate the rail system.

Tri-Rail is a separate entity and not controlled by MDT. Tri-Rail, a commuter rail system in the Miami metropolitan area, is directly connected at the Tri-Rail and Metrorail Transfer station, Miami Intermodal Center, and Government Center station.

== History ==
In 1960, the Dade County Commission passed an ordinance creating the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) to unify the different transit operations into one countywide service. This ordinance provided for the purchase, development, and operation of an adequate mass transit system by the County. These companies included the Miami Transit Company, Miami Beach Railway Company, South Miami Coach Lines, and Keys Transit Company on Key Biscayne and would be managed by National City Management Company. National City was dismissed as manager in 1974. Over the years and under various administrations, MTA evolved into the Metro-Dade Transportation Administration, the Metro-Dade Transit Agency, the Miami-Dade Transit Agency, and is now known simply as Miami-Dade Transit (MDT).

Miami-Dade Transit, a county department of more than 4,000 employees, is the largest transit agency in the state of Florida and accounts for more than half of the trips taken on public transit in the state. MDT operates an accessible, integrated system of 93-plus Metrobus routes; the Metrorail rapid transit system; Metromover, a free Downtown people mover system; and the Paratransit division&#x27;s Special Transportation Service. Metrobus routes cover more than 35-million miles annually, including limited service to Broward and Monroe counties. In 2004, MDT&#x27;s Metrorail, Metromover, and Metrobus transported more than 96 million passengers, compared to 85 million the previous year.

=== 2011 federal investigation ===
Miami-Dade Transit was undergoing a federal investigation by the Federal Transit Administration that includes several audits and a criminal investigation of the transit agency due to concerns over money mismanagement within the agency. This caused a freezing of federal funds being granted to the county agency. In late 2010 the county manager claimed that it was &#x27;not fraud&#x27; but rather accounting errors, poor management, and erroneous information given to the auditors that triggered the investigation, including a withdrawal of $15 million through the ECHO program that was made by a transit official two hours after a letter arrived in September 2010 from the FTA telling them withdrawals had been restricted. The investigation and lack of funding let to emergency service cuts to Metrorail, Metrobus, and Metromover being considered by the agency by the middle of 2011, six months into the investigation and lack of funding which began in November 2010, causing MDT to lose $185 million in grant money. Assistant county manager Ysela Llort became responsible for Miami-Dade Transit after director Harpal Kapoor left in April 2011. Additionally, funding for the Metrorail airport link was jeopardized by the funding freeze. The FTA decided to continue funding under strict control in order to keep service cuts from happening.

MDT headquarters are located in the Overtown Transit Village in Downtown Miami.

== Future ==

=== The SMART Program ===
The Strategic Miami Area Rapid Transit (SMART) Program involves the implementation of five rapid transit corridors in Miami-Dade County. It includes new extensions of the current Metrorail and Metromover systems as well as the introduction of new forms of rapid transit, such as bus rapid transit (BRT).

==== South-Dade Transitway (Bus Rapid Transit) ====
The South-Dade Transitway will become a gold standard bus rapid transit (BRT) line, including 2 terminals and 14 new iconic BRT stations, all featuring fare gates, center platform boarding, all-door and level boarding, next bus arrival screens, air-conditioned waiting areas, and other rail-like amenities. Signal preemption and level crossing gates will be implemented at various roadway intersections along the transitway. The BRT will use 60-foot New Flyer Xcelsior battery-electric articulated buses. The project should be completed by 2025.

==== North Corridor (Metrorail extension) ====
The North Corridor is an extension of the current Metrorail system along NW 27 Avenue from the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza station to the north county line. It will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will extend the Metrorail to a station at the Hard Rock Stadium, with a stop at the Miami-Dade College North Campus. The second phase will include the remainder of the project, with a total of eight new stations added.

==== Northeast Corridor (Commuter rail) ====

The Northeast Corridor will feature commuter rail service (potentially Tri-Rail), extending from MiamiCentral to the Aventura station along the existing Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) tracks. It will have seven stations for the service in Miami-Dade, with both of the terminal stations having access to Brightline. Service could begin as soon as 2032.

==== East-West Corridor (Bus Rapid Transit) ====
The East-West Corridor consists of three BRT routes on dedicated bus lanes running from Tamiami Terminal to the Miami Intermodal Center and Government Center, as well as through the Blue Lagoon area. One of the routes will go on dedicated lanes, mainly along SR 836, and include four stations between Tamiami Terminal and the Miami Intermodal Center.

In April 2023, the Miami-Dade Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) considered commuter rail service instead of BRT as the form of rapid transit for the reason that BRT is &quot;no longer seen as practical&quot; and that commuter rail service on the CSX Lehigh Spur has &quot;become more flexible [on cost].&quot; In January 2024, the TPO moved forward with the commuter rail plan as well as an alternative being Metromover along Flagler Street.

==== Beach Corridor (Metromover extensions and bus/trolley lanes) ====
The Beach Corridor includes three rapid transit projects. The first is an extension of the current Metromover system along Miami Avenue from the School Board station to NW 41st Street. The second, known as BayLink, is another Metromover extension along the southern edge of MacArthur Causeway to Miami Beach, with stations in between. BayLink could begin service as soon as 2028. The third is dedicated bus/trolley lanes along Washington Avenue from 5th Street to the Miami Beach Convention Center.

== Metrorail ==
Metrorail is an elevated heavy rail rapid transit system. It has two lines on of track with termini west of Hialeah, at Miami International Airport, and in Kendall.

Metrorail serves the urban core of Miami, connecting the urban centers of Miami International Airport, the Health District, Downtown Miami, and Brickell with the northern developed neighborhoods of Hialeah and Medley to the northwest, and to suburban The Roads, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, and South Miami, ending at Dadeland South in Kendall.

== Metromover ==
Metromover is a free, elevated, automated mass transit people mover that runs on three loops: the Downtown Inner Loop, Brickell Loop, and the Omni Loop. The systems total with 22 stations at roughly every two blocks in the greater Downtown area. Metromover serves the neighborhoods of Downtown, Arts &amp; Entertainment District, Brickell, Park West, and Overtown.

== Metrobus ==


The Metrobus network provides bus service throughout Miami-Dade County 365 days a year. It consists of about 93 routes and 880 buses, which connect most points in the county and part of southern Broward County as well. Seven of these routes operate around the clock: Routes 3, 11, 27, 38, 77 (last bus from Downtown Miami 1:10am, first bus from Downtown Miami 4:10am), L (No 24-hour service to Hialeah, all trips terminate at Northside Station) and S. Routes 246 Night Owl (served by LSF) &amp; Route 500 Midnight Owl (County operated) which operate from midnight to 5am. Most other routes operate from 4:30am to 1:30am. All Metrobuses are wheelchair accessible, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and all county buses except for private run routes are equipped with bicycle racks. Some privatized routes trucks are receiving bike racks but very limited.

Bus route 301 (Dade-Monroe Express) extends into Monroe County, reaching Marathon, where a transfer is available to a Key West Transit bus proceeding further into the Keys. With the appropriate bus transfers, one can travel all the way from Key West to Jupiter entirely on public-transit buses.

== Paratransit (STS) ==

Paratransit/Special Transportation Services (STS) is available for people with a mental or physical disability who cannot ride Metrobus, Metrorail, or Metromover. For $3.50 per one-way trip, STS offers shared-ride, door-to-door travel in accessible vehicles throughout most of Miami-Dade County, in some parts of south Broward County, and in the middle and northern Keys. STS operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including most holidays. Service is run by private company.

== Rates ==

&quot;The &quot;EASY Card&quot; system is a regional fare collection system with interoperable smartcards and equipment. The following information is specific to Miami-Dade Transit:&quot;

Since October 1, 2009, Miami-Dade Transit has used the EASY Card system for fare collection.

On December 13, 2009 paper-based bus transfers were discontinued, and bus-to-bus transfers are now free only when using an EASY Card or EASY Ticket.

* An EASY Card can be purchased for $2 at EASY Card sales outlets, vending machines in Metrorail stations, calling 3-1-1 in Miami-Dade County, or online. Money can be reloaded on to the card at the same places and locations. The card is durable plastic and lasts for 20 years from first use since 2013.
* Alternatively an EASY Ticket may be purchased with no sales charge. However EASY Tickets are limited to the fare type initially loaded onto it, and expire 60 days after purchase. EASY Tickets also may not be purchased online or via telephone.
* With the change, paper transfers are being eliminated on transit. People paying fares in cash will need to pay full fare when transferring. Transfers will be available only by paying with an EASY Card or Ticket and using the card again within 3 hours of boarding transit.

The current standard fare is $2.25 and reduced fare is $1.10. A standard monthly pass costs $112.50 and $56.25 for reduced fare (College Students). The monthly Metropass is loaded onto the EASY Card. Fare gates at all Metrorail stations does not accept any type of cash, and require an EASY Card/Ticket, contactless device, or contactless debit/credit card to enter and exit the stations.

Reduced fares are available only to Medicare recipients, people with disabilities, and Miami-Dade students in grades K-12. Fare is free to kids below tall with fare-paying rider. Full time college students may also purchase a College EASY Ticket to ride Metrobus or Metrorail at $56.25 at their college/university along with a valid Student ID. Miami-Dade County employees can also receive discounted monthly rates and pre-tax savings by enrolling in the Monthly Pass Payroll Deduction program.

All Miami-Dade senior citizens aged 65 years and older and with Social Security benefits ride free with a Golden Passport pass. Veterans residing in Miami-Dade and earning less than $22,000 annually ride free with the Patriot Passport pass.

As of August 21, 2019, and December 23, 2019 riders can use their smartphones/smartwatches and contactless credit/debt cards to board the Metrorail and Metrobus. (Accepting Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Fitbit Pay etc.).

As part of the Better Bus Routes bus network redesign, fares are currently eliminated for all modes of transit through the end of the year.

== Finances ==
In 2018, the annual operating expense was $552 million; annual revenue was $106 million. Each passenger trip cost $6.77. One-way rides on Metrobus and Metrorails cost $2.25; rides on Metromover were free of charge to passengers.

== Passenger ridership ==

In February 2011, Miami-Dade Transit ridership totaled 336,067 passengers, including all Metrorail, Metromover and Metrobus lines. With a population of about 2.5 million in Miami-Dade County, Miami-Dade Transit accounts for 15% of the population&#x27;s daily mode of transportation. Note: This figure does not include Tri-Rail, Miami&#x27;s commuter rail operator.

Since the debut of Uber in the Miami area ridership has decreased each year, especially on the buses. By 2018, there were fewer riders than in 1999. In 2018, Metrorail and Metromover began to shut down earlier in the evening; the peak in-service fleet was cut by 4%; and service miles were cut by 2 million.

<doc id="573943" wikidata="Q249682" url="?curid=573943" title="General protection fault">
<text>A general protection fault (GPF) in the x86 instruction set architectures (ISAs) is a fault (a type of interrupt) initiated by ISA-defined protection mechanisms in response to an access violation caused by some running code, either in the kernel or a user program. The mechanism is first described in Intel manuals and datasheets for the Intel 80286 CPU, which was introduced in 1983; it is also described in section 9.8.13 in the Intel 80386 programmer&#x27;s reference manual from 1986. A general protection fault is implemented as an interrupt (vector number 13 (0Dh)). Some operating systems may also classify some exceptions not related to access violations, such as illegal opcode exceptions, as general protection faults, even though they have nothing to do with memory protection. If a CPU detects a protection violation, it stops executing the code and sends a GPF interrupt. In most cases, the operating system removes the failing process from the execution queue, signals the user, and continues executing other processes. If, however, the operating system fails to catch the general protection fault, i.e. another protection violation occurs before the operating system returns from the previous GPF interrupt, the CPU signals a double fault, stopping the operating system. If yet another failure (triple fault) occurs, the CPU is unable to recover; since 80286, the CPU enters a special halt state called &quot;Shutdown&quot;, which can only be exited through a hardware reset. The IBM PC AT, the first PC-compatible system to contain an 80286, has hardware that detects the Shutdown state and automatically resets the CPU when it occurs. All descendants of the PC AT do the same, so in a PC, a triple fault causes an immediate system reset.

== Specific behavior ==
=== Microsoft Windows ===

In Microsoft Windows, the general protection fault presents with varied language, depending on product version:
In Windows 95, 98 and Me, there is an alternate error message, used mostly with Windows 3.x programs: &quot;An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway, click Ignore and save your work in a new file. To quit this program, click Close. You will lose information you entered since your last save.&quot; Clicking &quot;Close&quot; results in one of the error messages above, depending on Windows version. &quot;Ignore&quot; sometimes does this too.

=== Unix ===
In Linux and other Unices, the errors are reported separately (e.g. segmentation fault for memory errors).

==Memory errors==
In memory errors, the faulting program accesses memory that it should not access. Examples include:

* Attempting to write to a read-only portion of memory
* Attempting to execute bytes in memory which are not designated as instructions
* Attempting to read as data bytes in memory which are designated as instructions
* Other miscellaneous conflicts between the designation of a part of memory and its use

However, many modern operating systems implement their memory access-control schemes via paging instead of segmentation, so it is often the case that invalid memory references in operating systems such as Windows are reported via page faults instead of general protection faults. Operating systems typically provide an abstraction layer (such as exception handling or signals) that hides whatever internal processor mechanism was used to raise a memory access error from a program, for the purposes of providing a standard interface for handling many different types of processor-generated error conditions.

In terms of the x86 architecture, general protection faults are specific to segmentation-based protection when it comes to memory accesses. However, general protection faults are still used to report other protection violations (aside from memory access violations) when paging is used, such as the use of instructions not accessible from the current privilege level (CPL).

While it is theoretically possible for an operating system to utilize both paging and segmentation, for the most part, common operating systems typically rely on paging for the bulk of their memory access control needs.

==Privilege errors==
There are some things on a computer which are reserved for the exclusive use of the operating system. If a program which is not part of the operating system attempts to use one of these features, it may cause a general protection fault.

Additionally, there are storage locations which are reserved both for the operating system and the processor itself. As a consequence of their reservation, they are read-only and an attempt to write data to them by an unprivileged program produces an error.

==Technical causes for faults==
General protection faults are raised by the processor when a protected instruction is encountered which exceeds the permission level of the currently executing task, either because a user-mode program is attempting a protected instruction, or because the operating system has issued a request which would put the processor into an undefined state.

General protection faults are caught and handled by modern operating systems. Generally, if the fault originated in a user-mode program, the user-mode program is terminated. If, however, the fault originated in a core system driver or the operating system itself, the operating system usually saves diagnostic information either to a file or to the screen and stops operating. It either restarts the computer or displays an error screen, such as a Blue Screen of Death or kernel panic.

===Segment limits exceeded===
Segment limits can be exceeded:
* with code segment (CS), data segment (DS), or ES, FS, or GS (extra segment) registers; or
* accessing descriptor tables such as the Global Descriptor Table (GDT), the Interrupt descriptor table (IDT) and the Local Descriptor Table (LDT).

===Segment permissions violated===
Segment permissions can be violated by:
* jumping to non-executable segments
* writing to code segments, or read only segments
* reading execute-only segments

===Segments illegally loaded===
This can occur when:
* a stack segment (SS) is loaded with a segment selector for a read only, executable, null segment, or segment with descriptor privilege not matching the current privilege in CS
* a code segment (CS) loaded with a segment selector for a data, system, or null segment
* SS, DS, ES, FS, or GS are segments loaded with a segment selector for a system segment
* SS, DS, ES, FS, or GS are segments loaded with a segment selector for an execute-only code segment
* accessing memory using DS, ES, FS, or GS registers, when they contain a null selector

===Switching===
Faults can occur in the task state segment (TSS) structure when:
* switching to a busy task during a call or jump instruction
* switching to an available task during an interrupt return (IRET) instruction
* using a segment selector on a switch pointing to a TSS descriptor in the LDT

===Miscellaneous===
Other causes of general protection faults are:
* attempting to access an interrupt/exception handler from virtual 8086 mode when the handler&#x27;s code segment descriptor privilege level (DPL) is greater than zero
* attempting to write a one into the reserved bits of CR4
* attempting to execute privileged instructions when the current privilege level (CPL) is not zero
* attempting to execute a single instruction with a length greater than 15 bytes (possibly by prepending the instruction with superfluous prefixes)
* writing to a reserved bit in an MSR instruction
* accessing a gate containing a null segment selector
* executing a software interrupt when the CPL is greater than the DPL set for the interrupt gate
* the segment selector in a call, interrupt or trap gate does not point to a code segment
* violating privilege rules
* enabling paging whilst disabling protection
* referencing the interrupt descriptor table following an interrupt or exception that is not an interrupt, trap, or a task gate
* Legacy SSE: Memory operand is not 16-byte aligned.

<text>Tri-Rail is a commuter rail service linking Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in Florida, United States. The &quot;Tri&quot; prefix in the name refers to the three counties served by the railroad: Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade. Tri-Rail is managed by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) along CSX Transportation&#x27;s former Miami Subdivision; the line is now wholly owned by the Florida DOT. The system has 19 stations along the Southeast Florida coast, and connects directly to Amtrak at numerous stations, to Metrorail at the Metrorail Transfer station, Miami Airport station, and MiamiCentral, and to Brightline at MiamiCentral.

In , the line had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

A second Tri-Rail line on the Florida East Coast Railway corridor, dubbed the &quot;Coastal Link&quot;, has been proposed. The line would operate between Toney Penna station in Jupiter and MiamiCentral in Downtown Miami, and add commuter rail service between the downtown areas of cities between West Palm Beach and Miami. Combined with the existing Tri-Rail line, this expanded Tri-Rail system is estimated to have a daily passenger ridership of almost 30,000; or approximately 9 million passengers per annum, doubling Tri-Rail&#x27;s current ridership.

== History ==
=== 1920s: Seaboard-All Florida Railway ===

The line on which Tri-Rail operates was built by the Seaboard-All Florida Railway (a subsidiary of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad) for intercity passenger rail service in the early 1920s. The line was inaugurated on January 7, 1927. Intercity rail service by Seaboard operated the Orange Blossom Special service from New York City until 1953. Amtrak continues to offer passenger rail service with the &quot;Floridian&quot; train from Chicago and &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; train from New York City. Today, the original 1920s Seaboard stations are used by Tri-Rail for service at West Palm Beach, Deerfield Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood. Though no longer in use, the Seaboard stations at Delray Beach, Opa-locka and Hialeah are still standing.

=== 1980s–1990s: Planning and inauguration ===
Planning for a new commuter rail line began in 1983, and building the organization began in 1986. The current system was formed by the Florida Department of Transportation and began operation January 9, 1989, to provide temporary commuter rail service while construction crews widened Interstate 95 and the parallel Florida&#x27;s Turnpike. Tri-Rail was free from opening until June 1, 1989.

Due to higher than expected ridership, FDOT made Tri-Rail a permanent service, adding more trains and stations in the process. The state&#x27;s original plan was to use the more urban Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) line, but FEC declined the offer as it wanted freight to be their top priority. In 1998, the initial route was extended north from the West Palm Beach station to the , and south from to Miami Airport (at an earlier station on the site of the current station). Construction of the extensions began in 1996; which added nearly to the system.

=== 2000s: New stations, more service ===

In the early 2000s, Tri-Rail received a budget of $84.8 million for double tracking, building extensions, improving stations, establishing a headquarters, and linking to buses.

In 2002, Tri-Rail began to upgrade its grade crossings to include raised medians and/or four quadrant gates to prevent cars from driving around them in an attempt to beat trains. This decreases accidents and allows the cities they run through to petition for them not to use their whistle between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. They also decreased headways to 20 minutes during rush hours.
In 2007, a project to upgrade the full length of the line from Mangonia Park to Miami Airport with double track was completed with the opening of a high-level fixed bridge over the New River near Fort Lauderdale. During the 2000s, most of the stations were completely rebuilt to accommodate for double-tracking and include dual platforms, elevators, pedestrian bridges over the tracks, large roofs over the platforms, and better facilities.

In March 2006, Tri-Rail went from 30 passenger trains a day to 40 trains; the completion of the New River rail bridge, the double-tracking project, and the addition of a second Colorado Railcar diesel multiple unit (DMU) ushered in sweeping changes to Tri-Rail&#x27;s operational timetables. Tri-Rail added several more trains during peak weekday commuting hours in June 2007, increasing to the current 50 trains per day, as well as increasing weekend service. During &quot;rush-hour,&quot; trains ran every twenty to thirty minutes rather than the previous schedule of every hour. This change comes at quite a fortuitous time in Tri-Rail&#x27;s operation history. With gasoline prices at record highs—particularly in South Florida&#x27;s sprawling metropolis—Tri-Rail saw a double-digit percentage increase in ridership in mid-2007. By 2009, annual ridership had reached about 4.2 million passengers. This was also the time during which work was being done on I-95 to add the express lanes from the Golden Glades Interchange to the Airport Expressway near Downtown Miami. In 2007, Veolia Transport commenced operating the Tri-Rail service under a contract that ran until June 2017.

=== 20092022: Growth and Airport Station ===
In 2009, Tri-Rail service was nearly cut drastically, with the threat of being shut down altogether by 2011, even as ridership was at a record high, as Palm Beach County withheld its funding of the system and looked to cut its funding from $4.1 million to $1.6 million per year. This would mean that Broward and Miami-Dade counties would also have had to cut their support to $1.6 million each to match. The state, which was also running a budget shortfall and did not pass a rental car tax increase to help fund Tri-Rail, would have had to cut its support as well. This would have caused an immediate cut from 50 to 30 daily trains and a complete cutting weekend service, followed by additional cuts and possible shut down two years later. Schedules were decreased slightly, but service was never cut altogether, as dedicated federal funding was attained through the $2.5 million grant as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009.

After a 25% fare increase in mid-2009, annual ridership dropped by 15% (about 600,000) in 2010. However, in 2011, Tri-Rail again saw increasing ridership due to sustained high gas prices, averaging about 14,500 riders per weekday by the end of year. Throughout the year, ridership increased at a rate of about 11% per month, paired with a decline in automobile travel and an increase in employment, with 285 companies and 2,829 individuals joining in the discount program.

In 2011, the dilapidated Pompano Beach station received a $5.7 million federal grant, to be redone as a &quot;green station,&quot; generating more than 100% of its energy demand through solar power, with the excess to be sent to the grid or stored for nighttime lighting. Construction started in spring 2012 with the station remaining open during construction. The crossing of Race Track Road and the Tri-Rail line near the Pompano Beach station, rough for several years, was also repaired in 2012.

In early 2012, it was announced that a second Tri-Rail station in Boca Raton was once again being considered at the busy intersection of Glades Road (S.R. 808) and Military Trail (S.R. 809), near Town Center Mall, Florida Atlantic University and large office parks. A station was proposed for this location in the early 2000s while many other stations were being renovated. Boca Raton station near Yamato Road (S.R. 794) is the busiest station in the system as of 2014, with 1,600 riders a day, surpassing the Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station in Miami-Dade County. For this reason, and the fact that Glades Road is considered the most congested road in the county, an infill station there has been long considered. However, in 2019, plans for the station were ultimately canceled by the city and Tri-Rail.

Total ridership on the system fully recovered to earlier high levels in fiscal year 2013, to 4.2 million. Tri-Rail wanted to double ridership by 2021 to 30,000 daily riders by building the Coastal Link.
In April 2015, Miami Airport station opened at the Miami Intermodal Center, once again connecting Tri-Rail directly with the Miami International Airport for the first time since the original Miami Airport station closed in 2011. This new station has connections to MIA Mover (providing a direct link to the airport), Metrorail, Metrobus and Greyhound. After extensive delays, Amtrak has yet to move its operations from its current station. This new station was under construction since 2009, with a September 2011 closure of the original Miami Airport station to allow for construction of the new station.

On January 27, 2017, the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority board voted to award Herzog Transit Services a $511 million, 10-year contract to operate Tri-Rail beginning in July 2017. The board disqualified the other five bidders (Amtrak, Bombardier, First Transit, SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit and incumbent operator Transdev), stating that they had all submitted &quot;conditional&quot; prices despite the request for proposals mandating that the bid price be final. The other five losing bidders all protested the contract, with Transdev, Bombardier, and First Transit jointly requesting a court injunction to prevent it from being awarded.

=== 2023present: Livery redesign and MiamiCentral service ===

In the first quarter of 2023, the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) reported a 25% increase in Tri-Rail ridership, surpassing 350,000 riders for the first time in three years. To meet the demand, the SFRTA began an overhaul process with their Brookville locomotives, which is anticipated to be completed by 2025, and received a federal grant that will allow the replacement of a third of the aging fleet of railcars with new ones, which are expected to start service in the coming years. In addition, the SFRTA created a new livery design, which debuted in time for the Tri-Rail service into MiamiCentral.

Tri-Rail service to MiamiCentral (Tri-Rail Downtown Miami Link) began service on January 13, 2024. The station, which is also a mixed-use complex, is located in Downtown Miami and includes direct access to Brightline as well as Miami-Dade Transit services. The initial service consists of a shuttle service between Metrorail Transfer station and MiamiCentral, but a MiamiCentral Express train has since been added, running from MiamiCentral to West Palm Beach station. To continue traveling north or south, a transfer is required. It marks the first time Tri-Rail trains use Florida East Coast&#x27;s trackage for service. Tri-Rail trains switch to the FEC&#x27;s Little River Branch on the Iris Connection south of Metrorail Transfer station and head east to the FEC mainline, where they turn south and head to Downtown Miami. Tri-Rail trains began testing the corridor on June 19, 2023. The total cost of accommodating Tri-Rail trains in MiamiCentral was about $70 million.

With the Brightline extension to Orlando, the company has indicated that their trains have reached capacity, especially during peak commute time along the Southeast Florida region. As a result of this, Brightline proposed for the SFRTA to facilitate a between the West Palm Beach station and MiamiCentral, with few stops in between. This would be similar to the route Brightline currently services in Southeast Florida. On May 31, 2024, the SFRTA announced that the new weekday rush hour express train, with stops at Boca Raton, Fort Lauderdale Airport, and Metrorail Transfer, which began service on July 1, 2024.

== Extensions and upgrades ==

=== Proposed routes ===

==== Coastal Link (FEC line service) ====
In the 2025 and 2030 long-range transportation plans, Tri-Rail has envisioned moving to or adding service on the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) corridor, which runs parallel to U.S. 1 (Biscayne Boulevard/Brickell Avenue in Miami-Dade County, and Federal Highway in Broward and Palm Beach counties). This corridor will provide more opportunities for pedestrian travel from stations to end destinations than does the current South Florida Rail Corridor, which must rely almost exclusively on shuttle buses for passenger distribution. Tri-Rail officials project that the project would cost about $2.5 billion and that 59,000 people per day would ride it, The FEC, which denied the state&#x27;s request to use the line for commuter rail in the 1980s, is now under new ownership as of 2017, and has now stated that it is willing to allow the use of the segment of track between downtown Miami and Jupiter for passenger trains.

Tri-Rail service on the FEC line would bring stations to Downtown Miami&#x27;s transit hub, Government Center station via MiamiCentral, as well as service in Midtown Miami/Miami Design District, Upper East Side/Miami Shores, North Miami, North Miami Beach/Aventura, Downtown Hollywood, and Downtown Fort Lauderdale, putting it within walking distance of thousands of potential riders. Getting to and from the current stations has been a major detractor of Tri-Rail&#x27;s convenience since opening. Miami&#x27;s Downtown Development Authority along with Miami-area politicians are actively lobbying to bring Tri-Rail to the city core.

Track connections between the FEC tracks and the South Florida Rail Corridor are also currently under construction. These connections are mainly for freight connectivity between the two lines, but are planned for future Coastal Link use. The Northwood Connection just north of West Palm Beach will provide a new connection as well as rehabilitating an existing connection. The Iris Connection will connect the SFRC to the FEC&#x27;s Little River Branch near Hialeah. FDOT has built both connections, which were funded by a federal TIGER grant.

The Coastal Link is planned to begin in phases. The first phase is known as Tri-Rail Downtown Miami Link, which began service on January 13, 2024.

A later phase would allow Tri-Rail to begin service to Jupiter by having trains switch to the FEC on the new Northwood connection north of West Palm Beach and head north to Jupiter with additional stops in Palm Beach Gardens, Lake Park and Riviera Beach. No official timeframe has been given for this phase.

Miami-Dade County is also working to find funding for service on the FEC from Downtown Miami as far north as Aventura. Construction of an additional track for commuter service would require the approval of Brightline, which owns trackage rights to operate passenger trains over the corridor.

If the Coastal Link is fully implemented, Tri-Rail would operate in three separate services with a line on the FEC tracks from Jupiter to Downtown Fort Lauderdale, a line on the existing tracks from Mangonia Park to Pompano Beach, and then transition to the FEC tracks and continue to Downtown Miami. Another line would run on the existing tracks from Boca Raton to Miami Airport.

Before full implementation of the Coastal Link service can begin, officials have acknowledged that a new crossing over (or under) the New River in Fort Lauderdale is necessary. The FEC&#x27;s current low-level drawbridge is unable to handle Tri-Rail service along with Brightline and FEC freight service without negatively affecting vessel traffic on the river since the bridge would need to be lowered quite often. Proposals include a taller bridge or possibly a tunnel under the river.

In 2020, Brightline solicited a proposal to operate a commuter rail service on the FEC, utilizing its exclusive trackage rights for passenger service, under a different system known as the Northeast Corridor Rapid Transit Project. Under these plans the city of Miami would support the service operated by Brightline, without direct involvement of Tri-Rail.

==== Homestead and Doral (CSX Homestead Subdivision line service) ====
There had been proposals in the past by Miami-Dade County and CSX Transportation to use the CSX Homestead Subdivision for Tri-Rail service, with the corridor being purchased by the county or the Florida Department of Transportation. However, one of the problems at the time was that the price of the corridor was exorbitant. Since then, CSX has had new leadership, and the company is now willing to make a deal with Miami-Dade County to potentially have passenger rail service initiated on the corridor. Service could include the Lehigh spur from the Miami Intermodal Center to Doral, as well as the Homestead Subdivision from the Miami Intermodal Center to Homestead. , both lines only see sporadic freight service, and the southernmost of the Homestead Subdivision (south of the Gold Coast Railroad Museum) have been out of service .

=== Proposed stations ===

==== VA Medical Center station ====
Tri-Rail is currently in the preliminary stages of adding a station near the VA Medical Center northwest of the Mangonia Park station. The tracks northwest of Mangonia Park are currently owned by CSX Transportation, which Tri-Rail would need to have an agreement with to operate at the potential new station. Palm Beach County is expected to cover the costs of the project.

==== Little River station ====
In November 2023, Swerdlow Group responded to a request for proposals from Miami-Dade County for a new affordable housing development in Little River, which also includes a Tri-Rail station. The project is located just east of I-95 and just north of the FEC&#x27;s Little River Branch, which is part of the current route of the Tri-Rail Downtown Miami Link, which has no stations along the east-west route (with the north-south route eventually having stations as the result of the Northeast Corridor Rapid Transit Project). Swerdlow Group had indicated that they would fund $20 million for the station.

== Operations ==
Tri-Rail shares the South Florida Rail Corridor trackage with Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor,&quot; &quot;Floridian,&quot; and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Miami Subdivision. The Florida Department of Transportation purchased the track from CSX in 1989. Under the terms of the agreement, CSX would continue to provide dispatch services and physical plant maintenance for the track and would have exclusive freight trackage rights until certain conditions were met. At midnight on March 29, 2015, CSX handed over dispatching and maintenance to SFRTA (Tri-Rail). While this should have the advantage of giving passenger trains signal priority over freight trains, it was at first wracked with delays.

Tri-Rail participates in the EASY Card regional smartcard-based fare collection system along with Miami-Dade Transit. Purely paper tickets are also available for same-day or weekend use. A paper ticket or an EASY Card with a paper-based transfer receipt (created after a confirmed trip is completed) can be used to obtain transfer discounts when transferring to Broward County Transit as well as Palm Tran. However, only EASY Cards may be used to obtain a transfer discount when transferring to Miami-Dade Transit.

Due to the route&#x27;s success, Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Floridian&quot; do not allow local travel between West Palm Beach and Miami. The two trains only stop to discharge passengers southbound and receive passengers northbound. This policy is in place to make seats on those two trains available for passengers making longer trips.

=== Fares and services ===
Tri-Rail fare is divided into six zones for 24-hour passes, ranging from $2.50 to $8.75, with fare calculated by the number of zones traveled through, and whether it is one-way or round trip. On weekends, a $5 all-day pass good for all zones is available, though trains run hourly headways. For frequent use, Tri-Rail offers a $110 monthly pass (good for Tri-Rail only) and a $155 regional monthly pass (good on Tri-Rail, Metrorail, and Metrobus). Discount fares are available for senior citizens, the disabled, students, and children under 12. Certain businesses allow their employees to register for the Employer Discount Program, which reduces their fares by 25%. Free parking is available at all Tri-Rail stations. On weekdays, 50 train trips are made in all, with 25 in each direction, while on weekends only 30 trips, 15 north and 15 south, are made in all, with 1-hour headways between each train. While Tri-Rail peaks at speeds of , it can be extracted from the timetable and the distance of the line that its overall average speed is approximately .

=== Revenue and expense ===
For fiscal year 2010, train revenue was approximately $10.3 million. Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2010, including depreciation expense, were approximately $86.9 million. Expenses increased by approximately $14.9 million or 20.7% when compared to fiscal year 2009. 2010 was a low year for ridership after the economy crashed and there were service cuts. By 2015, ridership was about 25% higher. By 2018, fare revenue was budgeted at $13.4 million, whereas operating expense was $119.8 million.

=== Travel direction ===
The line has no turn around point so all trains will face one direction at all times. Locomotives will always face south. For this reason, Dual Operation Passenger Cabs are located on the opposite side of the train facing north. Trains will travel north in reverse and south forwards.

== Stations ==

A typical station contains two tracks and two side platforms connected by an overpass. Most stations have large parking lots, however, some, like West Palm Beach and Hollywood have a limited number of spaces, most of which are reserved for Amtrak travelers.
== Ridership ==

Annual ridership averages
=== Ridership records ===
Tri-Rail posted its highest-paid daily ridership in the commuter-rail system&#x27;s 24-year history on June 24, 2013. It transported 19,060 people, many of whom attended a &quot;victory parade&quot; for the Miami Heat, which won the 2013 National Basketball Association championship. Most trains operated at or near capacity, SFTRA officials said in a press release. Special four-car sets were operated to accommodate the anticipated overflow crowd.

Previous Miami Heat victory parades resulted in high ridership counts for Tri-Rail, as well. On June 23, 2006, Tri-Rail transported 18,613 riders; and on June 25, 2012, the agency carried 18,355 passengers. In 2019, TriRail reached its highest annual ridership with 4.5 million riders.

== Rolling stock ==
=== Locomotives ===
The service began with five F40PHL-2 diesel locomotives. Tri-Rail later took delivery of three F40PH-2C locomotives and two ex-Amtrak EMD F40PHRs (Now upgraded to 3C specifications and electronics). In 2006, six EMD GP49 locomotives were acquired from Norfolk Southern and were rebuilt by Mid America Car Company to the designation GP49H-3.

On October 29, 2008, the Tri-Rail switched to biodiesel fuel with a goal of a 99-percent blend, when available.

On February 25, 2011, Tri-Rail announced an order for ten Brookville BL36PH locomotives, with options for 13 more, from the Brookville Equipment Corporation at a cost of $109 million. The purchase was met with criticism by the Florida Chamber of Commerce and state lawmakers, who claimed the bidding process was flawed. Rival bidder MotivePower filed a lawsuit against Tri-Rail, claiming that the bidding process was skewed in Brookville&#x27;s favour. Tri-Rail later added two more BL36PH locomotives to the order for a total of 12. As of 2015, all locomotives have been delivered and are used in regular service, allowing the F40PHL-2, F40PH-2C, and F40PH locomotives to be retired. However, in July 2018, all the F40PHM-2C and F40PHR locomotives were sent up to Progress Rail in Patterson, Georgia to be rebuilt and returned to service for use on the Coastal Link. They were returned from August 2020 to January 2021, and have been put back in service on the RTA mainline.

=== Passenger cars ===
Tri-Rail uses two types of passenger cars. Since the beginning of operations, the system has used 26 Bombardier BiLevel Coaches purchased new from Urban Transportation Development Corporation (even though they were delivered in GO Transit colors, the Tri-Rail cars were purchased new and never used or sold secondhand by GO, only leased by GO for a short period of time), a common model among Canadian and US commuter railroads, 11 with operating cabs and 15 without. Briefly, bi-level rolling stock from Colorado Railcar (4 DMU power coaches and 2 unpowered coaches) was used beginning in 2006.

In 2010, the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority agreed to purchase new rail cars from Hyundai Rotem for $95 million. The first new car was put into service in March 2011. By late 2011, the 12 new locomotives and 24 new passenger cars had not yet been delivered, and the original cars, many over 30 years old, were falling into disrepair. This led to Tri-Rail often running two cars per train instead of three despite increasing ridership, leaving only standing room on many trains during rush hour. By January 2013, all trains were again running with 3 cars, just as most of the Hyundai Rotem rail cars were delivered. In addition to decreased comfort but more reliability, the new cars provide additional safety with front and rear crumple zones designed to absorb energy in a crash.

In 2015, three Bombardier coaches were renovated to include additional bicycle capacity. Cars 1002, 1006, and 1007 had one side of seating removed from the lower levels, which were in turn replaced by bike racks. These trains with special bike cars have the capacity to carry an additional 14 bicycles per train.

=== Diesel multiple units ===
In 2003, after receiving a grant from the Florida Department of Transportation, Tri-Rail contracted to purchase two pieces of rolling stock from Colorado Railcar: a self-propelled diesel multiple unit (DMU) prototype control car and unpowered bi-level coach entered regular service with Tri-Rail in October 2006. The new purpose-built railcars are larger than the Bombardier BiLevel Coaches, holding up to 188 passengers, with room for bicycles and luggage. Tri-Rail possessed four DMU control cars and two unpowered trailer cars. One DMU train usually consists of two DMU power cars at each end of a trailer coach (making for two complete DMU+trailer+DMU sets on the system). Throughout their short careers, the cars suffered from many mechanical issues. Because of this all the cars were placed in permanent storage in 2012. As of 2024, all the DMUs and trailers have been retired with 704, 7001, and 7002 sold to the Indiana Railway Museum for excursion train service and are now off the property.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On January 4, 2016, a passenger train collided with a garbage truck which had broken down on a grade crossing at Lake Worth Beach station and derailed. Twenty-two people were injured. This marked the first derailment in almost 27 years of operation.

On January 28, 2016, Tri-Rail suffered their second derailment in Pompano Beach, after a train hit debris on the tracks between the Cypress Creek and Pompano Beach stations. This section of track is also where Tri-Rail is allowed to go its fastest speed, 79 MPH. One injury was reported and GP49H-3 locomotive #813 and a Bombardier BiLevel Coach directly behind it came off the rail.

On October 25, 2019, a northbound Tri-Rail train led by Bombardier cabcar #509 hit a semitruck in Oakland Park. Several people were injured, and cabcar 509 was sidelined after the incident.

On August 19, 2020 at Deerfield Beach, GP49H-3 locomotive 816 caught on fire and its passengers from the train were safely evacuated. No injuries were reported.

On August 27, 2022, a northbound Tri-Rail train hit a vehicle left on the tracks in Fort Lauderdale. 6 people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries. The train partially derailed as a result of the impact.

<text>The Right Opposition () was an alliance of Georgia&#x27;s New Rights (Conservatives) and Industry Will Save Georgia parties. It was the only opposition group that received over seven percent of the votes in the 2004 Georgian parliamentary election, passing the electoral threshold to secure seats in Parliament. 

==History==

The alliance was formed prior to the 2004 Georgian parliamentary election, which was held after the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia. Both New Rights and the Industry Will Save Georgia refused to join rallies of the other opposition parties during the Rose Revolution, criticizing its leaders and distancing from the event.

After the 2004 parliamentary election, both the Right Opposition and National Movement traded allegations of vote rigging. However, neither of these claims were substantiated by observers from the European Union in their subsequent report on the elections. The coalition initially gained fifteen of the 150 seats that were elected by party list, but the votes in several of these constituencies were annulled after the elections. They had also retained two seats from single-mandate constituencies which they gained in the 2003 Georgian parliamentary election, the results of which were largely annulled after the Rose Revolution.

Both New Rights and Industrialists found their support largely in the private enterprise community and were particularly popular with those employed in the private sector. As a result, for years the two parties fought each other for the same electorate. While the alliance was formed only weeks before the 2004 elections, the party leaders subsequently agreed to merge their two groups into one party, forming the center-right alternative to initially center-left National Movement, which won the 2004 parliamentary election and became the governing party in Georgia.

==Platform==
The alliance&#x27;s main political priorities included securing a flat tax system in Georgia; reducing government regulations on business; increasing economic growth and job creation in the private sector; rising defense spending and securing NATO membership no later than 2010; and promoting liberal democratic political institutions. The alliance also supported creating a &quot;common trade area in South Caucasian region&quot; and restoration of Georgia&#x27;s territorial integrity by creating a common economic projects with the Georgia&#x27;s breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

<doc id="573969" wikidata="Q460151" url="?curid=573969" title="Fred M. Vinson">
<text>Frederick Moore Vinson (January 22, 1890 – September 8, 1953) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 13th chief justice of the United States from 1946 until his death in 1953. Vinson was one of the few Americans to have served in all three branches of the U.S. government. Before becoming chief justice, Vinson served as a U.S. Representative from Kentucky from 1924 to 1928 and 1930 to 1938, as a federal appellate judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1938 to 1943, and as the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury from 1945 to 1946.

Born in Louisa, Kentucky, Vinson pursued a legal career and served in the U.S. Army during World War I. After the war, he served as the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for the Thirty-Second Judicial District of Kentucky before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1924. He lost re-election in 1928 but regained his seat in 1930 and served in Congress until 1937. During his time in Congress, he became an adviser and confidante of Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman. In 1937, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Vinson to be a judge on the D.C. Circuit. Vinson resigned from the appellate court in 1943, when he became the Director of the Office of Economic Stabilization. After Truman acceded to the presidency following Roosevelt&#x27;s death in 1945, Truman appointed Vinson to the position of Secretary of the Treasury. Vinson negotiated the payment of the Anglo-American loan and presided over the establishment of numerous post-war organizations, including the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (commonly called the World Bank) and the International Monetary Fund.

After the death of Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone in 1946, Truman appointed Vinson to the Supreme Court. Vinson dissented in the case of &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;, which ruled against the Truman administration&#x27;s control of the nation&#x27;s steel mills during a strike. He ordered a rehearing of the &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; case, which was eventually combined into the case known as &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

==Early years==

Vinson, known universally as Fred, was born in the newly built, eight-room, red brick house in front of the Lawrence County jail in Louisa, Kentucky, where his father served as the Lawrence County Jailer. As a child he would help his father in the jail and even made friends with prisoners who would remember his kindness when he later ran for public office. Vinson worked odd jobs while in school. He graduated from Kentucky Normal School in 1909 and enrolled at Centre College, where he graduated at the top of his class with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While at Centre, he was a member of the Kentucky Alpha Delta chapter of Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He received a Bachelor of Laws from the now defunct College of Law. He entered private practice in Louisa. He first ran for and was elected to office as the City Attorney of Louisa.

Vinson joined the Army as a private during World War I. Following the war, he was elected as the Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for the Thirty-Second Judicial District of Kentucky. Vinson married Julia Roberta Dixon on January 24, 1924, in Ashland, Kentucky. They had two sons.

==United States Representative from Kentucky==

In 1924, Vinson ran in a special election for his district&#x27;s seat in Congress after William J. Fields resigned to become the Governor of Kentucky. Vinson was elected as a Democrat and then was reelected twice before losing in 1928. His loss was attributed to his refusal to dissociate his campaign from Alfred E. Smith&#x27;s presidential campaign. However, Vinson came back to win re-election in 1930, and he served in Congress through 1937.

While he was in Congress he befriended Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman, a friendship that would last throughout his life. He soon became a close advisor, confidant, card player, and dear friend to Truman. After Truman decided against running for another term as president in the early 1950s, he tried to convince a skeptical Vinson to seek the Democratic Party nomination, but Vinson turned down the President&#x27;s offer. After being equally unsuccessful in enlisting General Dwight D. Eisenhower, President Truman eventually landed on Governor of Illinois Adlai Stevenson as his preferred successor in the 1952 presidential election.

In 1930, former congressman Vinson moved his law practice from Louisa, Kentucky thirty miles north to Ashland. With aspirations to return to Washington, D.C. as congressman, Vinson formed a circle of Ashland friends who could aid him politically and professionally. This group included his next door neighbor Paul G. Blazer. Vinson returned to Washington, D.C. as congressman in 1931. Vinson would become a frontline supporter of President Roosevelt and his cabinet&#x27;s New Deal revolution.

==United States Court of Appeals==

Vinson was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on November 26, 1937, to an Associate Justice seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (now the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit) vacated by Associate Justice Charles Henry Robb. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 9 of that year, and received his commission six days later. He was designated by Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone to serve as Chief Judge of the Emergency Court of Appeals. His service terminated on May 28, 1943, due to his resignation.

==Secretary of the Treasury==
Vinson resigned from the bench to become Director of the Office of Economic Stabilization, an executive agency charged with fighting inflation. He also spent time as Federal Loan Administrator (March 6 to April 3, 1945) and director of War Mobilization and Reconversion (April 4 to July 22, 1945). He was appointed United States Secretary of the Treasury by President Truman and served from July 23, 1945, to June 23, 1946.

His mission as Secretary of the Treasury was to stabilize the American economy during the last months of the war and to adapt the United States financial position to the drastically changed circumstances of the postwar world. Before the war ended, Vinson directed the last of the great war-bond drives.

At the end of the war, he negotiated payment of the British Loan of 1946, the largest loan made by the United States to another country ($3.75 billion), and the lend-lease settlements of economic and military aid given to the allies during the war. In order to encourage private investment in postwar America, he promoted a tax cut in the Revenue Act of 1945. He also supervised the inauguration of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund, both created at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944, acting as the first chairman of their respective boards. In 1946, Vinson resigned from the Treasury to be appointed Chief Justice of the United States by Truman.

==Chief Justice==
Vinson was nominated by President Harry S. Truman on June 6, 1946, to become Chief Justice of the United States, following the death of Harlan F. Stone. Vinson was recommended to Truman by former chief justice Charles Evans Hughes and former associate justice Owen Roberts. Both noted Vinson&#x27;s experience in all three branches of the federal government, with Hughes telling Truman, &quot;You have a Secretary of the Treasury who has been a Congressman, a Judge of the Court of Appeal, and an executive officer in President Roosevelt&#x27;s and your cabinets&quot;. He was confirmed by the United States Senate by a voice vote on June 20, 1946, received his commission on June 21, and took the oath of office on June 24. His appointment came at a time when the Supreme Court was deeply fractured, both intellectually and personally. One faction was led by Justice Hugo Black, the other by Justice Felix Frankfurter. Vinson was credited with patching this fracture, at least on a personal level. He was the presiding officer of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges (now the Judicial Conference of the United States) from 1946 to 1948, and presiding officer of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1948 to 1953. In addition to his chief justiceship, Vinson served as circuit justice for the Fourth Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit from June 26, 1946, until his death on September 8, 1953.

In his time on the Supreme Court, he wrote 77 opinions for the court and 13 dissents. His most dramatic dissent was when the court voided President Truman&#x27;s seizure of the steel industry during a strike in a June 3, 1952, decision, &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;. His final public appearance at the court was when he read the decision not to review the conviction and death sentence of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. After Justice William O. Douglas granted a stay of execution to the Rosenbergs at the last moment, Chief Justice Vinson sent special flights out to bring vacationing justices back to Washington in order to ensure the execution of the Rosenbergs. During his tenure as Chief Justice, one of his law clerks was future Associate Justice Byron White

The major issues his court dealt with included racial segregation, labor unions, communism and loyalty oaths. On racial segregation, he wrote that states practicing the separate but equal doctrine must provide facilities that were truly equal, in &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot; and &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;. The case of &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot; was before the Court at the time of his death. Vinson, not wanting a 5–4 decision, had ordered a second hearing of the case. He died before the case could be reheard, and his vote may have been pivotal. Upon his death, Earl Warren was appointed to the Court and the case was heard again.

When Secretary of State Dean Acheson came under fire from congressional Republicans for being &quot;soft on communism&quot; at the end of 1950 Vinson was briefly mentioned as the possible replacement as Secretary of State, which would have required his resignation from the court. This, however, did not come about.

As Chief Justice, Vinson swore in Truman (in 1949) and Dwight D. Eisenhower (in 1953) as President.

==Death and legacy==
Vinson died on September 8, 1953, of a heart attack at his Washington home. His body was interred in Pinehill Cemetery in Louisa, Kentucky.

An extensive collection of Vinson&#x27;s personal and judicial papers is archived at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, where they are available for research.

A portrait of Vinson hangs in the hallway of the chapter house of the Kentucky Alpha-Delta chapter of Phi Delta Theta (ΦΔΘ) international fraternity, at Centre College. Vinson was a member of the chapter in his years at Centre. Affectionately known as &quot;Dead Fred&quot;, the portrait is taken by fraternity members to Centre football and basketball games and other events.

The Fred M. Vinson Birthplace, in Louisa, Kentucky, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>David Gamkrelidze or Davit Gamqrelidze (; born April 2, 1964, in Tbilisi) is a Georgian politician, leader of the New Rights Party of Georgia, Member of Parliament since 1999, member of committee for defense and security, and Chairman of the Centre-Right Opposition Group in the Parliament of Georgia. He also contested the 2008 Georgian presidential election and came fourth with the 4.02% of the votes cast.

==Early life and education==

David Gamkrelidze was born on April 2, 1964, in a family of geologists, academicians of Georgia’s Academy of Sciences, and Georgian Geological School representative Erekle Gamkrelidze and of Ia Gobronidze. His grandfather, Petre Gamkrelidze, was one of the founders of the Georgian Geological School.

Gamkrelidze graduated from the Tbilisi 55th secondary school. In 1982 he became a student of Tbilisi State Medical University, Faculty of Pediatrics. He was a holder of Tarkhnishvili Scholarship, member of the Student’s Medical Council, and frequent participant of various students’ international conferences and Olympiads.

In 1988 Gamkrelidze, along with his friends, established the Christian-Democratic Association, which was later renamed the Christian-Democratic Union.He took active part in the March–April 1989 protests against the Soviet Army. After the April 9 tragedy, Gamkrelidze joined the newly established Rustaveli Society.

In the spring of 1989, with the purpose of coordinating the National Liberation Movement, the National Forum was established. The Christian-Democratic Union was represented at the Forum by David Gamkrelidze and Irakli Kakabadze. In June of the same year, the first delegation of the National Liberation Movement traveled to Paris to celebrate the Independence Day of Georgia at the invitation of the Georgian Diaspora living there. Gamkrelidze was a member of the delegation as well.

==Entrepreneurship==

After the collapse of the Communist regime in 1990 and Georgia’s eventual re-gaining of independence, Gamkrelidze concluded he had exhausted his function in the National Liberation Movement and moved to entrepreneurial activities. He and his friends established the first ever insurance company in Georgia, the Aldagi. Very soon, Aldagi became the flagman of the insurance industry in Georgia. In 1999, Gamkrelidze, as the President of Aldagi, was named among the ten most successful businessmen of Georgia.

==Political activity==

In 1998 he was elected member of the Tbilisi City Assembly, local governing authority of the capital of Georgia.

For the then ruling party (Citizens’ Union of Georgia), in order to win the general elections badly needed a certain number of successful people in its electoral party list. David Gamkrelidze, who did not hold the membership of this party, agreed to take part in the elections along with other businessmen .

On October 31, 1999, Gamkrelidze became a member of the Parliament of Georgia. At the first session sitting, he got elected as chairman of the Healthcare and Social Issues Committee. Gradually, David Gamkrelidze and his friends realized that the ruling party did not actually care for their professionalism and commitment to the matters of national importance. The period of disenchantment began, which reached its peak in the spring of 2000. That was right after the ruling party presented to the Parliament the budget for ratification in 1999 and demanded from the majority of the party to endorse it.

David Gamkrelidze and Levan Gachechiladze resigned in sign of protest and called for creation of a committee that would investigate the budget deficit of 1999.

On May 17, 2000, a special commission was formed with David Gamkrelidze at the chairmanship to investigate the budget deficit of 1999. In six months, David Gamkrelidze presented to the Parliament a conclusion and said the whole truth as to what the reason for the 1999 drastic budget deficit in actuality was.

On September 8, 2000, with the purpose to overcome the critical situation prevalent in the country and in order to raise public awareness in this regard, 35 professionals established a public organization – the “New Movement”. David Gamkrelidze was one of its founders and an active member.
On September 17, 2000, the “New Faction” Group was formed in the Parliament. David Gamkrelidze was elected chairman of the group.
The “New Faction”, despite its smallness, significantly changed the situation in the Parliament. It truly said a totally different and new word in Georgia’s politics.

==New Rights party==
On June 15, 2001, on the basis of the “New Faction”, New Movement and Georgian Neo-Conservative Party, a political party was created. The party was called the New Rights of Georgia. The founding congress elected David Gamkrelidze as its co-chairman.

Within the year after its founding, the New Rights reached high results. On June 2, 2002, the New Rights won the first place in the local elections all across Georgia, and the third place on Tbilisi level. Gamkrelidze personally headed the party’s election campaign. After winning the local elections, the party began to prepare for the upcoming parliamentary elections.

In September, 2002 Gamkrelidze and his colleagues submitted to the Parliament of Georgia a decree regarding Georgia’s accession to NATO as a foreign policy priority, and the declaration was unanimously adopted. This was the first open statement about Georgia’s willingness to join NATO.

On June 27, 2003, at the Party 2nd Congress Gamkrelidze was unanimously elected as chairman and leader.

During the Rose Revolution, the results of the parliamentary elections of November 2, 2003, in which the New Rights overcame the 7-percent threshold, were abolished, and new general elections were called. Gamkrelidze was in charge of the Industrial’s and New Right’s election campaign for the March 28, 2004 elections. From the so-called non-revolutionary parties, only the New Rights and their coalition with another party of centre-right orientation, the Industrials, were able to overcome the 7-percent threshold. 

In April, 2004 Gamkrelidze became member of the Parliament second time.

He headed the Right Opposition Group and was a member of the Defense and Security Committee, as well as a member of the Delegation to NATO Parliamentary Assembly. 

On June 3, 2006, Gamkrelidze was re-elected as the New Rights Party chairman at the 3rd Party Congress.

On December 23, 2019, the New Rights party merged with Mamuka Khazaradze&#x27;s Lelo and Davit Usupashvili&#x27;s Development Movement to form a new political union called Lelo for Georgia. The inaugural congress was held on December 22, where Mamuka Khazaradze was elected chairman, Badri Japaridze as secretary general, and Davit Usupashvili as chairman of the political council.

==January 2008 presidential elections==
On November 24, 2007, on the 4th Extraordinary Congress of the New Rights Party, Gamkrelidze was nominated as a candidate for early Presidential elections to be held on January 5, 2008. His candidature officially supported by four political parties (New Rights Party, Industrialists, National Democrats and Christian Democrats). He advocates the establishment of a constitutional monarchy through a referendum.

== 2024 parliamentary elections ==
On August 15, 2024, the coalition Strong Georgia officially opened its election headquarters, led by Davit Gamkrelidze.

During the opening ceremony, Mamuka Khazaradze, the leader of Strong Georgia, shared his excitement about the platform&#x27;s growth and announced the relocation to the new headquarters. Khazaradze praised Gamkrelidze as a long-time friend and a dedicated professional, highlighting his consistent support and leadership in critical times. He expressed gratitude to Gamkrelidze for taking on the role of leading the election staff and welcomed him to the team.

However, Gamkrelidze clarified that this role does not mark his return to politics. &quot;I am not planning to become an MP or continue my political career. My involvement will be limited to leading the team during these critical times,&quot; Gamkrelidze explained.

==Family==
David Gamkrelidze has a wife, Marina Madichi, and two children, Erekle and Nino.

He speaks Georgian, Russian and English.

<doc id="573972" wikidata="Q256864" url="?curid=573972" title="Hosokawa Gracia">
<text>&#x27;, usually referred to as &#x27;, (1563 – 25 August 1600) was a member of the aristocratic Akechi family from the Sengoku period. Gracia is best known for her role in the Battle of Sekigahara; Ishida Mitsunari attempted to take her hostage to sway her husband, Hosokawa Tadaoki, into joining his side on the battle. She refused to commit suicide because of her Catholic faith, breaking the code of conduct imposed on women of the samurai class and causing a family retainer to kill her instead.

She was the daughter of Akechi Mitsuhide and Tsumaki Hiroko, the wife of Hosokawa Tadaoki, and a convert to Catholicism. As the last notable survivor of the Akechi clan, the clan that planned and executed the assassination of Oda Nobunaga, the first &quot;Great Unifier&quot; of Japan, Gracia&#x27;s death affected both armies. The incident did much damage to Ishida&#x27;s reputation, which greatly reduced his chances of recruiting more allies, some of whom were also secretly Christians.

==Biography==
She was named Akechi Tama or Tamako at birth; Garasha, the name by which she is known in history, is based upon her Catholic baptismal name, Gracia.

She married Hosokawa Tadaoki at the age of sixteen; the couple had five or six children. In the Sixth Month of 1582, her father Akechi Mitsuhide betrayed and killed his lord, Oda Nobunaga, making the teenage Tama a traitor&#x27;s daughter. Not wishing to divorce her, Tadaoki sent her to the hamlet of Midono in the mountains of the Tango Peninsula (now in Kyoto Prefecture), where she remained hidden until 1584, until Toyotomi Hideyoshi requested that Tadaoki bring Tama to the Hosokawa mansion in Osaka, where she remained in confinement.

Tama&#x27;s maid, Kiyohara Kayo, baptized Maria, was from a Catholic family, and her husband repeated to her conversations with his Christian friend Takayama Ukon. In the spring of 1587 Tama managed to secretly visit the Osaka church; a few months later, when she heard that Toyotomi Hideyoshi had issued a proclamation against Christianity, she was determined to be baptized immediately. As she could not leave the house, she was baptized by her maid and received the Christian name &quot;Gracia&quot;. She is said to have studied both Latin and Portuguese and to have read and become fascinated with Thomas à Kempis&#x27; &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;.

In 1595, Tadaoki&#x27;s life was in danger because of his friendship with Toyotomi Hidetsugu, and he told Gracia that if he should die she must kill herself. When she wrote asking the priests about the plan, they informed her that suicide was a grave sin. However, the danger passed.

The death of Hideyoshi in 1598 left a power vacuum with two rival factions forming: Tokugawa Ieyasu in the east and Ishida Mitsunari in the west. When Ieyasu went to the east in 1600 leading a large army, including Tadaoki, his rival Ishida took over the impregnable castle in Osaka, the city where the families of many of Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals resided. Ishida devised a plan to take the family members hostage, thus forcing the rival generals either to ally with him or at least not to attack him.

However, when Ishida attempted to take Gracia hostage, the family retainer Ogasawara Shōsai killed her and then committed seppuku after lighting the mansion on fire. The outrage over her death was so great that Ishida was forced to abandon his plans. Most Japanese accounts state that it was Gracia&#x27;s idea to order Ogasawara to kill her. However, these accounts were written many decades after the actual death of Gracia. The original Jesuit account written shortly after her death instead states Tadaoki had commanded the servants of his household to kill Gracia if her honor were ever in danger. The servants had seen the attempted kidnapping as such, and acted on this order.

A Catholic priest, Gnecchi-Soldo Organtino, had Gracia&#x27;s remains gathered from the Hosokawa mansion and buried them in a cemetery in Sakai. Later, her remains were moved to Sōzenji, a temple in Osaka. Gracia also shares a grave with Tadaoki at Kōtō-in, a sub-temple of Daitoku-ji.

Gracia is an ancestor of former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa.

==In historical fiction==
Gracia frequently appears as a character in Japanese historical fiction, both novels and drama. One website lists her as a character in over 40 stage dramas, movies, TV dramas, etc., from 1887 to 2006. She is also frequently referred to in popular writing or talks on the history of the period. Ayako Miura&#x27;s novel &quot;Hosokawa Garasha Fujin&quot; (English title: &quot;Lady Gracia: a Samurai Wife&#x27;s Love, Strife and Faith&quot;) follows history fairly closely.

James Clavell used Gracia as the model for the character of Mariko Toda in his novel &quot;Shōgun&quot;. Additionally Clavell gave the Japanese wife of Vasco Rodrigues (whose Japanese name was Nyan-nyan) the baptismal name Gracia. This book was later adapted for television as a miniseries in 1980 where Mariko was portrayed by Japanese actress Yoko Shimada, who had previously portrayed Gracia in the 1978 Japanese Taiga Drama series Ōgon no Hibi. Elements of Mariko&#x27;s story follow Gracia&#x27;s quite closely, although the manner of her death is different (Mariko threatens to commit suicide if she is not allowed to leave Osaka Castle and is then killed in a raid on her compound, thereby her death served the original purpose as her threatened suicide, enraging the other hostages) and the two characters do not fundamentally have anything in common. In the 2024 miniseries, Toda Mariko is played by Anna Sawai.

==In music==
*&quot;Mulier fortis cuius pretium de ultimis finibus sive Gratia Regni Tango Regina exantlatis pro Christo aerumnis clara&quot; was composed by the Austrian composer Johann Bernhard Staudt in 1698.
*&quot;Hosokawa Grazia&quot; is a lyric opera in three acts, the first written in Japanese language. It was composed by the Italian missioner and musician don Vincent Cimatti. Represented as a lyric drama in words and songs in 1940, it was then written completely in music and played in the years 1960, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1989, 2004.

==Modern references==
Gracia appears as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot; series starting on &quot;Samurai Warriors 2 Xtreme Legends&quot;. She is also playable in &quot;Warriors Orochi 3&quot;. She is a playable character in the post-credit story mode of &quot;Pokémon Conquest&quot; (&quot;Pokémon + Nobunaga&#x27;s Ambition&quot; in Japan), with her partner Pokémon being Musharna and Gothitelle. 

The city of Nagaokakyō, Kyoto hosts the Garasha Festival every November.

She appears as an event final boss in the browser game &quot;Touken Ranbu&quot;. She is also a prominent figure in the &quot;&quot; play &quot;Kiden: Ikusayu no Adabana&quot;, and makes an appearance in the spin-off Video Game &quot;Touken Ranbu Warriors&quot;.

<doc id="573973" wikidata="Q1373925" url="?curid=573973" title="Flat-file database">
<text>A flat-file database is a database stored in a file called a flat file. Records follow a uniform format, and there are no structures for indexing or recognizing relationships between records. The file is simple. A flat file can be a plain text file (e.g. csv, txt or tsv), or a binary file. Relationships can be inferred from the data in the database, but the database format itself does not make those relationships explicit.

The term has generally implied a small database, but very large databases can also be flat.

==Overview==

Plain text files usually contain one record per line.

Examples of flat files include codice_1 and codice_2 on Unix-like operating systems. Another example of a flat file is a name-and-address list with the fields &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Address&quot; and &quot;Phone Number&quot;.

Flat files are typically either delimiter-separated or fixed-width.

=== Delimiter-separated values ===

In delimiter-separated values files, the fields are separated by a character or string called the delimiter.
Common variants are comma-separated values (CSV) where the delimiter is a comma, tab-separated values (TSV) where the delimiter is the tab character), space-separated values and vertical-bar-separated values (delimiter is codice_3).

If the delimiter is allowed inside a field, there needs to be a way to distinguish delimiters characters or strings that are meant literally. For example, consider the sentence &quot;If I have to, I&#x27;ll do it myself.&quot;. To encode it in CSV, there needs to be a way to prevent the comma from splitting the field. Several strategies to prevent delimiter collision exist.

=== Fixed-width formats ===

With fixed-width formats, each field has a fixed length with extra spaces added as needed. The fixed lengths can be predefined and known ahead of time (i.e. stated in the format&#x27;s specification), or parsed from a header.

With predefined lengths, fields are limited to a maximum length. The need for longer fields may appear sometime after the format is defined. Possible workarounds include abbreviating phrases, replacing values with links (e.g. a URI pointing to the value), and splitting a file into multiple files.

With delimiter-separated formats, determining the field boundaries requires finding the delimiters, which incurs some computational overhead. This is not needed for fixed-width formats. However, fixed-width formats can lead to unnecessarily large file sizes if fields tend to be shorter than the lengths reserved for them.

=== Declarative notation ===

Delimiters can be used alongside a notation stating the length of each field. For example, codice_4 specifies the length (5 and 9) of each field. This is called declarative notation. It has low overhead and trivially avoids delimiter collisions, but it is brittle when edited manually.

==History==

Herman Hollerith&#x27;s work for the US Census Bureau first exercised in the 1890 United States census, involving data tabulated via hole punches in paper cards, is sometimes considered the first computerized flat-file database, as it included no cards indexing other cards, or otherwise relating the individual cards to one another, save by their group membership.

In the 1980s, configurable flat-file database computer applications were popular on the IBM PC and the Macintosh. These programs were designed to make it easy for individuals to design and use their own databases, and were almost on par with word processors and spreadsheets in popularity. Examples of flat-file database software include early versions of FileMaker and the shareware PC-File and the popular dBase.

Flat-file databases are common and ubiquitous because they are easy to write and edit, and suit myriad purposes in an uncomplicated way.

===Modern implementations===

Linear stores of NoSQL data, JSON data, primitive spreadsheets (perhaps comma-separated or tab-delimited), and text files can all be seen as flat-file databases because they lack integrated indexes, built-in references between data elements, and complex data types. Programs to manage collections of books or appointments and address books may use single-purpose flat-file databases, storing and retrieving information from flat files unadorned with indexes or pointing systems.

While a user can write a table of contents into a text file, the text file format itself does not include a concept of a table of contents. While a user may write &quot;friends with Kathy&quot; in the &quot;Notes&quot; section for John&#x27;s contact information, this is interpreted by the user rather than a built-in feature of the database. When a database system begins to recognize and codify relationships between records, it begins to drift away from being &quot;flat,&quot; and when it has a detailed system for describing types and hierarchical relationships, it is now too structured to be considered &quot;flat.&quot;

==Example database==
The following example illustrates typical elements of a flat-file database. The data arrangement consists of a series of columns and rows organized into a tabular format. This specific example uses only one table.

The columns include: &quot;name&quot; (a person&#x27;s name, second column); &quot;team&quot; (the name of an athletic team supported by the person, third column); and a numeric &quot;unique ID&quot;, (used to uniquely identify records, first column).

Here is an example textual representation of the described data:

 id name team
 1 Amy Blues
 2 Bob Reds
 3 Chuck Blues
 4 Richard Blues
 5 Ethel Reds
 6 Fred Blues
 7 Gilly Blues
 8 Hank Reds
 9 Hank Blues

This type of data representation is quite standard for a flat-file database, although there are some additional considerations that are not readily apparent from the text:
* Data types: each column in a database table such as the one above is ordinarily restricted to a specific data type. Such restrictions are usually established by convention, but not formally indicated unless the data is transferred to a relational database system.
* Separated columns: In the above example, individual columns are separated using whitespace characters. This is also called indentation or &quot;fixed-width&quot; data formatting. Another common convention is to separate columns using one or more delimiter characters, such as a tab or comma.
* Relational algebra: Each row or record in the above table meets the standard definition of a tuple under relational algebra (the above example depicts a series of 3-tuples). Additionally, the first row specifies the field names that are associated with the values of each row.
* Database management system: Since the formal operations possible with a text file are usually more limited than desired, the text in the above example would ordinarily represent an intermediary state of the data prior to being transferred into a database management system.

<text>Hermanfrid (also Hermanifrid or Hermanafrid; , died 532) was the last independent king of the Thuringii in present-day Germany. He was one of three sons of King Bisinus and his Lombard queen Menia. His siblings were Baderic; Raicunda, married to the Lombard king Wacho; and Bertachar.

==Biography==
Between 507 and 511 Hermanfrid married Amalaberga, daughter of Amalafrida who was the daughter of Theodemir. Amalberga was the niece of Theodoric the Great, who received a number of &quot;silver-white&quot; horses from Hermanfrid. 
It is unclear when Hermanfrid became king, but he is called king (&quot;rex thoringorum&quot;) in a letter by Theodoric dated to 507. He first shared the rule with his brothers Baderic and Bertachar, but later killed Bertachar in a battle in 529, leaving the young Radegund an orphan.

According to Gregory of Tours, Amalaberga now stirred up Hermanfrid against his remaining brother. Once she laid out only half the table for a meal, and when questioned about the reason, she told him &quot;A king who owns only of half of his kingdom deserved to have half of his table bare.&quot; Thus roused, Hermanfrid made a pact with the king of Metz, Theuderic I, to march against Baderic. Baderic was overcome by the Franks and beheaded, but Hermanfrid refused to fulfill his obligations to Theuderic, which led to enmity between the two kings.

In 531 or 532, Theuderic, his son Theudebert I, and his brother King Clotaire I of Soissons attacked the Thuringii. The Franks won a battle near the river Unstrut and took the royal seat at Scithingi (modern Burgscheidungen). Hermanfrid managed to flee, but the Franks captured his niece Radegund (see Venantius Fortunatus, &quot;De excidio Thoringae&quot;) and his nephews.

Theuderic gave Hermanfrid safe conduct, ordered him to come to Zülpich, and gave him many gifts. While Hermanfrid talked with Theuderic, somebody pushed him from the town walls of Zülpich and he died. Gregory mentions that certain people had ventured to suggest that Theuderic &quot;might&quot; have had something to do with it.

Radegund was then forced to marry King Clotaire, while Hermanfrid&#x27;s wife Amalaberga fled to the Ostrogoths with her children Amalafrid and Rodelinda. She was later captured by the Byzantine general Belisarius and sent to Constantinople, where Amalafrid later became an imperial general and Rodelinda was married to the Lombard king Auduin.

The Thuringian kingdom ended with Hermanfrid. The area east of the Saale River was taken over by Slavic tribes, north Thuringia by the Saxons.

The fall of the Thuringian dynasty became the subject of numerous epic treatments, the best known of which is in the &quot;Rerum gestarum saxonicarum libri tres&quot; by Widukind of Corvey, a Saxon foundation myth written in 967. Rudolph of Fulda tells a related story. In this version, it is the Saxons under Duke Hadugato, as allies of the Franks, who win the great battle on the Unstrut.

==About the sources==
The main source for this period is Gregory of Tours, who represents the Frankish viewpoint.
Widukind is much later and has clearly incorporated mythical elements into his account. Procopius only mentions the events in passing as far as they affect Italy.

<doc id="573979" wikidata="Q2916251" url="?curid=573979" title="Small claims court">
<text>Small-claims courts have limited jurisdiction to hear civil cases between private litigants. Courts authorized to try small claims may also have other judicial functions, and go by different names in different jurisdictions. For example, it may be known as a county or magistrate&#x27;s court. These courts can be found in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Greece,
New Zealand, Philippines, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Nigeria and the United States.

==Purpose and operation==
The jurisdiction of small-claims courts typically encompasses private disputes that do not involve large amounts of money. The routine collection of small debts forms a large portion of the cases brought to small-claims courts, as well as evictions and other disputes between landlords and tenants, unless the jurisdiction is already covered by a tenancy board.

A small-claims court generally has a maximum monetary limit to the amount of judgments it can award, often in the thousands of dollars/pounds. By suing in a small-claims court, the plaintiff typically waives any right to claim more than the court can award. The plaintiff may or may not be allowed to reduce a claim to fit the requirements of this venue. &#x27;Court shopping&#x27;—where a plaintiff reduces the damage claim amount to have a trial in a court that otherwise does not have jurisdiction—is strictly forbidden in some states. For example, if a plaintiff asserts damages of $30,000 in hopes of winning an award of $25,000 in small-claims court, the court dismisses the case because the court does not have jurisdiction to hear cases in which asserted damages exceed the court&#x27;s maximum amount.

Thus, even if the plaintiff is willing to accept less than the full amount, the case cannot be brought to small-claims court. To bring the case to small-claims court, the plaintiff must prove that actual damages are within the court&#x27;s jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, a party who loses in a small-claims court is entitled to a trial &quot;de novo&quot; in a court of more general jurisdiction and with more formal procedures.

The rules of civil procedure, and sometimes of evidence, are typically altered and simplified to make the procedures economical. A usual guiding principle in these courts is that individuals ought to be able to conduct their own cases and represent themselves without a lawyer. Rules are relaxed but still apply to some degree. In some jurisdictions, corporations must still be represented by a lawyer in small-claims court. Expensive court procedures such as interrogatories and depositions are usually not allowed in small-claims court, and practically all matters filed in small-claims court are set for trial. Under some court rules, should the defendant not show up at trial and not have requested a postponement, a default judgment may be entered in favour of the plaintiff.

Trial by jury is seldom or never conducted in small-claims courts; it is typically excluded by the statute establishing the court. Similarly, equitable remedies such as injunctions, including protective orders, are seldom available from small-claims courts.

Separate family courts may exist to hear simple cases in family law. For reasons having more to do with history than with the sort of case typically heard by a small-claims court, most US states do not allow domestic relations disputes in small-claims court.

Winning in small-claims court does not automatically ensure payment in recompense of a plaintiff&#x27;s damages. This may be relatively easy, in the case of a dispute against an insured party, or extremely difficult, in the case of an uncooperative, transient, or indigent defendant. The judgment may be collected through wage garnishment and liens.

Most courts encourage parties with disputes to seek alternative dispute resolution, if possible, before filing suit. For example, the Superior Court of California, Santa Clara provides guidelines for resolving disputes out of court. Both parties can agree on arbitration by a third party to settle their dispute outside of court.

==History==

 The Mayor&#x27;s and City of London Court is the successor to the several medieval courts in the City of London, one being the Court of Conscience for recovery of small debts. This was a type of equity court. A similar Court of Conscience was established by charter in some ancient boroughs in Ireland; this was emulated in others, without legal sanction until regularised by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840.

==By region==

===Australia===
Small claims are handled differently by each state and territory, with most relying on tribunals while others have a minor claims division of their respective magistrates court:
* Australian Capital Territory: ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal has jurisdiction over civil disputes involving amounts up to $25,000
* New South Wales: The Small Claims Division of the Local Court of New South Wales hears civil claims up to $20,000, while the General Division hears civil disputes between $20,000 and $100,000 in value.
* Northern Territory: Northern Territory Civil and Administrative Tribunal has jurisdiction over small claims, which involve amounts up to $25,000
* Queensland: Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal deals with minor civil disputes, which involve amounts up to $25,000
* South Australia: Magistrates Court of South Australia hears a minor claim, which is up to $25,000 in value
* Victoria: Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal
* Western Australia: Magistrates Court of Western Australia hears a minor case, which involves a claim up to $10,000

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the justices of the peace (, , ) function as the small claims courts in the country&#x27;s judicial system; they stand at the bottom of the Belgian judicial hierarchy and only handle civil cases. There is a justice of the peace in each judicial canton of Belgium, of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the matters over which another court or tribunal has exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the justices of the peace have original jurisdiction over a number of matters irrespective of the disputed amount, such as cases involving the renting or leasing of real estate, evictions, easement, land consolidation, consumer credit or unpaid utility bills. The justices of the peace also have original jurisdiction in certain aspects of family law, most notably legal guardianships for incapacitated seniors, and the involuntary commitment of the mentally ill to psychiatric facilities. The judgments made by the justices of the peace can, with some exceptions, be appealed to the tribunals of first instance.

===Brazil===
Small claim courts in Brazil were established by Law No. 9,099/1995 and Article One of such law states that they shall be organized by both Federal Judiciary and State Judiciary. Therefore, there are Federal Small Claim Courts (single noun &quot;Juizado Especial Federal&quot;), as well as Small Claim Courts that are part of a state&#x27;s judiciary structure. The Small Claim Courts that belong to a State&#x27;s Judiciary are subdivided into two types of courts: the Special Civil Court (&quot;Juizado Especial Cível&quot;, shortened as JEC) and the Special Criminal Court (&quot;Juizado Especial Criminal&quot;, shortened as Jecrim). Under Article Three of Law No. 9,099/1995, Civil Claims involving an amount up to 40 (forty) monthly minimal wages or R$24,880.00 (October 2012), which correspond to roughly US$12,440.00, may be filed before a Special Civil Court, as well as small claims involving landlords and some claims set by Article 275, II, of the Code of Civil Procedure. Special Criminal Courts, on the other hand, may process claims involving small criminal offences, which, under Article 60 of Law No. 9,099/1995 are those either set by the Contraventions Law (Decree No. 3,688/1941) or those where the penalty does not surpass 02 (two years). As per Article 54, there are no court fees for the Small Claim Courts. However, if an appeal is filed, court fees shall be applied.

===Canada===
All provinces have procedures for small claims in Canada. In general, there are two different models. In most provinces, including British Columbia, Alberta, and New Brunswick, small-claims courts operate independently of the superior courts. In other jurisdictions, the small-claims court is a branch or division of the superior court. In Ontario, the Small-Claims Court is a branch of the Superior Court of Justice, and in Manitoba, the Small-Claims Court is under the jurisdiction of the Court of the King&#x27;s Bench.

Small-claims cases are heard by judges of the Provincial Court in British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, by judges or deputy judges of the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario, and by Hearing Officers in Manitoba.

Small-claims courts are meant to provide an easier and less expensive path to resolve disputes than the higher courts. Small-claims court procedure is regulated both by provincial legislation and rules in most provinces. The small-claims procedure is simplified with no strict pleadings requirements and no formal discovery process, and parties&#x27; costs may be limited.

Monetary limits for small-claims courts in Canada vary by province:
In general, disputes involving title to land, slander, libel, bankruptcy, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution must be handled in a superior court and cannot be determined in small-claims courts.

===European Union===
A European Small Claims Procedure for cross-border claims under the Brussels regime as an alternative to national procedures was established on 1 January 2009, processing claims with values up to 2,000 EUR, increased to 5,000€ on 14 July 2017 and current 

===Hong Kong===
The Small Claims Tribunal (Chinese: 小額錢債審裁處) was established to provide a procedure for the speedy and inexpensive resolution of small claims. Situated at the West Kowloon Law Courts Building, the Small Claims Tribunal deals with monetary claims not exceeding HK$75,000. It has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with such claims. The Small Claims Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with labour disputes, possession of land, alimony maintenance, libel/defamation claims and claims made by money lenders. As the Small Claims Tribunal does not have the power to grant injunctive relief, if a claimant seeks such relief, the case will be transferred to the District Court.

The Chief Magistrate (currently Victor So Wai-tak) is the Court Leader of the Small Claims Tribunal and is responsible for the administration of the Tribunal.

Cases in the Small Claims Tribunal are heard by Adjudicators (Chinese: 審裁官) appointed by the Chief Executive on the recommendation of the independent Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission (JORC). Cases may also be heard by Deputy Adjudicators (Chinese: 暫委審裁官) appointed on a temporary basis by the Chief Justice. A person who has practised for at least 5 years as a barrister, advocate, solicitor or judicial officer in Hong Kong or another common law jurisdiction is eligible to be appointed as an Adjudicator or Deputy Adjudicator. In practice, a number of Permanent Magistrates are assigned to sit as Adjudicators in the Small Claims Tribunal.

The fee to file a claim in the Small Claims Tribunal varies between HK$20 and HK$120 depending on the amount claimed.

When a claim is filed at the Tribunal Registry, the claimant will be given Form 3 which states the date of the call-over hearing (which must take place no later than 60 days after the claim is filed). At the call-over hearing, the Tribunal Officer will interview both parties, identify the issues in dispute and explore if a settlement can be reached. If the dispute cannot be settled, the Tribunal Officer will give directions for the filing of further documents (defence, counterclaim, reply, witness statements, other supporting documents etc.) and will adjourn the case until another date for a mention hearing.

At the mention hearing, the Adjudicator will check if the parties have complied with the previous directions and may also give further directions in preparation for trial. The Adjudicator may also actively explore with parties if they are willing to settle. If a settlement cannot be reached and the case is ready for trial, the Adjudicator will fix a trial date.

A party may apply to the Tribunal for adjournment of a hearing date. However, as the aim of the Small Claims Tribunal is to handle and dispose of disputes within a reasonable time, the Tribunal will generally only allow an application for adjournment if it is supported by a good reason and if it is a short adjournment. The Tribunal is expected to manage cases actively.

Hearings in the Small Claims Tribunal are conducted in an informal manner. Parties act in person and are not permitted to be legally represented. The rationale is that small claims should be resolved without incurring substantial expenses in retaining legal services and also that an unrepresented litigant should not fear the imbalance of power caused by a lawyer representing the other side. This ensures that there is a level playing field for all parties. However, a party is permitted to consult a lawyer for advice, including a lawyer who is present in the courtroom during the hearing as an observer, as long as the lawyer does not effectively conduct the case by giving directions to the party on steps to take during the hearing and questions to ask the witnesses. If a party is a corporation and one of its employees is a lawyer, that employee is allowed to represent the corporation in the proceedings in the Small Claims Tribunal. A party may also apply to the Small Claims Tribunal for leave for another person (who is not a lawyer) to act as their representative in conducting the case.

The claimant bears the burden of proof and has the primary responsibility to prepare and produce evidence in support of their case. However, the Adjudicator is under a statutory obligation to inquire into any matter considered relevant to a claim, whether or not it has been raised by a party. The Adjudicator may therefore invite the parties to comment on matters or direct them to produce evidence or documents relating to matters considered to be important. As the Adjudicator has an &#x27;active inquisitorial role&#x27;, the adjudicator should direct the parties to produce specific documents/evidence if such documents/evidence would have a bearing on the legal analysis of the dispute. The Adjudicator is not under a duty to summon witnesses to fill in the gaps in the evidence/case put forward by a party, but if a witness who may be important has not been called by a party and the Adjudicator has not explained to the parties the potential significance of that witness, the Adjudicator should not solely rely on the failure to call that witness to disbelieve a party&#x27;s case. The Adjudicator may put questions to the parties and witnesses, and invite the parties to make submissions. However, the duty to inquire does not mean that the Adjudicator should take over the role of an adviser or advocate for a party, as the Adjudicator must remain neutral and impartial.

Rules of evidence do not apply in the Small Claims Tribunal, which may receive any evidence that it considers to be relevant. The Small Claims Tribunal will decide how to receive evidence based on considerations of proportionality, costs and common sense. A party may request discovery of documents from the other party if such documents exist, are/were in that party&#x27;s possession, are relevant to the dispute and are necessary to obtain to deal fairly with the dispute between the parties. The Small Claims Tribunal can receive hearsay evidence, but it should consider why the witness concerned is not called to give oral evidence and whether the hearsay evidence is credible.

The Small Claims Tribunal has a discretion to award to the successful party any reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by and any loss of salary or wages suffered in attending the hearings. The costs order is not meant to be punitive.

The Adjudicator will give the decision orally or in writing at the end of the trial or as soon as possible thereafter. If the decision is delivered orally, the Adjudicator is required to reduce it to writing within 14 days. When reducing the oral decision in writing, the Adjudicator may expand on the oral decision by giving fuller written reasons for judgment as long as they are consistent with the original determination and factual findings. The Adjudicator is under a duty to analyse the material points in the evidence of the case and to give reasons as to why a particular conclusion or decision has been reached. The Adjudicator should explain their belief or disbelief in the evidence given by a witness. The Adjudicator should not give further written reasons to perfect or improve on the written reasons for decision which have already been given, in particular after one party has made an application to the Court of First Instance of the High Court for leave to appeal.

After the Adjudicator has delivered the decision/order, a party may request within 7 days by filing Form 8C and paying a fee of HK$61 that the adjudicator review the decision. When conducting the review of the decision/order, the Adjudicator may re-open and re-hear the claim wholly or in part, may call or hear fresh evidence, and may accordingly confirm, vary or reverse the decision/order. Parties wishing to adduce new evidence at the review stage are required to give cogent reasons explaining why such evidence had not been adduced at trial and show that such evidence is material/relevant to the dispute. The Adjudicator is required to give adequate reasons for the review decision.

Regardless of whether the Adjudicator has conducted a review of the decision/order, a party may appeal to the Court of First Instance of the High Court against a decision/order of the Small Claims Tribunal. However, it is necessary first to apply for leave to appeal from the Court of First Instance by filing Form 9 and paying a fee of HK$61 within 7 working days of the Small Claim Tribunal&#x27;s decision/order by showing that it involves a point of law that is arguable or exceeded the Tribunal&#x27;s jurisdiction. When applying for leave to appeal, a party may be legally represented in the Court of First Instance. The leave to appeal application will be heard before a High Court Judge at an &quot;ex parte&quot; oral hearing, which is attended only by the party applying for leave to appeal and not the other party/parties. Instead of an oral hearing, regardless of whether the applicant is legally represented or acting in person, the High Court Judge may direct that the &quot;ex parte&quot; application for leave to appeal be determined by way of paper disposal (in which case, the applicant files written submissions and the Judge hands down a decision at a later date). If the Court of First Instance refuses to grant leave to appeal, its decision is final and not susceptible to further appeal. The &quot;ex parte&quot; leave to appeal procedure means that the successful party in the Small Claims Tribunal only has to spend time and incur costs in resisting an appeal if the other party has been able to persuade the High Court Judge that he/she has an arguable ground of appeal. However, in some cases, the High Court Judge may direct that the leave to appeal hearing take place &quot;inter partes&quot; (in the presence of all the parties, not just the applicant).

If leave to appeal is granted, the appellant should file a Notice of Originating Motion and pay a fee of HK$1,045. All the parties (who may be legally represented) will then attend the appeal hearing before a High Court Judge. The Court of First Instance is not bound to allow the appeal merely because there was a misdirection or improper admission or rejection of evidence by the Small Claims Tribunal, unless the Court is of the view that substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned. If the appeal is allowed, and if the appellant is legally represented while the respondent acts in person as he/she cannot afford legal representation, the Court has a discretion not to order that the unsuccessful respondent pay the costs incurred by the successful appellant in bringing the appeal if it would cause &#x27;undue hardship&#x27; to the unsuccessful respondent and if the respondent had not put forward a claim or a defence in bad faith and had not misbehaved in conducting the proceedings in the Small Claims Tribunal. In principle, if the appeal is allowed, the Court of First Instance will remit the case back to the Small Claims Tribunal for a re-trial if it is necessary to make new/further factual findings, even if the amount claimed is small. However, the Court of First Instance may decline to order a re-trial even if it considers that the Small Claims Tribunal made an error of law if it would be disproportionate bearing in mind the amount claimed.

===Ireland===
The &quot;small claims court&quot; is an informal name for the District Court when operating under its Small Claims Procedure court rules. The Courts of Conscience of boroughs in the Republic of Ireland were superseded under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 by the District Court, which operates throughout the state. Small claims cases were processed in the same manner as other summary judgments of the District Court until 1991, when a separate &quot;small claims procedure&quot; was first specified. The current District Court small claims procedure rules date from 2007, with amendments down to 2009. The European Small Claims Procedure is used where one party is in another EU member state.

===Kenya===
The Kenyan Small Claims Court was established in 2016 (formally launched on 26 April 2021 at Milimani Law Courts) under section 4 of the Small Claim Act No.2 of 2016. This court is a subordinate court as per Article 169(1) (d) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and its geographical jurisdiction covers sub-counties or any other units of decentralization under the Constitution.
Each Small Claims Court is presided over by an adjudicator appointed by the Judicial Service Commission. The Chief Justice can also designate any qualified person to act in as an adjudicator (section 6(1) and (2). To qualify under section 8 for appointment to be an adjudicator, a person must:
a) be an advocate of the High Court of Kenya with three years of legal experience, or
b) be trained as a paralegal at the Kenya School of Law.
The court deals with civil cases provided for under section 12 which arise from:
a) a contract for sale and supply of goods or services;
(b) a contract relating to money held and received;
(c) liability in tort in respect of loss or damage caused to any property or
for the delivery or recovery of movable property;
(d) compensation for personal injuries; and
(e) set-off and counterclaim under any contract.
Though the court’s pecuniary jurisdiction is limited to KES 1,000,000 (approximately US$10,000), Section 12(4) gives the Chief Justice the power to review that limit to any amount he thinks fit via a Gazette notice.

===Nigeria===
Small Claims court in Nigeria is similar to the ones in the United States and England. They are specially designated courts that hear and determine debt recovery cases of a small and liquidated debt.
The small claims courts were introduced in Lagos Nigeria in April 2018 by the former Chief Judge of Lagos State Justice Opeyemi Oke .
It is not clear if it was a world bank initiative or as a Lagos State Judiciary reform as the time of establishing the courts coincided with the PEBEC and world bank motive to improve the ease of doing business in Nigeria through seamless debt recovery court procedure.
At the establishment ceremony, 15 magistrates courts across the five magisterial districts of Lagos were designated as small claims court. The five magisterial districts include Lagos Island, Ikeja, Yaba, Badagry and Ikorodu.

The Kano State Judiciary followed in Lagos&#x27; steps and established its Small Claims Court on 24 January 2019 having similar jurisdiction as the Lagos State Small Claims Court. Five Courts were designated as Small Claims Courts and are located in Gwammaja, Gyadi-Gyadi, Nomansland and Dawakin Tofa.

The small claims courts are presided over by magistrates who hear and determine cases on debt claims not exceeding five million Naira.
It encompasses the routine collection of small debts, evictions and other disputes between landlords and tenants, as well as breach of contracts and simple torts. To institute a small claims matter, either the defendant or the claimant must be residing or doing business within the judicial division of the court.

===Singapore===
Similar to the UK, small-claims can be handled in Singapore through State Courts of Singapore.

===United Kingdom===
The rules and procedures differ for the different countries of the United Kingdom. While Britain was a member of the European Union, the European Small Claims Procedure for cross-border claims also applied.

====England and Wales====
England and Wales does not have a separate small claims court. They are usually dealt with in the County Court after being allocated to the small claims track of the County Court system. Small claims take place under a modified set of rules. Low-value cases, including most non-personal-injury cases up to £10,000, are usually assigned to the small claims track, producing a small claims action in the County Court. These cases are heard by district judges under an informal procedure.

An important difference between small claims and other civil claims is that the parties are usually unable to recover their legal costs, regardless of who wins or loses. For this reason, most individuals and businesses involved in small claims deal with them without legal representation. The winning party will, however, generally be able to recover the following costs, fee and expenses from the losing party:
* fixed costs on commencement;
* court fees;
* expenses reasonably incurred by the winner and his/her witnesses in travelling to/from a hearing or in staying away from home for the purposes of attending a hearing;
* loss of earnings or loss of leave for the winner and his/her witnesses due to attending a hearing or staying away from home for the purpose of attending a hearing (capped at £95 per day for each person);
* expert fees (capped at £750 for each expert)

The separate small claims procedure was first introduced for claims up to £75 in 1973. This flowed from the statutory power of judges to order arbitration. The limit was raised to £1,000 in 1991, £3,000 in 1996, £5,000 in 1999 and £10,000 in 2013. The limit is only a guideline. The court may allocate a case to the small claim track where the claim is over the guideline if it is considered that the case is simple enough that it is an appropriate way of disposing of the matter. A Money Claim Online service is available for larger, but still simple, claims.

====Northern Ireland====

The small claims process allows certain types of claims not exceeding £3,000 to be decided informally by the County Court.

====Scotland====
In Scotland small claims are handled by a process called simple procedure, subject to a limit of £5,000.

===United States===
The movement to establish small-claims courts typically began in the early 1960s, when justice of the peace courts were increasingly seen as obsolete, and officials felt it desirable to have such a court to allow people to represent themselves without legal counsel. In New York State, small claims courts were established in response to the 1958 findings of Governor Thomas E. Dewey&#x27;s Tweed Commission on the reorganization of the state judiciary. Since then, the movement towards small-claims courts has led to their establishment in most U.S. states.

There is no equivalent to a small-claims court in the federal court. (Note that Congress has set the jurisdictional minimum for diversity jurisdiction cases at greater than $75,000). Magistrate judges are authorized to handle certain preliminary matters. Since the year 2010, the costs of filing fees have increased in almost every state court system. Filing fees typically range from US$15 to $150, depending on the claim amount. The alternative to small claims court include less expensive, faster online dispute resolution and settlement services, where potential litigants settle their disputes at a lower cost without requiring or involving any adjudicative process.

===Greece===

In Greece they are called &quot;Ειρηνοδικεία&quot; or &quot;Πταισματοδικεία&quot; (Justices of Peace or Small-Claims Courts). They have only one judge.

According to Article 14 of the Civil Code (Jurisdiction of Magistrates&#x27; Courts and Single-Member Courts of First Instance due to an amount), the following are under its jurisdiction:

# All differences that can be valued in money and the value of their object does not exceed the amount of twenty thousand (20,000.00) euros.
All main or incidental differences from a lease agreement, as well as the differences of article 601 of the Civil Code, since in all these cases the agreed monthly rent does not exceed six hundred (600.00) euros
# The differences between the owners of floors or apartments from the relationship of the apartment ownership and the differences between the managers of property by floors and the owners of floors and apartments concerning common costs, as long as the value of their object does not exceed the amount of twenty thousand (20,000) euros.
According to Article 15 of the Civil Code (Extraordinary jurisdiction of a magistrate&#x27;s court without discrimination of value) the jurisdiction of the magistrate&#x27;s courts is subject to the jurisdiction of the magistrate&#x27;s courts regardless of the value of the subject of the dispute
# The differences from purchased land concerning the delivery of the use of the lease or its performance for any reason,
# Disputes concerning damage to trees, vines, fruits, seeds, roots and general plants, caused by illegal grazing of animals or in any other way,

# Disputes concerning the determination of distances imposed by laws and regulations or local customs for planting trees or plantations or for erecting fences or digging ditches;
# The disputes concerning the obstruction of the free use of roads and paths, as well as the damages caused by this obstruction,
# Disputes concerning the use of running water or the prevention of its use,

# The differences arising from the sale of animals, due to actual defects or lack of agreed properties.

Magistrates&#x27; courts are also responsible for issuing payment orders and rent payment orders for a claim within their jurisdiction, while from 1 March 2013 they are now responsible for the publication of wills, the issuance of inheritance certificates as well as for the registration or removal of a mortgage pre-notification.

==Classes==
Some jurisdictions offer classes in small-claims court procedures. As such courts are open to the public, attendance at a few sessions may be useful to a person involved in a case, whether as plaintiff or defendant.

==In popular culture==

Several small-claims proceedings have appeared on television in court shows. However, the settings in these programs are not truly courts of law: even though they attempt to give off the appearance as such, they are merely forms of arbitration. Such shows include &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, &quot;Judge Judy&quot;, &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot;, &quot;Judge Mathis&quot;, etc., all of which feature retired judges as the arbitrator.

<text>Ružomberok (; ; ; ) is a town in northern Slovakia, in the historical Liptov region. It has a population of approximately 27,000.

==Etymology==
The name of the initial settlement located on today&#x27;s Makovický street was &quot;Revúca&quot; (Slovak &quot;roaring&quot;, derived from the Revúca river). In its neighborhood, German colonists build a new settlement &quot;Rosenberg&quot; named after wild roses growing in the area. This name was later adopted by Slovaks as &quot;Ružomberok&quot;.

==Geography==
It is situated at the westernmost reaches of the Sub-Tatra Basin, more exactly its subdivision Liptov Basin, surrounded by the mountain ranges of Chočské vrchy, Greater Fatra and Low Tatras. Rivers flowing through the town are Váh, from east to west, Revúca, a left tributary from the south, on the way to Banská Bystrica and &quot;Likavka&quot; brook from the north, on the way to Dolný Kubín. The town is located around 65 km from Žilina, 190 km from Košice and 260 km from Bratislava (by road). Besides the main settlement, it also has &quot;city parts&quot; of Biely Potok, Černová, Hrboltová and Vlkolínec.

===Climate===
The climate is moderate, varies from hot in summer, to very cold in winter. There are four distinct seasons: spring (wet, moderate warm), summer (hot, very wet), autumn (dry) and winter (very cold). Ružomberok is located in the rain shadow of the mountain ranges of Greater Fatra and Chočské vrchy. Total annual precipitation is 727 mm. Annual average of days with snow cover is 68. The highest snow cover ever recorded was 92 cm. Extreme temperatures: high: (2007), low: (1949, 1986).

==History==
In 1233, King Andrew II of Hungary granted the land Revúca (&quot;terra Reuche&quot;) to his servant Hudko (&quot;Hudkonth&quot;, in the deed of confirmation &quot;Hudko&quot;). Hudko, his son Miloslav (&quot;Mylozou&quot;) and his offspring cultivated the land where the Slovak village Revúca had been founded in the 13th century. Before the 1320s, Germans founded a new settlement, Rosenberg (&quot;possesio Rozumberg&quot;), right on the hill near the older village. In 1329, Revúca became a part of Ružomberok and received a new name Podhora (&quot;Sub Monte&quot;).

In 1340, Charles I of Hungary confirmed the town rights: burgesses and &quot;guests&quot; (German colonists) had the same rights as in Ľupča (now Partizánska Ľupča). The extent of previous rights is not completely clear. Ružomberok allegedly had the similar rights since 1318, but the charter preserved only in copy could be fake. The Germans had had a dominant position probably until 1431 when many rich families left the town under the pressure of the Hussites. The town council was then controlled by Slovaks, and during the 15th century, the town was Slovakised.

In the 19th century, the town was one of the centres of the Slovak national movement. It slowly became one of the industrial and financial centres of the Kingdom of Hungary, particularly after the Kassa Oderberg Railway was completed in 1871, when many new factories emerged: paper and pulpwood works but also brick works (1871) and the textile industry.

In 1907, in Černová, which was rather a street than part of the town, had an event known as the Černová tragedy.

After the break-up of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Ružomberok became a part of Czechoslovakia. However, when Czechoslovakia was broken up in 1939, it was incorporated into the First Slovak Republic and was a capital of one of the counties, Tatra County (&quot;Tatranská župa&quot;). On 5 April 1945, Ružomberok was captured by troops of the I Czechoslovak Army Corps, acting as a part of the Soviet 4th Ukrainian Front. Ružomberok became again part of Czechoslovakia, and after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, it became part of Slovakia. In 1995, Ruzomberok became a district town.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 census, the town had 30,417 inhabitants. 96.64% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.95% Roma and 0.87% Czech. The religious make-up was 75.47% Roman Catholics, 14.65% people with no religious affiliation, and 5.46% Lutherans.

More recent census results from 2021 show the number of inhabitants has decreased to 27,407, with the Slovak, Czech, and Roma populations decreasing to 92.23%, 0.47%, and 0.33% respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of Roman Catholics has decreased to 62.37%, whereas the number of people with no religious affiliation has increased to 23.09%.

== Industry and commerce ==
Ružomberok was famous in the 20th century as an industrial town. The resulting pollution has remained one of the biggest challenges the town faces. It had the largest cotton mill in Slovakia: &quot;BZVIL&quot; or &quot;Texicom&quot;; and still has one of the largest exporter businesses in Slovakia: Mondi SCP, formerly known as &quot;SCPSeveroslovenské celulózky a papierne&quot;. Texicom went bankrupt in 2006. Mondi SCP is a paper and pulp factory and is the biggest employer in the Ružomberok district and the Liptov region. The town also has a brick factory located in the south.

Ružomberok is nowadays also considered as a good shopping town, with almost all supermarket brands. These include Billa, Tesco, Lidl, Kaufland, Jednota, Hypernova, Verex and Kinekus. Aupark and Aldi are also planned.

== Schools ==
Apart from its numerous primary and secondary school, the town also has 2 grammar schools and 2 universities. The Catholic University is based in Ružomberok and the University of Žilina has a branch in the town. From September 2007 it is not possible to study at detached workplace of University of Žilina.

==Landmarks and culture==

The centre of the town is located at the Andrej Hlinka Square (&quot;Námestie Andreja Hlinku&quot;). Among the sights in or around the square are the Roman Catholic Church of St. Andrew, first mentioned in 1318, originally built in a Gothic but now presenting a Renaissance–Baroque style; town hall, built in 1895 in the neo-Baroque style and the church and monastery of the Holy Cross (built 1806 and 1730 respectively).

Cultural institutions in the towns include the Liptov Museum, established in 1912 which also has exhibitions outside the town. These include the Likava Castle, which is just outside the town in the Likavka village; and the Museum of the Liptov Village in Pribylina.

The Ľudovít Fulla Gallery is a branch of the Slovak National Gallery and is dedicated to Fulla&#x27;s works of art. The gallery also hosts the concert series &quot;Hudba u Fullu&quot; (&quot;Music at Fulla&quot;). In recent years, the programme of the series has included works by composers such as Vladimír Godár, Peter Machajdík, Arvo Pärt, Philip Glass, Valentin Silvestrov, Gavin Bryars, and many others. In November 2017, the Ľudovít Fulla Gallery hosted the international sound art and multimedia festival &quot;Sound Art vs. Multimedia&quot;.

The town also has the only scout museum in Slovakia.

Other sights within the town include the Evangelic church from 1923 to 1926, a historic building of the railway station from 1871, now protected as a national historic monument; Calvary above the town in the Classicist style, built in 1858; synagogue from 1880; and the church in Černová, where the tragedy in 1907 happened.

Attractions in the surroundings include the Čebrať mountain (1,054 m), Vlkolínec village, inscribed in 1993 to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list, and the skiing area of Malinô Brdo (also called Malinné).

==Sport==
The women&#x27;s basketball team MBK Ružomberok is the most successful basketball team in Slovakia&#x27;s sport history, with two EuroLeague Women victories. The men&#x27;s football team MFK Ružomberok plays in the Slovak First Football League. In 2006, it was champion of both the first league (at the time: &quot;Corgoň liga&quot;) and the Slovak FA Cup.

<text>The  () is the foremost technical Grand Corps of the French State (). It is composed of the state industrial engineers. The Corps is attached to the French Ministry of Economy and Finance. Its purpose is to entice French students in mathematics and physics to serve the government and train them for executive careers in France.

Members are educated at the , also known as Mines ParisTech. Each year, the Corps recruits between 10 and 20 members. Most of them are alumni from , who are usually among the top ranked students, others come from (ENS), Télécom Paris or regular graduates of the Mines ParisTech. Upon graduation, engineers hold executive positions in the French administration.

 engineers tend to hold top executive positions in France&#x27;s major industrial companies in the course of their career.

Being admitted to the program is considered a significant fast-track for executive careers in France.

==Missions==

&quot;Corps des Mines&quot; engineers contribute to the conception, implementation and evaluation of public policies in the fields of:

*industry and economy
*energy and natural resources
*information and communication technologies
*environment sustainability, industrial safety and public health
*research, innovation and new technologies
*land use planning and transportation
*standardization and metrology
*banking, insurance and financial services

&quot;Corps des Mines&quot; engineers typically hold high-level technical or executive positions in various ministries or international organizations. 
After serving in the administration, part of the &quot;Corps des Mines&quot; engineers transfer to the private sector, where they hold top executive positions in large industrial companies.

==Recruitment and training==

&quot;Corps des Mines&quot; engineers are recruited among the top students from École polytechnique, École normale supérieure, École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris and Télécom ParisTech. About twenty engineers enroll every year. During the course of their training, the &quot;Corps des Mines&quot; engineers have to complete two one-year positions in private companies (one in France and one abroad), followed by a one-year training in public administration, hosted at École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris.

The main aim of the training is to provide theoretical and practical knowledge about how companies operate, together with a sound understanding of government responsibilities in the technical and economic fields.

<text>A prize is an award to be given to a person or a group of people (such as sporting teams and organizations) to recognize and reward their actions and achievements. Official prizes often involve monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are also associated with extravagant awarding ceremonies, such as the Academy Awards.

Prizes are also given to publicize noteworthy or exemplary behaviour, and to provide incentives for improved outcomes and competitive efforts. In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy.

Specific types of prizes include:
* Booby prize: typically awarded as a joke or insult to whoever finished last (e.g., wooden spoon award).
* : an award given to those who do not win but are deemed worthy of recognition.
* Hierarchical prizes, where the best award is &quot;first prize&quot;, &quot;grand prize&quot;, or &quot;gold medal&quot;. Subordinate awards are &quot;second prize&quot;, &quot;third prize&quot;, etc., or &quot;first runner-up&quot; and &quot;second runner-up&quot;, etc., or &quot;silver medal&quot; and &quot;bronze medal&quot;. (In some contests, &quot;grand prize&quot; is more desirable than &quot;first prize&quot;.)
**On game shows in the UK, the term is &quot;star prize&quot;, while in Australia, it is &quot;major prize&quot;.
* &quot;Purchase prize&quot; or acquisition prize: a monetary prize given in an art competition in exchange for the winning work.
* Winnings from an inducement prize contest, usually a reward for accomplishing a specific feat of use to the sponsor or society at large

<text>Thomas Willingale (1799–1870), lived in the village of Loughton in Essex, United Kingdom. He was instrumental in the preservation of Epping Forest (which struggle was seminal in the national and indeed international conservation movement) and is still remembered for his actions. He is commemorated by an article in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, on which this article is based.

&quot;Lopping&quot; was the ancient practice of cutting or lopping the boughs and branches of trees by commoners for use as fuel during winter. Thomas Willingale was a man who guarded this right, and every November 11 at midnight, he went into the forest as he believed that if no-one started lopping at the appointed hour, the rights would be lost forever.

In 1860, the lords of the manor were encroaching on the forest to stop the commoners from practicing their lopping rights. There is a legend which cannot be proved or disproved, but is still commonly told in Loughton, that the major local landowner, William Whitaker Maitland, tried to end this custom by inviting all those with rights to lop to a supper at the King&#x27;s Head pub (now a restaurant in the &quot;Zizzi&quot; chain), in Loughton High Road. He was hoping that by midnight, they would all be too drunk to go into the forest and exercise their rights. The legend says that Thomas Willingale realised treachery was afoot, and at midnight he lopped off a branch before triumphantly returning to the King&#x27;s Head.

Four years later, the Revd John Whitaker Maitland enclosed 1,318 acres (5 km2) of forest land, with the intention of selling this on for building or horticulture. Thomas Willingale was incensed of this further erosion of commoner rights in the forest and decided to fight the enclosure. He continued to lop and was prosecuted at Waltham Abbey court; some members of his family, though not Thomas himself, were imprisoned as a result. Luckily a number of well-to-do people came to Thomas&#x27;s aid, promising support and more importantly financial help. These included Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton of Warlies, a prominent landowner, his brother Edward North Buxton of Knighton, a leading member of the Commons Preservation Society and John T. Bedford, a member of the City of London Corporation.

Eventually the City of London Corporation was persuaded to take on the landowners and “secure for the People, for the purposes of public health and recreation” the remainder of the forest of Epping. Legal proceedings by the Corporation, against the enclosures began August 1871 resulting, ultimately, in the Epping Forest Act 1878.

Unfortunately, Thomas Willingale died in 1870 and was unable to see the forest given the protection it deserved. The abolition of lopping was, however, part of this settlement.

Today, Epping Forest is still enjoyed for recreation by thousands of people each year. The forest itself is protected from development of any kind, and as a result still stretches from the heart of East London out into the Essex countryside, a green lung for the area which has of course become much more built up since 1878. Thomas Willingale is commemorated in Loughton by the street name Willingale Road, the Thomas Willingale School, and formerly had a pub named after him in Chingford (renamed &quot;The Station House&quot; in 2006). The Lopping Hall in Loughton was paid for out of compensation money for extinguishment of the lopping rights. It contains a carved hornbeam memorial tablet to Willingale and its north entrance includes a terracotta pediment illustrating loppers at work in the forest. There is a blue plaque on the wall of St John&#x27;s Churchyard, where Willingale is buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave. There is no known likeness of Willingale. Those extant in the town are of his son, also Thomas.

<text>Jean Baptiste Perrin (30 September 1870 – 17 April 1942) was a French physicist who, in his studies of the Brownian motion of minute particles suspended in liquids (sedimentation equilibrium), verified Albert Einstein&#x27;s explanation of this phenomenon and thereby confirmed the atomic nature of matter. For this achievement he was honoured with the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Born in Lille, France, Perrin attended the École Normale Supérieure, the elite grande école in Paris. He became an assistant at the school during the period of 1894–97 when he began the study of cathode rays and X-rays. He was awarded the degree of &quot;docteur ès sciences&quot; (beyond PhD) in 1897. In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in physical chemistry at the Sorbonne, Paris. He became a professor at the University in 1910, holding this post until the German occupation of France during World War II.
=== Research and achievements ===

In 1895, Perrin showed that cathode rays were of negative electric charge in nature. He determined the Avogadro constant by several methods. He explained solar energy as due to the thermonuclear reactions of hydrogen.

In 1901 he proposed a hypothesis that each atom might have a positively charged nucleus, similarly to Hantaro Nagaoka later, but never developed it further. It came to be known the Rutherford model.

By mid 1900s, Perrin was interested in statistical mechanics questions, which are close to the study of Brownian motion. Following Albert Einstein&#x27;s publication (1905) of a theoretical explanation of Brownian motion in terms of atoms, Perrin (along with Joseph Ulysses Chaudesaigues who was working in Perrin&#x27;s lab) did the experimental work to test and verify Einstein&#x27;s predictions, thereby providing data that would settle the century-long dispute about John Dalton&#x27;s atomic theory, before the end of the decade. Carl Benedicks argued Perrin should receive the Nobel Prize in Physics; Perrin received the award in 1926 for this and other work on the discontinuous structure of matter, which put a definite end to the long struggle regarding the question of the physical reality of molecules.

Perrin was the author of a number of books and dissertations. Most notable of his publications were: &quot;Rayons cathodiques et rayons X&quot;; &quot;Les Principes&quot;; &quot;Electrisation de contact&quot;; &quot;Réalité moléculaire&quot;; &quot;Matière et Lumière&quot;; &quot;Lumière et Reaction chimique&quot;.

Perrin was also the recipient of numerous prestigious awards including the Joule Prize of the Royal Society in 1896 and the La Caze Prize of the French Academy of Sciences. He was twice appointed a member of the Solvay Committee at Brussels in 1911 and in 1921. He also held memberships with the Royal Society of London and with the Academies of Sciences of Belgium, Sweden, Turin, Prague, Romania and China. He became a Commander of the Legion of Honour in 1926 and was made Commander of the Order of Léopold (Belgium).

In 1919, Perrin proposed that nuclear reactions can provide the source of energy in stars. He realized that the mass of a helium atom is less than that of four atoms of hydrogen, and that the mass-energy equivalence of Einstein implies that the nuclear fusion (4 H → He) could liberate sufficient energy to make stars shine for billions of years. A similar theory was first proposed by American chemist William Draper Harkins in 1915. It remained for Hans Bethe and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker to determine the detailed mechanism of stellar nucleosynthesis during the 1930s.

In 1927, he founded the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique together with chemist André Job and physiologist André Mayer. Funding was provided by Edmond James de Rothschild. In 1937, Perrin established the Palais de la Découverte, a science museum in Paris.

Perrin is considered the founding father of the National Centre for Scientific Research (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)). Following a petition by Perrin signed by over 80 scientists, among them eight Nobel Prize laureates, the French education minister set up the Conseil Supérieur de la Recherche Scientifique (French National Research Council) in April 1933. In 1936, Perrin, now an undersecretary for research, founded the Service Central de la Recherche Scientifique (French Central Agency for Scientific Research). Both institutions were merged under the CNRS umbrella on October 19, 1939.

His notable students include Pierre Victor Auger. Jean Perrin was the father of Francis Perrin, also a physicist.

=== Personal life and death ===
Perrin was an atheist and a socialist. He was an officer in the engineer corps during World War I. In 1915 he was appointed the deputy chief of the Directorate of Inventions for National Defense which aimed to coordinate French laboratories in the war effort.

After the death of Perrin&#x27;s wife Henriette in 1938, Nine Choucroun (1896–1978), founder of the &quot;Nine Choucroun Prize&quot;, became Perrin&#x27;s partner. In June 1940, when the Germans invaded France, Choucroun and Perrin escaped to Casablanca on the ocean liner &quot;Massilia&quot;, with part of the French government. In December 1941, they boarded the &quot;SS Excambion&quot; to New York City, arriving on December 23.

Perrin died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York on 17 April 1942 at the age of 71.

After the War, in 1948, his remains were transported back to France by the cruiser &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; and buried in the Panthéon.

<text>Palaiseau () is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. Palaiseau is a sub-prefecture of the Essonne department and the seat of the Arrondissement of Palaiseau.

Palaiseau was a royal domain in the 6th century then again in the 18th century on the important road from Chartres to Paris. The population grew from the 19th century with the arrival of the railway connecting the town to Paris. Palaiseau then became a vacation spot, writers such as George Sand, Alexandre Dumas, Charles Péguy built their villas near the stations. A ranking from the newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot; in 2018 ranks Palaiseau as the third town in Essonne where it is good to be a parent.

The town is home to several major French &quot;Grandes écoles&quot; on its territory: the École Polytechnique, the Institut d&#x27;optique Graduate School, ENSTA ParisTech, ENSAE ParisTech, the Institut Mines-Télécom, AgroParisTech as well as research centers Onera, Danone, Thales and EDF.

Inhabitants of Palaiseau are known as &quot;Palaisiens&quot;.

==Population==

==Education==
, the primary schools in Palaiseau have 2,770 students. There are 12 public preschools (&quot;maternelles&quot;) and 10 public elementary schools.

Public secondary schools:
* Junior high schools: Collège César-Franck, Collège Charles-Péguy, Collège Joseph-Bara
* Senior high schools: Lycée professionnel Henri-Poincaré, Lycée Camille Claudel

The Institution Saint-Martin is a private school from preschool to high school.

===Colleges and universities===
ParisTech has a strong presence in Palaiseau, with four member institutes: the (one of the most prestigious engineering schools in France), École nationale de la statistique et de l&#x27;administration économique, École nationale supérieure de techniques avancées, and Institut d&#x27;optique Graduate School which are now located in Palaiseau, on the Plateau de Saclay. The first three institutes are now grouped together in the Polytechnic Institute of Paris and the last one is a member of the Paris-Saclay University.

==Transport==
Palaiseau is served by 3 stations on Paris RER line B: Palaiseau, Palaiseau – Villebon and Lozère (this last station is the closest to &quot;École Polytechnique&quot;). The station Massy-Palaiseau (RER B, RER C and also TGV, the French high-speed rail) is located in the nearby town of Massy.

==Twin towns==

Palaiseau is twinned with Unna, Germany.

<doc id="574005" wikidata="Q1225262" url="?curid=574005" title="William Spottiswoode">
<text>William H. Spottiswoode HFRSE LLD (11 January 1825 – 27 June 1883) was an English mathematician, physicist and partner in the printing and publishing firm Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode. He was president of the Royal Society from 1878 to 1883.

== Biography==

===Early life===
Spottiswoode was born in London on 11 January 1825, the son of Andrew Spottiswoode and his wife, Mary Longman. His father was descended from an ancient Scottish family, represented Colchester in parliament for some years, and in 1831 became junior partner in the firm of Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, printers.

William was educated at Laleham Lea School, Eton College, and Harrow School. He then studied Mathematics and Physics at Balliol College, Oxford. His talent for science showed itself while he was still a schoolboy, and indeed his removal from Eton to Harrow is said to have been occasioned by an accidental explosion which occurred whilst he was performing an experiment for his own amusement. At Harrow he obtained a Lyon scholarship in 1842, and at Oxford in 1845 a first-class in mathematics, in 1846 the junior and in 1847 the senior university mathematical scholarship.

===Family===
On 27 November 1861 at Bexley in Kent, he married Elisa (&quot;Lise&quot;) Taylor Arbuthnot (1837–1894), daughter of William Urquhart Arbuthnot (son of Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet).

Their children included William Hugh Spottiswoode (1864–1915) and Cyril Andrew Spottiswoode (1867–1915).

==Career==
In 1846 he left Oxford to take his father&#x27;s place in the business, in which he was engaged until his death.

In 1847 Spottiswoode issued five pamphlets entitled &quot;Meditationes Analyticae&quot;, that explored complex mathematical ideas through analytic methods, particularly focusing on functions and calculus. These pamphlets, among other things, exhibited advanced mathematical analytics and solutions to complex equations that examined the behavior of mathematical functions more deeply and precisely. These were his first publications of original mathematical work. From then on, he published new research almost every year.

In 1856 Spottiswoode travelled in eastern Russia, and in 1860 in Croatia and Hungary; of the former expedition he has left a record, &quot;A Tarantasse Journey through Eastern Russia in the Autumn of 1856&quot; (London, 1857).

In 1870 he was elected president of the London Mathematical Society. In 1871 he began to turn his attention to experimental physics, his earlier researches bearing upon the light polarization and his later work upon the electrical discharge in rarefied gases. He wrote a popular treatise on the former subject for the &quot;Nature Series&quot; in 1874. In 1878 he was elected president of the British Association and in the same year president of the Royal Society, of which he had been a fellow since 1853.

He died in London of typhoid fever on 27 June 1883 and was buried in the south transept of Westminster Abbey.

As a mathematician, he occupied himself with many branches of his favorite science, more especially with higher algebra, including the theory of determinants, with the general calculus of symbols, and with the application of analysis to geometry and mechanics.

The following brief review of his mathematical work is quoted from the obituary notice which appeared in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot; (xxxviii. 34):
His papers, numbering over 100, were published principally in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society&quot;, &quot;Quarterly Journal of Mathematics&quot;, &quot;Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society&quot; and &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot;, and one or two in the &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; of the Paris Academy; a list of them, arranged according to the several journals in which they originally appeared, with short notes upon the less familiar memoirs, is given in &quot;Nature&quot;, xxvii, 599.

<text>Josef Mysliveček (9 March 1737 – 4 February 1781) was a Czech composer who contributed to the formation of late eighteenth-century classicism in music. Mysliveček provided his younger friend Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with significant compositional models in the genres of symphony, Italian serious opera, and violin concerto; both Wolfgang and his father Leopold Mozart considered him an intimate friend from the time of their first meetings in Bologna in 1770 until he betrayed their trust over the promise of an operatic commission for Wolfgang to be arranged with the management of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. His closeness to the Mozart family resulted in frequent references to him in the Mozart correspondence.
==Biography==

Mysliveček was born in Prague, one of twin sons of a prosperous mill owner, and studied philosophy at Charles-Ferdinand University before following in the footsteps of his father. No documentation exists to support claims that he was actually born in Horní Šárka, a rural district to the north and west of Prague in the early eighteenth century. He achieved the rank of master miller in 1761, but gave up the family profession in order to pursue musical studies. In Prague, he studied composition with Franz Habermann and Josef Seger in the early 1760s. His ambitions led him to travel to Venice in 1763 to study with Giovanni Pescetti. His travel to Italy was subsidized in part from family wealth, in part from the Bohemian nobleman Vincenz von Waldstein. In Italy he became known as &quot;Il Boemo&quot; (&quot;the Bohemian&quot;) and also &quot;Venatorino&quot; (&quot;the little hunter&quot;), a literal translation of his name. Reports that he was known as &quot;Il divino Boemo&quot; (&quot;the Divine Bohemian&quot;) during his lifetime are false. The nickname originated from the title of a &quot;romanetto&quot; about the composer by Jakub Arbes that was first published in 1884. He was made a member of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna in 1771. Mysliveček prized freedom of movement and was never employed directly by any noble, prelate, or ruler, unlike most of his contemporaries. He earned his living through teaching, performing, and composing music, and frequently received gratuities from wealthy admirers.

After his arrival in Italy in 1763, Mysliveček never left the country except for a visit to Prague in 1767–68, a short visit to Vienna in 1773, and an extended stay in Munich between December 1776 and April 1778. His return to Prague led to the production of several of his operas. He was invited to Munich by the musical establishment of the Elector Maximilian III Joseph to compose an opera for the carnival season of 1777 (&quot;Ezio&quot;).

Mysliveček&#x27;s first opera, &quot;Semiramide&quot;, was performed at Bergamo in 1766 (there is no evidence that a putative production at Parma of an opera titled &quot;Medea&quot; ever took place). His &quot;Il Bellerofonte&quot; was a great success in Naples after its first performance at the Teatro San Carlo on 20 January 1767, and it led to a number of commissions from Italian theaters. Ever after, his productions would almost always feature first-rate singers in the leading roles. Almost all of his operas were successful until a disastrous production of &quot;Armida&quot; that took place at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan for the carnival season of 1780. One of the many honors that came to him for his talents as a composer of opera was a commission to provide the music for the opening of a new opera theater in Pavia in 1773 (his first setting of Metastasio&#x27;s libretto &quot;Demetrio&quot;).

Other than a reputation for promiscuity recorded in the Mozart correspondence, nothing is known of Mysliveček&#x27;s love life. The composer never married, and no names of lovers are recorded. There is no documentation to support reports of romantic liaisons with the singers Caterina Gabrielli and Lucrezia Aguiari; no mention of love affairs with these singers pre-dates the publication of the fifth edition of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1954).

Financially irresponsible throughout his life, he died destitute in Rome in 1781. He is buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina, where a memorial placed by latter-day Czech admirers can be seen. No trace has ever been found of a memorial in marble supposedly erected shortly after his death by James Hugh Smith Barry, a wealthy English student of Mysliveček who paid for his funeral expenses.

==Relationship with Mozart==
In 1770 Mysliveček met the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Bologna. He was close to the Mozart family until 1778, when contacts were broken off after he failed to make good on a promise to arrange an opera commission for Mozart at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. Earlier, the Mozarts found his dynamic personality irresistible. In a letter to his father Leopold written from Munich on 11 October 1777, Mozart described his character as &quot;full of fire, spirit and life&quot;.

Similarities in his musical style with the earlier works of Mozart have often been noted. Additionally, Mozart used musical motifs drawn from various Mysliveček compositions to help fashion opera arias, symphonic movements, keyboard sonatas, and concertos. He also made an arrangement or transcription for voice and pianoforte of the aria &quot;Ridente la calma&quot;, an aria sung on several occasion with different texts by the famous castrato soprano Luigi Marchesi. The aria had probably been written for the star singer by Mysliveček with the words &quot;Il caro mio bene&quot; and inserted in his hasty re-working of his own opera &quot;Armida&quot; of 1780, after the premiere had failed probably because it was deemed too experimental (and too &quot;French&quot;) by the Milanese audience. In fact the aria appears in the score of the Mysliveček opera in the Palacio de Ajuda library but it is absent from the printed libretto prepared for the premiere. Thus, it is probable that this aria pre-existed &quot;Armida&quot; and we cannot be sure whether its author is Mysliveček, Marchesi himself or some other composer. The musicologist Paolo V. Montanari discovered that Luigi Marchesi kept this aria as a &quot;baggage aria&quot; throughout his career, inserting it in various operas and cantatas by other composers, such as &quot;Il trionfo della pace&quot; (Turin, 1782) by Francesco Bianchi (from which the text &quot;Ridente la calma&quot; comes) and &quot;Angelica e Medoro&quot; by Gaetano Andreozzi (Venice, 1791). Mozart&#x27;s arrangement or transcription - probably written after Marchesi&#x27;s triumph in Vienna in 1785 in Giuseppe Sarti&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Sabino&quot; - is known with the catalogue number KV 152 (210a).

According to the same letter of Wolfgang Mozart written from Munich on 11 October 1777, an incompetent surgeon burned off Mysliveček&#x27;s nose while trying to treat a mysterious illness. A letter of Leopold Mozart to his son of 1 October 1777 refers to the illness as something shameful for which Mysliveček was deserving of social ostracism. Mysliveček&#x27;s reputation for sexual promiscuity, Leopold&#x27;s insinuations, and the reference to facial disfigurement in Wolfgang&#x27;s letter hint unmistakably at the symptoms of tertiary syphilis. Mysliveček&#x27;s explanation for his condition to Wolfgang – bone cancer caused by a carriage accident — seems preposterous. The concern Mozart revealed to his father at this time for Mysliveček&#x27;s sufferings was very touching. In the entire Mozart correspondence, no individual outside the Mozart family was ever the cause for so much outpouring of emotion as what is found in Wolfgang&#x27;s letter of 11 October 1777.

==Compositions==

In all, he wrote twenty-six opere serie, including the aforementioned &quot;Il Bellerofonte&quot;. Nearly all were successful at their first performances until the disaster of &quot;Armida&quot; at La Scala during carnival of 1780. Some of the irregularities that doomed this production were not Mysliveček&#x27;s fault, such as the interruption of performances caused by the lying-in of the &quot;prima donna&quot; Caterina Gabrielli, who gave birth, out of wedlock, in the middle of the run, at the age of 49.

During the period of his activity as a composer of operas (1766–1780), Mysliveček succeeded in having more new &quot;opere serie&quot; brought into production than any other composer in Europe. It is noteworthy that in this same period more of his works were performed at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples, the most prestigious venue in Italy at that time for productions of serious opera, than those of any other composer. Nonetheless, his contributions to Italian operatic culture of the 1760s and 1770s have been almost universally ignored by opera historians.

Mysliveček and Gluck were the first Czechs to become famous as operatic composers, but their output exhibits few, if any, Czech characteristics. Mysliveček&#x27;s operas were very much rooted in a style of Italian &quot;opera seria&quot; that prized above all the vocal artistry to be found in elaborate arias.

Among his other pieces were oratorios, symphonies, concertos, and chamber music, including the Op. 2 string quintets which were almost certainly the earliest string quintets with two violas ever published. Additionally, he was a pioneer in the composition of music for wind ensemble, the outstanding examples of which are his three wind octets. It may be fair to say that his greatest composition is the oratorio &quot;Isacco figura del Redentore&quot;, first performed in Florence in 1776. His violin concertos are perhaps the finest composed between the generation of Vivaldi and the Mozart violin concertos of 1775.

He was also one of the most gifted and most prolific composers of eighteenth-century symphonies, although his contributions to this genre have been ignored by musicologists in western Europe and North America almost as completely as his operas have been. Nearly all of Mysliveček&#x27;s symphonies are cast in three movements without a minuet, following Italian traditions that originated in opera overtures. His opera overtures are also cast in three movements and were frequently performed as independent instrumental pieces. In the 1770s, he was the finest symphonist resident in Italy, and the esteem he enjoyed is reflected in the issuance of a set of symphonies (originally opera overtures) published by Ranieri del Vivo in Florence that was the first anthology of symphonies ever printed in Italy.

Mysliveček&#x27;s compositions evoke a gracious, diatonic style typical of Italian classicism in music. His best works are characterized by melodic inventiveness, logical continuity, and a certain emotional intensity that may be attributable to his dynamic personality.

<text>In mathematics and signal processing, the Hilbert transform is a specific singular integral that takes a function, of a real variable and produces another function of a real variable . The Hilbert transform is given by the Cauchy principal value of the convolution with the function formula_1 (see ). The Hilbert transform has a particularly simple representation in the frequency domain: It imparts a phase shift of ±90° (/2 radians) to every frequency component of a function, the sign of the shift depending on the sign of the frequency (see ). The Hilbert transform is important in signal processing, where it is a component of the analytic representation of a real-valued signal . The Hilbert transform was first introduced by David Hilbert in this setting, to solve a special case of the Riemann–Hilbert problem for analytic functions.

== Definition ==
The Hilbert transform of can be thought of as the convolution of with the function , known as the Cauchy kernel. Because 1/ is not integrable across , the integral defining the convolution does not always converge. Instead, the Hilbert transform is defined using the Cauchy principal value (denoted here by ). Explicitly, the Hilbert transform of a function (or signal) is given by

formula_2

provided this integral exists as a principal value. This is precisely the convolution of with the tempered distribution . Alternatively, by changing variables, the principal-value integral can be written explicitly as

formula_3

When the Hilbert transform is applied twice in succession to a function , the result is

formula_4

provided the integrals defining both iterations converge in a suitable sense. In particular, the inverse transform is 
formula_5. This fact can most easily be seen by considering the effect of the Hilbert transform on the Fourier transform of (see below).

For an analytic function in the upper half-plane, the Hilbert transform describes the relationship between the real part and the imaginary part of the boundary values. That is, if is analytic in the upper half complex plane , and , then up to an additive constant, provided this Hilbert transform exists.

===Notation===
In signal processing the Hilbert transform of is commonly denoted by formula_6. However, in mathematics, this notation is already extensively used to denote the Fourier transform of . Occasionally, the Hilbert transform may be denoted by formula_7. Furthermore, many sources define the Hilbert transform as the negative of the one defined here.

== History ==
The Hilbert transform arose in Hilbert&#x27;s 1905 work on a problem Riemann posed concerning analytic functions, which has come to be known as the Riemann–Hilbert problem. Hilbert&#x27;s work was mainly concerned with the Hilbert transform for functions defined on the circle. Some of his earlier work related to the Discrete Hilbert Transform dates back to lectures he gave in Göttingen. The results were later published by Hermann Weyl in his dissertation. Schur improved Hilbert&#x27;s results about the discrete Hilbert transform and extended them to the integral case. These results were restricted to the spaces and. In 1928, Marcel Riesz proved that the Hilbert transform can be defined for &quot;u&quot; in formula_8 (Lp space) for , that the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator on formula_8 for , and that similar results hold for the Hilbert transform on the circle as well as the discrete Hilbert transform. The Hilbert transform was a motivating example for Antoni Zygmund and Alberto Calderón during their study of singular integrals. Their investigations have played a fundamental role in modern harmonic analysis. Various generalizations of the Hilbert transform, such as the bilinear and trilinear Hilbert transforms are still active areas of research today.

== Relationship with the Fourier transform ==
The Hilbert transform is a multiplier operator. The multiplier of is , where is the signum function. Therefore:

formula_10

where formula_11 denotes the Fourier transform. Since , it follows that this result applies to the three common definitions of formula_12.

By Euler&#x27;s formula,
formula_13

Therefore, has the effect of shifting the phase of the negative frequency components of by +90° ( radians) and the phase of the positive frequency components by −90°, and has the effect of restoring the positive frequency components while shifting the negative frequency ones an additional +90°, resulting in their negation (i.e., a multiplication by −1).

When the Hilbert transform is applied twice, the phase of the negative and positive frequency components of are respectively shifted by +180° and −180°, which are equivalent amounts. The signal is negated; i.e., , because

formula_14

== Table of selected Hilbert transforms ==
In the following table, the frequency parameter formula_15 is real.

Notes

An extensive table of Hilbert transforms is available.
Note that the Hilbert transform of a constant is zero.

==Domain of definition==
It is by no means obvious that the Hilbert transform is well-defined at all, as the improper integral defining it must converge in a suitable sense. However, the Hilbert transform is well-defined for a broad class of functions, namely those in formula_8 for .

More precisely, if is in formula_8 for , then the limit defining the improper integral

formula_18

exists for almost every . The limit function is also in formula_8 and is in fact the limit in the mean of the improper integral as well. That is,

formula_20

as in the norm, as well as pointwise almost everywhere, by the Titchmarsh theorem.

In the case , the Hilbert transform still converges pointwise almost everywhere, but may itself fail to be integrable, even locally. In particular, convergence in the mean does not in general happen in this case. The Hilbert transform of an function does converge, however, in -weak, and the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator from to . (In particular, since the Hilbert transform is also a multiplier operator on , Marcinkiewicz interpolation and a duality argument furnishes an alternative proof that is bounded on .)

== Properties ==

===Boundedness===
If , then the Hilbert transform on formula_8 is a bounded linear operator, meaning that there exists a constant such that

formula_22

for all 

The best constant formula_23 is given by
formula_24

An easy way to find the best formula_23 for formula_26 being a power of 2 is through the so-called Cotlar&#x27;s identity that formula_27 for all real valued . The same best constants hold for the periodic Hilbert transform.

The boundedness of the Hilbert transform implies the formula_8 convergence of the symmetric partial sum operator 
formula_29

to in 

===Anti-self adjointness===
The Hilbert transform is an anti-self adjoint operator relative to the duality pairing between formula_8 and the dual space where and are Hölder conjugates and . Symbolically,

formula_31

for formula_32 and 

===Inverse transform===
The Hilbert transform is an anti-involution, meaning that

formula_33

provided each transform is well-defined. Since preserves the space this implies in particular that the Hilbert transform is invertible on and that

formula_34

===Complex structure===
Because (&quot;&quot; is the identity operator) on the real Banach space of &quot;real&quot;-valued functions in the Hilbert transform defines a linear complex structure on this Banach space. In particular, when , the Hilbert transform gives the Hilbert space of real-valued functions in formula_35 the structure of a &quot;complex&quot; Hilbert space.

The (complex) eigenstates of the Hilbert transform admit representations as holomorphic functions in the upper and lower half-planes in the Hardy space  by the Paley–Wiener theorem.

===Differentiation===
Formally, the derivative of the Hilbert transform is the Hilbert transform of the derivative, i.e. these two linear operators commute:

formula_36

Iterating this identity,

formula_37

This is rigorously true as stated provided and its first derivatives belong to One can check this easily in the frequency domain, where differentiation becomes multiplication by .

===Convolutions===
The Hilbert transform can formally be realized as a convolution with the tempered distribution

formula_38

Thus formally,

formula_39

However, &quot;a priori&quot; this may only be defined for a distribution of compact support. It is possible to work somewhat rigorously with this since compactly supported functions (which are distributions &quot;a fortiori&quot;) are dense in . Alternatively, one may use the fact that &quot;h&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the distributional derivative of the function ; to wit

formula_40

For most operational purposes the Hilbert transform can be treated as a convolution. For example, in a formal sense, the Hilbert transform of a convolution is the convolution of the Hilbert transform applied on &quot;only one&quot; of either of the factors:

formula_41

This is rigorously true if and are compactly supported distributions since, in that case,

formula_42

By passing to an appropriate limit, it is thus also true if and provided that

formula_43

from a theorem due to Titchmarsh.

===Invariance===
The Hilbert transform has the following invariance properties on formula_35.
* It commutes with translations. That is, it commutes with the operators for all in formula_45
* It commutes with positive dilations. That is it commutes with the operators for all .
* It anticommutes with the reflection .

Up to a multiplicative constant, the Hilbert transform is the only bounded operator on 2 with these properties.

In fact there is a wider set of operators that commute with the Hilbert transform. The group formula_46 acts by unitary operators on the space formula_35 by the formula

formula_48
This unitary representation is an example of a principal series representation of formula_49 In this case it is reducible, splitting as the orthogonal sum of two invariant subspaces, Hardy space formula_50 and its conjugate. These are the spaces of boundary values of holomorphic functions on the upper and lower halfplanes. formula_50 and its conjugate consist of exactly those functions with Fourier transforms vanishing on the negative and positive parts of the real axis respectively. Since the Hilbert transform is equal to , with being the orthogonal projection from formula_35 onto formula_53 and the identity operator, it follows that formula_54 and its orthogonal complement are eigenspaces of for the eigenvalues . In other words, commutes with the operators . The restrictions of the operators to formula_54 and its conjugate give irreducible representations of formula_46 – the so-called limit of discrete series representations.

==Extending the domain of definition==

===Hilbert transform of distributions===
It is further possible to extend the Hilbert transform to certain spaces of distributions . Since the Hilbert transform commutes with differentiation, and is a bounded operator on , restricts to give a continuous transform on the inverse limit of Sobolev spaces:

formula_57

The Hilbert transform can then be defined on the dual space of formula_58, denoted formula_59, consisting of distributions. This is accomplished by the duality pairing:
For define:

formula_60

It is possible to define the Hilbert transform on the space of tempered distributions as well by an approach due to Gel&#x27;fand and Shilov, but considerably more care is needed because of the singularity in the integral.

=== Hilbert transform of bounded functions ===
The Hilbert transform can be defined for functions in formula_61 as well, but it requires some modifications and caveats. Properly understood, the Hilbert transform maps formula_61 to the Banach space of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) classes.

Interpreted naïvely, the Hilbert transform of a bounded function is clearly ill-defined. For instance, with , the integral defining diverges almost everywhere to . To alleviate such difficulties, the Hilbert transform of an function is therefore defined by the following regularized form of the integral

formula_63

where as above and

formula_64

The modified transform agrees with the original transform up to an additive constant on functions of compact support from a general result by Calderón and Zygmund. Furthermore, the resulting integral converges pointwise almost everywhere, and with respect to the BMO norm, to a function of bounded mean oscillation.

A deep result of Fefferman&#x27;s work is that a function is of bounded mean oscillation if and only if it has the form for some 

==Conjugate functions==
The Hilbert transform can be understood in terms of a pair of functions and such that the function
formula_65
is the boundary value of a holomorphic function in the upper half-plane. Under these circumstances, if and are sufficiently integrable, then one is the Hilbert transform of the other.

Suppose that formula_66 Then, by the theory of the Poisson integral, admits a unique harmonic extension into the upper half-plane, and this extension is given by

formula_67

which is the convolution of with the Poisson kernel

formula_68

Furthermore, there is a unique harmonic function defined in the upper half-plane such that is holomorphic and
formula_69

This harmonic function is obtained from by taking a convolution with the &quot;conjugate Poisson kernel&quot;

formula_70

Thus
formula_71

Indeed, the real and imaginary parts of the Cauchy kernel are
formula_72

so that is holomorphic by Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula.

The function obtained from in this way is called the harmonic conjugate of . The (non-tangential) boundary limit of as is the Hilbert transform of . Thus, succinctly,
formula_73

=== Titchmarsh&#x27;s theorem ===

Titchmarsh&#x27;s theorem (named for E. C. Titchmarsh who included it in his 1937 work) makes precise the relationship between the boundary values of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane and the Hilbert transform. It gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a complex-valued square-integrable function on the real line to be the boundary value of a function in the Hardy space of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane .

The theorem states that the following conditions for a complex-valued square-integrable function formula_74 are equivalent:

* is the limit as of a holomorphic function in the upper half-plane such that formula_75
* The real and imaginary parts of are Hilbert transforms of each other.
* The Fourier transform formula_76 vanishes for .

A weaker result is true for functions of class for . Specifically, if is a holomorphic function such that

formula_77

for all , then there is a complex-valued function in formula_8 such that in the norm as (as well as holding pointwise almost everywhere). Furthermore,

formula_79

where is a real-valued function in formula_8 and is the Hilbert transform (of class ) of .

This is not true in the case . In fact, the Hilbert transform of an function need not converge in the mean to another function. Nevertheless, the Hilbert transform of does converge almost everywhere to a finite function such that

formula_81

This result is directly analogous to one by Andrey Kolmogorov for Hardy functions in the disc. Although usually called Titchmarsh&#x27;s theorem, the result aggregates much work of others, including Hardy, Paley and Wiener (see Paley–Wiener theorem), as well as work by Riesz, Hille, and Tamarkin

=== Riemann–Hilbert problem ===
One form of the Riemann–Hilbert problem seeks to identify pairs of functions and such that is holomorphic on the upper half-plane and is holomorphic on the lower half-plane, such that for along the real axis,
formula_82

where is some given real-valued function of The left-hand side of this equation may be understood either as the difference of the limits of from the appropriate half-planes, or as a hyperfunction distribution. Two functions of this form are a solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem.

Formally, if solve the Riemann–Hilbert problem
formula_83

then the Hilbert transform of is given by
formula_84

== Hilbert transform on the circle ==

For a periodic function the circular Hilbert transform is defined:

formula_85

The circular Hilbert transform is used in giving a characterization of Hardy space and in the study of the conjugate function in Fourier series. The kernel, 
formula_86
is known as the Hilbert kernel since it was in this form the Hilbert transform was originally studied.

The Hilbert kernel (for the circular Hilbert transform) can be obtained by making the Cauchy kernel periodic. More precisely, for 

formula_87

Many results about the circular Hilbert transform may be derived from the corresponding results for the Hilbert transform from this correspondence.

Another more direct connection is provided by the Cayley transform , which carries the real line onto the circle and the upper half plane onto the unit disk. It induces a unitary map

of onto formula_89 The operator carries the Hardy space onto the Hardy space formula_50.

== Hilbert transform in signal processing ==

=== Bedrosian&#x27;s theorem ===
Bedrosian&#x27;s theorem states that the Hilbert transform of the product of a low-pass and a high-pass signal with non-overlapping spectra is given by the product of the low-pass signal and the Hilbert transform of the high-pass signal, or

formula_91

where and are the low- and high-pass signals respectively. A category of communication signals to which this applies is called the &quot;narrowband signal model.&quot; A member of that category is amplitude modulation of a high-frequency sinusoidal &quot;carrier&quot;:

formula_92

where is the narrow bandwidth &quot;message&quot; waveform, such as voice or music. Then by Bedrosian&#x27;s theorem:

formula_93

=== Analytic representation ===

A specific type of conjugate function is:

formula_94

known as the &quot;analytic representation&quot; of formula_95 The name reflects its mathematical tractability, due largely to Euler&#x27;s formula. Applying Bedrosian&#x27;s theorem to the narrowband model, the analytic representation is:

A Fourier transform property indicates that this complex heterodyne operation can shift all the negative frequency components of above 0 Hz. In that case, the imaginary part of the result is a Hilbert transform of the real part. This is an indirect way to produce Hilbert transforms.

=== Angle (phase/frequency) modulation ===
The form:

formula_96

is called angle modulation, which includes both phase modulation and frequency modulation. The instantaneous frequency is  formula_97  For sufficiently large , compared to 

formula_98
and:
formula_99

=== Single sideband modulation (SSB) ===

When in  is also an analytic representation (of a message waveform), that is:

formula_100

the result is single-sideband modulation:

formula_101

whose transmitted component is:

formula_102

===Causality===
The function formula_103 presents two causality-based challenges to practical implementation in a convolution (in addition to its undefined value at 0):
* Its duration is infinite (technically &quot;infinite support&quot;). Finite-length &quot;windowing&quot; reduces the effective frequency range of the transform; shorter windows result in greater losses at low and high frequencies. See also quadrature filter.
* It is a non-causal filter. So a delayed version, formula_104 is required. The corresponding output is subsequently delayed by formula_105 When creating the imaginary part of an analytic signal, the source (real part) must also be delayed by formula_106.

== Discrete Hilbert transform ==

For a discrete function, formula_107 with discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT), formula_108, and discrete Hilbert transform formula_109 the DTFT of formula_110 in the region is given by:

:formula_111

The inverse DTFT, using the convolution theorem, is:

:formula_112

where

:formula_113

which is an infinite impulse response (IIR).

Practical considerations

Method 1: Direct convolution of streaming formula_114 data with an FIR approximation of formula_115 which we will designate by formula_116 Examples of truncated formula_117 are shown in figures 1 and 2. Fig 1 has an odd number of anti-symmetric coefficients and is called Type III. This type inherently exhibits responses of zero magnitude at frequencies 0 and Nyquist, resulting in a bandpass filter shape. A Type IV design (even number of anti-symmetric coefficients) is shown in Fig 2. It has a highpass frequency response. Type III is the usual choice. for these reasons:
* A typical (i.e. properly filtered and sampled) formula_114 sequence has no useful components at the Nyquist frequency.
* The Type IV impulse response requires a formula_119 sample shift in the formula_117 sequence. That causes the zero-valued coefficients to become non-zero, as seen in &quot;Figure 2&quot;. So a Type III design is potentially twice as efficient as Type IV.
* The group delay of a Type III design is an integer number of samples, which facilitates aligning formula_110 with formula_114 to create an analytic signal. The group delay of Type IV is halfway between two samples.
The abrupt truncation of formula_117 creates a rippling (Gibbs effect) of the flat frequency response. That can be mitigated by use of a window function to taper formula_124 to zero.

Method 2: Piecewise convolution. It is well known that direct convolution is computationally much more intensive than methods like overlap-save that give access to the efficiencies of the Fast Fourier transform via the convolution theorem. Specifically, the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a segment of formula_114 is multiplied pointwise with a DFT of the formula_124 sequence. An inverse DFT is done on the product, and the transient artifacts at the leading and trailing edges of the segment are discarded. Over-lapping input segments prevent gaps in the output stream. An equivalent time domain description is that segments of length formula_127 (an arbitrary parameter) are convolved with the periodic function: 

:formula_128

When the duration of non-zero values of formula_129 is formula_130 the output sequence includes formula_131 samples of formula_132  formula_133 outputs are discarded from each block of formula_134 and the input blocks are overlapped by that amount to prevent gaps.

Method 3: Same as method 2, except the DFT of formula_129 is replaced by samples of the formula_136 distribution (whose real and imaginary components are all just formula_137 or formula_138) That convolves formula_114 with a periodic summation:

:formula_140
for some arbitrary parameter, formula_141 formula_117 is not an FIR, so the edge effects extend throughout the entire transform. Deciding what to delete and the corresponding amount of overlap is an application-dependent design issue.

Fig 3 depicts the difference between methods 2 and 3. Only half of the antisymmetric impulse response is shown, and only the non-zero coefficients. The blue graph corresponds to method 2 where formula_117 is truncated by a rectangular window function, rather than tapered. It is generated by a Matlab function, hilb(65). Its transient effects are exactly known and readily discarded. The frequency response, which is determined by the function argument, is the only application-dependent design issue. 

The red graph is formula_144 corresponding to method 3. It is the inverse DFT of the formula_136 distribution. Specifically, it is the function that is convolved with a segment of formula_114 by the MATLAB function, hilbert(u,512). The real part of the output sequence is the original input sequence, so that the complex output is an analytic representation of formula_147 

When the input is a segment of a pure cosine, the resulting convolution for two different values of formula_127 is depicted in Fig 4 (red and blue plots). Edge effects prevent the result from being a pure sine function (green plot). Since formula_149 is not an FIR sequence, the theoretical extent of the effects is the entire output sequence. But the differences from a sine function diminish with distance from the edges. Parameter formula_127 is the output sequence length. If it exceeds the length of the input sequence, the input is modified by appending zero-valued elements. In most cases, that reduces the magnitude of the edge distortions. But their duration is dominated by the inherent rise and fall times of the formula_117 impulse response.

Fig 5 is an example of piecewise convolution, using both methods 2 (in blue) and 3 (red dots). A sine function is created by computing the Discrete Hilbert transform of a cosine function, which was processed in four overlapping segments, and pieced back together. As the FIR result (blue) shows, the distortions apparent in the IIR result (red) are not caused by the difference between formula_117 and formula_149 (green and red in Fig 3). The fact that formula_149 is tapered (&quot;windowed&quot;) is actually helpful in this context. The real problem is that it&#x27;s not windowed enough. Effectively, formula_155 whereas the overlap-save method needs formula_156

== Number-theoretic Hilbert transform ==
The number theoretic Hilbert transform is an extension of the discrete Hilbert transform to integers modulo an appropriate prime number. In this it follows the generalization of discrete Fourier transform to number theoretic transforms. The number theoretic Hilbert transform can be used to generate sets of orthogonal discrete sequences.

;Notes
* Two all-sports conferences, the Division I Ivy League and Division III Middle Atlantic Conference, officially sponsor ice hockey for both men and women, but neither hold conference tournaments nor compete for their own automatic bids to the NCAA tournament. All of the hockey-sponsoring schools in both leagues are members of hockey-only leagues and compete for those leagues&#x27; automatic bids, with Ivy League members competing in ECAC Hockey and MAC members competing in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference. The Ivies and MAC both extrapolate their own conference champions from results of regular-season games between their own members. 
* The Northeast-10 sponsors a championship for its members that play men&#x27;s ice hockey, but the NCAA doesn&#x27;t currently sponsor a national championship at Division II level for either sex. All members of that conference with women&#x27;s teams participate in the NEWHA.

==Monuments and sightseeings==

Samobor is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, catering to anglers, hunters and hikers. The town&#x27;s beautiful surroundings and vicinity to the capital have supported this tourist tradition to the present day. In 1846, Samobor was paid a visit by the composer Franz Liszt, who at that time was visiting Zagreb during one of his numerous concert tours. Liszt came to Samobor to see his friend Ferdo Livadić, in his lodgings at the Livadić mansion, which is today the town museum.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Livadić mansion came under the ownership of a Jewish family named Daničić. They were forced to leave as a result of the Nazi invasion in 1941. Shortly after this, the mansion was
confiscated by the newly formed Independent State of Croatia and never returned to the Daničić family. On Tepec hill, a 10-minute walk from the city centre, there are still-visible remains of the Samobor Castle fortress built in the 13th century.

However,in the local Kajkavian dialect, &quot;gorica&quot; means &#x27;vineyard&#x27;, hence the city&#x27;s name literally translated is &#x27;big vineyard&#x27;. This is because this area has produced wine since ancient times.

Velika Gorica also has (or had) names in other languages, notably Hungarian &quot;Nagygoricza&quot; and German &quot;Gross-Gorica&quot;.

==Geography==
The City of Velika Gorica, located south of Zagreb, is the centre of an area covering . Up until 1990 Velika Gorica had the status of a municipality and after that it became a part of Zagreb. Velika Gorica gained city status in 1995. The area of the old Municipality of Velika Gorica was split into three municipalities – Kravarsko, Orle and Pokupsko.

Velika Gorica is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of the traditional Turopolje region. Regarding the Turopolje name, among the most common opinions is that the name, meaning &quot;Tur field&quot;, comes from an old Slavic word &quot;tur&quot; which means Aurochs, an ancient type of cattle with long horns, which was a symbol of fertility and the sun god. These cattle died out in the 16th century. The cattle were closely related to agriculture. Plowing had a symbolic meaning, the fertilization of Mother Earth, so these cattle were often assumed to have &quot;sacred&quot; characteristics. Because of its importance in the life of the plowmen, &quot;tur&quot; became the basis for numerous toponyms. However, as recently as the 16th century, Turopolje was called &quot;Campus Zagrebiensis&quot;, i.e. &quot;Zagreb field&quot;, or just &quot;Campus&quot; (field). At that time the name was replaced by &quot;Tur field&quot;, i.e. Turopolje.

The A11 (Zagreb-Sisak) highway is planned to become the western bypass of Velika Gorica. State route D31 will be the eastern bypass. It is planned that these bypasses will relieve the traffic along the overcrowded Velikogorička road, the fastest link between Zagreb and Velika Gorica .

==History==

Velika Gorica and surrounding plain area by the Sava river have always been fertile and lush so it is no wonder it has been constantly inhabited since Neolithic. First major settlement was Andautonia, founded in 1st century where village of Šćitarjevo stands nowadays. It was an important Roman port on Sava river and city on roads connecting Siscia with Emona and Poetovio. The Roman town was large at the beginning of the 5th century.

Croats came to these parts in the 8th century and remains from early Croat culture were found in numerous places around city of Velika Gorica. Velika Gorica is first mentioned in 1228 as a seat of parish. In 1278 noblemen from Turopolje joined into a union called &quot;Plemenita opčina turopoljska&quot; (&quot;Noble municipality of Turopolje&quot;). &quot;Plemenita opčina turopoljska&quot; was granted a rule over Turopolje by Croatian monarchs and exists still today with mainly ceremonial and not political role.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Velika Gorica was a district capital in the Zagreb County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia.

The 20th century was by far the most important one in history of Velika Gorica as it grew from a small village of 2,871 inhabitants to an important and one of the largest cities in Croatia with population over 60 thousand inhabitants. Until 1995 Velika Gorica was part of City of Zagreb and since then it has a city status of its own.

During the Croatian War of Independence the city played an important role because of two airports in its near distance. Velika Gorica&#x27;s 153rd brigade of Croatian Army fought on battlefields all around Croatia.

==Landmarks and sights==
Main Velika Gorica&#x27;s sight is the Turopolje Museum which traces human presence in Turopolje since Neolithic. There are also a number of monuments scattered around the city and its environs.

&quot;Vrata od krča&quot; (&quot;The Timber Gate&quot;) is a unique wooden monument to human labour, risen up in forest near the city. Monument was risen in 1779 as a symbol of reclaiming the fertile land from forest. It was torn down by the flood in 1914 and restored two years later.

Old town Lukavec is a very well preserved fortification first mentioned in 1256 as &quot;Caput Lukavec&quot;. It was built by wood as a defense from Ottoman invasion. It was first owned by Zagreb noblemen and Turopolje noblemen gained control over castle in 1553 when it already became a ruin. It was soon rebuild in stone and became a regular site of assembly of Turopolje noblemen.

Wooden chapels from Turopolje and Pokuplje are unique in the world. They can be traced far back in the early Middle Ages, but most of the preserved ones date from the 17th century. Today there are only 11 preserved wooden chapels left, three in Turopolje, two in Vukomeričke gorice and six in Pokuplje. They were built by groups of timber-workers and as a rule they were made of oak-tree.

There are several small monuments to World War II anti-fascist resistance movement (most famous being &quot;The Bomber Man&quot; in near city center) and also many monuments to Croatian soldiers who fought in Croatian War of Independence. The city has a monument to soldiers from the city who lost their lives in the Croatian War of Independence.

In a competition held among 5,300 European cities, Velika Gorica was awarded the Silver Flower of Europe – an award presented by the European Association for Flowers and Landscape Entente Florale. The award was accepted on 9 September 2004, in the French town of Aix-les-Bains.

==Education==
Velika Gorica has four elementary schools (&quot;Eugen Kvaternik&quot;, &quot;Eugen Kumičić&quot;, &quot;Juraj Habdelić&quot; and &quot;Nikola Hribar&quot;) and four high schools (Vocational School Velika Gorica, Gymnasium Velika Gorica, Economy School of Velika Gorica and Aviation Technical School Rudolf Perešin). In addition, there is a higher education institute, the Velika Gorica University of Applied Sciences.

==Culture==
===People&#x27;s Open University===
Established in 1960, the People&#x27;s Open University (hr: &quot;Pučko otvoreno učilište&quot;, shortform POU) began a phase of rich and complex development in its first home, a building which was previously an inn, and which was situated opposite the present-day building of this institution at 37 Zagrebačka Street. In the year of its establishment the institution as connected with the already existing Public Library, and three years later, in 1963, by the Cinema Company “Prosvjeta”. Together, they conducted their activities in the former House of Cooperatives “Zadružni dom”, where the present administration is situated and a part of the POU&#x27;s activities are still performed today.

By initiating and developing numerous activities the University has spread out to new locations. The most important step was made in 1980, when the Cultural Centre was built, with an art gallery, an additional library and a chamber hall in Galženica, a part of Velika Gorica.

In the late 1980s the University was also using space in the old Secondary School at 5 Zagrebačka Street (the Music School), in the House of Social Protection (&quot;Dom društvene samozaštite&quot;), today’s Fire Brigade building (the radio-station) and in the Podbrežnica settlement (the library). In 1993 the Music School moved to a new building in Kolarova Street where it has remained until the present day.

It was on the premises of the People&#x27;s Open University that many people in Velika Gorica saw their first film or theatre performance, borrowed their first book or attended their first concert or exhibition. There they learned to play their first notes and master the basics of a foreign language. They entered a disco for the first time in their lives. They learned how to drive a car or heard their own voices on a radio station. Some of them, thanks to this broad spectrum of activities, published their first books or displayed their first exhibitions right here.

In recent years, the building of the Open University has been renovated and technically equipped. The philosophy of the institution has been to listen attentively to the needs of the local populace and design programmes in accord with their changing requirements.

Today, the People&#x27;s Open University seeks to satisfy the diverse cultural needs of Velika Gorica&#x27;s citizens through its theatre, gallery, concerts, publishing, cinema and other activities that encourage people to meet and exchange ideas. A great deal was achieved between 2006 and 2010, when actress Senka Bulić served as Head of the POU and brought the University&#x27;s theatre, Scena Gorica, to the attention of the theatre-going public throughout the country. During her tenure Klub 100, a multimedia space for the development of urban culture, was additionally founded and became an important part of the cultural landscape for young people especially.
===Libraries and galleries===
Libraries and reading rooms have a long tradition in Turopolje, since there is a deeply rooted interest in and love for books in this region. The Velika Gorica city library is the descendant of the Reading Room in Velika Gorica, established in 1886. Since October 1999 it has operated independently in two locations: the Central Library at 37 Zagrebačka Street and the Regional Galženica Library at 5 S. Radić Square.

===Turopolje Museum===
Founded in 1960, the Turopolje Museum is concerned with the preservation and promotion of the cultural heritage of the historic Turopolje, Pokuplje, Posavina and Vukomeričke gorice regions. The Museum is housed in a building dating from 1750, which previously served as the city hall of the Noble Commune of Turopolje. It is situated in the centre of Velika Gorica, on the eastern edge of the main park. This two-storey building with a colonnade on the ground floor was built in a Baroque style with elements of the traditional Turopolje architectural style. Assemblies called “spravišća” were once held in the large hall on the upper floor. The rooms next to the hall were archives where the important documents of the Noble Commune were kept. The ground floor at one time housed prison cells. The Museum has a collection comprising some 3,500 objects and over 10,000 photographical records. The Museum library has around 700 volumes on subjects relating to the region&#x27;s history.

===Public monuments===
At the end of the 1970s in particular, moderately intensive development of Velika Gorica&#x27;s city centre and the surrounding districts took place. In an attempt to accommodate the need both for green space and for an aesthetic dimension to development, over the city history a number of parks have been created, most of which contain pieces of public sculpture.

The beginning of the 21st century was most important for urban uprising of Velika Gorica. New central park was created that carries the name of first Croatian president, dr. Franjo Tuđman. Tuđman&#x27;s park soon became one of the most important urban spaces in Velika Gorica.

==Sport==

Sports clubs in Velika Gorica include the football clubs HNK Gorica and NK Udarnik, a men&#x27;s handball club HRK Gorica, a women&#x27;s volleyball club OK Azena and a men&#x27;s basketball club KK Gorica.

HNK Gorica plays its home games at Stadion Radnik, built for 1987 Summer Universiade while NK Udarnik has its own field in Kurilovec neighborhood. Indoor sports are mainly played in the city sports hall. There also three elementary school sports halls in the city that are used by sports clubs for trainings and youth categories.

<text>Zaprešić () is a town in Hrvatsko Zagorje, Zagreb County in Croatia. It has a population of 19,644 inhabitants in the town proper, with 25,223 in the administrative area. The town&#x27;s metropolitan area, which encompasses the seven neighbouring municipalities, has a population of 54,640. Zaprešić is the third-largest, and most densely populated town of the county. It is located northwest of the Croatian capital Zagreb, and near the Slovenian border. It is centered on plains north of the Sava River, and is bordered by Medvednica Mountain to the east, and the Marija Gorica Hills to the west.

The first human settlement in, and near Zaprešić dates from the Neolithic, and several Roman roads were constructed in the area. Vicinity to transport corridors is also reflected in the meaning of the name (&quot;za&quot;, &#x27;near or behind&#x27;, &quot;prešće&quot; &#x27;crossing&#x27;). The first records of the settlement date from 1474. (although, some authors claim that the church of Saint Peter in Zaprešić could have been mentioned in a document supposedly written in 1334). In the late medieval and early modern times, the village history includes being a part of a feudal estate Susedgrad, as well of being a part of Brdovec parish.

During the 19th century the town was operating the first meat packaging plant in Croatia. However, it was not formally established as a town until 1995. The town is governed by a mayor, a town government of seven members (upper house), and a town council of twenty one (lower house). Zaprešić has its own fire department, but police coverage is provided by the City of Zagreb. Komunalno poduzeće Zaprešić manages all utilities except electricity. Tap water in Zaprešić is of high quality.

Due to its many rail, and road transport corridors, Zaprešić has been dubbed the &quot;northwestern gate to Zagreb County&quot;. It lies directly next to the A2 highway connecting Zagreb to Central Europe. It also is adjacent to the main railway leading northwest out of Zagreb. Centered on the tertiary sector, the town&#x27;s economy is booming due to a large population influx.

Zaprešić&#x27;s educational facilities range from kindergartens to centers of higher education. The town is home to four elementary schools, one high school, and two universities. The Zaprešić metropolitan area contains six castles that together make up what is known as the &quot;palace path.&quot; The town also has a museum and an art gallery. The most popular sport in the region is football, and the local team was NK Inter Zaprešić, that used to be a member of the First Football League of Croatia. Other sports are also present in Zaprešić, and the town is home to a golf resort.

== History ==
The first records of human inhabitants in area of what is today Zaprešić can be traced back to the Neolithic, which can be seen by stone axes found in nearby Brdovec, and axes from the Copper Age found in Marija Gorica. Hallstatt culture traces were also uncovered in the area of Sveti Križ. The Romans left their imprints on nearby in the form of the Siscia–Neviodunum–Emona road, which followed Sava River on its left bank through area of what is today Zaprešić, passing near modern settlements.

After a lack of records from the first millennium, Zaprešić was mentioned in written sources in the late 11th century. In 1094, following the formation of the Zagreb Diocese, magnate called Aka, an advisor of the Hungarian-Croatian King Ladislav I, was granted land west and east of the Medvednica Mountain in order to protect the newly formed diocese.

=== Susedgrad-Stubica Seigniory ===

In the 14th century, the area between rivers Krapina and Sutla (where today Zaprešić is located) was under control of ban of Slavonia. Multiple historical sources refer to this part of land as Zakrapina (probably due to it being behind Krapina river in relation to Susedgrad Castle). Zaprešić became part of the Susedgrad–Stubica Seigniory, centered around Susedgrad Castle westernmost banks of Medvednica. The seigniory was at a time a second-largest estate in the Zagreb County. In 1334, the parish church of St. Peter was founded in Zaprešić, marking the first evidence of the modern settlement of Zaprešić. The settlement developed rapidly, which is attributed to its position on trade and transit routes.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, refugees from Lika came to Zaprešić while fleeng the Croatian-Ottoman Wars. Some of these refugees were the so-called Brdovec Franciscans, for whom Lord Zylagy of Susedgrad built an abbey in Marija Gorica. The refugees brought along their Ikavian accent, which was preserved for a long time in some small Zaprešić communities, although the Zaprešić area has historically been Ekavian Kajkavian (yat being or rather than ). The area of Zaprešić and nearby vicinity in the 16th century was known for its vineyards and wine production. The area serfs from Zaprešić and nearby villages took part in famous Peasant revolt of 1573, led by Ambroz Gubec, with some of the serf leaders being from Zaprešić area. Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, for one thinks that Ambroz Gubec himself managed the estate of Jablanovec, part of modern Zaprešić. Another revolt leader was Ilija Gregorić, a resident of Marija Gorica. Another serf captain was Ivan Turković from Zaprešić.

Two years later, the large Susedgrad-Stubica Seigniory started to disintegrate into many small estates owned by members of lower nobility. Dozens of simple diocesan curia houses remained as a consequence of this.

=== Contemporary history ===
In 1862, one of the first railway lines in Croatia: Zidani Most-Zagreb-Sisak - was constructed, and it passed through Zaprešić on its way to Zagreb.

In 1903, Zaprešić railway station was a hotspot of two anti-Hungarian riots caused by Khuen Hedervary&#x27;s magyarization policy and breaking of Croatian–Hungarian Settlement of 1868 by installing Hungarian national symbols on railway objects across Croatia. These demonstrations were part of a wider national movement that swept the country at a time. In both occasions the demonstrations turned into a scuffle with local gendarmes which ended up with several peasants killed and dozens of locals arrested. Peasants that were killed or injured by the gendarmes are traditionally celebrated as a heroes and national martyrs. In their honour, two separate memorial boards were placed on the building of Zaprešić railway station in 1928. and 2003. After the First World War, the oldest meat industry in Croatia, the Industrija mesnih proizvoda, was founded.

Zaprešić was formally established for the first time in 1952, when the Municipality of Zaprešić () was formed. The municipality operated as part of the Zagreb kotar and later City of Zagreb. The Town of Zaprešić (&quot;Grad Zaprešić&quot;) was incorporated on 30 November 1995. On that day, parts of the surrounding municipalities of Pušća, and Hruševec Kupljenski (which was disbanded, leaving only a namesake settlement) and the City of Zagreb were incorporated into a new Town of Zaprešić. The settlement of Merenje came under the jurisdiction of Zaprešić on 17 January 1997.

== Geography ==

Zaprešić is a part of the metropolitan area of Croatia&#x27;s capital and largest city, Zagreb. It is located northwest of Zagreb, lying near the confluence of the Krapina River, and the Sava River. The small Lužnica River marks the western border of Zaprešić. The Zaprešić metropolitan area consists of Zaprešić and seven surrounding municipalities: Bistra, Brdovec, Dubravica, Jakovlje, Luka, Marija Gorica, and Pušća. It is located in the northwestern part of Zagreb County, bordered on the south by the Sava River, on the east by Zagreb and the Medvednica Mountain, and on the west by the Sutla River and the Slovenian border. According to the official website, three distinct geographic areas make up the Zaprešić area: the western part of the Medvednica Mountain, the Marija Gorica Hills and the plains that lie between. The western part of the Medvednica Mountain is fairly lightly inhabited, with no settlements except at the base of the mountain. These include the Bistra municipality and the Zaprešić settlement of Jablanovec. The Marija Gorica Hills are located mainly in the Marija Gorica municipality between the rivers of Krapina, and Sutla. The third area, the plains, is the area where the Zaprešić itself is located. Zaprešić has a lake, Lake Zajarki, situated between the town and the river Sava in the south. It is colloquially known as Bager (Croatian word for excavator). The lake is currently still used as a gravel pit, although it is a known destination for Zaprešić swimmers and beach goers, as well as local people and foreign tourists who do recreational fishing. Fishing activities on lake Zajarki are regulated by Šrd Šaran, Zaprešić. In 2017. the picnic zone was built on eastern side of a big lake which includes barbecue houses and beach volleyball, handball and football fields.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2021 census, the town of Zaprešić has 24,132 inhabitants, a decrease from 2011, 96.82% being Croats, the 2nd largest ethnic group is Serbs at 0.76% followed by Bosniaks at 0.48%.

Religious affiliation in Zaprešić is 81.39% Catholic, followed by 0.87% Orthodox and 5.15% &quot;Other Christians&quot;.

== Economy ==

Due to its accessible location with favorable conditions for expansion, and a very high net migration, and population growth rates (estimated to be 29 persons per 1,000 per year), Zaprešić is expecting an economic boom. Despite the 2007–2008 financial crisis that affected many cities in Croatia, including the capital, the town operates without loans and expects a yearly budget increase in the range of 20 to 30 percent. The tertiary sector is dominant with mainly retailing, and hospitality, and a smaller presence of tourism, as well as souvenir manufacturing and financial services. The secondary sector is also present with ceramic industry (Inker - as of 2006 part of Roca), metalworking (Karbon Nova, Lanac, and Unija metali) and chemical industry (Messer Croatia plin, Montkemija). The primary sector mainly consists of agriculture, and is expected to continue shrinking. There are currently of arable land for agricultural use, but the town&#x27;s general urban plan anticipates an economic shift will lower the amount of agricultural use to by 2015, thus speeding the process of suburbanization started by the expansion of Zagreb. The future of Zaprešić&#x27;s economy is seen in the development of small, and mid-sized businesses, tourism, and food-related industries. The town&#x27;s income tax rate is 12 percent. The town&#x27;s budget in 2008 amounted to HRK 198 million.

Located next to the Krapina River and A2 motorway, the center serves 2.3 million residents in the Zagreb region. It is also the largest in the Zagreb metropolitan area with of gross leasable area. Construction started in late 2007. It was opened in October 2009.

Of these, Oršić and Januševec are in the zeroth category of cultural heritage preservation of UNESCO, Lužnica is in the first category of the Croatian Ministry of Culture, and Laduč and Novi Dvori are in the second category of the Ministry of Culture. Jakovlje palace is not involved in any cultural preservation program. Novi Dvori (also known as Novi Dvori Jelačićevi – New Jelačić Palace) is known for being the residence of Josip Jelačić, one of the most famous Croatian bans. However, before that it was inhabited by five families (the last one being Erdödy) after its construction in 1611 as a simple two-story house.

== Government ==

Despite the settlement of Zaprešić&#x27;s long history, only with the founding of the Town of Zaprešić on 30 November 1995 did it have its own elected representatives. The towns administration includes two tiers of power: a mayor and a town council. The town council is elected each four years. The mayor () has executive power. He is elected directly by the voters. Current Mayor is Željko Turk (Croatian Democratic Union—HDZ, elected in 2006, re-elected 2009, 2013 and 2017), whose deputy&#x27;s are Damir Benčević and Alan Labus. Zaprešić is part of the 1st Croatian electoral district, which consists of western Zagreb, and the Zaprešić metropolitan area.

The town council () has the legislative power over the town. It represents the residents of Zaprešić and manages the town&#x27;s budget, and it is composed of twenty one members with one presiding and two vice-presiding members. 

== Education ==
The Town of Zaprešić provides education ranging from pre-school to higher education. These include four registered kindergartens (stationed on seven locations), four elementary schools, one high school, and one college. Elementary schools located in Zaprešić include Antun Augustinčić, Ljudevit Gaj, and Kupljenovo elementary schools, and a branch of the Bistra elementary school from the Bistra municipality. The Ban Josip Jelačić High School is located on the Franjo Tuđman Square in the northwestern part of the town. Zaprešić has a University of Applied Sciences which offers courses in business and management, named after the Croatian historian and theologian Baltazar Adam Krčelić, and located in the town center on Novak Street.

* Zaprešić Volunteer Fire Department (Dobrovoljno vatrogasno društvo Zaprešić) - volunteer firefighting unit, founded in February 1901. One of the oldest of its kind in Croatia.

== Transport ==

The town is a major transport hub for the area of Zagreb County and Zagreb itself. It is thus known as the &quot;northwestern gate to Zagreb County.&quot; The Zagreb bypass, and the tolled A2 highway (Zagreb–Macelj, toward Austria; part of European Route E59, and pan-European corridor Xa) pass through the eastern part of Zaprešić, providing Zaprešić with highway access at a cloverleaf interchange. The D225 state road is a major arterial road in Zaprešić. It forms the Pavao Lončar and Marshal Tito Streets, leading west towards Brdovec, Marija Gorica and Slovenia, and east towards western Zagreb, Jablanovec, and Stubica. According to the current urban plan, the traffic on the D225 will be re-routed through two bypasses along the northern and western railway lines to clear the center of Zaprešić of 25,000 daily commuters driving on a two-lane road.

Mass transit provides intra-city and inter-city connections in form of bus and rail. Zaprešić is a major railway intersection, with railways leading west to Slovenia (Corridor X), north to Zabok, and Kumrovec (Corridor Xa) and east to the main regional railway hub Zagreb. Croatian Railways services the Zaprešić train station with major interstate trains going to the west, but also with the suburban line Savski Marof–Zagreb Main Station–Dugo Selo. The town is serviced by two bus companies: the regional Zagrebački električni tramvaj (ZET) and local Meštrović prijevoz. ZET operates line 172 to Zaprešić, which starts at the Črnomerec bus terminal in Zagreb and runs every 8 to 15 minutes during day, and at irregular intervals during the night. Lines 176 and 177 run to the Zaprešić suburban municipality of Bistra. Meštrović prijevoz, the main intra-city bus company of Zaprešić, operates bus lines connecting Zaprešić and all municipalities in its metropolitan area.

Zaprešić lies along the left bank of the Sava River, but it does not have any bridges that would connect the town to Samobor, on the other bank, as the nearest bridge is the Podsused bridge, located in the Podsused – Vrapče district of Zagreb. However, two ferries connect Zaprešić with the roads in Medsave and Samoborski Otok, small villages near Samobor. The widest river in the area, the Sava River, used to be navigable up to Krško, Slovenia in Roman times. However, it is, , navigable only up to Rugvica, leaving Zaprešić with no more possibility of river transport. The town does not have a port on any of its rivers.

To establish better transport capabilities, and create a solid ground for the emerging air sports that are already available in the town (e.g. hang gliding or paragliding), an airport is planned northeast of the town, between the Krapina River and the railroad. The land at this location is unused, uninhabited, and administratively selected for sports and recreation. The arrangement of the runways, taxiways, air traffic control building, hangar, and other necessary buildings have already been determined. The airport is intended to serve primarily as a sports airport, for teaching flying, and for charter flights. the date when the construction starts had not yet been announced.

<text> (), commonly known as Benfica, is a professional football club based in Lisbon, Portugal, that competes in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football.

Founded on 28 February 1904, as &quot;Sport Lisboa&quot;, Benfica is one of the &quot;Big Three&quot; clubs in Portugal that have never been relegated from Primeira Liga, along with rivals Sporting CP and FC Porto. Benfica are nicknamed (The Eagles), for the symbol atop the club&#x27;s crest, and (The Reds), for the shirt colour. Since 2003, their home ground has been the Estádio da Luz, which replaced the larger, original one, built in 1954. Benfica is the most supported Portuguese club and the European club with the highest percentage of supporters in its own country, having an estimated 14 million supporters worldwide and over 390,000 members, making them the largest sports club in the world by membership. The club&#x27;s anthem, &quot;Ser Benfiquista&quot;, refers to Benfica supporters, who are called . &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (&quot;Out of many, one&quot;) is the club&#x27;s motto; Águia Vitória, the mascot.

With 87 major trophies won, Benfica is one of the two most decorated clubs in Portugal. They have won 84 domestic trophies: a record 38 Primeira Liga titles, a record 26 Taça de Portugal, a record 8 Taça da Liga, 9 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and 3 Campeonato de Portugal. Internationally, they won the Latin Cup in 1950 and back-to-back European Cups in 1961 and 1962 – both unique feats in Portuguese football – and were runners-up at the Intercontinental Cup in 1961 and &#x27;62, at the European Cup in 1963, &#x27;65, &#x27;68, &#x27;88 and &#x27;90, and at the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) in 1983, 2013 and &#x27;14. Benfica&#x27;s ten European finals are a domestic record and ranked seventh all-time among UEFA clubs in 2014. Noncompetitively, Benfica is honoured with the Portuguese Orders of Christ (Commander), of Merit (Officer), and of Prince Henry.

Benfica was voted 12th in FIFA Club of the Century and ranked 9th in the IFFHS Top 200 European clubs of the 20th century. In UEFA, Benfica is 8th in the all-time club ranking and was 20th in the club coefficient rankings at the end of the 2023–24 season. In the UEFA Champions League (formerly the European Cup), Benfica have the second most participations (42) and are the Portuguese club with the most wins (130). In this tournament, they hold the overall record for the biggest aggregate win, achieved in 1965–66. Moreover, Benfica hold the European record for the most consecutive wins in domestic league (29), where they became the first undefeated champions, in 1972–73.

==History==
===1904–1960===

On 28 February 1904, after a football training session that day, the Catataus Group and members of Associação do Bem met at Farmácia Franco on &quot;Rua Direita de Belém&quot; with the goal of forming a social and cultural football club called &quot;Sport Lisboa&quot;, composed of Portuguese players only. Twenty-four people attended the meeting, including Cosme Damião. In that meeting, José Rosa Rodrigues was appointed club president, along with Daniel dos Santos Brito as secretary and Manuel Gourlade as treasurer. The founders decided that the club&#x27;s colours would be red and white and that the crest would be composed of an eagle, the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; and a football. Sport Lisboa played their first ever match on 1 January 1905, scoring their first goal. Despite important victories, such as the ones against Carcavelos and then-rivals Internacional, the club suffered from poor operating conditions, namely the football dirt field of Terras do Desembargador. As a result, eight players moved to Sporting CP in May 1907, threatening Sport Lisboa&#x27;s existence, and later starting the rivalry between the two clubs.

On 13 September 1908, Sport Lisboa acquired Grupo Sport Benfica by mutual agreement and changed its name to . Despite the merger, they continued their respective club operations. For Sport Lisboa, they maintained the football team, the shirt colours, the eagle symbol and the motto. For Grupo Sport Benfica, they maintained the field Campo da Feiteira, the main directors and the club&#x27;s house. Both clubs determined that the foundation date should coincide with Sport Lisboa&#x27;s because it was the most recognized club and quite popular in Lisbon due to its football merits. In regard to the crest, a bicycle wheel was added to Sport Lisboa&#x27;s to represent cycling, the most important sport of Grupo Sport Benfica. Furthermore, the two entities of the newly named club had simultaneous members who helped stabilize operations, which later increased the success of the merger.

However, problems with the club&#x27;s rented field (Campo da Feiteira) remained. Benfica moved to their first football grass field, Campo de Sete Rios, in 1913. Four years later, after refusing an increase in rent, they relocated to Campo de Benfica. Finally, in 1925, they moved to their own stadium, the Estádio das Amoreiras, playing there fifteen years before moving to the Estádio do Campo Grande in 1940. The Portuguese league began in 1934, and after finishing third in its first edition, Benfica won the next three championships in a row (1935–36, &#x27;36–37, &#x27;37–38) – the club&#x27;s first &quot;tri&quot;, achieved by Lippo Hertzka. Throughout the 1940s, Benfica would win three more Primeira Liga (1941–42, &#x27;42–43, &#x27;44–45) and four Taça de Portugal (1940, &#x27;43, &#x27;44, &#x27;49), with coach János Biri achieving the first double for the club in 1943.

Benfica&#x27;s first international success happened in 1950, when they won the Latin Cup (the only Portuguese club to do so), defeating Bordeaux with a golden goal from Julinho at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, with Ted Smith as coach. It was the first international trophy won by a Portuguese club. They reached another final of the competition in 1957 but lost to Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu. With the election of president Joaquim Ferreira Bogalho in 1952 and the arrival of coach Otto Glória in 1954, Benfica became more modernized and professional and moved into the original Estádio da Luz, with an initial seating capacity of 40,000; expanded to 70,000 in 1960. During the 1950s, Benfica won three Primeira Liga titles (1949–50, &#x27;54–55, &#x27;56–57) and six Taça de Portugal (1951, &#x27;52, &#x27;53, &#x27;55, &#x27;57, &#x27;59). Despite being Portuguese champions in 1955, Benfica were not invited to the inaugural European Cup by the organizers, thus making their UEFA debut in 1957–58 against Sevilla.

===1960–2003===
Led by coach Béla Guttmann, who had been signed by Maurício Vieira de Brito, Benfica became back-to-back European Champions by winning the European Cup against Barcelona in 1961 (3–2) and Real Madrid in 1962 (5–3). Consequently, Benfica played in the Intercontinental Cup, where they were runners-up to Peñarol in 1961 and Santos in 1962. Later on, Benfica reached three more European Cup finals, losing them to AC Milan in 1963, Inter Milan in 1965, and Manchester United in 1968. Therefore, for their international performance, Benfica were ranked first in European football in 1965, &#x27;66 and &#x27;69, and were presented with the &quot;France Football&quot; European Team of the Year award in 1968. In the 1960s, Benfica won eight Primeira Liga (1959–60, &#x27;60–61, &#x27;62–63, &#x27;63–64, &#x27;64–65, &#x27;66–67, &#x27;67–68, &#x27;68–69), three Taça de Portugal (1962, &#x27;64, &#x27;69) and two European Cups (1960–61, &#x27;61–62). Many of these successes were achieved with Eusébio – the only player to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or for a Portuguese club – Coluna, José Águas, José Augusto, Simões, Torres, and others, who formed the 1963–64 team that set a club record of 103 goals in 26 league matches.

During the 1970s, with president Borges Coutinho, Benfica continued dominating Portuguese football, as they won six Primeira Liga titles (1970–71, &#x27;71–72, &#x27;72–73, &#x27;74–75, &#x27;75–76, &#x27;76–77) and two Taça de Portugal (1970, &#x27;72). In 1971–72, Benfica reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they were eliminated by Ajax of Johan Cruyff. Led by Jimmy Hagan the following season, Benfica became the first club in Portugal to win the league without defeat, winning 28 matches – 23 consecutively – out of 30, and drawing 2. They scored 101 goals, and Eusébio was again crowned Europe&#x27;s top scorer, 2 goals short of his record (42). From October 1976 to September 1978, Benfica were unbeaten in the league for 56 matches. This decade was also marked by Benfica&#x27;s admission of foreign players into the team, becoming the last Portuguese club to do so, in 1979.

In the 1980s, Benfica continued to thrive domestically. With Lajos Baróti in 1980–81, Benfica became the first club to win all Portuguese trophies in one season: Supertaça de Portugal, Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal. Later, under the guidance of Sven-Göran Eriksson, they won two consecutive Primeira Liga (1982–83, &#x27;83–84), one Taça de Portugal (1983) and reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 1983, lost to Anderlecht. Following improvements to the Estádio da Luz, Benfica opened the stadium&#x27;s third tier in 1985, transforming it into the largest stadium in Europe and third largest in the world. A season later, after they had won the domestic Super Cup in 1985 and the Portuguese Cup in 1986, Benfica clinched the double of Primeira Liga and Taça de Portugal. Then, from 1988 to 1994, Benfica won three Primeira Liga (1988–89, &#x27;90–91, &#x27;93–94), one Taça de Portugal (1993), one Super Cup (1989) and reached the European Cup finals of 1988 and 1990, won by PSV Eindhoven and AC Milan respectively.

Financial trouble in the early 1980s and a large investment on players throughout that decade started to deteriorate the club&#x27;s finances under Jorge de Brito&#x27;s presidency. The rampant spending and a questionable signing policy (over 100 players during Manuel Damásio&#x27;s term) further aggravated the problem. Soon after, with president João Vale e Azevedo, Benfica was in huge debt and sometimes unable to pay taxes and player salaries. From 1994 to 2003, Benfica had eleven coaches, won the 1995–96 Taça de Portugal, suffered their biggest defeat in European competitions, 7–0 to Celta de Vigo in 1999, had their lowest ever league finish, a sixth place in 2000–01, and were absent from European competition in 2001–02 and &#x27;02–03, the first time since 1958–59. Back in 2000, club members had approved the construction of the new Estádio da Luz shortly after the election of Manuel Vilarinho.

===2003–present===

In 2003–04, with president Luís Filipe Vieira, Benfica ended their longest silverware drought by winning the Taça de Portugal. The following year, Benfica won their first league title since 1994, and the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. After that and until 2009, when Benfica won their first Taça da Liga – thus becoming the first club to win all major Portuguese competitions – they did not win any trophies and finished fourth in the 2007–08 league. In Europe, Benfica had three consecutive appearances in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, with their best result being a quarter-final stage in 2005–06 after eliminating then European champions Liverpool on 3–0 aggregate.

For 2009–10, Jorge Jesus was appointed coach, a position he held until 2015. During that six-season span, Benfica won 10 domestic trophies, including an unprecedented treble in Portuguese football (league, cup and league cup) in 2013–14 and the club&#x27;s first back-to-back league titles since 1984. At international level, Benfica were ranked sixth in the UEFA team ranking in 2015 due to their first European semi-final in 17 years at the 2010–11 Europa League, an appearance in the Champions League quarter-finals in the 2011–12 campaign, and two consecutive Europa League finals, in 2012–13 and &#x27;13–14.

Later managed by Rui Vitória, Benfica won a fourth Primeira Liga title in a row – their first ever  – one Taça de Portugal, one Taça da Liga and two successive Super Cup trophies; the latter in 2017 after they reachieved a 36-year-old treble. Internationally, a year after they had consecutively reached the Champions League knockout phase for the first time in their history, Benfica suffered their biggest loss in the competition, 5–0 to Basel, and went on setting the worst Portuguese group stage campaign.

Following negative results in 2018–19, coach Bruno Lage led Benfica to their 37th champions title while achieving the league&#x27;s all-time best second round. Later on, after thrashing Sporting CP in the Super Cup, Jesus returned for 2020–21 as part of the biggest spending in Portuguese football, amid the COVID-19 pandemic; they were eliminated in the Champions League third qualifying round, lost a Super Cup match, finished third in the league, and lost a Portuguese Cup final for a second time in a row. From 2021–22 to &#x27;22–23, with president Rui Costa, Benfica lost a league cup final for the first time and were third in the league before coach Roger Schmidt led them to their 38th league title and a second consecutive place in the Champions League quarter-finals.

==Crest and shirt==

Benfica&#x27;s crest is composed of an eagle, as a symbol of independence, authority and nobility, positioned atop a shield with red and white colours, symbolizing bravery and peace respectively; the motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (&quot;Out of many, one&quot;), defining union between all members; and the club&#x27;s initials, &quot;SLB&quot;, over a football – all this superimposed on a bicycle wheel representing one of the club&#x27;s first sports, cycling.

The club has had four main crests since its inception in 1904. The origin of the current crest goes back to 1908, when Sport Lisboa absorbed Grupo Sport Benfica. Afterwards, the shape of the crest was changed in 1930 and 1999. The most significant of the latest changes were the modification and repositioning of the eagle and the reduction of the wheel&#x27;s size.

Since the 2008–09 season, Benfica football shirts have displayed three stars above the crest, with each star representing ten league titles won by the club. In 2010–11 and 2011–12, however, the shirts displayed commemorative crests with one and two stars respectively, the former in the 50-year celebration of their first European Cup and the latter to celebrate their second consecutive European Cup.

José da Cruz Viegas was the person responsible for the selection of Benfica&#x27;s kit in 1904. Red and white colours were chosen for being the ones that stood out better to players&#x27; eyes. One year after its inception, the club opted for red shirts with white collars, pockets and cuffs, combined with white shorts and black socks. Benfica&#x27;s white alternative kit was officially used for the first time in 1944–45, when Salgueiros, who also wore red, were promoted to the first division.

Benfica have always worn red shirts; for that reason, in Portugal, Benfica and their supporters () were nicknamed (Reds). This changed in 1936 with the start of the Spanish Civil War: the Portuguese Estado Novo&#x27;s Censorship Commission censored the word &quot;&quot; because the Popular Front communists in Spain were also known by that name. From then on, Benfica became known as  – word similar to &quot;reds&quot;, but with a different connotation.

==Grounds==

During the club&#x27;s first decades, Benfica played mostly on rented fields. Their first own stadium was the Estádio das Amoreiras, built and opened in 1925, where they played until 1940. A year later, they moved to the Estádio do Campo Grande, a rented municipal stadium, before relocating to their second home ground thirteen years later.

From 1954 to 2003, Benfica played at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, the largest stadium in Europe and third largest in the world in terms of capacity – 120,000 – from 1985 to 1987. It was demolished between 2002 and 2003, and the new Estádio da Luz was finalized in 2003, with a construction cost of €162 million, roughly €25 million more than planned.

Like its predecessor, the Estádio da Luz is officially named Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica. A UEFA category four stadium, it hosted several matches of UEFA Euro 2004, including the final, and was the venue for the UEFA Champions League finals in 2014 and 2020. Built with a seating capacity of 65,647, the stadium currently has 64,642 seats.
===Training centre===

Benfica&#x27;s training ground and youth academy, Benfica Campus, is located in Seixal, Lisbon Region. It was built in 2005 and opened on 22 September 2006.

Benfica is the most popular club in Portugal and has always been seen as the working-class club of Portugal.

In the 2022–23 season, Benfica had an average home attendance of 57,108 in the Portuguese league, the highest average of the competition and current record at the Estádio da Luz, with an average occupancy of 89.12%. The highest home attendance record was set in 2016–17; 64,519 spectators saw Benfica&#x27;s 5–0 win over Vitória de Guimarães in the season&#x27;s last match at Da Luz.

Benfica members may also participate and vote in general assemblies, submit proposals, take part in discussions, be elected to governing bodies, be designated for positions or functions at the club, and so forth.

In 2003, the club implemented electronic voting – a voting method that has been criticized by members of Benfica, including presidential candidates, and outsiders – and since 2010 only people with 25 years of continuous membership as an adult – that is, effective members aged at least 43 – can run for president of Benfica.

In addition, a delegate can also vote: when representing a Benfica house, 50 votes; a filliation or a delegation, 20 votes.

On 9 November 2006, Benfica set the Guinness World Record for &quot;the most widely supported football club&quot;, with 160,398 paid-up members. In 2014, according to a study by Movimento Por Um Futebol Melhor, Benfica had 270,000 members and was the biggest club in the world in membership terms. On 31 March 2015, Benfica reported having 246,401 members. After a scheduled renumbering (done at least every ten years) by the club in August 2015, the number decreased to 156,916. By 9 October 2021, Benfica had over 250,000 members, of which 115,681 were eligible to vote in club elections that day. With 392,202 members in February 2025, Benfica became once again the largest sports club in the world by membership.

===Rivalries===

Benfica has rivalries with Sporting CP and FC Porto, with whom it forms the &quot;Big Three&quot;, Portugal&#x27;s most decorated clubs. None of them have been relegated from the Portuguese league since its establishment in 1934.

As Lisbon-based clubs, Benfica and Sporting have shared a rivalry for over a century; it all started in 1907, when eight prominent Benfica players defected to Sporting. Any match between both teams is known as (&quot;Lisbon derby&quot;), (&quot;eternal derby&quot;), , or (&quot;derby of the derbies&quot;). It is the most important football derby in Portugal and is followed in Europe, Africa, the Americas, and wherever the Portuguese diaspora is.

The rivalry between Benfica and FC Porto, which started with a friendly match on 28 April 1912, comes about as Lisbon and Porto are the largest Portuguese cities, respectively. Benfica and Porto are the two most decorated clubs in Portuguese football, with the former historically being the most decorated team overall. Any match between the two sides is called (The Classic).

==Media==

In 2008, Benfica launched its own sports-oriented television network, Benfica TV (BTV for short), the first channel by a Portuguese club, and has operated it since. Its premium channel broadcasts Benfica&#x27;s live matches at home in the Primeira Liga, Benfica B home matches in the LigaPro, under-19 team home matches, and the club&#x27;s other sports matches, including youth categories. Until 2016, it broadcast three seasons of the English Premier League, and one season of the Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1. In January 2020, Benfica launched Benfica Play (BPlay for short), an over-the-top media service featuring exclusive content such as interviews with current and former Benfica players and behind-the-scenes video from matchdays and training sessions.

Moreover, the club publishes the weekly newspaper every Friday since 28 November 1942. It contains information about everything in the club in the form of news and articles (mostly the former). By 2005, it had a circulation of close to 10,000. From 6 December 2007 to 11 July 2017, Benfica published the quarterly magazine . Free of charge for Benfica members, it comprised interviews with players and personnel of the club, reports about the club&#x27;s history and recent events, news, opinion pieces, overviews of the club&#x27;s sports, with football being its main focus, and a section dedicated to club members. Its last edition, number 33, had a circulation of 115,602 in mainland Portugal. was the club&#x27;s first magazine; it was launched on 1 October 1957 as a monthly supplement to the newspaper .

==Museum==
The Museu Benfica – Cosme Damião, located near the stadium, was inaugurated on 26 July 2013 and opened to the public three days later. Named after Cosme Dasmião, one of the club&#x27;s founders, it was considered the Best Portuguese Museum of 2014 by the Portuguese Association of Museology.

==Finances and ownership==
On 10 February 2000, under the presidency of João Vale e Azevedo, Benfica created Sport Lisboa e Benfica – Futebol, SAD (a public limited sports company) with an initial equity of €75 million. There were five major reasons for creating an autonomous entity to manage the Benfica team: participation in professional football competitions at domestic and international level; development of football players; exploitation of TV rights on open and closed channels; management of the players&#x27; image rights; exploitation of the Benfica brand by the professional football team and at sporting events.

Benfica SAD entered the PSI-20 on 21 May 2007 with an initial stock value of €5 on 15,000,001 shares. Later in June that year, Joe Berardo launched an unsuccessful takeover bid of €3.50 per share for 60% of Benfica SAD. Following the general assembly of 23 December 2009, the SAD increased its €75 million equity to €115 million by absorbing Benfica Estádio, to come out of technical insolvency.

On 31 July 2014, the SAD completed the acquisition of Benfica Stars Fund by spending roughly €28.9 million for 85% of units, thus purchasing the remaining economic rights of nine players. Later in April, Benfica and Adidas renewed their previous ten-season contract of 2003 until 2021, for around €4.5 million per year. In May 2015, Emirates airline signed a three-year sponsorship deal worth up to €30 million to become Benfica&#x27;s main jersey sponsor. Then in December, Benfica sold the TV rights of their first-team home matches as well as Benfica TV&#x27;s broadcasting and distribution rights to NOS in a three-year deal, receiving €40 million per season, with the option to extend the contract to a maximum of ten seasons, totalling €400 million. Days later, Luís Filipe Vieira said the money from the latter contract would be used to lower Benfica&#x27;s debt.

By June 2017, Benfica had earned €617 million from player transfers since the 2010–11 season, more than any other club in the world. In September 2018, Benfica SAD reported a profit of €20.6 million and a revenue of €206.2 million. Moreover, they reported a record equity of €86.8 million: assets of €485.1 million and liabilities of €398.3 million. It was the first time since 2010–11 that the debt was below €400 million. In January 2019, Benfica remained the only Portuguese club ever to appear in the Deloitte Football Money League, being ranked as the world&#x27;s 30th highest commercial revenue generating football club in 2017–18, with a revenue of €150.7 million. In May 2019, Benfica was ranked by Brand Finance as the 40th most valuable football brand.

In May 2020, the Portuguese Securities Market Commission denied Benfica&#x27;s takeover bid of 28.06% of Benfica SAD for €5 a share because the funding source was the SAD itself. By September 2021, Benfica owned the majority of the SAD&#x27;s share capital, 63.65%, of which 40% belonged directly to the club, holder of all category A shares, and 23.65% to its holding company, Benfica SGPS, holder of category B shares. The remaining percentage pertains to shareholders who may only own B shares.

<text>The Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (), mostly just known as the Memorial Church (German: &quot;Gedächtniskirche&quot; ) is a Protestant church affiliated with the Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia, a regional body of the Protestant Church in Germany. It is located in Berlin on the Kurfürstendamm in the centre of the Breitscheidplatz.

The original church on the site was built in the 1890s. It was badly damaged in a bombing raid in 1943. The present building, which consists of a church with an attached foyer and a separate belfry with an attached chapel, was built between 1959 and 1963. The damaged spire of the old church has been retained and its ground floor has been made into a memorial hall.

The Memorial Church today is a famous landmark of western Berlin, and is nicknamed by Berliners &quot;der hohle Zahn&quot;, meaning &quot;the hollow tooth&quot;.

== Old church ==
The construction of the church was part of a Protestant church-building programme initiated by Kaiser Wilhelm II and his consort Augusta Victoria to counter the German labour movement and socialist movement by a return to traditional religious values. Wilhelm II decided to name the church in honor of his grandfather Kaiser Wilhelm I. The competition for the design was won by Franz Schwechten, member of the Bauakademie who had distinguished himself with the design of the Anhalter Bahnhof. Schwechten, a native Rhinelander, planned for a large church to be built in a Neo-Romanesque style modelled on the Bonn Minster with a Tuff stone facade. His design included of wall mosaic, a -high spire (now 71 metres, or 233 ft) and a nave which seated over 2,000 people.

The foundation stone was laid on 22 March 1891, which was Wilhelm I&#x27;s birthday. The church was dedicated on 1 September 1895, the eve of the Day of Sedan. At that time, the entrance hall in the lower section had not yet been completed; that part of the church was not opened and consecrated until 22 February 1906. Construction costs mounted to 6.8 million gold mark, raised primarily through donations. The church design, quite unfamiliar in the Brandenburg region, inspired several architectural projects in the surrounding area, like the &quot;Romanisches Café&quot; building, also designed by Schwechten.

In World War II, on the night of 23 November 1943, the church was extensively damaged in an air raid. Yet it was by no means beyond repair. A remnant of the spire and much of the entrance hall survived intact, as did the altar and the baptistry. After the war, in 1947, the curatorium of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche foundation (Stiftung) decided in favor of rebuilding the church, but the manner in which this should be done was contentiously debated until the late 1950s. In a two-phased design competition in 1956, the question of whether the secured remnant of the spire should be torn down or preserved was left open. The winner of the competition, architect Egon Eiermann, initially proposed, in both his submissions, for the remnant of the old spire to be torn down, in favor of a completely new construction. But that plan provoked a public outcry in which the ruined tower was characterized as the &quot;heart of Berlin&quot;; as a result Eiermann revised the design to preserve the tower. He had most of the remaining structure pulled down, in order to build the modern church that now occupies most of the site.

== New church ==
The new church was designed by Eiermann and consists of four buildings grouped around the remaining ruins of the old church. The initial design included the demolition of the spire of the old church but following pressure from the public, it was decided to incorporate it into the new design. The four buildings comprise, on the west of the ruins, the new church with a foyer to its west, and to the east of the ruins, a tower with a chapel to its northeast. The plan of the church is octagonal while the plan of the tower is hexagonal. These components are sited on a plateau measuring 100 metres long and 40 metres wide. The new buildings are constructed of concrete, steel and glass. The walls of the church are made of a concrete honeycomb containing 21,292 stained glass inlays. The glass, designed by Gabriel Loire, was inspired by the colours of the glass in Chartres Cathedral. The predominant colour is blue, with small areas of ruby red, emerald green and yellow. The church is 35 metres in diameter and 20.5 metres high with a capacity of over 1,000. Because of the distinctive appearance of the new buildings, it is sometimes nicknamed (the lipstick and the powder box) by Berliners.

Inside the church, opposite the entrance, a figure of the resurrected Christ is suspended above the altar. This is made from tombak and was designed by Karl Hemmeter. The cross on the altar, by Peter Tauchnitz, is of gilt silver with 37 rock crystals. To the left of the altar is the baptismal font on a stand filled with Carrara marble which contains a majolica bowl for the holy water. To the right of the altar is an octagonal pulpit. Opposite the altar on a gallery is an organ containing about 5,000 pipes, which was built by Karl Schuke. Plexiglas panels have been installed over the organ gallery to improve the acoustics. By the northeast wall of the church are three works of art. The first is a bronze plaque commemorating the Protestant martyrs who died during the Nazi regime between 1933 and 1945. It incorporates a Spanish wooden crucifix dating from the 13th century. The plaque was placed in the church on 20 July 1964, the 20th anniversary of an attempt to assassinate Hitler. Next to this is the &quot;Stalingrad Madonna&quot;, a symbol of hope and reconciliation. This is a charcoal drawing made by Kurt Reuber during the time he was trapped inside Stalingrad at Christmas 1942. Copies of this drawing have been sent to Coventry Cathedral and the Russian Orthodox Church in Stalingrad (now Volgograd). The third item of art is an icon of the Virgin Mary from Volgograd.

The tower is 12 metres in diameter and 53.5 metres high with a flat roof. Atop the tower is a pole carrying a gilded sphere above which is a gilded cross. It contains a belfry with six bronze bells cast from French cannon, booty from the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. The foundation stone of the new church was laid on 9 May 1959, its roofing ceremony was carried out on 16 December 1960, the new bells were consecrated on 19 July 1961, the new church was consecrated on 17 December 1961 and the foyer and chapel were completed in December 1963.
==Bells of the new church==

In 1894, Kaiser Wilhelm II donated 50,000 pounds of bronze from captured cannons to cast a new bell for the church. Five bells were made in the same year in the Franz Schilling court bell foundry in Apolda. When it was completed, the bell was the largest of its kind in Germany. The largest bell or bourdon is named Queen Luise &amp; Kaiser Wilhelm I and it weighs 13,230 kg. When the bells arrived in Berlin on 1 June 1895, they were driven through the city in a ceremonial procession and consecrated on 18 June by General Superintendent Faber. Before a bell was installed around 1900, around 20 bell ringers were needed to get the whole bell ringing. After World War II the bells were free, but a few decades later they were no longer so lucky. Between 1942 and 1943 the larger bells were smashed, while the smallest was allowed to remain on the tower as a ringing bell. When the church went down in a hail of bombs in November 1943, the last remaining bell was severely damaged. In 1949 they were sent back to Apolda. The bell&#x27;s further fate is unknown, but it can be assumed that it was melted down. However, the ruins of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church were not to remain entirely without bells. In 1954, three iron bells were ordered from the Franz Weeren iron works, which were to serve as clock strike bells from then on. For a long time they did not do their job, because in the course of the new construction of the church a correspondingly representative ringing was desired. In 1960 the time had come: at the Rincker bell and art foundry in Sinn, a 6-part bell and a carillon were created for the old tower. Two of the three iron bells came to Berlin-Neukölln; what happened to the third is unknown. On 19 July 1961 the new bells and the newly built campanile were inaugurated and put into operation. The bell&#x27;s sound is affected by its clearly progressive rib, and from the tower&#x27;s acoustics. The bells were inscribed with bible verses.

Different bells are rung on different occasions:
*Devotions, family worship, baptisms and marriages: Bells 6, 5 and 4
*Organ Vespers and funerals: Bells 6, 5, 4 and 3
*Sunday worship: Bells 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2
*Festive services: All bells (6–1)

==Spire and memorial hall==
The entrance hall in the base of the damaged spire was reopened to visitors, having been consecrated on 7 January 1987. Its floor contains a mosaic of the Archangel Michael fighting the dragon. The vault shows a procession of Hohenzollern princes, designed by Hermann Schaper, and includes a depiction of Crown Prince Wilhelm who never became king after his father, Wilhelm II, abdicated the throne in 1918. Other mosaics show important monarchs in medieval Germany, Reformation thinkers and Reformation princes. Bas-relief sculptures illustrate scenes from biblical stories (Jacob wrestling with the angel, Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, and the pietà), scenes from the life of Kaiser Wilhelm I and symbolic figures representing war and peace. In the north apse are 16 display panels which tell the story of the old church and its destruction. At the opposite end of the hall are three items which symbolise the history of the church. In the middle is a damaged statue of Christ which originally stood on the altar of the old church. To its right is the Cross of Nails which was made from nails in the roof timbers of Coventry Cathedral, which had been severely damaged in a German air raid on 14 November 1940. To the left of the statue of Christ is an icon cross which was given by the Russian Orthodox Church and handed over in 1988. Outside the hall are four sandstone figures made by Stefan Kaehne.

In December 2007, Charles Jeffrey Gray, a former British pilot who carried out World War II bombing raids over Germany, joined a campaign to rescue the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church from decay. After reading about the condition of the Church, Gray contacted Wolfgang Kuhla, the chairman of the church&#x27;s advisory board, urging that its tower be restored. In response, a fund was launched to help raise the costs of its repair.

<text>The British Rail Class 04 is a 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical shunting locomotive class, built between 1952 and 1962 and was the basis for the later Class 03 built in the British Railways workshops.

==History==
The prototype locomotive was built in 1947 and served as a departmental shunter at Hither Green depot as number DS1173, before being transferred to the capital stock list as D2341 in 1967.

The Class 04 locomotives were supplied by the Drewry Car Co., which at the time (and for most of its existence) had no manufacturing capability. Drewry sub-contracted the construction work to two builders both of whom built other locomotives under the same arrangement. Early locomotives which became D2200-41 (including DS1173) were built by Vulcan Foundry in 1952–56, and later examples D2242-2339 were built by Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns in 1956–61.

=== Design evolution ===
A clear line of development can be seen in the Class 04 from the 0-4-0DM locomotives built by Andrew Barclay and Drewry/Vulcan Foundry in the early 1940s. Similar 0-6-0DM locomotives had been built before the first Class 04, and others were built for industrial use.

The design continued to develop during the construction period, although this was generally confined to minor changes, including the diameter of the wheels.

The first batch (four engines numbered 11100-11103, later D2200-D2203) were equipped for street-running (see below).

The second batch (six engines numbered 11105-11110, later D2204-D2209) were fitted with conical exhaust stacks (the first batch initially had a plain exhaust &quot;hole&quot;, later having a long, thin, and straight exhaust pipe added) and shaped cab front windows (instead of the rectangular windows of the first batch); these changes continued on all subsequent batches.

From the fourth batch (commencing with 11121, later D2215) the small cab side window of the earlier batches was replaced with a much larger window, the rear half of which slid open. The wheel diameter was also increased from 3 ft 3 in to 3 ft 6 in.

From locomotive D2274 onwards, the wheel diameter was again increased, from 3 ft 6 in to 3 ft 7 in. The front running plate was cut out and the steps inset to provide a safer location for a shunter riding on the locomotive; to facilitate this, the locomotive straight air brake reservoir tank was relocated underneath the centre of the running plate. This is the version depicted by the Airfix/Dapol plastic kit.

===Use on tramways===
The first four of these locomotives (11100-11103, later D2200-D2203) were fitted with side skirting and cowcatchers for use on the Wisbech and Upwell Tramway and on the Yarmouth Docks tramway system, since British law requires locomotives running on unfenced street trackage to be so equipped for the protection of pedestrians and animals. At least two later engines (11111/D2210 and 11113/D2212) were also fitted with cowcatchers and skirting for use on the Ipswich docks tramway system.

===Usage===
The class was distributed throughout the British Railways system, but the significant decline in the traffic for which they were designed resulted in a large surplus of shunting engines on the network. With this reduction in the need for shunters it was decided to standardise on the Class 03 as a light diesel-mechanical shunter and the Class 08 and 09 as larger, diesel-electric shunters, leading to the withdrawal of the class 04 engines.

==Technical details==
===Overview===
Mechanically they were identical to the Class 03, with the same 24 litre Gardner engine, 5-speed epicyclic gearbox and the same overall layout. They had a straight bonnet (US: hood) from the front to the rear-mounted cab, unlike the 03s which bulged higher towards the rear (over the larger fuel tank), and the cab&#x27;s rounded roof met the sides at an angle instead of with a curve as in the 03, with a lip all the way round. The internal cab layout was almost symmetrical to allow the driver to work from either side as required.

===Drive Train===
The engine is a Gardner 8-cyl, 4-stroke 8L3 developing at 1200 rpm, connected to a Wilson-Drewry CA5 R7, 5-speed epicyclic with RF11 spiral bevel reverse and final drive unit mounted on a jackshaft. The drive to the wheels was by coupling rods from the jackshaft.

==Numbers==

The prototype (of 1947) was numbered DS1173 in departmental service. The first 60 production units (from 1952) were numbered in the sequences 11100–11103, 11105–11115, 11121–11135, 11149–11160, and 11212–11229.

From 1957, new production units received numbers in the D-prefix (&quot;Pre-TOPS&quot;) numbering series. All existing units were renumbered in the same series, sequentially from D2200 to D2259, with the new production units continuing from D2260 to D2340. Finally, the prototype locomotive left departmental service and entered the service fleet, being re-numbered as D2341; thus the oldest example of the class was allocated the last number in the numbering sequence.

==Withdrawal==
The Class 04s were withdrawn from service earlier than the Class 03, being taken out of service between June 1967 and May 1972, with some sold for re-use by industry. Four were exported to Italy about 1972, with D2289 reported as still in service until 2012.
== Preservation ==
21 examples of the class were preserved. Of these, 20 were BR Class 04 locomotives, and 1 was of the same type, but operated privately by the CEGB. One preserved engine, D2267, was scrapped in 2003, leaving 20 in preservation, including 19 originally operated by British Rail.
==Related engines==

===British industrial units===
A number of almost identical industrial locomotives were supplied to various private companies in the United Kingdom. One example (works number 2252) supplied to Adams Newport in 1948 is preserved at the Mangapps Railway Museum where it has been modified to recreate a Wisbech and Upwell Tramway Class 04, using the number 11104, which was not used in the actual class 04 numbering sequence.

===Export engines===
The Class 04 design was the basis of some related narrow gauge industrial engines built for export overseas. An example of this was the &quot;Tasmanian Government Railways V class&quot; which ran on 3 ft 6 in gauge, necessitating an outside frame design, which was the main visible difference. Western Australia also had a similar engine used by the power authority at the time also on 3 ft 6 in gauge.

==Models==
Airfix produced a plastic (static) OO gauge kit in the 1960s; this is still available in the Dapol range as kit number C60.

Bachmann produced an example in N and OO gauge. The British N gauge Bachmann model was introduced in 2007. An HO gauge model was made to be used as the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; character Mavis.

In O gauge, Vulcan produced a kit and Bachmann produced ready-to-run models.

In 2008, Bachmann Brassworks released Gauge 1 versions of the Class 04 in BR green and BR blue.

<text>A strike is a directed, forceful physical attack with either a part of the human body or with a handheld object (such as a melee weapon), intended to cause blunt or penetrating trauma upon an opponent.

There are many different varieties of strikes. A strike with the hand closed into a fist is called a &quot;punch&quot;, a strike with a fingertip is called a &quot;jab&#x27;’ a strike with the leg or foot is called a &quot;kick&quot;, and a strike with the head is called a &quot;headbutt&quot;. There are also other variations employed in martial arts and combat sports.

&quot;Buffet&quot; or &quot;beat&quot; refer to repeatedly and violently striking an opponent; this is also commonly referred to as a combination, or combo, especially in boxing or fighting video games. 
==Usage==
Strikes are the key focus of several sports and arts, including boxing, savate, karate, Muay Lao, taekwondo and wing chun. Some martial arts also use the fingertips, wrists, forearms, shoulders, back and hips to strike an opponent as well as the more conventional fists, palms, elbows, knees and feet that are common in combat sports. Other sports and arts, such as wrestling employ no strikes in focusing on grappling techniques.
There is also a form of karate called goju ryu which focuses on pressure points (joints) in the legs and arms.

==Hands and arms==
Arm strikes is the act of striking with some part of the palm, knuckle, arm, elbow, or shoulder. This is usually the elbow, the hand, the forearm, or the back of the wrist.

===Open-hand===
====Palm====
A strike using the palm of the hand. Whether the hand is open or the fingertips are folded against the bottom knuckles, palm strikes hit with the bottom part of the palm, where the hand meets the wrist. The hand is held perpendicular to the wrist to avoid hitting the softer inner wrist tissue against the target.

The bottom ridge of the palm is a surprisingly solid striking surface, and can do just as much damage as a closed fist when utilized properly (some studies have shown that a palm strike actually can produce more energy than a punch), with far less risk of injury to the striker&#x27;s own hand.

The palm strike is useful as it is thrown in a more relaxed manner than a clenched fist. This is because clenching the fist shortens the extensor muscles of the wrist which counter the action of flexor muscles of the wrist used in punching. Many martial arts teach to keep the fist clench relaxed until impact in order to maximize the speed of the punch.

Targets are numerous and some examples include the nose, jaw, ears, back of the head, the groin, the kidneys, the temples and abdominal cavity. Some combat sports, such as Pancrase, have forbidden strikes using the clenched fist but permitted strikes using the palm.

=====Slap=====

Use a stiff arm as an example, from a standing position, left hand up in guard and right hand at your side, shoot your right arm upward hitting with the forearm, since the other hand has to check low let it pass by the bicep of the right arm, as you add more power and speed you end up slapping your bicep on the way by.

====Knife hand====
A strike using the part of the hand opposite the thumb (from the little finger to the wrist), familiar to many people as a karate chop, &quot;Shuto&quot; or &quot;Tegatana&quot;. This refers to strikes performed with the side of the knuckle of the small finger.

Suitable targets for the knife hand strike include the mastoid muscles of the neck, the jugular, the throat, the collar bones, the 3rd vertebra (key stone of the spinal column), the upper arm, the wrist (knife hand block), the elbow (outside knife hand block), and the knee cap (leg throw). In many Japanese and Chinese martial arts systems, the knife hand is used to block as well as to strike.
====Ridge hand====

By tucking the thumb into the palm, a striking surface called the ridge-hand, or reverse knife-hand is formed, extending a few inches along the inside of the hand below the first knuckle of the first finger. Ridge-hand strikes commonly are delivered with a hooking motion, or with a straight arm swinging sideways.

Suitable targets include the mastoid muscles of the neck, the jugular, throat, nose, jaw, the eyes, and the groin. The ridge hand is generally considered obsolete in the martial arts and highly circumstantial. The conditioning required to effectively use it is usually better suited towards basic conditioning of other more natural parts of the body, such as punching or kicking. For example, the buckling that can occur on an unconditioned and sometimes even highly conditioned fighter when using the technique and slightly missing the main targets (eyes, neck, or nose) can do more damage to the striker, even when he hits decent targets instead, like the jaw or forehead. As such, it is considered a high-level and highly-circumstantial technique in the martial arts that still teach the technique, such as most forms of karate, tae kwon do, jujitsu, and kung fu.
The ridge hand technique is very swift and when mastered can be a formidable technique, it was used successfully by Ian Fergusson (currently 7th degree Tae Kwon Do Master) in the 1981 Tae Kwon Do championships in Argentina earning him an individual bronze medal and contributed to the team international gold medal.

====Spear hand====

Delivered just as with a punch except that the hand is held open like with a knife hand. The intended striking area are the tips of the fingers. The ideal targets are the eyes and throat. This technique is generally unsuitable against most other targets due to the high probability of it breaking one&#x27;s fingers. It does have the added advantage of increasing the range of normal hand striking by 3–4 inches or so as opposed to punching, backfisting, or hammer fisting. It is considered a high-level technique requiring enormous conditioning, but even accidental spear fingering can be quite devastating on the eyes such as punching mistakes seen in modern MMA circuits.

===Closed-fist===
====Punch====

A strike utilizing the hand with the fingers closed into a fist and striking with the knuckles (as opposed to the hammer fist described below). There are various methods of punches, including but not limited to the straight lead, the backfist, the jab, and the vertical punch.

====Hammerfist====

The hammerfist is a strike with the bottom of a clenched fist, using an action like swinging a hammer, but can also be used horizontally like a backfist strike using the bottom fist.

This strike will not damage the bones of the hands as there is no compression of the knuckles or metacarpals, and there is no leverage to bend the wrist.

The hammerfist strikes cricket ball sized areas on the body, hence is particularly effective for striking the occiput, the temples, the nose, the mandible, the wrist (for blocking punches), the testicles, the sternum, and the ear (although a cupped hand is more effective). The hammerfist is sometimes used during &quot;ground-and-pound&quot; striking in mixed martial arts to avoid damaging the bones of the hand.

The hammerfist can also be used to counter grappling charges wherein the assailant goes low, grabs the defender&#x27;s legs, and gives the defender a concussion to the back of the head. It is a non-lethal alternative to performing a karate-chop on the assailant&#x27;s exposed neck.

====Extended knuckle====
Hand strikes can be delivered with an extended knuckle, rather than the classic fist configuration used for a traditional punch. One of the fingers is moved forwards so that the impact is made with the knuckle, concentrating force onto a smaller area. This kind of strike is optimized for attacks to pressure points.
Deriving from traditional and ancient Kung Fu, such striking was considered high level technique for advanced students/inheritors of the art. The accuracy required alongside the conditioning requirements (similar to the knuckles for traditional punching) put it as a circumstantial technique and not as a standard one.

Some modern martial arts, such as Krav Maga, Aikido, Hapkido, deliver this strike to the back of the hand while being held. It puts pressure on the small bones of the opponent&#x27;s hand, causing its grip to loosen. This lets the practitioner transition smoothly into a small joint manipulation technique. However, its effectiveness when the opponent is aware that a fight is occurring has been disputed, with evidence hard to obtain due to the nature of the art and its disuse in sport, combat, sparring, or matches.

===Elbow===

An elbow strike is any type of attack utilizing the adjoining bones of the humerus and the forearm. They can either be linear or circular, and can be used in similar fashion to a standard hook, uppercut, or overhand. Elbow and knee strikes, especially when delivered from a clinch are generally associated with southeast Asian boxing (Pradal Serey and Muay Lao). 
===Shoulder===
A shoulder strike(also referred to as a shoulder butt) is a strike with the anterior part of the shoulder. It is commonly used in Bajiquan, the “&quot;Eight Extremities Fist&quot;”, as an explosive attack from the ‘&quot;zhen jiao’ (charging step)&quot; motion. This move is also commonly featured in many Japanese manga and fighting games, as the martial art is known in Japanese as Hakyyokuken. The shoulder strike can be used against the head of the opponent in close positions such as in a clinch or ground fighting, but is generally not considered to have knockout power. However, as used as a fulcrum for a joint hyperextention, such as an arm lock in classic jujitsu from stand-up or ground positions, can serve well to break said joint either when being the surface that an elbow is slammed upon or as a surface to balance out the break much as the thigh is for the juji-gatame in judo.

==Feet and legs==

Leg strikes are a physical strike using the ball of the foot, heel, shin, knee or thigh (the latter is also known as a knee strike). This attack is often used in hand-to-hand combat, especially in stand-up fighting.

===Kick===
Kicks play a significant role in many forms of martial arts, such as Taekwondo, Karate, Kung fu, Vovinam, Kickboxing, Muay Thai, Capoeira, Silat, and Kalarippayattu.

====Front kick====
Delivering a front kick involves raising the knee and foot of the striking leg to the desired height, also known as chambering, and extending the leg to contact the target, typically with the upper body straight and balanced. The actual strike is usually delivered by the ball of the foot. Thrusting one&#x27;s hips is a common method of increasing both reach and power of the kick; depending on practitioner&#x27;s particular needs, a front kick may involve more or less body motion. Front kicks are typically aimed at targets below the chest: abdomen, thighs, groin, knees or lower, however advanced practitioner have the capability of striking head-level targets with the front kick.

====Side kick====
The side kick refers to a kick that is delivered sideways in relation to the body of the practitioner. There are two areas that are commonly used as impact points in sidekicks: the heel of the foot and the outer edge of the foot. The heel is more suited to hard targets such as the ribs, stomach, jaw, temple and chest. A sidekick is performed by first chambering the kicking leg diagonally across the body, then extending the leg in a linear fashion toward the target, while flexing the abdominals.

====Roundhouse kick====
Also referred to as a &quot;round kick,&quot; or &quot;turning kick&quot;, this is the most commonly used kick in combat sports due to its power and ease of use. In most traditional martial arts, the instep is used to strike, whereas in Muay Thai, kickboxing and mixed martial arts the shin is used. To execute, the attacker swings their leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent&#x27;s side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. An important variation is the downward roundhouse kick, nicknamed the Brazilian Kick from recent MMA use: A more pronounced twist of the hips allows for a downward end of the trajectory of the kick that is very deceiving.

===Knee===
A knee strike (commonly referred to simply as a knee) is a strike with the knee, either with the kneecap or the surrounding area. The most common is the straight knee strike, often employed from a clinch or double collar tie, targeting anywhere from the groin to the head. Variants include the curved knee strike, which is similar to a roundhouse kick, and the jumping or flying knee.

===Stomp===
==Others==
While less common, other parts of the body are used in specific strikes.

===Bottom===
In a bottom strike, as taught by Impact self-defense and other self-defense systems, the defendant drives his or her hips and bottom region backward into an attacker holding them from behind in order to cause the attacker to off-balance and bend forward and possibly cause pain by striking the groin or midsection forcefully. While causing minimal striking damage on average, the attack can serve to develop a superior and/or freed position for the defendant.

===Headbutt===
A headbutt is a strike with the head, typically involving the use of robust parts of the cranium as areas of impact. Effective headbutting revolves around striking a sensitive area with a less sensitive area, such as striking the nose of an opponent with the forehead. It is known as a risky maneuver: a misplaced headbutt can cause more damage to the person delivering the headbutt than to the person receiving it.

===Hip and shoulder check===
Checking involves striking with the side of the body, at the hip or shoulder, by shifting your balance and pushing with the furthest foot to drive the body into the opponent with force. While these movements are used extensively in ice hockey (see checking (ice hockey)) they can be performed equally well on dry ground and are part of various self-defense techniques. These strikes rarely cause damage, but are used to off-balance or knock an opponent down. However, when applied with ample power and to a vulnerable region they can cause pain, for example, hitting an opponent with the shoulder to the nose, striking the upper Quadriceps femoris muscle with the hip, or driving the shoulder into the opponent&#x27;s solar plexus region.

The use of shoulders can also involve charging at the opponent at running speed, similar to a ram or tackle, though a short charge is possible where the attacker simple lunges straight at their opponent with their shoulder. These moves are generally unrefined and unprofessional, since they have a big tendency to miss, rely on brute force more than anything and usually require a run-up. If the charger does hit its intended target however, it can cause both pain and recoil to the target, knocking them over with the striker&#x27;s kinetic energy being transferred to them and falling over as a result of the force or pain.

==Principles==
Strikes in Asian martial arts and Western boxing have many of the same principles in common. These principles apply to strikes with most parts of the human body. These principles are typically learned by martial artists through multiple repetitions under the supervision of a qualified instructor. Many martial arts and texts include these principles, such as karate and Jeet Kune Do. This is only a partial list.

# Timing of muscular tension: The striker relaxes to the extent possible while delivering a strike, tensing the muscles of much of the body only at the time of impact, then relaxing again to recoil the striking part. Relaxation enables the strike to achieve the greatest possible velocity during travel, while rigidity at impact allows the maximum transfer of energy. This also works when receiving a strike: initially being relaxed as in the case of delivering a strike, tensing the muscles when receiving the impact of the received strike and then relaxing again after the recoil of the received strike (such as with the abdomen during a body blow).
# Breath control: Practitioners may include a &quot;kiai&quot; or shout, to help tense the muscles at impact and distract or frighten the opponent. Strikers generally exhale as the strike (either delivered or received) nears the target, in time with the tensing of their muscles. Breath control is also important to relax the body when not attacking; novice strikers often waste significant energy because they are tense at inappropriate times.
# Penetration: Delivered strikes should aim for a point 4–6 inches (10–15 cm) behind the target surface, to impart the most energy into the target. The striker in combat should attempt to strike through the target area, not just contact the surface. An example of increasing penetration is in turning the fist as it is thrown, a very natural punching technique that the amount of turn depends on the position be it either as an attack, defense, or counter. Instinctive punching, boxing, along with most martial arts uses this type of punching aside from Wing Chun and Capoeira who favor adding slightly more speed at the cost of moderate power loss. Received strikes, conversely, are defended against by limiting their penetration (as shown by the preceding principles).
# Focus: Strikes should channel force through a small area of the attacker&#x27;s body. For example, this is the knuckles of the middle finger and index finger, the ridge of the hand, the base of the palm, and the edge of the elbow during karate arm strikes, or the crescent/blade, heel and ball of the foot and point and the edge of the knee in Tae Kwon Do leg strikes. Focus helps in achieving proper penetration and in maximizing the damage at the point of impact.
# Kinetic linkage/Summation of force: Muscles are activated in a precise sequence to maximize the force generated. Strikes should generally be thrown with some measure of shifting body weight supporting the blow, as opposed to just the striking arm or leg. For example, the traditional boxing jab is made more forceful by driving off the rear leg and shifting body weight into the blow, while twisting the trunk and shoulder to further enhance the striking force.
# Footwork: Proper footwork is used to enable the proper balancing of the body, to support combinations of strikes and launch strikes from the proper angle or distance. This is among the most complex elements of striking, as power ultimately flows from the legs in striking and optimizing the ability to throw combinations involves precise footwork.
# Gravity: Strikes that go from high to low like hammerfists, downwards elbows, and stomp kicks see their force enhanced by gravity.

==Strategies==
Besides applying the mechanical elements described above, strikers use particular strategies to help ensure their strikes are effective. Among these strategies are:

# Combinations: Strikers may combine techniques in a series to ensure one or more strikes impact their opponents. These attacks are thrown at various targets on the body, with the greatest force typically thrown with a particular technique in the sequence.
# Weak points: Strikers often target the vulnerable and sensitive areas of opponents to incapacitate opponents via damage of vital areas or pain (either lethally or less-lethally/non-lethally), such as the base of the head, neck, groin/crotch, spine, joints, solar plexus, creases of elbows and knees, midpoints of extremities (metacarpals (front and back of palm) of hand, forearm, bicep/tricep, thigh, calf, metatarsals (sole and instep) of foot), etc.
# Level of attack: The height of attack is often varied, such as a jab to the head followed by a kick to the ribs. By varying the level of attack, strikers open the guard of their opponent.
# Timing and rhythm: Experienced strikers learn through repetition and muscle memory when (not just how) to launch particular strikes, based on the circumstances they are facing. Fights and fighters may have ebbs and flows in momentum and action that become predictable. Disrupting this flow may give the striker an advantage.
# Direct line: &quot;Telegraphing&quot; refers to moving the striking body part prior to actually launching the blow. Telegraphing signals the intent to the opponent and increases the likelihood the strike will not be effective. In general, the striking weapon should move first, with the body driving behind it. This requires proper distancing and footwork.
# Deception: Strikers use feints or distractions to disguise the timing or direction of their attacks. Stomping the foot, noise, frequent hand movement, head movement, switching the guard position, etc. are common feints. Using feints, then attacking at multiple levels and with various techniques may help deceive the opponent, defeating their guard.
# Dominant angle of attack: Achieving a positional advantage relative to your opponent. UFC champion Anderson Silva wrote: &quot;The ultimate goal in fighting is to utilize footwork to acquire a dominant angle of attack.&quot; He defines this as &quot;...a position from which you can strike your opponent, and your opponent is out of position to hit you with a strike...you want your hips facing your opponent and your opponents hips facing away from yours.&quot;

==Risks==
The human hand and foot are made up of many small bones which may be damaged by heavy impact. If a hard part of the opponent&#x27;s body or other hard object is inadvertently struck, the carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges (the wrist, hand, ankle, foot and fingers/toes) may splay and deform on impact and fracture. Martial artists wear wrist and ankle tape and handwear and footwear or other wraps so as to hold the carpals, metacarpals, tarsals, metatarsals and phalanges together and keep them from splaying and deforming, both to avoid causing debilitating injuries to themselves as well as to ensure a more direct transmission of force in their strikes by stabilising their striking limbs while delivering the strikes. One can toughen one&#x27;s bones by striking objects to induce osteoclasts (cells which remove bone) and osteoblasts (which form bone) to remodel the bone over the struck area increasing the density of bone at the striking surface. For more information on remodeling, see Wolff&#x27;s law, Davis&#x27;s law, and Mechanostat.

<text>A court of cassation is a high-instance court that exists in some judicial systems. Courts of cassation do not re-examine the facts of a case; they only interpret the relevant law. In this, they are appellate courts of the highest instance. In this way, they differ from systems that have a supreme court that can rule on both the facts of a case and the relevant law. The term derives from the Latin , &quot;to reverse or overturn&quot;.

The European Court of Justice answers questions of European Union law following a referral from a court of a member state.

However, the Court of Justice can act as a court of cassation when it hears appeals from the General Court of the European Union.

Where the system differs is that in legal systems such as the American federal courts, mid-tier appeals courts (courts of appeals) generally also remand cases to first-instance courts. In contrast, in France, for instance, courts of appeal hear cases on the facts and the law also, and only in the higher court of cassation is examination confined to matters of law.

<doc id="574110" wikidata="Q289200" url="?curid=574110" title="YEnc">
<text>yEnc is a binary-to-text encoding scheme for transferring binary files in messages on Usenet or via e-mail. It reduces the overhead over previous US-ASCII-based encoding methods by using an 8-bit encoding method. yEnc&#x27;s overhead is often (if each byte value appears approximately with the same frequency on average) as little as 1–2%, compared to 33–40% overhead for 6-bit encoding methods like uuencode and Base64. yEnc was initially developed by Jürgen Helbing, and its first release was early 2001. By 2003 yEnc became the de facto standard encoding system for binary files on Usenet. The name yEncode is a wordplay on &quot;Why encode?&quot;, since the idea is to only encode characters if it is absolutely required to adhere to the message format standard.

==How yEnc works==
Usenet and email message bodies were intended to contain only ASCII characters ( or ). Most competing encodings represent binary files by converting them into printable ASCII characters, because the range of printable ASCII characters is supported by most operating systems. However, since this reduces the available character set considerably, there is significant overhead (wasted bandwidth) over 8bit-byte networks. For example, in uuencode and Base64, three bytes of data are encoded into four printable ASCII characters, which equals four bytes, a 33% overhead (not including the overhead from headers). yEnc uses one character (one byte) to represent one byte of the file, with a few exceptions.

yEnc assumes that binary data mostly can be transmitted through Usenet and email. Therefore, 252 of the 256 possible bytes are passed through unencoded as a single byte, whether that result is a printable ASCII character or not. Only NUL, LF, CR, and = are escaped. LF and CR are escaped because the RFCs that define Internet messages still require that carriage returns and line feeds have special meaning in a mail message. = is the escape character, so it itself is escaped. NUL is also escaped because of problems handling null characters in common code, although as an optimization yEnc adds 42 to every source byte so that, not uncommon, long stretches of zero bytes do not require a lot of escaping.

There is no RFC or other standards document describing yEnc. The yEnc homepage contains a specification and a grammar 

 The yEnc homepage states that &quot;all major newsreaders have been extended to yEnc support&quot;. Microsoft&#x27;s Outlook Express, Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail do not provide yEnc support for either news or mail, but there are plug-ins available. Mozilla Thunderbird will decode single-part yEnc files, but is not able to combine multi-part binaries.

==Problems==
Many programmers and news admins have outlined the weaknesses of yEnc. It suffers from many of the same flaws as uuencode does, a number of which had already been solved years before by MIME (which addressed the same flaws in uuencode). For example, yEnc requires the strings &quot;=ybegin&quot; and &quot;=yend&quot; to be placed around the encoded file in the message body. Although this is an improvement over uuencode&#x27;s &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;, which occur more frequently in normal text, message readers can still encounter the strings outside of attachments (most frequently in discussions about yEnc itself). yEnc also attempt to reassemble files split into multiple messages by using the subject line, which is unreliable.

== yEncode adoption ==
The yEncode draft proposal document was made available on 31 July 2001. A reference encoder and decoder was included in the MyNews 1.9 freeware version in November that year. yDec, a freeware win32 decoder came on 14 November 2001. On 21 March 2002, Agent supported yEnc with version 1.91. Due to feedback of Juergen Helbing, the release was postponed by one week. A couple of days after the release Jürgen Helbing wrote that Forté implemented yEnc &quot;in the best way imaginable&quot;.

Stuffit Deluxe added yEnc support with version 8.0 in 2003. PowerArchiver 9.2 added yEnc support in May 2005.

<doc id="574113" wikidata="Q118922" url="?curid=574113" title="United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia">
<text>The United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 858 on 24 August 1993 to verify compliance with a 27 July 1993 ceasefire agreement between the Republic of Georgia and forces in Abkhazia with special attention given to the situation in the city of Sukhumi, Georgia. It was also to investigate reports of ceasefire violations, attempt to resolve such incidents with the parties involved, and to report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the implementation of its mandate. 88 military advisors were authorized to be deployed to the region. It ended on 15 June 2009, when Russia vetoed an extension of the mission. The last observers left the region on 15 July 2009.

The mission&#x27;s original mandate was invalidated after renewed fighting broke out in the area in September 1993.

UNOMIG was subsequently given an interim mandate by Security Council in November 1993 to maintain contacts with the parties involved and to monitor and report on the situation. It aimed to work towards achieving a comprehensive political settlement.

In May 1994, both sides signed the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces. in July 1994 the Security Council authorized an increase in observers (to a total of 136) and an expanded mission.

The new mission was considerably more broad than the original. UNOMIG&#x27;s original responsibilities in verifying the implementation of the ceasefire were retained. However, UNOMIG was now responsible for observing the operation of the new peacekeeping force that had been deployed by the Commonwealth of Independent States. They were also to verify, through observation and patrolling, that troops from either side did not remain in or re-enter the security zone, and that heavy military equipment did not remain or be re-introduced.

UNOMIG was to oversee the withdrawal of Georgian troops from the Kodori Valley and thus, out of Abkhaz territory. Their patrols replaced those of Georgia in the valley. They were responsible for investigating, at the request of either party or the peacekeeping force, or on their own initiative, violations of the ceasefire agreement, and for attempting to resolve resulting disputes. Finally, they were to work towards making conditions safe for the orderly return of refugees and displaced persons.

On 10 December 1996, a United Nations office for the protection of human rights in Abkhazia was established in Tbilisi, Georgia, in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1077 of 22 October. It is jointly staffed by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). The office forms part of UNOMIG and reports to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, through the Head of the UNOMIG Mission. Though they maintain a political office in Tbilisi, their military headquarters are in Sukhumi, Abkhazia.

On 8 October 2001 a UNOMIG helicopter was shot down in Abkhazia. All nine passengers were killed. The perpetrators have never been found, despite repeated demands from the Security Council.
The Security Council passed another resolution on 30 July 2003, on the recommendation of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, authorizing for a civilian police component of 20 officers be added to UNOMIG, in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out its mandate and assist in the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.

On 30 January 2004, again at the request of Secretary-General Annan, Security Council Resolution 1524 was passed, which extended UNOMIG&#x27;s mandate until 31 July 2004.

UNOMIG was concerned with security, assisting the return of the displaced and repairs of key infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. , 21 projects were at an advanced or intermediate stage and 10 others were awaiting the release of funds by donors. They also continued to push for a political settlement to the conflict, though Secretary-General Annan complained about the slow rate of progress. In late 2003, UNOMIG became concerned about an increase in kidnappings, murders and robberies, particularly in the Gori region.

The last chief military observer was Major General Anwar Hussain from Bangladesh. The strength of UNOMIG on 20 September 2008 stood at 134 military observers (including 12 medical personnel) and 17 police advisers.

In the mission the next vehicles were used during the patrols by the unarmed military observes:
Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Patrol (now instead of the Toyota 4Runner), NYALA RG-31 [mine protected vehicle, along the cease-fire line (CFL) and at the training areas]. The Nissan Patrol was used mainly in the Restricted Weapon Zone (RWZ) and in the Security Zone (SZ) of the mission.
In every patrol there were 2 vehicles with 4 unarmed military observers and one interpreter. The patrols were always in radio connection with the sector [Gali Sector HQ (in Abkhazia) or Zugdidi Sector HQ (in Georgia); and Sukhumi HQ (in Abkhazia)]. There were radio devices for every observers and in the vehicles because of the safety. Along the cease-fire line (CFL) there were a lot of Security Posts (SP) and Observing Posts (OP) both of the sides.

In the patrolling team only one person could be from one nation during the patrol. For example: 4 unarmed military observers were on the patrol from the next nations: Hungary, Indonesia, Germany, Argentina.
The mission concluded in 2009 because of a Russian veto in the United Nations Security Council. As a result of the Russian veto, UNOMIG which had been active in the region since 1993, and had 150 personnel on the ground at the time of the veto, made up of 131 military observers and 20 police officers, saw its mandate expire on 16 June 2009 at 4am GMT.

<text>Iron Fist (Daniel Thomas &quot;Danny&quot; Rand) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, Iron Fist first appeared in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #15 (May 1974). The character is a practitioner of martial arts and the wielder of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist, which allows him to summon and focus his &quot;chi&quot;. This ability is obtained from the city of K&#x27;un-Lun, which appears on Earth every 10 years.

He starred in his own solo series in the 1970s, and shared the title &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; for several years with Luke Cage, partnering with Cage to form the superhero team Heroes for Hire. Rand frequently appeared with the Daughters of the Dragon duo Misty Knight and Colleen Wing – with Rand often seen in a relationship with the former, marking the first interracial romance in Marvel Comics history. The character has starred in numerous solo titles since, including &quot;The Immortal Iron Fist&quot;, which expanded on his origin story and the history of the Iron Fist.

Iron Fist has been adapted to appear in several animated television series and video games. Finn Jones portrayed the character in the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) Netflix television series &quot;Iron Fist&quot; (2017–2018), &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017), and the second season of &quot;Luke Cage&quot; (2018).

==Publication history==
===Creation===

Iron Fist, along with the previously created martial artist Shang-Chi, came from Marvel Comics during an American pop culture trend in the early to mid-1970s of martial arts heroes. Writer/co-creator Roy Thomas wrote in a text piece in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #15 that Iron Fist&#x27;s origin and creation owe much to the Bill Everett character, John Aman, the Amazing-Man, created in 1939. Thomas later wrote that he and artist/co-creator Gil Kane had

The film mentioned by Thomas is &quot;King Boxer&quot;, aka &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; (1972), which presents the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; technique. Thomas further discussed the character&#x27;s creation stating, &quot;When Stan Lee gave me a verbal approval to star him in a series, I contacted Gil Kane and we worked out the costume and story. I had Gil give him a dragon brand on his chest, inspired by the one branded into Bullseye, a great western character created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. At Gil&#x27;s urging, we took some story elements from Bill Everett&#x27;s 1939 hero Amazing-Man, which itself had borrowed heavily from James Hilton&#x27;s novel Lost Horizon and the first movie made from it, which introduced &quot;Shangri-La&quot; to the world.&quot;

===1970s===
Debuting in a story written by Thomas and pencilled by Kane in the umbrella title &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #15–25 (May 1974 – October 1975), he was then written successively by Len Wein, Doug Moench, Tony Isabella, and Chris Claremont, with art by successive pencillers Larry Hama, Arvell Jones, Pat Broderick, and, in some of his earliest professional work, John Byrne. As the &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; issues had successfully established a considerable readership for the character, following this run, Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, which ran 15 issues (November 1975 – September 1977). The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne. A subplot involving the Steel Serpent left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues #63–64 of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, the latter of which featured Rand kiss Misty Knight, marking the first interracial kiss and first long-term interracial couple in Marvel Comics history, as well as the first couple with an age difference in which the woman was older than her man.

Iron Fist&#x27;s appearances outside his own title include three Iron Fist stories in Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white comics magazine &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; #10 (March 1975), an additional story co-starring the Sons of the Tiger in issue #18 (November 1975), and a six-part serial, &quot;The Living Weapon&quot;, in #19–24 (December 1975 – May 1976). He made guest appearances in such titles as &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;, &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, the Submariner series &quot;Namor&quot;, &quot;Black Panther&quot;, and &quot;Daredevil&quot;. 

To rescue the character from cancellation, Marvel paired Iron Fist with another character who was no longer popular enough to sustain his own series, Luke Cage. The two characters were partnered in a three-part story in Cage&#x27;s series &quot;Power Man&quot; #48–50. The title of the series changed to &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; with issue #50 (April 1978), although the indicia did not reflect this change until issue #67. Iron Fist co-starred in the series until the final issue (#125, September 1986), when the character was killed off. Writer Jim Owsley (subsequently known as Christopher Priest) later commented, &quot;Fist&#x27;s death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers&#x27; heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist&#x27;s death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book.&quot;

===1990s===
Iron Fist was revived half a decade later in &quot;Namor, the Sub-Mariner&quot; #21–25 (December 1991 – April 1992), a story which revealed that the character killed in &quot;Power Man and Iron Fist&quot; #125 was a doppelgänger. The story was both written and drawn by Byrne, who found the manner of Iron Fist&#x27;s death objectionable and later commented, &quot;In one of those amazing examples of Marvel serendipity, it turned out to be fairly easy not only to resurrect Danny, but to make it seem like that was the plan all along.&quot; Iron Fist then became a frequently starring character in the anthology series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, featuring in three multi-part story arcs and four one-shot stories in 1992 and 1993. Two solo miniseries followed: &quot;Iron Fist&quot; (vol. 2) #1–2 (September–October 1996), by writer James Felder and penciller Robert Brown; and &quot;Iron Fist&quot; (vol. 3) #1–3 (July–September 1998), by writer Dan Jurgens and penciller Jackson Guice. Also around this time, he was among the ensemble of the group series &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot; which ran 19 issues (July 1997 – January 1999).

===2000s===
Following a four-issue miniseries by writer Jay Faerber and penciller Jamal Igle, &quot;Iron Fist: Wolverine&quot; (November 2000 – February 2001), co-starring the X-Men character Wolverine and cover-billed as &quot;Iron Fist/Wolverine: The Return of K&#x27;un-Lun&quot;, came another solo miniseries, &quot;Iron Fist&quot; vol. 4 #1–6 (May–October 2004), by writer Jim Mullaney and penciller Kevin Lau. Subsequently, a new Iron Fist series premiered called &quot;The Immortal Iron Fist&quot;. The series was written jointly by Ed Brubaker and Matt Fraction from issues #1–14 (January 2007 – June 2008) with artists Travel Foreman and David Aja. Fraction wrote issues #15 and 16 alone. From issue #17 (September 2008) to the series&#x27; cancellation at issue #27 (August 2009), the series was written by Duane Swierczynski and largely drawn by a returning Travel Foreman.

===2010s and 2020s===
Iron Fist appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 &quot;New Avengers&quot; series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue, #34 (January 2013). In 2014, Iron Fist was given new life and set to star in a new 12-issue comic book series written and drawn by Kaare Andrews titled &quot;Iron Fist: The Living Weapon&quot; as part of the &quot;All-New Marvel NOW!&quot; event.

In January 2021, Iron Fist starred in the series &quot;Iron Fist: Heart of the Dragon&quot;, written by Larry Hama with art by David Wachter. In October 2021, Marvel announced that Danny Rand will retire as Iron Fist and pass the mantle to a successor. The five-issue limited series, written by Alyssa Wong and art by Michael YG, was released in February 2022, which revealed Lin Lie as the new Iron Fist and Rand appearing in a supporting role.

Iron Fist&#x27;s 50th anniversary was commemorated in the one-shot &quot;Iron Fist 50th Anniversary Special&quot; #1. Released in August 2024, the one-shot featured Danny Rand in several short stories set throughout his life that included Wolverine, Lin Lie, the Daughters of the Dragon and Heroes for Hire in supporting roles. The one-shot concluded with Rand being killed off in the final story; similar to the X-Men line of comics featured in the 2024 &quot;X-Men: From the Ashes&quot; relaunch, the special included a QR code leading to an extra digital stinger page, in which case teased a possible resurrection for Rand.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Danny Rand was born in New York City. His father, Wendell Rand, as a young boy happened upon the mystical city of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un. During his time in K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un, Wendell saved the life of the city&#x27;s ruler, Lord Tuan, and was adopted as Tuan&#x27;s son. However, Wendell eventually left K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States. He married socialite Heather Duncan and had a child, Daniel. Wendell later organizes an expedition to again seek out K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un, taking his wife Heather, his business partner Harold Meachum and nine-year-old Danny. During the journey up the mountain, Danny slips off the path, his tie-rope taking his mother and father with him. Meachum, who also loves Heather, forces Wendell to plunge to his death but offers to rescue Heather and Danny. She rejects his help. Heather and Danny come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves. Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Danny and is killed even as archers from K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un attempt to save her. The archers take the grieving Danny to see Yu-Ti, the hooded ruler of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un. When Danny expresses his desire for vengeance, Yü-Ti apprentices him to Lei Kung the Thunderer, who teaches him martial arts. Danny proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung&#x27;s students. He toughens his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock. At 19, Danny is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the dragon Shou-Lao, who guards its disembodied molten heart. Guessing that the heart provides life energy to Shou-Lao through the dragon-shaped scar on its chest, Danny covers the scar with his own body and hangs on until Shou-Lao collapses and dies, in the process burning a dragon brand into his own chest. Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing its heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Danny is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists. When K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un reappears on Earth after 10 years, Danny leaves to find his father&#x27;s killer. Returning to New York, Danny Rand, dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist, seeks out Harold Meachum, now head of Meachum Industries. After overcoming a number of attempts on his life, he confronts Meachum in his office, only to discover that he had previously had his legs amputated due to frostbite. Meachum tells Iron Fist to kill him, but he refuses to do so and walks away. At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja, and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death.

Eventually, Iron Fist clears his name and begins a career as a superhero, aided by his friends Colleen Wing and Misty Knight. Notable adversaries in his early career include Sabretooth, the mysterious Master Khan (whom the ninja that killed Meachum once served), and the Steel Serpent, the exiled son of Lei Kung who coveted the Iron Fist power.

===Heroes for Hire===
While working undercover, Misty Knight infiltrates the organization of crime lord John Bushmaster. When Bushmaster discovers Knight&#x27;s treachery, he kidnaps Claire Temple and Noah Burstein, close associates of Luke Cage, better known as Power Man, and holds them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight. Iron Fist is on hand to stop him, however, and after a battle, the truth comes out. Rand helps Cage and the Daughters of the Dragon (Knight and Wing) battle Bushmaster, rescue Temple and Burstein, and obtain evidence that proves Cage&#x27;s innocence of prior drug charges. Afterwards, Iron Fist and Power Man become partners, forming Heroes for Hire, Inc. Iron Fist, in his secret identity of Danny Rand, resumes control of his parents&#x27; fortune as half of Rand-Meachum, Inc., making him quite wealthy. This causes tension between Rand and Cage, who was raised poor. Power Man and Iron Fist&#x27;s partnership ends when Rand is diagnosed with cancer and gets kidnapped as part of a plot masterminded by Master Khan. Just prior to a battle with the Black Dragon Chiantang (the brother of the mythical Dragon King), Danny is replaced by a doppelgänger created by the extra-dimensional H&#x27;ylthri. The double (who wears a red variant of the Iron Fist costume) is killed by Captain Hero a short time later. Cage, now the prime suspect in Rand&#x27;s apparent death, becomes a fugitive.

===Resurrection===
While in stasis in K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un with the H&#x27;ylthri, Iron Fist manages to focus his &quot;chi&quot;, curing the cancer. He is later freed from stasis by Namor. Rand and Cage reform Heroes for Hire, Inc. with an expanded team, this time working for Namor&#x27;s Oracle Corporation. Namor ultimately dissolves Oracle as well as Heroes for Hire, Inc. Iron Fist later loses his powers to Junzo Muto, the young leader of the Hand, and subsequently becomes the guardian of a pack of displaced dragons in Tokyo. His powers are eventually restored by Chiantang, who brainwashes Iron Fist and forces him to battle Black Panther. Black Panther is able to free Iron Fist from the creature&#x27;s control, and the two work together to defeat the Black Dragon in Wakanda. In the &quot;Iron Fist&quot; miniseries, Miranda Rand-K&#x27;ai also returns from the dead. The H&#x27;ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra-dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key. To this end, she takes the identity of Death Sting, bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with S.H.I.E.L.D. When the H&#x27;ylthri try to kill Iron Fist, Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them, seemingly killing herself in the process. However, exposure to chemicals from the H&#x27;ylthri pods prevented her death.

===Posing as Daredevil===
Rand disguises himself as Daredevil to convince the media and the public that Matt Murdock is not the masked vigilante. During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, he opposes the Superhuman Registration Act, joining Captain America while still pretending to be Daredevil. Rand is apprehended by Pro-Registration forces. He is later freed from the Negative Zone Prison, joining Captain America&#x27;s team to battle Iron Man&#x27;s forces.

===New Avengers===
After the arrest of Captain America, Rand joins the New Avengers, an underground group provided with secure accommodation by Doctor Strange and which includes his former teammate Luke Cage. In the public eye, Rand is able to avoid arrest with legal loopholes. Rand leaves the New Avengers, due to a variety of problems, but lets them know, if they ever need him, to give him a call. He later aids the New Avengers in locating and rescuing Cage from Norman Osborn after Cage suffered a heart attack and was summarily taken into custody as a fugitive.

===&quot;The Immortal Iron Fist&quot;===

Orson Randall, Danny Rand&#x27;s immediate predecessor, seeks out Danny Rand in New York and gives him The Book of the Iron Fist, a sacred ledger supposedly containing all the kung fu secrets of previous Iron Fists, which Randall claims will be necessary if Rand is to compete successfully in the coming tournament of the Seven Champions. The Steel Serpent, whose powers have been greatly augmented by the Crane Mother, dispatches Randall. On the brink of death, Randall surrenders his &quot;chi&quot; to Rand, giving him sufficient power to battle the Serpent to a standstill. After the battle, Rand is summoned by his master, Lei Kung (who is also the father of Steel Serpent) to compete in a tournament that will decide the cycle according to which each of the Seven Cities of Heaven appears on Earth. However, the leaders of the Seven Cities had secretly erected gateways between Earth and each city without the knowledge of the populace. The corruption of the leaders of the Seven Cities of Heaven spurs Iron Fist, Lei Kung, Orson Randall&#x27;s daughter, and John Aman to plan a revolution. Iron Fist discovers that Crane Mother and Xao, a high-ranking HYDRA operative, are planning to destroy K&#x27;un-Lun by using a portal. Upon learning of the plot, Steel Serpent helps Rand and the other Immortal Weapons defeat Xao.

Rand destroys the train intended to destroy K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un by extending his &quot;chi&quot; to find the train&#x27;s electromagnetic field. Meanwhile, the revolution orchestrated by Lei Kung and Orson&#x27;s daughter proves successful, with Nu-an, the Yu-Ti of K&#x27;un-Lun fleeing in terror. When Rand confronts Xao, Xao reveals that there is an eighth city of Heaven before killing himself. Rand suggests Lei Kung as the new Yu-Ti, with Orson&#x27;s unnamed daughter as the new Thunderer.

After learning that the Randall fortune that started Rand International was formed from the oppression of the Cities of Heaven, Rand decides to transform the company into a non-profit organization, dedicated to helping the poor. He also sets up the Thunder Dojo in Harlem to help inner-city children, buys back the old Heroes for Hire building as the new Rand International Headquarters and his new home, while offering Luke Cage a position at the company. He also tries to reconnect with Misty Knight. Rand, on his 33rd birthday, learns every single one of the previous Iron Fists died at the age of 33, except Orson Randall, who vanished at that time. Soon afterward, Rand is attacked and defeated by Zhou Cheng, a servant of Ch&#x27;i-Lin, who claims to have killed the Iron Fists in order to enter K&#x27;un-Lun and devour the egg that births the next incarnation of Shou-Lao the Undying every generation, thus wiping out K&#x27;un-Lun&#x27;s Iron Fist legacy. Luke, Misty, and Colleen arrive and save Rand. Rand has his shoulder dislocated during a second battle with Cheng, but manages to defeat Cheng even in his weakened state. Following the duel, the Immortal Weapons, Luke, Colleen, and Misty arrive, and reveal to Rand that they have discovered a map in Cheng&#x27;s apartment that leads to the Eighth City of Heaven. Rand and the others realize that this is where Ch&#x27;i-Lin originated, and depart for the Eighth City.

In the Eighth City, he meets Quan Yaozu, the first Iron Fist, who became disillusioned with K&#x27;un-Lun and rose up to rule the Eighth City as Changming. Rand and Fat Cobra manage to defeat Quan. Rand&#x27;s actions during their battles impress Quan, who decides that Rand may be living proof that K&#x27;un-Lun is not the corrupt city it once was. Rand and Davos agree to guide Quan to K&#x27;un-Lun and arrange a meeting between him and Lei-Kung to give Quan a forum for his grievances. However, when Rand returns to New York, he finds a HYDRA cell waiting for him at Rand International, seeking retribution for the death of Xao, and holding Misty hostage. In the ensuing battle, Rand International is destroyed, but Rand and Misty escape unharmed. Now left with only a fraction of his former net worth, Rand and Misty purchase a new condo in Harlem, and Rand decides to focus all of his attention and remaining resources at the Thunder Dojo. While moving into their new home, Rand asks Misty to marry him. Initially skeptical of the offer, Misty accepts and reveals that she is pregnant with Rand&#x27;s child.

===Avengers reform===
In the aftermath of &quot;Siege&quot;, Rand joins the newly reformed New Avengers. After finding out that Misty&#x27;s pregnancy was false, Misty and Danny decide to move out of their apartment and live separately, but continue their relationship. During the &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, Danny later has an encounter with someone who is going by the name of Power Man. He and Luke Cage discover that the Power Man is Victor Alvarez, a survivor of a building that Bullseye blew up. Iron Fist becomes the new Power Man&#x27;s mentor and the two become a team. During the &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Iron Fist and the Immortal Weapons are summoned to Beijing to close the gates of the Eighth City that are on the verge of opening. However, Danny is placed under mind control which creates a mystical interference with the ability of the Immortal Weapons to close the gate. He is then forced to battle his allies. Thanks to War Machine knocking him out, the mission is completed successfully. However, Doctor Strange realizes that Iron Fist is now an Immortal Weapon of Agamotto. During the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, Iron Fist and Lei Kung bring Hope Summers to K&#x27;un-Lun to train as an Iron Fist, in order to defeat the Phoenix-possessed X-Men.

===&quot;Marvel NOW!&quot;===
In &quot;Iron Fist: The Living Weapon&quot;, Iron Fist is approached by a young monk named Pei, who tells him to return to K&#x27;un-Lun. Upon returning, Iron Fist discovers the city in ruins and Lei Kung dead at the hands of the One, a chi-powered robot who believed itself to be Danny&#x27;s father Wendell Rand. Iron Fist is defeated by the One, but is rescued by his childhood friend Sparrow and the One&#x27;s creator Fooh, who nurse him back to health and warn him that the One and Davos were working together to turn New York into New K&#x27;un-Lun. During Iron Fist&#x27;s and the One&#x27;s second confrontation, the One opens an artificial portal between Earth and the Heavens in an attempt to retrieve Wendell&#x27;s deceased wife Heather Rand from the afterlife, the but Xian fire god Zhu Rong emerges in Manhattan to punish the mortals for upsetting the universal order. By focusing his chi energy into his fist and launching himself into Zhu Rong, Iron Fist defeats the fire god. Meanwhile, Davos attempts to take the power of the Iron Fist from a reborn Shou-Lou, but is stopped by Pei, who gains the power of the Iron Fist to defeat Davos and revive Shou-Lou, naming his adolescent reborn form &quot;Gork&quot;. As the youngest person to ever bear the mark of the Iron Fist, Pei is subsequently taken in by Danny as his ward. In the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; era, Iron Fist rejoins Luke Cage as the Heroes For Hire, having been employed by Boomerang to arrest his former colleagues in the Sinister Six.

===&quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;===
In the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; era, Danny and Luke are forced to return to crime fighting after former Heroes for Hire secretary Jennifer &quot;White Jennie&quot; Royce becomes embroiled in a gang war with Black Mariah against Tombstone. After that is dealt with, Power Man and Iron Fist once again take to the streets as the Heroes for Hire. During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Iron Fist became a member of the Defenders alongside Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones. They, alongside Cloak and Dagger, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Woman, fought the Army of Evil during Hydra&#x27;s takeover of the United States where they were defeated by Nitro. Iron Fist and those with him were trapped in the Darkforce dome by Blackout when his powers were enhanced by Baron Helmut Zemo using the Darkhold. During the &quot;Hunt for Wolverine&quot; storyline, Iron Fist babysat Danielle Cage while Luke and Jessica were away helping Iron Man and Spider-Man look for Wolverine&#x27;s body after it went missing from its private resting place. After the mission was over, Luke and Jessica thanked Iron Fist for babysitting Danielle.

===&quot;Heart of the Dragon&quot;===
The dragons of the Heavenly Cities are being targeted by armies of undead ninjas and several villains, including Taskmaster, Lady Bullseye and Midnight Sun for their hearts, resulting in the deaths of many dragons and Tiger&#x27;s Beautiful Daughter, prompting Iron Fist to team up with Luke, Pei, Gork, Fooh and the remaining Immortal Weapons to save the other dragons. At the urging of the Xian goddess of Mercy Quan Yin, Iron Fist and the others use Fooh&#x27;s portal technology to manifest the Heavenly Cities on Earth so that other heroes, including Okoye and Sunspot, can join in the defense against the hordes of zombies and villains. When the zombies prove too much for them, Iron Fist and the group retreat to the Heart of Heaven, where they come across Okoye slaying the dragon of the Heart of Heaven, who takes advantage of their shock to slay the newly rescued dragon of the Kingdom of Spiders as well; Okoye explains that she was told to kill them by Quan Yin and the Heart of Heaven&#x27;s dragon in order to secure the cosmic balance, thus gaining the power of both dragons. Yama Dragonsbane, Danny&#x27;s former lover Brenda Swanson, subsequently appears in the Heart of Heaven and reveals herself to be behind the dragon slayings in order to use their hearts to empower her master, the Hierophant, who is also summoned to the Heart of Heaven. While Fooh distracts the Hierophant, Iron Fist and the others travel to the Eighth City to destroy the Hierophant&#x27;s undead army but are attacked by the city&#x27;s Ghost Dragon. When the Ghost Dragon proves impossible to harm, Pei and Gork reluctantly allow Okoye to kill Gork for his heart, knowing that he and the other dragons can be revived if she can defeat the Hierophant. With Pei&#x27;s and Gork&#x27;s powers, Okoye is able to slay the Ghost Dragon and claim his power. When the Hierophant arrives, Danny transfers the Iron Fist to Okoye, granting her the full power of the Heavenly Cities. Okoye uses her combined dragon chi to defeat the Hierophant and Dragonsbane while Iron Fist and the others finish off the remaining undead. The Hierophant&#x27;s death releases the hearts of the dragons slain by him and Okoye back to their respective Cities, although the Iron Fist powers of Danny, Pei and Gork remain with Okoye. Okoye attempts to return the Iron Fist back to Danny, who refuses, declaring that Okoye is the new Iron Fist. Due to her obligations to Wakanda, Okoye refuses and instead transfers the Iron Fist to Gork&#x27;s newly reborn egg, leaving the title and power vacant. Despite being powerless, an undeterred Danny declares to Luke that he will &quot;live [life] to the fullest&quot;.

===Devil&#x27;s Reign===
During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Mayor Wilson Fisk outlaws superhero vigilantism in New York City. Despite his retirement as Iron Fist, Danny is apprehended at his office by NYPD officers led by Thunderbolts member Crossbones. Danny attempts to fight them off but is overpowered and incarcerated in the Myrmidon along with others targeted by the new law. Danny, Moon Knight and Tony Stark are able to escape with the help of Sue Storm and Reed Richards. After Fisk is defeated and Luke is elected mayor of New York City, Danny accompanies Luke on several of his first outings as mayor.

===Meeting the New Iron Fist===
While a powerless Danny fights several demons attacking a Chinese antique shop in Flushing for a mysterious green shard, he is helped by Lin Lie - formerly the superhero Sword Master - who is now garbed in the mantle of the Iron Fist and possesses the chi of Shou-Lao. After they defeat the demons and recover the shard, Danny attempts to question Lie about his background and offers to help him, but Lie rebuffs him and flees through a portal in a nearby subway back to K&#x27;un-Lun. Danny contacts Fat Cobra and the Bride of Nine Spiders with tracking down the new Iron Fist, eventually finding him in Gansu. Danny travels with the two and Luke to China but he and Luke get separated from the two Immortal Weapons, who encounter Lie before him. When an army the same demons from Flushing appear, Danny, Luke and the Immortal Weapons join forces with Lie and his friends to fight them. When the Yu-Ti of K&#x27;un-Lun, Sparrow, and her best warriors are summoned by Danny for backup, the demons&#x27; leader and Lie&#x27;s brother, Lin Feng, reveals that moment to be his true goal and steals Sparrow&#x27;s portal to K&#x27;un-Lun to find the final tomb of his master Chiyou, leaving the K&#x27;un-Lun citizens trapped on Earth. Danny offers housing to the displaced citizens and formally introduces himself to Lie. Danny compliments Lie&#x27;s acquired skills and offers to complete his training; Lie readily accepts.

===Gang War===
In the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Danny is recruited along with Jessica, Cloak and Dagger by Luke as part of his new vigilante team when New York&#x27;s criminal underworld escalates into a city-wide war. Danny and Luke&#x27;s team are able to thwart Alistair Smythe and his Spider-Slayers from attacking New York during the Gang War. When Luke suspects Shang-Chi&#x27;s motives due to the Five Weapons Society&#x27;s involvement in the war, Danny joins him and several other heroes to confront Shang-Chi at the House of the Deadly Hand in Chinatown. Shang-Chi is ultimately able to prove his loyalty to the heroes and Danny helps him fight off an invasion from the Society&#x27;s enemies in the war. During the final gang battle in Central Park, Danny and Shang-Chi are sidetracked by fending off tanks while the other heroes intervene between the warring forces of Madame Masque and Beetle.

===Death===
After a night out celebrating his 34th birthday with Luke and Jeryn Hogarth, Danny is ambushed at his penthouse by the same Ch&#x27;i-Lin that previously attempted to kill him on his 33rd birthday and has now possessed the body of Razor Fist. Due to the Ch&#x27;i-Lin confusing Danny with an illusion-making mist and having hired the Shocker to keep Lie and Pei preoccupied, a powerless Danny is overwhelmed and killed by the Ch&#x27;i-Lin.

Danny is given a Buddhist funeral at Calvary Cemetery, which is attended by Luke, Lie and many of his close friends and former teammates. While Danny is being buried, an alternate future version of Luke using his Power Man moniker is sent back from his timeline to the present and immediately sets out to prevent Danny from becoming the Immortal Moon Knight, which would lead to the events of his apocalyptic future. After discovering that Danny is already dead, which did not occur in his timeline, Power Man realizes that his future has been averted and leaves the funeral unseen while mourning his former friend&#x27;s death.

Weeks after his death, a glowing blue skeletal hand emerges from Danny&#x27;s grave.

==Powers and abilities==
Plunging his fists into the molten heart of the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying infused the dragon&#x27;s superhuman energy into Rand. This, along with being trained by Lei Kung the Thunderer, gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist, allowing him to summon and focus his &quot;chi&quot; energy (also called natural energy or life force energy) to enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes and senses can all be greatly intensified, almost comparable to superhuman levels.

He is able to concentrate his own &quot;chi&quot; and the superhuman energy from Shou-Lao&#x27;s heart into his hand, with it manifesting as a supernatural glow around his hand and fist. So concentrated, this &quot;iron fist&quot; can strike with superhuman hardness and impact, while his hand becomes impervious to pain and injury. Some of Rand&#x27;s feats with the &quot;iron fist&quot; is knocking out Luke Cage, knocking out a drunken Hercules, almost defeating Black Panther before ultimately losing, and taking down the S.H.I.E L.D Helicarrier with a single punch. However, summoning the power required by this feat leaves Rand physically and mentally drained, unable to repeat the act for a time, as long as an entire day in certain instances, though after years of using the ability, it has become less draining. He can focus his &quot;chi&quot; inward to heal himself or outward to heal others of injury, as well as to give himself psychic senses and to telepathically fuse his consciousness with another person when looking directly into the pupil of his eye.

Rand is also a skilled acrobat, gymnast, and a master of all of K&#x27;un-Lun&#x27;s martial arts, as well as various fighting styles from Earth, including Shaolin Kung Fu, Aikido, Fujian White Crane, Judo, Karate, Muay Thai, Ninjutsu, Wushu, and Wing Chun.

==Other characters named Iron Fist==
This section lists the other people who have been called Iron Fist:

===Fan Fei===
In 1,000,000 BC, a K&#x27;un-Lun native named Fan Fei was born to the Green Lotus House and had taken a fascination with the cavemen that lived outside K&#x27;un-Lun; going so far as to train a few of them in secret. After she was exposed, Fan Fei was chained up and forced to watch as her students were fed to Shou-Lou by Lei Kung. When she broke out, in the hopes that she will die fighting Shou-Lou, Fan Fei punched the dragon in his chest tattoo and gained his powers. Lei Kung had Fan Fei exiled from K&#x27;un-Lun, believing Shou-Lou was dead, and she traveled the world; fighting Deviants and the Gorgilla Clan of Man-Apes along the way. Fan Fei was approached by Mephisto, who wanted her to use her powers to conquer Earth, but she declined. In response, Mephisto granted his gifts to the Gorgilla Clan. After a fight with Fan Fei, Mephisto led the Gorgilla Clan&#x27;s Ape King to the Power Infinity Gem, which he used to fight Fan Fei again. After recuperating, Fan Fei found herself at the entrance of K&#x27;un-Lun. Lei Kung states that her sentencing was wrong, as they learned Shou-Lou was immortal, and wanted to bring her home. However, she declined, stating that Earth was her home and her fights here are just the beginning. Fan Fei later banded together with Agamotto, Lady Phoenix, Odin, and Stone Age versions of Black Panther, Ghost Rider, and Star Brand to fight off a Celestial named the Fallen. They would go on to defeat it and seal it underground in what would later become South Africa.

===Quan Yaozu===
One of the first Iron Fists, Quan Yaozu was sent to the Eighth City to imprison the demonic creatures sent from there that had been plaguing K&#x27;un-Lun and the other Heavenly Cities, voluntarily staying behind to prevent them from escaping. When the Yu-Ti of K&#x27;un-Lun began using the Eight City to imprison citizens who threatened his rule, including innocents, Quan became disillusioned with K&#x27;un-Lun and eventually took control of the Eighth City, ruling it as &quot;Changming&quot;. Centuries later, when Danny and the Immortal weapons arrive in the Eighth City at the behest of Lei Kung to free the wrongfully convicted prisoners, Quan has them captured and forces them to fight to the death in numerous matches. When Danny finds out about Quan&#x27;s history, he is able to prove his altruistic intentions, which convinces Quan that K&#x27;un-Lun is no longer the corrupt city as it once was and agrees to meet Lei Kung.

===Li Park===
In 730 A.D., a pacifist named Li Park became the new Iron Fist, who sought to resolve conflict by avoiding direct conflict. As a local village battled with a Chinese general intent on conquering K&#x27;un-Lun, which had been struck by a plague, Li utilized his newly discovered hypnotic fist technique to dissuade the soldiers. When his technique failed to save the villagers, Li put aside his pacifism and used more aggressive actions. Ultimately, Li was able to rescue the remaining villagers and led them to K’un-Lun, where they helped repopulate the city.

===Gale===
During the 11th Century, the outlaw Atlantean princess Gale wielded the powers of the Iron Fist. She was part of Thor&#x27;s incarnation of the Avengers.

===Bei-Ming Tian===
Bei Ming-Tian was the Iron Fist circa 1227 AD. He protected his village from the invading Mongol Army and even slew Genghis Khan himself in battle.

===Fongji Wu===
Centuries ago, the Yu-Ti Nu-An had a recurring dream associating a red-haired girl with the Phoenix and a dragon. He later finds a matching red-haired girl named Fongji Wu in the streets of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un and has her trained as the Iron Fist. Nu-An asks for Leonardo da Vinci to come to K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un in order to help protect the world against the Phoenix&#x27;s arrival; meanwhile, Fongji is submitted to a hard training, eventually manifesting the Phoenix powers. Nu-An orders her to battle the dragon Shao-Lao as established by the ritual of the Iron Fist. Fongji is successful in her test and becomes the Iron Fist, shortly before Da Vinci sees the Phoenix coming towards Earth. Fongji is able to bond with the Phoenix and remain in control of herself, but she feels that Earth is still not ready for its evolution and departs.

===Wu Ao-Shi===
In 1545 A.D., a young protégé of Lei Kung named Wu Ao-Shi defeated Shou-Lou the Undying and claimed the power of the Iron Fist for herself. During her training, she fell in love and became betrothed to a fisherman, who became distraught at the violence destined for the Iron Fist and left her and K&#x27;un-Lun once the city merged with Earth; Wu followed shortly after to search for her love. During her travels Wu made a living as a mercenary and took on a job to liberate Pinghai Bay from the Wokou pirates, but was defeated and imprisoned. Wu was rescued by her beloved, and killed the pirates by infusing her chi into an arrow, turning it into an explosive projective. Wu and the fisherman spent their remaining years together in the liberated territory, with Wu later becoming known as the Pirate Queen of Pinghai Bay. Centuries later, Wu Ai-Shi&#x27;s exploits were made into a movie called &quot;Pinghai Bay&quot;.

===Bei Bang-Wen===
Sometime in the mid-19th century, an Iron Fist known as Bei Bang-Wen developed an Iron Fist technique known as the Perfect Strategy Mind, which let him use the chi of Shou-Lou in more intellectual ways but also left him overconfident. In 1860, Bei assisted the Chinese against the British and French forces during the Second Opium War. Despite forming a scenario taking down tens of thousands of enemy soldiers at the Taku Forts, Bei and his Chinese allies were defeated at the Taku Forts and Bei was taken prisoner. After befriending fellow captive and mythical warrior Vivatma Visvajit, the two escaped from prison and journeyed to Vivatma&#x27;s homeland of Burma, where they were ambushed by the energy-draining assassin Tiger Jani. Bei and Vivatma defeated Jani with their reawakened their Iron Fist and Brahman powers, respectively. A physically and mentally worn Bei returned home to K&#x27;un-Lun, relinquishing his powers so that the cycle of the Iron Fist could begin again and took a wife who bore him thirteen sons.

===Kwai Jun-Fan===
Bei Bang-Wen&#x27;s successor to the Iron Fist, Kwai Jun-Fan ventured the Wild West of Texas circa 1878 AD where he was killed by Zhou Cheng under the influence of Ch&#x27;i-Lin.

===Orson Randall===
Born and raised in K&#x27;un-Lun after his parents&#x27; airship crashed in the city in the late 19th century, Orson Randall became the Iron Fist after besting Shou-Lao when he was seventeen years old, becoming the first Westerner to do so. During World War I, Randall joined the Freedom&#x27;s Five along with Union Jack, Phantom Eagle, Crimson Cavalier and Sir Steel. The bloodshed Randall witnessed in the war deeply traumatized him, causing him to turn to drugs to escape. In 1933, Randall was summoned back to K&#x27;un-Lun to participate in the Tournament of Heaven, but refused to participate, having been changed by his experiences in the war. When confronted by the Immortal Weapons, Randall killed the Crane Champion of K&#x27;un-Zi in self defense and fled, taking the Book of the Iron Fist with him.

While in hiding, Randall met young orphan Wendell Rand and adopted him as his ward, training him in martial arts while filling his head with stories of K&#x27;un-Lun and the Iron Fist, causing Wendell to seek the city out himself once he came of age. Sometime after the 1960s Randall was believed to have died, leaving behind a vast fortune to Wendell, making him incredibly wealthy. In truth, Randall was living in drug-soaked seclusion in Thailand for decades. While the next Tournament of Heaven neared, the Steel Serpent and his allies arrived to kill him, causing Randall to flee to New York to seek out his successor and Wendell&#x27;s son Danny, giving him the Book of the Iron Fist and informing him of the upcoming Tournament and their histories. During another encounter with the Steel Serpent, Randall is mortally wounded and transfers his chi to Danny before dying.

===Pei===
A young monk of K&#x27;un-Lun, Pei fled from the city when Davos and the One staged a coup, taking the unhatched egg of the latest incarnation of Shou-Lao with her. Pei was able to find Danny in New York and told him to go back to save K&#x27;un-Lun. While under her care, the egg prematurely hatches into an adolescent dragon, whom Pei names &quot;Gork&quot;. When Davos catches up to them and kills Gork, Pei inadvertently ends up with the power of the Iron Fist, becoming one of the youngest to do so, and uses its power to defeat Davos and revive Gork and all previous incarnations of Shou-Lou. Danny subsequently takes her under his wing as his ward and the two being training together to master their Iron Fist powers. During the Hierophant&#x27;s attacks on the dragons of the Heavenly Cities, Pei reluctantly allows Okoye to sacrifice Gork and transfers her Iron Fist power to augment Okoye&#x27;s acquired dragon chi to defeat the Hierophant and save the dragons.

While Danny is away on a business trip, he sends Pei a mystical K&#x27;un-Lun medallion that gives her powers similar to her lost Iron Fist powers. Pei meets and teams up with Danny&#x27;s successor Lin Lie against the Shocker, who unbeknownst to both had been hired by the Ch&#x27;i-Lin to keep them preoccupied while it kills Danny.

===Wah Sing-Rand===
In an alternate timeline set in the 31st century, Wah Sing-Rand, a K&#x27;un-Lun native and Danny&#x27;s possible descendant, defeats Shou-Lou, becoming one of the youngest Iron Fists in history. While traveling to the planet Yaochi to free it from the tyrannical President Xing, his shuttle is frozen in a temporal pocket, leaving him trapped for 24 years. In circa 3099 AD., he was able to defeat Xing and liberate Yaochi but at the cost of his own life.

==Supporting characters==
==Alternative versions==
A number of alternate universes in Marvel Comics publications have allowed writers to introduce variations of Iron Fist, in which the character&#x27;s origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting.

===&quot;Cosmic Ghost Rider&quot;===
An unidentified female version of Iron Fist made a cameo appearance in &quot;Cosmic Ghost Rider&quot; vol. 1 #3 (September 2018), as one of the many heroes Cable brought back in time to kill Thanos as a baby. However, Iron Fist was killed by Thanos after his guardian, the Cosmic Ghost Rider, was subdued.

===&quot;Deadpool 2099&quot;===
An alternate universe variant of Iron Fist appears in &quot;Deadpool 2099&quot;.

===Earth-13584===
An alternate universe variant of Iron Fist from Earth-13584, a pocket dimension created by A.I.M., appears in &quot;Dark Avengers&quot;.

===&quot;MC2&quot;===
An alternate universe variant of Iron Fist appears in &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; #24.

===&quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;===
An alternate universe variant of Iron Fist from Earth-2149 appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot;. Despite being bitten by several zombies, he manages to avoid transforming into one due to his healing factor repelling the infection.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015)===
An alternate universe variant of Iron Fist from Earth-13116 appears in &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. This version is Rand-K&#x27;ai, a guardian of the K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un region of Battleworld and an unwilling servant of Emperor Zheng Zu who later helps Zheng Zu&#x27;s son Shang-Chi overthrow him.

===&quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot;===
An alternate universe variant of Iron Fist from Earth-1610 appears in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;.

===&quot;Ultimate Universe&quot;===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. Danny Rand appears as an inmate of the Gordium Correctional Facility that is owned by the Midas Group. When in the cafeteria, he was threatened by a knife-wielding inmate and punched him in self-defense. Then he met fellow inmate Luke Cage who talked to him about the prison systems. Danny later assisted Luke in the prison riot at Gordium Correctional Facility. The news mentions that the prison riot has entered its third day.

==Reception==
Iron Fist is ranked as the 195th-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine. IGN also ranked Iron Fist as the 68th-greatest comic book hero of all time stating that in the Marvel Universe, mastery of martial arts is enough to qualify as a superpower, and none are more &quot;super&quot; at the art of fighting than Iron Fist, and as #46 on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Avengers&quot;.

===Controversy===
The story of Iron Fist has been criticized for cultural appropriation, orientalism and reinforcing a white savior narrative, with Rob Bricken of &quot;io9&quot; summarizing Danny Rand as a clichéd &quot;white guy [who] discovers a foreign culture, learns its ways, and becomes better at it than the people born into it&quot;. Upon the announcement of the television series, an online movement was started to change Iron Fist as an Asian-American character to subvert offensive tropes while providing some depth to the character. Supporters of the movement included comic writer Gail Simone, who acknowledged she was a fan of Iron Fist but agreed that the character should be changed to Asian-American. The role ultimately went to English actor Finn Jones, whose performance was panned by critics, along with the series&#x27; depiction of Asian culture during its first season.

Roy Thomas, co-creator of Iron Fist, defended the character in response to criticism, arguing that Iron Fist was created for a less &quot;PC&quot; time. While Thomas added that he would not be bothered if Iron Fist had been changed to Asian-American, he was not &quot;ashamed&quot; for making Rand white. Comic book creator Rob Liefeld also defended the character, denying that Rand&#x27;s story was racist and argued that changing his race to Asian was &quot;reverse whitewashing&quot;. Other commentators have echoed similar sentiments; while acknowledging that Rand&#x27;s origins were problematic, some felt that changing him to Asian would reinforce the stereotype of Asians being proficient in martial arts.

In an apparent response to the controversy, Marvel announced in 2021 that a new, younger Iron Fist of Asian descent would be introduced in a new comic series helmed by an Asian creative team. Writer Alyssa Wong explained that it was &quot;impossible to be unaware of the controversy&quot;, and took this into consideration when writing the series. While noting that there had been Iron Fists of Asian descent before, Wong pointed out that all of them were supporting characters in Rand&#x27;s story or long dead, arguing that the new Iron Fist was an important step forward for the title and the ongoing push for diversity. Wong also acknowledged Rand&#x27;s sizeable fanbase despite criticisms, reassuring that he would play an important role for the new Iron Fist and that the new series would not &quot;erase&quot; Rand&#x27;s history and legacy but instead build upon it. The new series, which revealed the Chinese superhero Sword Master as the new Iron Fist, has since received critical acclaim.

In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to co-finance an Iron Fist film, hiring Ray Park to star and John Turman to write the script in January 2001. In preparation, Park extensively read the comics that Iron Fist had appeared in. Kirk Wong signed to direct in July 2001, with filming set for late 2001/early 2002. &quot;Iron Fist&quot; nearly went into pre-production in March 2002, but Wong left the project in April 2002. By August 2002, pre-production had started. Filming was pushed back to late 2002, and then to late 2003. In March 2003, Marvel announced a 2004 release date. In April 2003, Steve Carr entered negotiations to direct. In November 2003, the release date was moved to 2006. In March 2007, Carr placed &quot;Iron Fist&quot; on hold due to scheduling conflicts.

<text>Joaquim José da Silva Xavier (; 12 November 1746 – 21 April 1792), known as Tiradentes (), was a leading member of the colonial Brazilian revolutionary movement known as the Inconfidência Mineira, whose aim was full independence from Portuguese rule and the creation of a republic. When the conspirators plot was uncovered by authorities, Tiradentes was arrested, tried and publicly hanged.

Since the advent of the Brazilian Republic, Tiradentes has been considered a national hero of Brazil and patron of the Military Police.

== Early life==

Tiradentes was born on the Fazenda do Pombal, near the village of Santa Rita do Rio Abaixo, at the time disputed territory between the towns of São João del-Rei and Tiradentes, in the Captaincy of Minas Gerais.

Joaquim José da Silva Xavier was the fourth of seven children of Portuguese-born Domingos da Silva Santos and of Brazilian-born Antônia da Encarnação Xavier.

According to his mother&#x27;s 1757 inventory, there were 35 slaves on the family&#x27;s large fazenda of Pombal, where they also worked as miners. A porch provided external access to an oratory, and there were slave quarters and communal kitchens. A large and valuable quantity of mining equipment was also listed in the inventory.

In 1755 after the death of his mother, he went with his father and brothers to the town of São José. Two years later, when he was 11 years old, his father died. With the premature death of his parents, his family soon lost its property due to debt. Having received no regular education, he entered under the tutelage of his uncle and godfather Sebastião Ferreira Leitão, who was a dentist. He worked as a peddler and a miner, and he became a partner in a pharmacy in Vila Rica. He dedicated himself to pharmaceutical practices and dentistry, which earned him the nickname &quot;Tiradentes&quot;. &quot;Tiradentes&quot; means &quot;tooth puller&quot;, a pejorative denomination adopted during the trial against him. According to Brother Raimundo de Penaforte, Tiradentes &quot;adorned his mouth with new teeth which he made himself that seemed natural&quot;. He also occasionally worked as a doctor in light of knowledge about medicinal plants acquired with his cousin, Brother José Mariano da Conceição Veloso, a celebrated botanist of the time.

==Political ideas==

Tiradentes used knowledge he acquired about minerals while working as a miner to enter the public service as a terrain surveyor.

He later joined the Minas Gerais Dragoon Regiment, where he was given command of a detachment and sent on missions to cities along &quot;Caminho Novo&quot;, a road between Vila Rica (then capital of Minas Gerais) and Rio de Janeiro through which gold was sent to the coast, ultimately to be shipped to Portugal.

Over time, witnessing the transit of goods along Caminho Novo, Tiradentes started to perceive the massive exportation of gold and other valuable resources to the metropolis as exploitation to which Brazilians were subjected. He also grew dissatisfied with his relatively low rank: not a member of the local aristocracy, he was systematically overlooked for promotion, never rising above &quot;alferes&quot; (the lowest officer rank at the time), and was eventually dismissed from his commanding post.
His trips to Rio put him in contact with people who had lived in Europe and brought liberal ideas from there.

In 1788, Tiradentes met , a son of Vila Rica&#x27;s army&#x27;s commandant who had just returned from England. Contrasting British industrial progress with Brazilian colonial poverty, the two decided to create a group of freedom aspirants. Led by clerics and other Brazilians with some social presence, like Cláudio Manuel da Costa, Tomás Antônio Gonzaga (both public servants and renowned writers) and Alvarenga Peixoto (eminent businessman), the group propagated their ideas among the people.

At the time, Portugal&#x27;s demand for gold was high. However, productivity of Brazilian mines was declining. The colony was failing to meet the &quot;quinto&quot; – the quota of gold demanded by the Crown – and pressure from the metropolis rose. This culminated in the creation of the &quot;derrama&quot;, a heavily confiscatory tribute that, in turn, further stirred seditious sentiments.

Influenced by the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the American Revolution, Tiradentes joined a number of like-minded citizens in the Inconfidência Mineira, a revolutionary movement. They envisioned an independent Brazilian republic, with São João del Rei as its capital and the conversion of Vila Rica to a university town. The proposed flag for the new republic had a green triangle over a white background, surrounded by the Latin motto &quot;Libertas Quae Sera Tamen&quot; (&quot;Freedom, Even If It Be Late&quot;).

==Discovery, trial and execution==

Tiradentes&#x27;s plan was to take to the streets of Vila Rica and proclaim a Brazilian Republic on the day of the &quot;derrama&quot;, in February 1789, when tax was due to Portugal and the sentiment of revolt among Brazilians would be stronger. Joaquim Silvério dos Reis, one of the conspirators, exposed the plot in exchange for a tax waiver. The governor of Minas Gerais cancelled the &quot;derrama&quot; and ordered the imprisonment of the rebels.

A trial was carried, lasting almost three years. Tiradentes was sentenced to death, along with ten other &quot;inconfidentes&quot;. Queen Maria I of Portugal later commuted the sentences of capital punishment to perpetual banishment for all convicts, except those whose activities involved aggravated circumstances. Such was the case of Tiradentes, who took full responsibility for the movement.

He was imprisoned in Rio, then hanged on 21 April 1792. Afterwards, his body was quartered and the pieces were sent to Vila Rica, to be displayed in places where he used to propagate his liberal ideas. His head landed in Ouro Preto but was subsequently lost.

==National hero==
Tiradentes began to be considered a national hero by the republicans in the late 19th century. After the institution of the Republic, in 1889, the anniversary of his death became a national holiday.

His moniker, &quot;Tiradentes&quot;, became the namesake of a city in the state of Minas Gerais, of city squares in Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Ouro Preto, as well as of a major avenue in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

The 11th Mountain Infantry Battalion, &quot;Tiradentes&quot; Regiment (&quot;11º Batalhão de Infantaria de Montanha, Regimento &quot;Tiradentes&quot;&quot;), named after the hero, is currently operational in the Brazilian Army.

<text>The 1980 UEFA European Football Championship finals tournament was held in Italy. This was the sixth UEFA European Championship, which is held every four years and endorsed by UEFA. It was the first European Championship to feature eight teams in the finals, which took place between 11 and 22 June 1980. West Germany won the final 2–1 against Belgium for their second title. This was the last European Championship with a third place play-off.

==Bid process==
This was the first European Championship in which eight teams, rather than four, contested the finals tournament. On 17 October 1977 UEFA announced that England, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Switzerland and West Germany had expressed interest in hosting this event. On 19 October UEFA&#x27;s Organising Committee decided to assign the hosting to England or Italy (expressing its favour to the latter, the former having already hosted the FIFA World Cup just 14 years earlier), and on 12 November the Organising Committee and the Executive Committee announced that Italy had been chosen unanimously. Seven countries had to qualify for the finals, and the draw for the qualifying round took place in Rome on 30 November 1977. Also for the first time, the hosts, in this case Italy, qualified automatically for the finals.

==Overview==
Because of the expanded format, the finals tournament went through some changes as well. Two groups of four teams each were created; each team would play all others within their group. The winners of the groups would qualify directly for the final (there were no semi-finals), while the runners-up contested the third place play-off.

The tournament failed to draw much enthusiasm from spectators and TV viewers. Attendance was generally poor except for matches involving the Italian team. The tournament format, which required a team to win their group in order to progress to the final, led to a succession of dull, defensive matches. Hooliganism, already a rising problem in the 1970s, made headlines again at the first-round match between England and Belgium where riot police had to use tear gas, causing the match to be held up for five minutes in the first half. The only bright spots were the emergence of a new generation of talented German stars such as Bernd Schuster, Hans-Peter Briegel, Horst Hrubesch, Hansi Müller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, and the inspirational performance of Belgium (around rising stars such as Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets, Jean-Marie Pfaff, and Erwin Vandenbergh) who reached the final, only losing to West Germany (2–1) by a Hrubesch goal two minutes before time.

==Qualification==

Greece made their major tournament debut. Spain and Italy made their first appearances since their wins in 1964 and 1968, respectively. England also qualified for the first time since 1968. Belgium qualified after missing the 1976 tournament. Yugoslavia did not qualify after hosting the previous tournament. Other notable absentees were the USSR, France, and Hungary. This was the last time until 2008 that Denmark failed to qualify. 
===Qualified teams===


==Venues==
==Squads==
Each national team had to submit a squad of 22 players.

==Match officials==
==Group stage==
The teams finishing in the top position in each of the two groups progress to the finals, while the second placed teams advanced to the third place play-off, and bottom two teams were eliminated from the tournament.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;

===Tiebreakers===
If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:
# Goal difference in all group matches
# Greater number of goals scored in all group matches
# Drawing of lots

===Group 1===

----
----

===Group 2===

----
----

==Knockout stage==
In the final, extra time and a penalty shoot-out were used to decide the winner if necessary. However, the third place play-off would go straight to a penalty shoot-out if the scores were level after 90 minutes.

&quot;All times are local, CEST (UTC+2).&quot;
