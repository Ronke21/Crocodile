<text>Hobart and William Smith Colleges are private liberal arts colleges in Geneva, New York. They trace their origins to Geneva Academy established in 1797. Students can choose from 45 majors and 68 minors with degrees in Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts in Teaching, Master of Science in Management, and Master of Arts in Higher Education Leadership. 

The colleges were originally separate institutions – Hobart College for men and William Smith College for women – that shared close bonds and a contiguous campus. Founded as Geneva College in 1822, Hobart College was renamed in honor of its founder John Henry Hobart, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York in 1852. William Smith College was founded in 1908 by Geneva philanthropist and nurseryman William Smith. They are officially chartered as &quot;Hobart and William Smith Colleges&quot; and informally referred to as &quot;HWS&quot; or &quot;the Colleges&quot;. Although united in one corporation with many shared resources and overlapping organizations, they have each retained their traditions. 

Today, students are free to participate in each of the colleges&#x27; customs and traditions based on their preferred gender identities. Students can graduate with diplomas issued by Hobart College, William Smith College, or Hobart and William Smith Colleges.

==History==

Hobart and William Smith Colleges, private colleges in Geneva, New York, began on the western frontier as the Geneva Academy. After some setbacks and disagreement among trustees, the academy suspended operations in 1817. By the time Bishop John Henry Hobart, of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, first visited the city of Geneva in 1818, the doors of Geneva Academy had just closed. Yet, Geneva was a bustling Upstate New York city on the main land and stage coach route to the West. Bishop Hobart had a plan to reopen the academy at a new location, raise a public subscription for the construction of a stone building, and elevate the school to college status. Roughly following this plan, Geneva Academy reopened as Geneva College in 1822 with conditional grant funds made available from Trinity Church in New York City. Geneva College was renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, Bishop Hobart.

William Smith College was founded in 1908, originally as William Smith College for Women. Its namesake and founder was a wealthy local nurseryman, benefactor of the arts and sciences, and philanthropist. The school arose from negotiations between William Smith, who sought to establish a women&#x27;s college, and Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson, who sought to redirect Smith&#x27;s philanthropy toward Hobart College. Smith, however, was intent on establishing a coordinated, nonsectarian women&#x27;s college, which, when realized, coincidentally gave Hobart access to new facilities and professors. The two student bodies were educated separately in the early years, even though William Smith College was a department of Hobart College for organizational purposes until 1943. That year, after a gradual relaxation of academic separation, William Smith College was formally recognized as an independent college, co-equal with Hobart. Both colleges were reflected in a new, joint corporate identity.

==Early history and growth==

===Geneva Academy===
Geneva Academy was founded in 1796 when Geneva was just a small frontier settlement. It is believed to be the first school formed in Geneva. The area was considered &quot;the gateway to Genesee County&quot; and was in the early stages of development from the wilderness.

In 1809, the trustees of the academy appointed Rev. Andrew Wilson, formerly of the University of Glasgow in Scotland as head of the school. He remained until 1812 when Ransom Hubell, a graduate of Union College, was made principal.

===Geneva College===
The Regents granted the full charter on February 8, 1825, and at that time, Geneva Academy officially changed its name to Geneva College. Rev. J. Adams was president of the college as of 1827.

The &quot;English Course,&quot; as it was known, was a radical departure from long-established educational usage and represented the beginning of the college work pattern found today.

=== Geneva Medical College ===
Geneva Medical College was founded on September 15, 1834, as a department of Geneva College. The medical school was founded by Edward Cutbush, who also served as the first dean of the school.

==== Elizabeth Blackwell ====
In an era when the prevailing conventional wisdom was no woman could withstand the intellectual and emotional rigors of medical education, Elizabeth Blackwell, (1821–1910) applied to and was rejected – or simply ignored – by 29 medical schools before being admitted in 1847 to the Medical Institution of Geneva College.

The medical faculty, largely opposed to her admission but seemingly unwilling to take responsibility for the decision, decided to submit the matter to a vote of the students. The men of the college voted to admit her.

Blackwell graduated two years later, on January 23, 1849, at the top of her class to become the first woman doctor in the Northern Hemisphere. &quot;The occasion marked the culmination of years of trial and disappointment for Miss Blackwell, and was a key event in the struggle for the emancipation of women in the nineteenth century in America.&quot;

Blackwell went on to found the New York Infirmary for Women and Children and had a role in the creation of its medical college. She then returned to her native England and helped found the National Health Society and taught at the first college of medicine for women to be established there.

===Hobart College===
The school was known as Geneva College until 1852, when it was renamed in memory of its most forceful advocate and founder, Bishop Hobart, to Hobart Free College. In 1860, the name was shortened to Hobart College.

Hobart College of the 19th century was the first American institution of higher learning to establish a three-year &quot;English Course&quot; of study to educate young men destined for such practical occupations as &quot;journalism, agriculture, merchandise, mechanism, and manufacturing&quot;, while at the same time maintaining a traditional four-year &quot;classical course&quot; for those intending to enter &quot;the learned professions.&quot; It also was the first college in America to have a dean of the college.

Notable 19th-century alumni included Albert James Myer, Class of 1847, a military officer assigned to run the United States Weather Bureau at its inception, was a founding member of the International Meteorological Organization, and helped birth the U.S. Signal Corps, and for whom Fort Myer, Virginia, is named; General E. S. Bragg of the Class of 1848, colonel of the Sixth Wisconsin Regiment and a brigadier general in command of the Iron Brigade who served one term in Congress and later was ambassador to Mexico and consul general of the U.S. in Cuba; two other 1848 graduates, Clarence A. Seward and Thomas M. Griffith, who were assistant secretary of state and builder of the first national railroad across the Mississippi River, respectively; and Charles J. Folger, Class of 1836, a United States Secretary of the Treasury in the 1880s.

Until the mid-20th century, Hobart was strongly affiliated with the Episcopal Church and produced many of its clergy. While this affiliation continues to the present, the last Episcopal clergyman to serve as President of Hobart (1956–1966) was Louis Melbourne Hirshson. Since then, the president of the colleges has been a layperson.

During World War II, Hobart College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

===William Smith College===
Toward the end of the 19th century, Hobart College was on the brink of bankruptcy. It was through the presidency of Langdon Stewardson the college obtained a new donor, nurseryman William Smith. Smith had built the Smith Opera House in downtown Geneva and the Smith Observatory on his property when he became interested in founding a college for women, a plan he pursued to the point of breaking ground before realizing it was beyond his means. As publicized in &quot;The College Signal&quot; on October 7, 1903, &quot;William Smith, a millionaire nurseryman, will found and endow a college for women at Geneva, N. Y., to be known as the William Smith College for Women The institution will be in the most beautiful section. One building is to cost $150,000. Mr. Smith maintains the Smith observatory there.&quot; In 1903, Hobart College President Langdon C. Stewardson learned of Smith&#x27;s interest and, for two years, attempted to convince him to make Hobart College the object of his philanthropy. With enrollments down and its resources strained, Hobart&#x27;s future depended upon an infusion of new funds.

Unable to convince Smith to provide direct assistance to Hobart, President Stewardson redirected the negotiations toward founding a coordinated institution for women, a plan that appealed to the philanthropist. On December 13, 1906, he formalized his intentions; two years later William Smith School for Women – a coordinated, nonsectarian women&#x27;s college – enrolled its first class of 18 students. That charter class grew to 20 members before its graduation in 1912.

In addition, Smith&#x27;s gift made possible the construction of the Smith Hall of Science, to be used by both colleges, and permitted the hiring, also in 1908, of three new faculty members who would teach in areas previously unavailable in the curriculum: biology, sociology, and psychology.

===World War II===
Between 1943 and 1945, Hobart College trained almost 1,000 men in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s V-12 program, many of whom returned to complete their college educations when the post-World War II GI Bill swelled the enrollments of American colleges and universities. In 1948, three of those veterans – William F. Scandling, Harry W. Anderson, and W. P. Laughlin – took over the operation of the Hobart dining hall. Their fledgling business was expanded the next year to include William Smith College; after their graduation, in 1949, it grew to serve other colleges and universities across the country, eventually becoming Saga Corporation, a nationwide provider of institutional food services.

=== 1970 Coercion charges ===
Students and faculty of Hobart and William Smith Colleges were active during the anti-war movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. On April 30, 1970, a group of first-year students threw three Molotov cocktails through the windows of the Air Force ROTC office located on the first floor of Sherrill Hall. The incident was incited by &quot;Tommy the Traveler&quot; an agent provocateur who worked for the Ontario County Police Department and the FBI. No one was injured and no significant damage was done to Sherrill Hall. In July of that year, the colleges were officially indicted on coercion charges in a landmark case in the history of higher education in the United States. The incident marks the first time in U.S. history that a college has been charged with criminal activities relating to a campus disorder. The colleges were acquitted of all charges. 

=== 2014 Title IX investigation ===
On May 1, 2014, the U.S. Department of Education released a list of 55 colleges being investigated for potential violations of federal law regarding sexual assault and harassment complaints. The list included Hobart and William Smith Colleges. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article published in July of the same year detailed a case in which a student reported a sexual assault by three college football players two weeks into her first year; within two weeks the college&#x27;s investigation cleared the two men accused, despite medical evidence, a corroborating witness to one of the incidents and discrepancies in the alleged perpetrators&#x27; accounts of the evening. The story also alleged the members of the disciplinary panel that heard the case were uninformed about sexual assault and frequently changed the subject rather than hear the victim&#x27;s account of events. Following the report, the colleges unveiled new initiatives and policies, including revising their sexual violence policies, creating a rape hotline and forming an Office of Title IX Programs and Compliance.

==Campus==


=== Layout ===

Hobart and William Smith Colleges&#x27; campus is situated on in Geneva, New York, along the shore of Seneca Lake, the largest of the Finger Lakes. The campus is notable for the style of Jacobean Gothic architecture represented by many of its buildings, notably Coxe Hall, which houses the President&#x27;s Office and other administrative departments. In contrast, the earliest buildings were built in the Federal style and the chapel is Neo-Gothic.

The Quad, the core of the Hobart campus, was formed by the construction of Medbery, Coxe, and Demarest. Several years later, Arthur Nash, a Hobart professor, designed Williams Hall, which would be constructed in the gap between Medbery and Coxe. The Quad is formed to the east by Trinity and Geneva Hall, the two original College buildings, and to the south by the Science compound, and Napier Hall. Geneva Hall (1822) and Trinity Hall (1837) were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 2016, the schools announced they were going solar by building two solar farms to create enough electricity for about 50 percent of HWS&#x27; needs.

The Hill (or William Smith Hill) is a prominent feature of the historic William Smith campus. Located at the top of a large sloping hill to the West of Seneca Lake and the Hobart Quad, the Hill houses three historic William Smith dorms and one built in the 1960s (Comstock, Miller, Blackwell, and Hirshson Houses). At its peak resides William Smith&#x27;s all-female dorms. The Hill was the site originally conceived for William Smith College. Unveiled in 2008 for the William Smith Centennial is a statue of the college&#x27;s founder and benefactor, William Smith.

A fifteen-million-dollar expansion of the Scandling Campus Center was completed in the autumn of 2008. This renovation added over 17,000 additional square feet, including an expanded cafe, a new post office, and more meeting areas. In 2016 the Gearan Center for Performing Arts was completed for 28 million dollars, becoming the largest project in the history of the college.



=== Key buildings ===

Coxe Hall serves as the main administrative hub of the campus. Constructed in 1901, the building is named after Bishop Arthur Cleveland Coxe, a benefactor of the school, and houses the president&#x27;s office, Bartlett Theater, The Pub, and a classroom wing, which was added in the 1920s. Arthur Cleveland Coxe was closely affiliated with the school. The building was designed by Clinton and Russell Architects.

Gearan Center for the Performing Arts, named in honor of President Mark D Gearan and Mary Herlihy Gearan, was in 2016. It includes a lobby that links three flexible performance and rehearsal spaces for theater, music, and dance. Also included are faculty offices, practice and recital rooms, and a film screening room.

Scandling Campus Center, named after William F. Scandling &#x27;49, renovated and expanded in 2009, houses Saga (the dining hall), the post office, offices of student activities, a cafe, and Vandervort room (a large event space).

Gulick Hall was built in 1951 as part of the post-war &quot;mini-boom&quot; that also included the construction of the Hobart &quot;mini-quad&quot; dormitories Durfee, Bartlett, and Hale (each named for a 19th-century Hobart College president). Gulick Hall originally housed the campus dining services and, later, the Office of the Registrar. Completely renovated in 1991, Gulick now houses both the Office of the Registrar and the Psychology department, which was moved from Smith Hall in 1991 before its renovation in 1992.

Stern Hall, named for the lead donor, Herbert J. Stern &#x27;58, was completed in 2004. It houses the departments of economics, political science, anthropology &amp; sociology, environmental studies, and Asian languages and cultures.

Smith Hall, built in 1907, originally housed both the Biology and Psychology Departments. It is now home to the Dean&#x27;s Offices of both colleges, along with the departmental offices of Writing and Rhetoric and the various modern language departments. Smith Hall was the first building constructed with funds from William Smith on the William Smith College campus, but it is also the first building that has always been shared by both colleges.

Williams Hall, completed in 1907, housed the first campus gymnasium and, after the construction of Bristol gymnasium, served several other uses as a campus post office, book store, IT services, and location of the Music Department.

Demarest Hall, connected to St. John&#x27;s Chapel by St. Mark&#x27;s Tower, houses the departments of Religious Studies and English and Comparative Literature as well as the Women&#x27;s Studies Program. Also home to the Blackwell Room, named in honor of Elizabeth Blackwell (once used as a study area and library, the space is now used for classrooms in the absence of more planning for classroom space), Demarest was designed by Richard Upjohn&#x27;s son, Richard M. Upjohn. (Upjohn&#x27;s grandson, Hobart Upjohn would design several of the college&#x27;s buildings as well). Demarest served as the college&#x27;s library until the construction of the Warren Hunting Smith Library in the early 1970s. In the 1960s it was expanded to hold the college&#x27;s growing number of volumes. Today, it also houses the Fisher Center for the Study of Gender and Justice, an intellectual center led by such scholar faculty as Dunbar Moodie (Sociology), Betty Bayer (Women&#x27;s Studies), and Jodi Dean (Political Science).

Trinity Hall built in 1837, was the second of the colleges&#x27; buildings. Trinity Hall was designed by college president Benjamin Hale, who taught architecture. Trinity served as a dormitory and a library, but it was converted into a space for classrooms, labs, and offices later in the 19th century. It presently is home to the Salisbury Center for Career Services.

Merrit Hall, completed in 1879, was built on the ruins of the old medical college. Merrit was the first science building on campus and housed the chemistry labs. Merrit also housed a clock atop the quad side of the building. On the eve of the Hobart centennial in 1922, students climbed to the top and made the bell strike 100 times. Merrit Hall was also one of the first buildings shared by Hobart and William Smith. Today Merrit Hall houses a lecture hall and faculty offices.
St. John&#x27;s Chapel, designed by Richard Upjohn the architect of Trinity Church in New York City, served as the religious hub of the campus, replacing Polynomous, the original campus chapel. In the 1960s, St. John&#x27;s was connected to Demarest Hall by St. Marks Tower.

Houghton House, the mansion, known for its Victorian elements, is home to the Art and Architecture departments. The country mansion was built, in the 1880s by William J. King. It was purchased in 1901 by the wife of Charles Vail (maiden name Helen Houghton), Hobart graduate and professor, as the family&#x27;s summer home. Mrs. Vail remodeled the Victorian mansion&#x27;s interior to the present classical decor in 1913. The family&#x27;s &quot;townhome&quot; is 624 S. Main Street and is now the Sigma Phi fraternity. Helen Vail&#x27;s heirs donated the house and its grounds to the colleges to be used as a women&#x27;s dormitory. After many years as a student dorm, the house became home to the art department after the original art studio was razed to make way for the new Scandling Campus Center. The building is now home to the Davis Art Gallery, with lecture rooms, multiple faculty offices, and architecture studios on the top floor.

Katherine D. Elliot Hall, was constructed in 2006. The &quot;Elliot&quot; houses contain art classrooms; offices; studios for painting, photography, and printing; and wood and metal shops.

Goldstein Family Carriage House was built by William J. King in 1882 and was renovated in 2006 to house a digital imaging lab and a photo studio with a darkroom for black-and-white photography.

Warren Hunting Smith Library, in the center of the campus, houses 385,000 volumes, 12,000 periodicals, and more than 8,000 VHS and DVD videos. In 1997, the library underwent a major renovation, undergoing several improvements, such as the addition of multimedia centers, and the addition to its south side of the L. Thomas Melly Academic Center, a spacious, modern location for &quot;round the clock&quot; study.

Napier Hall, attached to the Rosenberg Hall, houses several classrooms and was completed in 1994.

Rosenberg Hall, named for Henry A. Rosenberg (Hobart &#x27;52), is an annex of Lansing and Eaton Hall, the original science buildings. Rosenberg houses many labs and offices.

Lansing Hall, built in 1954, is home to Sciences and Mathematics. The building is named after John Ernest Lansing, Professor of Chemistry (1905–1948), who twice served as acting president.

Eaton Hall, is named for Elon Howard Eaton, a Professor of Biology (1908–1935). Eaton, one of New York&#x27;s outstanding ornithologists, was one of the professors brought to campus with William Smith grant funds. Eaton Hall is a part of the science complex at the south end of the Hobart Quad, which consists of Lansing, Rosenberg, and Napier.

===Dormitories===
==== Men&#x27;s dorms ====

* Geneva Hall, built in 1822, is the college&#x27;s first building, and the cornerstone site designated by the School&#x27;s founder, Bishop John Henry Hobart. The building is one of the oldest academic buildings in continuous use, having served as a dormitory, among other uses, since its completion. The building has inscribed into its quoins, and alongside the perimeter of its facade, plaques that list the graduates of classes dating back to the 19th century.
* The Mini Quad, consisting of three buildings, Durfee, Hale, and Bartlett, houses about 150 Hobart students. Since the 2006 academic year, the dorms have become coeducational, with at least one-floor housing William Smith Students.
* Hale Hall is named for Benjamin Hale, president of Hobart College from 1836 to 1858.
* Bartlett Hall was named after the Reverend Murray Bartlett, who served as the fourteenth president of Hobart College from 1919 to 1936
* Durfee Hall was named after William Pitt Durfee, who from 1884 to 1929 served as Professor of Mathematics and Chair of the Mathematics Department. He was the first dean of a liberal arts college and served as acting president of the college four times.

==== Women&#x27;s dorms ====

* Blackwell House was designed and built in 1860 by Richard Upjohn as a residence for William Douglass, who served as a trustee of Hobart College. The house was purchased in 1908 as the first William Smith dormitory. The house still houses William Smith students and is known for its grand Victorian features from fireplaces to chandeliers, to large old windows. Though rarely recognized as such, the house is named for Elizabeth Blackwell, an early graduate of what became the colleges.
* Comstock House was designed by Richard Upjohn&#x27;s grandson, Hobart Upjohn, in 1932. Comstock is a women&#x27;s dormitory named for Anna Botsford Comstock, a friend of William Smith and the first woman to be named a member of the board of trustees.
* Miller House was William Smith College&#x27;s second dormitory. Miller was designed by Arthur Nash, professor and grandson of Arthur Cleveland Coxe. Nash also designed Smith Hall and Williams Hall. This house honors Elizabeth Smith Miller, a leader in the women&#x27;s movement.
* Hirshson House, completed in 1962, was named for the president of the colleges, Louis Melbourne Hirshson, the last Episcopal clergy person to serve in that capacity. The building is home to William Smith students.

==== Coed dorms ====

* Medbery Hall is an original Hobart College dorm dating from the 1900. Medbery defines the right side of the Hobart Quadrangle. Designed by Clinton and Russell architects at the same time as Coxe Hall, the two buildings share similarities in their Jacobean Gothic style. Medbery is adorned with a recognizable Flemish roofline. Medbery was designed without long hallways &quot;conducive to rioting&quot; and mischief, such as rolling a cannonball down the hallway. Such mischief was experienced in the other two dormitories on campus, Geneva and Trinity Halls.
* Jackson, Potter, Rees, together known as JPR for short (and once dubbed &quot;superdorm&quot;), the three identical buildings create their quad in the south end of campus. The dorms were built in 1966 and are named after various historical figures of Hobart College. The complex houses about 230 first-year and upper-class Hobart and William Smith students. The building was completely renovated in 2005 to include quad living spaces (two double bedrooms connected by a common living room) and open lounge spaces and lounges on every floor.
* Jackson Hall is named for Abner Jackson, president of the Hobart in the middle of the 19th century. Jackson would go on to become president of Trinity College in Connecticut, where he would be the principal designer of its present campus.
* Rees Hall is named for Major James Rees, an early settler and landowner in Geneva and an acquaintance of George Washington.
* Potter Hall is named for John Milton Potter, President of Hobart and William Smith Colleges from 1942 to 1947.
* The Village at Odell&#x27;s Pond is a collection of apartment-style dorms available to upperclassmen at the colleges. The units have either four or five bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a living room, and a kitchen.
* Emerson Hall was built in 1969. The rooms are designed as suites, with two doubles and two singles and a common living room and bathroom.
* Caird Hall was built, along with deCordova, in 2005. The dorm has provisions for singles, doubles, and quads, and is often desired by students due to the separate temperature controls in each room. The ground floor hosts a lounge area with both gaming and fitness equipment for students.
* deCordova Hall was built, along with Caird, in 2005. The dorm has provisions for singles, doubles, and quads, and separate temperature controls in each room. The ground floor has a lounge area for students, as well as the deCordova cafe. 

The surrounding ecosystem plays a major role in the colleges&#x27; curriculum and acquisitions. The colleges own the Hanley Biological Field Station and Preserve on neighboring Cayuga Lake and hosts the Finger Lakes Institute, a non-profit institute focusing on education and ecological preservation for the Finger Lakes area.

On Seneca Lake, one will find the &quot;William Scandling&quot;, a Hobart and William Smith research vessel used to monitor lake conditions and in the conduct of student and faculty research.

The colleges also own and operate WEOS-FM and WHWS-LP, public radio stations broadcasting throughout the Finger Lakes and worldwide, on the web.

==Academics==
Hobart and William Smith Colleges offer the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Master of Arts in Teaching. The colleges follow the semester calendar, have a student-to-faculty ratio of 10:1, and average class size of 16. Hobart and William Smith Colleges was accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools until 2023. It is now accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

=== Curriculum ===

The curriculum was last reviewed and revised in the 2014–15 academic year. Voted on by the faculty, the curriculum adopted the animating principle: Explore. Collaborate. Act. The revisions also adopted a Writing Enriched Curriculum model, the implementation of capstone experiences across all programs and departments, and enhanced the First Year Experience. Specifically, to graduate from Hobart and William Smith Colleges, students must:
*Pass 32 academic courses, including a First-Year Seminar
*Complete the requirements for an academic major, including a capstone course or experience, and an academic minor (or second major). Students cannot major and minor in the same subject.
*Complete a course of study, designed in consultation with a faculty adviser, which addresses each of the eight educational goals:
# Critical Thinking
# Communication
# Quantitative Reasoning
# Scientific Inquiry
# Artistic Process
# Social Inequalities
# Cultural Difference
# Ethical Judgment

=== First-Year Seminar ===
First-Year Seminars are discussion-centered, interdisciplinary and collaborative. The only required course at HWS, seminar classes are small – usually about 15 students. They are intended to help students:
# Develop critical thinking and communication skills
# Understand the colleges’ intellectual and ethical values
# Establish a strong network of relationships with peers and mentors

Seminar topics vary each year, as do the professors who teach them. Many First-Year Seminars are linked to a learning community. Students enrolled in a learning community take one or more courses together. They also live together on the same floor of a co-ed residence hall and attend some of the same lectures and field trips.

=== Global education ===
More than 60% of Hobart and William Smith students participate in off-campus study before they graduate. The colleges offer study abroad sites on 6 continents with courses available in many academic disciplines. Admission to these programs is competitive.

Merwin, and Eavan Boland, &quot;Seneca Review&quot; also consistently publishes emerging writers. In 1997, &quot;Seneca Review&quot; began publishing the &quot;lyric essay,&quot; creative nonfiction that borders on poetry, under the associate editorship of John D&#x27;Agata.

&quot;Echo and Pine&quot; is the annual student-produced college yearbook. Originally two separate publications, the &quot;Hobart Echo&quot; of Seneca, and the &quot;William Smith Pine&quot;, the two merged in the 1960s to create one publication to serve both colleges. &quot;The Herald&quot; is the student-run school newspaper, founded in the late 19th century as the &quot;Hobart Herald&quot;. &quot;The Pulteney St. Survey&quot; is the official magazine of Hobart and William Smith Colleges. &quot;martini&quot; is the alternative student publication at Hobart &amp; William Smith Colleges featuring an oftentimes witty and critical look at music, politics, and social issues on both the colleges&#x27; campus and on the national level.

&quot;Thel&quot; provides an outlet for HWS student artists and writers. The bi-annual, student-run publication features poetry, photography, visual art, and short stories created by HWS students. The &quot;Aleph&quot; is a journal that expresses global perspectives by conveying the insights of HWS and Union College students who studied abroad in joint programs as well as international and exchange students from both campuses. The journal is sponsored by the Hobart and William Smith Colleges and Union College Partnership for Global Education.

=== Debate ===
The HWS Debate Team dates back over 100 years. Notable recent victories include the 2016 Cornell IV, the 2015 Brad Smith Debate Tournament @ University of Rochester, the 2012 US National Championships, and the 2012 and 2009 Northeastern Regional Championship. The team hosts the HWS IV (one of the largest tournaments in North America) each fall, and the HWS Round Robin (an international tournament of champions) each spring. Every year, an HWS debater is honored with the Nathan D. Lapham Prize in Public Speaking, which comes with a cash award of up to $1000 to the student. HWS is among the few liberal arts colleges to offer numerous four-year debate scholarships.

===Music===

Hobart and William Smith has several ensemble groups, including:

* Colleges Chorale, a mixed ensemble that performs a wide range of a cappella choral repertoire — music from the Middle Ages to the present. In addition to a formal concert at the end of each semester and the annual spring tour, the Colleges Chorale performs at various campus events throughout the year.
* Cantori is a chamber vocal ensemble comprising members from the larger Colleges Chorale. Since the group&#x27;s formation in 1993, the sixteen-member Cantori has sought to foster contemporary choral music through the Cantori Commissioning Project – the annual commissioning and performance of a new work by a deserving American composer.
* Classical Guitar Ensemble - a student group providing a performance opportunity for talented student guitarists.
* Community Chorus - students, faculty, and staff at the colleges, and members from the surrounding community. The fifty-voice ensemble performs major works from the standard repertoire as well as lesser-known works deserving wider familiarity. Recent programs have included extended works by Franz Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Gabriel Fauré, Ottorino Respighi, Sir Edward Elgar, Aaron Copland, Benjamin Britten, and Randall Thompson.
* Community Wind Ensemble - students, faculty, and staff at the colleges and members from the surrounding community. This relatively new ensemble looks forward to exploring the rich and diverse repertoire composed for wind ensemble.
* Jazz Ensemble - a student group providing a performance opportunity for talented student jazzers. Arrangements are found to accommodate a variety of instrumental combinations.
* Jazz Guitar Ensemble - a student group providing a performance opportunity for talented student jazz guitarists.
* Percussion Ensemble - a student group providing a performance opportunity for talented student percussionists, although students with minimal experience are encouraged to audition.
* String Ensemble - a student chamber group providing a performance opportunity for talented string players.
* Hobartones - Hobart College&#x27;s student-run all-male a cappella group.
* Three Miles Lost - William Smith College&#x27;s student-run all-female a cappella group
* Perfect Third - HWS&#x27;s student-run, coed a cappella group.

==Athletics==
=== Varsity sports ===
There are 30 varsity sports at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, with about 43% of students involved at the varsity level. Hobart sponsors 15 varsity programs (alpine skiing, baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, swimming &amp; diving, rowing, sailing, soccer, squash, tennis, volleyball), while William Smith also sponsors 15 varsity programs (alpine skiing, basketball, bowling, cross country, field hockey, golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, rowing, sailing, soccer, squash, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, volleyball). Hobart and William Smith varsity teams have won 24 national championships and 124 conference championships, producing 675 All-Americans and 43 Academic All-America honorees. In March 2017, Hobart and William Smith were named to the &quot;100 Best Colleges for Sports Lovers&quot; by &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

;Affiliations
The colleges compete in NCAA Division III, except men&#x27;s lacrosse, which competes in the Division I Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). The colleges&#x27; main conference affiliation is with the Liberty League with the following exceptions: Hobart ice hockey competes in the New England Hockey Conference; Hobart lacrosse competes in the A-10; and William Smith ice hockey competes in the United Collegiate Hockey Conference.

;Facilities
Hobart and William Smith recently finished construction on the Caird Center for Sports and Recreation, which is now home to most of its athletics teams.

;Football
Offensive linesman Ali Marpet, drafted in the second round, 61st overall, of the 2015 NFL draft, is the highest-drafted pick in the history of Division III football. He was three-time All-Liberty League first team (2012, 2013, 2014), and 2014 Liberty League Co-Offensive Player of the Year—the first offensive lineman in league history to be so honored.

;Field hockey
The William Smith field hockey team has captured three national championships, ascending to the top of Division III in 1992, 1997, and 2000.

;Lacrosse
The Statesmen lacrosse team has compiled fifteen national championships (1 USILA, 2 NCAA Division II, and 13 NCAA Division III).

;Sailing
The lone coed team, the HWS sailing team is a member of the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association. In 2005, the colleges won the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association Team Race National Championship and the ICSA Coed Dinghy National Championship.

;Soccer
The William Smith soccer team was the first Heron squad to capture a national championship, winning the 1988 title bout with a 1–0 victory over University of California, San Diego. William Smith won its second national championship in 2013, defeating Trinity University.

;Crew
The Hobart Crew team has also found success, earning gold medals at the Head of The Charles Regatta, the ECAC National Invitational Regatta (most recently a gold in the 2nd varsity 8+ over the &quot;Hometown Boys&quot; of WPI in 2015), and the IRA National Championships. While the Hobart Crew team has won gold in every event they have entered since the inception of rowing as a Liberty League Sport, they failed to win the team championships only once (2004.) The eventual champions, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, were known for having a large team and were only able to defeat the Statesmen by securing a win in the 2nd Varsity 8+ – the only event that Hobart did not have an entry. However, over the past few seasons, Hobart has fielded one of the most dominant 2nd Varsity 8&#x27;s in school history. The Crew Team took part in the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley, England in the summer of 1986, 1993, 1994, 2011, and most recently in the summer of 2015.
;Ice Hockey
The Hobart hockey team won its first national championship in 2023, defeating Adrian College 3-2 in overtime. Hobart repeated as national champion the following year with a win over Trinity College 2-0.

=== Mascot ===
Originally known as the Hobart Deacons, Hobart&#x27;s athletic teams became known as the &quot;Statesmen&quot; in 1936, following the football team&#x27;s season opener against Amherst College. The morning after the game, &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the team as &quot;the statesmen from Geneva,&quot; and the name stuck. The nickname for William Smith&#x27;s athletic teams comes from a contest held in 1982. Several names were submitted, but &quot;Herons&quot; was selected because of the strong and graceful birds that lived at nearby Odell&#x27;s Pond. These elegant birds frequently flew over the athletic fields as the teams were practicing.

=== Rivalries ===
Hobart&#x27;s archrival in football is Union College. Other team rivalries include Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (football, basketball); University of Rochester (football); Elmira College and Manhattanville College (hockey); Cornell University (one of the oldest in lacrosse) and St. John Fisher University, Syracuse University and Georgetown University (lacrosse); and University of Michigan (crew). William Smith has rivalries with St. Lawrence University (lacrosse, basketball, field hockey, squash), Union College (soccer, field hockey, basketball, lacrosse), Hamilton College (field hockey, basketball, and lacrosse) and Ithaca College (crew).

<text>Fighting is an established tradition in North American ice hockey, with a long history that involves many levels of amateur and professional play and includes some notable individual fights. Fights may be fought by enforcers, or &quot;goons&quot; ()—players whose role is to fight and intimidate—on a given team, and are governed by a system of unwritten rules that players, coaches, officials, and the media refer to as &quot;the code&quot;. Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants. While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of penalties on players who engage in fights.

Unique among North American professional team sports, the National Hockey League (NHL) and most minor professional leagues in North America do not eject players outright for fighting (although they may do so for more flagrant violations as part of a fight) but major European and collegiate hockey leagues do, and multi-game suspensions may be added on top of the ejection. Therefore, the vast majority of fights occur in the NHL and other North American professional leagues.

Physical play in hockey, consisting of allowed techniques such as checking and prohibited techniques such as elbowing, high-sticking, and cross-checking, is linked to fighting. Although often a target of criticism, it is a considerable draw for the sport, and some fans attend games primarily to see fights. Those who defend fighting in hockey say that it helps deter other types of rough play, allows teams to protect their star players, and creates a sense of solidarity among teammates. The debate over allowing fighting in ice hockey games is ongoing. Despite its potentially negative consequences, such as heavier enforcers (or &quot;heavyweights&quot;) knocking each other out, administrators at the professional level have no plans to eliminate fighting from the game, as most players consider it essential. Most fans and players oppose eliminating fights from professional hockey games, but considerable opposition to fighting exists, and efforts to eliminate it continue.

==History==
Fighting has been a part of ice hockey since the sport&#x27;s rise in popularity in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. There was also an influence from working-class lacrosse players, who transitioned to ice hockey when lacrosse adopted an amateur-only policy in Canada, and who were accustomed to a violently aggressive form of play. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.

In 1922, the NHL introduced Rule 56, which formally regulated fighting, or &quot;fisticuffs&quot; as it was called in the official NHL rulebook. Rather than ejecting players from the game, as was the practice in amateur and collegiate hockey, players would be given a five-minute major penalty. Rule 56 and its language also filtered down to the minor professional and junior leagues in North America. Promoters such as Tex Rickard of Madison Square Garden, who also promoted boxing events, saw financial opportunities in hockey fights and devised marketing campaigns around the rivalries between various team enforcers.

In the current NHL rulebook, the archaic reference to &quot;fisticuffs&quot; has been removed; fighting is now governed under Rule 46 in the NHL rulebook. Referees are given considerable latitude in determining what exactly constitutes a fight and what penalties are applicable to the participants. Significant modifications from the original rule involve penalties which can be assessed to a fight participant deemed to have instigated the fight and additional penalties resulting from instigating a fight while wearing a face-shield.

Although fighting was rarer from the 1920s through the 1960s, it was often brutal in nature; author Ross Bernstein said of the game&#x27;s early years that it &quot;was probably more like rugby on skates than it was modern hockey.&quot; Star players were also known to fight for themselves during the Original Six era, when fewer teams existed than in later years. However, as the NHL&#x27;s expansion in the late 1960s created more roster spots and spread star players more widely throughout the league, enforcers (who usually possess limited overall skill sets) became more common. Multiple fights during the era received significant media attention. In an NHL preseason game between the Boston Bruins and St. Louis Blues in 1969, Bruins defenceman Ted Green and Blues left wing Wayne Maki engaged in a bloody stick-swinging fight. The fight, initiated by Maki, resulted in Green sustaining a skull fracture. In 1978, World Hockey Association Birmingham Bulls enforcer Dave Hanson, known for his 11-year professional career, fought Hall of Famer Bobby Hull and in the process got Hull&#x27;s wig caught in his knuckles. The incident landed Hanson in the news, and irate Winnipeg fans attempted to assault him on his way out of the arena. Hanson appeared in the 1977 movie &quot;Slap Shot&quot;, a comedy about hockey violence.

The rise of the &quot;Broad Street Bullies&quot; in the 1973–74 and 1974–75 Philadelphia Flyers served as an example for future NHL enforcers. The average number of fights per game rose above 1.0 during the 1980s, peaking at 1.17 in 1983–84. That season, a bench-clearing brawl broke out at the end of the second period of a second-round playoff matchup between the Quebec Nordiques and the Montreal Canadiens. A second bench-clearing brawl erupted before the third period began, provoked by the announcement of penalties; a total of 252 penalty minutes were incurred and 11 players were ejected. This game is commonly referred to as the &quot;Good Friday Massacre&quot;.

North American competitive amateur leagues serve as a training ground and emulate the practices and conduct of professional leagues. Around age 12 players begin to be chosen for size and toughness, play becomes rough, and less-violent players drop out in large numbers. 34% of Toronto amateur skaters aged 12–21 reported being in at least one fist-fight during the 1975–76 season with the likelihood of fighting increasing with player age and competitive level. Coaches of the time trained players to fight in self-defence or against players who commit flagrant fouls. Players did not consider fist-fights to be , reserving this term for acts which were more likely to cause injury. Among professional players, those who refused to fight were seen as untrustworthy and a challenge to team morale and such players could gain a reputation for being easily intimidated. Those who fought excessively were seen as displaying a lack of judgement and &quot;game sense&quot;.

Many NHL teams signed enforcers to protect and fight for smaller offensive stars. Fights in the 1990s included the Brawl in Hockeytown in 1997, in which the Colorado Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings engaged in nine fights, including bouts between Darren McCarty and Claude Lemieux and goaltenders Patrick Roy and Mike Vernon. The following year, a game between the Avalanche and Red Wings involved a fight between goaltenders Chris Osgood and Roy after which they received minor, major, and game misconduct penalties. In 2004, a Philadelphia Flyers – Ottawa Senators game resulted in five consecutive brawls in the closing minutes of the game, including fights between many players who are not known as enforcers and a fight between Flyers goaltender Robert Esche and Senators goaltender Patrick Lalime. The game ended with an NHL record 419 penalty minutes, and an NHL record 20 players were ejected, leaving five players on the team benches. The officials took 90 minutes to sort out the penalties that each team had received.

By 2009–10, the number of fights in the NHL declined to .58 per game. A further decrease in the frequency of fighting happened over the next five seasons. The 2014–15 season had 0.32 fights per game, as teams placed a greater emphasis on skating ability and fewer young players became enforcers.

==Rules and penalties==

Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty. What separates these leagues from other major North American sports leagues is that they do not eject players simply for participating in a fight. However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues and in Olympic competition.

The rulebooks of the NHL and other professional leagues contain specific rules for fighting. These rules state that at the initiation of a fight, both players must definitely drop their sticks so as not to use them as a weapon. Players must also &quot;drop&quot; or shake off their protective gloves to fight bare-knuckled, as the hard leather and plastic of hockey gloves would increase the effect of landed blows. Players should not remove their own helmet before engaging in a fight due to risk of head injury or else both of the opposing players get an extra two penalty minutes. Players must also heed a referee warning to end a fight once the opponents have been separated. Failure to adhere to any of these rules results in an immediate game misconduct penalty and the possibility of fines and suspension from future games. In the NHL, when a player is fined, his lost pay goes towards the NHL emergency assistance fund. A fined coach&#x27;s lost pay goes to the NHL Foundation.

===North American professional leagues===

In the NHL, American Hockey League (AHL), ECHL, Southern Professional Hockey League, and other notable minor leagues, officials punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase &quot;five for fighting&quot;). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries to leave the bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, wrapping tape around one&#x27;s hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.

A player who commits three major penalties (including fighting) during a game is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player&#x27;s head coach. In 2014, the AHL added a major penalty counter. A player who commits ten major penalties for fighting is suspended one game, and will be suspended one game on each such penalty for his 11th to 13th, and two games for his 14th and further penalties. If the opposing fighter is also charged with an instigator penalty, the fighting major will not count towards suspension.

In 2023, the ECHL toughened the game misconduct penalty leading to ejection. The ejection penalty will now be assessed for two fighting majors in the same game, unless another player in the fight was assessed an instigator penalty. In addition, an automatic game misconduct penalty is assessed to offending fighters if a fight occurs before, during, or shortly after a face-off.

===Collegiate, European, and Olympic===
In Division I and Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hockey, the fighters are given a Game Disqualification, which is an ejection from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications during the course of a season. For example, if a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team&#x27;s next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.

Fighting is strictly prohibited in European professional hockey leagues and in Olympic ice hockey. The international rules (by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF)) specify in rule 141 – &quot;Fighting&quot; the following penalties (among others):
* Match penalty (the player is ejected from the game and another player serves 5 minutes in addition to any other penalties imposed in the penalty box) for a player who starts fisticuffs.
* Minor penalty (2 minutes) for a player who retaliates with a blow or attempted blow.
* Game misconduct penalty (ejection from the game) in addition to any other penalties for any player who is the first to intervene in fisticuffs which are already in progress.
* Double minor penalty (4 minutes), major penalty and game misconduct penalty (5 minutes and ejection from the game), or match penalty (at the discretion of the referee) for a player who continues fisticuffs after being told by officials to stop.
* Misconduct penalty (10 minutes; second misconduct penalty in one game means automatic ejection) for a player who intentionally takes off his gloves in fisticuffs.

Despite the bans, there have been fights in European leagues. In 2001, a game between the Nottingham Panthers and the Sheffield Steelers in the British Superleague saw &quot;some of the worst scenes of violence seen at a British ice hockey rink&quot;. When Sheffield enforcer Dennis Vial crosschecked Nottingham forward Greg Hadden, Panthers enforcer Barry Nieckar subsequently fought with Vial, which eventually escalated into a 36-man bench-clearing brawl. Referee Moray Hanson sent both teams to their locker rooms and delayed the game for 45 minutes while tempers cooled and the officials sorted out the penalties. Eight players and both coaches were ejected, and a British record total of 404 penalty minutes were incurred during the second period. The league handed out 30 games in suspensions to four players and Steelers&#x27; coach Mike Blaisdell and a total of £8,400 in fines. Russia&#x27;s Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) had a bench-clearing brawl between Vityaz Chekhov and Avangard Omsk in 2010. Officials were forced to abandon the game as there were only four players left. Thirty-three players and both teams&#x27; coaches were ejected, and a world record total of 707 penalty minutes were incurred during the game. The KHL imposed fines totaling 5.7 million rubles ($191,000), suspended seven players, and counted the game as a 5–0 defeat for both teams, with no points being awarded.

The Punch-up in Piestany was a notable instance of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union was the scene of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting was a surprise and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.

==Enforcers==
The role of &quot;enforcer&quot; on a hockey team is unofficial. Enforcers occasionally play regular shifts like other players, but their primary role is deterring opposing players from rough play. Coaches often send enforcers out when opposing enforcers are on the ice or any time when it is necessary to check excessively physical play by the opposing team. Enforcers, particularly those with questionable playing skills, can be colloquially referred to as goons (a term also occasionally used for a related position, the pest, who may not fight but will agitate an opponent with rough play and goad the opponent into a fight).

==Causes==
There are many reasons for fights during a hockey game. Some reasons are related to game play, such as retaliation, momentum-building, intimidation, deterrence, attempting to draw &quot;reaction penalties&quot;, and protecting star players. There are also some personal reasons such as retribution for past incidents, bad blood between players, and simple job security for enforcers. Fights often start in response to an opponent&#x27;s rough play. A North American study of 1975–1983 (the period of peak fighting) found that players used fist-fights to either &quot;stick up for oneself&quot; and save face from attempts at intimidation, or to act in self-defence from actual or perceived dirty tricks.

===Game-related reasons===
Of the many reasons for fighting, the foremost is retaliation. When players engage in play that members of the opposing team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim&#x27;s team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.

Enforcers sometimes start fights to build game momentum and provide a psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can also be a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.

Intimidation is an important element of a hockey game and some enforcers start fights just to intimidate opposing players in hopes that they will refrain from agitating skilled players. For example, in the late 1950s, Gordie Howe helped establish himself as an enforcer by defeating Lou Fontinato, a notable tough guy who tallied over 1,200 penalty minutes in his career. Fontinato suffered a broken nose from the fight. After that incident, Howe got a lot more space on the ice and was able to score many goals over the span of his career because he intimidated other players. Conversely, games in European professional leagues are known to be less violent than North American games because fighting is discouraged in Europe by ejection and heavy fines. Since the penalties for fighting are so severe, the enforcers are less able to intimidate opposing players with fighting and said players take more liberties on the ice.

For teams that face each other frequently, players may fight just to send the message to the opposing players that they will be the target of agitation or aggression in future games. Teams that are losing by a considerable margin often start these fights near the end of the game when they have nothing to lose. Enforcers may start fights with more skilled players to draw what is called a &quot;reaction penalty&quot;, an undisciplined reaction to aggressive play on the part of the enforcer. This practice is also known to be difficult due to the Instigator rule.

Another reason is the protection of star skaters and defenceless goalies. Fighting within the game can also send a message to players and coaches from other teams that cheap shots, dirty plays, and targeting specific players will not be tolerated and there will be consequences involved. Fighting can provide retribution for a team&#x27;s player getting targeted or injured. Overall, fighting is sometimes seen as a beneficial policing that the game needs to keep players in line. Over the history of hockey, many enforcers have been signed simply to protect players like Wayne Gretzky, who was protected by Dave Semenko, Marty McSorley, and others, and Brett Hull, who was protected by Kelly Chase and others. Many believe that without players protecting each other, referees would affect the gameplay by having to call more penalties, and the league would have to suspend players for longer periods.

===Personal reasons===
Many young enforcers need to establish their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get a chance to play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.

There are also times when players and even entire teams carry on personal rivalries that have little to do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason. A rivalry that produced many fights was between the Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s.

==Effect on game==
Statistical evidence indicates that fighting correlatates negatively with a given teams&#x27; success, or at least seems to have inconsequential benefits. Since the 1979–80 season, teams in the bottom three of fighting-related major penalties have finished at the top of the regular-season standings 10 times and have won the Stanley Cup 11 times, while teams in the top three have won the regular season and Stanley Cup only twice each. One statistical analysis calculated that winning a fight benefited a team by about of a win in the standings. Two others showed that fights increase scoring, but do so evenly for both teams so do not significantly affect wins.

==Efforts to ban fighting==

The Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine announced in &quot;Position Statement&quot; in 1988 that &quot;Fighting does cause injuries, which range from fractures of the hands and face to lacerations and eye injuries. At present, it is an endemic and ritualized blot on the reputation of the North American game.&quot;

Criticism often arises after single acts of violence committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight earlier in the season with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.

Sports journalists have articulated the idea with increasing frequency that fighting adds nothing to the sport and should be banned. Among the reasons they cite are that it is unsportsmanlike, is a &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reaction that detracts from the skillful aspects of the game, and that it is simply a waste of time. The &quot;Journal of Sport and Social Issues&quot;&#x27; Ryan T. Lewinson and Oscar E. Palma believe that fighting shows a lack of discipline on the part of participants, as well as a lack of fairness in certain cases, including when fighters have a size disparity. However, supporters of fighting say it provides a means of security for players, that fighting is a tool players use to keep opposing players in check; essentially allowing players to police which hits and dirty plays are unacceptable.

Various politicians and hockey figures have expressed opposition to fighting. In 2012, David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada, said that fighting should not be part of the sport. IIHF president René Fasel has protested against fighting, deeming it &quot;Neanderthal behavior&quot;. Wayne Gretzky, considered by many to be the greatest hockey player of all time, has often spoken out against fighting.

NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, at a 2007 press conference broadcast on CBC Sports, said, &quot;Fighting has always had a role in the game ... from a player safety standpoint, what happens in fighting is something we need to look at just as we need to look at hits to the head. But we&#x27;re not looking to have a debate on whether fighting is good or bad or should be part of the game.&quot;

Community members often become involved in the debate over banning fighting. In December 2006, a school board trustee in London, Ontario, attended a London Knights game and was shocked by the fighting and by the crowd&#x27;s positive reaction to it. This experience led him to organize an ongoing effort to ban fighting in the Ontario Hockey League, where the Knights compete, by attempting to gain the support of other school boards and by writing letters to OHL administrators. On the advice of its Medical Health Officer, the Middlesex-London Health board has supported recommendations to ban fighting across amateur hockey and to increase disciplinary measures to ensure deterrence.

The first known death directly related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the Whitby Dunlops, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario&#x27;s Major League Hockey, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson&#x27;s helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, he hit his head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players&#x27; use of helmets.

Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard have been posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease of the brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown whether Boogaard&#x27;s death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.

===Rules in-game to discourage fighting===

Since the 1970s, three rules have curtailed the number and scope of fights in the NHL. In 1971, the league created the &quot;Third Man In&quot; rule which attempts to eliminate the bench-clearing brawl by providing for the ejection of the first player who joins a fight already in progress, unless a match penalty is being assessed to a player already engaged in that fight. Another rule automatically suspends the first player from each team that leaves the bench to join a fight when it is not their shift. In 1992, the &quot;Instigator&quot; rule, which adds an additional two-minute minor penalty to the player who starts a fight, was introduced.

Beginning in the 2016–17 season, the American Hockey League imposed a fighting major counter, similar to the National Basketball Association&#x27;s unsportsmanlike technical foul counter and soccer&#x27;s accumulated cards. A player who collects ten major penalties for fighting during the season will be suspended one game, and will be suspended one game for each fighting major for the next three penalties (the 11th, 12th, and 13th fighting majors). A player is suspended two games for his 14th and subsequent major penalty for fighting. If one player involved in the fight is charged with an instigator penalty, the opponent will not have the fighting major count towards suspension. The ECHL added the rule in 2019–20.

Beginning in the 2023-24 season, the ECHL reduced the number of fighting majors that can result in an ejection from three to two, with exceptions for opponents being docked as instigators, and added automatic game misconduct penalties for fights that occur just before or after the puck is dropped.

==Etiquette==

There are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.

Enforcers typically only fight each other, with only the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight. There is a high degree of respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory. This is also known as granting a &quot;free pass&quot;. Enforcer Darren McCarty described fighters as being divided into &quot;heavyweights&quot; and &quot;light heavyweights&quot;, and said that players in the latter category &quot;end up dancing with some guys who could end (their) career with a single punch.&quot;

Long-standing rivalries result in numerous rematches, especially if one of the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is one of the reasons that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.

Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks, and not assaulting referees or linesmen. Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans.

Sportsmanship is also an important aspect when it comes to fights. While an enforcer may start a fight in response to foul play, it is generally not acceptable to start a fight to retaliate against an opponent who scored fairly.

==Tactics==

Fighting tactics are governed by several actual rules, and enforcers will also adopt informal tactics particular to their style and personality. One tactic adopted by players is known as &quot;going for it&quot;, in which the player puts his head down and just throws as many punches as he can, as fast as he can. In the process, that player takes as many punches as he delivers, although some of them are to the hard forehead. Fighters usually must keep one hand on their opponent&#x27;s jersey since the ice surface makes maintaining balance very difficult. For this reason, the majority of a hockey fight consists of the players holding on with one hand and punching with the other.

Other examples include Gordie Howe&#x27;s tactic of holding the sweater of his opponent right around the armpit of his preferred punching arm so as to impede his movement. Probert, of the Detroit Red Wings and Chicago Blackhawks, was known to allow his opponents to punch until they showed signs of tiring, at which time he would take over and usually dominate the fight. Some consider long-time Buffalo Sabres enforcer Rob Ray to be the reason that hockey jerseys are now equipped with tie-down straps (&quot;fight straps&quot;) that prevent their removal; he would always remove his jersey during fights so his opponents would have nothing to grab on to. This is commonly referred to as the &quot;Rob Ray Rule&quot;.

==Officials&#x27; role==

Throughout a game, the referee and linesmen have a role in preventing fights through the way they are managing the game—calling penalties, breaking up scuffles before they escalate, etc. Despite an official&#x27;s best efforts, though, fights do occur and once they do, the referee and linesmen have a certain set of responsibilities to follow in order to safely break up the fight. None of these responsibilities are written in the NHL&#x27;s rule book, but often are guided by &quot;common sense&quot;, according to officials.

In a single fight situation, the linesmen will communicate with each other as to which player they will take during the fight, clear out any sticks, gloves, or other equipment that has been dropped and wait for a safe time to enter the fight, which they will do together. If both players are still standing while the linesmen enter, the linesmen will approach from each side (never from behind), bring their arms over the combatants&#x27; arms and wrap them around, pushing downwards and breaking the players apart. If the players have fallen, the linesmen will approach from the side (never over the skates), getting in between the two players. One linesman will use his body to shield the player on the bottom from the other player while his partner will remove the top player from the fight. Most linesmen will allow a fight to run its course for their own safety, but will enter a fight regardless if one player has gained a significant advantage over his opponent. Once the players have been broken up, the linesmen then escort the players off the ice. During this time the referee will keep other players from entering the fight by sending them to a neutral area on the ice and then watching the fight and assessing any other penalties that occur.

In a multiple-fight situation, the linesmen will normally break up fights together, one fight at a time using the same procedures for a single fight. The linesmen will communicate with each other which fight to break up. In a multiple-fight situation, the referee will stand in an area of the ice where he/she can have a full view of all the players and will write down—on a pad of paper commonly known as a &quot;riot pad&quot;—the numbers of the players that are involved in the fights, watching for situations that warrant additional penalties, such as players removing opponents&#x27; helmets, players participating in a second fight, players leaving a bench to participate in a fight, or third players into a fight. The referee will not normally break up a fight unless the linesmen need assistance, or a fight is occurring where a player has gained a significant advantage over the other player, leading to concerns of significant injury.

<text>The Shipping News is a novel by American author E. Annie Proulx and published by Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in 1993. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the U.S. National Book Award, as well as other awards. It was adapted as a film of the same name which was released in 2001.

==Plot summary==
The story revolves around Quoyle, a newspaper reporter from upstate New York, whose father had emigrated from Newfoundland. Quoyle&#x27;s distant parents have recently committed suicide, and his estranged wife, Petal has died in a car accident with another man. As a result Quoyle decides to relocate his two young girls to their ancestral home in Newfoundland. His paternal aunt, Agnis Hamm, convinces him to make a new beginning and they move into Agnis&#x27;s childhood home, an empty and abandoned house on Quoyle&#x27;s Point. Quoyle finds work as a reporter for the &quot;Gammy Bird&quot;, the local newspaper in Killick-Claw, a small town. The &quot;Gammy Bird&quot;″s editor asks him to cover traffic accidents and also the shipping news, documenting the arrivals and departures of ships from the local port. His reporting develops as Quoyle&#x27;s signature column.

Over time, Quoyle learns deep and disturbing secrets about his ancestors that emerge in strange ways. As Quoyle builds his new life in Newfoundland, he is transformed. He creates a rewarding job, makes friends and begins a relationship with a local woman, Wavey Prowse.

==Ashley&#x27;s influence==
In her acknowledgments, Proulx states, &quot;And without the inspiration of Clifford W. Ashley&#x27;s wonderful 1944 work, &quot;The Ashley Book of Knots&quot;, which I had the good fortune to find at a yard sale for a quarter, this book would have remained just a thread of an idea.&quot; Ashley&#x27;s illustrations and quotes are used as chapter headings throughout the book. Some names in the book are taken from knots, for example &quot;Killick hitch&quot; and coil. Coil also refers to &quot;quoyle,&quot; the protagonist&#x27;s name, a coil of rope only one layer thick, flat, &quot;so that it may be walked on ...&quot; This metaphor sums up Quoyle&#x27;s relationship with the world around him in the novel&#x27;s first half. Proulx also adopts a unique writing style using fragments and detailed descriptions.

<text>Are You Experienced is the debut studio album by the Jimi Hendrix Experience, released in May 1967. The album was an immediate critical and commercial success, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums of all time. It features Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s innovative approach to songwriting and electric guitar playing, which soon established a new direction in psychedelic and rock music as a whole.

After struggling to earn a living on the R&amp;B circuit as a backing guitarist, Hendrix signed a management and production contract in 1966 with former Animals bassist Chas Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and recruited members for the Jimi Hendrix Experience, a band designed to showcase the guitarist&#x27;s talents. In late October, after having been rejected by Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who&#x27;s managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album was completed in 16 recording sessions at three London locations: De Lane Lea Studios, CBS Studios, and Olympic Studios.

Released in the UK on May 12, 1967, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; spent 33 weeks on the British charts, peaking at number two. The album was issued in the US on August 23 by Reprise Records, where it reached number five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, remaining on the chart for 106 weeks, 76 of those in the Top 40. The album also spent 70 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B LPs chart, where it peaked at number 10. The US version contained some of Hendrix&#x27;s best known songs, including the Experience&#x27;s first three singles, which, though omitted from the British edition of the LP, were top ten hits in the UK: &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;. Hendrix was unhappy with the cover artwork for the UK edition, and solicited photographer Karl Ferris to create a more &quot;psychedelic&quot; cover for the US release.

In the decades since its release, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; has continued to receive acclaim. It was voted number 63 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; 30th on its 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2010, the magazine placed four songs from the US version of the album on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;: &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (17), &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; (153), &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (201), and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; (379). In 2005, the album was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: &quot;it&#x27;s still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&amp;B, blues ... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way I compare to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot;

==Background==

By May 1966, Jimi Hendrix was struggling to earn a living playing the R&amp;B circuit as a back-up guitarist. During a performance at one of New York City&#x27;s most popular nightspots, the Cheetah Club, he was noticed by Linda Keith, the girlfriend of Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Shortly after, Hendrix relocated to the city&#x27;s Greenwich Village and began a residency at the Cafe Wha? fronting his own band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames. Keith recommended Hendrix to Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham and producer Seymour Stein. They failed to see Hendrix&#x27;s musical potential, and rejected him. She then referred him to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists. Chandler liked the Billy Roberts song &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, and was convinced he could create a hit single with the right artist. Impressed with Hendrix&#x27;s live version of the song with his band, he brought him to London on September 24, 1966, and signed him to a management and production contract with himself and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery.

Immediately following Hendrix&#x27;s arrival in London, Chandler began recruiting members for a band, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, designed to showcase the guitarist&#x27;s talents. Hendrix met the guitarist Noel Redding at an audition for the New Animals, where Redding&#x27;s knowledge of blues progressions impressed Hendrix. Chandler asked Redding if he wanted to play bass guitar in Hendrix&#x27;s band; Redding agreed. Chandler then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he contacted Mitch Mitchell through a mutual friend. Mitchell, who had recently been fired from Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames, participated in a rehearsal with Redding and Hendrix where they bonded over their shared interest in rhythm and blues. When Chandler phoned Mitchell later that day to offer him the position, he readily accepted. In late October, after having been rejected by Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who&#x27;s managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.
==Recording==
&quot;Are You Experienced&quot; and its preceding singles were recorded over a five-month period from October 23, 1966, to April 4, 1967. The album was completed in 16 recording sessions at three London locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS, and Olympic. Chandler booked many of the sessions at Olympic because the facility was acoustically superior and equipped with most of the latest technology, though it was still using four-track recorders, whereas American studios were using eight-track.

Chandler&#x27;s budget was limited, so in an effort to reduce expenditures he and Hendrix completed much of the album&#x27;s pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren&#x27;t having enough—or any—say ... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I&#x27;d seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not going to let that happen with Jimi.&quot; When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding&#x27;s bass parts.
===October to December 1966===
Chandler and the Experience found time to record between performances in Europe. They began on October 23, recording &quot;Hey Joe&quot; at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: &quot;Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn&#x27;t let him play guitar loud enough ... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, and it was so loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises.&quot; According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: &quot;If I can&#x27;t play as loud as I want, I might as well go back to New York.&quot; Chandler, who had Hendrix&#x27;s immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to &quot;piss off&quot;. Hendrix laughed and said: &quot;All right, you called my bluff&quot;, and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Killing Floor&quot; or Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;. Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, &quot;Stone Free&quot;, the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded &quot;Stone Free&quot; and a demo version of &quot;Can You See Me&quot;. This marked the first time that the Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.

Chandler had been dissatisfied with the sound quality at De Lane Lea, so he took the advice of Kit Lambert and booked time at CBS Studios. On December 13, 1966, after taking a five-week break from recording while they performed in Europe, the Experience reconvened at CBS. Assisted by engineer Mike Ross, the band were especially productive during the session, recording instrumentation and vocals for &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; and basic instrumental tracks for &quot;Love or Confusion&quot;, &quot;Can You See Me&quot;, and &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot;. Ross recalled the impact of Hendrix&#x27;s Marshall stacks: &quot;It was so loud you couldn&#x27;t stand in the studio ... I&#x27;d never heard anything like it in my life.&quot; When Ross asked Hendrix where he would like the microphone placed Hendrix replied: &quot;Oh, man, just put a mic about twelve feet away on the other side of the studio. It&#x27;ll sound great.&quot; Ross agreed, and with a Neumann condenser mic he recorded Hendrix&#x27;s guitar playing in a large room that, according to Ross, &quot;was absolutely vital to the uniquely powerful Experience sound.&quot; Ross noted that input from Mitchell and Redding was minimized, and he asserted that Chandler was clearly &quot;the one in charge&quot; of the sessions. The band played together live at CBS; the lead and backup vocals were overdubbed. Despite his dwindling finances, Chandler encouraged the Experience to record numerous takes of a song, affording them the luxury of repeated attempts at a satisfactory recording. With a live instrument track as the foundation of the recordings, they eschewed the common practice of piecing together parts of several takes to make one continuous piece. After the December 13 recording session, the band made their television debut, on Britain&#x27;s &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;

On December 15, 1966, finishing touches were made on the four rhythm tracks that were recorded the previous session. Although Chandler enjoyed working at CBS and he appreciated the high quality of the recordings they made there, he ended his professional connection with the studio after a disagreement between him and owner Jake Levy over his failure to make payment. Chandler had planned to pay Levy for the sessions after the album was completed, but Levy demanded payment upfront. Chandler viewed this as an unreasonable expectation, and he vowed that he would never again do business with CBS. The fifth and final song recorded there was &quot;Red House&quot;. As stereophonic sound was not yet popular among music fans, these recordings were all monaural mixes; Ross explained: &quot;back then ... mono was &quot;king&quot;. All the effort went into the mono.&quot; He estimated that they spent no more than 30 minutes mixing any one track.

The first Experience single, with &quot;Hey Joe&quot; as the A-side and &quot;Stone Free&quot; as the B-side, was released in the UK on December 16, 1966. Track Records was not yet operational, so their distributor, Polydor Records, issued the single with their logo. It reached number six on the UK chart in early 1967. On December 21, 1966, Chandler and the Experience returned to De Lane Lea with Dave Siddle as engineer. They recorded two alternate versions of &quot;Red House&quot; and began work on &quot;Remember&quot;; both tracks were significantly re-worked in April 1967 at Olympic Studios.

===January to April 1967===

====January====
After a three-week break from recording while they played gigs in England, including a December 29 appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, the Experience reconvened at De Lane Lea on January 11, 1967. As &quot;Hey Joe&quot; was gaining chart momentum in the UK, they began working on their second single, which featured Hendrix&#x27;s second songwriting effort, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, as its A-side. The track presented a more complex arrangement than the band&#x27;s previous recordings, and required four hours of studio time to complete, which Chandler considered extravagant. The session was the first time that he and the group had experimented with guitar effects. Acoustic engineer Roger Mayer introduced Hendrix to the Octavia, an octave-doubling effect pedal, in December 1966, and he first recorded with the effect during the guitar solo of &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. When Track Records sent the master tapes for &quot;Purple Haze&quot; to Reprise for remastering, they wrote on the tape box: &quot;Deliberate distortion. Do not correct.&quot;

At the same January 11 session the Experience worked on the single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;51st Anniversary&quot;, a song that marked their first use of overdubbing in lieu of retakes as a method of achieving a satisfactory track. Chandler explained: &quot;There were five guitar overdubs all linking in together to sound like one guitar.&quot; The song, which Redding and Mitchell had not yet heard before that day, was completed during the session. Chandler had decided that they should discard the rough version of &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; from December 13 and re-record the song; they completed a basic track for the piece, but were unable to achieve a finished master. The group also managed to produce an acceptable live recording of the basic track for &quot;Fire&quot; after seven takes. Next, they attempted Hendrix&#x27;s newly written ballad, &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;. Without the benefit of rehearsals, the band recorded the song in one take, to which Hendrix added several guitar overdubs; Chandler estimated that they spent approximately 20 minutes on the completed rhythm track. According to Chandler, by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input. Chandler explained that financial considerations influenced the creative dynamic: &quot;[They] were sort of fighting the fact that they had no say during recording sessions ... they were starting to come up with suggestions, but ... We didn&#x27;t need to be arguing with Noel for ten minutes and Mitch for five ... We just couldn&#x27;t afford the time.&quot;

Between January 12 and February 2, 1967, the Experience took a break from recording while they played 20 dates in England, including a second appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, on January 18. Chandler was dissatisfied with the sound quality of the January 11 recordings and frustrated by the large number of noise complaints that they had received from people living and working near De Lane Lea. He explained: &quot;There was a bank above the studio ... and it was at the time when computers were just coming in ... we would play so loud that it would foul up the computers upstairs.&quot; Brian Jones and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones encouraged Chandler to try Olympic Studios, which was considered the top independent London studio. Despite the growing chart success of their first single, Chandler&#x27;s financial problems persisted. Olympic required advance payment for studio time, but Polydor had not yet released any funds to Track for disbursement. When Chandler went to Polydor asking for relief they responded by guaranteeing him a line of credit at Olympic.

====February====
With his budget concerns alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, where on February 3, 1967, he and the Experience met sound engineer Eddie Kramer. During Kramer&#x27;s first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method that they had been using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell&#x27;s drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding&#x27;s bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer&#x27;s unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix&#x27;s complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then pre-mixed and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix&#x27;s perfectionism and Chandler&#x27;s desire to reduce the number of takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix&#x27;s guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix&#x27;s amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyerdynamic M 160 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.

During the February 3, 1967, session at Olympic, the Experience improved the January 11 master tape of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; by re-recording the vocal and lead guitar parts, and adding another Octavia guitar overdub, which was sped-up and panned at the end of the song. The group reconvened at Olympic on February 7, continuing their work on &quot;Purple Haze&quot; by recording Hendrix&#x27;s rhythm guitar and vocal parts, as well as Redding&#x27;s background vocals. They spent time overdubbing ambient background sounds by playing tapes through a set of headphones that were held near a microphone, creating an echo effect as the headphones were moved closer; they completed a final mix of &quot;Purple Haze&quot; the following day. During the session, they worked on the De Lane Lea master tape of &quot;Fire&quot;, replacing everything except Redding&#x27;s bass line, which he double-tracked in an effort to accentuate the recording&#x27;s lower frequencies. Kramer placed the second bass line on a dedicated track and blended Redding&#x27;s original bass line with Mitchell&#x27;s newly recorded drum part. They also recorded Mitchell and Redding&#x27;s backing vocals. &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; was also reworked on February 8; Redding recorded a new bass line and Hendrix and Mitchell added overdubs to their existing parts. After recording backing vocals by Redding and lead vocals from Hendrix, Kramer prepared the song&#x27;s final mix.

Hendrix was not as confident a singer as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier between him and the control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix&#x27;s penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: &quot;Sometimes, it got so loud we&#x27;d turn the [control booth] monitors off and there was really very little difference.&quot; Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix&#x27;s music were not always positive: &quot;I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, &#x27;I can&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about myself&#x27;, or &#x27;I don&#x27;t know how you listen to all that noise; I&#x27;d be scared to work with him&#x27; ... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right.&quot; Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: &quot;It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork.&quot;

On February 20, 1967, the Experience continued working on &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, but scheduling conflicts at Olympic led Chandler to book time at De Lane Lea. During the session they recorded &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot;, which featured a manual wah effect that predated the pedal unit. They managed to complete a working master by the end of the day, though Hendrix eventually recorded a new lead vocal at Olympic.

====March and April====
The Experience took a week break from recording while playing gigs in England, and returned to De Lane Lea on March 1, 1967, to attempt a studio recording of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Although the song had long been a staple of the group&#x27;s live show, they failed to achieve an acceptable basic track, owing mostly to Mitchell&#x27;s inability to keep consistent time during the session.

The second Experience single, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;/&quot;51st Anniversary&quot;, was released on March 1. It entered the UK singles chart on the 23rd, peaking at number three. During that month, the band took another long break from recording while they played gigs in Belgium, Germany, and the UK, including appearances on the UK television show &quot;Dee Time&quot; and the BBC Radio show &quot;Saturday Club&quot;. Scheduling conflicts at Olympic led Chandler to book a March 29 session at De Lane Lea. On this date the band worked on another newly written Hendrix composition, &quot;Manic Depression&quot;; they finished a rough mix by the end of the session that was later rejected in favor of a re-mix completed at Olympic. On April 3, the Experience returned to Olympic, adding overdubs and completing final mixes on several unfinished masters. During the eight-hour session, the band recorded three new songs, including &quot;Highway Chile&quot;, &quot;May This Be Love&quot;, and &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;. As the album&#x27;s title track featured backwards rhythm guitar, bass, and drums, replication of the beat caused Mitchell some consternation when attempting the song live. Chandler completed final mixes for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot;, &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot;, and &quot;May This Be Love&quot; before the end of a session that Kramer described as &quot;very organized.&quot;

In an effort to free up space for Hendrix&#x27;s lead vocals, further reduction mixing was completed for &quot;Are You Experienced?&quot; during a session at Olympic on April 4, 1967. With the title track complete, the Experience shifted their focus to the January 11 rough demo of &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot;. Chandler decided that they should discard the original De Lane Lea tape and record a new version of the song. During the session, Kramer prepared a reduction mix of &quot;Highway Chile&quot;, which made two tracks available for Hendrix&#x27;s lead guitar and vocal overdubs. Though stereo and mono mixes were completed for the song, Chandler preferred the mono version, which he paired with &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; for release as the group&#x27;s third UK single. A reduction mix was prepared for &quot;Love or Confusion&quot;, and Hendrix took advantage of the newly vacant tracks by adding lead guitar and vocals. A final mix was completed before the end of the session. On April 5, Chandler participated in a mastering session at Rye Muse Studios for &quot;Highway Chile&quot; and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;, during which preparations were made so that Track could begin manufacturing records. On the 10th, he and the Experience returned to Olympic, spending the bulk of the session on editing dialogue segments for &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot;, which were then slowed down and mixed into the song. Kramer concentrated his efforts on the song&#x27;s complicated mix: &quot;The song was like a watercolor painting ... each track was composed of four, fairly dense composite images.&quot;

After the April 10, 1967, recording session, the Experience spent the next two weeks playing shows and attending promotional appearances in England, including a spot on the BBC television program &quot;Monday Monday&quot; and BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Late Night Line-Up&quot;. Chandler, Hendrix, and Kramer completed the final mixing of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; at Olympic by 3 a.m. on April 25. Chandler had agreed to audition the finished LP for Polydor&#x27;s head of A&amp;R, Horst Schmaltze, at 11 a.m., so after a few hours of sleep he prepared a suitable acetate demo and traveled to Polydor. Chandler recalled: &quot;As Horst started to put the needle on the record, I broke out in a cold sweat, thinking ... when he hears this, he&#x27;s going to order the men in white coats to take me away ... Horst played the first side through and didn&#x27;t say a word. Then he turned the disk over and played the other side. I started thinking about how I was going to talk my way out of this. At the end of the second side, he just sat there. Finally, he said, &#x27;This is brilliant. This is the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. Horst immediately became an ardent supporter of the album and the band, championing the marketing and distribution of their debut LP.

==Music and lyrics==
According to Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro, the music on &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; incorporates a variety of music genres from rhythm and blues to free jazz; author Peter Doggett noted its &quot;wide variety of styles&quot;, while journalist Chris Welch said &quot;each track has a different personality&quot;. Musicologist Gilbert Chase asserted that the album &quot;marked a high peak in hard rock&quot;, and music critic Jim DeRogatis characterized the LP and its preceding singles as &quot;raw, focused psychedelic rock,&quot; which he compared to the music on the compilation album . A contemporary review published in &quot;Newsweek&quot; in October 1967 identified the influence of soul music on the Experience and the album. In 1989, &quot;Hit Parader&quot; magazine ranked it number 35 in a list of the top 100 heavy metal albums. In 2006, writer and archivist Reuben Jackson of the Smithsonian Institution wrote: &quot;it&#x27;s still a landmark recording because it is of the rock, R&amp;B, blues ... musical tradition. It altered the syntax of the music ... in a way I compare to, say, James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.&quot;

Included on the UK edition of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; were two tracks that represented the music Hendrix had played in the US before the formation of the Experience: the blues track &quot;Red House&quot; and the rhythm and blues song &quot;Remember&quot;. The album&#x27;s psychedelic title track, which author Sean Egan described as impressionistic, featured the post-modern soundscapes of backwards guitar and drums that pre-date scratching by 10 years. Musicologist Ritchie Unterberger considers the lyrics to &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot; to be more at home in a gothic rock setting than in psychedelia, however; he describes the music as being &quot;played and sung with an ebullience that belies the darkness of the lyrics.&quot; The song&#x27;s tribal rhythms served as a platform for Hendrix&#x27;s innovative guitar feedback improvisations. Whereas &quot;Fire&quot; is a funk and soul hybrid driven by Mitchell&#x27;s drumming, &quot;May This Be Love&quot; and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; are soft ballads that demonstrate Hendrix&#x27;s ability to write thoughtful lyrics and subtle melodies. The influence of raga rock can be heard in his sitar-like guitar solo on &quot;Love or Confusion&quot;. &quot;Can You See Me&quot; is an uptempo rocker that features Hendrix&#x27;s double tracked vocals and his use of a one-note bend in the style of Hank Marvin. Although &quot;Hey Joe&quot; is a folk song, and the only cover on the album, it would become one of Hendrix&#x27;s most requested tracks.

The UK edition of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; opened with &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, a track that, with the exception of a few overdubs, was recorded in one session at CBS. Hendrix wrote the song about Heather Taylor, a London socialite who later married the Who&#x27;s Roger Daltrey. It begins with the fade-in of an F note that Hendrix is bending-up to F sharp while applying generous finger vibrato. Using his guitar&#x27;s control knob, he slowly increases volume until an audio feedback loop develops and he slides into the song&#x27;s implied dominant seventh sharp ninth chord. Hendrix used a combination of natural amplifier overdrive and fuzz box effects units to create the song&#x27;s razor-sharp guitar tone. Its blues–inspired solo—his fourth since arriving in England—used pentatonic scales while showcasing his innovative approach to melody; by exploiting the increased sustain created by overdriving his amplifiers, he moved seamlessly between the middle and high registers with a fluid, singing tone. Author Peter Doggett compared its slow beat to Memphis soul; David Stubbs described the track as a prototype for heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath.

Although the lyrics to &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, which opened the US edition of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, are often misinterpreted as describing an acid trip, Hendrix explained: &quot;[It] was all about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.&quot; He speculated that the dream may have been inspired by a science fiction story about a purple death ray. Redding stated that Hendrix had not yet taken LSD at the time of the song&#x27;s writing, which was after a gig in London on December 26, 1966. The first draft of the lyrics was exceedingly long, so Chandler and Hendrix reduced its length to something appropriate for mainstream pop music. It opens with a guitar/bass harmony in the interval of a tritone that was known as the &quot;diabolus in musica&quot; during the time of the Spanish Inquisition. The Catholic Church prohibited medieval composers of religious music from using the tritone, or flattened fifth, because as musicologist Dave Whitehill wrote: &quot;to play it was like ringing Satan&#x27;s doorbell.&quot; In the opinion of the author Ritchie Unterberger, the opening riff has &quot;become a permanent part of rock&#x27;s vocabulary.&quot; Whereas &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the song as the beginning of late-1960s psychedelia, the authors Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek identified Hendrix&#x27;s use of R&amp;B, funk, and soul elements in the track.

In 1967, Hendrix told the journalist Keith Altham that &quot;Third Stone from the Sun&quot; is about a visiting space alien who, upon evaluation of the human species, decides that people are not fit to rule Earth, destroys their civilization, and places the planet in the care of chickens. The song is composed of two contrasting sections, one that features a jazzy guitar melody played in the style of Wes Montgomery over a straightforward rock tempo, and another that showcases Hendrix&#x27;s free-form mixolydian mode guitar lines with a jazz beat. The track contains no proper vocals, instead using spoken words played at half-speed to invoke images of interstellar space travel. In addition to jazz elements, Unterberger identified Hendrix&#x27;s use of surf music motifs in the track that are reminiscent of earlier works by the Ventures, a group from the Pacific Northwest that Hendrix would have heard during his childhood.

Hendrix described &quot;Manic Depression&quot; as &quot;ugly times music&quot;; during a live performance he explained the meaning of the lyrics: &quot;It&#x27;s a story about a cat wishing he could make love to music instead of the same old everyday woman.&quot; The song is unusual in that it&#x27;s written in triple meter, or time, which is the time signature commonly associated with a waltz; most rock music is written in . Although his delivery is rock oriented, Mitchell&#x27;s drumming on the track is reminiscent of Elvin Jones&#x27;s fluid jazz patterns. Musicologist Andy Aledort noted Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;dramatic use of chromaticism&quot; during the song&#x27;s opening bars and the &quot;heavily vibratoed unison bends&quot; that presage what he described as one of Hendrix&#x27;s best guitar solos.

&quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; is the first ballad recorded by the Experience; Hendrix wrote the lyrics after an argument with his girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, whose middle name is Mary. She explained: &quot;I smashed plates on the floor, [and] he swept them up. He locked me in the bathroom for absolutely ages and ... eventually Chas&#x27;s girlfriend Lotta let me out ... I ran out to get a taxi and was standing under the traffic lights, and I had red hair and a red dress. I went back after I&#x27;d cooled down and he&#x27;d already written it.&quot; The song featured a chord progression inspired by Curtis Mayfield and lyrics that reflected Hendrix&#x27;s admiration of Bob Dylan. &quot;Stone Free&quot; expressed Hendrix&#x27;s desire to preserve his personal freedom, demurring the concepts of conformity and long-term relationships. He revisited this theme in &quot;51st Anniversary&quot; and &quot;Highway Chile&quot;. Omitted from the American version of the album, &quot;Red House&quot; did not see an official release in the US until the 1969 compilation &quot;Smash Hits&quot;. An unusual feature of the recording is that it does not include a bass guitar track; Redding instead played rhythm guitar with his equalization set strongly in favor of bass tones. It is Hendrix&#x27;s only original twelve-bar blues.

==Album cover==
Chris Stamp designed the cover of the UK version of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, which featured a picture of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by Bruce Fleming. The image shows Hendrix wearing a long dark cape while standing over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan described as a &quot;Dracula-esque pose&quot;. Chandler contacted Fleming based on the photographer&#x27;s previous work with the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals. The photo shoot took place in February after Fleming had attended several recording sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler made a point of requesting that the band member&#x27;s faces be clearly visible in the photograph; Fleming explained: &quot;[Album covers] got much more esoteric as time went on, but to establish the artist we had to get their faces across so the kids would recognize them.&quot; He took monochrome and color shots of the band; Track selected an image from the latter group. Fleming had indicated which picture he preferred they use, marking the shot with a cross, but after the album&#x27;s release he realized that they had selected another, less desirable image. According to Fleming, the shot that he chose was &quot;more sinister; more interesting&quot;. Stamp hired graphic artist Alan Aldridge to design the sleeve&#x27;s psychedelic lettering. Track inexplicably put only the album&#x27;s title on the cover, omitting the band&#x27;s name; Polydor issued the release throughout Europe with Hendrix&#x27;s name printed at the top in matching font. The cover art&#x27;s combination of dull green and brown tones, juxtaposed with the jocular nature of the subject&#x27;s pose, created a weak overall visual impression; Stamp commented: &quot;It&#x27;s not a great cover at all. Hopefully, we made up for that in all the other covers.&quot;

Hendrix disliked the UK cover of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, so arrangements were made for a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted &quot;something psychedelic&quot;, so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer&#x27;s sleeve-work on the Hollies&#x27; June 1967 release &quot;Evolution&quot;. During a meeting with the band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to hear more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, &quot;&quot;. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was &quot;so far out that it seemed to come from outer space&quot;, which inspired him to develop a backstory about a &quot;group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth.&quot; With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as &quot;an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature&quot;, further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band&#x27;s wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix&#x27;s girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix&#x27;s new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King&#x27;s Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix&#x27;s hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover&#x27;s yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.

==Release==

===Europe===
The third Experience single, &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; backed by &quot;Highway Chile&quot;, was released in the UK on May 5, 1967, while &quot;Purple Haze&quot; occupied the number three spot in the charts. The management&#x27;s decision to release the single while the previous one was still present in the UK charts was unorthodox, as was the choice of &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;, which differed greatly from &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. Stamp recalled: &quot;We did that on purpose ... We wanted musically to show who this person was.&quot; Egan wrote: &quot;It alerted the public to the fact that the so-called Wild Man of Borneo was capable of songs of delicacy and sensitivity.&quot; &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; reached number six in the UK in May.

Track Records released &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; in the UK on May 12, 1967. It entered the charts on May 27, where it spent 33 weeks, peaking at number two. It remained in the charts long enough that it was still present when the Experience released their second album, &quot;&quot;. The album, which was released in the UK without the first three singles, was prevented from reaching the top spot by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

In France and the Benelux countries, Hendrix&#x27;s recordings were released by Barclay Records in a distribution deal secured by Jeffery.

===North America===
Although popular in Europe at the time, the Experience&#x27;s first US single, &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, failed to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart upon its release on May 1, 1967. The group&#x27;s fortunes improved when Paul McCartney recommended them to the organizers of the Monterey Pop Festival. He insisted that the event would be incomplete without Hendrix, whom he called &quot;an absolute ace on the guitar&quot;, and he agreed to join the board of organizers on the condition that the Experience perform at the festival in mid-June. During the climax of the festival, which was filmed by D. A. Pennebaker for the documentary &quot;Monterey Pop&quot;, Hendrix burned and smashed his guitar on stage for dramatic effect.

After the show-stealing performance, Reprise Records agreed to distribute &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;. However, despite the increased awareness that the Experience&#x27;s performance at Monterey provided, the second Experience single, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; / &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;, released in the US on August 16, 1967, stalled at number 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Although the single performed poorly in the US charts, its presence on underground FM radio stations, which were transitioning from easy listening and classical music formats to album cuts, significantly aided sales of the LP. Reprise allocated a $20,000 promotional budget for the LP, which was an unprecedented amount for an unproven artist. Released in the US on August 23 by Reprise, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. The album remained on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart for 106 weeks, 76 of those in the Top 40. The North American edition of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; featured a new cover by Karl Ferris and a new track list, with Reprise omitting &quot;Red House&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot;, and &quot;Can You See Me&quot;, and including the first three A-sides omitted from the UK release: &quot;Hey Joe&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot;, and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Are You Experienced&quot; was an immediate commercial success, selling more than one million copies within seven months of its release. Reviewing the album in 1967, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised its artistic integrity and the Experience&#x27;s varied use of tempo. &quot;NME&quot; Keith Altham said it is &quot;a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting&quot;. However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a &quot;great guitarist and a brilliant arranger&quot;, he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: &quot;Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.&quot;

Many music critics have since named &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; as one of the greatest debut albums in rock music and of all time. According to Associated Press writer Hillel Italie, it was among the notable debuts in a year that marked rock music&#x27;s transition into the album era. Journalist Ritchie Unterberger described it as &quot;one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era&quot;, while author Chris Smith said the release was &quot;a landmark in a summer of landmark albums&quot;. Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, called it &quot;a veritable textbook of what a musician can do with his instrument&quot; and &quot;the measure by which everything ... in rock and roll has been compared since.&quot; According to music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, the album &quot;completely changed notions of what a guitar could sound like, or indeed, what music could sound like&quot;, while the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; credited &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; with introducing acid rock, classic rock, and the guitar aesthetic of heavy metal. Critic Robert Christgau called it a &quot;bombshell debut&quot; in his review for &quot;Blender&quot; and said its songs were innovative for how they utilized three-minute pop structures as a medium for Hendrix&#x27;s unprecedentedly heavy and turbulent guitar and loud, powerful hooks, which greatly appealed to young listeners.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; includes the album and several songs on various &quot;best of&quot; lists, such as:
* 500 Greatest Albums of All Time – No. 30, calling it an &quot;epochal debut&quot;, and praising Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;exploitation of amp howl&quot;, and characterizing his guitar playing as &quot;incendiary ... historic in itself&quot;. (2020)
* 500 Greatest Songs of All Time – &quot;Purple Haze&quot; (No. 17), &quot;Foxy Lady&quot; (No. 153), &quot;Hey Joe&quot; (No. 201), and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; (No. 379). (2011)
* Best Debut Albums of All Time – No. 3, crediting it as the LP &quot;that established the transcendent promise of psychedelia&quot;, stating: &quot;Every idea we have of the guitarist as groundbreaking individual artist comes from this record.&quot; (2013)
Additionally, &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine listed &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; as the greatest guitar album of all time in 2013. In 2005, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry, which annually selects recordings that are &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The album was also included in &quot;A Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings—published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981)—and in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Track listing==
Since the first release of &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; in 1967, there have been six different track listings. Since 1997, compact disc editions in the US and UK feature 17 tracks, including all songs that appeared on either the original UK/international edition of the album or the original North American edition, as well as the Experience&#x27;s first three singles (&quot;Hey Joe&quot; b/w &quot;Stone Free&quot;, &quot;Purple Haze&quot; b/w &quot;51st Anniversary&quot;, and &quot;The Wind Cries Mary&quot; b/w &quot;Highway Chile&quot;).

===Original UK and international edition===
The original UK Track album did not list running times for the songs. Instead, they are taken from the original international Polydor edition. All tracks written by Jimi Hendrix.

===Original North American edition===
The listings are taken from the original US Reprise album. All tracks written by Jimi Hendrix, except where noted.


===CD releases===
&quot;Are You Experienced&quot; was first issued on the Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD format in 1985 by Polydor Records (Track&#x27;s successor) in Europe and Reprise in the US. These early CDs essentially copied the original LP record albums and used the same tracks, sequencing, and cover art as their 1967 counterparts. Both were reissued with minor changes in 1989–1991 and the Reprise release CD sleeve included &quot;Digital re-mastering by Joe Gastwirt, assisted by Dave Mitson using the Sonic Solutions NoNoise System, under the supervision of Are You Experienced? Ltd.&quot;

In 1993, Alan Douglas, who managed Hendrix&#x27;s recording catalogue, reached an agreement with MCA Records for the future releases of Hendrix material. He also announced plans for new reissues of the three Experience albums: &quot;Everything in the present catalogue is a budget release... They&#x27;re all 25-year-old packages. I want to take it high-level... with all these new elements&quot;. Along with new artwork and liner notes, the MCA reissue was remastered with only one track selection and order for both the European and America markets. The 17-track CD included the first three Experience British singles (both A-sides and B-sides), followed by the 11 songs as they appeared on the Track/Polydor UK album release.

The 1993 Douglas reissues were short-lived; in 1997, his tenure as the overseer of Hendrix&#x27;s catalogue was taken over by Experience Hendrix (the Hendrix family-controlled company). By April 1997, a new reissue was released, which restored the original artwork and sequencing for both the US and UK releases. However, both reissues included an additional six tracks, which provided the same 17 tracks (all the original singles and album tracks) in the UK and US, although in a different order. Since 1997, these have been the official authorized CD versions of the original albums. In 2010, Sony&#x27;s Legacy Recordings became the exclusive distributor for the recordings managed by Experience Hendrix.

<text>Wheels of Zeus (or WoZ) was a company founded in 2002 by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. WoZ made wireless hardware for keeping track of the physical location of enabled objects. 

In 2004, Motorola announced that it has licensed Wheel of Zeus&#x27; WOZ Platform &quot;to develop new networked consumer-electronics devices&quot;.

The licensable technology consisted of three components:

# Smart Tag A tag containing GPS that could be attached to various objects, such as a briefcase or pet. &quot;Acceptable areas&quot; could be preprogrammed, such that the tag would signal the Tag Detector when it was moved outside them. The tag communicated over a wireless network named &quot;wOzNet&quot; and used GPS techniques to transmit the tag&#x27;s position over extreme distances with very little power.
# Tag Detector This was a handheld device that could monitor a collection of Smart Tags, and provide a distance and direction to help locate them when they were lost. It also communicated with the wOz Service when a Smart Tag was lost.
# WoZ Service An internet-based service that could provide the locations of the various Smart Tags, as well as send an email or SMS notification when a Smart Tag moved outside of its &quot;acceptable area&quot;.

In March 2006, Wheels of Zeus shut down operations.
Some assets and patents were acquired by ZonTrak.

<doc id="568070" wikidata="Q5049166" url="?curid=568070" title="Cass Lake (Minnesota)">
<text>Cass Lake is a lake in north central Minnesota in the United States. It is approximately long and wide, located in Cass and Beltrami counties, within the Chippewa National Forest and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation, adjacent to its namesake city of Cass Lake. It is the 11th largest lake in Minnesota, and the 8th largest lake lying entirely within the borders of the state.

==Name==
In the Ojibwe language, the lake is called &quot;Gaa-miskwaawaakokaag&quot; (where there are many red cedars), and was known to early explorers and traders in French as &quot;Lac du Cedre Rouge&quot;, and English as &quot;Upper Red Cedar Lake&quot;.

==Geography==
The lake occupies a basin that formed over a ground moraine on the lake&#x27;s west side and glacial outwash on its east side from melting glacial ice of the Wadena and Des Moines Lobes, respectively, during the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet after the Last Glacial Maximum. The Mississippi River flows through the lake from west to east. A second major stream, the Turtle River, enters the lake from the north. The lake has a large littoral area, particularly around Cedar Island.

Historically, Cass Lake was considered to be much larger. Pike Bay is a lake lying to the south of Cass Lake; the two lakes are connected by a narrow long channel. Formerly, the two lakes were connected by a wide shallow narrows. Beginning in 1898, construction of a railroad, and later highway and pipeline, across the narrows led to decreased currents through and increased sedimentation in the narrows. The two bodies of water are now generally considered separate lakes, although Pike Bay retains its old name.

The lake contains five islands, including Star Island, Cedar Island, the two Potato Islands, and a small unnamed island. Star Island is notable in that it contains the -sized Lake Windigo, thus forming &quot;a lake within an island within a lake&quot;. .

The Mississippi River leaves Cass Lake in the northeastern corner, flowing next into Lake Winnibigoshish. 
Lake level was maintained and stabilized by Knutson Dam beginning in 1924. Knutson Dam was built to replace earlier brush and log dams built by lumber companies. In 2015, Knutson Dam was removed and replaced with a rock weir. This allows a natural setting for water flowing downstream from Cass Lake, accommodates higher flow rates and allows fish migration between lakes connected by the Mississippi.

==History==
The first recorded visits to the lake by Canadian fur traders were in the 1790s. Mapmaker David Thompson passed through the lake in the spring of 1798 while in the employ of the North West Company. He made the first designation of the location of the headwaters of the Mississippi River, naming Turtle Lake, located upstream of Cass Lake, as the source. This was a matter of great geopolitical importance, as the location of the headwaters was key to mapping the boundary between Canada (British North America) and the United States agreed to in the Treaty of Paris. Thompson&#x27;s visit was followed by that of Zebulon Pike in February 1806 as a part of a military expedition to explore the northern boundary of the Louisiana Purchase. Pike designated Cass Lake as the &#x27;upper source&#x27; and nearby Leech Lake as the &#x27;lower source&#x27; of the river.

In July 1820, an expedition led by General Lewis Cass visited the lake. They were prevented from traveling further upstream by low water, and so designated the lake as the headwaters of the Mississippi because below this point, the river is navigable throughout the ice-free season. In June 1832, Henry Schoolcraft, who had been a member of the 1820 expedition, designated the source of the river as being further upstream at Lake Itasca, the source of the perennial stream. Subsequent to the Cass Expedition of 1820, the lake was renamed Cass Lake in order to distinguish it from Red Cedar Lake (known today as Cedar Lake) in Aitkin County.

Formerly, the lake played an important role in the lumber industry. Log booms were towed across the lake by steamboat from surrounding lakes and streams to either be sawed into lumber at local mills or transported elsewhere by railroad.

==Recreation==
The lake is popular destination for recreational fishing, boating, and swimming. The lake is known for its walleye, northern pike, muskellunge, and yellow perch fisheries. Tullibee are important forage fish. There are numerous campgrounds and resorts located on its shores. The southern and eastern shores of the lake, as well as all the islands, are protected within the Ten Section Area of the Chippewa National Forest. Norway Beach recreation area is located at the southeast corner of the lake and contains Norway Beach Lodge, a notable example of Civilian Conservation Corps-built Finnish-style log architecture. The city of Cass Lake sits near the southwestern side of the lake.

On the isthmus between Cass Lake and neighboring Buck Lake lies Camp Chippewa, a boys camp founded in 1935 by Otto John Endres. Camp Chippewa is a non-profit, private camp for boys between the ages of 8 and 17. Camp Chippewa is renowned for its tripping program. The camp outfits multi week wilderness canoe trips in Minnesota, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The trips vary in length from overnight trips for the youngest campers, to 21 days for the oldest. The in-camp program allows campers to choose their own activities, including archery, riflery, swimming, sailing, canoeing, tennis, fencing, climbing, kayaking, water skiing and soccer. In the Summer of 2019 Camp Chippewa had finally purchased a plot of land on Star Island. Camp Chippewa is directed by Michael and Mary Endres. Another camp, UniStar, lies on a portion of Star Island.

<text>Rock n Roll is the fourth studio album by Ryan Adams, released on November 4, 2003. The album features the hit single &quot;So Alive&quot;, and includes guest appearances by Adams&#x27;s then-girlfriend, actress Parker Posey, former Hole and Smashing Pumpkins bass player Melissa Auf der Maur, and Green Day&#x27;s Billie Joe Armstrong. Adams describes the album as &quot;the most rock thing I have ever done,&quot; and notes that in spite of the album&#x27;s mixed reception, recording it was &quot;fun as fuck.&quot;

The album was recorded in two weeks, in response to Lost Highway&#x27;s refusal to release &quot;Love Is Hell&quot;. The ensuing standoff was resolved &quot;by being very diplomatic,&quot; according to Adams. &quot;Rock n Roll&quot; became the primary product, while &quot;Love Is Hell&quot; was released quietly as two separate EPs, and eventually combined into a single release.

The album was recorded at Stratosphere Sound, guitarist James Iha&#x27;s studio in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York.

==Reception==

The album so far has a score of 66 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it a score of four stars out of five and said, &quot;The &quot;Love Is Hell&quot; discs are far more dense and dark, making the songs a fun challenge to crack open, though it isn&#x27;t difficult to determine what a no-brainer it must have been for Lost Highway to favor the brilliant &quot;Roll&quot; over the more spotty &quot;Hell&quot; discs.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave it a score of seven out of ten and said, &quot;Everywhere the guitars are cranked, the sneakers set on stun.&quot; &quot;Alternative Press&quot; gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, &quot;The jarring stylistic shifts sometimes make listening to RNR feel more like scanning the radio dial than listening to a CD.&quot; In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention () while picking out two songs from the album (&quot;Note to Self: Don&#x27;t Die&quot; and &quot;This Is It&quot;), and quipped about Adams: &quot;Sound effects, emotional affects, he&#x27;s got &#x27;em all.&quot;

Some reviews are average, mixed or negative: Yahoo! Music UK gave it a score of six stars out of ten and said, &quot;Adams can undoubtedly pen this classic rawk stuff with his ears closed and, as a result, the 15 tracks here lack heart.&quot; &quot;No Ripcord&quot; also gave it a score of six stars out of ten and said, &quot;No matter how clichéd and predictable this record gets, there are always some undeniable hooks to lure you back in before your patience wears thin.&quot; Playlouder gave it a score of three stars out of five and said, &quot;There are tunes galore, and ideas that some groups would do someone in for, it’s just a shame he decided to do an approximation of all his favourite bands, and didn’t try something a bit more progressive than &#x27;Rock‘n’Roll&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it a mixed review and said that &quot;Adams devotes himself almost entirely to his rock impulses. The problem is that his writing and vocals aren&#x27;t as consistently distinctive or convincing in the rock arena. He aims for the intensity of Kurt Cobain and Paul Westerberg on some tracks and croons like Jon Bon Jovi on another. It&#x27;s not until the melancholy &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; that Adams slows the tempo and delivers the intimacy that characterized his earlier solo work, most of which was four-star quality.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave it a score of two stars out of five and said that &quot;Adams is too busy winking, smirking and showing off to convey anything approaching an emotion.&quot; Drowned in Sound gave the album a score of three out of ten and called it &quot;the worst record Ryan Adams has ever put his name to; a mess of identikit garage buffoonery and amateurish production, filled with rushed lyrics and written-in-a-weekend tunes.&quot;

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Georgia on 28 March 2004. They followed the partial annulment of the November 2003 parliamentary elections, which were widely believed to have been rigged by the former President Eduard Shevardnadze. New elections for the 150 seats elected by proportional representation were ordered following the resignation of Shevardnadze and the election of new president Mikhail Saakashvili in January 2004. The results of the 75 seats elected in single-member constituencies in 2003 were not annulled.

The elections were won by the National Movement–Democrats, which won 135 of the 150 proportional seats, giving it control of 153 of the 235 seats.

==Conduct==
A preliminary report by observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) praised the conduct of the elections.

&quot;The 28 March 2004 repeat parliamentary election in Georgia demonstrated commendable progress in relation to previous elections. The Georgian authorities have seized the opportunity, since the 4 January presidential election, to further bring Georgia&#x27;s election process in closer alignment with European standards for democratic elections, including OSCE commitments and Council of Europe standards,&quot; the report said.

&quot;However, in the wake of the events of November 2003, the political life of Georgia, as reflected in the election process, is not yet fully normalized. The consolidation of the democratic election process will only be fully tested in a more competitive environment, once a genuine level of political pluralism is re-established.&quot;

In an attempt to produce an election result acceptable to both domestic and international opinion, the Georgian government allowed the votes to be counted simultaneously by the CEC and by a non-government organisation, the International Society for Fair Elections and Society (ISFED). This was called the parallel vote tabulation (PVT). Figures released by ISFED on 31 March showed results almost identical to those released by the CEC.

<doc id="568085" wikidata="Q667070" url="?curid=568085" title="Alecko Eskandarian">
<text>Alecko Eskandarian (, ) (born July 9, 1982) is an American retired soccer player. He is the son of Andranik Eskandrian, a former player of the Iranian national team and the Esteghlal team. He is a former assistant coach for New York Cosmos and head coach for their reserve team, New York Cosmos B.

==Career==
===High School and College===
While at Bergen Catholic High School, Eskandarian won the 1999-00 Gatorade National High School Athlete of the Year Award. He was also named a NSCAA/Adidas All-American and New Jersey State Player of the Year after leading the state of New Jersey in scoring with 66 goals and 15 assists through 25 games during his senior year. He finished his high school career with 154 career goals, the most in Bergen County history and the third most in New Jersey high school history.

Prior to playing as a professional, he played three years of soccer for the University of Virginia where he was named the best player in college soccer and awarded the Hermann Trophy in 2002 after scoring 25 goals (a school record) and 4 assists for the Cavaliers. He played three standout seasons at the University of Virginia and established himself as one of the all-time greats at the school. He finished his Cavaliers career with 50 goals (including 15 game winners), 113 points, and 13 assists in 60 games, before foregoing his senior year to go pro. During his 3 seasons at UVA, Eskandarian was a 3-time All-American, 1st Team All-ACC, ACC Rookie of the Year in 2000, and was also named ACC Player of the Year and Soccer America&#x27;s College Player of the Year in 2002. Eskandarian returned to the university during the 2010 season to finish his degree and take an assistant coaching job with the team.

===Professional===
Eskandarian played his first four MLS seasons for D.C. United, who drafted him #1 overall in the 2003 MLS Superdraft. During his first season he recorded three goals and two assists in 23 games. In the 2004 season, after the replacement of coach Ray Hudson with Peter Nowak, Eskandarian saw significantly more playing time. In his sophomore campaign, Eskandarian led D.C. United in goal scoring with ten in the regular season and added two assists, while scoring 4 more goals in the playoffs as DC United won the 2004 MLS Cup. His strong play also earned him the D.C. United Coaches Award for 2004 and his first spot on the MLS All-Star team.

On November 14, 2004, Eskandarian played in his first MLS Cup game. He helped D.C. United defeat the Kansas City Wizards and win the championship by scoring two goals in the first half just four minutes apart — the fastest pair of goals in MLS Cup history — and was named the MLS Cup MVP. In 2005, Alecko&#x27;s season ended early after suffering a concussion. After missing most of 2005 with post-concussion syndrome, Eskandarian wasted no time in making his mark on the 2006 season, scoring against New York in the season opener. In 22 games for D.C. United, Eskandarian recorded seven goals and two assists, including Goal of the Week honors on 5/13 for his tally against KC. His impressive return to form netted Eskandarian a Commissioner&#x27;s Pick as an MLS All-Star, his second nod to the league&#x27;s showcase event. On August 9, 2006, during the 2006 Summer Tour of Real Madrid, he scored DC United&#x27;s only goal in a 1–1 draw with Real Madrid.

On December 22, 2006, Eskandarian was traded from D.C. United to Toronto FC for a partial allocation. On May 22, 2007, Eskandarian was traded from Toronto FC to Real Salt Lake in exchange for forward Jeff Cunningham.
Between Real Salt Lake and Toronto, Eskandarian played 23 games (starting all 23), scoring 2 goals and adding 3 assists, logging 1,913 minutes.

Chivas USA acquired Eskandarian from Real Salt Lake in exchange for salary cap allocation money. This move was announced on January 18, 2008, at the 2008 MLS SuperDraft.
In 2008, after missing much of the first half of the season due to surgery on a torn adductor, Eskandarian came on strong late in the year and finished the season tied for first on the team with five goals and two assists in just 8 starts. In a span between Aug 30 and Oct 4, he scored a goal against each of his three previous teams (RSL, Toronto, and DC).

Eskandarian was traded to city rivals Los Angeles Galaxy on July 1, 2009. Chivas USA received allocation money and a third round pick in the 2010 MLS SuperDraft in return. He scored in his debut for the Galaxy on July 4, 2009. The goal was a game winner as Los Angeles beat New England 1–0. Eskandarian scored again in a 3–1 win at New York on July 16, a goal which was nominated for MLS Goal of the Year. However, the 27-year-old was injured early in the second half of the Galaxy&#x27;s 2–2 draw with AC Milan on July 19 when the ball was inadvertently cleared into his face, causing a concussion and broken nose.

Due to injury, Alecko was not medically cleared and has been sidelined indefinitely since March 2010. He was the assistant coach for the Virginia Cavaliers soccer club. On June 15, 2011, it was announced that Eskandarian had joined Philadelphia Union&#x27;s technical staff as their youth technical director under the direction of the program&#x27;s coach John Hackworth.

===International===
Eskandarian has played one game for the United States national team, against Wales on May 26, 2003.
He has also represented the United States at the U-17, U-20, and U-23 national teams. Eskandarian was leading scorer of the Olympic Qualifying tournament in Mexico in 2004 (4 goals), although the US team failed to qualify for the 2004 Olympics in Athens.

===Coaching===
On February 1, 2013, Eskandarian signed with the New York Cosmos as an assistant coach, joining the same club that he once watched his father, Iran defender Andranik Eskandarian play for when he was a child.

Eskandarian was part of head coach Giovanni Savarese&#x27;s coaching staff during the team&#x27;s historic 2013 relaunch season. During the 2013 season, Eskandarian helped lead the Cosmos to an undefeated record at home (W-D-L: 5–2–0) and the 2013 North American Soccer League Fall Season title with an overall record of 31 points from 14 games (W-D-L: 9–4–1). The Cosmos would cap the season with the NASL Soccer Bowl, where they defeated the Atlanta Silverbacks 1–0 to capture the club&#x27;s sixth title of all time.

Eskandarian led the Cosmos B squad to the National Premier Soccer League title on August 8, 2015, defeating Chattanooga FC, 3–2, in overtime. The game was played in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in front of a crowd of 18,227, the largest crowd ever in the United States to see an amateur soccer match.
Eskandarian finished his 1st season as a head coach with an undefeated record, as Cosmos B posted a 15–0–1 record in the 2015 NPSL season.

===Post-coaching===
After his five-year-long coaching career, Eskandarian began transitioning to front office work at Major League Soccer headquarters in New York City.

==Personal life==

Alecko is of Armenian-Iranian descent and is the son of former Iranian soccer player Andranik Eskandarian, who played soccer professionally for the New York Cosmos, and the Iranian national football team.

Eskandarian also appeared on an episode of &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;. During the episode, fellow Armenian-American Kim Kardashian was set up with him on a blind date.

<text>Elderslie () is a village in the council area and historic county of Renfrewshire in west central Scotland. It chiefly serves as a commuter village, situated midway between the towns of Paisley and Johnstone, and lies west of Glasgow city centre.

Elderslie is most famous as the assumed birthplace of Scottish hero Sir William Wallace, a knight born around 1270 who served as a military leader in the Wars of Scottish Independence before being captured and executed. There is a monument to him in the village, alongside what is believed to be his home.

==History==
The origin of the name of &quot;Elderslie&quot; is Old English for &quot;field of Elder Trees&quot;.

It is assumed that William Wallace was born and grew up in Elderslie. On the site of the ancient Elderslie Castle there stands a monument to commemorate his life, and a commemoration ceremony is held every August. Also on the site is the Wallace Yew, an ancient yew tree and the Wallace Oak stood nearby until 1856. Auchenbathie Tower a few miles to the south is a site associated with William Wallace in an action against the English.

From 1862 until 2004 when the carpet firm merged operations in Kilmarnock only to go into receivership a year later the village was the home to Stoddard Carpets which made the carpets for the Cunard liners , and &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; which were built by John Brown &amp; Company in their shipyard in Clydebank. The firm also produced carpets for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s wedding in Westminster Abbey, the ocean liner and for the Concorde aircraft. A remaining example of the work which was carried out here can be seen in the circular carpet which covers the floor of the drawing room in Culzean Castle designed by Robert Adam.

Elderslie railway station operated on the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway from 1840 to 1966.

==Education==
There is one non-denominational state primary school in Elderslie: Wallace Primary School, which is a feeder school for Castlehead High School, a secondary school in Paisley.

<text>Overtime is a method of determining a winner in an ice hockey game when the score is tied after regulation. The main methods of determining a winner in a tied game are the overtime period (commonly referred to as overtime), the shootout, or a combination of both. If league rules dictate a finite time in which overtime may be played, with no penalty shoot-out to follow, the game&#x27;s winning team may or may not be necessarily determined.

==Overtime periods==

Overtime periods are extra periods beyond the third regulation period during a game, where normal hockey rules apply. Although in the past, full-length overtime periods were played, overtimes today are &quot;golden goal&quot; (a form of &quot;sudden death&quot;), meaning that the game ends immediately when a player scores a goal.

=== North American overtime ===
From November 21, 1942, when overtime (a non-sudden death extra period of 10 minutes duration) was eliminated due to war time restrictions and continuing through the 1982–83 season, all NHL regular-season games tied after 60 minutes of play ended as ties. On June 23, 1983, the NHL introduced a regular-season sudden death overtime period of five minutes. If the five-minute overtime period ended with no scoring, the game ended as a tie. (The World Hockey Association had used a 10-minute, sudden death regular season overtime period during its seven-year existence.) In the first games to go to overtime, on October 5, 1983, the Minnesota North Stars and Los Angeles Kings skated to a 3–3 tie, and the Detroit Red Wings and Winnipeg Jets tied 6–6. The first regular-season game decided by overtime was on October 8, 1983, as the New York Islanders beat the Washington Capitals 8–7.

In 1987–88 and since 1995, the American Hockey League has awarded teams one point in the standings for an overtime loss (OTL). In 1998, the AHL introduced a rule where teams will play the five-minute overtime period with four skaters and a goaltender, rather than at full strength (five skaters), except in two-man advantage situations. In a two-man advantage situation, the team with the advantage will play with five skaters against three skaters. The rule was popular and adopted by the NHL and ECHL the next season.

Alex Ovechkin has the record for most NHL overtime goals with 27.

In the Stanley Cup playoffs and in all tiebreaker games, overtime periods are played like regulation periods – teams are at full strength (five skaters, barring penalties), there is no shootout, and each overtime period is 20 minutes with full intermissions between overtime periods. The game ends when either team scores a goal.

In many leagues (including the NHL for regular-season games since the 2005–06 season) and in international competitions, a failure to reach a decision in a single overtime may lead to a shootout. Some leagues may eschew overtime periods altogether and end games in shootout should teams be tied at the end of regulation. In the ECHL, the AHL, and the Southern Professional Hockey League, regular season overtime periods are played three on three for one five-minute period, with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one additional player on ice (up to two additional players) for each penalty. If the penalised player returns to the ice, the game becomes 4-on-4 or 5-on-5 until the next stoppage of play, when it becomes 3-on-3. Prior to the 2014–15 season, the AHL set the overtime period at seven minutes, but reverted to the now-standard five-minute period the following year. The idea of using 3-on-3 skaters for the entirety of a five-minute overtime period for a regular season game was adopted by the NHL on June 24, 2015, for use in the 2015–16 NHL season. The ECHL has changed the overtime to seven minutes for the 2019–20 season.

=== International overtime ===
In IIHF play, rules for overtime depend on the stage of the competition.

New overtime procedures debuted at the 2019 IIHF World Championship that will be in effect for all IIHF championships, including from the 2022 Winter Olympics hereafter. All overtime periods will be 3-on-3 regardless of round robin or preliminary (five minutes with a three-round shootout), knockout rounds including third place games (ten minutes with a five-round shootout), or the championship (twenty minutes, no shootout). In the championship game only, if that overtime is scoreless, a full intermission will be conducted before the procedure repeats. The overtime ends on whoever scores next. In all cases, teams will change ends.

==Shootout==

===International shootouts===
In international competition, shootouts (or more formally, game-winning shots (GWS), and, in some European countries, bullets, or bullits), are often used. Each coach selects three skaters from their team to take penalty shots one at a time against the opposing goaltender, with teams alternating shots. Each team gets one shot per round. The winner is the team with more goals after three rounds or the team that amasses an unreachable advantage before then (ex. a team gains a two-goal lead with only one round left). If the shootout is tied after three rounds, tie-breaker rounds are played one at a time (with each team taking one additional shot) until there is a winner.

The IIHF first adopted the game-winning-shot procedure in 1992 when a new playoff procedure in the Winter Olympics and World Championships required a winner for each game. At that time, the shootout was five rounds and only used for knock-out games. In 2006, it was reduced to three rounds and used for all games, eliminating the possibility of tied games at IIHF events. Tie-breaker rounds are still used as needed, and the same or new players can take the tie-break shots, which is also done in reverse order. As of May 2016, all IIHF preliminary round games that are not decided by overtime, are decided by a three-round shootout. However, all playoff &amp; bronze medal games of IIHF top level championships (especially the Olympics) are decided by five round shootouts.

Since 2019, the gold-medal game uses multiple 20-minute overtime periods of 3-on-3, and applies to both genders.

===North American shootouts===
Most lower minor leagues (ECHL, Central, UHL) have featured a shootout where, at the end of regulation, a shootout similar to the international tournament format is used.

However, in 2000, the ECHL adopted the AHL&#x27;s four-on-four overtime before the shootout.

For the 2004–05 AHL season, the AHL adopted a five-man shootout, which was first used in that league in 1986–87. The standard five-man shootout is used after four-on-four overtime for all minor leagues in North America. The AHL switched to the NHL formatted three-man shootout for the 2014–15 season.

The Central Collegiate Hockey Association added the shootout as of the 2008–09 season.

Following the lead of minor leagues, in the NHL&#x27;s first post-lockout season of 2005–06, the league ends exhibition and regular season games still tied after a five-minute-length, three-skaters-per-side overtime period (as of the 2015–16 NHL season onwards) with a shootout. The NHL format is a three-round shootout with tiebreaker rounds as needed. All skaters (except goalies) on a team&#x27;s roster must shoot before any player can shoot a second time. On December 16, 2014, the longest shootout in NHL history went to 20 rounds before Nick Bjugstad of the Florida Panthers scored to defeat the Washington Capitals; the previous record was 15 rounds.

The shootout is not used in the playoffs for any major North American league. Instead, full 20-minute overtime periods are played until one team scores a goal.

In the National Hockey League and American Hockey League All-Star Skills Competitions, the competition ends in a penalty shootout known as the &quot;Breakaway Relay&quot;.

===Tactics===

Tactics are very important during penalty shots and overtime shootouts for both the shooter and the goalie. Both shooters and goalies commonly consult their teammates and coaches for advice on the opposing player&#x27;s style of play. Shooters often consider the goalie&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses (such as a fast glove or stick save), preferred goaltending style (such as butterfly or stand-up) and method of challenging the shooter. Goaltenders often consider the shooter&#x27;s shot preference, expected angle of attack, a patented move a shooter commonly uses and even handedness of the shooter.

Most shooters attempt to out-deke the goalie in order to create a better scoring chance. Former Detroit Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk and New York Rangers forward Martin St. Louis are examples of players who commonly use this tactic. However, it is not uncommon for a shooter to simply shoot for an opening without deking. This is commonly referred to as sniping. This is most commonly performed when a goalie challenges a shooter by giving them an open hole (by keeping a glove, pad or stick out of position or being out of sound goaltending position altogether to tempt the shooter to aim for the given opening). Former NHL forwards Markus Näslund and Brett Hull are two players commonly referred to as snipers. Very rarely a shooter may take a slapshot or wrist shot from the point or top of the slot. This is almost exclusively performed when a shooter either has a high level of confidence in their shot or they attempt to catch the goalie by surprise. Retired player Brian Rolston, Detroit Red Wings winger Todd Bertuzzi, Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Chris Pronger, and Vancouver Canucks winger Daniel Sedin have all used this tactic with success.

====Notable NHL playoff overtime games====

* March 24, 1936: The Detroit Red Wings&#x27; Mud Bruneteau ends the longest Stanley Cup playoff game to date, scoring the game&#x27;s only goal in a 1–0 victory over the Montreal Maroons. The goal came at 116:30 of sextuple overtime, for a total of 176:30 of game play. It is also the longest NHL game played, being a mere 3:30 short of the equivalent of playing three games back-to-back-to-back. Normie Smith made an unofficial record 92 saves in that game.
* February 4, 1939: The Boston Bruins&#x27; Mel Hill scores his third overtime goal of the Bruins&#x27; Stanley Cup semi-final series against the New York Rangers, setting an unsurpassed (as of now) NHL record for most overtime goals in a single playoff series, earning him the nickname thereafter of &quot;Sudden Death&quot; Hill. The series itself involves four overtime games, two of which go to triple overtime.
* April 23, 1950: Pete Babando scores at 8:31 of double overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 4–3 win for the title in the seventh game of the 1950 Stanley Cup Finals over the New York Rangers. It is the first time that a seventh game of a Final series goes to overtime.
* April 21, 1951: Bill Barilko scores at 2:53 of overtime to give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3–2 win in the fifth game of the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals over the Montreal Canadiens for a 4–1 title victory. All five games in the series need to have overtime to be decided. Barilko was killed in a private plane crash in a remote part of northern Ontario a few months later.
* April 16, 1954: Tony Leswick&#x27;s shot hit Montreal Canadiens&#x27; defenceman Doug Harvey&#x27;s glove and went into the net at 4:20 of overtime to give the Detroit Red Wings a 2–1 win and the title in the seventh game of the 1954 Stanley Cup Finals over the Canadiens. No seventh game of a Final series has gone to overtime since.
* April 23, 1964: Bobby Baun of the Toronto Maple Leafs nets a game winner against Detroit 1:43 into overtime in game six of the Finals to tie the series 3–all. The goal is notable because Baun broke his ankle earlier in the game. It was frozen and taped, and Baun returned to the ice to score the winning goal.
* May 10, 1970: One of the most indelible moments in sports history is the sight of Bobby Orr&#x27;s &quot;in flight&quot; goal that gave the Boston Bruins a 4–3 win and a four-game sweep of the St. Louis Blues for the title.
* May 24, 1980: Bob Nystrom of the New York Islanders scores the Stanley Cup clinching goal at 7:11 of overtime, beating the Philadelphia Flyers in six games for the title.
* April 14, 1981: After sitting on the bench for the entire game, Mike Crombeen scored the winning goal at 5:16 of double overtime to give the St. Louis Blues a 4–3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins.
* April 10, 1982: &quot;Miracle on Manchester&quot; – Rookie Daryl Evans gives the Los Angeles Kings a 6–5 win over the Edmonton Oilers at 2:35 of overtime. The Kings had trailed the Oilers 5–0 after the second period of game three of the Smythe Division semi-final. This still remains the largest single game playoff comeback in NHL history.
* May 12, 1986: Doug Wickenheiser&#x27;s overtime goal gives the St. Louis Blues a 6–5 win over the Calgary Flames in game six of the Campbell Conference Final. The goal, known as the &quot;Monday Night Miracle&quot;, caps a 5–2 comeback and makes it more impressive that the three goals needed to tie the game were scored in the last ten minutes of the third period.
* May 18, 1986: A Brian Skrudland goal ends the shortest overtime in NHL history at just nine seconds. The winning goal gives the Montreal Canadiens a 3–2 victory over the Calgary Flames in game two of the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals.
* April 18, 1987: &quot;Easter Epic&quot; – Pat LaFontaine of New York Islanders scores a goal against Washington Capitals at 8:47 of quadruple overtime which ends the longest game seven in NHL playoff history. Islanders goaltender Kelly Hrudey makes a record 73 saves.
* May 15, 1990: After hardly playing in overtime, Petr Klima came off the bench late in triple overtime and scored almost immediately to end the longest overtime in NHL Finals history, with 4:47 left. The goal gave the Edmonton Oilers a 3–2 victory over the Boston Bruins to open the 1990 Stanley Cup Finals, setting the stage for the Oilers&#x27; fifth cup in seven years.
* April 24, 1993: In game four of the Adams division semi-final between the Buffalo Sabres and the Boston Bruins, Sabres forward Brad May scores in overtime to give Buffalo a 6–5 win and a four-game sweep of the Bruins in the series. Due to Buffalo commentator Rick Jeanneret&#x27;s colorful play call when May scored, this game has been referred to in Buffalo as &quot;May Day&quot;.
* April to June 1993: After losing in overtime of game one of the Adams division semi-final to the Quebec Nordiques, the Montreal Canadiens go on to win ten consecutive overtime games en route to winning the Stanley Cup. The Habs score another overtime winner the following year against the Boston Bruins, making it eleven consecutive playoff overtime wins.
* May 14, 1993: In game seven of the Patrick Division Finals, David Volek who spent most of the season as a healthy scratch, scored the series winning goal to give the New York Islanders a 4–3 victory ending the Pittsburgh Penguins chances at a three-peat.
* April 27, 1994: Dominik Hašek of the Buffalo Sabres stops all 70 shots produced by the New Jersey Devils as Dave Hannan scores the lone goal over a sprawling Martin Brodeur at 5:43 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal matchup. 
* April 30, 1994: Pavel Bure scores 2:20 into double overtime of the seventh game of the opening round of Vancouver&#x27;s playoff series with Calgary. The win gives the Vancouver Canucks three consecutive overtime wins over the favored Calgary Flames, who squander a 3–1 series lead.
* May 27, 1994: Stéphane Matteau scores the game-winning goal at 4:24 of double overtime with a wrap-around, beating Martin Brodeur and the New Jersey Devils in game seven, advancing the New York Rangers to the Stanley Cup Finals (where they would ultimately win it for the first time since 1940). It is Matteau&#x27;s second goal in double overtime periods of the series.
* April 24, 1996: Petr Nedvěd scores with 44.6 seconds remaining in quadruple overtime to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a 3–2 win over the Washington Capitals to tie their Eastern Conference quarter-final series at two games apiece.
* June 10, 1996: Uwe Krupp became the 12th player in NHL history, and the first in 16 years, to end the Stanley Cup Finals in overtime, scoring a goal at 4:31 of triple overtime, giving the Colorado Avalanche a 1–0 win and a sweep of the Florida Panthers for the title.
* June 19, 1999: Brett Hull scores with 5:09 left in triple overtime of game six to win the title for the Dallas Stars over the Buffalo Sabres. The goal is considered controversial by some fans due to disagreement on if the goal by Hull was legal or not. (see 1999 Stanley Cup Finals). Dallas won 2–1 for a 4–2 title victory.
* May 4, 2000: Keith Primeau of the Philadelphia Flyers put a shot over the left shoulder of Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender Ron Tugnutt with 7:59 left in quintuple overtime, ending the longest game since 1936.
* June 8, 2000: Jason Arnott scores on Dallas Stars&#x27; goalie Ed Belfour in double overtime of game six to give the New Jersey Devils their second title.
* April 11, 2007: Roberto Luongo, goaltender for the Vancouver Canucks, wins his first career playoff game while making 72 saves, one shy of Kelly Hrudey&#x27;s record. Henrik Sedin scores the winning goal at 18:06 of quadruple overtime in Game 1 of the Western Quarterfinals, beating the Dallas Stars 5–4. The game is Vancouver&#x27;s longest in history, and the Stars&#x27; second longest, behind their five-overtime loss to Anaheim in 2003.
* May 4, 2008: Brenden Morrow scores on San Jose Sharks goalie Evgeni Nabokov at 9:03 of quadruple overtime in game six of the Western Conference Semi-final between the Sharks and Stars. The game sees an incredible goaltending duel as Nabokov makes 53 saves in the loss while Marty Turco of Dallas makes 61 saves for the win.
* June 2, 2008: In Game 5 of the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; Petr Sýkora told Pierre Maguire of NBC that he would score the winning goal in overtime. At 9:57 of triple overtime, Sýkora scored on Detroit Red Wings&#x27; goaltender Chris Osgood and sent the series back to Pittsburgh for game six. 
* June 9, 2010: Patrick Kane of the Chicago Blackhawks shoots a goal past Philadelphia Flyers goalie Michael Leighton 4:10 into overtime of game six of the Stanley Cup Finals to give the Blackhawks a 4–3 win over the Flyers for their first title since 1961.

<text>John Henry Hobart (September 14, 1775 – September 12, 1830) was the third Episcopal bishop of New York (1816–1830). He vigorously promoted the extension of the Episcopal Church in upstate New York, as well as founded both the General Theological Seminary in New York City and Geneva College in Geneva in the Finger Lakes area (in 1852 renamed Hobart Free College after him and now operating as Hobart and William Smith Colleges). He was the beloved pastor of Elizabeth Seton before her conversion to Catholicism.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
John Henry Hobart was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Sept. 14, 1775; the son of Capt. Enoch and Hannah (Pratt) Hobart. His grandfather John Hobart had moved from Hingham, Massachusetts to Philadelphia, where he married a Swedish woman and became a member of the Anglican Church. His great-grandfather Peter Hobart was a graduate of the University of Cambridge, England, 1629, and teacher and pastor in Suffolk; he emigrated to America in 1635.

===Education===
Captain Hobart died when the future bishop was an infant, and was buried in the family tomb at Christ Church Burial Ground. At age nine, John was a pupil in the Episcopal Academy. He studied classics under professor John Andrews, 1785–90, and followed when his mentor became vice-provost of the University of Pennsylvania, which Hobart attended, 1790–91. He transferred to the junior class of the College of New Jersey (Princeton) and graduated, A.B., 1793, A.M., 1796. Hobart worked as a tutor at Princeton, 1797–98, while pursuing his studies in theology under the direction of Bishop William White.

===Ministry===
Hobart was ordained deacon by Bishop White in Philadelphia on June 3, 1798, and as a priest by Bishop Provoost on April 5, 1801, in Trinity Church. He then served as pastor of Trinity Church in Oxford and All Saints in Perkiomen Township, Pennsylvania before moving to New Jersey to serve at Christ Church, New Brunswick, New Jersey. 

Trinity Church in New York hired Hobart as its assistant minister in 1803. Hobart showed his zeal for the historic episcopacy, &quot;An Apology for Apostolic Order and its Advocates&quot; in 1807, a series of letters to John M. Mason, who, in &quot;The Christian&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, of which he was editor, had attacked the Episcopacy in general and in particular Hobart&#x27;s collection of &quot;Essays on the Subject of Episcopacy&quot; (1806).

In 1811, Hobart was elected assistant bishop of New York, with the right of succession. The ill-health of Bishop Benjamin Moore led Hobart to effectively run the diocese for several years before formally succeeding on the latter&#x27;s death in February 1816. As bishop, Hobart worked to build up his diocese, attempting to visit every parish annually. He was able, impetuous, frank, perfectly fearless in controversy, a speaker and preacher of much eloquence. A supporter of missions to the Oneida Indians, Hobart helped relocate many of the Oneida from New York State to Wisconsin.

Hobart was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. The AAS holds numerous books and pamphlets authored by or related to Hobart, including many sermons and other theologically related texts.

One of the founders of the General Theological Seminary, Hobart became its professor of Pastoral Theology in 1821, served as its first dean and governed the seminary as bishop. He opposed the plan of Philander Chase, Bishop of Ohio, for an Episcopal seminary in that diocese; but when the Ohio seminary was made directly responsible to the House of Bishops, Hobart withdrew his opposition.

Bishop Hobart supported the High Church Movement within the Episcopal Church. A predecessor of the Anglo-Catholic Movement deriving from the Oxford Movement in the 1830s and 40s, the High Church movement, like the Anglo-Catholic, stressed continuity with the pre-Protestant Reformation church, while at the same time strongly opposed certain Roman Catholic doctrines. The movement emphasized the Apostolic Succession and Anglican Covenantal Theology. In contrast to the later Anglo-Catholic movement, Hobart&#x27;s High Churchmanship did not have a significant liturgical character. Hobart emphasized the significance of baptism and apostolic succession, and how the apostolic succession affected Episcopal ecumenical relationships and ministry with &quot;non-apostolic&quot; churches. The seminary became a center for the High Church Movement and later for the Oxford Movement in America. Through General Seminary, Hobart in particular influenced two future bishops: Benjamin Onderdonk and Jackson Kemper.

Hobart also opposed the American Bible Society, perhaps part of his strong opposition to dissenting churches. In 1816 he published a pamphlet to dissuade Episcopalians from joining the new movement, which he thought the Protestant Episcopal Church had not the numerical or the financial strength to control. 

Instead, in 1818, to counterbalance the Bible Society&#x27;s influence and especially of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Hobart began to edit the &quot;Family Bible&quot; of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He also delivered episcopal charges to the clergy of Connecticut and New York entitled &quot;The Churchman&quot; (1819) and &quot;The High Churchman Vindicated&quot; (1826), in which Hobart accepted the label high churchman, explaining his principles to distinguish them from the corruptions of the Church of Rome and from the Errors of Certain Protestant Sects.

By 1818, Hobart had also become convinced that an institution of higher education was needed in the western reaches of the state of New York. Though he had visited many areas as a bishop, he selected the small village of Geneva on Seneca Lake for his new outpost of learning. The site for the new Geneva College was selected in 1820, and the first building erected in 1822. Geneva College became Hobart Free College, later renamed Hobart College in 1852 in honor of its founder, and which became Hobart and William Smith Colleges.

In failing health, Hobart visited Europe from 1823 to 1825. Upon his return, he preached a sermon entitled &quot;The United States of America compared with some European Countries, particularly England&quot; (published 1826). Hobart so criticized the establishment, state patronage, cabinet appointment of bishops, low discipline, and the low requirements of theological education, as to rouse much hostility in England, where he had been highly praised for two volumes of &quot;Sermons on the Principal Events and Truths of Redemption&quot; (1824).

==Death and legacy==
Bishop Hobart died at Auburn, New York, on September 12, 1830, and is buried at Trinity Churchyard near his beloved General Theological Seminary in Manhattan. The Episcopal Church remembers Bishop Hobart annually on the anniversary of his death, September 12.

Robert Pritchard notes that &quot;Hobart&#x27;s powerful personality, his skill as a writer and polemicist , the pervasive influence of his former assistants, and his influence on the General Theological Seminary combined to make his theological stance the standard for the high-church party in the first half of the nineteenth century.&quot; High church theology before the American Civil War is now known as the &quot;Hobartian Synthesis&quot; or &quot;Hobartian High-Churchmanship&quot;.

The village of Hobart, New York was named after him in 1828. The Church of the Holy Apostles in Oneida, Wisconsin was dedicated in his memory, and nearby Hobart, in Brown County, Wisconsin, was named for him in 1908.

<doc id="568096" wikidata="Q5449375" url="?curid=568096" title="Final Descent (album)">
<text>Final Descent is the third and final studio album by American deathrock band Samhain, first released in 1990, more than three years after lead singer Glenn Danzig and bassist Eerie Von had recruited guitarist John Christ and drummer Chuck Biscuits to form Danzig.

==Original release==
Tracks 1-5 are previously unreleased songs, at least some of which had been intended for the &quot;Samhain Grim&quot; album before it was aborted when the band changed its personnel, and finally its name, to Danzig. Tracks 6-11 had been released in 1987 on the first pressing of the &quot;Initium&quot; CD. These songs were in fact overdubbed (partially re-recorded) and remixed versions of those on the 1985 &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; E.P.

Eerie Von has confirmed that &quot;Death...In Its Arms&quot; was recorded during the sessions for Danzig&#x27;s second album, &quot;Danzig II: Lucifuge&quot;, and features the full original Danzig lineup: singer Glenn Danzig, guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and drummer Chuck Biscuits.

Like all of Samhain&#x27;s discography, and most of Danzig&#x27;s prior work with the Misfits, &quot;Final Descent&quot; was originally released on Danzig&#x27;s independent record label Plan 9, distributed by Caroline Records.

Apart from the band&#x27;s reissues in 2000–01, this is the only Samhain release that does not have a 12&quot; vinyl counterpart. Glenn Danzig said that some vinyl sleeves were made, but further plans to release the album on vinyl in 1990 were scrapped because he was not pleased with them.

The 1990 CD was issued in a longbox in some markets, and came with a large sticker on the cellophane wrapping, which read, &quot;Samhain: Final Descent&quot; (in the same font used for the original 1976 horror/suspense motion picture &quot;The Omen&quot; and its three sequels). The 2001 reissue CD featured this phrase printed on the CD booklet itself.

==Reissues==
In 2000 most of Samhain&#x27;s catalogue, including &quot;Final Descent&quot;, was re-released as part of the &quot;Samhain Box Set&quot; on Danzig&#x27;s new label, Evilive, distributed by E-Magine Music. Its reissue as an individual CD followed in 2001.
On these reissues, the original tracks 6-11 formed a separate &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; CD. On the &quot;Final Descent&quot; CD they were replaced with four unreleased &quot;Samhain Grim&quot; demos. Two of these tracks are earlier versions of songs that had appeared on Danzig&#x27;s debut album: &quot;Twist of Cain&quot; and &quot;Possession&quot;. &quot;Trouble&quot; is a cover of an Elvis Presley song recorded for the film &quot;King Creole&quot;. A re-recording of the song is featured on the Danzig EP, &quot;Thrall-Demonsweatlive&quot;. The fourth track is an earlier alternate version of the &quot;Final Descent&quot; track &quot;Lords of the Left Hand&quot;. This alternate version was recorded in September 1986, while the &quot;original version&quot; was not recorded until September 1987, and was not mixed in its final form until 1990.

The Samhain Box Set and individual CD reissues of this album incorrectly reverse the listing of tracks 7 and 9. The correct order of the songs as they are played on the CD is listed below. The misprinted track listing actually conforms to the order of the songs on earlier bootlegged audio copies of this recording session.

==Personnel==
=== Tracks 1–5 ===

A family house in Khomeyn was the birthplace of former supreme leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The house became a historical monument and museum.

The house was set on fire on 17 November 2022 during the Mahsa Amini protests; and days after the death of Kian Pirfalak, an Iranian child killed during the Izeh Bazaar Massacre. Online social media showed a crowd cheering as flames were seen emerging from the house. &quot;Tasnim News Agency&quot; denied that a fire had occurred and stated that the house was &quot;open to the public&quot;.
==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 64,031 in 17,399 households. The following census in 2011 counted 70,053 people in 21,477 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 72,882 people in 23,334 households.

==Geography==

<doc id="568104" wikidata="Q2049775" url="?curid=568104" title="Air quotes">
<text>Air quotes, also called finger quotes, are virtual quotation marks formed in the air with one&#x27;s fingers when speaking. The gesture is typically done with both hands held shoulder-width apart and at the eye or shoulders level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing at the beginning and end of the phrase being quoted. The air-quoted phrase is, in the most common usage, a few words. Air quotes are often used to express satire, sarcasm, irony or euphemism and are analogous to scare quotes in print.

== History ==
Use of similar gestures has been recorded as early as 1927, and Glenda Farrell used air quotes in a 1937 screwball comedy, &quot;Breakfast for Two.&quot; In 1889, in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s last novel, the author described air brackets and an air question mark. The term &quot;air quotes&quot; first appeared in a 1989 &quot;Spy&quot; magazine article by Paul Rudnick and Kurt Andersen, who state it became a common gesture around 1980.

The gesture was used routinely in the TV show &quot;Celebrity Charades&quot; (1979) as the standard signal for a quote or phrase. In the 1965 &quot;Bewitched&quot; episode &quot;Prodigy&quot;, Gladys Kravitz (played by Alice Pearce) uses air quotes several times while reciting reviews of her brother&#x27;s violin recitals.
In the episode &quot;Nurse&#x27;s Wild&quot; of TV show &quot;Emergency!&quot; (1972), the character Roy DeSoto uses air quotes at Rampart Hospital base station.
The gesture became very popular in the 1990s and was frequently used by comedian Steve Martin in stand-up comedy shows. Another popularization of air quotes was the character Bennett Brauer, played on the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Chris Farley, an aggressive but socially awkward commentator who used air quotes to mock societal expectations of him. Additionally, in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film series, Dr. Evil makes exaggerated use of air quotes when explaining matters to his henchmen, particularly while using real phrases he erroneously believes himself to have coined such as &quot;laser&quot; and &quot;Death Star.&quot; Donald Trump used air quotes when he criticized “quote-President” Obama&#x27;s refugee policies.

== Meaning ==
&quot;The&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; calls air quotes &quot;a snide, easy way to discredit or distance oneself from the other side’s words.&quot;

<doc id="568105" wikidata="Q449900" url="?curid=568105" title="George Segal">
<text>George Segal Jr. (February 13, 1934 – March 23, 2021) was an American actor. He became popular in the 1960s and 1970s for playing both dramatic and comedic roles. After first rising to prominence with roles in acclaimed films such as &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; (1965) and &quot;King Rat&quot; (1965), he co-starred in the classic drama &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966).

Through the next decade and a half, Segal consistently starred in notable films across a variety of genres including &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966), &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; (1967), &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; (1968), &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970), &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1972), &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973), &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973), &quot;California Split&quot; (1974), &quot;The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox&quot; (1976), &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (1977), &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Last Married Couple in America&quot; (1980). He was one of the first American film actors to rise to leading man status with an unchanged Jewish surname, helping pave the way for other major actors of his generation.

Later in his career, he appeared in supporting roles in films such as &quot;Carbon Copy&quot; (1981), &quot;Stick&quot; (1985), &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1989), &quot;For the Boys&quot; (1991), &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996), &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; (1996), &quot;2012&quot; (2009), and &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot; (2010).

He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; and won two Golden Globe Awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his performance in &quot;A Touch of Class&quot;.

On television, he was best known for his regular roles in two popular sitcoms, playing Jack Gallo on &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (1997–2003) and Albert &quot;Pops&quot; Solomon on &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; (2013–2021). Segal was also an accomplished banjo player. (In addition to the banjo, he frequently played other small lute instruments such as the ukulele and dobro on TV and in his movies.) He released three albums and performed with the instrument in several of his acting roles and on late-night television.

== Early life ==
George Segal Jr. was born in New York City, the youngest of four children, to Fannie Blanche Segal (&quot;née&quot; Bodkin) and George Segal Sr., a malt and hop agent. He spent much of his childhood in Great Neck, New York. All four of Segal&#x27;s grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants, and his maternal grandparents changed their surname from Slobodkin to Bodkin. A paternal great-grandfather ran for governor of Massachusetts as a socialist. His oldest brother, John, worked in the hops brokerage business and was an innovator in the cultivation of new hop varieties; he had a farm in Grandview, Washington where George often helped in the summers. The middle brother, Fred, was a screenwriter; and his sister Greta died of pneumonia before Segal was born.

Segal&#x27;s family was Jewish, but he was raised in a secular household. When asked if he had had a bar mitzvah, he said:
I&#x27;m afraid not. I went to a Passover Seder at Groucho Marx&#x27;s once and he kept saying, &quot;When do we get to the wine?&quot; So that&#x27;s my [Jewish] experience. I went to [a friend&#x27;s] bar mitzvah, and that was the only time I was in Temple Beth Shalom. [Jewish life] wasn&#x27;t happening that much at the time. People&#x27;s car tires were slashed in front of the temple. I was once kicked down a flight of stairs by some kids from [the local parochial school].

Segal became interested in acting at the age of nine, when he saw Alan Ladd in &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;. &quot;I knew the revolver and the trench coat were an illusion and I didn&#x27;t care,&quot; said Segal. &quot;I liked the sense of adventure and control.&quot; He also started playing the banjo at a young age, later stating: &quot;I started off with the ukulele when I was a kid in Great Neck. A friend had a red Harold Teen model; it won my heart. When I got to high school, I realized you couldn&#x27;t play in a band with a ukulele, so I moved on to the four-string banjo.&quot;

When his father died in 1947, Segal moved to New York City with his mother. He graduated from George School, a Quaker boarding school in Pennsylvania, in 1951 and attended Haverford College. He graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts in performing arts and drama. He played banjo at Haverford and also at Columbia, where he played with a dixieland jazz band that had several different names. When he booked a gig, he billed the group as Bruno Lynch and his Imperial Jazz Band. The group, which later settled on the name Red Onion Jazz Band, played at Segal&#x27;s first wedding.

Segal served in the United States Army during the Korean War. While there, he played in a band called Corporal Bruno&#x27;s Sad Sack Six.

== Career ==
=== Early roles and success ===
After college and the army, Segal eventually studied at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg and at HB Studio with Uta Hagen and got a job as an understudy in the 1956 off-Broadway production of &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot; starring Jason Robards. He appeared in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; for Joseph Papp and joined an improvisational group called The Premise, which performed at a Bleecker Street coffeehouse and whose ranks included Buck Henry and Theodore J. Flicker. Segal continued to perform on Broadway with roles in &quot;Gideon&quot; (1961–62) by Paddy Chayefsky, which ran for 236 performances, as well as &quot;Rattle of a Simple Man&quot; (1963), an adaptation of a British hit, with Tammy Grimes and Edward Woodward.

He was signed to a Columbia Pictures contract in 1961, making his film debut in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. Segal made several television appearances in the early 1960s, including &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Armstrong Circle Theatre&quot;, and &quot;Naked City&quot;, and appeared in the well-known World War II film &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (1962). He also had a small role in &quot;Act One&quot; (1963) and a more prominent part in the western &quot;Invitation to a Gunfighter&quot; (1964) alongside Yul Brynner.
Segal came to Hollywood from New York City to star in a TV series with Robert Taylor that never aired. Nonetheless, he joined the cast of Columbia Pictures&#x27; medical drama &quot;The New Interns&quot; (1964), and the studio then put him under long-term contract. The role ultimately earned him the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year, alongside Harve Presnell and Chaim Topol.

=== Critical acclaim ===
In 1965, Segal played an egocentric painter in an ensemble cast led by Vivien Leigh and Lee Marvin in Stanley Kramer&#x27;s acclaimed drama &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. The same year, he also had the title role of a scheming POW in the well-regarded war drama &quot;King Rat&quot; (a role originally meant for Frank Sinatra) and received acclaim for both performances. In other notable film appearances, he played a secret service agent on assignment in Berlin in &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966) (a role originally meant for Charlton Heston), an Algerian paratrooper who becomes a leader of the FLN in &quot;Lost Command&quot; (1966), and a Cagney-esque gangster in Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot; (1967).

Segal also appeared in several prominent television films, playing Biff in an acclaimed production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; (1966) next to Lee J. Cobb, a gangster in an adaptation of &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; (1967), and George in an adaptation of &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1968). The latter two films were both directed by Ted Kotcheff, with whom he worked again several times.

Segal was loaned to Warner Bros. for Mike Nichols&#x27; directorial debut &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966), a now-classic adaptation of the Edward Albee play. Nichols had previously directed Segal in a 1964 Off-Broadway play titled &quot;The Knack&quot; and cast him again in &quot;Woolf&quot; after Robert Redford had turned down the role. In the four-person ensemble piece, Segal played the young faculty member, Nick, alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, and Sandy Dennis. The film, which received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and was later selected to the National Film Registry, is arguably Segal&#x27;s best known and, for his role, he was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe.

The same year, Segal released his debut LP, &quot;The Yama Yama Man&quot;. The title track is a ragtime version of the 1908 tune &quot;The Yama Yama Man&quot; with horns and banjos. Segal released the album at a time when he appeared regularly playing banjo on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. In the same year, Segal played banjo and sang with The Smothers Brothers when they performed Phil Ochs&#x27;s &quot;Draft Dodger Rag&quot; on their CBS television show.

=== Leading man ===
For over ten years after his success with &quot;Woolf&quot;, Segal received many notable film roles, often working with major filmmakers and becoming a significant figure in the New Hollywood movement. He starred in Carl Reiner&#x27;s celebrated dark comedy &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970), played the lead role in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot; (1968), starred with Robert Redford in Peter Yates&#x27;s diamond heist comedy &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1972), starred in the title role of Paul Mazursky&#x27;s acclaimed romantic comedy &quot;Blume in Love&quot; (1973), and starred alongside Elliott Gould as a gambling addict in Robert Altman&#x27;s classic &quot;California Split&quot; (1974), considered by some to be the greatest gambling film of all time.

In one of his most successful roles, Segal played a philandering husband in Melvin Frank&#x27;s continental romantic comedy &quot;A Touch of Class&quot; (1973) opposite Glenda Jackson. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, Jackson won an Oscar for her performance, and Segal won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, which was the second Golden Globe of his career.

During this time, he had many other leading roles in various genres. He played a perplexed police detective in &quot;No Way to Treat a Lady&quot; (1968), a war-weary platoon commander in &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; (1969), a man laying waste to his marriage in &quot;Loving&quot; (1970), and a hairdresser-turned-junkie in &quot;Born to Win&quot; (1971). &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), a romantic comedy starring Segal and Barbra Streisand and written by his former improv teammate Buck Henry, was particularly popular; and though Segal played against type as a dangerous computer scientist in &quot;The Terminal Man&quot; (1974), he used his popular appeal as a card shark in &quot;The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox&quot; (1976), as a suburbanite-turned-bank robber in &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot; (1977), as a heroic ride inspector in &quot;Rollercoaster&quot; (1977), and as a wealthy serial restaurant entrepreneur in &quot;Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?&quot; (1978). Other films starring Segal from this time include &quot;The Girl Who Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot; (1968), &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Black Bird&quot; (1975).

Segal co-hosted the 48th Academy Awards in 1976, alongside Gene Kelly, Goldie Hawn, Walter Matthau, and Robert Shaw.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Segal appeared as a frequent guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and occasionally as a guest host. His appearances were marked by eccentric banter with Johnny Carson and were usually punctuated by bursts of banjo playing. In addition to playing banjo while appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Segal played the instrument in several of his acting roles and sang in others, such as &quot;Blume in Love&quot;.

George Segal and the Imperial Jazzband released the album &quot;A Touch of Ragtime&quot; in 1974, with Segal on banjo. He made frequent television appearances with the &quot;Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band&quot;, whose members included actor Conrad Janis on trombone, and in 1981 they performed live at Carnegie Hall.

=== Mid-career difficulties ===
Segal reunited with his &quot;Touch of Class&quot; co-star Jackson and director Frank in another European-set romantic comedy, &quot;Lost and Found&quot; (1979), but the film was not a success. Neither was &quot;The Last Married Couple in America&quot; (1980) with Natalie Wood. Segal famously pulled out of the lead role in Blake Edwards&#x27; hit comedy &quot;10&quot; (1979), resulting in his being replaced by Dudley Moore and sued by Edwards.

With a few exceptions, in films such as Denzel Washington&#x27;s film debut &quot;Carbon Copy&quot; (1981), Burt Reynolds&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Stick&quot; (1985), and the popular family comedy &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; (1989), Segal received fewer prominent roles in the 1980s. Instead, he began to star more frequently in television films, such as &quot;The Deadly Game&quot; (1982) for which he received a CableAce Award nomination for best actor in a theatrical or non-musical production, &quot;The Cold Room&quot; (1984), and &quot;The Zany Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1984). He also starred in two short-lived television series, the semi-autobiographical sitcom &quot;Take Five&quot; (1987) and the crime drama &quot;Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot; (1988–89). In 1985, he returned to Broadway in a short-lived production of &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; by Rod Serling and in 1990 toured in a play called &quot;Double Act&quot;.

He later reflected on his career trajectory:
In the first 10 years, I was playing all different kinds of things. I loved the variety, and never had the sense of being a leading man but a character actor. Then I got frozen into this &quot;urban&quot; character. About the time of &quot;The Last Married Couple in America&quot; (1980) I remember Natalie (Wood) saying to me ... &quot;It&#x27;s one typed role after another, and pretty soon you forget everything. You forget why you&#x27;re here, why you&#x27;re doing it.&quot; Then my marriage started to fall apart ... I was disenchanted, I was turning in on myself, I was doing a lot of self-destructive things ... there were drugs ... I&#x27;m also sure I was guilty of spoiled behavior. I think it&#x27;s impossible when that star rush comes not to get a little full of yourself, which is what I was.

=== Later career ===
Nevertheless, after this relatively dry period, Segal re-established himself as a successful character actor in the 1990s. Though he appeared in some less-acclaimed films, he also worked with directors such as Mark Rydell, Gus Van Sant, Barbra Streisand, David O. Russell, Randal Kleiser, and Ben Stiller, respectively, in well-received films such as &quot;For the Boys&quot; (1991), &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995), &quot;The Mirror Has Two Faces&quot; (1996), &quot;Flirting with Disaster&quot; (1996), &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot; (1996), and &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996). Additionally, he had guest appearances on various shows such as &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; and &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; and continued to appear in television films such as &quot;Seasons of the Heart&quot; (1994), &quot;Houdini&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Linda McCartney Story&quot; (2000). In 1999, he briefly performed in Yasmina Reza&#x27;s &quot;Art&quot; on Broadway, and in 2001 he reprised his performance in the West End.

From 1997 to 2003, Segal had his most prominent role in years when he starred in the NBC workplace sitcom &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; as Jack Gallo, the successful yet often oblivious owner and publisher of a New York City fashion magazine. For this role, he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy in 1999 and 2000 as well as a Satellite Award in 2002. The show, which also starred David Spade and Laura San Giacomo, among others, and which once aired between iconic sitcoms &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, lasted for seven seasons and 148 episodes.

After finishing his run on &quot;Just Shoot Me&quot;, Segal appeared in supporting roles in films such as &quot;Heights&quot; (2005) and &quot;2012&quot; (2009). He and Jill Clayburgh cameoed as Jake Gyllenhaal&#x27;s parents in &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot; (2010), reuniting the co-stars 46 years after they first worked together in &quot;The Terminal Man&quot;. Additionally, Segal worked more frequently as a voice actor, including a role in the English-language version of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of the Princess Kaguya&quot; (2013) and a comedic reprisal of his &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; role in a 2018 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. His most recent film performance was alongside Christopher Plummer in &quot;Elsa &amp; Fred&quot; (2014). In other roles, Segal played talent manager Murray Berenson in three episodes of the television series &quot;Entourage&quot; (2009), guest starred in shows such as &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot;, and &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, appeared in comedic short videos such as &quot;Chutzpuh, This Is&quot;, and starred in the TV Land sitcom &quot;Retired at 35&quot; (2011–2012), alongside his &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot; co-star Jessica Walter.

Segal had another success when he starred in the ABC sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; (2013–2021), playing Albert &quot;Pops&quot; Solomon, the eccentric but lovable grandfather of a semi-autobiographical family based on that of series creator Adam F. Goldberg. The long-running series entered its eighth season in 2021, and Segal was part of the regular cast up until his death in March of that year. Throughout the show, Segal had appeared in most, though not all, episodes and, as in some of his earlier roles, he played the banjo several times on-screen.

In 2017, Segal received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the category of Television.

==Personal life and death==
Segal was married three times. He married film editor Marion Segal Freed in 1956, who would go on to work as an associate producer or editor on three of his films. They had two daughters and were together until their divorce in 1983. From 1983 until her death in 1996, he was married to Linda Rogoff, a one-time manager of The Pointer Sisters whom he met at Carnegie Hall when he played the banjo with his band the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band. He married his former George School boarding school classmate Sonia Schultz Greenbaum in 1998.

Later in his life, Segal lived part-time in Sonoma County when he was not filming &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; in Los Angeles.

Segal died of complications from bypass surgery in Santa Rosa, California, on March 23, 2021, at age 87.

<text>Chris Gbandi (born April 7, 1979) is a Liberian former footballer who is currently the head coach of the UConn Huskies men&#x27;s soccer team.

== Career ==

=== College ===
Gbandi played college soccer at the University of Connecticut, where he was a finalist for the Hermann Trophy in 1999 and 2001, and a winner in 2000 (he was named First Team All-American during his last two years in college).

=== Professional ===
Gbandi was drafted with the first overall pick of the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by Dallas Burn, but missed all of the 2002 season while rehabilitating a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). He returned in the 2003 season, where he registered one goal and two assists after playing 22 games in a disappointing campaign for the Burn. Gbandi played in another 23 games in 2004. In 2005, Gbandi made 17 appearances, all starts, and scored what happened to be the last goal ever scored at the Cotton Bowl by an FC Dallas player. 2006 was his best season yet, Gbandi played in 28 games and earned FC Dallas&#x27;s defender of the year honors. Over the off season, Gbandi had a trial with IK Start, but nothing became of it.

2007 was another good year for Gbandi, he made 21 appearances and scored a spectacular goal against Real Salt Lake.

On February 8, 2008, he completed a transfer to Norwegian club FK Haugesund, where he spent the next two seasons, scoring 5 goals in 37 appearances for the team.

Gbandi returned to the United States in 2010 when he signed with USSF Division 2 club Miami FC.

=== International ===
It was speculated that Gbandi might cap for the United States national team, but in 2004 he accepted an offer from the Liberian national team to compete in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, making him ineligible for the US squad.

=== Coaching ===
Gbandi served as an assistant coach at UConn, Holy Cross, and Dartmouth before earning his first head coaching job at Northeastern. He was named head coach at UConn on December 17, 2021.
== Personal ==
Gbandi&#x27;s brother, Sandy Gbandi, is also a former professional footballer.

<text>Parker Christian Posey (born November 8, 1968) is an American actress. She was known for her roles in independent films in the 1990s, such as &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993), &quot;Party Girl&quot;, &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;, &quot;Kicking and Screaming&quot; (all 1995), &quot;The Daytrippers&quot; (1996), &quot;The House of Yes&quot;, &quot;Clockwatchers&quot; (both 1997), and &quot;Henry Fool&quot; (1998). She has received nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award.

Although she began to work in bigger projects during the late 1990s, Posey has continued to work in small-scale features such as &quot;Personal Velocity: Three Portraits&quot; (2002), &quot;Fay Grim&quot; (2006), &quot;Broken English&quot; (2007), and &quot;Columbus&quot; (2017). Her more mainstream credits include &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998), &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000), &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; (2001), &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; (2002), &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), &quot;Café Society&quot; (2016), and &quot;Beau Is Afraid&quot; (2023). She frequently works with Christopher Guest and has co-starred in several of his mockumentaries: &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; (1996), &quot;Best in Show&quot; (2000), &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; (2006), and &quot;Mascots&quot; (2016).

On television, Posey appeared in the recurring role on BYUtv&#x27;s &quot;Granite Flats&quot; (2015), co-starred on all three seasons of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (2018–2021), and earned praise for the HBO Max miniseries &quot;The Staircase&quot; (2022). She has since starred in the third season of the HBO anthology series &quot;The White Lotus&quot; (2025).

==Early life==
Posey was born November 8, 1968, in Baltimore, Maryland, to Lynda (née Patton), a chef, and Chris Posey, owner of a car dealership. She has a twin brother, Christopher. After Posey&#x27;s birth, her family lived in Monroe, Louisiana, for 11 years. They later moved to Laurel, Mississippi, where her mother worked as a chef and culinary instructor for the Viking Range Corporation in Greenwood and her father operated a car dealership. Posey was raised Catholic.

==Career==

===Acting===
Posey attended the State University of New York at Purchase, where she studied drama.

Posey got her first break in television with the role of Tess Shelby on the daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Posey&#x27;s first major role in a feature film was in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993). 

In 1994, she appeared in Hal Hartley&#x27;s short film &quot;Opera No. 1&quot;. Throughout the late 1990s, Posey co-starred in 32 independent films and was nicknamed &quot;Queen of the Indies&quot;. These films include &quot;Basquiat&quot;, &quot;Clockwatchers&quot;, &quot;The Daytrippers&quot;, &quot;Party Girl&quot; and &quot;The House of Yes&quot;. In particular, she received positive reviews for &quot;The House of Yes&quot;, for her role as a delusional woman in love with her own brother. In an interview in January 2012, Parker said that the unofficial title has sometimes been a hindrance:

She has co-starred in many of Christopher Guest&#x27;s films, including five of his mock documentaries, the first being &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; in 1996. In 1998, Posey appeared in Hartley&#x27;s film &quot;Henry Fool&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;.

In 2000, she starred in Guest&#x27;s third mock documentary &quot;Best in Show&quot; and in the big-budget horror film &quot;Scream 3&quot;. Critical reaction to Posey&#x27;s performance in the latter film was highly positive and earned her an MTV Movie Award nomination. The next year she starred in &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;. From 2001 to 2002, she appeared in a supporting role in the popular NBC sitcom &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;.

In 2003, she starred in Guest&#x27;s &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;. The next year she appeared in &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, &quot;Laws of Attraction&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Posey then co-starred in the 2005 film &quot;Adam &amp; Steve&quot;.

In 2006, Posey appeared in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; as Kitty Kowalski, Lex Luthor&#x27;s ditzy sidekick, a character based on Eve Teschmacher from the 1978 film &quot;Superman&quot;. Posey was the only actress considered for the role. &quot;Superman Returns&quot; was a box-office success. The film was also successful at the 33rd Saturn Awards. Posey, a few fellow cast members, and the visual effects department were all nominated. Later the same year, she played the title character in &quot;Fay Grim&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Henry Fool&quot;, and appeared in &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;.

In 2007, Posey was cast in the lead role in the television series &quot;The Return of Jezebel James&quot;. The show was originally given a 13-episode order, but the show was cut to seven episodes in anticipation of a pending scriptwriters’ strike. It premiered on the Fox television network in 2008 as a mid-season replacement. However, the show was officially canceled after the third episode aired owing to low ratings.

Posey starred in Zoe Cassavetes&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Broken English&quot;. &quot;Broken English&quot; screened at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. It was also entered into the 29th Moscow International Film Festival. The film was nominated at the 23rd Independent Spirit Awards for Best First Screenplay and Posey was nominated for Best Female Lead. She was set to co-star in John Waters&#x27; film &quot;Fruitcake&quot;. The film was to be set in her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland. However, in 2018, Waters announced that he had canceled &quot;Fruitcake&quot;, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t get it made... I thought it would do well, but it&#x27;s not. In this economy, I&#x27;m going to have to do a puppet show.&quot;

In 2012, Posey starred in four episodes of the third season of &quot;Louie&quot; as Liz, Louis C.K.&#x27;s love interest. She received positive reviews for her stint on the show. The website &quot;Vulture&quot; stated: &quot;Posey is superb in a brilliantly written role.&quot; Lindsay Bahr of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;Posey used her arsenal of talent and the material written and directed by C.K. to bring Liz to life&quot;. Andy Greenwald of &quot;GrantLand&quot; felt Posey was &quot;funny, engaging, and breathless&quot; and went on to call Posey &quot;one of the most gifted actors alive&quot;. Later the same year, she was honored with the Excellence in Acting Award at the Provincetown International Film Festival.

Posey appeared in &quot;Ned Rifle&quot;, the third and final film in Hartley&#x27;s &quot;Henry Fool&quot; trilogy, again reprising her role of Fay Grim. On November 6, 2013, Hartley launched a fundraising campaign through Kickstarter to produce the film, netting a total of $384,000. Posey, along with several other cast members as well as some crew members, appeared in several videos promoting the campaign. The film premiered on September 7, 2014, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. It was also screened in the Panorama section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival on February 6, 2015.

In July 2014, it was announced that Posey had signed on to co-star in Woody Allen&#x27;s mystery drama &quot;Irrational Man&quot;. The film had its world premiere on May 16, 2015, at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. In July 2015, Parker revealed that before being cast in the film, she had considered quitting acting, as she feared that she &quot;saw the independent film movement go away from me... it&#x27;s a world market now. They&#x27;re made from real star power. Whoever&#x27;s hot at the moment.&quot; When Allen cast her, she cried, as &quot;the independent film way of working is something that was in my bones. It&#x27;s like being a part of a punk band but no one&#x27;s singing punk rock anymore. Only a few bands are able to play, and Woody Allen is one of them. That&#x27;s why I cried. It was a relief.&quot;

From 2018 to 2021, she appeared as Dr. Smith in &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, the Netflix remake of the 1965 TV series.

In 2022, she starred in episode two of &quot;Tales of the Walking Dead&quot;, an anthology series based on the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

In February 2025, Posey began appearing in the main cast of the third season of the HBO anthology series &quot;The White Lotus&quot;; which was filmed in Thailand in February 2024.

==== Audio fiction ====
In late 2019, Posey starred in an audio fiction podcast called &quot;Hunted&quot; wherein she plays the part of a U.S. Deputy Marshal tracking four escaped convicts from a federal maximum-security correctional facility. The eight-episode show is produced by Wolf Entertainment and Endeavor Audio.

===Stage and music===
Posey appeared on Broadway in 2000, playing in Elaine May&#x27;s &quot;Taller Than a Dwarf&quot;, which was directed by Alan Arkin. She later appeared off Broadway in David Rabe&#x27;s &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; in 2005, and then originated the role of Pony Jones in Will Eno&#x27;s &quot;The Realistic Joneses&quot; in 2012.

She learned to play the mandolin to prepare for her role in &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; (2003), a film in which she also sang. She provided vocals on several of her ex-boyfriend Ryan Adams&#x27; records. She also played the mandolin on The Dandy Warhols track &quot;I Am Sound&quot; from their &quot;Welcome to the Monkey House&quot; LP.

=== Memoir ===
&quot;You&#x27;re on an Airplane: A Self-Mythologizing Memoir&quot; (2018, Blue Rider Press) is Posey&#x27;s first book. Centered on the idea that the reader is sitting next to Posey on an airplane, the book mixes personal anecdotes from her career, random observations, stories about her life, and homemade photo collages. The book received critical acclaim. &quot;Vogue&quot; wrote &quot;Excellent... a celebration of peculiarity.&quot; According to &quot;Elle&quot; magazine, the memoir is &quot;a humour-packed, irreverent, eccentric book packed with personal stories, whimsical how-tos and recipes, as well as collages made by her.&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot; wrote &quot;Posey is a natural storyteller; performing, in any way really, is mostly about sharing stories. And she&#x27;s gathered some good ones for her memoir, which also perfectly encapsulates the delightful weirdo you assume she is just by watching her play different people on screen.&quot;

==Personal life==
Posey has lived in both Greenwich Village and the East Village in New York City.

<doc id="568116" wikidata="Q1517991" url="?curid=568116" title="Slapshot">
<text>A slapshot (also spelled as slap shot) is a powerful shot in ice hockey. Its advantage is a high-speed shot that can be taken from a long distance; the disadvantage is the long time to set it up as well as its low accuracy.

It has four stages which are executed in one fluid motion to launch the puck toward the net:
# The player winds up his hockey stick to shoulder height or higher.
# The player violently &quot;slaps&quot; the ice slightly behind the puck and uses his weight to bend the stick, storing energy into it like a spring. This bending of the stick gives the slapshot its speed. Just like a bow and arrow, the stick&#x27;s tendency to return to being straight is transferred to the puck, giving it much more speed than just hitting it alone could.
# When the face of the stick blade strikes the puck, the player rolls his wrists and shifts his weight so that the energy stored in the stick is released through the puck.
# Finally, the player follows through, ending up with the stick pointed towards the desired target.

The slapshot is a hard and fast shot, and difficult to make accurate. It also takes longer to execute; a player usually cannot take a slapshot while under any significant pressure from an opponent because they could easily interfere during the windup. Offensive players, when wary of a defensive player intervening, may elect to take a shot that is quicker to set up, such as a wrist shot. The slapshot is most commonly used by a defenceman at the point, especially during a power play, although a forward will sometimes find an opportunity to use it. Slapshots are iconic to hockey&#x27;s image due to their capability to score as a surprise turning point, the loose equivalent of a home run in baseball or a Hail Mary in American football.

==Origin, history, and usage==
The invention of the slapshot is credited to Bernard &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Geoffrion (a nickname alluding to the thunderous clack of his slapshots) of the Montreal Canadiens. Black Canadian Eddie Martin, of the Coloured Hockey League&#x27;s Halifax Eurekas, has also been credited with inventing the slapshot in the late 1800s. Dick Irvin, who was a star player in the WCHL and PCHA – and who later coached Geoffrion with the Habs – was also renowned for having a hard and accurate slapshot. Growing up in Winnipeg in the 1890s and 1900s, he would practice shooting against a doorknob in his attic during the winter months for accuracy. In the summertime, Irvin would draw a chalk outline of a net onto his family&#x27;s sled garage, and practice one timers off a piece of wooden board embedded into the ground.

Starting in the 2010s, usage of the slapshot at the highest levels of professional play (such as the NHL) has declined, with the exception of the one-timer shot. This is due to a number of reasons. Defensively, players are much faster and more adept at blocking shooting lanes, punishing the comparatively slow setup time of a slapshot. Better equipment has made players less fearful about blocking extremely fast shots with their bodies. Even if a defenceman does not close on the puck in time, goalies are better prepared and know that a slapshot is likely a direct shot to compensate for accuracy issues, and can quickly square up to block a slapshot with their body. Offensively, modern composite ice hockey sticks are lighter and more flexible than classic 20th century wooden sticks, which has enabled accurate wrist shots from further out than was feasible before. With the accuracy flaw fixed, players have preferred the faster setup to take a wrist shot to better surprise defences. Additionally, wrist shots allow more trickery and deception to confuse the goalie. Players are able to set up surprising angles with how they pull the shot. Slapshots tend to be straighter and have to get into the goal via pure power and speed, which are better prepared for in modern hockey. The one-timer still sees use by letting the person taking the slapshot set up before they even have the puck, thus avoiding the slow wind-up time that gives the defence a chance to react.

==Speed records==
A puck can reach the speeds of or more when struck. A slapshot is the traditional way to set up such powerful shots.

The KHL record for fastest shot is held by Alexander Riazantsev, who slapped a puck at the KHL All-Star Game&#x27;s Skill competition in Riga, Latvia, with a speed of 114.127 mph (183.67 km/h) on January 21, 2012.

The NHL record for fastest shot is held by Zdeno Chara, whose shot was measured at 108.8 mph (175.5 km/h) during the NHL All-Star Game&#x27;s Skills Competition in Ottawa, Canada, on January 29, 2012. 

The AHL record for fastest slapshot is held by Martin Frk, with a shot clocked at 109.2 mph (175.7 km/h) during the AHL All-Star Game&#x27;s Skills Competition in Ontario, California, USA, on January 26, 2020.

NHL/AHL and KHL slapshot speed records are not directly comparable to each other, as the official regulations for the hardest shot vastly differs between the leagues.

<text>Joseph Wilfred Camille &quot;The Eel&quot; Henry (January 31, 1933 – September 11, 1997) was a Canadian professional Canadian ice hockey left winger/centre who played for the New York Rangers, the Chicago Black Hawks and the St. Louis Blues in the National Hockey League.

==Playing career==
Born in Quebec City, Henry, nicknamed &#x27;The Eel&#x27; played in the Quebec Junior Hockey League with the Quebec Citadelles during his junior career. Henry led the league in goals in 1951-52 with 52 goals and in 1952-53 with 46 goals. He also led the league in point scoring in 1951-52 with 114 points and was selected to the QJHL First All-Star Team in 1951-52 and in 1952-53. Henry also made an appearance in the 1953 Memorial Cup playoffs posting 21 points in 8 games.

Henry made his National Hockey League debut with the New York Rangers in 1953-54. He had his greatest success wearing number 21 for the New York Rangers. At 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) and 150 lb (68 kg), he was the smallest man in the NHL at the time and suffered numerous injuries throughout his career. He was known for his ability to swat the puck out of mid air to score goals. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the National Hockey League rookie of the year beating out Jean Béliveau of the Montreal Canadiens. After playing 21 games with the Rangers the following season, Henry was traded to the Providence Reds of the American Hockey League. He was then loaned to the Quebec Aces in the Quebec Hockey League. Henry would return with the Reds in 1955-56, and he led the AHL in goals with 50. Henry would also lead the Reds to a Calder Cup championship and in the process, he scored 10 goals in 9 games to lead all players in playoff scoring.

In 1956-57, Henry returned to the Rangers. He split his time with the Rangers and the Reds that season, before playing for 7 straight seasons with only the Rangers. Camille was selected as an NHL Second All-Star Team left winger in 1957-58, the year he also won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for best sportsmanship combined with production. In 1964-65, he was named Captain of the New York Rangers. He also played in the 1958, 1963 and 1964 NHL All-Star Games. In 1964-65, Henry was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks for Paul Shmyr. Henry played 22 games with the Black Hawks posting 8 points. During that season, Henry also made his first ever trip to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Black Hawks ended up losing in 7 games to the Montreal Canadiens.

He would return to New York in 1967–68, where he would split his time with the Buffalo Bisons in the AHL. Henry was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1968-69 where he went to the Stanley Cup finals in 1969. He would play 2 seasons with the Blues before retiring.

==Notable appearances==

On November 1, 1959 when Jacques Plante first wore a mask for protection in a game, Camille was the only player to score on him in that game.

On December 12, 1963 Camille participated in an NHL record when the Montreal Canadiens and the New York Rangers combined for the fastest three goals by two teams in NHL history. Dave Balon and Gilles Tremblay scored for Montreal and Camille Henry scored for the Rangers, all within 18 seconds. The record stood until Feb. 10, 1983.

Camille scored the first ever hat trick for the St. Louis Blues.

==Post-playing career==
Henry coached the Kansas City Blues of the Central Hockey League in 1969-70 and then coached the New York Raiders of the World Hockey Association but he never duplicated his early success. He coached the New Jersey Rockets semi-pro hockey club that played at Ice World in Totowa, NJ in the mid/late 1970s. Henry eventually ran the twin rinks in Totowa, New Jersey, and Branchbrook Park in Newark.

Henry was married and divorced from Dominique Michel, famed Quebec chanteuse and comedienne. After his retirement Henry lived in Quebec City and held security jobs, eventually becoming essentially destitute. He was widely considered to have an alcohol consumption problem which was complicated by diabetes. He died shortly after receiving his first reimbursement for the players&#x27; pension fund which was awarded by the courts.

<text>A shot in ice hockey is an attempt by a player to score a goal by striking or snapping the puck with their stick in the direction of the net.

== Statistical definition ==
A shot on goal is a scoring attempt. A count of how many shots are taken by a team is kept and this is often used as rough guide to which team is being more aggressive and dominant. A scoring attempt in hockey (as opposed to soccer) is officially counted as a shot only when it is directed on goal, resulting in a goal or requiring the goaltender to make a save. The numbers of shots and saves in a game are especially relevant to goaltenders, whose save percentage is based on how many shots did not get past them. The number of shots taken by skaters and the percentage on which they score is also measured, but these numbers are generally given less weight. Some shots on goal are considered more likely to result in a goal and are called scoring chances.

==Types==
There are five basic types of shots in ice hockey.

===Shovel===
The shovel shot (also referred to as a flip shot) is the simplest and most basic shot in a shooter&#x27;s arsenal. Its execution is simply a shoveling motion to push the puck in the desired direction, or a flick of the puck (be it on the forehand, backhand, or in a spearing motion). Players typically resort to shoveling the puck to push loose pucks past a sprawling, or out-of-position goaltender.

===Wrist===
The wrist shot is executed by positioning the puck toward the heel-middle of the blade. From that position the shooter rolls their back wrist quickly, while thrusting the puck forward with the bottom hand. As the blade propels the puck forward the movement of the wrist rolls the puck toward the end of the blade, causing the puck to spin. The tightness of the spin of the puck has an effect much like the spin a quarterback puts on their football pass, resulting in more accuracy. The puck is aimed with the follow-through of the shot, and will typically fly perfectly in the direction of the extension of the stick, resulting in an extremely accurate shot. At the same time, the stick flexes, so the moment the puck is released from the stick, the snap of the stick will propel the puck forward at high speeds. Current and former NHL players known for their wrist-shot include Joe Sakic, Alexander Ovechkin, Ilya Kovalchuk, Connor McDavid, Marián Gáborík, Jeff Carter, Evgeni Malkin, Jack Eichel, Teemu Selänne, Alexei Kovalev, Pavel Datsyuk, Phil Kessel, Wayne Gretzky, Steven Stamkos, Nikita Kucherov, Peter Forsberg, Artemi Panarin, Markus Näslund, Nathan MacKinnon and Vladimir Tarasenko.

===Snap===
The snap shot is a combination of both the slapshot and the wrist shot. The shooter begins by cocking the stick back like a slapshot (usually less far), and finishes with a flicking of the wrist like a wrist shot. The resulting shot has more speed than a wrist shot, while increasing the time it takes to release the shot, balancing its effectiveness. Current and former players noted for their snap-shot include Joe Sakic, Ilya Kovalchuk, Phil Kessel, Thomas Vanek, Nathan Horton, Anže Kopitar, Vincent Lecavalier, Alexander Ovechkin, Mike Bossy, Evgeni Malkin, Connor McDavid and Dany Heatley. Many consider Joe Sakic to be the father of the modern snapshot, as he demonstrated incredible scoring ability while utilizing this quick-release shot throughout his career. He much preferred it to the wrist shot, which he was less known for. During his career, Phil Kessel has perfected a variation of the snap shot where the player transfers their weight to their &quot;puck foot&quot;, or &quot;back foot&quot;, and shoot in stride. He has used this to become one of the NHL&#x27;s most dangerous shooters.

===Slap===
The slapshot is the hardest, yet most telegraphed, shot. The player draws their stick back away from the puck, then forcefully brings it forward to strike the ice two to seven inches behind the puck. This causes energy to be stored in the stick as it flexes against the ice. When the stick finally contacts the puck, the energy stored in the stick is transferred to the puck, providing additional force that would not otherwise be possible by hitting the puck directly. The height and positioning of the follow-through determines the trajectory of the puck. Current and former NHL players known for their slapshot include Bernard &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Geoffrion, Al MacInnis, Zdeno Chára, Daniel Alfredsson, Ilya Kovalchuk, Dustin Byfuglien, Alexander Ovechkin, Shea Weber, Sami Salo, Mario Lemieux, Guy Lafleur, Christian Ehrhoff, Brian Rolston, Evgeni Malkin, Sheldon Souray, P. K. Subban, Nikita Kucherov, Steven Stamkos, Al Iafrate, Ray Bourque, Bernie Federko and Jason Garrison.

===Backhand===
The backhand shot is a wrist shot released from the back of the blade, and on the player&#x27;s backhand. This shot is not as powerful or accurate as any of the other shots, but often comes unexpectedly. They are primarily taken close to the goal, most commonly on breakaways. Slapshots can also be backhanded. Players known for their backhanders include Jyrki Lumme, Joe Sakic, Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Marián Hossa, Milan Hejduk, Patrick Marleau, Mike Richards, Mats Sundin, Pavel Datsyuk, Paul Stastny, Henrik Zetterberg, Derek Roy, Claude Giroux and Daniel Brière.

===Other===

====One-timer====
The one-timer can be any of the above shots, when fired in a continuous motion that the other player One player passes the puck to another, and while the pass is incoming the player chooses not to stop the puck, instead firing it as it reaches the shooter. This is the lowest accuracy shot, but makes up for it in the difficulty it creates for a goaltender to properly position himself to defend against it. Due to the elasticity of the rubber (albeit frozen) puck, it can also generate significantly more energy, giving it more speed and faster elevation. When executed as a slapshot (also called a one-time-slapshot) and finding its way into the goal, it is often known as a &quot;goal-scorers goal&quot; due to the difficulty of the timing and placement of the shot. Current and NHL players known for their one-timers include Leon Draisaitl, Steven Stamkos, Alexander Ovechkin, Ilya Kovalchuk, Nikita Kucherov, Brent Burns, Shea Weber, Brett Hull, P. K. Subban, Evgeni Malkin, Artemi Panarin and Patrik Laine.

====Deke====
A deke, short for &quot;decoy&quot;, is a feint, a shot, or both, intended to confound a defender. Many players, such as Connor McDavid, Pavel Datsyuk, Mario Lemieux, Wayne Gretzky, Evgeni Malkin, Bobby Orr, Gilbert Perreault, Bobby Ryan, Alexei Kovalev, John Tavares, Rick Nash, Artemi Panarin, Denis Savard, Jaromír Jágr, Joe Sakic, Nikita Kucherov, Pavel Bure, Mikael Granlund, Johnny Gaudreau and Patrick Kane have picked up the skill of &quot;dangling&quot;, which is more fancy deking and requires more stick handling skills.

====Michigan====
The Michigan, otherwise known as a Lacrosse style goal or the Zorro, can be considered as a special type of deke. It involves a player flipping the puck on the blade of the stick and then whipping the puck while carrying it on the blade. The shot is rarely witnessed due to its requirement for refined stickhandling skills and vulnerabilities for defensive maneuvers. Advantages of this shot are an element of surprise and capacity to position the puck accurately into the top corner from odd angles. Consequently, the Michigan shot is usually attempted from behind the net by surprising a goaltender from a blindside while using the net as a cover from defense. The shot was first used in 1996 NCAA Tournament by a Michigan player Mike Legg, though the invention of the maneuver has been credited to Bill Armstrong. The Michigan has grown in popularity, and began to be attempted by NHL players in the mid-to-late 2010&#x27;s. The shot has been attempted by players such as Sidney Crosby, Mikael Granlund, Ryan Getzlaf, Tyler Ennis, Miks Indrašis, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Viktor Arvidsson, Claude Giroux, Patrik Laine, Auston Matthews and Trevor Zegras. The first and second successful Michigan goals in the NHL were both by Andrei Svechnikov. Filip Forsberg, Kent Johnson, Trevor Zegras, and Connor Bedard (as a rookie) have also been successful with Michigan attempts.

====Tip====
Tipping the puck involves positioning oneself in the vicinity of the net and redirecting an incoming shot with, generally, the blade of the stick. The shaft of the stick and even body parts (legs, posterior, chest, back, even head and face) may also alter the trajectory of the puck and result in a valid goal, although scoring this way generally involves as much chance as deliberate effort. Tips careening off an offensive player&#x27;s skate will count if no deliberate kicking motion was made. At close distance a well-directed tip that maintains some modicum of speed will pass by the goalie and into the net without the keeper having any possibility to react to the change in direction. Tipping the puck is a very common way to score a goal in today&#x27;s NHL, and all teams use it frequently.

==Handedness==
A player&#x27;s handedness is determined by which side of their body they hold their stick. A player who shoots left (alternatively called a &quot;left-handed shot&quot;) holds the stick such that the blade is (normally) to the left of their body, with the left hand on the bottom and the right hand on top; a player who shoots right (a &quot;right-handed shot&quot;) holds the stick such that the blade is to their right, with the right hand at the bottom and left hand on top. The bottom hand delivers most of the power while the top hand is responsible for control and stickhandling, as well as the &quot;whip&quot; of shots. Of the 852 players who skated in the 2007–08 NHL regular season, 554 of 852 (65%) shoot left. Many natural right handed players shoot left and vice versa. This is because, if someone is naturally right handed, they may shoot left, as the top hand (right hand on a lefty stick) controls most of the stick&#x27;s action.

<text>Howard Earl Bailey Jr. (born March 9, 1980), known professionally as Chingy, is an American rapper from St. Louis, Missouri. He toured as an opening act with fellow St. Louis rapper Nelly in 2002, and signed with Georgia-based rapper Ludacris&#x27; record label, Disturbing tha Peace (DTP), that same year. Released in a joint-venture with Capitol Records, his 2003 debut single, &quot;Right Thurr&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The song preceded the release of his debut studio album &quot;Jackpot&quot; (2003), which, despite mixed critical reception, peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. His second album, &quot;Powerballin&#x27;&quot; (2004), peaked at number ten on the chart, while his third album, &quot;Hoodstar&quot; (2006), peaked at number nine and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top ten single, &quot;Pullin&#x27; Me Back&quot; (featuring Tyrese Gibson). His fourth album, &quot;Hate It or Love It&quot; (2007), saw a commercial decline and was preceded by the single &quot;Fly Like Me&quot; (featuring Amerie). His fifth album, &quot;Success &amp; Failure&quot; (2010), failed to chart.

== Early life ==
Chingy grew up in Walnut Park, St. Louis; he has referred to the neighborhood as the &quot;Bad Blocks.&quot;

He began writing lyrics when he was 9 and was recording raps at 10. He was originally known as H Thugz and was in the St. Louis group Without Warning on 49 Productions with M.G.D. &amp; Mysphit. They recorded &quot;What&#x27;s Poppin Off&quot; together, which became a local hit. H Thugz and Augustin also recorded a music video for the song. H Thugz later chose the alias Chingy, a slang term for money.

Chingy attended McCluer North High School in Florissant, Missouri which is a suburb of St. Louis. During high school, he was known to his friends as &quot;Howie,&quot; and he continues to prefer that name from close friends and family.

== Career ==
=== 2002: Early career ===
Ludacris and his manager, Chaka Zulu, were quick to sign Chingy to their fledgling Disturbing Tha Peace label.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Jackpot&quot; and &quot;Powerballin&quot; ===
Chingy&#x27;s debut album &quot;Jackpot&quot; was released on July 15, 2003, on Disturbing tha Peace. Unable to secure a distribution deal through Def Jam, Ludacris negotiated a deal to distribute the album through Capitol Records. Guest appearances included Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Murphy Lee, I-20, Raindrop, Tity Boi of Playaz Circle, Trina, and Jermaine Dupri. Fueled by &quot;Right Thurr&quot;, &quot;Jackpot&quot; produced the hit &quot;One Call Away&quot; featuring J-Weav and &quot;Holidae In&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg and Ludacris. The album was produced by St. Louis production crew The Trak Starz. The album was received well by critics. Within a year of the release of &quot;Jackpot&quot;, It was certified Platinum by the RIAA. The up-tempo Southern hip hop track &quot;Right Thurr&quot; gained popularity, peaking at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Chingy released his second album, &quot;Powerballin&#x27;&quot;, on November 16, 2004, through Slot-A-Lot Records and Capitol Records. The album peaked at #10 on the charts and featured the hit single &quot;Balla Baby.&quot; The album featured guest appearances from artists R. Kelly, Bun B, Lil Wayne, Lil Flip, Janet Jackson, David Banner, Nate Dogg, and Get It Boyz. &quot;Powerballin&quot;&#x27; sold over one million copies and received a Platinum certification by the RIAA on March 21, 2005. He also was on one of the George Lopez episodes as himself. The eighth song from his album &quot;I Do&quot; is featured on the soundtrack for the smash hit 2004 video game Need for Speed: Underground 2.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Hood Star&quot; and &quot;Hate It or Love It&quot; ===
&quot;Hoodstar&quot; is Chingy&#x27;s third album, released on September 19, 2006. The album featured Mr. Collipark, longtime collaborator Jermaine Dupri, Timbaland, and Mannie Fresh. His summer single, &quot;Pullin Me Back&quot; (featuring actor-R&amp;B singer Tyrese), would find him back on top on the Hot Rap Tracks chart and help &quot;Hoodstar&quot; debut at number eight on the album chart, but the follow-up single &quot;Dem Jeans&quot;, featuring Jermaine Dupri, fared worse although the album did go gold. Other singles from &quot;Hoodstar&quot; were &quot;Brand New Kicks&quot; and &quot;Hands Up&quot;.

Unhappy with the way he felt Capitol was promoting their urban artists, in 2007 Chingy jumped ship and returned to DTP Records, which was by-then a part of the Def Jam family. When asked about the move, the St. Louis rapper said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think Capitol really knew how to work urban artists, They&#x27;re really stuck on pop and they didn&#x27;t know how to market me.&quot;

&quot;Hate It or Love It&quot; is Chingy&#x27;s fourth studio album. The album featured production from Scott Storch, Timbaland, and Cool and Dre. The lead single is &quot;Fly Like Me&quot;, featuring Amerie. The album was released on December 18, 2007, and featured appearances by Ludacris, Bobby Valentino, Steph Jones, Trey Songz, Rick Ross, and Anthony Hamilton. The album debuted at #84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 30,000 copies, making it Chingy&#x27;s first album not to crack the Top 10. &quot;Hate It or Love It&quot; was not released in the UK, marking Chingy&#x27;s first album not to be released in the country.

=== 2009–2012: &quot;No Risk, No Reward&quot; ===
In 2012 Chingy announced he was working on his fifth studio album called &quot;No Risk No Reward&quot;, DTP which was set to be released sometime in 2012, but as of June 2016 continues to be delayed due to lack of funding. &quot;Superhero&quot;, featuring Full Dekk Music Group&#x27;s artist Chris Woodhouse, was purported to be the first single from the album. Chingy then announced that he would be releasing a mixtape, &quot;Jackpot Back&quot;, which was released March 3, 2012.

=== 2013–2016: &quot;King Judah&quot; and &quot;Watch the World&quot; ===
In Spring 2013, Chingy announced that he had become a practicing Black Hebrew Israelite and released the music video for &quot;King Judah&quot;. It was Chingy&#x27;s attempt to follow a moral agenda and denounce mainstream rap. Currently Chingy is working on his upcoming EP album entitled &quot;Chingology&quot; which was released later this year.

Major media outlets in Australia and NZ leaked information about a new Chingy collaboration, &quot;Watch The World&quot;, featuring New Zealand based Asian model/singer Lucy X (Lucy Xu) . The track produced by ChristopherKris (Kris Lal) is rumored to be featured on an upcoming compilation album released in 2014. The single was released on November 1, 2013, to iTunes and radio. The song reached #2 on the iTunes Urban chart in both countries, with a video to follow in the coming months.

=== 2017–present: Signing to Bungalo Records ===
Chingy signed to Universal Music Group distributed label Bungalo Records; it was his third time recording under the Universal umbrella. In 2019, Chingy will participate in the &quot;Millenium Tour&quot; with B2K.

In 2021, Chingy headlined a tour of the United States with R&amp;B singers Mýa and Ginuwine.

=== Other ventures ===
==== Acting career ====
In 2005, Chingy made his acting debut in the TV comedy series &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;. In the same year, Chingy acted in the TV comedies &quot;One on One&quot; and &quot;George Lopez&quot;. In 2006, Chingy made a cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Scary Movie 4&quot;, as well as on TV series &quot;Yo Momma&quot;. In 2010, Chingy had a role in the film &quot;Speed-Dating&quot;.

==== Cologne ====
In early 2022, he announced that his first cologne was being manufactured and packaged. He appeared on the online platform TalkShopLive in September 2022 to promote and officially sell the cologne for the first time.

==Controversy==
=== Feud with Nelly ===
Despite opening for Nelly in 2002, Chingy had initially expressed discontent with the lack of promotion on the tour. Meanwhile, reports persisted that Nelly was increasingly irritated with Chingy&#x27;s growth in fame particularly when he signed with Ludacris&#x27; DTP label shortly following the tour. Nelly claims he felt disrespected by Chingy&#x27;s actions, claiming in a 2005 interview; &quot;For him to say that &#x27;Nelly and all them didn&#x27;t take no part in him getting a deal&#x27;, is like saying &#x27;Run-DMC and them didn&#x27;t take any part on me getting a deal&#x27;, everybody that comes out tries to help the next motherfucker&quot;. Nelly subsequently dropped a verse on the song &quot;Another One&quot; on his 2004 album Sweat with a line in the song saying, &quot;I like the way you do that right thurr [there]/You just remember why you do that right thurr, I made it tight to be country/They thought country was bummy/Till country start making money&quot; which was perceived by Chingy as a diss track, though an interview with Nelly in December 2004 in which he believed the lyrics were taken out of context, later claiming: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going at him. If you listen to the song, it says, &#x27;I like the way you do that right thurr.&#x27; I could have said, &#x27;Fuck the way you do that right thurr!&#x27; It ain&#x27;t even like that.&quot; Angered by the song, Chingy leaked a song in response taking aim at Nelly entitled &quot;We Got&quot; on January 7, 2005. Later on in December 2005 at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas, Chingy alleges he approached Nelly to end the feud but claims he refused to discuss in private but was ignored repeatedly. However; months later Chingy would approach Nelly&#x27;s cousin who allowed both rappers to put an end to the feud in 2006. During an interview in November 2022; Chingy would also claim Nelly&#x27;s sister had also approached him at an airport, diligent for both to resolve the feud prior to her death due to cancer complications in March 2005, claiming &quot;At that point, she said she had a wish, and that wish was for me and him to come together... When I heard that, I had to end this; for her. This can&#x27;t go on. She had a wish for this to happen, she really wanted me and her brother to be cool.&quot;

<doc id="568129" wikidata="Q3538052" url="?curid=568129" title="Neutral zone trap">
<text>The neutral zone trap (often referred to as simply the trap) is a defensive strategy used in ice hockey to prevent an opposing team from proceeding through the neutral zone (the area between the blue lines) and to force turnovers.

== Description ==
The most recognizable implementation of the trap sees the defense stationing four of their players in the neutral zone and one forechecker in the offensive zone. As the offensive team starts to move up the ice, the forechecker (generally the center) will cut off passing lanes to other offensive players by staying in the middle of the ice, forcing the puck carrier to either sideboard. The defensive wingers—typically placed on or near the red line—will be positioned by the boards to challenge the puck carrier, prevent passing, or even keep opponents from moving through. The two defencemen who are positioned on or near the blue lines are the last defence, and must stall the opposition long enough for the wingers to reset themselves and continue the trap.

== History ==
The modern neutral zone trap is best associated in the National Hockey League with the New Jersey Devils, starting in the mid-1990s. The strategy was controversial, where it was criticized for contributing to low scoring and unexciting games. ESPN analyst Mike Milbury said it should be banned.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, serious discussion about opening the game to offense was held between the NHL and NHL Players Association (NHLPA). Because it is easier to trap when engaging in obstruction and restraining fouls, such as hooking and holding, which slow the progress of faster players who can evade the trapping team, the NHL ordered officials to call every obstruction penalty, regardless of circumstance. The prohibition on two-line passes from behind a team&#x27;s blue line to the other side of the red line was also lifted. Long passes are one method for breaking out of the trap, as it avoids the need to navigate through defenders in the neutral zone, although it has high rates of turnovers.

The NHL also implemented a “Goalkeeper’s Restricted Area” (&quot;Martin Brodeur&quot; Rule), a trapezoidal area behind the net outside of which goalies cannot play the puck if they are behind the goal line. This allows offenses to more effectively dump the puck past the trap into the corners. Defensive minded teams have reverted to a &quot;third man high&quot; 1–3–1 system where only two offensive players will commit down low, allowing the third to join the defense and impede progress across the blue line. The rule was created to reduce the effectiveness of goaltenders that handle the puck well, such as New Jersey Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, for whom the rule that created the trapezoid is nicknamed for.

<doc id="568130" wikidata="Q1010175" url="?curid=568130" title="Erskine, Renfrewshire">
<text>Erskine (, , ) is a town in the council area of Renfrewshire, and historic county of the same name, situated in the West Central Lowlands of Scotland. It lies on the southern bank of the River Clyde, providing the lowest crossing to the north bank of the river at the Erskine Bridge, connecting the town to Old Kilpatrick in West Dunbartonshire. Erskine is a commuter town at the western extent of the Greater Glasgow conurbation, bordering Bishopton to the west and Renfrew, Inchinnan, Paisley and Glasgow Airport to the south. Originally a small village settlement, the town has expanded since the 1960s as the site of development as an overspill town, boosting the population to over 15,000. In 2014, it was rated one of the most attractive postcode areas to live in Scotland.

==History==

Archaeological evidence states that agricultural activity took place within the area as far back as 3000 BC and it has been inhabited by humans since 1000 BC. The first recorded mention of Erskine is at the confirmation of the church of Erskine in 1207 by Florentius, Bishop of Glasgow. The land around the town was first part of the estate of Henry de Erskine in the 13th century. Sir John Hamilton of Orbiston held the estate in the 17th century until 1703 when it was acquired by the Lords Blantyre. By 1782 there were twelve houses and a church in Erskine. A new church was then built which is still in use today. An influx of workmen moved to the area during 1836-41 due to the construction of the Inverclyde railway line. In 1900 it passed into the ownership of William Arthur Baird, who inherited it from his grandfather, Charles Stuart, 12th Lord Blantyre.

In the late 18th century, the town of Erskine was a hamlet. During this time, stone quays were constructed to support the Erskine Ferry to Old Kilpatrick and Dunbartonshire. This replaced the river ford which had been in place since medieval times. In light of increased industry and infrastructure in the surrounding area, it gradually became a village in the following century. The small church community grew to having 3,000 residents in 1961, when Renfrewshire County Council unveiled its &quot;New Community&quot; plan for the town&#x27;s development which involved the Scottish Special Housing Association.

The development began in 1971 with the building of both privately owned and rented accommodation which boosted the town&#x27;s population by around 10,000. Having established itself as a thriving commuter town, the 1990s saw the building of larger and more expensive housing, aimed at more affluent property buyers. Due to apprehension about further expansion of the town, several proposals for further large housing developments have been rejected. This is largely because the town has only one secondary school.

==Geography==
The town expanded in the 1970s with the construction of housing association stock. Since that decade, considerable private housing developments have continued. As more private houses were built in the 1980s, Erskine started to become an attractive place to live due to location factors and accessibility to main roads and the M8 Motorway. Due to this there was a major boom in property development in the 80s and 90s. Most ex-and existing housing association stock are found in the Bargarran, North Barr and Park Mains areas of the town. Private housing is mostly found in the west part of the town, e.g. Garnieland, Flures Drive, Hawthorn, Parkvale, Parkinch, St. Annes, West Freelands.

The town borders a number of nearby settlements, some separated by a rural hinterland.

==Economy==

The town&#x27;s Bridgewater complex provides a range of tertiary sector businesses, chiefly retail and leisure facilities. These include supermarkets, a tanning salon, a dental surgery, a bakery, a butcher, a fish &amp; chip shop, takeouts, a pub with dining area, a Chinese restaurant, an optician, a chemist, a doctors surgery, hardware store, a hair salon, an estate agency, a dry-cleaners and key cutting service, a swimming pool, a funeral directors, a bank and a public library. There are also smaller retail areas in the Bargarran, Mains Drive and Park Glade areas, where there are a few shops and restaurants as well as a community centre.

On the riverside, there is an office block which is home to a logistic company. The Erskine Bridge Hotel is also situated on the banks of the Clyde. A few hundred yards up river is the Pandamonium Play Centre. There are 2 private golf clubs in Erskine. The Erskine Golf Club, which is located on the border between Erskine and Bishopton. And also the Mar Hall Hotel and Golf Course which is less than away.

In addition to a number of local playing fields, the area has two other relatively new sporting facilities: the Erskine Community Sports Centre and the Astroturf at Park Mains High School.

==Landmarks==
===Erskine Bridge===
The Erskine Bridge towers high over the western limit of the town. The bridge is the furthest west crossing point on the river and it soon expands to become the Firth of Clyde estuary.

===Erskine House===

Erskine House was constructed between 1828 and 1845. It was designed by Sir Robert Smirke, the architect of the British Museum. During the First World War it became the Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers. It is now the 5-star Mar Hall Hotel, recalling the estate&#x27;s former ownership by the Earl of Mar.

===Erskine Hospital===

The town is home to the Erskine Hospital, a facility that provides long-term care for veterans of the British Armed Forces and their Spouses, with a drop-in day centre and newly built Transitional Supported Accommodation for younger veterans at the Veterans Village near Bishopton. The charity opened as &quot;Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers&quot; in 1916 due to the urgent need to treat the thousands of military personnel that lost their limbs in the First World War. It has gone on to offer help to British ex-service people from all wars since World War One. It has grown to become one of the biggest ex-services facility in Scotland.

The charity has two units within the Erskine area and also specialist units in Glasgow and Edinburgh. The charity has strong links with the British Royal Family. Prince Charles is the charity&#x27;s patron. He opened the flagship unit called &quot;Erskine Home&quot; in 2000. Princess Anne has also opened various units for the charity.

The charity host various fundraising events throughout the year. They host an annual motorbike meet, a Military themed ball, Christmas fayre and various concerts. The charity accept the help of volunteers from the public and needs to raise £10 million annually to run its services.

In February 2021, drug and alcohol addiction clinic Abbeycare Scotland relocated to the 34 bed unit in Meadows Drive no longer used by the Erskine charity.

===Boden Boo===

There is a woodland area beneath the Erskine bridge with about of informal trails, picnic areas and views of the River Clyde. The area is ideal for walking and cycling. The Erskine Beach is also situated here. Forestry and Land Scotland is responsible for the area.

===Bodinbo Island===
This is one of seven or more islands that once stood in River Clyde. Bodinbo Island was a hazard to navigation but was cut off from the main river by a training dike in the mid 19th century.

===Rashielee Quay and quarries===
Much of the whinstone used to build the retaining walls, jetties, quays, etc. in the lower Clyde area came from the Rashielee Quarries and was transported via Rashielee Quay. The area has now been landscaped however parts of the quarries are still present however the quay has been infilled.

===Park or Fulton&#x27;s Quay===

Usually known as Park Quay this disused private quay and jetty stands close to the site of the old Park House estate. It was probably built in between 1789 and 1801 by the Fultons who made their fortune manufacturing silk in Paisley and one of the owners was W.T.Lithgow of the shipbuilding firm. The quay seems to have been last used in the mid 20th century.

===Newshot Island===

Newshot Island Nature Reserve, a salt marsh which juts out into the River Clyde, is located in Erskine. Contrary to its name, it is now a peninsula, created from silt left over from the widening and deepening of the river in the 1930s, which connected the island to Erskine. The nature reserve acts as a feeding and resting point for a wide array of migratory birds traveling to and from regions such as North America, Siberia and West Africa.

==Transport==
Erskine is served by Glasgow Airport, which is located 4 km south of the town.

Old Greenock Road connects Erskine to the M8 motorway, the Erskine Bridge and Bishopton. The last tip at the northern side of the A726 road also connects to the Erskine Bridge which then connects onto the M898 motorway providing links for onward travel. The A726 road mentioned earlier cuts through the centre of Erskine and is also the primary road for traveling into Paisley. Erskine is serviced by McGill&#x27;s Bus Services and previously Arriva Scotland West. Buses operate to Glasgow, Paisley, Renfrew, Inchinnan,Clydebank, Glasgow Airport and Bishopton.

There are also Plans to connect Erskine to Glasgow with a heavy metro line as part of the proposed Clyde Metro Project.

==Education==

The town&#x27;s secondary school is called Park Mains High School. It is the largest school in Renfrewshire and one of the biggest in Scotland with up to 1,400 students. It is a non-denominational state school. For Roman Catholic denomination state education, the town falls within the catchment area of Trinity High School in nearby Renfrew. Erskine has five primary schools. All are state schools, with Rashielea, Bargarran and Barsail providing non-denominational education and St John Bosco and St Anne&#x27;s providing Roman Catholic denomination education.

<doc id="568133" wikidata="Q842989" url="?curid=568133" title="Sulfur dye">
<text>Sulfur dyes are the most commonly used dyes manufactured for cotton in terms of volume. They are inexpensive, generally have good wash-fastness, and are easy to apply. Sulfur dyes are predominantly black, brown, and dark blue. Red sulfur dyes are unknown, although a pink or lighter scarlet color is available.

==Organic Chemistry ==
Sulfur linkages are the integral part of chromophore in sulfur dyes. They are organosulfur compounds consisting of sulfide (–S–), disulfide (–S–S–) and polysulfide (–Sn–) links in heterocyclic rings. They feature thiazoles, thiazone, thianthrene, and phenothiazonethioanthrone subunits.
Being nonionic, sulfur dyes are insoluble in water.

===Process===
Dyeing includes a few stages, viz. reduction, dyeing, washing, oxidation, soaping, and final washing.
The anion is developed on reducing and solubilising at boil when it shows affinity for cellulose.
Sodium sulfide (Na2S), the reducing and solubilising agent, performs both reduction and solubilisation, producing thiols and then to sodium salt of thiols or thiolates, which are soluble in water and substantive towards cellulose.
Higher rate of exhaustion occurs at 90-95 °C in presence of electrolyte.
Dyed cellulosics exhibit a tendering effect on storage under humid atmosphere due to presence of excess free sulfur. Aftertreatment with sodium acetate is required to suppress that.
H2S liberated during dyeing forms corrosive metal sulfide. This restricts use of metal vessels except those made of stainless steel:
:Fe + H2S → FeS + H2

==Production, past and present==
The forerunner of sulfur dyes said to be &quot;Cachou de Laval&quot;, which was discovered by Groissant and Bretonniere in 1873 and is prepared by treating products with lignin (like sawdust or straw) with sulfide sources (like sodium hydroxide or sulphide mixed with sulphur). Subsequently, Henri-Raymond Vidal invented so-called Vidal Blacks in 1893 by reactions of various aniline derivatives with sulfur. These experiments demonstrated that deeply colored materials could be readily produced by combining aromatic compounds and sulfur sources.

The most important member of the class is Sulfur Black 1. It is produced by the reaction of 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium sulfide in hot water. Like many sulfur dyes, details on the chemical reactions are poorly understood. It is accepted that the sulfide reduces the nitro groups to aniline derivatives, which are thought to form indophenol-containing intermediates that are further crosslinked by reaction with sulfur. The result are insoluble, high molecular weight species. Sulfur Black 1 is imperfectly understood, and the material is probably heterogeneous. It is speculated to be a polymer consisting of thianthrene and phenothiazine subunits. The so-called sulfur bake dyes are produced from 1,4-diaminobenzene and diaminotoluene derivatives. These dyes are proposed to consist of polymers with benzothiazole subunits. Members of the sulfur bake dyes class are Sulfur Orange 1, Sulfur Brown 21, and Sulfur Green 12.
==Application method==
Sulfur dyes are water-insoluble. In the presence of a reducing agent and at alkaline pH at elevated temperature of around 80 °C, the dye particles disintegrate, which then become water-soluble and hence can be absorbed by the fabric. Sodium sulfide or sodium hydrosulfide are suitable reducing agents. Common salt facilitates the absorption. After the fabric is removed from the dye solution, it is allowed to stand in air whereupon the dye is regenerated by oxidation. The regenerated parent dye is insoluble in water. Oxidation can also be effected in air or by hydrogen peroxide or sodium bromate in a mildly acidic solution.

The low water solubility is the basis of the good wash-fastness of these dyed fabrics. These dyes have good all-around colour fastness except to chlorine bleaches. Because the dye is water-insoluble, it will not bleed when washed in water and will not stain other clothes. The dye, however, may have poor fastness to rubbing. The dyes are bleached by hypochlorite bleach.

==Environmental issues==
Due to the highly polluting nature of the dye-bath effluent, sulfur dyes are being slowly phased out in the West but they are used on a large scale in China. Recent advances in dyeing technologies have allowed the substitution of toxic sulfide reducing agents. Glucose in basic solution is now used and both low-sulfide and zero-sulfide products are available. Future developments in the field of reducing dye levels by means of electrochemical processes are promising.

<doc id="568139" wikidata="Q4951569" url="?curid=568139" title="Samhain (box set)">
<text>The self-titled box set of American deathrock band Samhain was released in 2000, more than 13 years after the band effectively ceased recording and performing. The set&#x27;s five CDs and one VHS tape compile nearly all of the band&#x27;s original catalog, newly remastered from the original master tapes, as well as previously unreleased material, the latter of which includes a live CD and a VHS video cassette of live footage.

Of Samhain&#x27;s previous official releases, only the original mix of the &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; EP was not included in the boxed set; conjecture is that the original master tapes had been lost over the years, or were erased when Danzig re-recorded the guitar and some vocal tracks to those songs in June 1987 for eventual release as side B of the original &quot;Final Descent&quot;.

== Special packaging ==
The outer box cover was painted by Martin Emond, who had previously provided artwork for singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s post-Samhain band, Danzig, and comic book company Verotik. Within the box, each of the five CDs came in its own &quot;mini-LP&quot; sleeve (unlike the jewel-cases used for the individual CD reissues the following year). Also included was a 32-page booklet of photographs and reprinted lyrics to Discs One and Three.

The boxed set was advertised as &quot;a $75 value, all for just $59.95&quot;, and is now out of print. If pre-ordered online through distributor E-Magine Music&#x27;s website, the first pressing of the boxed set was shipped two weeks prior to the street date, with the first 1,000 packaged with an &quot;internet exclusive&quot; bonus metal pin of the &quot;scarecrow beast&quot; character that appeared on Samhain T-shirts in the 1980s (similar to the one on the cover of the &quot;November-Coming-Fire&quot; album).

Second pressings of the boxed set omitted the bonus pin, but included &quot;the previously unreleased Samhain comic book&quot; by &quot;Mr. Monster&quot; creator Michael T. Gilbert (with four uncredited pages by Sean Wyett, who also illustrated Danzig for the back cover of the Misfits&#x27; &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot;). The &quot;contents&quot; listing on the back of the box was modified to reflect the comic&#x27;s inclusion. Some boxed sets were reportedly shipped with both the bonus metal pin and the comic.

== Track listing ==




* Tracks 1–10: Live February 19, 1985, at Danceteria, New York, NY
* Tracks 11–18: Live April 13, 1986, at the Cabaret Metro, Chicago, IL

* Tracks 1–8 recorded April 13, 1985, at Typographer&#x27;s Hall, Baltimore, MD
* Tracks 9–13 recorded April 13, 1986, at the Cabaret Metro, Chicago, IL
* Tracks 14–16 recorded July 14, 1986, at The Ritz, New York, NY

== Notes ==
* Disc two marks the first time the remixed &quot;Unholy Passion&quot; EP was presented as a single CD on its own, though the contents had been added to the first CD pressing of &quot;Initium&quot; in 1987, and again to the original &quot;Final Descent&quot; in 1990. The original mix of the EP has never been released on CD, apart from unofficial/illegal bootlegs which are sourced from vinyl and cassette.
* Eerie Von has confirmed that &quot;Death... in Its Arms&quot; was recorded during the sessions for Danzig&#x27;s second album, &quot;Danzig II: Lucifuge&quot;, and features the full original Danzig lineup: Glenn Danzig, Eerie Von, John Christ, and Chuck Biscuits.
* The title of &quot;Death... in Its Arms&quot; is misspelled on all releases (with an incorrect apostrophe in &quot;it&#x27;s&quot;).
* &quot;Lords of the Left Hand (2nd Version)&quot; was actually recorded in September 1986, while the &quot;original version&quot; was not recorded until September 1987, and was not mixed in its final form until 1990.
* Tracks 4 and 5 of &quot;Samhain III: November-Coming-Fire&quot; are incorrectly reversed on the CD sleeve. The correct order is listed above.
* Tracks 7 and 9 of &quot;Final Descent&quot; are incorrectly reversed on the CD sleeve. The correct order is listed above.

<doc id="568143" wikidata="Q189440" url="?curid=568143" title="All Japan Kendo Federation">
<text>The is the governing body for Kendo in Japan, overseeing its development, competitions, and regulations across the country. Founded in 1952 and officially formed on March 14, 1954, it is a member of the International Kendo Federation and plays a central role in promoting and standardizing Kendo, Jōdō, and Iaido.

The AJKF is responsible for organizing national tournaments, conducting grading examinations, fostering traditional values, and overseeing the coordination of regional federations across Japan&#x27;s 47 prefectures.

== History ==
The AJKF was founded in the aftermath of World War II, during which kendo was banned by the Allied Occupation forces due to its association with militarism.

The AJKF was officially formed on March 14, 1954. Its primary mission is to promote and standardize kendo, iaido, and jodo across Japan. In 1970, the AJKF played a central role in founding the International Kendo Federation (FIK), aiming to foster global interest and standardization in these martial arts. Over the decades, the AJKF has been instrumental in organizing national tournaments, establishing grading systems, and preserving the traditional values associated with these disciplines. Today, it continues to be a central authority in the martial arts community, both within Japan and internationally.

Kendo itself has a long history, evolving from the samurai&#x27;s swordsmanship (&quot;kenjutsu&quot;) during Japan&#x27;s feudal periods. The development of protective gear (&quot;bōgu&quot;) and bamboo swords (&quot;shinai&quot;) in the Edo period (1603–1868) laid the foundation for modern kendo, transforming it from a combat technique to a discipline focused on personal growth and character building.
==Championships==
The All Japan Kendo Federation organizes various competitions and events, including:

* All Japan Kendo Championship (全日本剣道選手権大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Kendō Senshuken Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Women&#x27;s Kendo Championship (全日本女子剣道選手権大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Joshi Kendō Senshuken Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Iaido Taikai (全日本居合道大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Iaidō Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Jodo Taikai (全日本杖道大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Jōdō Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Kendo 8-dan Tournament (全日本選抜剣道八段優勝大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Senbatsu Kendō Hachidan Yūshō Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Tōzai-Taikō (East vs. West Japan) Kendo Tournament (全日本東西対抗剣道大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Tōzai-Taikō Kendō Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Interprefecture Kendo Championship (全日本都道府県対抗剣道優勝大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Todōfuken Taikō Kendō Yūshō Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Kendo Enbu Taikai (全日本剣道演武大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Kendō Enbu Taikai&quot;), commonly known as the Kyoto Taikai (京都大会, &quot;Kyōto Taikai&quot;)
* All Japan Boys and Girls Martial Arts (Kendo) Training Tournament (全日本少年少女武道（剣道）錬成大会, &quot;Zen Nihon Shōnen Shōjobudō (Kendō) Rensei Taikai&quot;)

The All Japan Kendo Championship is considered the most important Kendo competition in the world, even more prestigious than the World Kendo Championships.

The All Japan Kendo Enbu Taikai is the oldest, most traditional, and most prestigious Kendo event in both Japan and the world.

In addition to the above competitions and events, which cater to a select group of practitioners (such as professional athletes or high-ranking practitioners), the AJKF also organizes open events for all practitioners without any distinction. One such event is the Kendo Godo Keiko-kai for all (剣道合同稽古会 全国対象, &quot;Kendō gōdō keiko-kai zenkoku taishō&quot;), where all kenshi are invited to participate free of charge.

<doc id="568149" wikidata="Q2955988" url="?curid=568149" title="Hockey jersey">
<text>A hockey jersey is a piece of clothing worn by ice hockey players to cover the upper part of their bodies. They also are worn by fans to show support for a team, or to create ties to a hometown or region. 

&quot;Hockey sweater&quot; is a term originating from the sport&#x27;s earlier days when it was predominantly played outside during winter and when the sweaters worn by players were warm, wool-knit coverings. This term has fallen out of common usage since the switch to polyester.

== Design ==

Hockey jerseys today are typically made of tough synthetic materials like polyester, to help take away moisture and keep the wearer dry. Most professional ice hockey teams sell replica sweaters of their famous players at sports memorabilia stores, as well as being available at arenas.

For most leagues around the world, in accordance with the team&#x27;s colours and matching the socks, they are usually emblazoned with the team&#x27;s logo on the front, the player&#x27;s last name on the upper back, and a designated number below, from 0 to 99. A team captain wears an uppercase &quot;C&quot; above and to the right of the team logo on their sweaters (although a few NHL teams have the letter above and to the left). Two other players, designated alternate captains, wear an uppercase &quot;A&quot; on theirs.

Hockey jerseys are often more complicated than football or baseball jerseys, due the front crest being a major feature rather than player numbers. Due to this the NHL requires an 18 month notice from any team looking to change their jerseys.

Sweaters worn in European leagues and tournaments are adorned with sponsor advertisements, a concept borrowed from football jerseys. The NHL first allowed ads on jerseys in the 2022-23 season.

===Alternate jerseys===
Many hockey leagues across the globe also have an additional third or alternate jersey, like the NHL. These jerseys usually have a special design as the crest and are sometimes part of a special event or leaguewide initiative, such as the Winter Classic or Stadium Series. However, many other leagues have different alternate jerseys for many different things. For example, the Sioux Falls Stampede in the USHL rebrand to the &quot;Sioux Falls Fighting Wiener Dogs&quot; for a night and wear a special jersey with a group of dachshunds stampeding forwards, although they changed the logo to a dachshund holding a hockey stick.

NHL teams also have special nights where they recognize a significant cultural group or event where they will have special jerseys worn in warmups to show their appreciation. Leaguewide events like Pride night will have special LGBTQIA+ designs on the jersey and players can opt to have rainbow stick tape to show support in addition to the jersey worn during warmups. However, each team has their own nights for special events.

===Exceptions===

The design is often adapted for specific cases, such as former NHL Vancouver Canucks teammates Henrik and Daniel Sedin. Their last names are accompanied by their first initials, since being twin brothers they share the same last name on the same roster. Similarly, Aku and Aatu Räty wear jerseys with two letters from their first names when playing for the same team to distinguish them. During an exhibition match between the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers, defenseman Ethan Bear, who is of Cree descent, wore a jersey with his last name on it written in Cree syllabics.

The National Hockey League no longer permits 0 nor 00 for jersey numbers, as they cannot be entered into the NHL&#x27;s database, and the available numbers only go up to 98 since the League retired the number 99 in honor of Wayne Gretzky.

== Cultural impact ==
===Fashion and media===
The cultural impact of the hockey sweater in Canada is encapsulated by the short story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot; by Roch Carrier. In it, a young hockey fan asks his mother to order a Montreal Canadiens sweater from an Eatons department store catalogue, but instead accidentally receives a sweater for the team&#x27;s arch-rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, much to his embarrassment and the derision from his friends. The story was later made into a short animated film of the same name, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada; a quote from it appears on the 2003 Canadian five-dollar bill.

In Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off the character Cameron played by Alan Ruck wears a Detroit Red Wings Gordie Howe jersey. Ruck said this was to give the character more depth and independence that wasn’t shown directly in the movie.

Hockey jerseys started to become more popular as a fashion choice with the general public starting with the expansion of teams like the San Jose Sharks and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to southern California. As well as Wayne Gretzky being traded to the Los Angeles Kings around the same time.

Jerseys started to be made with fashion in mind first at this time, with the NHL’s first alternate jersey program starting in 1995. For example, the first alternate of the Edmonton Oilers introduced was meant to be worn by fans of the team and fans of fashion alike, and to speak to skater culture. While pulling from team history for inspiration, it featured completely new elements such as bold new logos and the introduction of silver to the team.

Starting in the early 2010&#x27;s tossing a jersey onto the ice has become an extreme way of vocalizing displeasure with a team. This is seen mostly in Canada. It is done to show the fan is &quot;giving up.&quot; The practice is mostly frowned upon, being seen as attention seeking. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and their arena have banned and fined fans for throwing jerseys onto the ice.

With the rise in popularity, counterfeit jerseys have become an issue for fans, collectors, and retailers. Consumers and the NHL are upset over the sales due to poor quality and a feeling of being taken advantage of, as some counterfeits can be close to the same price as authentics. Many news organizations have done segments to inform fans of signs of fakes, such as improper stitching, thinner materials, and missing holographic tags. Over 1 million fake jerseys were sold online per year in a 2011 estimate by MarkMonitor. This number was estimated to be four times what it was at the NHL 08-09 season. The Montreal Canadiens have been hit hardest, with their team store having sales dropped by a third during this time. The NHL has attempted to crack down on the selling of the fake jerseys, by teaming up with the NBA and MLB they had shut down over 1000 websites selling fake sports items.

===Hip-hop and music culture===
In the mid 1990&#x27;s hockey jerseys became popular in Hip-Hop culture. The first major appearance is from Snoop Dogg in his Gin and Juice music video. In it he is seen wearing a Pittsburgh Penguins jersey with &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; and the number 94 on the back. In other scenes in the music video he is wearing Springfield Indians jersey. In an interview with the Athletic, when asked why he chose to wear them, Snoop Dogg responded &quot;I always thought that the hockey jerseys were fashionable and a good fit. No one in rap was really reppin them.&quot;

Hockey Jerseys also appeared in multiple other music videos during this time from artists such as Nas in &quot;The World is Yours&quot;, A Tribe Called Quest in &quot;Oh My God&quot;, LL Cool J in &quot;Hey Lover&quot;, and Smif-N-Wessun in &quot;BuckTown&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s get it on.&quot; Tupac Shakur was seen wearing a Detroit Red Wings jersey in an infamous photo and video of him spitting at reporters while appearing to court.

In the late 2010’s there was a revival of the trend, with artists such as Drake and Post Malone wearing jerseys of local teams when performing tours. Artist SZA being from St. Louis has featured St. Louis Blues jerseys in many of her works, such as the cover of her grammy winning album S.O.S. and in a music video appearance for her feature on “Rich Baby Daddy”

The NHL has tried to capitalize on the revival of the trend, seen most with artist Justin Bieber and his Drew House brand collaborating with Adidas in 2022 to create the Toronto Maple Leafs “Flipside jersey.” The outside being a black Toronto jersey with blue accents and the Toronto skyline in silhouette on the sleeve. The jersey also has a feature when reversed inside-out being black with gold accents, and features a combination of the yellow Drew House smile logo, and the Leafs front crest. This collaboration would resume in 2024 when the NHL revealed Drew House inspired jerseys for the 2024 NHL All-Star game.

<doc id="568153" wikidata="Q816463" url="?curid=568153" title="Ben Cohen (businessman)">
<text>Bennett Cohen (born March 18, 1951) is an American businessman, activist and philanthropist. He is a co-founder of the ice cream company Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s.

==Early life==
Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in the town of Merrick, New York, on Long Island by Jewish parents Frances and Irving. He spent at least one summer at Buck&#x27;s Rock Performing and Creative Arts Camp in New Milford, Connecticut. Cohen first met and befriended his future business partner Jerry Greenfield in a seventh grade gym class in 1963. They continued on to Sanford H. Calhoun High School. In his senior year, Cohen found work as an ice cream man before leaving for university studies. He studied at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York; Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, where he mostly took pottery classes; New York University in New York, New York; and at the University Without Walls program of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Over the next decade, Cohen pursued his interest in pottery and dropped out of college after his sophomore year.

==Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s==

In 1977, Cohen decided to go into business with his old friend Jerry Greenfield, and in May of the next year, the two men opened Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Homemade Ice Cream Parlor in Burlington, Vermont. They initially intended to start a bagel business, but found the equipment costs prohibitive and switched to ice cream instead. They chose Burlington as a location because it was a prominent college town which, at the time, had no ice cream shop. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s distinctive style of ice cream was developed to compensate for Cohen&#x27;s anosmia, as he kept adding larger and larger chunks to the ice cream to satisfy his need for texture in food.
Cohen resigned as chief executive officer of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s in 1996.

== Other business ventures ==
In March 2023, it was reported Cohen started Ben&#x27;s Best Blnz, or B3, a non-profit firm that offered cannabis products like low-THC pre-rolls and full-spectrum vapes. The stated objective of this effort was to correct for the wrongs of the War on Drugs and to narrow the racial wealth gap. Proceeds from sales would be split among three entities, with 10% going to the Last Prisoner Project, 10% going to the Vermont Racial Justice Alliance, and the remaining 80% going to NuProject.

==Political activism==

As Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s gradually grew into a nationwide business and one of the largest ice cream companies in the U.S., Cohen turned his new-found wealth and prominence toward a variety of political causes, generally through the Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Foundation. The Foundation receives 7.5% of all Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s pre-tax profits and distributes funds to organizations such as the Anti Displacement Project. Cohen also oversaw TrueMajority and Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities.

He is a vocal supporter of Democratic candidates and progressive causes. He supported Dennis Kucinich in the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In 2008, he initially supported John Edwards followed by Barack Obama.

In 2012, he helped launch the Stamp Stampede campaign to stamp messages on the nation&#x27;s currency in support of passing a constitutional amendment to help overturn &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; and reduce the influence of private corporations on politics.

On April 18, 2016, Cohen was arrested, with Jerry Greenfield, while at a Democracy Awakening protest in Washington, D.C.

In July 2021, Cohen and Greenfield announced their support for the company&#x27;s decision to end sales of Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s products in the occupied Palestinian territories. In an opinion piece in the &quot;New York Times&quot; they wrote &quot;it’s possible to support Israel and oppose some of its policies&quot;.

On October 10, 2021, Ben and Jerry were interviewed by Alexi McCammond of Axios on HBO. McCammond asked Ben about his political views regarding stopping the sales of ice cream in Israel. Ben was subsequently asked why Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s ice cream was sold in Georgia and Texas in response to Georgia&#x27;s voter identification law and the 2021 Texas Heartbeat Act, which restricts abortions after 6 weeks. Ben replied by stating &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; and &quot;By that reasoning, we should not sell ice cream anywhere.&quot;

In 2022 Cohen funded the Pierre Sprey Award for journalism. The inaugural awardees included Sam Husseini, Aaron Maté, Benjamin Abelow, and Sudarsan Raghavan.

In 2023 Cohen faced criticism over his opposition to U.S. weapons deliveries to Ukraine in its war against Russia, with some calling for boycotts against Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s. Cohen said: “The U.S. could use its power to advocate for a negotiated settlement, but instead it’s using its power to prolong the war — prolong and prolong and increase the death and destruction”.

Cohen is a top donor to the People&#x27;s Power Initiative and Eisenhower Media Network, organizations that have argued against U.S. military and financial assistance to Ukraine. Speakers for the Eisenhower Media Network have been accused by the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; of echoing Russian talking points on Ukraine, including blaming NATO expansion for the outbreak of the conflict. Cohen told the &quot;Daily Beast&quot; that &quot;the U.S. should use its power to negotiate an end to the war, not prolong the death and destruction by supplying more weapons&quot;.

In 2022, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s parent company, Unilever, criticized a tweet from Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s Twitter account blaming U.S. President Joe Biden for contributing to rising tensions with Russia and distanced itself from Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s position on Ukraine.

Cohen was arrested in July 2023 during a protest against the U.S. government&#x27;s prosecution of WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange.

In March 2024, Cohen was one of several signatories of &quot;A Statement From Jewish Americans Opposing AIPAC&quot;, a letter denouncing AIPAC&#x27;s lobbying efforts in the United States government.

=== Bernie Sanders presidential campaigns===
Cohen became a prominent supporter of and donor to Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

Cohen debuted a special ice cream flavor called &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Yearning&quot; on January 25, 2016, in support of Sanders. The flavor, released under the brand Ben&#x27;s Best, consisted of plain mint ice cream covered by a solid layer of mint chocolate. According to Cohen, &quot;The chocolate disk represents the huge majority of economic gains that have gone to the top 1 percent since the end of the recession. Beneath it, the rest of us.&quot; This was done in an effort to showcase the United States&#x27; current socioeconomic issues. The ice cream was made by hand in Cohen&#x27;s kitchen with ingredients purchased by the Sanders campaign. Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s released a statement disavowing connection or support for the product, saying &quot;This was created by Ben as a citizen. The company is not involved.”

On February 21, 2019, Cohen was named a national co-chair of Bernie Sanders&#x27; 2020 campaign. In August 2019, Cohen produced another Bernie Sanders flavor called &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Back.&quot; It was not for sale in stores, but was awarded as a prize to 40 contest winners.

<doc id="568164" wikidata="Q1785680" url="?curid=568164" title="Goaltender mask">
<text>A goaltender mask, commonly referred to as a goalie mask, is a mask worn by goaltenders in a variety of sports to protect the head and face from injury from the ball or puck, as they constantly face incoming shots on goal. Some sports requiring their use include ice hockey, lacrosse, inline hockey, field hockey, rink hockey, ringette, bandy, rinkball, broomball, and floorball. This article deals chiefly with the goal masks used in ice hockey.

In ice hockey it is sometimes simply referred to as a hockey mask. In some cases the facemask must meet safety specifications designed for use in a specific sport such as ringette. Some recent changes have also occurred in bandy though not without controversy. This article deals chiefly with masks designed for ice hockey goaltenders.

Jacques Plante was the first ice hockey goaltender to create and use a practical mask in 1959. Plante&#x27;s mask was a piece of fiberglass that was contoured to his face. This mask later evolved into a helmet-cage combination, and single piece full fiberglass mask. Today, the full fiberglass mask with the birdcage facial protector (known as a &quot;combo mask&quot;) is the more popular option, because it is safer and offers better visibility.

Since the invention of the fiberglass ice hockey mask, professional goaltenders no longer play without a mask, considering it is now a mandatory piece of equipment. The last goaltender to play without a mask was Andy Brown, who played his last NHL game in 1974. He later moved to the Indianapolis Racers of the World Hockey Association and played without a mask until his retirement in 1977.

== History ==

The first recorded case of an ice hockey goaltender using a mask was in February 1927 where a metal fencing mask was donned by Queen&#x27;s University netminder Elizabeth Graham, mainly to protect her teeth.

In 1930, the first crude leather model of the mask (actually an American football &quot;nose-guard&quot;) was worn by Clint Benedict to protect his broken nose. After recovering from the injury, he abandoned the mask, never wearing one again in his career.

At the 1936 Winter Olympics, Japanese ice hockey goaltender Teiji Honma wore a crude mask, similar to the one worn by baseball catchers. The mask was made of leather, and had a wire cage that protected the face, as well as Honma&#x27;s large circular glasses.

===Jacques Plante===
It was not until 1959 that a goaltender wore a mask full-time. On November 1, 1959, in the first period of a game between the Montreal Canadiens and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) at Madison Square Garden, Canadiens goaltender Jacques Plante was struck in the face by a shot from Andy Bathgate. Plante had previously worn his mask in practice, but head coach Toe Blake refused to allow him to wear it in a game, fearing it would inhibit his vision. After being stitched up, Plante gave Blake an ultimatum, refusing to go back out onto the ice without the mask, to which Blake obliged, not wanting to forfeit the game, since NHL teams did not have back-up goaltenders at the time. Montreal won the game and continued on an 18-game unbeaten streak, which went through November.

In preparation for the playoffs, Plante was asked by Blake to remove it for a game on March 8, a 3–0 loss. Plante donned the mask the next night, and for the remainder of his career. When he introduced the mask into the NHL, many questioned his dedication and bravery; in response, Plante made an analogy to a person, which he described as skydiving without a parachute, which he considered a gesture of stupidity rather than bravery. Although Plante faced some laughter, the face-hugging fiberglass goaltender mask soon became the standard; by late 1969, only a few NHL goaltenders went without one.

== Types ==
=== Face-hugging ===

The face-hugging fiberglass, the type which was worn first by Jacques Plante, is a longtime symbol of ice hockey as typified by the famous painting &quot;At the Crease&quot;, by Ken Danby. The goaltender mask evolved further from the original face-hugging fiberglass mask designed by Plante. Although this mask does not seem very protective now, at the time it was, based on the style of game that was played. 

Gerry Cheevers&#x27;s use of the face-hugging mask for the Boston Bruins was among the first to be &quot;decorated&quot; in a custom manner; as prompted by then-Bruins trainer John &quot;Frosty&quot; Forristall as a joke, painting a fake stitch on the mask where Cheevers had been struck by an errant puck. Cheevers adopted the &quot;stitch mask&quot; as his own, and went on to set an NHL record (which still stands) of 32-straight wins during the Bruins&#x27; 1971–72 season.

While this style of mask is no longer used by hockey leagues, it has remained famous because of its use in popular culture. Perhaps the best-known example is the character Jason Voorhees from the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; horror film franchise. Casey Jones from the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; franchise also wears a stylized version of the mask, as did D-Roc the Executioner, the late guitarist of the heavy metal band Body Count. Similarly, the members of Hollywood Undead are always seen wearing signature masks based on this design. In the film &quot;Heat&quot;, the protagonists wear face-hugging hockey masks as part of their disguise during a heist, as do the characters in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;, during a mission which is heavily inspired by the heist from the film.

=== Helmet-cage (&quot;bird cage&quot;) combination ===

In the 1970s, a helmet-cage combination was popularized by Vladislav Tretiak. He was particularly notable for wearing it during the 1972 Summit Series, which exposed the &quot;bird-cage&quot; style mask to Canadian hockey fans and players. Like the original fiberglass design, the helmet-cage combination has been criticized for not providing adequate facial/cranial protection. Dan Cloutier switched from this type of mask to the more popular full fiberglass citing safety reasons upon the advice of the Los Angeles Kings. Dominik Hašek used this type of mask. Rick DiPietro, last with the New York Islanders in 2013, was one of the last NHL goaltenders to use this type of mask. Following Clint Malarchuk&#x27;s life-threatening injury in 1989, more goaltender masks have adopted a plastic extension to guard the neck, usually hanging loose for more maneuverability. On March 4, 2014, Tim Thomas took the ice for the Florida Panthers wearing an old Cooper helmet painted dark blue with a modern Bauer cage and white Itech neck guard attached. During the game, the cage broke from a slapshot and Thomas returned with a red Mage-style helmet with a similar Bauer cage. Goaltenders at lower levels of hockey (such as high-school, college or recreational leagues) who choose to use this design cite reasons such as the plastic helmet used is lighter than the fiberglass or composite materials used in other designs, and that the helmet has a wider opening than a traditional mask for a less claustrophobic feeling and better sight of the puck.

=== Fiberglass/cage combination (Combo mask) ===
In the late 1970s, a second type of goaltender mask consisting of a fiberglass mask with a wire cage covering a cut-out area in the middle of it was developed by Dave Dryden and Greg Harrison. The fiberglass portion can also be made out of carbon fiber, or a fiberglass and kevlar mix. Gilles Meloche and Chico Resch were among the first NHL adopters of the combo mask, in the early 1980s. More modern versions of this type of mask are designed to better withstand the impact of a hockey puck at higher speeds, and are used at all levels of organized ice hockey. This type of mask is considered safer than the other types, since it disperses the impact of the puck better than the helmet-cage combination, and is the most common type used by goaltenders today. Former goaltender Tim Thomas of the Boston Bruins wore a newer style one piece called a Sportmask Mage RS, which is made like the newer fiberglass mask, but resembles the helmet/cage combination. The combo mask was approved for Canadian minor hockey in 1989. Amateur versions have only square or rectangular openings between the bars, as the cats-eye bars are banned in minor hockey.

===Cats-eye bars===

Brian Heaton, designer of the Cooper Canada HM30 cage and HM40 for forward players, inspired the basis for all cats-eye bars, ( &quot;cateye&quot; cages) in use by goaltenders today.

Cats-eye bars are banned in all minor hockey governed by Hockey Canada, unless they feature additional bars to reduce the size of the openings.

== Tactical play ==

The advent of the goaltender mask changed the way goaltenders play, allowing them to make more saves on their knees without fear of serious head or facial injuries. Before the advent of the mask, most goaltenders stayed standing as much as possible. In the modern era, a goaltender is likely to suffer temporary discomfort instead of serious concussions and lacerations; however, a mask does not eliminate all potential risk of injury, and goaltenders have been concussed by a shot hitting the head. Some goaltenders, such as Dominik Hašek and Henrik Lundqvist, have used their heads intentionally to stop shots. Lundqvist said that his reason for this is to not obstruct his vision by placing his catching glove in front of his mask to stop the shot.

== Mask decoration ==

With available surface area provided by fiberglass masks, goaltenders find it fashionable to give their mask distinctive decorations. This tradition started with the earliest masks, notably by the aforementioned, now-retired Boston Bruins goaltender Gerry Cheevers, who was known for drawing stitches on his mask whenever it got hit. These stitches represented where Cheevers would have been cut had he not been wearing his mask. Modern-day masks also offer this ability, and goaltenders are well-identified with their helmet design, often transferring the motif into their new team&#x27;s colours when traded or signed to a new team (for example, Patrick Lalime&#x27;s Marvin the Martian theme, Félix Potvin&#x27;s cat theme, Curtis Joseph&#x27;s Cujo theme, Ed Belfour&#x27;s eagle theme, Martin Brodeur&#x27;s Devils theme, Peter Budaj&#x27;s Ned Flanders theme, Cam Talbot&#x27;s Ghostbusters theme or John Gibson&#x27;s Arcade game theme).

== Other uses ==
=== Other sports ===

In recent years, baseball catchers have begun wearing facemasks similar in style to goaltender masks. Charlie O&#x27;Brien was the first to use a hockey-style catcher&#x27;s mask in a Major League Baseball game in 1996 while playing for the Toronto Blue Jays.

Goaltender masks are commonly seen being worn by box lacrosse, ringette, rinkball, floorball and field hockey goaltenders at both youth and professional levels.

<text>Duncan Bowen Black (born February 18, 1972), better known by his pseudonym Atrios , is an American liberal blogger living in Philadelphia. His weblog is called &quot;Eschaton&quot;. Black was also a regular guest economics expert on Air America Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Majority Report&quot; and is currently a regular commentator on Sam Seder&#x27;s internet radio (Majority.fm) Majority Report and an op-ed contributor to &quot;USA Today&quot;.

== Biography ==

After obtaining his BA from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Black obtained a PhD in economics from Brown University in 1999. He has worked at the London School of Economics, the Université catholique de Louvain, the University of California, Irvine, and, most recently, Bryn Mawr College. He is now a Senior Fellow at the media research group Media Matters for America.

Black began his online political life in Salon magazine&#x27;s &quot;Tabletalk&quot; messageboards under the pseudonym of Kurt Foster, then began blogging as &quot;Atrios&quot;, remaining pseudonymous for several years, and even joking that he was actually a high school gym teacher. According to Black, the name &quot;Atrios&quot; is actually a (misspelled) reference to a character named Antrios in the Yasmina Reza play &quot;&#x27;Art&#x27;&quot; who paints the play&#x27;s key &quot;white painting on white canvas&quot;.

Before starting Eschaton, Black wrote (as Atrios) for the webzine Media Whores Online (now defunct). During the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, he revealed that he had accepted a job at Media Matters for America and allowed his name and photograph to be published. He later said that as an academic he blogged pseudonymously to avoid attacks like those later unleashed on Timothy Shortell. Atrios&#x27; blogging has been characterized as encouraging discourse and public deliberation.

== Eschaton ==

Black&#x27;s weblog &quot;Eschaton&quot; generally features short entries on a variety of topics ranging from policy commentary to breaking news and links. Posts are frequent — on the order of ten every day. The majority of posts are authored by Black (as &quot;Atrios&quot;), but there are occasional guest bloggers. On June 29, 2005, Black described &quot;Eschaton&quot; as not a blog but an &quot;Online Magazine of News, Commentary, and Editorial.&quot; Following a similar announcement from &quot;The Talent Show&quot;, this was a satirical reaction to Federal Election Commission hearings on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Black had previously expressed frustration that the FEC might not apply the act&#x27;s &quot;media exemption&quot; to blogs, which he regarded as equivalent to other forms of media including online magazines.

== Appearance in fiction ==

Atrios (portrayed by an uncredited actor) appeared briefly in the 7th season &quot;West Wing&quot; episode &quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot; (Episode 7x15) meeting with the fictional Democratic presidential candidate Matt Santos. Atrios was introduced by Josh Lyman (played by Bradley Whitford) as having &quot;raised 300 grand online&quot; and having &quot;almost as many readers as The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;.

== Language ==
Duncan Black is credited with creating the neologism &quot;Friedman Unit&quot; to refer to &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist Tom Friedman&#x27;s predilection for repeatedly using the next six months as the critical time period for the Iraq War and the term &quot;High Broderism&quot; for an approach to politics characterized by &quot;the worship of bipartisanship for its own sake&quot; as a cover for &quot;the defense of...&#x27;the establishment&#x27; at all costs&quot;.

<doc id="568175" wikidata="Q2499551" url="?curid=568175" title="Hockey helmet">
<text>A hockey helmet is worn by players of ice hockey, inline hockey, and bandy to help protect the head from potential injury when hit by the puck, sticks, skates, boards, other players, or the ice. The shell of a hockey helmet is generally made of a substance called vinyl nitrile that disperses force from the point of contact, while the liner may be made of either vinyl nitrile foam, expanded polypropylene foam, or other material to absorb the energy, to reduce the chances of concussion. Hockey helmets grip the head from inside by cupping the back of head, or the occipital protuberance. Helmet manufacturers will have a chart that relates their helmet sizes to head measurements. On older models, the helmet size is adjusted by loosening the screws on the side to slide the front portion forward or back.

==Visors and shields==
A visor or face shield in ice hockey is a device attached to the front of a helmet to reduce potential of injury to the face. Visors cover the upper half of the face, while full face shields cover the entire face. A series of eye injuries, most notably that to Greg Neeld (the first player to wear a visor in professional hockey) and Bryan Berard have led to a call from many to enforce their wearing. , 94% of NHL players wear visors. Many other leagues around the world mandate the use of visors. Visors and shields, made of a high impact-resistant plastic, offer better overall vision than the wire cages available, which can obscure vision in certain areas. The face shield provides excellent straight ahead and peripheral vision, but does not provide as good air flow as a cage.

The American Hockey League, the top minor league in North America required all players to wear a visor prior to the start of the 2006–07 season. The NHL &quot;strongly recommends&quot; the use of visors. In 2013, the NHL began requiring all players with fewer than 25 games of experience to wear visors.

The hockey visor was first invented by Kenneth William Clay when he lost vision in his left eye to a high stick while playing for the Vanderhoof Bears. After a month in hospital in Vancouver, Clay created the first documented clear face shield in January 1964. The invention caused quite a stir, with announcers calling it a &quot;fish bowl&quot; and a &quot;wrap-around windshield&quot;. While the original shield and helmet were lost in the fire that consumed the Vanderhoof Arena a few years later, the newspaper clippings still attest to the dates and facts.

== Full facial protection ==

A cage in ice hockey is a device attached to the front of a helmet to reduce potential of injury to the face. It consists of a metal or composite mesh that covers the entire face, although some half cages do exist (to protect the eyes while allowing full airflow). The bars, or cage, are spaced far enough apart to allow seeing through to the action but are close enough to stop pucks and sticks from getting through to injure the face. A hybrid variation of the full-face shield, which uses a polycarbonate face shield on the top half and either a polycarbonate or metal cage on its bottom half is also available.

Full facial protection is mandatory in many amateur leagues and in North America, full face cages, full shields, or shield and cage combination are mandatory in high school hockey, college hockey, and for all players under the age of 18.

In 2002, the &quot;British Journal of Sports Medicine&quot; published a study identifying the protection offered against concussions between the half-face shield and the full-face shield. The use of a full-face shield compared with half-face shield significantly reduced the playing time lost because of concussion, suggesting that concussion severity may be reduced by the use of a full-face shield.

== Helmet developers ==
Canadian ophthalmologist Tom Pashby spent 46 years improving the safety of helmets to prevent injuries. He served as president of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) for two decades, which resulted in standards being set for helmets, rules enacted for wearing protections, and rules for safer play.

NHL player George Parsons was forced to retire due to career-ending eye injury in 1939. He became involved with CCM, helping to develop helmets and facial protection that would be safer for players. The hockey visor was first invented by Kenneth William Clay when he lost vision in his left eye to a high stick while playing for the Vanderhoof Bears. After a month in hospital in Vancouver, Clay created the first documented clear face shield in January 1964. The invention caused quite a stir, with announcers calling it a &quot;fish bowl&quot; and a &quot;wrap-around windshield&quot;. While the original shield and helmet were lost in the fire that consumed the Vanderhoof Arena a few years later, the newspaper clippings still attest to the dates and facts. By early 1976, CCM had developed a hockey helmet complete with eye and face shield and lower face protector that was both approved by the CSA and endorsed by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association.

==Helmets in the National Hockey League==

The first player to regularly wear a helmet for protective purposes was George Owen, who played for the Boston Bruins in 1928–29. In 1927, Barney Stanley presented a prototype of a helmet at the NHL&#x27;s annual meeting. It was quickly rejected.

Helmets appeared after the Ace Bailey–Eddie Shore incident on December 12, 1933, as a result of which Bailey almost died and Shore suffered a severe head injury. After that, Art Ross engineered a new helmet design and when the Boston Bruins took to the ice in a game against the Ottawa Senators, most of the players donned the new helmet. Most Bruins players didn&#x27;t wear the helmet after the game, with the exception of Eddie Shore, who wore it the rest of his career. In the 1930s, the Toronto Maple Leafs players were ordered to add helmets to their equipment. A few minutes into the first game with the new helmets, the popular King Clancy famously flung his off. The helmets were generally unpopular with fans, media, and other players. A few players, such as Des Smith, Bill Mosienko, Dit Clapper, and Don Gallinger continued to don helmets.

During the Original Six era, Maurice Richard and Elmer Lach briefly wore helmets. Jack Crawford wore a helmet to hide his bald head and Charlie Burns wore one to protect the metal plates in his head from an injury incurred in playing junior ice hockey, predating his NHL career.

The death of Bill Masterton from a brain injury in a January 13, 1968, game between the Minnesota North Stars and Oakland Seals started to change perceptions surrounding helmets. Helmet use began to gradually increase during the 1970s, with Ted Green being the first Bruins player since Shore to wear one. He began in the 1970–71 NHL season and continued until his retirement from pro hockey in 1979. The 1972 Summit Series showcased an entirely helmet clad Soviet Union team, with Paul Henderson, Stan Mikita, and Red Berenson being the only Canadians to sport a helmet. Usage increased to the point that 70% of NHL players were wearing them by 1979.

In August 1979, the then-President of the National Hockey League (NHL), John Ziegler, announced that protective helmets would become mandatory for incoming players in the NHL. &quot;The introduction of the helmet rule will be an additional safety factor,&quot; he said. The rule allowed players who signed professional contracts prior to June 1, 1979, who were already not wearing helmets to continue to do so for the rest of their careers provided a liability waiver was signed, if they so desired. 

Nearly a decade later, in 1988, the NHL also made helmets mandatory for its officials; like the ruling for players, any official that was not wearing a helmet before the ruling could also go helmetless if he so desired. 

With the new rulings in place, the last player to play without a helmet was Craig MacTavish, who played his final game during the 1996–97 season for the St. Louis Blues. 

Following the players, the last referee to call a game without wearing a helmet was Mick McGeough, who began wearing a helmet during the 2006–07 season, just before he retired at the end of the 2007–08 season.

<doc id="568188" wikidata="Q1728804" url="?curid=568188" title="National Volunteers">
<text>The National Volunteers was the name taken by the majority of the Irish Volunteers that sided with Irish Parliamentary Party leader John Redmond after the movement split over the question of the Volunteers&#x27; role in World War I.

==Origins==
The National Volunteers were the product of the Irish political crisis over the implementation of Home Rule in 1912–14. The Third Home Rule Bill had been proposed in 1912 (and was subsequently passed in 1914) under the British Liberal government, after a campaign by John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party. However, its implementation was delayed in the face of mass resistance by Irish Unionists. This had begun with the introduction of the bill into Parliament, when thousands of unionists signed the &quot;Ulster Covenant&quot;, pledging to resist Home Rule. In 1913 they formed the Ulster Volunteers (UVF), an armed wing of Ulster Unionism and organised locally by the Orange Order; the Ulster Volunteers stated that they would resist Home Rule by force.

In response, Nationalists formed their own paramilitary group, the Irish Volunteers, at a meeting held in Dublin on 25 November 1913; the purpose of this new organisation was to safeguard the granting and implementation of Home Rule. It looked for several months in 1914 as if civil war was imminent between the two armed factions, with the British Army known to be reluctant to intervene against Ulster armed opposition to Home Rule&#x27;s coming into operation. While Redmond took no role in the creation of the Irish Volunteers, when he saw how influential they had become he realised an independent body of such magnitude was a threat to his authority as leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and therefore sought control of the organisation.

Eoin MacNeill, along with Sir Roger Casement and other leaders of the Irish Volunteers, had indeed sought Redmond&#x27;s approval of and input in the organisation, but did not want to hand control over to him. In June 1914, the Volunteer leadership reluctantly agreed, in the interest of harmony, to permit Redmond to nominate half of the membership of the Volunteer Executive; as some of the standing members were already Redmondites, this would make his supporters a majority of the Volunteers&#x27; leadership. The motion was bitterly opposed by the radical members of the committee (mostly members of the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood), notably Patrick Pearse, Seán Mac Diarmada, and Éamonn Ceannt, but was carried nevertheless to prevent a split. With the support of the Irish Party the Volunteer organisation grew dramatically.

==Great War split==
Following the outbreak of World War I in August, and the successful placement of the Home Rule Act on the statute books (albeit with its implementation formally postponed), Redmond made a speech in Woodenbridge, County Wicklow on 20 September, in which he called for members of the Volunteers to enlist in an intended Irish Army Corps of Kitchener&#x27;s New British Army. He pledged his support to the Allied cause, saying in his address:
&quot;The interests of Ireland — of the whole of Ireland — are at stake in this war. This war is undertaken in the defence of the highest principles of religion and morality and right, and it would be a disgrace for ever to our country and a reproach to her manhood and a denial of the lessons of her history if young Ireland confined their efforts to remaining at home to defend the shores of Ireland from an unlikely invasion, and to shrinking from the duty of proving on the field of battle that gallantry and courage which has distinguished our race all through its history. I say to you, therefore, your duty is twofold. I am glad to see such magnificent material for soldiers around me, and I say to you: &quot;Go on drilling and make yourself efficient for the Work, and then account yourselves as men, not only for Ireland itself, but wherever the fighting line extends, in defence of right, of freedom, and religion in this war&quot;&quot;.

Redmond&#x27;s motives were twofold. Firstly, he felt it was in the future interest of an All-Ireland Home Rule settlement to support the British war cause, joining together with the Ulster Volunteers who offered immediate support by enlisting in the 36th (Ulster) Division. Secondly, he hoped that the Volunteers, with arms and training from the British, would become the nucleus of an Irish Army after Home Rule was implemented. He reminded the Irish Volunteers that when they returned after an expected short war at the end of 1915, they would be an army capable of confronting any attempt to exclude Ulster from the operation of the Government of Ireland Act.

Militant nationalists reacted angrily against Redmond&#x27;s support for the war, and nearly all of the original leaders of the Volunteers grouped together to dismiss his appointees. However, the great majority of the Volunteers supported Redmond, and became known as the National Volunteers.

==Recruitment for World War I==
The vast majority of the Volunteer membership remained loyal to Redmond, bringing some 142,000 members to the National Volunteers, leaving the Irish Volunteers with just a rump, estimated at 9,700 members. Many other Irish nationalists and parliamentary leaders, such as William O&#x27;Brien MP, Thomas O&#x27;Donnell MP, Joseph Devlin MP, and The O&#x27;Mahony, sided with Redmond&#x27;s decision and recruited to support the British and Allied war effort. Five other MPs, J. L. Esmonde, Stephen Gwynn, Willie Redmond, William Redmond, and D. D. Sheehan, as well as former MP Tom Kettle, joined Kitchener&#x27;s New Service Army during the war.

Many Irishmen enlisted voluntarily in Irish regiments of the New British Army, forming part of the 10th (Irish) and 16th (Irish) Divisions. Out of a National Volunteer membership of about 150,000, roughly 24,000 (about 24 battalions) were to join those Divisions for the duration of the war. Another 7,500 joined reserve battalions in Ireland. The National Volunteers were therefore a minority among the 206,000 Irishmen who served as volunteers for the British Army in the war, and so failed to constitute a nascent Irish Army as Redmond had hoped. Recruiting for the war among the National Volunteers, after an initial burst of enthusiasm, proved rather sluggish. According to historian Fergus Campbell, &quot;most of the members of the National Volunteers were farmers&#x27; sons, and members of this social group were reluctant to join the colours&quot;. A police report of late 1914 commented: &quot;Though the large majority of the nominal National Volunteers approve of Mr. Redmond&#x27;s pronouncement, only very few will enlist&quot;. A contemporary writer felt that, &quot;at the back of it was a vague feeling that to fight for the British Empire was a form of disloyalty to Ireland.

Moreover, Redmond&#x27;s hopes for an Irish Army Corps were also to end in disappointment for him. Instead, a New Army 16th (Irish) Division was created. The Division was largely officered by Englishmen (an exception was William Hickie, an Irish born general), which was not a popular decision in nationalist Ireland. This outcome was in part due to the lack of trained Irish officers; the few trained officers had been sent to the 10th Division, and those still available had been included into Sir Edward Carson&#x27;s 36th (Ulster) Division. In addition, Redmond&#x27;s earlier statement, that the Irish New Army units would return armed and capable of enforcing Home Rule, aroused War Office suspicions.

==The National Volunteers after 1914==
The war&#x27;s popularity in Ireland and the popularity of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party were badly dented by the severe losses subsequently suffered by the Irish divisions. In addition, the postponement of the implementation of Home Rule damaged both the IPP and the National Volunteers.

The majority of the National Volunteers (over 120,000 or 80%) did not enlist in the British Army. John Redmond had intended that they would form an official home defence force for Ireland during the War, but the British War Office baulked at arming and training the Irish nationalist movement. Military historian Timothy Bowman has described the situation as follows: &quot;While Kitchener saw the UVF as an efficient military force and was prepared to offer concessions to secure the services of UVF personnel in the British army his view of the INV was very different. The INV were, even in comparison to the UVF, an inefficient military force in 1914, lacked trained officers, finances and equipment. Kitchener was certainly not inclined to, as he saw it, waste valuable officers and equipment on a force which, at best, would relieve Territorial units from garrison duties and, at worst, would provide Irish Nationalists with the ability to enforce Home Rule on their own terms.

In fact, the National Volunteers fell into decline as the war went on. Their strength fell to around 100,000 by February 1916, and moreover their companies tended to fall into inactivity. In many cases, this was put down to a fear of conscription being introduced into Ireland should they drill too openly. For this reason, British sources reported by early 1916 that the National Volunteers as a movement were &quot;practically dead&quot; or &quot;non-existent&quot;.

The National Volunteers&#x27; other problem was a lack of leadership, as many of its most committed and militarily experienced members had enlisted in Irish Regiments for the war. As a result, the RIC (police) report on them concluded: &quot;It is a strong force on paper, but without officers and untrained, it is little better than a large mob&quot;. They staged a very large rally, of over 20,000 men, on Easter Sunday 1915 in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park, but their Inspector General, Maurice Moore, saw no military future for the organisation: &quot;They cannot be trained, disciplined or armed, moreover, the enthusiasm has gone and they cannot be kept going... it will be of no practical use against any army, Orange or German.&quot;

By contrast, the smaller but more militant Irish Volunteers increased in both numbers and activity as the War went on. The numerical increase was modest, from 9,700 in 1914 to 12,215 by February 1916, but they trained regularly and had kept most of the Volunteer weaponry. By March 1916, the RIC was reporting that the Irish Volunteers, &quot;are foremost among [nationalist] political societies, not by reason of their numerical strength but on account of their greater activity&quot;. In April 1916, a faction within the Irish Volunteers launched the Easter Rising, an armed insurrection centred in Dublin aimed at the ending of British rule in Ireland. During the Rising, one unit of the National Volunteers (in Craughwell, County Galway), offered its services to the local RIC to help suppress the rebellion in that area.

The rebellion was put down within a week by the British Army (including Irish units such as the Royal Dublin Fusiliers). In its aftermath, and especially after the Conscription Crisis of 1918 in which the British Cabinet had planned to impose conscription in Ireland, the National Volunteers were eclipsed by the Irish Volunteers, whose membership shot up to over 100,000 by the end of 1918. John Redmond&#x27;s Irish Parliamentary Party was similarly overtaken by the separatist Sinn Féin party in the general elections in December 1918.

After the Armistice in November 1918, around 100,000 Irishmen, including the surviving members of the National Volunteers who had enlisted, were demobilised from the British Army.

Irish Republicanism had now displaced constitutional nationalism as represented by the Irish Parliamentary Party, leading to the Irish Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of armed conflict against the British (1919). The Third Home Rule Bill was never implemented, and was repealed by the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (the Fourth Home Rule Bill), which partitioned Ireland (1921).

<text>Jacob Nelson Fox (December 25, 1927 – December 1, 1975) was an American professional baseball player. Fox was one of the best second basemen of all time, and the third-most difficult hitter to strike out in Major League Baseball (MLB) history. Fox played in the big leagues from 1947 through 1965 and spent the majority of his career as a member of the Chicago White Sox; his career was bookended by multi-year stints for the Philadelphia Athletics and, later, the Houston Astros.

Fox was an American League (AL) All-Star for twelve seasons, an AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) for one season, and an AL Gold Glove winner for three seasons. He had a .288 major-league career batting average with 2663 hits, 35 home runs, and 790 runs batted in. He hit .300 or more six times, and led the AL in singles eight times (seven consecutive seasons) and in fielding average six times as a second baseman. His career fielding percentage was .984. In 1959, when the &quot;Go Go&quot; Chicago White Sox won the American League pennant, he hit .306 with 149 singles and 70 RBI. He coached for the Houston Astros and Texas Rangers after his playing career. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Early years==
Fox was born on Christmas Day 1927 in St. Thomas Township, Pennsylvania, a rural area just west of Chambersburg, in south central Pennsylvania. He was the youngest of three sons born to a carpenter who grew up on a farm and liked to play town baseball in St. Thomas. Despite his short stature, with the help of his father, Fox distinguished himself as a baseball player at a young age, even playing with his father on their St. Thomas team.

Fox at age 16 in 1944, thought that he had a good chance to sign on with a professional baseball team due to player shortages during World War II. His mother wrote a letter on her son&#x27;s behalf to Connie Mack, the owner/manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, which enabled him to attend an open tryout that spring for the Athletics in Frederick, Maryland. Fox caught the attention of Mack, who signed him to a professional contract.

==Professional baseball==

===Minor leagues===
Fox started his professional baseball career with the Lancaster team of the Pennsylvania Interstate League and the Jamestown Falcons where he hit .314. He played a range of infield and outfield positions, ultimately settling at second base. He came back with Lancaster in 1945 and was known as the best second baseman in the league. The Philadelphia Athletics bought his contract that year, but Fox did not get to play for them then because he was called to service and was stationed in Korea in 1946.

===Major leagues===

Fox&#x27;s major league career began in when he started to play for the Philadelphia Athletics, but he played mostly in the minor leagues, appearing in a total of ten MLB games in 1947 and 1948. In 1949, the Philadelphia Athletics set a major league team record of 217 double plays, a record which still stood as of . Fox appeared in 88 of the Athletics games that season, and contributed to 68 of the team&#x27;s double plays.

The Athletics traded Fox to the Chicago White Sox for Joe Tipton on October 29, . He spent the next 14 seasons with the Sox, making 12 AL All-Star teams and 15 of 16 AL All-Star Game selections beginning in 1951 (two All-Star games were played in 1959 through 1962) when he batted .313. The White Sox finished in third place in each season between 1952 and 1956, followed by second-place finishes in 1957 and 1958 (Baseball-Reference.com lists Billy Pierce and Minnie Miñoso as the top White Sox players during most of those years, as reflected by wins above replacement (WAR), but Fox had the team&#x27;s highest WAR in 1957).

====1959 season====
Fox&#x27;s best season came in 1959, when he received the AL Most Valuable Player award (not until Dustin Pedroia in would another American League second baseman receive such an honor) on a White Sox team that won its first AL pennant in 40 years. He batted .306, had an on-base percentage of .380, and led the AL in singles. He also started and had four hits in two All-Star games and won his second Gold Glove. The Al López-managed White Sox had the best record in baseball, going 94-60 to finish five games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and a surprising 15 ahead of the New York Yankees. It was one of just two seasons the Yankees did not win the pennant between –.

In the World Series, Fox batted a team-high .375 with three doubles, but the Sox lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. In Game 5, Fox scored the only run when Sherm Lollar hit into a double play in the fourth inning (this was only the second time that a World Series game did not have an RBI). It was Fox&#x27;s only postseason experience, and the White Sox did not make it back to the World Series until they swept the 2005 World Series from the Houston Astros.

====Later career====
Fox played his final two seasons (1964–65) with the Houston Colt .45s and Astros. Joe Morgan later said that he looked up to Fox&#x27;s example as a rookie with the Astros; Fox and Morgan were both diminutive second basemen. Morgan grew up hitting with a Nellie Fox model bat, which had a large barrel and large handle. With the Astros, Fox convinced Morgan to switch to a bat with a thin handle to leverage his power.

Fox was 5-foot-9, but made up for his modest size and minimal power — he hit only 35 home runs in his career, and never more than six in a single season — with his good batting eye, excellent fielding, and baserunning speed. Fox was perennially one of the toughest batters to strike out, fanning just 216 times in his career, an average of once every 42.7 at-bats, which ranks him third all-time. He led the league in most at-bats per strikeouts a phenomenal 13 times in his career. In 1951, Fox hit more triples (12) than he had strikeouts (11). A solid contact hitter (lifetime .288 batting average), he batted over .300 six times, with 2,663 hits, 355 doubles, and 112 triples. He also led the league in singles for seven straight years, in triples once, and in hits four times.

====Defensive skills====
Fox was one of the best second basemen in the major leagues. He played next to a pair of slick-fielding White Sox shortstops from Venezuela, Chico Carrasquel (1950–55) and Luis Aparicio (1956–62). He was the first major league Gold Glove Award winner for a second baseman in , and he received two more Gold Glove awards, in and . Between August 1956 and September 1960, Fox played a major-league record 798 consecutive games at second base. In 1959 and 1960, the Aparicio-Fox middle infield duo won two Gold Gloves twice for their respective positions, becoming the first (of now a dozen) shortstop-second baseman combinations who both won Gold Gloves in the same season.

Fox led the league&#x27;s second basemen in defensive games played each season between 1952 and 1959. He also led second basemen in putouts between 1952 and 1961, and in assists several times during his career. Fox finished among the top five second basemen in fielding percentage every year between 1950 and 1964, and currently ranks second in career double plays as a second baseman.

====Coaching seasons====

Fox was a coach for the Houston Astros (1965–67) and the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers (1968–72). In the late 1960s, Fox appeared to have a chance to manage the Senators when Jim Lemon&#x27;s post came open following the team&#x27;s purchase by Bob Short. However, around the same time the Washington Redskins named Vince Lombardi as their football coach, so Short felt pressure to hire a manager with a very well-known name and selected Ted Williams for the position.

==Later years==
Fox lived in St. Thomas Township, Pennsylvania, after his playing days were over. He co-owned and managed Nellie Fox Bowl in Chambersburg after retiring from baseball. Fox was diagnosed with skin cancer in 1973. In October 1975, he was admitted to the Baltimore Cancer Research Center and treated for metastatic cancer. Fox died on December 1, 1975, at the age of 47. He was buried at the St. Thomas Cemetery in his hometown of St. Thomas.

==Legacy==

Jim Lemon, who played for the White Sox with Fox in 1963, said that Fox&#x27;s cancer &quot;had to be incurable – because if it wasn&#x27;t, Nellie would have beat it.&quot; Former White Sox manager Al López described how Fox had found success through hard work rather than natural ability: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t fast and didn&#x27;t have an arm, but he worked hard to develop what he needed to make himself a good all-around ballplayer. If you had eight Nellie Foxes, all with his spirit and determination, I think you&#x27;d have a winning team.&quot; On May 1, 1976, Fox&#x27;s uniform number 2 was retired by the White Sox; he is the second of ten White Sox players to have his uniform number retired.

Fox was not selected to the Hall of Fame in his initial period of eligibility. In his final ballot cast by baseball writers in 1985, he gained 74.7 percent of the vote, just shy of the 75 percent (traditionally baseball percentages were rounded off) required for election by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. However, in , the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Veterans Committee elected him. He had the required 75% of the committee&#x27;s vote in 1996, but the committee was allowed to vote in only one former MLB player; Jim Bunning was inducted after receiving one more vote than Fox. Prior to his Hall of Fame election, a group of fans formed the Nellie Fox Society to promote his case for induction. The group grew to as many as 600 members, including Richard M. Daley, James R. Thompson, George Will and several former MLB players.

In 2001, a Pennsylvania state historical marker was dedicated to honor Fox. Bronze statues of Fox and Aparicio were unveiled on the outfield concourse of U.S. Cellular Field in 2006. Fox&#x27;s statue depicts him flipping a baseball toward Aparicio, while Aparicio is depicted as preparing to receive the ball from Fox.

<doc id="568208" wikidata="Q213841" url="?curid=568208" title="A Series of Unfortunate Events">
<text>A Series of Unfortunate Events is a series of thirteen children&#x27;s novels written by American author Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The books follow the turbulent lives of orphaned siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. After their parents&#x27; death in a fire, the children are placed in the custody of a murderous villain, Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance and causes numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee. As the plot progresses, the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society, which also involves Olaf and Snicket, the author&#x27;s own fictional self-insert.

Characterized by Victorian Gothic tones and absurdist textuality, the books are noted for their dark humour, sarcastic storytelling, and anachronistic elements, as well as frequent cultural and literary allusions. They have been classified as postmodern and metafictional writing, with the plot evolution throughout the later novels being cited as an exploration of the psychological process of the transition from the innocence of childhood to the moral complexity of maturity. As the series progresses, the Baudelaires must face the reality that their actions have become morally ambiguous, blurring the lines between which characters should be read as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot;.

Since the release of the first novel, &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;, in September 1999, the books have gained significant popularity, critical acclaim, and commercial success worldwide, spawning a film, a video game, assorted merchandise, and a television series. The main thirteen books in the series have collectively sold more than 60 million copies and have been translated into 41 languages. Several companion books set in the same universe of the series have also been released, including &quot;Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography&quot;, &quot;The Beatrice Letters&quot;, and the noir prequel tetralogy &quot;All the Wrong Questions&quot;, which chronicles Snicket&#x27;s childhood.

== Background ==
Prior to the publication of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, Handler had never written for children. According to an interview with Handler, he was encouraged to try writing children&#x27;s books by his friend and editor, Susan Rich. In a separate author interview, Daphne Merkin wrote that Handler adapted a manuscript for a &quot;mock-gothic&quot; book originally intended for adults into a series more suited for children. Handler invented the pseudonym &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; as an inside joke among friends years before the publication of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;.

Handler acknowledges Edward Gorey and Roald Dahl as influences for his writing style in the series. The first book in the series, &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;, was released on September 30, 1999.

== Series overview ==
=== Plot ===
The series follows the adventures of three orphaned siblings. Lemony Snicket documents their lives and explains to the readers that very few positive things happen to the children.

The series begins when the orphans are alone at a beach, where they receive news that their parents have been perished in a fire that also destroyed the family mansion. In &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;, they are sent to live with a distant relative named Count Olaf after briefly living with Mr. Poe, a banker in charge of the orphans&#x27; affairs. The siblings discover that Count Olaf intends to get his hands on the enormous Baudelaire fortune, which Violet is to inherit when she reaches the age of eighteen. In the first book, Olaf attempts to marry Violet to steal the Baudelaire fortune, doing so by pretending that the marriage is the storyline for his latest play, involving the oblivious Justice Strauss. The plan falls through when Violet uses her non-dominant hand to sign the marriage document, thus causing the marriage to be invalidated. After the crowd realizes, Olaf manages to escape with his henchmen.

In the following six books, Olaf disguises himself, finds the children, and, with help from his many accomplices, tries to steal their fortune, committing arson, murder, and other crimes. In books eight through twelve, the orphans adopt disguises while on the run from the police after Count Olaf frames them for a murder he has committed. The Baudelaires routinely try to get help from Mr. Poe, but he, like many of the adults in the series, is oblivious to the dangerous reality of the children&#x27;s situation.

As the books continue, another running plot is revealed concerning a mysterious secret organization known as the Volunteer Fire Department (V.F.D.). From &quot;The Austere Academy&quot; onwards, the connections between the Baudelaires, the V.F.D., and their parents&#x27; deaths are slowly revealed, leading the siblings to question their previous lives and family history. The siblings become increasingly involved with the organization until they are forced to flee with Count Olaf to an island where Olaf accidentally causes the deaths of himself and possibly the idyllic colonists of the island, whose fates are left unknown. Having finally found a safe place to live, the children spend the next year raising the baby of one of their parents&#x27; friends from V.F.D. who died giving birth to the child. After a year, the siblings decide to try to return to the mainland to continue their lives.

=== Setting ===
The books seem to be set in an alternate, &quot;timeless&quot; world with stylistic similarities to both the 19th century and the 1930s, though with contemporary, and seemingly anachronistic scientific knowledge. For instance, in &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot;, the Baudelaire children send a message via Morse code on a telegraph, yet the general store they are in has fiber-optic cable for sale. An &quot;advanced computer&quot; appears in &quot;The Austere Academy&quot;.

Danielle Russell, a professor at Glendon College, argues that the settings are reflective of familiar places, but are &quot;bizarre&quot; enough that young readers feel distanced from the world of the Baudelaires. The setting of the world has been compared to &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; in that it is &quot;suburban gothic&quot;. While the film version sets the Baudelaire mansion in the city of Boston, Massachusetts, real places rarely appear in the books, though some are mentioned. For example, in &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot;, a book in Jerome and Esmé Squalor&#x27;s library was titled &quot;Trout, in France They&#x27;re Out&quot;. There are also references to the fictional nobility of North American regions, specifically the Duchess of Winnipeg and the King of Arizona.

=== Characters ===
Violet Baudelaire, the oldest child in the series, uses her inventive mind to create various helpful items, showcasing her talent and resourcefulness. Klaus Baudelaire, the middle child, is twelve when the series begins; he loves all types of books and is an extraordinary speed reader with a photographic memory. Sunny Baudelaire is a baby at the beginning of the series and enjoys biting things with her abnormally large and sharp teeth; she develops a love for cooking later in the series. 

In most books, the children&#x27;s skills are used to help them defeat Count Olaf&#x27;s plots; for instance, Violet invents a lockpick in &quot;The Reptile Room&quot;. Occasionally, the children must switch roles, such as when Klaus must try inventing and Violet reading in &quot;The Miserable Mill&quot;. Other characters (usually other children) also have particular skills that they use to assist the Baudelaires, for example, Duncan Quagmire used his journaling skills to remember important information, Isadora wrote poems to pass notes, and Quigley Quagmire&#x27;s cartography skills help Violet and Klaus in &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot;.

Snicket translates for the youngest Baudelaire orphan, Sunny, who in the early books almost solely uses words or phrases that make sense only to her siblings. As the series progresses, her speech often contains disguised meanings. Some words are spelled phonetically: &#x27;Suruchi&#x27; in &quot;The Slippery Slope &quot;and &#x27;Kikuchi?&#x27; in &quot;The End&quot;; some are spelled backwards: &quot; in &quot;The Carnivorous Carnival&quot;, and &quot; in &quot;The Miserable Mill&quot;. Others contain references to culture or people: for instance, when Sunny says &quot;Busheney&quot; (combining the last names of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, presumably), it is followed by the definition of &quot;you are a vile man who has no regard for anyone else&quot;. Some words Sunny uses are foreign, such as &quot;Shalom&quot;, &quot;Sayonara&quot;, or &quot;Arrête&quot;. Some are more complex, such as when she says &quot;Akrofil, meaning, &#x27;they were not afraid of heights&#x27;&quot;, which phonetically translates to acrophilia, meaning one who loves heights. She begins to use standard English words towards the end of the books, one of her longer sentences being &quot;I&#x27;m not a baby&quot; in &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot;.

When asked in a &quot;Moment Magazine&quot; interview about the Baudelaire children and Snicket&#x27;s own Jewish heritage he replied, &quot;Oh yeah! Yes. The Baudelaires are Jewish! I guess we would not know for sure, but we would strongly suspect it, not only from their manner but from the occasional mention of a rabbi or bar mitzvah or synagogue. The careful reader will find quite a few rabbis.&quot;

== Literary analysis and themes==

=== Allusions ===
While the books are marketed primarily to children, the series features numerous references that adults or older children are more likely to understand.

Many of the characters&#x27; names allude to other fictional works or real people with macabre connections. For example, &quot;The Reptile Room&quot; includes allusions to Monty Python (the Baudelaire children&#x27;s uncle Monty has a large snake collection that includes a python, and a reference to the &quot;Self-Defence Against Fresh Fruit&quot; sketch). The Baudelaire orphans are named after Charles Baudelaire; Violet&#x27;s name also comes from the T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, specifically its verses concerning the &quot;violet hour&quot;, and Sunny and Klaus take their first names from Claus and Sunny von Bülow, while Mr. Poe is a reference to Edgar Allan Poe (his sons are named Edgar and Albert). In the seventh installment, &quot;The Vile Village&quot;, Count Olaf&#x27;s disguise, Detective Dupin, is an allusion to C. Auguste Dupin, a fictional detective created by Edgar Allan Poe.

Isadora and Duncan Quagmire are named after Isadora Duncan, a notorious dancer also remembered for her unusual death by strangulation when her scarf entangled around the wheels of the open car in which she was a passenger. In the fourth book, &quot;The Miserable Mill&quot;, Dr. Georgina Orwell is a reference to British author George Orwell. Orwell finished his famous book &quot;1984&quot; in 1948, and in the sixth book, &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot;, it is not clear if the skyscraper in which Esmé and Jerome Squalor live has 48 or 84 stories. The Squalors&#x27; names reference Jerome David &quot;J. D.&quot; Salinger and his short story &quot;For Esmé – with Love and Squalor&quot;. While in an auction on which the plot hinges, Lot 49 is skipped, i.e. not cried, an allusion to Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;. Both Salinger and Pynchon were reputed not to be actual persons at one time. The ninth book in the series, &quot;The Carnivorous Carnival&quot;, takes place at Caligari Carnival; the carnival&#x27;s name is a nod to the 1920 silent horror film &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;. Also in the ninth book, Hugo the Hunchback&#x27;s name is an allusion to French author Victor Hugo, who wrote the famous book &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Subsequently, many of the inhabitants of the island the Baudelaires find themselves on in &quot;The End&quot; are named after characters from &quot;The Tempest&quot;, a play by William Shakespeare, while some are named after characters from &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and others after general nautical or island-based literature. The Fire and the Sugar Bowl was inspired by &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; by Shirley Jackson.

The name of Beatrice, Snicket&#x27;s dedicatee, may be an allusion to the poem &quot;La Béatrice&quot; by Charles Baudelaire. The poem references an &quot;actor without a job&quot;, like the actor Count Olaf. The poem also begins with the line &quot;In a burnt, ash-grey land without vegetation&quot;, similar to the Baudelaire mansion burning down at the beginning of the series. The name Beatrice could also be an allusion to Italian poet Dante. Dante dedicated all of his works to &quot;Beatrice&quot;, with whom he was obsessed, and who was also dead, like Snicket&#x27;s Beatrice.

In the final book, in an allusion to the Book of Genesis, a snake offers the children a life-giving apple (which the other characters in &quot;The End&quot; refuse to eat despite the fact that it is a cure for a fatal illness).

=== Genre ===
This series is most commonly classified as children&#x27;s fiction, but the book has also been classified in more specific genres such as gothic fiction, or some variety thereof, whether it is mock-gothic, a satire of gothic literature, neo-Victorian or &quot;suburban gothic&quot;. The series has been described as absurdist fiction, because of its strange characters, improbable storylines, and black comedy.

The books can be categorized as mystery novels. According to Chris McGee, the Baudelaires spend the series trying to uncover the truth about their parents&#x27; deaths. He also likens the series to noir fiction. Danielle Russell argues that mysteries are solved for the reader by their end. So, the lack of clear answers in &quot;The End&quot; does not align with this genre.

Although the series does not neatly fit into the genres of fantasy or science fiction, it does feature occasional instances of whimsy, the supernatural, and steampunk technology. There is a constant theme of some form of fate guiding the characters throughout the books. The Baudelaires are capable of communicating with their infant sister, as well as with reptiles. The Reptile Room houses a variety of fantastical reptiles, including the Incredibly Deadly Viper, which is extremely intelligent and seems to have a humanoid consciousness. There is a mysterious aquatic monster known as The Great Unknown.

In a paper for the Maria Curie-Sklodowski University, Barbara Kaczyńska claims that &quot;realism&quot; is absent within the series. Russell disputes this, noting that throughout the novels the narrator insists that the stories he recounts are completely true. She believes that this strong level of realism discredits any argument that the books can be classified as fantasies.

=== Morality in the series ===
Social commentary is a major element in the books, which often comment on the seemingly inescapable follies of human nature. The books consistently present the Baudelaire children as free-thinking and independent, while the adults around them obey authority and succumb to mob psychology, peer pressure, ambition, and other social ills. A high account is given to learning: those who are &quot;well-read&quot; are often sympathetic characters, while those who shun knowledge are villains.

Tison Pugh argues that the central issue of the series is whether the Baudelaires are morally good and distinct from the villains of the story, or whether their actions make them as morally ambiguous as the so-called evil characters.

Evil characters are shown to have sympathetic characteristics. Similarly, good characters&#x27; flaws become major problems. The books highlight the inevitability of temptation and moral decision-making, regardless of the external situation. This indicates that regardless of one&#x27;s outside influences, one always has the final choice in whether to be good or bad. Characters that make brave decisions to fight back and take charge are almost always &quot;good&quot;, and characters that just go along end up as &quot;bad.&quot; However, some characters suggest that people are neither good nor bad, but a mix of both. Rebecca-Anne C. Do Rozario notes the nihilistic tone of the series, claiming the lines between good and evil acts become blurred to the point where they become meaningless.

=== Narration style ===

The series is narrated by Lemony Snicket, the pseudonym of Daniel Handler. He dedicates each of his works to his deceased love interest, Beatrice, and often attempts to dissuade the reader from reading the Baudelaires&#x27; unfortunate story. Handler has referred to Lemony Snicket as a &quot;character&quot; who also doubles as the series&#x27; narrator. Some details of his life are explained somewhat in a supplement to the series, &quot;Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography&quot;.

When Snicket describes a word the reader may be unfamiliar with, he typically follows it with the saying &quot;a word which here means . . . .&quot; He sometimes follows this phrase with a humorous definition, or one that is relevant only to the events at hand (for example, he describes &quot;adversity&quot; as meaning &quot;Count Olaf&quot;).

Lemony Snicket continuously maintains that the story is true and that it is his &quot;solemn duty&quot; to record it. Snicket often goes off into humorous or satirical asides, discussing his opinions or personal life.

Lemony Snicket&#x27;s narration and commentary are characteristically cynical and despondent. In the blurb for each book, Snicket warns of the misery the reader may experience in reading about the Baudelaire orphans and suggests abandoning the books altogether. However, he also provides ample comic relief with wry, dark humor. Snicket&#x27;s narration has been described as &quot;self-conscious&quot; and &quot;post-modern&quot;. Daphne Merkin characterizes Snicket&#x27;s narration style as &quot;droll and detached.&quot;

When describing a character whom the Baudelaires have met before, Snicket often describes the character first and does not reveal the name of the character until they have been thoroughly described. Lemony Snicket starts each book with a &quot;post-modern dissection of the reading experience&quot; before linking it back to how he presents the story of the Baudelaires and what their current situation is. Snicket often uses alliteration to name locations, as well as book titles, throughout the story. Many of the books start with a theme being introduced that is continually referenced throughout the book—such as the repeated comparisons of the words &quot;nervous&quot; and &quot;anxious&quot; in &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot;, the consistent use of the phrase &quot;where there&#x27;s smoke, there&#x27;s fire&quot; in &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot;, and the descriptions of the water cycle in &quot;The Grim Grotto&quot;.

=== Repetition ===
The plots of the first seven books follow the same basic pattern: the Baudelaires go to a new guardian in a new location, where Count Olaf appears and attempts to steal their fortune. The books following pick up where the previous book ended. There are thirteen books in the series and each book has thirteen chapters. The last book in the series, &quot;The End&quot;, contains two stories: &quot;The End&quot;, which has 13 chapters, and a separate &quot;book&quot; that is titled &quot;Chapter Fourteen&quot;. The location of each book&#x27;s events is usually identified in the book&#x27;s title; the first twelve book titles are generally alliterative.

=== Secrets in the series ===

After the fourth book, Barbara Kaczyńska argues that secrets play a more important role in the story. In the final book, &quot;The End&quot;, the concept is especially important, as demonstrated by a several-page-long discussion of the phrase &quot;in the dark.&quot; The children hear of a massive schism within the organization of V.F.D., which was once noble but became filled with corruption and split into two sides, &quot;volunteers&quot; and &quot;villains.&quot; While many of the critical plot points are given answers, Snicket explains that no story can be fully devoid of questions as every story is intertwined with numerous others and every character&#x27;s history is shared in a great web of mysteries and unfortunate events that make up the world&#x27;s legacy, making it impossible for anyone to know all the answers to every question. The Baudelaire children and Count Olaf&#x27;s story is said to be merely a fragment of a much bigger story between numerous characters with the central connection being the organization of V.F.D.

=== Clues ===
There is a full-page picture at the end of each book, showing a hint or clue about the content of the next book. This may show a flyer or piece of paper drifting by, though sometimes by a significant object: a snake appears at the end of &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;, referring to Montgomery&#x27;s snake collection in the following book. The same picture is used at the start of the succeeding book. This practice continued at the end of &quot;The End&quot; which shows a boat sailing off into the sunset and at the start of &quot;Chapter Fourteen&quot;. The picture at the end of &quot;Chapter Fourteen&quot; includes a shape of a question mark.

Following the picture is a letter to the editor, which explains to the editor how to get a manuscript of the next book. Snicket is writing from the location of the next book and usually reveals its title. Snicket notes that the editors will find various objects along with the manuscript, all of them having some impact in the story. Starting with the fourth book (which previews the fifth), each letter has a layout relating to the next book, such as torn edges, fancy stationery, sopping wet paper, or telegram format. The letters change dramatically starting with the letter at the end of &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot;—for this preview letter, the letter is ripped to shreds and only a few scraps remain. The remaining letters are difficult to read, and some do not reveal the title. The final letter appears at the end of &quot;The End&quot; and simply has &quot;The end of THE END can be found at the end of THE END.&quot; There is no letter after &quot;Chapter Fourteen&quot;.

Each book begins with a dedication to a woman named Beatrice, and references to her are made by Snicket throughout the series, describing her as the woman he still loves while emphasizing the fact that she apparently died long ago. At the end of the &quot;Chapter Fourteen&quot; epilogue, it is revealed that Beatrice was the Baudelaires&#x27; late mother, who married their father after an unknown event caused her to return Snicket&#x27;s engagement ring, alongside a two-hundred-page book explaining all the reasons she could not marry him.

=== Appearance ===
In an article about children&#x27;s literature, Bruce Butt describes the hardcover books as &quot;elegant&quot; and &quot;collectible.&quot; He notes that the endpapers and overall book design resemble Victorian-era novels. Danielle Russell argues that the visual stylization of the books adds to their sense of timelessness. The hardcover books were printed with a deckle edge.

There was an initial paperback release of the series, featuring restyled covers, new illustrations, and a serial supplement entitled &quot;The Cornucopian Cavalcade&quot; with &quot;The Bad Beginning: or, Orphans!&quot;, &quot;The Reptile Room: or, Murder!&quot;, and &quot;The Wide Window: or, Disappearance!&quot;.

== In other media ==
=== Television ===

Netflix, in association with Paramount Television, announced in November 2014 its plans to adapt the books into an original TV series with 25 total episodes spanning 3 seasons, with 2 episodes dedicated to each book, with the exception of the 13th book, The End. Author Daniel Handler serves as a writer and executive producer.

On September 4, 2015, it was announced that filmmaker Barry Sonnenfeld and &quot;True Blood&quot; showrunner Mark Hudis had agreed to helm the series. Hudis would serve as showrunner, Sonnenfeld as director, and both as executive producers with Daniel Handler penning the scripts. On December 3, 2015, an open casting call was announced for the roles of Violet and Klaus Baudelaire, with the casting call confirming that the series would begin production in March 2016.

In January 2016, Netflix announced that Hudis had left the project. However, it was announced that Sonnenfeld and Handler were both still on board, and that Neil Patrick Harris had been cast as Count Olaf and Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes as Violet and Klaus.

In March 2016, K. Todd Freeman and Patrick Warburton were cast as Mr. Poe and Lemony Snicket respectively. The first season, consisting of eight episodes that cover the first four books, was released worldwide on Netflix on January 13, 2017. &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; was renewed for a second season, which was released on March 30, 2018, and consisted of ten episodes that adapt books five through nine of the novel series. The television series was also renewed for a third and final season, which was released on January 1, 2019, consisting of seven episodes that adapted the final four books. The last book, &quot;The End&quot;, was adapted into one episode instead of the standard two episodes.

=== Film ===
&quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; is a film adaptation of the first three titles in the series, mixing the various events and characters into one story. It was released in United States on December 17, 2004 by Paramount Pictures and Internationally by DreamWorks Pictures. Directed by Brad Silberling, it stars Jim Carrey as Count Olaf, Meryl Streep as Aunt Josephine, Billy Connolly as Uncle Monty, Emily Browning as Violet, Liam Aiken as Klaus, Timothy Spall as Mr. Poe, and Jude Law as the voice of Lemony Snicket. The film was financially successful, and received generally positive reviews but received criticism over its comical tone.

Considering the success of the movie, the director and some of the lead actors hinted that they were keen on making a sequel, but no script was written.

Browning has said that further films would have to be produced quickly, as the children do not age much throughout the book series.

In 2008, Daniel Handler stated in a Bookslut Interview that another film was in the works, but had been delayed by corporate shake-ups at Paramount Pictures. In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. &quot;In an odd way, the best thing you could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, &#x27;Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to have to show you the real thing.&#x27;&quot;

=== Video game ===

&quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; is a video game based on the 2004 Film. It was developed by Adenium Games and Activision for PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PC. The player plays as all three orphans at points in the game, and encounters characters such as Mr. Poe, Uncle Monty and Aunt Josephine, along with villains such as Count Olaf, the Hook-Handed Man, the White-Faced Women, and the Bald Man. The game, like the movie, follows only the first three books in the series.

A separate casual game titled &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; was published by Oberon Media the same year as a different tie-in to the books. Set in Count Olaf&#x27;s house, the game involves his six associates and many objects they use in Olaf&#x27;s efforts to capture the children. Gameplay includes three difficulty levels and two game modes: Deduction Junction and Swap Monster.

=== Board games ===
A board game based on the books was distributed by Mattel in 2004, prior to the movie. &quot;The Perilous Parlor Game&quot; is for 2–4 players, ages 8 and up. One player assumes the role of Count Olaf, and the other players play the Baudelaire children. Count Olaf&#x27;s objective in the game is to eliminate the guardian, while the children try to keep the guardian alive. The game employs Clever Cards, Tragedy Cards, Secret Passage Tiles, and Disguise Tiles in play.

=== Card games ===
&quot;The Catastrophic Card Game&quot; is the second game based on the books. In this card game, players are looking to complete sets of characters. There are 4 different sets: The Baudelaire Orphans, Count Olaf in Disguise, Olaf&#x27;s Henchmen, and the Orphans Confidants. Players take turns drawing a card from either the draw pile or the top card from the discard pile in hopes of completing their sets. For 2–4 players, ages 14 and under.

=== Audio ===
==== Audio books ====
Most of the series of unabridged audiobooks are read by British actor Tim Curry, though Handler as Lemony Snicket reads books 3 to 5. Of narrating the audiobooks, Handler has said: &quot;It was very, very hard. It was unbelievably arduous. It was the worst kind of arduous.&quot; As such, future narrating duties were handed back to Curry, of whom Handler states: &quot;he does a splendid job&quot;. The &quot;Dear Reader&quot; blurb is usually read by Handler (as Snicket) at the beginning, although it is missing in &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot;. Handler usually reads the &quot;To my Kind Editor&quot; blurb about the next book at the end. Starting at &quot;The Carnivorous Carnival&quot;, there is another actor who replaces Handler in reading the two blurbs, although they are skipped entirely in &quot;The Grim Grotto&quot;. All of the recordings include a loosely related song by The Gothic Archies, a novelty band of which Handler is a member, featuring lyrics by Handler&#x27;s Magnetic Fields bandmate Stephin Merritt.

==== Album ====

In October 2006, &quot;The Tragic Treasury: Songs from A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by The Gothic Archies was released. The album is a collection of thirteen songs written and performed by Stephin Merritt (of The Magnetic Fields), each one originally appearing on one of the corresponding thirteen audiobooks of the series. Two bonus songs are included.

== Reception ==
=== Reviews ===
Reviews for &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; have generally been positive, with reviewers saying that the series is enjoyable for children and adults alike, and that it brings fresh and adult themes to children&#x27;s stories. The &quot;Times Online&quot; refer to the books as &quot;a literary phenomenon&quot;, and discuss how the plight of the Baudelaire orphans helps children cope with loss—citing the rise in sales post-September 11, 2001 as evidence. Mackey attributes the series&#x27; success to the &quot;topsy-turvy moral universe.&quot; Langbauer feels that the series &quot;offers a critique of the pieties&quot; of earlier generations and imparts &quot;its own vision of ethics.&quot; In a May 2000 article for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, Sally Lodge notes kids and educators&#x27; enthusiasm for the first four books in the series.

=== Criticism ===

Access to the books was restricted at Katy ISD Elementary School in Katy, Texas. A school in Decatur, Georgia criticized &quot;The Reptile Room&quot; for its inclusion of the word &quot;damn&quot;, canceling an author event with Handler in protest.

Criticisms include the suggested incest in Olaf&#x27;s attempt to marry his distant cousin Violet in &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;. The series has also been criticized for formulaic and repetitive storytelling, including by Bruce Butt, who likened the first eight books to &quot;junk food&quot; for children.

=== Sales ===

Within a year of &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;&#x27;s publication, the first four books in the series had a combined printing of 125,000 copies. &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; has been printed in 41 different languages, selling at least sixty-five million copies as of 2015.

=== Awards ===
&quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; won multiple literary awards, including the Colorado Children&#x27;s Book Award, the Nevada Young Readers Award and the Nene Award. It was also a finalist for the Book Sense Book of the Year.

Its sequels have continued this trend, garnering multiple awards and nominations. Among these are three IRA/CBC Children&#x27;s Choice Awards, which it received for &quot;The Wide Window&quot;, &quot;The Vile Village&quot;, and &quot;The Hostile Hospital.&quot; &quot;The Penultimate Peril&quot; won a best book prize at the Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and a 2006 Quill Book Award.

=== Book lists ===
While not technically awards, &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot; was named a &quot;Book Sense 76 Pick&quot;, and &quot;The Grim Grotto&quot; is an Amazon.com Customers&#x27; Favorite.

<text>The Atkinson–Shiffrin model (also known as the multi-store model or modal model) is a model of memory proposed in 1968 by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin. The model asserts that human memory has three separate components: 
# a &quot;sensory register&quot;, where sensory information enters memory,
# a &quot;short-term store&quot;, also called &quot;working memory&quot; or &quot;short-term memory&quot;, which receives and holds input from both the sensory register and the long-term store, and
# a &quot;long-term store&quot;, where information which has been rehearsed (explained below) in the short-term store is held indefinitely.

Since its first publication this model has come under much scrutiny and has been criticized for various reasons (described below). But it is notable for the significant influence it had in stimulating memory research.

==Summary==

The model of memories is an explanation of how memory processes work. The three-part, multi-store model was first described by Atkinson and Shiffrin in 1968, though the vac idea of distinct memory stores was by no means a new idea at the time. William James described a distinction between primary and secondary memory in 1890, where primary memory consisted of thoughts held for a short time in consciousness and secondary memory consisted of a permanent, unconscious store.But at the time the parsimony of separate memory stores was a contested notion. A summary of the evidence given for the distinction between long-term and short-term stores is given below. Additionally, Atkinson and Shiffrin included a sensory register alongside the previously theorized primary and secondary memory, as well as a variety of control processes which regulate the transfer of memory.

Following its first publication, multiple extensions of the model have been put forth such as a precategorical acoustic store, the search of associative memory model, the perturbation model, and permastore. Additionally, alternative frameworks have been proposed, such as procedural reinstatement, a distinctiveness model, and Baddeley and Hitch&#x27;s model of working memory, among others.

==Sensory register==

When an environmental stimulus is detected by the senses, it is briefly available in what Atkinson and Shiffrin called the &quot;sensory registers&quot; (also &quot;sensory buffers&quot; or &quot;sensory memory&quot;). Though this store is generally referred to as &quot;the sensory register&quot; or &quot;sensory memory&quot;, it is actually composed of multiple registers, one for each sense. The sensory registers do not process the information carried by the stimulus, but rather detect and hold information for milliseconds to seconds to be used in short-term memory. For this reason Atkinson and Shiffrin also called the registers &quot;buffers&quot;, as they prevent immense amounts of information from overwhelming higher-level cognitive processes. Information is only transferred to the short-term memory when attention is given to it, otherwise it decays rapidly and is forgotten.

While it is generally agreed that there is a sensory register for each sense, most of the research in the area has focused on the visual and auditory systems.

===Iconic memory===
Iconic memory, which is associated with the visual system, is perhaps the most researched of the sensory registers. The original evidence suggesting sensory stores which are separate to short-term and long-term memory was experimentally demonstrated for the visual system using a tachistoscope.

Iconic memory is only limited to field of vision. That is, as long as a stimulus has entered the field of vision there is no limit to the amount of visual information iconic memory can hold at any one time. As noted above, sensory registers do not allow for further processing of information, and as such iconic memory only holds information for visual stimuli such as shape, size, color and location (but not semantic meaning). As the higher-level processes are limited in their capacities, not all information from sensory memory can be conveyed. It has been argued that the momentary mental freezing of visual input allows for the selection of specific aspects which should be passed on for further memory processing. The biggest limitation of iconic memory is the rapid decay of the information stored there; items in iconic memory decay after only 0.5–1.0 seconds.

===Echoic memory===
Echoic memory, coined by Ulric Neisser, refers to information that is registered by the auditory system. As with iconic memory, echoic memory only holds superficial aspects of sound (e.g. pitch, tempo, or rhythm) and it has a nearly limitless capacity. Echoic memory is generally cited as having a duration of between 1.5 and 5 seconds depending on context but has been shown to last up to 20 seconds in the absence of competing information.

==Short-term store==

While much of the information in sensory memory decays and is forgotten, some is attended to. The information that is attended is transferred to the &quot;short-term store&quot; (also &quot;short-term memory&quot;, &quot;working memory&quot;; note that while these terms are often used interchangeably they were not originally intended to be used as such).

===Duration===
As with sensory memory, the information that enters short-term memory decays and is lost, but the information in the short-term store has a longer duration, approximately 18–20 seconds when the information is not being actively rehearsed, though it is possible that this depends on modality and could be as long as 30 seconds. Fortunately, the information can be held in the short-term store for much longer through what Atkinson and Shiffrin called rehearsal. For auditory information rehearsal can be taken in a literal sense: continually repeating the items. However, the term can be applied for any information that is attended to, such as when a visual image is intentionally held in mind. Finally, information in the short-term store does not have to be of the same modality as its sensory input. For example, written text which enters visually can be held as auditory information, and likewise auditory input can be visualized. On this model, rehearsal of information allows for it to be stored more permanently in the long-term store. Atkinson and Shiffrin discussed this at length for auditory and visual information but did not give much attention to the rehearsal/storage of other modalities due to the experimental difficulties of studying those modalities.

===Capacity===
There is a limit to the amount of information that can be held in the short-term store: 7 ± 2 chunks. These chunks, which were noted by Miller in his seminal paper &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two&quot;, are defined as independent items of information. It is important to note that some chunks are perceived as one unit though they could be broken down into multiple items, for example &quot;1066&quot; can be either the series of four digits &quot;1, 0, 6, 6&quot; or the semantically grouped item &quot;1066&quot; which is the year the Battle of Hastings was fought. Chunking allows for large amounts of information to be held in memory: 149283141066 is twelve individual items, well outside the limit of the short-term store, but it can be grouped semantically into the 4 chunks &quot;Columbus[1492] ate[8] pie[314→3.14→] at the Battle of Hastings[1066]&quot;. Because short-term memory is limited in capacity, it severely limits the amount of information that can be attended to at any one time.

==Long-term store==

The &quot;long-term store&quot; (also &quot;long-term memory&quot;) is a more or less permanent store. Information that is stored here can be &quot;copied&quot; and transferred to the short-term store where it can be attended to and manipulated.

===Transfer from STS===
Information is postulated to enter the long-term store from the short-term store more or less automatically. As Atkinson and Shiffrin model it, transfer from the short-term store to the long-term store is occurring for as long as the information is being attended to in the short-term store. In this way, varying amounts of attention result in varying amounts of time in short-term memory. Ostensibly, the longer an item is held in short-term memory, the stronger its memory trace will be in long-term memory. Atkinson and Shiffrin cite evidence for this transfer mechanism in studies by Hebb (1961) and Melton (1963) which show that repeated rote repetition enhances long-term memory. One may also think to the original Ebbinghaus memory experiments showing that forgetting increases for items which are studied fewer times. Finally, the authors note that there are stronger encoding processes than simple rote rehearsal, namely relating the new information to information which has already made its way into the long-term store.

===Capacity and duration===
In this model, as with most models of memory, long-term memory is assumed to be nearly limitless in its duration and capacity. It is most often the case that brain structures begin to deteriorate and fail before any limit of learning is reached. This is not to assume that any item which is stored in long-term memory is accessible at any point in the lifetime. Rather, it is noted that the connections, cues, or associations to the memory deteriorate; the memory remains intact but unreachable.

==Evidence for distinct stores==
At the time of the original publication there was a schism in the field of memory on the issue of a single process or dual-process model of memory, the two processes referring to short-term and long-term memory. Atkinson and Shiffrin cite hippocampal lesion studies as compelling evidence for a separation of the two stores. These studies showed that patients with bilateral damage to the hippocampal region had nearly no ability to form new long-term memories though their short-term memory remained intact. One may also be familiar with similar evidence found through the study of Henry Molaison, famously known as H.M., who underwent a severe bilateral medial temporal lobectomy which removed most of his hippocampal regions. These data suggest that there is indeed a clear separation between the short-term and long-term stores.

==Criticism==

===Sensory register as a separate store===
One of the early and central criticisms to the Atkinson–Shiffrin model was the inclusion of the sensory registers as part of memory. Specifically, the original model seemed to describe the sensory registers as both a structure and a control process. Parsimony would suggest that if the sensory registers are actually control processes, there is no need for a tri-partite system. Later revisions to the model addressed these claims and incorporated the sensory registers with the short-term store.

===Division and nature of working memory===
Baddeley and Hitch have in turn called into question the specific structure of the short-term store, proposing that it is subdivided into multiple components. While the different components were not specifically addressed in the original Atkinson-Shiffrin model, the authors do note that little research has been done investigating the different ways sensory modalities may be represented in the short-term store. Thus the model of working memory given by Baddeley and Hitch should be viewed as a refinement of the original model.

===Rehearsal as the sole transfer mechanism===
The model has been further criticized as suggesting that rehearsal is the key process that initiates and facilitates transfer of information into LTM. There is very little evidence supporting this hypothesis, and long-term recall can in fact be better predicted by a levels-of-processing framework. In this framework, items which are encoded at a deeper, more semantic level are shown to have stronger traces in long-term memory. This criticism is somewhat unfounded as Atkinson and Shiffrin clearly state a difference between rehearsal and coding, where coding is akin to elaborative processes which levels-of-processing would call deep-processing. In this light, the levels-of-processing framework could be seen as more of an extension of the Atkinson-Shiffrin model rather than a refutation.

===Division of long-term memory===
In the case of long-term memory it is unlikely that different types of information, such as the motor skills to ride a bike, memory for vocabulary, and memory for personal life events are stored in the same fashion. Endel Tulving notes the importance of encoding specificity in long-term memory. To clarify, there are definite differences in the way information is stored depending on whether it is episodic (memories of events), procedural (knowledge of how to do things), or semantic (general knowledge). A short (non-inclusive) example comes from the study of Henry Molaison (H.M.): learning a simple motor task (tracing a star pattern in a mirror), which involves implicit and procedural long-term storage, is unaffected by bilateral lesioning of the hippocampal regions while other forms of long-term memory, like vocabulary learning (semantic) and memories for events, are severely impaired.

==Search of associative memory (SAM)==
Due to the above and other criticism through the 1970s, the original model underwent many revisions to account for phenomena it could not explain. The &quot;search of associative memory&quot; (SAM) model is the culmination of that work. The SAM model uses a two-phase memory system: short- and long-term stores. Unlike the original Atkinson–Shiffrin model, there is no sensory store in the SAM model.

===Short-term store===
Short-term store takes on the form of a buffer, which has a limited capacity. The model assumes a buffer rehearsal system in which the buffer has a size, &quot;r&quot;. Items enter the short-term store and accompany other items that are already present in the buffer, until size &quot;r&quot; has been reached. Once the buffer is at full capacity, when new items enter, they replace an item, &quot;r&quot;, which already exists in the buffer. A probability of 1/&quot;r&quot; determines which already existing item will be replaced from the buffer. In general, items that have been in the buffer for longer are more likely to be replaced by new items.

===Long-term store===
The long-term store is responsible for storing relationships between different items and of items to their contexts. Context information refers to the situational and temporal factors present at the time when an item is in the short-term store, such as emotional feelings or environmental details. The amount of item-context information which is transferred to the long-term store is proportional to the amount of time that the item remains in the short-term store. On the other hand, the strength of the item-item associations is proportional to the amount of time that two items simultaneously existed in the short-term store.

===Retrieval from long-term store===

It is best to show how items are recalled from the long-term store using an example. Assume a participant has just studied a list of word pairs and is now being tested on his memory of those pairs. If the prior list contained, &quot;blanket – ocean&quot;, the test would be to recall &quot;ocean&quot; when prompted with &quot;blanket – ?&quot;.

Memories stored in long-term store are retrieved through a logical process involving the assembly of cues, sampling, recovery, and evaluation of recovery. According to the model, when an item needs to be recalled from memory the individual assembles the various cues for the item in the short-term store. In this case, the cues would be any cues surrounding the pair &quot;blanket – ocean&quot;, like the words that preceded and followed it, what the participant was feeling at the time, how far into the list the words were, etc.

Using these cues the individual determines which area of the long-term store to search and then samples any items with associations to the cues. This search is automatic and unconscious, which is how the authors would explain how an answer &quot;pops&quot; into one&#x27;s head. The items which are eventually recovered, or recalled, are those with the strongest associations to the cue item, here &quot;blanket&quot;. Once an item has been recovered it is evaluated, here the participant would decide whether &quot;blanket – [recovered word]&quot; matches &quot;blanket – ocean&quot;. If there is a match, or if the participant believes there is a match, the recovered word is output. Otherwise the search starts from the beginning using different cues or weighting cues differently if possible.

===Recency effects===
The usefulness of the SAM model and in particular its model of the short-term store is often demonstrated by its application to the recency effect in free recall. When serial-position curves are applied to SAM, a strong recency effect is observed, but this effect is strongly diminished when a distractor, usually arithmetic, is placed in between study and test trials. The recency effect occurs because items at the end of the test list are likely to still be present in short-term store and therefore retrieved first. However, when new information is processed, this item enters the short-term store and displaces other information from it. When a distracting task is given after the presentation of all items, information from this task displaces the last items from short-term store, resulting in a substantial reduction of recency.

===Problems for the SAM model===
The SAM model faces serious problems in accounting for long-term recency data and long-range contiguity data. While both of these effects are observed, the short-term store cannot account for the effects. Since a distracting task after the presentation of word pairs or large interpresentation intervals filled with distractors would be expected to displace the last few studied items from the short-term store, recency effects are still observed. According to the rules of the short-term store, recency and contiguity effects should be eliminated with these distractors as the most recently studied items would no longer be present in the short-term memory. Currently, the SAM model competes with single-store free recall models of memory, such as the Temporal Context Model. 

Additionally, the original model assumes that the only significant associations between items are those formed during the study portion of an experiment. In other words, it does not account for the effects of prior knowledge about to-be-studied items. A more recent extension of the model incorporates various features which allow the model to account for memory store for the effects of prior semantic knowledge and prior episodic knowledge. The extension proposes a store for preexisting semantic associations; a contextual drift mechanism allowing for decontextualisation of knowledge, e.g. if you first learned a banana was a fruit because you put it in the same class as apple, you do not always have to think of apples to know bananas are fruits; a memory search mechanism that uses both episodic and semantic associations, as opposed to a unitary mechanism; and a large lexicon including both words from prior lists and unpresented words.

<text>These are the [[Billboard Hot 100|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100]] number-one singles of 1982. The two longest running number-one singles of 1982 are &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot; by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder, which each stayed at the top for seven weeks. &quot;Physical&quot; by Olivia Newton-John concluded a ten-week run that began in 1981. At the time, 1982 had the second lowest number of number-one songs since 1956, with only 15 songs reaching the #1 spot.

That year, 10 acts received their first number-one songs: The J. Geils Band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Vangelis, The Human League, Survivor, John Cougar, Men at Work, Joe Cocker, Jennifer Warnes, and Toni Basil. Only one act topped the Hot 100 more than once in 1982—Daryl Hall and John Oates, with two number ones, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Go for That (No Can Do)&quot; and &quot;Maneater&quot;.

<text>&quot;Psychotic Reactions and Carburetor Dung&quot; was a 1971 essay by Lester Bangs, later collected in a book of the same name (). The essay, which talks about what is today called garage rock, contains the phrase, &quot;...punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds&#x27; sound.&quot; This is believed to be one of the first uses of the word &quot;punk&quot; to refer to a type of rock music. A large section of the essay is concerned with the imagined longer career of the garage band the Count Five, after their hit &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot;. The band split after one album, but Bangs&#x27; discussion of the imagined subsequent records is entirely fanciful.

<text>Saturnino Orestes &quot;Minnie&quot; Armas Arrieta Miñoso (, ; November 29, 1924 – March 1, 2015), nicknamed &quot;the Cuban Comet&quot;, was a Cuban professional baseball player. He began his baseball career in the Negro leagues in 1946 and became an All-Star third baseman with the New York Cubans. He was signed by the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) after the 1948 season as baseball&#x27;s color line fell. Miñoso went on to become an All-Star left fielder with the Indians and Chicago White Sox. The first Afro-Latino in the major leagues and the first black player in White Sox history, as a 1951 rookie he was one of the first Latin Americans to play in an MLB All-Star Game.

Miñoso was an American League (AL) All-Star for seven seasons and a Gold Glove winner for three seasons when he was in his 30s. He batted over .300 for eight seasons. He was the AL leader in triples and stolen bases three times each and in hits, doubles, and total bases once each. Willie Mays (179 steals) and Miñoso (167 steals) have been widely credited with leading the resurgence of speed as an offensive weapon in the 1950s. Miñoso was particularly adept at reaching base, leading the AL in times hit by pitch a record ten times, and holding the league mark for career times hit by pitch from 1959 to 1985. Miñoso, as a defensive standout, led the AL left fielders in assists six times and in putouts and double plays four times each.

Miñoso was one of the most popular and dynamic players in White Sox franchise history. He helped the &quot;Go-Go&quot; White Sox become one of the premier teams of the 1950s and 1960s. A rare power threat on a team known for speed and defense, Miñoso also held the White Sox record for career home runs from 1956 to 1974.

Miñoso left the major leagues following the 1964 season, but went on playing and managing in Mexico through 1973. He rejoined the White Sox as a coach, and made brief but highly publicized player appearances in 1976 and 1980. He became the third player to get a hit after the age of 50 and the second player to appear in the major leagues in five different decades (Nick Altrock is the other). Miñoso&#x27;s White Sox uniform number 9 was retired in 1983, and a statue of him was unveiled at U.S. Cellular Field in 2004. Miñoso was elected to the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in Exile in 1983, and to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996. In August of 2023, the former George B. McClellan Elementary School in the Bridgeport neighborhood in Chicago, was renamed Minnie Miñoso Academy. 

In 2014, Miñoso appeared for the second time as a candidate on the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Golden Era Committee election ballot for possible Hall of Fame consideration in 2015. He and the other candidates including former White Sox teammate Billy Pierce, and two other former players from Cuba, Tony Oliva and Luis Tiant, all missed induction in 2015. He and Oliva were elected to the Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life==

Miñoso was born in Perico, Cuba near Havana, the son of Carlos Armas and Cecilia Arietta. His date of birth is often cited as being November 29, 1923; however, his Republic of Cuba 1951 driver&#x27;s license and his first Topps baseball card(s) 1952/195 list his date of birth as November 29, 1925. The Miñoso baseball card that was handed out by his family to visitors who stopped by to pay their respects for Miñoso at a remembrance held for him at a Chicago church before his funeral has printed on it &quot;1924-2015&quot;.

His father worked in the fields of the sugarcane plantation on which the family lived. His mother had four other children from a previous marriage, and had the surname &quot;Miñoso&quot; from her first husband. While playing with his older brother Francisco, Orestes became referred to as a &quot;Miñoso&quot; too and he did not correct them. Later on, he would legally add &quot;Miñoso&quot; to his name when he became a U.S. citizen. Miñoso grew up playing baseball with two of his brothers and in fact managed his own team while working on his father&#x27;s plantation, finding players and the necessary equipment himself. In 1941, he moved to Havana to live with his sister and play baseball there.

==Baseball playing career==

===Cuba and Negro leagues===
Miñoso played professional baseball as a third baseman in Cuba and in the Negro leagues. He signed a contract with the team from the borough of Marianao in 1945 for $150 per month, and moved into the Negro leagues with the New York Cubans the next season and doubled his monthly salary. Batting leadoff for the Cubans, he hit .309 in 1946, and followed up with a .294 average in 1947 as they won the Negro World Series over the Cleveland Buckeyes. He was the starting third baseman for the East in the 1947 All-Star Game, and again in 1948.

Miñoso remained with the Cubans until signing with the Cleveland Indians organization during the 1948 season and starting his minor league career with the Dayton Indians of the Central League, batting .525 in 11 games.

===Cleveland Indians===
On April 19, 1949, Miñoso made his major league debut with the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first Black Cuban in the major leagues; he drew a walk as a pinch hitter in the seventh inning of a 5–1 road loss to the St. Louis Browns. He got his first hit in his next game on May 4, a single off Alex Kellner in the sixth inning of a 4–3 win over the Philadelphia Athletics. The next day, he hit his first home run, off Jack Kramer in the second inning of a 7–3 win over the Boston Red Sox. Miñoso had little further chance to make an impression, however; the Indians were signing black players more aggressively than any other team in the American League, but coming off their victory in the 1948 World Series, they were the strongest team in baseball. They had little opportunity to get Miñoso into the lineup as a rookie, as they played Ken Keltner at third base, and he had only 16 at bats through May 13 before being sent to the minor leagues. Miñoso was sent to the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League for the rest of the 1949 season and all of 1950, batting .297 the first year and following up with a .339 average and 115 runs batted in (RBIs).

Miñoso rejoined the Indians to start the 1951 season, but the team still could not find a spot for him in the lineup, as the Indians had Al Rosen at third base and Larry Doby, Dale Mitchell and Bob Kennedy in the outfield. He consequently had only 14 at bats in eight April games.

===Move to the Chicago White Sox===
On April 30, 1951, the Indians sent Miñoso to the White Sox in a three-team trade involving the Athletics, getting relief pitcher Lou Brissie from the Athletics in exchange. On May 1, Miñoso became the first black player on the White Sox, hitting a home run in Comiskey Park on the first pitch of his first at bat against the New York Yankees. He was an instant star, maintaining a batting average over .350 through most of the first half of the season, and finished the season hitting .324 – second in the AL behind the .344 mark of the Athletics&#x27; Ferris Fain. Miñoso was named for the first time to the AL All-Star roster (reserve player) becoming – along with White Sox teammate Chico Carrasquel and Washington Senators pitcher Connie Marrero – one of the first Latin Americans ever named to an All-Star team. That year, he scored 112 runs (one short of Dom DiMaggio&#x27;s league leading total) in 138 games played, topping the league with 14 triples and 31 stolen bases as well as 16 times being hit by pitches, and became known as &quot;Mr. White Sox&quot;. Following the 1951 season, he finished second in the AL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year voting behind the Yankees&#x27; Gil McDougald, drawing a protest by the White Sox due to Miñoso having better statistics in nearly every category. Miñoso also finished fourth in the year&#x27;s Most Valuable Player voting. Miñoso was regarded as such an outstanding all-around player that Yankees outfielder Mickey Mantle acquired the nickname &quot;The Commerce Comet&quot; because he reminded observers of &quot;The Cuban Comet&quot;. When batting, Miñoso had a tendency to crowd the plate, which made him particularly susceptible to &quot;beanball&quot; pitches.
Miñoso followed up with several years of outstanding play for Chicago. He led the AL in steals in both 1952 (22) and 1953 (25), and topped the league with 18 triples and 304 total bases in 1954, appearing in the All-Star Game all three years and starting in 1954. On April 14, 1953, Opening Day, he provided the only hit for the Sox in a 4–0 loss to the Indians&#x27; Bob Lemon, and on July 4, 1954, he broke up a combined no-hitter by three Indians pitchers with two out in the ninth inning of a 2–1 loss. He led AL left fielders with three double plays in 1953, and the following year led all major league left fielders with 13 assists and three double plays. In the first game of a doubleheader on May 16, 1954, he drove in six runs in a 10–5 win over the Senators, and on April 23, 1955, he scored a career-high five runs in the White Sox&#x27; record-setting 29–6 road win over the Kansas City Athletics. Miñoso again finished second in the batting race in 1954 with a .320 mark, trailing the .341 average by the Indians&#x27; Bobby Ávila (Ted Williams, who did not have enough plate appearances to qualify, would have finished second given the needed at bats). On May 18, 1955, Miñoso suffered a skull fracture from being hit in the head by a pitch from the Yankees&#x27; Bob Grim in the first inning of an 11–6 loss. He finished the season with a .288 average, his lowest from 1953 through 1960; however, he had the longest hitting streak in the AL that year and the longest of his career, a 23-game string from August 9 to 30 during which he batted .421. In addition, his 18 assists that season were not only twice as many as any other left fielder in the major leagues, but also matched the highest mark by any AL left fielder from 1945 through 1983. He also led AL left fielders in putouts for the first time with 267.

Miñoso also represented a rare power threat for the Sox; due to the dimensions of Comiskey Park, the White Sox were the only major league team who did not have a player hit 100 home runs for them prior to World War II. On September 2, 1956, he hit his 80th home run with the Sox, off Hank Aguirre, in a 4–3 win over the Indians, breaking Zeke Bonura&#x27;s team record. On September 23, 1957, in a 6–5 road loss to the Athletics, he became the first player to hit 100 home runs with the White Sox, connecting in the fourth inning off Alex Kellner. Miñoso topped AL left fielders again with 282 putouts and 10 assists in 1956, and with two double plays in 1957. He led the league in triples again in 1956 with 11, and in doubles with 36 in 1957. In the 1957 All-Star Game, he saved a 6–5 victory for the AL with a dramatic catch for the final out, with the tying run on second base. The 1957 season marked the first in which Gold Glove Awards were awarded, and Miñoso was chosen as the first honoree in left field (separate awards for both leagues were established the following year, and awards for each outfield position were discontinued for half a century after 1960 in favor of three awards for outfielders regardless of position).

===Later seasons===

====Cleveland Indians====
The White Sox traded Miñoso back to the Indians after the 1957 season in a four-player deal, with the White Sox getting pitcher Early Wynn and outfielder Al Smith in exchange for Miñoso and third baseman Fred Hatfield. With Cleveland, Miñoso hit a career high 24 home runs in 1958, and again led AL left fielders with 13 assists. He batted .302 in both 1958 and 1959, and on April 21, 1959, had a career-high five hits in a 14–1 road win against the Detroit Tigers, also driving in six runs for the second time in his career. He was involved in a notable incident in a road game against the Boston Red Sox on July 17 that year when Indians manager Joe Gordon was ejected after an interference call on the previous batter, but continued his argument instead of leaving the field; Miñoso refused to enter the batter&#x27;s box while Gordon was still arguing, and became furious when plate umpire Frank Umont called him out on three strikes. Miñoso was then ejected after throwing his bat at Umont, but apologized profusely after the game, saying he was unaware of the rule that any pitch in that situation must be called a strike regardless of its location; he served a three-game suspension. That year, he led all major league left fielders with a career-high 317 putouts, and also led the AL again with 14 assists, and received his second Gold Glove Award. Also in 1959, he made another All-Star appearance, starting in left field on July 7, the first of two All-Star Games held that year (MLB played two All-Star Games from 1959 through 1962). He went 0 for 5 in the first game and didn&#x27;t play in the second game on August 3.

====Chicago White Sox====
Miñoso was deeply disappointed over having missed playing for the White Sox during their 1959 pennant-winning season, and was thrilled to be traded back to Chicago in a seven-player deal in December, with Norm Cash being the top player sent in return. White Sox owner Bill Veeck presented Miñoso with an honorary 1959 pennant championship ring at the beginning of the 1960 season, saying that he had done as much as anyone in helping the White Sox reach the top of the league – partially through his influence in building a winning team, and partially because the Sox had acquired Wynn, who won the 1959 Cy Young Award, in exchange for Miñoso in the 1957 trade. Miñoso responded by driving in six runs for the third time in his career, hitting a grand slam in the fourth inning on Opening Day against Kansas City, and giving the Sox a 10–9 victory with a walk-off home run leading off the bottom of the ninth. Minoso had his last great season in 1960 – he made his last All-Star appearances (starter in both games), led the AL with 184 hits, had 105 RBIs, batted over .300 for the eighth and final time, and finished fourth in the MVP vote for the fourth time. He also had perhaps his best defensive season, leading all major league left fielders in putouts (277), assists (14) and double plays (3) and winning his third and final Gold Glove Award.

====St. Louis Cardinals====
After the 1961 season, in which his average dropped to .280, Miñoso was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Joe Cunningham; Miñoso had led the AL in times hit by pitch every year since his rookie season, except 1955. After struggling to adjust to his new league&#x27;s pitchers and strike zone, he missed two months of the 1962 season due to suffering a fractured skull and broken wrist from crashing into the outfield wall in the sixth inning of an 8–5 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 11, and finished the year hitting .196.

====Washington Senators====
His contract was sold to the Washington Senators prior to the 1963 season, and after hitting .229, he was released that October.

On October 12, he played in the first and only Hispanic American All-Star Game at New York&#x27;s Polo Grounds.

====Chicago White Sox====
He signed with the White Sox before the 1964 campaign, but appeared in only 30 games that year, batting .226 — almost exclusively as a pinch hitter — and hit his last home run in the second game of a doubleheader on May 6 off Ted Bowsfield in the seventh inning of an 11–4 win over the Athletics. He retired after the 1964 season.

Starting in 1965, Miñoso played for the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican League. Playing first base, he batted .360 in his first season, leading the league with 35 doubles and 106 runs scored. He continued to play in the Mexican League for the next eight seasons. He hit .265 with 12 home runs and 83 RBIs in 1973, when he was 47 years old.

===Coaching and final appearances===
In 1976, Miñoso was called out of retirement, becoming a first and third base coach for three seasons for the White Sox. He also made three game appearances for the Sox that September in games against the California Angels, picking up one single in eight at-bats (four coming as a designated hitter) — a two-out single off Sid Monge on September 12 in the second inning of a 2–1, 10-inning win, becoming, at age 52, the fourth oldest player ever to get a base hit in the major leagues. In 1980, Miñoso, age 56, was activated again to play for the White Sox, and was a pinch hitter in two games, again against the Angels. He became the fourth-oldest player ever to play in the majors, behind Nick Altrock, who at age 57, pinch hit in 1933, Charley O&#x27;Leary, who at age 58, pinch hit in 1934, and Satchel Paige, who at age 59, pitched three shutout innings in one game in 1965. Miñoso joined Altrock (1890s–1930s) as just the second player in major league history to play in five decades (1940s–1980s); out of the players who played in the major leagues in the 1940s, Miñoso was the last one to appear in a major league game. Bill Melton broke Miñoso&#x27;s White Sox record of 135 career home runs in the second game of a doubleheader on August 4, 1974, a 13–10 win over the Texas Rangers; he had tied the record in the previous day&#x27;s 12–5 loss. On August 29, 1985, Don Baylor broke Miñoso&#x27;s AL record of being hit by pitches 189 times.

In 1990, Miñoso was scheduled to make an appearance with the minor league Miami Miracle of the Florida State League and become the only professional to play in six decades; however, MLB overruled the Miracle on the idea. When the last game was played at Comiskey Park during the same season, Miñoso was invited to present the White Sox lineup card to the umpires in the pregame ceremonies at home plate. He did so while wearing the new uniform debuted by the White Sox that day, his familiar number 9 on the back. In 1993, a 67-year-old Miñoso made an appearance with the independent St. Paul Saints of the Northern League. He returned to the Saints in 2003 and drew a walk, thus becoming the only player to appear professionally in seven different decades. The earlier extensions to his career with the Sox were publicity stunts orchestrated respectively by one-time Sox owner Bill Veeck and his son Mike, who at the time owned partial or controlling interest in the team.

==Later years and death==

Miñoso lived in Chicago where he represented the Chicago White Sox as &quot;Mr. White Sox&quot;. He had three children from his first marriage: Orestes Jr., Cecilia and Marilyn. The eldest, son Orestes Jr., briefly played professional baseball. He married Sharon Rice in the 1990s and they had one son, Charles. 

He became a member of the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame in 1994, the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1996, the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on August 11, 2002, and the Cuban Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014. Miñoso was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2002.

On September 19, 2004, Minnie Miñoso Day was celebrated at U.S. Cellular Field and there was a pregame unveiling of a Minnie Miñoso statue at the field. Miñoso received the 2011 Jerome Holtzman Award from the Chicago Baseball Museum.

===Death===
Miñoso died March 1, 2015, from a torn pulmonary artery resulting from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was 90 years old. A funeral service was held for him at Holy Family Church in Chicago on March 7, with over 1,000 dignitaries, officials, friends and fans in attendance.

&quot;For South Siders and Sox fans all across the country, including me, Minnie Miñoso is and will always be ‘Mr. White Sox,’&quot; President Barack Obama said in a statement released by the White House.

Miñoso is buried at Chicago&#x27;s historic Graceland Cemetery and his graveside monument, in the shape of a baseball diamond, was unveiled in July 2024. Miñoso’s memorial is nearby that of Cubs Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The pair died weeks apart in early 2015. 

==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Miñoso became eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1970 – a year before the Hall began considering players from the Negro Leagues or taking into account the accomplishments of major leaguers in the Negro Leagues – and was dropped from the ballot for insufficient support. He was restored to the ballot five years after his final 1980 appearances as a player, and finally began to receive support as a candidate, remaining on the ballot for 14 years before his eligibility expired; however, most of the writers voting by that point had little memory of him during his prime. In 2001, historian Bill James selected Miñoso as the tenth greatest left fielder of all time; based on the then-general belief that Miñoso was born in 1922 rather than 1925, James wrote, &quot;Had he gotten the chance to play when he was 21 years old, I think he&#x27;d probably be rated among the top thirty players of all time.&quot;

Author Stuart Miller makes the case for Miñoso&#x27;s election based on the wins above replacement (WAR) statistic, which calculates the number of additional wins a team would get from a player&#x27;s production compared to having played a replacement-level minor league player at the position. Miñoso is among the top five AL players in WAR for seven of his MLB seasons, ranking first in WAR for two of those seasons. Jay Jaffe of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; has written that Miñoso&#x27;s Hall of Fame candidacy may have been damaged by the publicity stunt game appearances in his later life. He said that the biggest question for Hall of Fame voters would be how much potential major league production was taken away from Miñoso because baseball was not integrated at the outset of his career.

===Golden Era candidate===
Miñoso was selected to be on the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Golden Era Committee election ballot in 2011 and 2014. Since 2011, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America&#x27;s (BBWAA) Historical Overview Committee serves as the Hall&#x27;s screening committee every three years to identify ten long-retired players, managers, umpires, or executives (living or deceased) from the &quot;Golden Era&quot; (1947–1973) for possible induction into the Hall of Fame . In order to be inducted, any of ten candidates on the ballot must receive at least 12 of 16 votes cast by the 16-member Golden Era Committee at the MLB Winter Meeting in December. In 2011 and 2014, Miñoso received 9 and 8 votes; in 2011, only Ron Santo with 15 votes was elected to the Hall of Fame (inducted 2012). In 2014, none of the candidates were elected by the committee. He was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame on December 5, 2021. He was formally inducted on July 24, 2022, with his widow Sharon speaking on his behalf.

<doc id="568248" wikidata="Q1753225" url="?curid=568248" title="Paralanguage">
<text>Paralanguage, also known as vocalics, is a component of meta-communication that may modify meaning, give nuanced meaning, or convey emotion, by using suprasegmental techniques such as prosody, pitch, volume, intonation, etc. It is sometimes defined as relating to nonphonemic properties only. Paralanguage may be expressed consciously or unconsciously.

The study of paralanguage is known as paralinguistics and was invented by George L. Trager in the 1950s, while he was working at the Foreign Service Institute of the U.S. Department of State. His colleagues at the time included Henry Lee Smith, Charles F. Hockett (working with him on using descriptive linguistics as a model for paralanguage), Edward T. Hall developing proxemics, and Ray Birdwhistell developing kinesics. Trager published his conclusions in 1958, 1960 and 1961.

His work has served as a basis for all later research, especially those investigating the relationship between paralanguage and culture (since paralanguage is learned, it differs by language and culture). A good example is the work of John J. Gumperz on language and social identity, which specifically describes paralinguistic differences between participants in intercultural interactions. The film Gumperz made for BBC in 1982, &quot;Multiracial Britain: Cross talk&quot;, does a particularly good job of demonstrating cultural differences in paralanguage and their impact on relationships.

Paralinguistic information, because it is phenomenal, belongs to the external speech signal (Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s &quot;parole&quot;) but not to the arbitrary conmodality. Even vocal language has some paralinguistic as well as linguistic properties that can be &quot;seen&quot; (lip reading, McGurk effect), and even &quot;felt&quot;, e.g. by the Tadoma method.

==Aspects of the speech signal==

=== Perspectival aspects ===
Speech signals arrive at a listener&#x27;s ears with acoustic properties that may allow listeners to identify location of the speaker (sensing distance and direction, for example). Sound localization functions in a similar way also for non-speech sounds. The perspectival aspects of lip reading are more obvious and have more drastic effects when head turning is involved.

=== Organic aspects ===
The speech organs of different speakers differ in size. As children grow up, their organs of speech become larger, and there are differences between male and female adults. The differences concern not only size, but also proportions. They affect the pitch of the voice and to a substantial extent also the formant frequencies, which characterize the different speech sounds. The organic quality of speech has a communicative function in a restricted sense, since it is merely informative about the speaker. It will be expressed independently of the speaker&#x27;s intention.

=== Expressive aspects ===
Paralinguistic cues such as loudness, rate, pitch, pitch contour, and to some extent formant frequencies of an utterance, contribute to the emotive or attitudinal quality of an utterance. Typically, attitudes are expressed intentionally and emotions without intention, but attempts to fake or to hide emotions are not unusual.
Consequently, paralinguistic cues relating to expression have a moderate effect of semantic marking. That is, a message may be made more or less coherent by adjusting its expressive presentation. For instance, upon hearing an utterance such as &quot;I drink a glass of wine every night before I go to sleep&quot; is coherent when made by a speaker identified as an adult, but registers a small semantic anomaly when made by a speaker identified as a child. This anomaly is significant enough to be measured through electroencephalography, as an N400. Autistic individuals have a reduced sensitivity to this and similar effects.

Emotional tone of voice, itself paralinguistic information, has been shown to affect the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Some words have homophonous partners; some of these homophones appear to have an implicit emotive quality, for instance, the sad &quot;die&quot; contrasted with the neutral &quot;dye&quot;; uttering the sound /dai/ in a sad tone of voice can result in a listener writing the former word significantly more often than if the word is uttered in a neutral tone.

=== Linguistic aspects ===
Ordinary phonetic transcriptions of utterances reflect only the linguistically informative quality. The problem of how listeners factor out the linguistically informative quality from speech signals is a topic of current research.

Some of the linguistic features of speech, in particular of its prosody, are paralinguistic or pre-linguistic in origin. A most fundamental and widespread phenomenon of this kind is described by John Ohala as the &quot;frequency code&quot;. This code works even in communication across species. It has its origin in the fact that the acoustic frequencies in the voice of small vocalizers are high, while they are low in the voice of large vocalizers. This gives rise to secondary meanings such as &quot;harmless&quot;, &quot;submissive&quot;, &quot;unassertive&quot;, which are naturally associated with smallness, while meanings such as &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;dominant&quot;, and &quot;assertive&quot; are associated with largeness. In most languages, the frequency code also serves the purpose of distinguishing questions from statements. It is universally reflected in expressive variation, and it is reasonable to assume that it has phylogenetically given rise to the sexual dimorphism that lies behind the large difference in pitch between average female and male adults.

In text-only communication such as email, chatrooms and instant messaging, paralinguistic elements can be displayed by emoticons, font and color choices, capitalization and the use of non-alphabetic or abstract characters. Nonetheless, paralanguage in written communication is limited in comparison with face-to-face conversation, sometimes leading to misunderstandings.

==Specific forms of paralinguistic respiration==

===Gasps===

A gasp is a kind of paralinguistic respiration in the form of a sudden and sharp inhalation of air through the mouth. A gasp may indicate difficulty breathing and a panicked effort to draw air into the lungs. Gasps also occur from an emotion of surprise, shock or disgust. Like a sigh, a yawn, or a moan, a gasp is often an automatic and unintentional act. Gasping is closely related to sighing, and the inhalation characterizing a gasp induced by shock or surprise may be released as a sigh if the event causing the initial emotional reaction is determined to be less shocking or surprising than the observer first believed.

As a symptom of physiological problems, apneustic respirations (a.k.a. apneusis), are gasps related to the brain damage associated with a stroke or other trauma.

===Sighs===

A sigh is a kind of paralinguistic respiration in the form of a deep and especially audible, single exhalation of air out of the mouth or nose, that humans use to communicate emotion. It is a voiced pharyngeal fricative, sometimes associated with a guttural glottal breath exuded in a low tone. It often arises from a negative emotion, such as dismay, dissatisfaction, boredom, or futility. A sigh can also arise from positive emotions such as relief, particularly in response to some negative situation ending or being avoided. Like a gasp, a yawn, or a moan, a sigh is often an automatic and unintentional act. 

Scientific studies show that babies sigh after 50 to 100 breaths. This serves to improve the mechanical properties of lung tissue, and it also helps babies to develop a regular breathing rhythm. Behaviors equivalent to sighing have also been observed in animals such as dogs, monkeys, and horses.

In text messages and internet chat rooms, or in comic books, a sigh is usually represented with the word itself, &#x27;sigh&#x27;, possibly within asterisks, *sigh*.

Sighing is also a reflex, governed by a few neurons.

===Moans and groans===
Moaning and groaning both refer to an extended sound emanating from the throat, which is typically made by engaging in sexual activity. Moans and groans are also noises traditionally associated with ghosts, and their supposed experience of suffering in the afterlife. They are sometimes used to indicate displeasure.

===Throat clearing===
Throat clearing is a metamessaging nonverbal form of communication used in announcing one&#x27;s presence upon entering the room or approaching a group. It is done by individuals who perceive themselves to be of higher rank than the group they are approaching and utilize the throat-clear as a form of communicating this perception to others. It can convey nonverbalized disapproval.

In chimpanzee social hierarchy, this utterance is a sign of rank, directed by alpha males and higher-ranking chimps to lower-ranking ones and signals a mild warning or a slight annoyance.

As a form of metacommunication, the throat-clear is acceptable only to signal that a formal business meeting is about to start.
It is not acceptable business etiquette to clear one&#x27;s throat when approaching a group on an informal basis; 
the basis of one&#x27;s authority has already been established and requires no further reiteration by this ancillary nonverbal communication.

===Mhm===

 is between a literal language and movement, by making a noise &quot;hmm&quot; or &quot;mhm&quot;, to make a pause for the conversation or as a chance to stop and think.

The &quot;mhm&quot; utterance is often used in narrative interviews, such as an interview with a disaster survivor or sexual violence victim. In this kind of interview, it is better for the interviewers or counselors not to intervene too much when an interviewee is talking. The &quot;mhm&quot; assures the interviewee that they are being heard and can continue their story. Observing emotional differences and taking care of an interviewee&#x27;s mental status is an important way to find slight changes during conversation.

===Huh?===
&quot;Huh?&quot;, meaning &quot;what?&quot; (that is, used when an utterance by another is not fully heard or requires clarification), is an essentially universal expression, but may be a normal word (learned like other words) and not paralanguage. If it is a word, it is a rare (or possibly even unique) one, being found with basically the same sound and meaning in almost all languages.

==Physiology of paralinguistic comprehension==

=== fMRI studies ===
Several studies have used the fMRI paradigm to observe brain states brought about by adjustments of paralinguistic information. One such study investigated the effect of interjections that differed along the criteria of lexical index (more or less &quot;wordy&quot;) as well as neutral or emotional pronunciation; a higher hemodynamic response in auditory cortical gyri was found when more robust paralinguistic data was available. Some activation was found in lower brain structures such as the pons, perhaps indicating an emotional response.

<doc id="568252" wikidata="Q5301348" url="?curid=568252" title="Douglas College">
<text>Douglas College is the largest college in British Columbia, Canada with 7,958 full-time equivalent students in 2023-24. Douglas College offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees and general university arts and science courses, as well as career programs in health care, human services, business and the creative arts.

==History==
Founded in 1970, the college is named after the former Governor of British Columbia, Sir James Douglas. In 1981, Kwantlen College split off from Douglas College.

=== Coat of arms ===
Douglas College&#x27;s coat of arms was revealed to the public on January 21, 2020. The emblem was designed by Coast Salish artist Carrielynn Victor for the college&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The emblem was the first to be completely designed by an Indigenous artist in Canada&#x27;s history. The crowned heart in the middle of the emblem is a feature of coats of arms of the Douglas family, including the College&#x27;s namesake Sir James Douglas, and a reference to the college&#x27;s motto, &quot;Do what you love&quot;. The crown on top of it is made of cedar, a wood material that is local to the area. There is a raven on top of the crest, meant to signify cleverness as the bird represents. There are also two Douglas fir trees surrounding the raven which are meant to signify a relation to the college&#x27;s name. In the Coast Salish language, below the shield, are the words &quot;Excellence, Knowledge, Passion&quot;. The reference to the Indigenous language is a recognition that the college operates on a First Nations territory.

===Campuses===
The college has two major campuses in Metro Vancouver – one in New Westminster (Royal Avenue and Anvil Tower) and one in Coquitlam. The college also has a smaller Training Centre campus in Surrey.

==Programs==
Douglas offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, associated degrees, and various programs, certifications and diplomas.
===International education===
Each year, more than 4,000 international students from 92 countries take for-credit courses at Douglas College, accounting for roughly 18 percent of the student population.

===Media===
The &quot;Other Press&quot; was formerly the Douglas College&#x27;s student newspaper from 1976 to 2021. It was a member of Canadian University Press.

The college also publishes &quot;Event&quot;, a literary magazine published three times per year.

===Athletics===
Varsity sports teams at Douglas College are known as the Royals and the mascot is a lion named Roary. The Royals compete in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, curling, golf, soccer and volleyball as well as men&#x27;s baseball and women&#x27;s softball. The Royals are members of the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA), the Pacific Western Athletic Association (PACWEST) and the Northwest Athletic Conference (NWAC).

==Controversy==
In January 2012, Global&#x27;s 16x9 news magazine aired a story alleging large scale fraud at Douglas College&#x27;s Chinese partner campuses. Some faculty members complained that some Chinese students were unable to speak basic English upon graduation. They alleged mass-scale fraud whereby students were guaranteed to pass their courses through various methods such as black market answer sheets, progressively easier make-up exams, and grade tampering. Robert Buller, a former Dean of Commerce and Business alleged Douglas College President Scott McAlpine said &quot;he needed plausible deniability and he wanted to see and hear nothing&quot; when approached about the issue. Since then, Douglas College and the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education completed an independent review of the situation and issued a report. Although the report found &quot;no evidence of academic dishonesty or fraud in the conduct of Douglas College&quot;, it noted specific areas of concerns including in lack of oversight in the use of challenge exams. The report stated that &quot;Douglas College would have benefitted from speedier and more thoroughly considered responses&quot; to issues previously identified.

<doc id="568255" wikidata="Q4038586" url="?curid=568255" title="Fairchild Camera and Instrument">
<text>Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation was a company founded by Sherman Fairchild. It was based on the East Coast of the United States, and provided research and development for flash photography equipment. The technology was primarily used for DOD spy satellites.
The firm was later known for its manufacture of semiconductors.

==History==
===Fairchild Aviation Corporation===
Fairchild Camera and Instrument was incorporated in Delaware in 1927 as the Fairchild Aviation Corporation (also see Fairchild Aircraft), which comprised seven aircraft businesses that were the outgrowth of Fairchild Aerial Camera Corporation, which had been incorporated in 1920. The merger made Fairchild Aviation the second-largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes and the fourth-largest aviation organization in the United States.

Fairchild Aerial Camera manufactured aerial cameras for military and commercial aerial mapping that were used in Russia, Poland, and throughout South America. They were the official cameras of the United States Army and Navy Air Services.

===Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation===
In 1944, Fairchild changed the company name from Fairchild Aviation to Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. Its product portfolio expanded during World War II from aerial photography equipment to include machine gun cameras, x-ray cameras, radar cameras, gun synchronizers, and radio compasses.

After the war, military sales still represented a large portion of Fairchild&#x27;s revenue. The company won a U.S. Air Force contract for the C-82 Packet cargo and troop-carrying airplanes and spare parts. The company then began to develop products for the commercial sector such as manufacturing x-ray equipment. In 1948, the company introduced the Fairchild Lithotype for the newspaper and publishing industry. It was described as &quot;a revolutionary machine that types standard printers&#x27; type in a great variety of faces and sizes.&quot;

During the 1950s, Fairchild invested heavily in research and development, and introduced new products that ranged from devices combining radar and photography for training pilots to automatic corrected color engraving machines. In 1958 it developed high-speed processing equipment for motion pictures that could develop 500 feet of film almost instantly.

The Fairchild Company in America introduced in the early 1960s a range of Cinephonic cameras. They used pre-striped Standard 8 film. The amplifier was transistorised and the sound separation was 56 frames. The entire system was run by a rechargeable 12-volt nickel-cadmium battery that was reputed to shoot and record 800 ft of film without being recharged. The camera took 8mm film in 100 ft reels which gave five and a half minutes shooting at a speed of 24 fps.

===Fairchild Semiconductor===
In 1957, the company was approached by members of the &quot;traitorous eight&quot; to rescue the group from the authoritarian regime of William Shockley. With help from Arthur Rock Sherman Fairchild agreed to provide the venture capital to launch a division of Fairchild called Fairchild Semiconductor, from which would spawn dozens of semiconductors and Silicon Valley.

In 1960, two years after Emerson Radio had acquired DuMont&#x27;s TV manufacturing division (in 1958), Fairchild acquired the remnants of Allen B. DuMont Laboratories (oscillograph &amp; cathode-ray tube manufacturing), as well as large interest in Società Generale Semiconduttori, an Italian semiconductor producer. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, it acquired several companies in various industries: printing, sensors and magnetic heads, precision optical and photographic equipment, water quality monitoring equipment, and precision molding equipment.

Its corporate headquarters were in Syosset, New York, which were later moved to Mountain View, California when Lester Hogan assumed control of Fairchild Semiconductor.

===Fairchild Systems===
In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger. Schlumberger sold Fairchild Semiconductor to National Semiconductor in 1987; National Semiconductor was then acquired by Texas Instruments in 2011. The rest of Fairchild was renamed Fairchild Weston Systems in 1982, which was bought by Loral Corporation in 1989. The company was then renamed as the Loral Fairchild Systems division of Loral Corp.

In 1996, Lockheed Martin completed the acquisition of Loral Corporation&#x27;s defense electronics and system integration businesses, which included Fairchild, for $9.1 billion. The company became Lockheed Fairchild Systems.

In 2000, Lockheed Martin grouped Fairchild with Sanders Associates and Lockheed Martin Space Electronics &amp; Communications under the Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems division. BAE Systems agreed to acquire the division in July 2000 and completed its acquisition on in November.

===Fairchild Imaging===
In 2001, the Carlyle Group reached an agreement with BAE to spin out Fairchild&#x27;s imaging sensors division as an independent private company called Fairchild Imaging. In 2011, BAE Systems purchased Fairchild Imaging from the Carlyle Group. It is based in Milpitas, California, about twelve miles away from the site where Fairchild Semiconductor was founded.

<text>Percy Brand Blanshard ( ; August 27, 1892 – November 19, 1987) was an American philosopher known primarily for his defense of rationalism and idealism. 

==Biography==
Brand Blanshard was born August 27, 1892, in Fredericksburg, Ohio. His parents were Francis, a Congregational minister, and Emily Coulter Blanshard, Canadians who met in high school in Weston, Ontario. The freethinker and sometime &quot;The Nation&quot; editor Paul Beecher Blanshard was his fraternal twin. During a visit to Toronto in 1893, their mother Emily fell down stairs while holding a kerosene lamp. She died of burns the next day. The Rev. Mr. Blanshard brought his sons to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for maternal care by his mother, Orminda Adams Blanshard, widow of Methodist clergyman Shem Blanshard. Francis briefly left them in her care to pastor a church in Helena, Montana. In 1899 the four moved south to Edinburg Township, Ohio. Upon being diagnosed with tuberculosis, Francis was advised to seek the drier climate of the American West. In 1902, Francis Blanshard bade his mother and sons goodbye. The family moved northwest to Bay View, Michigan, while Francis moved alone to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where, in 1904, he died, alone in a tent.

Mrs. Orminda Blanshard raised her grandsons on an annual pension of $250 from the Methodist church while the boys washed dishes at a restaurant. Realizing their need for good education, the family relocated to Detroit in 1908 so the boys could graduate from the well known Central High School. Soon both were at the top of their class, joined the debating team, and Brand was made class Poet. Many years later, Bertrand Russell was to express surprise at the quality of Brand&#x27;s poetry. Brand also excelled at baseball.

In 1910 the Blanshard brothers entered the University of Michigan, whose annual tuition was only $30 for state residents. Brand discovered philosophy while majoring in classics. After a mere three years at Michigan, he obtained a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Merton College, Oxford, where he studied under Horace W. B. Joseph, who greatly influenced him, and met F.H. Bradley and T.S. Eliot. Upon the outbreak of World War I, he interrupted his studies and joined the British Army YMCA, which sent him to Bombay and Amhara, where he witnessed poverty and the horrors of war at first hand. German submarine warfare forced him to return to the US via Japan. Fate reunited the Blanshard twins at Columbia University where Paul was studying the new field of Sociology. The brothers participated in a project run by their shared mentor and friend, John Dewey. On this project they met Frances Bradshaw of Smith College - see below. Brand obtained his M.A., studying under W.P. Montague. From Columbia, he went straight into the US Army, serving in France. Once demobilized, he returned to Oxford to complete his BA (Hons) and then earned his doctorate at Harvard under Clarence Irving Lewis.

After a short teaching stint at Michigan, he taught at Swarthmore College from 1925 to 1944. He spent the remainder of his career at Yale University until his retirement in 1961. At Yale, he served as chairman of the Department of Philosophy for many years. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946 and the American Philosophical Society in 1948. In 1952, he delivered the Gifford Lectures in Scotland. In 1955 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Merton College.

In 1918, Blanshard married Frances Bradshaw, who would become dean of women at Swarthmore. It came as a great blow to him when Frances died in 1966. He completed her book &quot;Frank Aydelotte of Swarthmore&quot;, publishing it in 1970. In 1969, after what he later described as &quot;loneliness, failing health, and failing motives,&quot; he married Roberta Yerkes, a daughter of his Yale colleague Robert M. Yerkes. Brand Blanshard died in 1987 at the age of 95, in New Haven, Connecticut.

==Philosophical work==

Blanshard was a rationalist who espoused and defended a strong conception of reason during a century when reason came under attack in philosophy and psychology alike. He was also generally regarded as one of the last absolute idealists because he was strongly influenced by British idealism (especially F.H. Bradley and Bernard Bosanquet). However, this influence was felt primarily in his views concerning logic, values, and epistemology. He departed from absolute idealism in many respects, so much so that he explicitly disavowed being an idealist in an essay in &quot;The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard&quot; (in his reply to Charles Hartshorne). Blanshard sharply distinguished epistemological idealism (the position that all objects of direct experience exist only in consciousness) from ontological idealism (the position that the world in itself is mental, or made of mind-stuff). While he accepted epistemological idealism, he wasn&#x27;t prepared to take the extra step to ontological idealism, unlike Berkeley, Hegel, Royce, or Bosanquet. Rather, he thought it all but certain that the material world exists independently of mind and rejected the basic dictum of Berkeleian ontological idealism, that &quot;esse est percipi&quot; (to be is to be perceived).

Strongly critical of positivism, logical atomism, pragmatism, and most varieties of empiricism, he held that the universe consists of an Absolute in the form of a single all-encompassing intelligible system in which each element has a necessary place. Moreover, this Absolute—the universe as a whole—he held to be the only true &quot;particular&quot;, all elements within it being ultimately resoluble into specific &quot;universals&quot; (properties, relations, or combinations thereof that might be given identically in more than one context). He regarded his metaphysical monism as essentially a form of Spinozism.

Also strongly critical of reductionist accounts of mind (e.g., behaviorism), he maintained to the contrary that mind is the reality of which we are in fact &quot;most&quot; certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at truth, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of necessity: to understand (or explain) something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.

On Blanshard&#x27;s view, the Absolute is thus not merely consistent (i.e., noncontradictory) but positively coherent, shot through with relations of necessity and indeed operating purely deterministically. (Blanshard held the law of causality, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot &quot;prove&quot; that there are no atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, but we can take it as our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are always to be found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally.

In his early work &quot;The Nature of Thought&quot;, he defended a coherence theory of truth (though this is not the main thrust of that book, which, as the title makes explicit, is an essay in philosophical psychology). In his later years, however, he came to think that the relation between thought and object was &quot;sui generis&quot; and might be described, about equally inadequately, as either &quot;correspondence&quot; or &quot;coherence&quot;; at any rate, he admitted, the &quot;coherence&quot; between thought and its ideal object differs from the coherence that may obtain among thoughts. He also backed away from his early (more or less Bradleian) claim that the ultimate aim of thought was &quot;identification&quot; with its object.

He defended a strong doctrine of internal relations. He maintained, with longtime friend and philosophical colleague A.C. Ewing, that the doctrine would have caught on far better had it been more accurately described in terms of &quot;relevance&quot; rather than of &quot;internality&quot;. His doctrine on this point was that no relation is &quot;entirely&quot; irrelevant to the natures of the terms it relates, such relevance (and therefore &quot;internality&quot;) being a matter of degree. One of Blanshard&#x27;s most important exchanges on this topic was with philosopher Ernest Nagel, who attacked the doctrine of internal relations — indeed, Blanshard&#x27;s entire conception of reason — in his essay &quot;Sovereign Reason&quot;. Blanshard&#x27;s fullest published reply appears in his book &quot;Reason and Analysis&quot;.

Sympathetic to theism but skeptical of traditional religious and theological dogma, he did not regard his Absolute as having the characteristics of a personal God but nevertheless maintained that it was a proper subject of (rational) religious inquiry and even devotion. Defining &quot;religion&quot; as the dedication of one&#x27;s whole person to whatever one regards as true and important, he took as his own religion the service of reason in a very full and all-encompassing metaphysical sense, defending what he called the &quot;rational temper&quot; as a human ideal (though one exceedingly difficult to achieve in practice). His admiration for this temper extended his philosophical loyalties across &quot;party lines&quot;, especially to the one philosopher he regarded as exemplifying that temper to the greatest degree: Henry Sidgwick. (He also spoke highly of Bertrand Russell.) Theologically, Blanshard was raised Methodist but tended toward theological liberalism from an early age, a tendency that became more pronounced as he grew older. Beginning during his time at Swarthmore, he maintained a lifelong connection with the Religious Society of Friends despite personal disagreements with some of Quakerism&#x27;s generally accepted tenets (notably its pacifism).

In ethics, he was broadly utilitarian; however, he preferred the term &quot;teleological&quot; since the term &quot;utilitarian&quot; suggested that all goods were instrumental and he believed (with, e.g., H.W.B. Joseph and W.D. Ross) that some experiences were intrinsically good. He also denied that pleasure is the sole good, maintaining instead (with T.H. Green) that experiences are good as wholes and that pleasure is not, strictly speaking, a separable element within such wholes. Disagreeing with G.E. Moore that the &quot;naturalistic fallacy&quot; is really a fallacy, he gave an entirely naturalistic analysis of goodness, holding that an experience is intrinsically good to the degree that it (a) fulfills an impulse or drive and (b) generates a feeling-tone of satisfaction attendant upon such fulfillment. He regarded the first of these factors as by far the more important and held that the major intrinsic goods of human experience answer to the basic drives of human nature; he maintained that these two factors together provide not merely a criterion for but the actual meaning of intrinsic goodness. (He defined all other ethical terms, including &quot;right&quot;, in terms of intrinsic goodness, a right act, for example, being that act which tends to produce the greatest amount of intrinsic goodness under the relevant circumstances.)

The little that Blanshard wrote on political theory (mainly in &quot;Reason and Goodness&quot;) owed much to Green and Bosanquet. These two philosophers, he held, had rescued Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s confused doctrine of the general will and placed it on a rationally-defensible footing. Our &quot;real will&quot; (in Bosanquet&#x27;s terms) or &quot;rational will&quot; (in Blanshard&#x27;s) is simply that which we &quot;would&quot; want, all things considered, if our reflections upon what we presently desire were pursued to their ideal limit. Blanshard argued that there is excellent reason to regard this &quot;ideal&quot; will as in fact real, and contended that it provided the foundation for a rational political theory. The state is justified if, and precisely insofar as, it helps individual human beings to pursue and achieve the common end which is the object of their rational will. He did not develop this doctrine to the point of advocating any specific form of political organization or social structure, but in his Schilpp autobiography, he described an early sympathy for socialism and to having voted the &quot;straight Democratic ticket&quot; over the previous 40-odd years.

A firm believer in clarity of exposition, and himself one of the ablest writers of philosophical prose in the English language, he wrote a short book &quot;On Philosophical Style&quot; in defense of the view that philosophical profundity need not (and should not) be couched in obscurity and obfuscation. Both this book and his &quot;Reason and Analysis&quot; are probably best understood as complementary facets of his extensive work on metaphilosophy (never labeled as such). While Blanshard was a great admirer of the clarity and rigor of British analytical philosophy, which he saw as its best characteristic, he was appalled by what he regarded as the greatly shrunken scope of philosophy as conceived by both logical positivism and later &#x27;ordinary language&#x27; philosophy. His extraordinarily thorough and telling critique of these approaches in &quot;Reason and Analysis&quot; has profoundly therapeutic implications for how philosophy might be done, and the topics, including metaphysics, with which it may properly be concerned. However, his incisive critiques of Wittgenstein, Russell, and Moore, though almost superhumanly fair, placed him very much at odds with the main currents of Anglo-American philosophy. At the same time he was unsympathetic to what he saw as the anti-rationalism, and tendency to obscurantism, of Existentialism, which placed him at odds with some tendencies in Continental philosophy. Finally, his most ambitious book, &quot;The Nature of Thought&quot;, reached publication immediately before the outbreak of war, which severely limited the reception it received. In consequence of this, his oeuvre hasn&#x27;t achieved the recognition and influence it otherwise might have.

<doc id="568265" wikidata="Q6763686" url="?curid=568265" title="Marin Academy">
<text>Marin Academy (familiarly known as MA) is a private college preparatory high school in San Rafael, California. Located on the campus that for decades housed the San Rafael Military Academy prior to its closure, Marin Academy was founded in 1971 with 118 faculty members and a student body of 449.
Marin Academy is one of the most competitive private high schools in the Bay Area. In the 2015–2016 school year, Marin Academy accepted one in four students who applied.

==Curriculum==

MA requires students to take two years of one of its performing or visual arts programs, four years of English, three years of History, three years of Mathematics, three years of Science (Biology, Chemistry, and one Physics course are required), and two semesters of Human Development, a health and social awareness class. In addition to classroom instruction, Marin Academy students undertake a number of non-traditional learning experiences such as minicourse, the Outings program, end-of-year projects (EOY), wilderness quest, and mandatory senior speeches or senior arts performances. Another unique program is the Marin Academy Research Collaborative (MARC), where students conduct independent research during their junior and senior years. The student body sustains many socially conscious student organizations and has been active in politics in Marin. The school conducts annual conferences and workshops on equality and social justice, called the Conference on Democracy and has a tradition of seniors delivering speeches to school assemblies.

==Academics==
Marin Academy has a student-to-teacher ratio of 9:1 and an average class size of 15. More than two-thirds of the faculty hold advanced degrees. More than 99% of Marin Academy graduates go on to attend a four-year college or university.

Travis Brownley, an educator who was the dean of the Groton School, was appointed the Head of School in 2008 following the departure of the previous head of school, Bodie Brizendine, who had led the school for 12 years, and Dick Drew, who served as interim head of school. The Bodie Brizendine Leadership Center (BBLC), a centrally located building on campus, houses faculty offices, math classrooms, and the school cafeteria.

== Cheating scandal ==
Marin Academy was involved in the 2019 college cheating scandal &quot;varsity blues&quot; where parents cheated their children into colleges. Between two and three students from Marin Academy had parents who were involved including Todd and Diane Blake of Ross who pleaded guilty to the charges. Additionally, a member of Marin Academy&#x27;s board of trustees, William McGlashan, was accused of conspiring to bribe and commit mail fraud in relation to the scandal.

==Athletics==
Marin Academy has developed a strong athletics program, highlighted by successes in boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; soccer, cross country, boys&#x27; lacrosse, boys&#x27; water polo, and girls&#x27; volleyball. The school competes in The Bay Counties League (BCL) within the North Coast Section (NCS). During the COVID era, the swimming and water polo teams were members of The Marin County Athletic League (MCAL).

Marin Academy has won 11 North Coast Section championships in boys&#x27; soccer - 2000, 2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022 - and is a regular contender for regional championships. Girls&#x27; varsity soccer won the BCL and placed second in the North Coast Section Championship, losing to the Branson High School 4–2, in 2002. In 2006, the boys&#x27; soccer team won their third NCS championship in a match against University High School. Tied 1-1 through overtime, the NCS championship game was decided by penalty kicks, in which MA won 5–4. MA also defeated University in the BCL finals that year. In 2007, MA and University again matched up in the BCL and NCS championships, with UHS winning BCL and MA winning NCS 2–0. In 2008 MA and University were matched up once again in the BCL final and the Wildcats defeated the Devils 2–0. The two schools are rivals.

The girls&#x27; soccer team has won the last 6 BCL titles from 2016 to 2022 (undefeated against league opponents in the last 4 seasons) as well as ones in 2002 and 2010. In 2019 and in 2020 they advanced to NCS finals against Cardinal Newman and to CIF finals against Branson, coming up a goal short in 3 of the games and a penalty kick in the other. In 2022 MA girls soccer won their first NCS title and in 2023, they won their first Norcal Championship.

The girls&#x27; volleyball team won the state and NCS division V championships in 2004, after losing to University High School in both the NCS and Northern California championship games the year before. In the 2022 fall season the team won the NCS title.

In the 2012 spring season, the Girls&#x27; Varsity Swim Team set the first North Coast Section record in Marin Academy history, with a time of 1:34.82 in the 200 yard freestyle relay. The girls placed fifth overall at NCS, first out of Marin County teams, and first out of schools with fewer than one thousand students.

The Marin Academy boys&#x27; water polo team placed first in NCS DII in 2017 after defeating Alameda High School 13–8. In both 2021 and 2022 the team placed second in NCS DII. In 2024, they again placed first in NCS DII after defeating Cardinal Newman in the championship game.

The Marin Academy Cross Country team placed first in NCS DII in 2015 and placed second in the California State Championships D V in both 2013 and 2015.

<doc id="568270" wikidata="Q1630448" url="?curid=568270" title="John Dean">
<text>John Wesley Dean III (born October 14, 1938) is a disbarred American attorney who served as White House Counsel for U.S. President Richard Nixon from July 1970 until April 1973. Dean is known for his role in the cover-up of the Watergate scandal and his subsequent testimony to Congress as a witness. His guilty plea to a single felony in exchange for becoming a key witness for the prosecution ultimately resulted in a reduced sentence, which he served at Fort Holabird outside Baltimore, Maryland. After his plea, he was disbarred.

Shortly after the Watergate hearings, Dean wrote about his experiences in a series of books and toured the United States to lecture. He later became a commentator on contemporary politics, a book author, and a columnist for FindLaw&#x27;s &quot;Writ&quot;.

Dean had originally been a proponent of Goldwater conservatism, but he later became a critic of the Republican Party. Dean has been particularly critical of the party&#x27;s support of Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump, and of neoconservatism, strong executive power, mass surveillance, and the Iraq War.

==Early life and education==
Dean was born in Akron, Ohio, and lived in Marion, the hometown of the 29th President of the United States, Warren Harding, whose biographer he later became. His family moved to Flossmoor, Illinois, where he attended grade school. For high school, he attended Staunton Military Academy with Barry Goldwater Jr., the son of Sen. Barry Goldwater, and became a close friend of the family. He attended Colgate University and then transferred to the College of Wooster in Ohio, where he obtained his B.A. in 1961. He received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1965.

Dean married Karla Ann Hennings, the daughter of Senator Thomas C. Hennings Jr. of Missouri, on February 4, 1962; they had one child, John Wesley Dean IV, before divorcing in 1970. Dean married Maureen (Mo) Kane on October 13, 1972.

==Washington lawyer==
After graduation, Dean joined Welch &amp; Morgan, a law firm in Washington, D.C., where he was soon accused of conflict of interest violations and fired: he was alleged to have started negotiating his own private deal for a TV station broadcast license, after his firm had assigned him to complete the same task for a client.

Dean was employed from 1966 to 1967 as chief minority counsel to the Republicans on the United States House Committee on the Judiciary. Dean then served as associate director of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws for approximately two years.

==Nixon campaign and administration==
Dean volunteered to write position papers on crime for Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1968. The following year, he became an associate deputy in the office of the Attorney General of the United States, serving under Attorney General John N. Mitchell, with whom he was on friendly terms. In July 1970, he accepted an appointment to serve as counsel to the president, after the previous holder of this post, Chuck Colson, became the president&#x27;s director of the Office of Public Liaison.

==Watergate scandal==
===Start of Watergate===

On January 27, 1972, Dean, the White House Counsel, met with Jeb Magruder (Deputy Director of the Committee to Re-Elect the President, or CRP and CREEP) and Mitchell (Attorney General of the United States, and soon-to-be Director of CRP), in Mitchell&#x27;s office, for a presentation by G. Gordon Liddy (counsel for CRP and a former FBI agent). Liddy presented a preliminary plan for intelligence-gathering operations during the campaign. Reaction to Liddy&#x27;s plan was highly unfavorable. Liddy was ordered to scale down his ideas, and he presented a revised plan to the same group on February 4, which was also left unapproved.

In late March in Florida, Mitchell approved a scaled-down plan. This revised plan eventually led to attempts to eavesdrop on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., and to the Watergate scandal. The burglars&#x27; first break-in attempt in late May was successful, but several problems had arisen with poor-quality information from their bugs, and they wanted to photograph more documents. Specifically, the burglars were interested in information they thought was held by DNC head Lawrence F. O&#x27;Brien. On their second break-in, on the night of June 16, hotel security discovered the burglars. After the burglars&#x27; arrest, Dean took custody of evidence and money from the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt, who had been in charge of the burglaries, and destroyed some of the evidence before investigators could find it.

===Link to cover-up===
On February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his nomination to replace J. Edgar Hoover as director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the White House had possession of FBI Watergate files, committee chair Sam Ervin asked Gray what he knew about the White House obtaining the files. Gray said he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also came out that Gray had destroyed important evidence Dean entrusted to him. Gray&#x27;s nomination failed and Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.

White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman later claimed that Nixon appointed Dean to take the lead role in coordinating the Watergate cover-up from an early stage and that this cover-up was working very well for many months. Certain aspects of the scandal came to light before Election Day, but Nixon was reelected by a landslide.

===Cooperation with prosecutors===
On March 22, 1973, Nixon requested that Dean put together a report with everything he knew about the Watergate matter, inviting him to take a retreat to Camp David to do so. Dean went to Camp David and did some work on a report, but since he was one of the cover-up&#x27;s chief participants, the task put him in the difficult position of relating his own involvement as well as that of others; he correctly concluded that higher-ups were fitting him for the role of scapegoat. Dean did not complete the report.

On March 23, the five Watergate burglars, along with G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt, were sentenced with stiff fines and prison time of up to 40 years.

On April 6, Dean hired an attorney and began cooperating with Senate Watergate investigators, while continuing to work as Nixon&#x27;s Chief White House Counsel and participating in cover-up efforts, not disclosing this obvious conflict to Nixon until some time later. Dean was also receiving advice from the attorney he hired, Charles Shaffer, on matters involving the vulnerabilities of other White House staff.

Dean continued to provide information to the prosecutors, who were able to make enormous progress on the cover-up, which until then they had virtually ignored, concentrating on the actual burglary and events preceding it. Dean also appeared before the Watergate grand jury, where he took the Fifth Amendment numerous times to avoid incriminating himself, and in order to save his testimony for the Senate Watergate hearings.

===Firing by Nixon===

Coupled with his sense of distance from Nixon&#x27;s inner circle, the &quot;Berlin Wall&quot; of advisors Haldeman and Ehrlichman, Dean sensed he was going to become the Watergate scapegoat and returned to Washington without completing his report. Nixon fired Dean on April 30, the same day he announced the resignations of Haldeman and Ehrlichman.

When Nixon learned that Dean had begun cooperating with federal prosecutors, he pressed Attorney General Richard Kleindienst not to give Dean immunity from prosecution by telling Kleindienst that Dean was lying to the Justice Department about his conversations with the president. On April 17, 1973, Nixon told Assistant Attorney General Henry Petersen (who was overseeing the Watergate investigation) that he did not want any member of the White House granted immunity from prosecution. Petersen informed Nixon that this could cause problems for the prosecution of the case, but Nixon publicly announced his position that evening. It was alleged that Nixon&#x27;s motivation for preventing Dean from getting immunity was to prevent him from testifying against key Nixon aides and Nixon himself.

===Testimony to Senate Watergate Committee===

On June 25, 1973, Dean began his testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee. The committee had voted to grant him use immunity (doing so in a divided vote in a private session that was then changed to a unanimous vote and announced that way to the public). In his testimony, he implicated administration officials, including Mitchell, Nixon, and himself. His testimony attracted very high television ratings since he was breaking new ground in the investigation, and media attention grew apace, with more detailed newspaper coverage. Dean was the first administration official to accuse Nixon of direct involvement with Watergate and the resulting cover-up in press interviews.

====Research on accuracy of Dean&#x27;s memory====
When it was revealed that Nixon had secretly recorded all meetings in the Oval Office, famous psychologist and memory researcher Ulric Neisser analyzed Dean&#x27;s recollections of the meetings, as expressed through his testimony, in comparison to the meetings&#x27; actual recordings. A sharp critic of studying memory in a laboratory setting, Neisser saw &quot;a valuable data trove&quot; in Dean&#x27;s recall.

Neisser found that, despite Dean&#x27;s confidence, the tapes proved that his memory was anything but a tape recorder. Dean failed to recall any conversations verbatim, and often failed to recall the gist of conversations correctly. Neisser did not explain the difference as one of deception; rather, he thought that the evidence supported the theory that memory is not akin to a tape recorder and instead should be thought of as reconstructions of information that are greatly affected by rehearsal, or attempts at replay.

===Criminal trial===
Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice before Watergate trial judge John Sirica on October 19, 1973. He admitted supervising payments of &quot;hush money&quot; to the Watergate burglars, notably E. Howard Hunt, and revealed the existence of Nixon&#x27;s enemies list. Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was interested in meeting with Dean and planned to do so a few days later, but Cox was fired by Nixon the next day; it was not until a month later that Cox was replaced by Leon Jaworski. On August 2, 1974, Sirica handed down a sentence to Dean of one to four years in a minimum-security prison. But when Dean surrendered as scheduled on September 3, he was diverted to the custody of U.S. Marshals and kept instead at Fort Holabird (near Baltimore, Maryland) in a special &quot;safe house&quot; primarily used for witnesses against the Mafia. He spent his days at the offices of Jaworski, the Watergate Special Prosecutor, and testifying in the trial of Watergate conspirators Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Robert Mardian, and Kenneth Parkinson, which concluded in December. All except Parkinson were convicted, largely based upon Dean&#x27;s evidence. Dean&#x27;s lawyer moved to have his sentence reduced and on January 8, Sirica granted the motion, adjusting Dean&#x27;s sentence to time served, which was four months. With his plea to felony offenses, Dean was disbarred as a lawyer in Virginia and the District of Columbia.

==Life after Watergate==

===Investment banker===
Shortly after Watergate, Dean became an investment banker, author and lecturer based in Beverly Hills, California. He chronicled his White House experiences, with a focus on Watergate, in the memoirs &quot;Blind Ambition&quot; (1976) and &quot;Lost Honor&quot; (1982). &quot;Blind Ambition&quot; was ghostwritten by future Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Taylor Branch and later made into a 1979 TV miniseries.

In 1992, Dean hired attorney Neil Papiano and brought the first in a series of defamation suits against G. Gordon Liddy for claims in Liddy&#x27;s book &quot;Will&quot; and St. Martin&#x27;s Press for its publication of the book &quot;Silent Coup&quot; by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin. &quot;Silent Coup&quot; alleged that Dean masterminded the Watergate burglaries and the Watergate coverup and that the true aim of the burglaries was to seize information implicating Dean and the former Maureen &quot;Mo&quot; Biner (his then-fiancée) in a prostitution ring. After hearing of Colodny&#x27;s work, Liddy issued a revised paperback version of &quot;Will&quot; supporting Colodny&#x27;s theory. This theory was subsequently the subject of the 1992 A&amp;E Network &quot;Investigative Reports&quot; series program &quot;The Key to Watergate&quot;.

In the preface to his 2006 book &quot;Conservatives Without Conscience&quot;, Dean strongly denied Colodny&#x27;s theory, pointing out that Colodny&#x27;s chief source (Phillip Mackin Bailley) had been in and out of mental institutions. Dean settled the defamation suit against Colodny and his publisher, St. Martin&#x27;s Press, on terms that Dean wrote in the book&#x27;s preface he could not divulge under the conditions of the settlement, other than that &quot;the Deans were satisfied.&quot; The case of Dean vs. Liddy was dismissed without prejudice. Also in 2006, Dean appeared as an interviewee in the documentary &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon&quot;, about the Nixon administration&#x27;s efforts to keep John Lennon out of the United States.

Dean retired from investment banking in 2000 while continuing to work as an author and lecturer, becoming a columnist for FindLaw&#x27;s &quot;Writ&quot; online magazine.

===Watergate comments===
In 2001, Dean published &quot;The Rehnquist Choice: The Untold Story of the Nixon Appointment that Redefined the Supreme Court&quot;, an exposé of the White House&#x27;s selection process for a new Supreme Court justice in 1971, which led to the appointment of William Rehnquist. He resides in Beverly Hills, California.

In 2008, Dean co-edited &quot;Pure Goldwater,&quot; a collection of writings by the 1964 Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, in part as an act of fealty to the man who defined his political ideals. His co-editor was Goldwater&#x27;s son Barry Goldwater, Jr.

Historian Stanley Kutler was accused of editing his transcripts of the Nixon tapes to make Dean appear in a more favorable light.

On September 17, 2009, Dean appeared on &quot;Countdown&quot; with new allegations about Watergate. He said he had found information via the Nixon tapes that showed what the burglars were after: information on a kickback scheme involving the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida. Dean also asserts that Nixon did not directly order the break-in, but that Ehrlichman ordered it on Nixon&#x27;s behalf.

In speaking engagements in 2014, Dean called Watergate a &quot;lawyers&#x27; scandal&quot; that, for all the bad, ushered in needed legal ethics reforms.

===Criticism of George W. Bush===
In 2004, Dean wrote a book heavily critical of the administration of George W. Bush, &quot;Worse than Watergate&quot;, in which he called for the impeachment of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for allegedly lying to Congress.

His next book, released in 2006, was &quot;Conservatives without Conscience&quot;, a play on Barry Goldwater&#x27;s book &quot;The Conscience of a Conservative&quot;. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically on the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, in stark contrast to Goldwater&#x27;s philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer&#x27;s scholarly work, he contends that there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are in power and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich and Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by the Republican Congress and on the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support of the Republican Party, as a result of the obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.

After it became known that Bush authorized NSA wiretaps without warrants, Dean asserted that Bush is &quot;the first President to admit to an impeachable offense&quot;. On March 31, 2006, Dean testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during hearings on censuring Bush over the issue. Senator Russell Feingold, who sponsored the censure resolution, introduced Dean as a &quot;patriot&quot; who put &quot;rule of law above the interests of the president.&quot; In his testimony, Dean asserted that Nixon covered up Watergate because he believed it was in the interest of national security. This sparked a sharp debate with Republican South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, who repeatedly asserted that Nixon authorized the break-in at Democratic headquarters. Dean finally replied, &quot;You&#x27;re showing you don&#x27;t know that subject very well.&quot; Spectators laughed, and soon the senator was &quot;sputtering mad&quot;.

Dean&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;Broken Government: How Republican Rule Destroyed the Legislative, Executive and Judicial Branches&quot; is, as he wrote in its introduction, the third volume of an unplanned trilogy. In this latest book, Dean, who has repeatedly called himself a &quot;Goldwater conservative&quot;, built on &quot;Worse Than Watergate&quot; and &quot;Conservatives Without Conscience&quot; to argue that the Republican Party has gravely damaged all three branches of the federal government in the service of ideological rigidity and with no attention to the public interest or the general good. Dean concludes that conservatism must regenerate itself to remain true to its core ideals of limited government and the rule of law.

===Criticism of Donald Trump===
Dean later emerged as a strong critic of Donald Trump, saying in 2017 that he was even worse than Nixon. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s a nightmare. They don&#x27;t know what their jeopardy is. They don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re looking at. They don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re a part of a conspiracy that might unfold. They don&#x27;t know whether to hire lawyers or not, how they&#x27;re going to pay for them if they do. It&#x27;s an unpleasant place.&quot;

In February 2018, Dean warned that Rick Gates&#x27;s testimony may be &quot;the end&quot; of Trump&#x27;s presidency.

In September 2018, Dean warned against Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s confirmation to the United States Supreme Court, a main concern being that the appointment would result in &quot;the most presidential-powers-friendly court&quot; in modern times.

On November 7, 2018, the day after the midterm elections, Trump forced Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign. Dean commented on the removal in colorful terms, saying it &quot;seems to be planned like a murder&quot; and that Special Counsel Robert Mueller likely had contingency plans, possibly including sealed indictments.
In early June 2019, Dean testified, along with various U.S. attorneys and legal experts, before the House Judiciary Committee on the implications of, and potential actions as a result of, the Mueller report.

In 2022, Dean said the January 6 Committee had an overwhelming case against Trump. In 2024, Dean said the &quot;Trump v. United States&quot; ruling essentially affirms Nixon&#x27;s famous statement during the Nixon interviews: &quot;When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.&quot; Dean said Nixon &quot;would have survived&quot; the Watergate scandal under the ruling &quot;because the evidence against him was based on official acts the Supreme Court has deemed immune from prosecution.&quot; Dean called the ruling “a radical decision by a radical court” and “judicial activism on steroids.” Dean elaborated his thoughts on the ruling:
“Well, there’s actually two rulings in this decision. There’s a 6-3 for presumptive immunity, but there’s also a 5-4 on you can’t even have the evidence of official conduct come to play… This is very…this to me, appears to certainly influence the existing law on presidential conduct [and] what’s available…evidentiary speaking. Amy Coney Barrett said she didn’t think that it should be so restricted as the decision of the court itself was, so I think that Nixon would have survived. I think he would have walked under this ruling.”

Dean had previously said Nixon would have survived that same scandal if Fox News had existed during that time (1970s). He said:
“I think there’s more likelihood (Nixon) might have survived if there’d been a Fox News.”

==Media appearances and portrayals==
Dean frequently served as a guest on the former MSNBC and Current TV news program, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, and &quot;The Randi Rhodes Show&quot; on Premiere Radio Networks.

In the 1979 TV mini-series &quot;Blind Ambition&quot;, Dean was played by Martin Sheen. In the 1995 film &quot;Nixon&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone, Dean was played by David Hyde Pierce. In the 1999 film &quot;Dick&quot;, Dean was played by Jim Breuer. In the 2022 TV mini-series &quot;Gaslit&quot;, Dean was played by Dan Stevens. In the 2023 TV mini-series &quot;White House Plumbers&quot;, Dean was played by Domhnall Gleeson.

<text>Interflug [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] (; ) was the national airline of East Germany (officially the “German Democratic Republic”) from 1963 to 1991. Based in East Berlin, it operated scheduled and chartered flights to European and intercontinental destinations out of its hub at Berlin Schönefeld Airport, focusing on Comecon countries. Interflug also had significant crop dusting operations. Following German reunification, the company was liquidated.

==History==
===Founding years===

Until 1945, Deutsche Luft Hansa had served as German flag carrier. Following the end of World War II and the subsequent allied occupation of Germany, all aircraft in the country were seized and the airline was liquidated. In 1954, a West German company acquired the &quot;Lufthansa&quot; trademark. In 1955, Deutsche Lufthansa was founded as a rival East German flag carrier. It soon became obvious that the East German airline would likely lose a lawsuit over the use of the &quot;Lufthansa&quot; branding. As a result, Interflug was set up on 18 September 1958 as a &quot;backup&quot; company, initially intended to complement the East German aviation industry by operating chartered flights. In 1963, the East German Lufthansa was liquidated, officially due to poor profitability (though this step foreclosed the imminent stripping of the &quot;Lufthansa&quot; name). Its staff, aircraft fleet, and route network were transferred to Interflug, which henceforth served as the East German flag carrier.

===East German national airline===
As a state-owned airline, Interflug and its approximately 8,000 employees were under the control of the National Defense Council, in supreme command of the East German armed forces. The majority of Interflug pilots were reserve officers of the National People&#x27;s Army (and as such were required to be members of the Socialist Unity Party), and its aircraft could be requisitioned for military purposes at any time. Klaus Henkes, who became General Director of the airline in 1978, had previously served as General of the East German Air Force. Applicants for flight attendant jobs had to be approved of by the Stasi, which assessed their &quot;political reliability&quot;, in an attempt to minimize espionage and defection to Western countries. Interflug crews who associated with employees of airlines from non-socialist countries risked suspension. Each flight crew was assigned a political officer who gave political lectures during flights.

The airline&#x27;s route network and fleet of Soviet-built aircraft grew significantly in the 1960s. The Ilyushin Il-18 turboprop airliner became the workhorse of Interflug&#x27;s short-haul flights during that period. The company had been the intended primary operator of the Baade 152, an early jet airliner constructed in East Germany. Its development never went beyond the prototype phase and was abandoned in 1961. In 1969, the Tupolev Tu-134 was introduced, the first jet airliner operated by Interflug, used on European routes. The long-range Il-62 joined the fleet in 1971. That same year, the number of Interflug passengers reached 1 million. At its peak, Interflug flew to destinations such as Havana, Cuba, Singapore and Conakry, Guinea.

As a result of the 1970s energy crisis and increasing fuel prices, Interflug gradually dismantled its domestic route network. The last scheduled domestic flight, to transport prisoners from East Berlin to Erfurt, took place in April 1980.

===Late 1980s and German reunification===
During the 1980s, Interflug&#x27;s aging fleet caused increasing difficulties: fuel efficiency was inferior to that of contemporary western airliners, and noise pollution regulations meant the airline had to pay higher landing fees and was even banned from operating at some airports. With some exceptions, Western-built airliners (most notably those produced by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus) could not be delivered to Soviet bloc countries because of the CoCom embargo. Following a deal between Boeing and LOT Polish Airlines for the purchase of six Boeing 767 aircraft, and in order to acknowledge the Perestroika movement, commercial airliners were exempted from the trade embargo in 1988. Malév Hungarian Airlines also bought Boeing aircraft in 1988, and later that year, Interflug placed an order for three Airbus A310 long-haul aircraft, worth DM 420 million. The deal was secured with the support of Franz Josef Strauss, then Minister-President of Bavaria, chairman of the Airbus supervisory board and responsible for West German loans to East Germany.

The first Airbus A310 was delivered to Interflug on 26 June 1989. The East German crews for the new aircraft type were trained in West Germany; aircraft maintenance was also performed there. The A310 enabled non-stop flights to Cuba (flights had previously required a fuel stop at Gander International Airport in Canada).

Following the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and the subsequent political upheaval in East Germany, several airlines expressed interest in buying parts of the highly unprofitable company to secure a share of the German air traffic market, especially in Berlin. In early March 1990, Lufthansa signed a letter of intent to acquire 26 percent of Interflug, but the offer was blocked by Germany&#x27;s Federal Cartel Office. Plans for a takeover by British Airways did not materialize either (the UK airline instead founded Deutsche BA in 1992). On 1 July 1990, Interflug became a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

As a consequence of German reunification on 3 October 1990, Interflug came under the administration of the &quot;Treuhandanstalt&quot;, along with all other East German state property. As no buyers could be found, the liquidation of Interflug, which had 2,900 employees and 20 aircraft at the time, was announced on 7 February 1991. The airline was then dismantled. The last commercial flight (on the Berlin-Vienna-Berlin route, using a Tu-134) took place on 30 April 1991.

==Legacy==
Following the liquidation, a group of former Interflug employees acquired five of the company&#x27;s Ilyushin Il-18 airliners and set up Il-18 Air Cargo, which soon became known as &quot;Berline&quot;, operating chartered cargo and leisure flights out of Schönefeld Airport. The company went bankrupt and ceased operations in 1994.

The three Airbus A310 purchased by Interflug in 1988 were handed over by the &quot;Treuhandanstalt&quot; to the Federal Republic of Germany and became part of the German Air Force, used for VIP transport of high-ranking politicians like the German president or chancellor.

Several former Interflug aircraft have been preserved in different places in Germany.

==Route network==


As the national airline of East Germany from 1963 to 1991, Interflug operated scheduled passenger flights to the following destinations.


===Flights to Western countries===

As an East German state-owned company, Interflug had the important role of securing foreign currency reserves, as the East German mark was considered a weak currency. For most of its existence, Interflug was not a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and could therefore significantly undercut the ticket prices of other European carriers. From the 1970s, more effort was put into operating chartered flights to Mediterranean and Black Sea holiday resorts, many of which specifically catered to West Germans. (Travel restrictions applied to East Germans). Starting in that period, Interflug gained traffic rights to several destinations in Western Europe. All these flights could be booked at travel agencies in West Berlin and West Germany, which had signed sale contracts with Interflug. To simplify the transfer of passengers from West Berlin to and from Schönefeld Airport, a dedicated border crossing checkpoint was inaugurated at &quot;Waltersdorfer Chaussee&quot;, and scheduled shuttle buses were operated from the Central Bus Terminal in the Westend locality.

By the early 1980s, low Interflug ticket prices led to a severe decline in holiday flights at Berlin Tegel Airport in West Berlin. Pilots at Pan Am, which had a hub at Tegel, reportedly considered operating flights to Greece without pay to allow the airline to compete with Interflug.

Interflug signed an agreement with Turkish Airlines giving the two airlines exclusive rights to offer dedicated flights for Turkish &quot;Gastarbeiter&quot; to and from West Germany and West Berlin. In the 1980s, Interflug set up a partnership with KLM for a joint operation on the East Berlin-Amsterdam route. Of the six weekly flights, two were operated by KLM&#x27;s Fokker F28 Fellowships, and four by Interflug&#x27;s Tu-134s and Il-62s. As neither airline was allowed to cross the intra-German border, the KLM flights were routed via Denmark, and Interflug used a southern routing over Czechoslovakia.

During the annual Leipzig Trade Fair, at that time considered the most important meeting place for businesspeople and politicians from both sides of the Iron Curtain, Lufthansa and Interflug were granted special permits to operate flights between Leipzig and West Germany. In 1986, Lufthansa and Interflug applied for joint traffic rights for year-round scheduled intra-German flights over the Iron Curtain, which were initially rejected by the Western Allies (likely due to concerns that their unique market position for flights to and from Berlin might be weakened), and only granted in August 1989. Interflug was then able to launch flights on the Leipzig-Düsseldorf route, while Lufthansa began serving the Frankfurt-Leipzig leg. In 1990, Interflug added flights from Dresden to Hamburg and Cologne.

==Fleet==

Over the years, Interflug operated the following aircraft types on its commercial flights:

==Accidents and incidents==
===Fatal===
*On 26 July 1964, an Interflug Antonov An-2 (registered DM-SKS) crashed near Magdeburg; the two occupants died.
*The Königs Wusterhausen air disaster, the deadliest to date in Germany with 156 fatalities (and second-deadliest in the world at the time, only surpassed by All Nippon Airways Flight 58) occurred on 14 August 1972, when an Interflug Ilyushin Il-62 (registered DM-SEA), then one of the world&#x27;s largest passenger jets, crashed during an emergency landing attempt near Schönefeld Airport. The aircraft, registered DM-SEA, was the first Il-62 operated by Interflug. Shortly into the Berlin-Burgas flight, the aircrew encountered problems with the elevators caused by a fire in the cargo bay, which destroyed part of the rear fuselage. The aircrew subsequently tried to return to the airport, ultimately sending the airplane into an uncontrolled descent.
*On 1 September 1975, an Interflug Tupolev Tu-134 (registered DM-SCD) crashed during its approach into Leipzig/Halle Airport; 27 of the 34 people on board died (three crew and four passengers survived). The aircraft had been travelling from Stuttgart, West Germany, to Leipzig (such flights were only operated during the Leipzig Trade Fair). It was later determined that the pilots had not properly checked the aircraft&#x27;s altitude, leading to a descent below the glide slope and a collision with an antenna mast.
*On 26 March 1979, a cargo-configured Interflug Ilyushin Il-18 (registered DM-STL) overshot the runway at Luanda Airport in Angola following an engine failure during the take-off run. The aircraft broke up and erupted into flames; all ten people on board died.
*On 17 June 1989, an Ilyushin Il-62 (registered DDR-SEW) operating Interflug Flight 102 to Moscow overshot the runway during a take-off attempt at Schönefeld Airport and caught fire; 21 of the 103 passengers on board and one person on the ground died (all ten crew members survived). The accident started when a rudder jammed because of a locking tab that had been left in place during maintenance. When instructed to apply reverse thrust, the flight engineer mistakenly switched the engines off. Because the accident occurred on the anniversary of the 1953 East German uprising, the resulting tense atmosphere in the GDR initially led to suspicions of sabotage, delaying medical assistance to survivors.

===Non-fatal===
*On 7 December 1963, an Interflug Ilyushin Il-14 (registered DM-SBL) belly-landed near Königsbrück following total electrical failure; all 33 on board survived.
*On 22 November 1977, an Interflug Tu-134 (registered DM-SCM) on a flight from Moscow was damaged beyond repair in a landing accident at Schönefeld Airport. The aircraft, with 74 people aboard, crashed into the runway due to an excessive sink rate caused by faulty handling of the autopilot.
*On 11 February 1991, Interflug&#x27;s scheduled Berlin-Moscow flight was involved in a go-around incident at Sheremetyevo Airport. The captain of the Airbus A310 (registered D-AOAC) disagreed with the flight computer settings for the go-around, and the resulting opposite control inputs from the flight computer caused a total of four stalls, including one that pitched the aircraft up to 88 degrees (nearly vertical). The pilots eventually recovered control and landed the aircraft. Taking place after the crash of an Airbus A320 during a 1988 demonstration flight, the incident further demonstrated the danger of aircrews inadvertently or deliberately countermanding automatic safety protocols built into modern jetliners.

===Criminal incidents===
*On 10 March 1970, a hijacking attempt occurred on an Interflug flight from East Berlin to Leipzig. Armed with pistols, a young husband and wife, Eckhard and Christel Wehage, demanded the pilot fly the Antonov An-24 – which had 15 other passengers on board – to Hanover in West Germany to escape the Iron Curtain. The pilot claimed not to have enough fuel, and the Wehages agreed to fly to Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin. The plane returned to Schönefeld Airport instead, leading the Wehages to kill themselves.
*A similar hijacking attempt failed during an Interflug flight from Erfurt to East Berlin on 30 January 1980. 
*On 20 December 1980, Interflug Flight 302 from East Berlin to Budapest was subjected to a bomb threat. En route, a handwritten note was discovered claiming a bomb was hidden on the Tupolev Tu-134 and would be triggered once the aircraft descended below . The crew decided to divert to Poprad, a Czechoslovak airport located at an elevation of . Upon landing a backpack was discovered which did not belong to any of the passengers. No information was released about its contents.

==In popular culture==
*The East German TV series &quot;Treffpunkt Flughafen&quot; was produced between 1985 and 1986. In eight episodes, it deals with the fictional crew of an Interflug Ilyushin Il-62, and their (often negative) experiences and adventures in foreign countries, which the average East German citizen could either not afford or was not allowed to travel to.
*The intentional landing of a former Interflug Ilyushin Il-62 on a long grass runway in Gollenberg on 23 October 1989 received widespread media attention. The aircraft, donated by the airline, was commanded by and has been preserved there ever since to commemorate aviation pioneer Otto Lilienthal.

==InterCondor==
*After West and East Germany reunited, Interflug with Condor Flugdienst planned to start a joint-venture airline named InterCondor. InterCondor&#x27;s fleet was to consist only of Boeing 757s. Unfortunately, due to the liquidation of Interflug in 1990, the project airline was abandoned.

<doc id="568296" wikidata="Q735091" url="?curid=568296" title="Six Feet Under (band)">
<text>Six Feet Under is an American death metal band from Tampa, Florida, formed in 1993. 

The band is currently composed of founding vocalist Chris Barnes, bassist Jeff Hughell, drummer Marco Pitruzzella, and guitarists Ray Suhy and Jack Owen. It was originally a side project formed by Barnes with guitarist Allen West of Obituary, but became a full-time commitment after Barnes was dismissed from Cannibal Corpse in 1995. Six Feet Under has released 14 albums, and is listed by Nielsen Soundscan as the fourth-best-selling death metal act in the U.S.

==History==

===Formation, &quot;Haunted&quot;, and &quot;Warpath&quot; (1993–1997)===
After Barnes and West joined forces, they recruited Terry Butler, who knew West from his involvement with Massacre, and Greg Gall, Terry Butler&#x27;s brother-in-law. Six Feet Under first played in 1993 at clubs, performing mostly cover songs. The band began writing original material in the middle of 1994. Because Barnes was already signed to Metal Blade Records with Cannibal Corpse, Six Feet Under signed to this label and became a side project.

Their first album, &quot;Haunted&quot;, was released on September 1, 1995. &quot;Haunted&quot; was produced by Brian Slagel (who discovered Slayer) and Scott Burns (record producer) (who worked with Napalm Death, Sepultura, Deicide, among others). By this point, Chris Barnes had made Six Feet Under his main priority. In 1995, in the process of recording the album Vile, he was fired by Cannibal Corpse because he chose to go on a European tour with Six Feet Under instead of recording vocals for &quot;Created To Kill&quot; and was replaced by Monstrosity&#x27;s, George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher

Six Feet Under&#x27;s next release was the &quot;Alive and Dead&quot; EP on October 29, 1996. A dual studio/live EP, it contains three studio recordings (&quot;Insect&quot;, &quot;Drowning&quot;, and a Judas Priest cover, &quot;Grinder&quot;) and four tracks from &quot;Haunted&quot; performed live. The band released their second studio album, &quot;Warpath&quot;, on September 9, 1997, and would incorporate blends of death metal and death n roll. It would also be the last album to feature Allen West, who would depart shortly after the album&#x27;s release.

===&quot;Maximum Violence&quot; and &quot;Graveyard Classics&quot; (1998–2000)===
In 1998, Allen West left to rejoin Obituary and was replaced by Steve Swanson. This is the only lineup change that the band had until January 2011. Combined with Barnes&#x27; departure from Cannibal Corpse, the arrival of Swanson helped turn Six Feet Under from a mere side-project to a band in its own right.

July 13, 1999 saw the release of Six Feet Under&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Maximum Violence&quot;. The band also recorded a death-metal retooling of the Kiss song &quot;War Machine&quot;, which would be featured on the album&#x27;s tracklist. There were also covers of the Iron Maiden song &quot;Wrathchild&quot; and the Thin Lizzy song &quot;Jailbreak.&quot;

During the summer of 2000, Six Feet Under participated in the Vans Warped Tour, a festival that, at the time, usually featured punk rock bands.

Further pursuing their interest in cover songs, Six Feet Under released an album entirely of covers, &quot;Graveyard Classics&quot;, on October 24, 2000. The songs were given death metal and death n roll makeovers in regards to the timbre of the vocals and instruments, but the original riffs and rhythms of the songs were left intact. Songs include Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot;, Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;, and Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Purple Haze&quot;.

===&quot;True Carnage&quot; and &quot;Bringer of Blood&quot; (2001–2003)===
The group&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;True Carnage&quot; (August 7, 2001), was also their first recording to feature guest artists: Ice-T raps while Barnes roars on &quot;One Bullet Left&quot;, and Karyn Crisis joins Barnes for &quot;Sick and Twisted&quot;. &quot;True Carnage&quot; peaked on the Billboard Heatseeker&#x27;s charts at number 18.

Six Feet Under undertook a lengthy bout of American tours, commencing in the summer of 2002, with supporters Skinless and Sworn Enemy. Their June 14 performance was recorded for a DVD and live album release, &quot;Double Dead Redux&quot;. September 2002 saw the band touring with Hatebreed. Around Christmas 2002, they participated in some European festivals with bands such as Kataklysm and Dying Fetus.

The band next released &quot;Bringer of Blood&quot;, on September 23, 2003. In addition to his trademark guttural vocals, Barnes also began using higher pitched pig squeal vocals on this release.

===&quot;Graveyard Classics 2&quot;, &quot;13&quot;, and &quot;A Decade in the Grave&quot; (2004–2006)===
&quot;Graveyard Classics 2&quot; came out on October 19, 2004. This cover album focused solely on the 1980 AC/DC album &quot;Back in Black&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Wade Kergan remarked that the death metal-makeover on these forefather songs &quot;are equal parts menace and kitsch... Six Feet Under are obviously having a blast as they rip through them.&quot;

Six Feet Under released their sixth studio album on March 21, 2005, entitled &quot;13&quot;. While writing the lyrics, Chris Barnes reportedly entered &quot;a vision&quot; from smoking large quantities of marijuana and meditating.

Metal Blade Records issued &quot;A Decade in the Grave&quot; on October 28, 2005, a five-disc box set. The first two discs are &#x27;best-of&#x27; material, the third is a rarities collection, the fourth disc is from one of the band&#x27;s first concerts back in 1995, and the final disc is a live DVD from 2005.

In November 2005, Chris Barnes joined the Finnish death metal band Torture Killer as lead vocalist for a side project. His new bandmates saw this as a huge compliment, having started out as a Six Feet Under and Obituary cover band. Barnes sung vocals on their 2006 studio album &quot;Swarm!&quot;

===&quot;Commandment&quot;, &quot;Death Rituals&quot;, and &quot;Graveyard Classics 3&quot; (2007–2010)===
Six Feet Under toured for the majority of 2006 before hitting the studios to record their next album, &quot;Commandment&quot;, which was released on April 17, 2007. The album works within the band&#x27;s formula. According to music critic Chad Bowar, the album has &quot;catchy death metal songs... [that are] crushingly heavy, but also have a great groove to them.&quot;

Six Feet Under played Metalfest 2007 tour alongside openers Finntroll, Belphegor, and Nile, their most heavily promoted tour to date. A music video for &quot;Doomsday&quot; aired on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;, starting on November 10 of that year.

On December 24, 2007, Six Feet Under announced on their website that they would go to the studio in early 2008 to record a new album. The album, titled &quot;Death Rituals&quot;, was released on Metal Blade Records on November 11, 2008, in the US, and November 17, 2008, in the UK.

As announced on January 31, 2008, Chris Barnes officially parted ways with Torture Killer, to be replaced by Juri Sallinen. Drummer Greg Gall was currently writing and recording material with a new band called Exitsect, along with guitarist Sam Williams (Denial Fiend, Down by Law), bassist Frank Watkins (Obituary, Gorgoroth), guitarist Joe Kiser (Murder-Suicide Pact, Slap Of Reality) and vocalist Paul Pavlovich (Assück).

&quot;Graveyard Classics 3&quot; was released on January 19, 2010.

===&quot;Undead&quot;, and &quot;Unborn&quot; (2011–2013)===
In early 2011, Terry Butler left to join fellow death metal band Obituary. Drummer Greg Gall had also left.

In November 2011, Rob Arnold and Matt Devries posted statements saying they have departed from Chimaira to play in Six Feet Under full-time. However, in 2012, Matt Devries left the band to join Fear Factory, replacing longtime bassist Byron Stroud. The vacant position was subsequently filled by ex-Brain Drill 7-string bassist, Jeff Hughell.

The band&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Undead&quot; was released on May 22, 2012. It was also announced on the same day that Rob Arnold would be replaced by Swedish guitarist Ola Englund of bands Feared and Scarpoint. The band says that Rob will remain a central writing partner and collaborator on future Six Feet Under releases.

The band released their tenth album &quot;Unborn&quot; on March 19, 2013.

According to a recent interview on March 21, 2013, Barnes is already writing material for the band&#x27;s next album.

In 2013, guitarist Ola Englund and drummer Kevin Talley departed the band. Marco Pitruzzella took over on drums.

===&quot; Crypt of the Devil&quot; and &quot;Graveyard Classics IV: The Number of the Priest &quot; (2014–2016) ===
On May 5, 2015, Six Feet Under released their eleventh studio album, &quot;Crypt of the Devil&quot;. On this release Chris Barnes incorporated Phil Hall, Josh Hall and Brandon Ellis from the band Cannabis Corpse for the studio line up.

In April 2015, Jeff Hughell left the Hatefest tour in Europe and Victor Brandt of Entombed filled in as a temporary bassist.

The band released their fourth cover album Graveyard Classics IV: The Number of the Priest on May 27, 2016, with Ray Suhy on guitar and bass and Josh Hall on drums, both from Cannabis Corpse, appearing on the album.

In 2016 longtime guitarist Steve Swanson left the band and was replaced by Cannabis Corpse member Ray Suhy.

=== &quot;Torment&quot;, &quot;Unburied&quot;, &quot;Nightmares of the Decomposed&quot;, and &quot;Killing for Revenge&quot; (2017–present)===
On January 10, 2017, the band announced their twelfth studio album, &quot;Torment&quot;, which was released by Metal Blade Records on February 24. The album marked the debut of drummer Marco Pitruzzella with the addition of Jeff Hughell who recorded guitar and bass for the album. Torment was received poorly by fans and critics alike, citing lazy songwriting and poor production. On February 28, former Cannibal Corpse and Deicide guitarist Jack Owen joined the band.

The band released a digital-only EP on July 6, 2018, titled &quot;Unburied&quot;, consisting of previously unreleased material from the recording sessions of their prior four albums. That same year, Chris announced that the band was writing material for their 13th album. The album title, &quot;Nightmares of the Decomposed&quot;, was revealed on April 21 and was released on October 2, 2020.

Six Feet Under&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Killing for Revenge&quot;, was released on May 10, 2024.

<text>Carte Blanche is a South African investigative journalism television series that airs on television network M-Net Sundays at night. It premiered in 1988 and focuses on investigation into corruption, consumer issues and current events.

==History==

&quot;Carte Blanche&quot; began its broadcast in 1988, anchored by Derek Watts and Ruda Landman. Landman left the show in 2007; the same year Bongani Bingwa became a presenter.

In January 2010, two spinoff series, &quot;Carte Blanche Medical&quot; and &quot;Carte Blanche Consumer&quot;, began. &quot;Carte Blanche Medical&quot; premiered on 18 January 2010 and was anchored by Bongani Bingwa, while &quot;Carte Blanche Consumer&quot;, premiering on 24 January 2010, was anchored by Devi Sankaree Govender. Both series, which ran for four seasons, were cancelled in 2011. Shortly thereafter, on 24 January 2011, &quot;Carte Blanche Extra&quot; launched, but was cancelled after only airing 10 episodes.

To celebrate 25 years on air on 1 September 2013, &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; broadcast from the Telkom Joburg Tower in Hillbrow, closed to the public in 1981 during a state of emergency. A book &quot;Carte Blanche 25: The Stories Behind the Stories&quot; was published, looking at memorable moments behind the scenes of South Africa&#x27;s longest running current affairs show.

A Carte Blanche channel featuring coverage of the Trial of Oscar Pistorius was launched on DStv on 2 March 2014.

==Carte Blanche Making a Difference Trust==

To celebrate 20 years on air in 2008, Carte Blanche launched the Making a Difference (MAD) Trust to raise funds for specialised paediatric units in selected state hospitals and several welfare organisations across South Africa. The Trust has undertaken major paediatric ward revitalisation and capital building projects around the country and has completed over 20 projects to date.

Apart from several infrastructural upgrades at two child welfare organisations, the Carte Blanche Making a Difference Trust has in previous years supported feeding schemes and assisted in providing food parcels and managing supplies at Inchanga in KZN and Johannesburg Child Welfare and Johannesburg Parent and Child Counselling Centres in greater Johannesburg and at Hartebeespoort Dam in the North-West province.

<doc id="568310" wikidata="Q2159779" url="?curid=568310" title="Robin Hanson">
<text>Robin Dale Hanson (born August 28, 1959) is an American economist and author. He is associate professor of economics at George Mason University and a former research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University. Hanson is known for his work on idea futures and markets, and he was involved in the creation of the Foresight Institute&#x27;s Foresight Exchange and DARPA&#x27;s FutureMAP project. He invented market scoring rules like LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule) used by prediction markets such as Consensus Point (where Hanson is Chief Scientist), and has conducted research on signalling. He also proposed the Great Filter hypothesis.

==Background==
Hanson received a BS in physics from the University of California, Irvine in 1981, an MS in physics and an MA in Conceptual Foundations of Science from the University of Chicago in 1984, and a PhD in social science from Caltech in 1997 for his thesis titled &quot;Four puzzles in information and politics: Product bans, informed voters, social insurance, and persistent disagreement&quot;. Before getting his PhD he researched artificial intelligence, Bayesian statistics and hypertext publishing at Lockheed, NASA, and elsewhere. In addition, he started the first internal corporate prediction market at Xanadu in 1990.

He is married to Peggy Jackson, a hospice social worker, and has two children. He is the son of a Southern Baptist preacher. Hanson has elected to have his brain cryonically preserved in the event of medical death. He was involved early on in the creation of the Rationalist community through online weblogs.

==Views==

Tyler Cowen&#x27;s book &quot;Discover Your Inner Economist&quot; includes a fairly detailed discussion of Hanson&#x27;s views:

Nate Silver, in his book &quot;The Signal and the Noise&quot; (2012), writes:

Hanson is credited with originating the concept of the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a DARPA project to implement a market for betting on future developments in the Middle East. Hanson has expressed great disappointment in DARPA&#x27;s cancellation of its related FutureMAP project, and he attributes this to the controversy surrounding the related Total Information Awareness program. He also created and supports a proposed system of government called futarchy, in which policies would be determined by prediction markets.

In a controversial 2018 blog post on the incel movement, Hanson appeared to agree with the incel movement&#x27;s likening of the distribution of job opportunities to &quot;access to sex&quot;. He wrote that he found it puzzling that similar concern had not been shown for incels as for low-income individuals. Some journalists, such as Alexandra Scaggs in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, criticized Hanson for discussing sex as if it was a commodity.

Hanson has been criticized for his writings relating to sexual relationships and women. &quot;If you’ve ever heard of George Mason University economist Robin Hanson, there’s a good chance it was because he wrote something creepy&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot; columnist Jordan Weissman wrote in 2018. In an article on bias against women in economics, Bloomberg columnist Noah Smith cited a blog post by Hanson comparing cuckoldry to &quot;gentle silent rape&quot;, lamenting that there was no retraction and no outcry from fellow economists. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Jia Tolentino described Hanson&#x27;s blog post as a &quot;flippantly dehumanizing thought experiment&quot;.

A 2003 article in &quot;Fortune&quot; examined Hanson&#x27;s work, noting, among other things, that he is a proponent of cryonics and that his ideas have found some acceptance among extropians on the Internet. He has since written extensively on the topic. Hanson also coined the term Great Filter, referring to whatever prevents &quot;dead matter&quot; from becoming an expanding and observable intelligent civilization. He was motivated to seek his doctorate so that his theories would reach a wider audience.

== Books ==
Hanson has written two books. &quot;The Age of Em&quot; (2016) concerns his views on brain emulation and its eventual impact on society. &quot;The Elephant in the Brain&quot; (2018), coauthored with Kevin Simler, looks at mental blind spots of society and individuals.

<text>Buttermilk Falls State Park is a state park located southwest of Ithaca, New York, United States. Like Robert H. Treman State Park, a portion of the land that was to become the state park came from Robert and Laura Treman in 1924.

==History==
Buttermilk Falls was named for the frothy appearance of its churning waters. The naming of the cascade was described in 1866:

The original of the park were presented as a gift to New York State by Robert and Laura Treman in 1924. It grew to its current size through various state acquisitions in the years that followed.

Revolutionary War era soldier Joseph Plumb Martin mentioned a Buttermilk Falls in his diary; however, this refers to present day Highland Falls in the Hudson Valley and not in Ithaca, NY.

==Geology==
The rock formations within the park are primarily made of Devonian shale and sandstone. These rocks formed in horizontal layers, creating flat slabs and angular edges as they erode and fracture. The gorge and waterfalls formed since the last ice age — within the last twenty or thirty thousands years — as Buttermilk Creek eroded back from the head of a hanging valley. Additional formations along the creek include potholes and a stack called &quot;Pinnacle Rock&quot;.

==Park description==
Buttermilk Falls State Park features 10 waterfalls in total, with Buttermilk Falls being the main attraction. The park also offers a beach, cabins, fishing, hiking, deer bow-hunting, nature trails, pavilions, a playground, playing fields, recreation programs, and a campground with tent and trailer sites.

===Trails===
The nature trails in the park include Gorge Trail, which follows Buttermilk Creek as it cascades, dropping about along the trail. Gorge Trail is complemented by Rim Trail on the other side of the creek, which make for a loop of about . Beyond these two trails is the Bear Trail which continues up Buttermilk Creek to Lake Treman Falls and Lake Treman. The trail to and around the lake is another . At the far end of the lake is a spur of the Finger Lakes Trail. Another trail in the park is the Larch Trail, which circles a marsh near the main (lower) parking area and is about in length.
