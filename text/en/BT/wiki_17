<text>The RIVA TNT, codenamed &quot;NV4&quot;, is a 2D, video, and 3D graphics accelerator chip for PCs that was developed by Nvidia and released in March 1998. It cemented Nvidia&#x27;s reputation as a worthy rival within the developing consumer 3D graphics adapter industry. It succeeded the RIVA 128.

RIVA is an acronym for Real-timeInteractiveVideo andAnimation accelerator&quot;. The &quot;TNT&quot; suffix refers to the chip&#x27;s ability to work on two [[Texel (graphics)|texels]] at once (TwiN Texel&quot;).

The first graphics card that was based on the RIVA TNT chip was the Velocity 4400, released by STB Systems on June 15, 1998.

==Overview==
The TNT was designed as a follow-up to the RIVA 128 and a response to 3Dfx&#x27;s introduction of the Voodoo2. It added a second pixel pipeline, practically doubling rendering speed, and used considerably faster memory. Unlike the Voodoo2 (but like the slower Matrox G200) it also added support for a 32-bit (truecolor) pixel format, 24-bit Z-buffer in 3D mode, an 8-bit stencil buffer and support for 1024×1024 pixel textures. Improved mipmapping and texture filtering techniques, including newly added support for trilinear filtering, dramatically improved quality compared to the TNT&#x27;s predecessor. TNT also added support for up to 16 MiB of SDRAM. Like RIVA 128, RIVA TNT is a single chip solution.


The TNT shipped later than originally planned, ran quite hot, and was clocked lower than Nvidia had planned at 90 MHz instead of 110 MHz. Originally planned specifications should have placed the card ahead of Voodoo2 in theoretical performance for Direct3D applications, but at 90 MHz it did not quite match the Voodoo2.

At the time, most games supported 3dfx&#x27;s proprietary Glide API which gave the Voodoo2 a large advantage in speed and image quality, and some games only used the Glide API for 3D acceleration, leaving TNT users no better off than people who didn&#x27;t have a 3D accelerator. Even in &quot;OpenGL only&quot; comparisons such as the case in Quake 2, the Voodoo2 had the upper hand as a custom &quot;MiniGL&quot; driver was made specifically for 3dfx cards to run the game (and most other OpenGL games at the time). The 3dfx MiniGL driver was not a fully featured OpenGL driver, but a wrapper that mapped certain OpenGL functions to their equivalents in Glide, and was able to attain a speed advantage because of that. Later on when fully featured OpenGL drivers were made for the 3dfx line of cards, it was noticed that it was much slower when compared to its cut down MiniGL brother. The TNT had 32-bit color support while the Voodoo2 only supported 16-bit (although internally dithered down from 24-bit color, beating the TNT in 16bit quality). Voodoo2 cards also gained an even larger speed advantage over the TNT because of the ability to link two Voodoo2 cards together in an &quot;SLI&quot; setup.

TNT did not match the sales of the incredibly popular Voodoo2. 3Dfx&#x27;s customer mind share was at its peak during this time and Nvidia was still a somewhat new player. Again, like with the RIVA 128, the lack of Glide API support hindered Nvidia&#x27;s opportunities for market share growth. Glide was considered the best 3D gaming API available by both gamers and developers. However, TNT gained Nvidia much attention and paved the way for the refreshed version called the RIVA TNT2. After all, unlike the rest of the competition, Nvidia had come close to the Voodoo2 in performance in some games, and beaten it in 32bit image quality.
In what would become standard industry practice on a massive scale in later years, Nvidia released a budget version of TNT called Vanta. This board used the same TNT chip but lowered its clock speed and halved both memory data bus width (to 64-bit) and memory size (to 16 MiB). By doing this, Nvidia was able to still sell TNT chips that couldn&#x27;t reach the TNT&#x27;s specified clock speeds, a practice known as binning, and cut board costs significantly by using a narrower bus and less RAM. The board proved popular with OEM computer builders because of its capable feature-set and low price. Vanta also was implemented as integrated graphics on some motherboards.

TNT itself was used on several popular cards, such as the Diamond Viper V550 and STB Velocity 4400, both of which managed OEM wins with the likes of Dell and Gateway, among others.

== Drivers ==
Nvidia&#x27;s driver development with TNT was the beginning of their notably aggressive efforts to maintain the best set of drivers possible. TNT received the first branded driver within the industry, called &quot;Detonator&quot;.

These drivers were a huge success. While the TNT had always performed well on Intel based systems, it previously lagged behind in terms of performance on then current AMD based systems. At the time, Quake2 was the benchmark for performance and the 3dfx-made Voodoo2 enjoyed a large performance difference over the TNT because it had 3DNow! optimizations that negated the performance penalty of the weak, unpipelined FPU on then current AMD processors. The Detonator drivers included 3DNow! optimizations and the TNT&#x27;s Quake2 performance jumped 30%. In fact, all OpenGL and DirectX applications benefited from such optimizations. This made the TNT a much more attractive 3D accelerator for AMD owners than previously.

The Detonator drivers also fixed compatibility issues with motherboards of the time, and improved overall software compatibility.

The TNT was the last Nvidia graphics accelerator to have support for Windows 3.1x.

<doc id="565700" wikidata="Q457304" url="?curid=565700" title="Okapi Wildlife Reserve">
<text>The Okapi Wildlife Reserve () is a wildlife reserve in the Ituri Forest in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near the borders with South Sudan and Uganda. At approximately 14,000 km2, it covers approximately one-fifth of the area of the forest. In 1996, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, due to its large population of endangered okapis and its high overall biodiversity.

==Ecology==
The wildlife reserve makes up roughly one-fifth of the total area of the Ituri Forest. As a Pleistocene refugium, the forest contains dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests, dominated by &quot;Mbau&quot; trees (&quot;Gilbertiodendron dewevrei&quot;). The Nepoko, Ituri, and Epulu rivers flow through the reserve, surrounded by swamp forests. The granite outcrops in the north of the reserve protect critical habitat for &quot;Encephalartos ituriensis&quot;, a threatened species of cycad.

Because of its relatively stable climate during the repeated ice ages, the wildlife reserve, and the Ituri Forest as a whole, protects a unique biological community. As its name implies, the Okapi Wildlife Reserve is home to many okapis. As of 1996, the number was estimated at 3900–6350, out of a global population of around 10,000–20,000. In 1996, there were roughly 7,500 elephants and 7,500 chimpanzees within the reserve, although those numbers have likely declined significantly in recent years due to poaching and political instability.

Other mammals identified within the reserve include the leopard, forest buffalo, water chevrotain, bongo, Bates&#x27;s pygmy antelope, and giant forest hog. The Ituri Forests is home to 17 primate species have been observed within the reserve, have the highest primate species richness of any African forest.

The reserve has over 370 species of bird, and is one of the most important sites for bird conservation in mainland Africa. Many of the bird species found in the reserve are endemic to the Congo Basin, including the endangered Congo peafowl.

The imposing Mbiya Mountain overlooks the Epulu village, and nomadic Mbuti pygmies and Bantu farmers also live within the reserve.

==History==
The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was created with the help of the Okapi Conservation Project in 1992. The project continues to support the reserve by training and equipping wildlife guards and by providing assistance to improve the lives of neighboring communities. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in danger in 1997. The main threats to the reserve are deforestation, primarily caused by slash and burn agriculture, and commercial hunting for the sale of bushmeat. Gold mining has also been problematic to the Reserve. As of 2005, the fighting in the eastern part of the country moved within the boundaries of the Reserve, causing its staff to flee or be evacuated. Lack of funding due to the poor political and economic conditions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has also been problematic. It is hoped that eco-tourism to the area can be developed, leading to both increased funding and improved public awareness.

==Conservation==
The wildlife reserve the location of the Epulu Conservation and Research Center, on the Epulu River. This facility dates back to 1928 when the camp was founded by American anthropologist Patrick Putnam as a capture station, where wild okapis were captured and sent to American and European zoos. Until 2012 it still served that function, albeit with very different methodology, as the okapis remained in Congo. In 2012 a rebel attack left the center&#x27;s captive okapis dead and it was decided to focus exclusively (at least as long as there were security concerns) on preserving the wild okapis in the reserve. The center also carries out much important research and conservation work.

==Gold mining==
As of 2015 there was a gold artisanal mining camp at Muchacha within the reserve employing about 8,000 people. The mine was run by a loosely organized rebel faction, Mai-Mai Simba, who aimed to liberate the local population from the reserve&#x27;s land use restrictions. The warden of the reserve, Colonel Lucien Gedeon Lokumu announced operation to clear the reserve of rebel forces and mining operations.

A June 2021 report from the United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo raised concerns about the presence of semi-industrialized dredging operations 12 kilometers south of Bandegaido, within the Okapi Wildlife reserve. Mining took place within the &quot;Muchacha Ming Complex&quot; (MMC) which is covered by a permit from the official DRC Mining Cadastre, held by the Chinese businessman Kong Maohuai&#x27;s &quot;MCC Resources&quot;. The company &quot;Kimia Mining Investment sarl&quot; was operating at the mine. Mining is illegal in the reserve, and FARDC troops were guarding the mining site, also in violation of Congolese law.

Later that month, the Congolese authorities announced the seizure of 31 kg of gold (about $1.9 million worth) from this Muchaha mine. As of 2022, non-governmental organizations such as the &quot;Council for Environmental Defense through Legality and Traceability&quot; (CODELT) and &quot;Alerte Congolaise pour l’Environnement et les Droits de l’Homme&quot; (ACEDH) blame mining operations for destroying pristine rainforest within the reserve.

==Rebel attacks==

On 24 June 2012, the Epulu Conservation and Research Center was attacked, looted and burned by a group of Mai-Mai rebels, led by Paul Sadala (alias &quot;Morgan&quot;) and consisting of elephant poachers and illegal miners. During the attack, 13 of the 14 okapis at the center were killed (the last died later of injuries sustained during the attack) and six people, including two wildlife rangers, were also killed. Many other locals, some minors, were abducted, but all were released later. In early August, the security situation had improved due to Congolese army troops and guards from the Congolese Wildlife Authority, and preparations for repairs of the center had begun. Following donations from around the world, it had been rebuilt a year after the attack.

On 14 July 2017, there was an attack in the section of the reserve near Mambasa, likely by Mai-Mai rebels. Foreign journalists (two British and an American) and several local park rangers escaped unharmed, but five local reserve employees (four wardens and a tracker) were killed. Several of the attackers were also killed.

<text>The Whopper is the signature hamburger brand of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King, its Australian franchise Hungry Jack&#x27;s, and BK Whopper Bar kiosks. Introduced in 1957 in response to the large burger size of a local restaurant in Gainesville, Florida, it became central to Burger King&#x27;s advertising, including the chain&#x27;s tagline &quot;the Home of the Whopper.&quot; Burger King&#x27;s competitors began releasing similar products in the 1970s designed to compete against it.

The hamburger has undergone several reformulations, including changes to portion size and the bread used. Burger King sells several variants that are either limited-time seasonal promotions or tailored to regional tastes and customs. A smaller version called the Whopper Jr. was introduced in 1963.

==History==
The Whopper was created in 1957 by Burger King co-founder James McLamore and originally sold for 37 US cents (equivalent to US$ in ). McLamore created the burger after he noticed that a rival restaurant in Gainesville, Florida, was succeeding by selling a larger burger. Believing that the success of the rival product was its size, he devised the Whopper, naming it so because he thought it conveyed &quot;imagery of something big&quot;. Major fast food chains did not release a similar product until the McDonald&#x27;s Quarter Pounder and the Burger Chef Big Shef in the early 1970s.

Initially, the sandwich was made with a plain bun; however, that changed when the company switched to a sesame-seeded bun around 1970. In 1985, the weight of the Whopper was increased to , while the bun was replaced by a Kaiser roll.&lt;ref name=&quot;nrn-1/3lbwhopper&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a program to improve the product and was accompanied by a US$30 million (US$ million in ) advertising campaign featuring various celebrities such as Mr. T and Loretta Swit. The goal of the program was to help differentiate the company and its products from those of its competitors. The Whopper reverted to its previous size in 1987 when a new management team took over the company and reverted many of the changes initiated prior to 1985. In 1994, the Whopper sandwich&#x27;s Kaiser roll reverted to a sesame seed bun, eliminating the last trace of the sandwich&#x27;s 1985 reconfiguration.

The packaging has undergone many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald&#x27;s, the company never used the clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam came to a head in the late-1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard boxes for its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to a half-wrapped sandwich packaged in a paperboard box, marking a return to the paperboard box for its packaging since 1991.

The Whopper Jr. was created, by accident, in 1963 by Luis Arenas-Pérez (a.k.a. Luis Arenas), the only Latino in the Burger King Hall of Fame and president and CEO of Burger King in Puerto Rico. Upon the opening of the first Burger King restaurant in Carolina, Puerto Rico, the molds for the (standard) Whopper buns had not yet arrived to Puerto Rico from the United States mainland and thus there were no buns to make and sell the company&#x27;s flagship Whopper offering. Arenas opted for honoring the advertised opening date but using the much smaller regular hamburger buns locally available. The result was such a success that Burger King adopted it worldwide and called it the Whopper Jr.

In 2020, as part of a global advertising campaign showing the company&#x27;s commitment to dropping all artificial preservatives, Burger King ran the &quot;Moldy Whopper&quot; ad showing a Whopper decomposing and rotting over a period of 34 days. The Moldy Whopper campaign reached a level of awareness 50 percent higher than Burger King&#x27;s ad in the 2019 Super Bowl.

=== Competitors&#x27; products ===
Competitors such as McDonald&#x27;s and Wendy&#x27;s have attempted to create burgers similar to the Whopper, often nicknamed a &quot;Whopper Stopper&quot; during the development phase. Wendy&#x27;s created the Big Classic with similar toppings but served on a bulkie roll, while McDonald&#x27;s has created at least six different versions, including the McDLT, the Arch Deluxe, and the Big N&#x27; Tasty, most of which generally failed and are not sold in most restaurants today.

==Product description==
The Whopper is a hamburger consisting of a flame-grilled beef patty, sesame seed bun, mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and sliced onion. Optional ingredients such as American cheese, bacon, mustard, guacamole or jalapeño peppers may be added upon request (with optional additions varying depending on region and availability). Regional and international condiments include BBQ sauce and salsa. Burger King will also add any condiment it sells upon request, as per its long-standing slogan &quot;Have It Your Way&quot;. It is available with one, two or three beef patties and in a smaller version called the Whopper Jr, or without meat in a version called the Veggie Whopper. The Australian franchise of Burger King, Hungry Jack&#x27;s, sells its veggie burger sandwich as the Veggie Whopper. Additionally, Burger King has sold several different promotional varieties throughout the years as limited-time offerings (LTO). With the addition of hot dogs to the company&#x27;s menu in February 2016, Burger King began testing its first major variant called the Whopper Dog in May of the same year across various regions within the United States. The new dog featured a grilled Oscar Mayer hot dog with all of the ingredients featured on the Whopper sandwich.

In February 2020, Burger King accounted that it would remove artificial preservatives, colors, and flavors from the Whopper by the end of 2020.

There are localized versions of the Whopper in several of its international operations, such as the teriyaki Whopper in Japan or the LTO Canadian Whopper. Following its entry in India, to accommodate cultural taboos of India related to beef, the chain has eliminated beef Whopper from its menu and instead introduced mutton Whopper, veggie Whopper, and the chicken Whopper.

=== Variants ===

The is a 100% vegetarian burger with a patty manufactured by Impossible Foods of Oakland, California. Burger King began test marketing the Impossible Whopper in April 2019 at locations in and around St. Louis, Missouri. It was accompanied with an April Fools-themed promotional video on April 1, 2019. Later that month, the company announced plans to roll out Impossible Whoppers nationwide before the end of the year. In August, it was made available nationwide.
The was sold in Japan for the promotion of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 7 operating system. The hamburger contained seven stacked beef patties and measured high, weighed almost , and had more than . It was originally planned to be available for only seven days starting on 22 October 2009. Due to its success in selling 6,000 sandwiches within the first four days, Burger King decided to extend the promotion period an extra nine days, ending on 6 November. The campaign was met with unexpected popularity in Japan, sparking multiple YouTube videos and blog posts about the burger.

The is a burger sold exclusively at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City, that was introduced in September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5 inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the recommended daily allowance of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144 grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780 mg of sodium, more than double the recommended daily allowance for adults. However, according to Burger King&#x27;s Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24 g fat (10 g saturated), and 630 mg sodium.

The has jalapeños, &quot;Angry Sauce&quot; and &quot;Angry Onions&quot;, pepper jack cheese and bacon. Originally released in Europe, the sandwich made its way to the United States in 2008. A variation called the Angriest Whopper debuted in 2016; The new variant added a red bun with hot pepper sauce baked into the roll. The Angriest Whopper followed a similar sandwich, the A1 Halloween Whopper released for Halloween 2015, which was prepared with black-colored, smoke-flavored buns. The Angry Whopper was released with a viral marketing push created by Burger King&#x27;s advertising agency at the time, Crispin Porter + Bogusky. The two tiered program, designed to create a word-of-mouth marketing push, featured a webpage that allowed consumers to create an &quot;Angry-gram&quot; that could be emailed to other individuals. The form letter format page would send an insulting email to a recipient of choice from the sender. The second part consisted of a Facebook-oriented program where the company would issue a coupon for a free sandwich if the consumer would de-friend 10 people on their Facebook page. The Angriest Whopper was pitched using advertising similar to trailers for movie sequels, with a movie trailer-style opening screen, shots of lava, a helicopter and flames. The tag line for the ad was &quot;The only way to handle the heat is to embrace it.&quot;

The was a direct competitor to the Quarter Pounder sandwich from McDonald&#x27;s. It consisted of a Whopper with only ketchup, mustard, pickle and onions.

The Whopperito is a burrito containing all the ingredients of the Whopper except ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard, which are replaced with queso sauce. It was first introduced at select locations in Pennsylvania in June 2016, and was rolled out throughout the United States the following August.

In the Philippines, notable variants of the Whopper include the , which contains three different kinds of meat – bacon, pepperoni and the beef patty itself – as well as another variant, the Meat Beast Whopper, which included ham, and the 4-Cheese Whopper, which contains four different types of cheese: Swiss, American, mozzarella and cheese sauce. For a limited time, the Bacon 4-Cheese Whopper and Cheetos 4-Cheese Crunch were made available, which included bacon and Cheetos, respectively. The Angry Whopper was made available in 2015 and again in 2020.

In October 2019, Hungry Jack&#x27;s in Australia introduced the Rebel Whopper which contains a meat-free patty made from protein extracted from legumes, created in partnership with Australian company v2food. Burger King in New Zealand introduced the Rebel Whopper to their range in January 2020. It was introduced to the Philippines as the Plant-Based Whopper in November 2020. In December 2020, it was made available in Japan for a limited time. That same month, the Plant-Based Whopper was introduced by Burger King outlets in China but with a patty made by UK company The Vegetarian Butcher.

=== Discontinued variants ===

As part of the 45th anniversary of the Whopper sandwich in 2002, Burger King introduced a grilled chicken version of the sandwich called the Chicken Whopper and added a smaller Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich along with a new Caesar salad sandwich topped with a Chicken Whopper patty. The introduction of the Chicken Whopper represented the company&#x27;s first move to extend the Whopper brand name beyond beef based sandwiches since the original Whopper&#x27;s introduction in the 1950s. The sandwiches featured a whole chicken breast filet, weighing either for the larger sandwich or a for the Jr., mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato on a sesame seed roll. A newly reformulated low fat mayonnaise was introduced in conjunction with the new sandwiches. Along with the company&#x27;s new BK Veggie sandwich, The Chicken Whopper Jr. version of the sandwich was lauded by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) as being one of the best nutritionally sound products sold by a fast food chain. Conversely, the CSPI decried the rest of the Burger King menu as being vastly unhealthy.

Development of the sandwich began in 2001 in response to several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King held a series of consumer tests that showed the company&#x27;s customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of the sandwiches, eventually displacing the BK Broiler&#x27;s initial launch figures as the company&#x27;s best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper was one of the few noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it was too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper&#x27;s initial success, just over a year after its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King&#x27;s largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.

==Advertising==
One of the original slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was &quot;There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper&quot;; the claim is based on an exponential function of whether the sandwich has the ingredient or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to &quot;There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich&quot;. Other slogans include &quot;It takes two hands to handle a Whopper&quot; and &quot;Burger King: Home of the Whopper&quot;.Notes 3]

Where&#x27;s Herb? was an advertising campaign for the sandwich from 1985 to 1986 designed by J. Walter Thompson. The television commercials featured a fictional character named Herb, who was described as a nerd who had never eaten a Burger King burger in his life. They called on fans to visit their local Burger King in the hope of finding Herb and winning a prize. The campaign also included an &quot;I&#x27;m not Herb&quot; promotion, in which customers could get a discounted Whopper by including the phrase in their order. At first, people were confused because they did not know what Herb looked like. The promotion was poorly received by both franchises and the public, and its failure prompted Burger King to drop JWT in 1987.

The Whopper has been at the center of several hoaxes and pranks from the company. In a 1998 April Fool&#x27;s Day prank, Burger King took out a full page advertisement in several national publications such as &quot;USA Today&quot; advertising a new version of the sandwich called the &quot;Left-Handed Whopper&quot;. The advertisement claimed that the condiments were all rotated 180° to accommodate southpaws. Another prank from 2013 claimed that the company was introducing a &quot;hands-free Whopper holder&quot; to allow people to eat the sandwich while doing other activities. The unit, similar to a harmonica holder, was supposed to be introduced in Puerto Rico to celebrate the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary. It was later revealed to be a joke. A 2007 advertising campaign celebrating the golden anniversary of the Whopper showed real customers in Las Vegas reacting to the false news the Whopper has been discontinued. While it was not permanently discontinued, the ad claims it was discontinued for one day. Later versions of the ads had customers receiving a Big Mac or Wendy&#x27;s Single and their reactions to the sandwich. In-store ads, such as posters and tray-liners, attack the size and quality of the Big Mac. The campaign won the 2009 Effie Award as one of the best restaurant advertising promotions for 2007–2008.

Crispin, Porter + Bogusky, Burger King&#x27;s advertising company of record from 2003 to 2011, produced several notable ads for the Whopper. In December 2008, Burger King purchased the rights to an advertising campaign that centered on a taste-test marketing campaign, dubbed &quot;Whopper Virgins&quot;. The test claimed to target participants who were unaware of the existence of Burger King or McDonald&#x27;s, and had never eaten a hamburger. Three remote areas of the world—Baan Khun Chang Kiean, Thailand; Kulusuk, Greenland; and Budeşti, Romania—were targeted. In the test, the &quot;virgins&quot; were asked to try both the McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac and the Burger King Whopper, and give their preference, if any. According to the advertisements and accompanying mini-documentary, the Whopper was the most popular sandwich among the test subjects. A social media based promotion from Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2009 gave a free Whopper coupon for every 10 friends on Facebook a user would drop. The advertising program dubbed &quot;Whopper Sacrifice&quot;, was stopped after a week when Facebook canceled the Whopper Sacrifice account as a violation of its user privacy policy. This was despite the fact that the Burger King application was downloaded 60,000 times and 200,000 people were defriended. The company&#x27;s final advertising campaign for the company was its &quot;Whopper Lust&quot; commercial which was a cross promotion with DirectTV. The promotion had an image of a Whopper on channel 111, and for every 5 minutes the image remained on the TV a free Whopper coupon would be sent to the subscriber. By the end of the promotion, over 50,000 coupons were distributed.

After parting ways with Crispin Porter + Bogusky in 2011, the company hired the firm of McGarryBowen to handle its advertising. McGarry Bowen changed the direction of the advertisements so that they centered on the ingredients of the products instead of humor. One of the new advertisements produced by them featured the new California Whopper, made with guacamole, Swiss cheese and bacon. The new television spot had no words, only images of the ingredients for the sandwich being prepared and used to assemble the new sandwich accompanied by a pulsating soundtrack.

=== Controversies ===
Several of CP+B&#x27;s advertising programs for Burger King, including ones for the Whopper, drew criticism from groups for perceived cultural insensitivity or misogynistic themes within them. In May 2006, in an American promotion of the Texas Double Whopper, Burger King released a campaign called the &quot;Manthem&quot; which parodies Helen Reddy&#x27;s &quot;I Am Woman&quot;. It depicts a man and his girlfriend at a fancy restaurant. Disappointed by the meager portions he is served, the man bursts into song, expressing his desire for a Texas Double Whopper, in place of what he deems &quot;chick food.&quot; As he walks out of the restaurant, he is joined by a chorus of men who rebel by not only eating Texas Double Whoppers, but also go commando, lift a minivan over the side of an overpass, and unfurl a banner which says &quot;Eat This Meat.&quot; This has been the source of some controversy, as the commercial has been described as demeaning to male vegetarians/vegans, as well as misogynistic.

Another problematic CP+B advertising program was for the 2009 Texican Whopper that featured commercial known as &quot;The Little Mexican&quot;. The Texican Whopper was a limited-time-only version of the Whopper sold in Europe and was advertised with an ad that featured a pair of actors dressed as a cowboy and a lucha libre wrestler. The problem arose when the Mexican Ambassador to Spain complained that the commercial featured demeaning stereotypes of Mexicans. Additionally, the print version of the advertisement featured the wrestler wearing a cape that appeared to be a Mexican flag, a violation of Mexican laws governing the usage of its national banner. Burger King eventually pulled the ad and issued an apology to the Mexican government. Conversely, the Mexican newspaper &quot;Excélsior&quot; issued a parody of the ad featuring American president Barack Obama as the cowboy and Mexican President Felipe Calderon as the wrestler as a commentary on the relationship between the two countries.

In 2013, Burger King introduced a commercial in Russia, in which a Whopper was shown crushing red poppies, and the dialogue &quot;This is a poppy. It was popular once, but now its time has passed.&quot; The Russian word for poppy is &quot;mak&quot; (мак), a homophone for Maca major nickname for McDonald&#x27;s in Russia. However, major Russian broadcasters rejected the ad due to concerns over its possible insinuation that the Whopper was better than drugs, as red poppies are in the same plant family as the source of heroin. The company refused to comment of the veracity of the networks&#x27; claims, and instead posted the advertisement on its YouTube channel, eventually pulling it from that service as well.

On April 12, 2017, Burger King released a commercial entitled &quot;Connected Whopper&quot;, in which a store employee says that while he could not explain a Whopper in 15 seconds, he had discovered a different way to do so, after which he states &quot;OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?&quot;. The dialogue was designed to trigger voice searches on Android devices and Google Home smart speakers configured to automatically respond to the phrase &quot;OK Google&quot;. The specific query caused the device to read out a 43 word block of text from Wikipedia&#x27;s article on the Whopper. Prior to the ad&#x27;s premiere, the article had been edited by users, including one named &quot;Burger King Corporation&quot;, so that Google&#x27;s automatically generated knowledge panel would show a description of the Whopper burger in promotional language. The edits were reverted for violating Wikipedia&#x27;s policy against promotion. Soon after the text became the target of vandals, with some falsely adding ingredients such as cyanide and the meat of children to the article. Google blacklisted the advertisement&#x27;s audio so that it would not trigger the always-on voice detection. In turn, Burger King modified the commercial in order to get around this block. A Wikipedia administrator also protected the Whopper article to prevent the promotional descriptions or vandalism from being re-inserted. Despite the controversy, the campaign won the Grand Prix in the direct category at the Cannes Lions festival (under the title &quot;Google Home of the Whopper&quot;), beating &quot;Fearless Girl&quot; by one vote.

On March 28, 2022, a lawsuit was filed against Burger King, alleging the fast food chain falsely advertised the Whopper to be &quot;look about 35% bigger in its advertising than it is in reality&quot;. In 2023 it was declared by a judge that Burger King will face a class action lawsuit regarding the size of the Whopper.

===Tie-ins===
The 2008 movie releases of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; saw a promotional tie-in with the new Indy Whopper featuring bacon, spicy mayo, and pepper jack cheese and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; with the Angry Whopper. A pair of European advertisements for the Dark Whopper, made with pepper-jack cheese, black-pepper ketchup, and &quot;a darkly delicious sauce&quot;, featured two product tie-ins with both the 2007 Spider-Man sequel &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; and the 2008 Batman sequel &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; was linked to Burger King&#x27;s Whiplash Whopper in 2010.

== BK Whopper Bar ==
The BK Whopper Bar is limited service concept created by Burger King in 2009. Whopper Bars are smaller footprint, specialized stores with a menu limited to the company&#x27;s Whopper, crispy chicken sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich sandwiches; drinks; and desserts. The menu features higher-end ingredients and variants not sold in the normal Burger King locations. The concept is similar to the McCafé concept from rival McDonald&#x27;s, and like the McCafé locations they are designed to go into airports, casinos, and other areas with limited amounts of space.

The menu at the Whopper Bar features as many as 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or blue cheese. The open station differs from the company&#x27;s usual kitchen model in that it is in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of the design is to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.

Additionally, the company sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, including Budweiser, Bud Light, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed to target the important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company is known as a fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.

==Nutritional comparison==
The Whopper at per sandwich has more calories than McDonald&#x27;s Big Mac at per sandwich, but is larger – vs. . Therefore, the Whopper contains fewer calories per gram than the Big Mac. The Whopper contains per and the Big Mac contains kcal per . Cheese comes standard on the Big Mac, but is optional on the Whopper.

== Naming and trademarks ==
When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name Whopper in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state-registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger. The chain, owned by Frank and Barbara Bates, prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Barbara Bates, who became the CEO of Whopper Burger after the death of her husband in 1983, retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then-corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid-1980s.

<text>Mad Libs is a word game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. It can be categorized as a phrasal template game.

The game was invented in the United States, and more than 110 million copies of &quot;Mad Libs&quot; books have been sold since the series was first published in 1958.

==History==
Mad Libs was invented in 1953 by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. Stern and Price created the game, but could not agree on a name for their invention. No name was chosen until five years later (1958), when Stern and Price were eating Eggs Benedict at a restaurant in New York City. 
While eating, the two overheard an argument at a neighboring table between a talent agent and an actor. According to Price and Stern, during the overheard argument, the actor said that he wanted to &quot;ad-lib&quot; an upcoming interview. The agent, who clearly disagreed with the actor&#x27;s suggestion, retorted that ad-libbing an interview would be &quot;mad&quot;. Stern and Price used that eavesdropped conversation to create, at length, the name &quot;Mad Libs&quot;. In 1958, the duo released the first book of &quot;Mad Libs&quot;, which resembled the earlier games of consequences and exquisite corpse.

Stern was head writer and comedy director for &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;, and suggested to the show&#x27;s host that guests be introduced using Mad Libs completed by the audience. Four days after an episode introduced &quot;our guest NOUN, Bob Hope&quot;, bookstores sold out of &quot;Mad Libs&quot; books.

Stern and Price next partnered with Larry Sloan, a high school friend who was working as a publicist at the time, to continue publishing &quot;Mad Libs&quot;. Together, the three founded the publishing firm Price Stern Sloan in the early 1960s as a way to release &quot;Mad Libs&quot;. In addition to releasing more than 70 editions of &quot;Mad Libs&quot; under Sloan, the company also published 150 softcover books, including such notable titles as &quot;How to Be a Jewish Mother&quot;, first released in 1964; &quot;Droodles&quot;, which was also created by Roger Price; &quot;The VIP Desk Diary&quot;; and the series &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Jokes&quot;.

Price died in 1990, and three years later, Sloan and Stern sold Price Stern Sloan, including &quot;Mad Libs&quot;, to the former Putnam Berkley Group, which is now known as Penguin Random House. &quot;Mad Libs&quot; books are still published by Penguin Random House; however, all references to Price Stern Sloan have been removed from the company&#x27;s official website. Stern died at age 88 on June 7, 2011, and Sloan on October 14, 2012.

More than 110 million copies of &quot;Mad Libs&quot; have been sold since the game series was first published in 1958.

== Predecessors of Mad Libs ==
It is unclear whether the creators of Mad Libs were aware of existing games and books similar to their own. One such game is &quot;Revelations about my Friends&quot;, published anonymously by Fredrick A. Stokes Companies in New York in 1912. Like Mad Libs, the book invites the reader to choose words of different categories which then become part of a story. The nineteenth century parlor game &quot;Consequences&quot; and the surrealists&#x27; Exquisite Corpse game are also similar to Mad Libs.

==Format==
Mad Libs books contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as &quot;noun&quot;, &quot;verb&quot;, &quot;place&quot;, &quot;celebrity&quot;, &quot;exclamation&quot; or &quot;part of the body&quot;. One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually a sentence which is comical, surreal and/or takes on somewhat of a nonsensical tone.

Stern and Price&#x27;s original Mad Libs book gives the following sentence as an example:

After completion, they demonstrate that the sentence might read:

 &quot;Ouch!&quot; he said stupidly as he jumped into his convertible car and drove off with his brave wife.

==Other media==
A game show called &quot;Mad Libs&quot;, with some connections to the game, aired on the Disney Channel in 1998 and 1999.

Several imitations of Mad Libs have been created, most of them on the Internet. Imitation Mad Libs are sometimes used in educational settings to help teach kids the parts of speech.

Looney Labs released &quot;Mad Libs: The Game&quot;, a card game, in 2016. There is also a Mad Libs mobile app.

<doc id="565706" wikidata="Q978961" url="?curid=565706" title="Hawkwind (album)">
<text>Hawkwind is the debut album by Hawkwind, released in 1970, originally on Liberty Records, later reissued on Sunset Records. This album is historic since it is one of the first space rock LPs.

==Recording==
Dick Taylor of The Pretty Things, who was looking for a new venture after leaving the band, was pulled into Hawkwind by playing some gigs and producing this album. After several unsuccessful attempts in the recording studio, where the band disliked recording their parts separately, they opted to simply record live in the studio.

==Songs==
The bulk of the album is composed of a freeform instrumental piece that the band named &quot;Sunshine Special&quot; but it was separated into different tracks on this album. On the LP, &quot;Paranoia&quot; ends after the first minute with the music slowing down as though the turntable is stopping, and then picks up as the first cut on Side 2. Lyrics are scant, but those that are present and the song titles are a reference to the drug experience, as the sleeve notes explain:

This is the beginning. By now we will be past this album. We started out trying to freak people (trippers), now we are trying to levitate their minds, in a nice way, without acid, and ultimately a completely audio-visual thing. Using a complex of electronics, lights and environmental experiences.

The two bookend pieces of &quot;Hurry on Sundown&quot; and &quot;Mirror of Illusion&quot; are more of a nod to Brock&#x27;s alternative activity of busking and were released as a single in edited form.

==Sleeve==
The cover is a fantasy painting that shows several dragon figures emerging from piles of leaves that also spell out the name of the band. On the front cover, the dragons are shown with human arms, while the reverse cover shows a dragon&#x27;s head as an automobile with a driver wearing sunglasses.

Adverts for the album proclaimed &quot;Hawkwind Is Space Rock&quot;.

==Critical reaction==

Mark Plummer from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reviewed the album in the context of electronic music as &quot;interesting and exciting. The reason for this is that the group never goes too mad, and they keep within musical bounds, using sound discriminatingly, and only when they are needed to convey a feeling.&quot; adding that &quot;Seeing It As You Really Are&quot; is a lesson in electronic music itself. Any group thinking of using weird sounds should listen to this album, it&#x27;s tremendous.&quot;

Members of the band warmly regard the album, many feeling that it was the band&#x27;s best. Various reactions include:

*&quot;That was the great magical album. It was quite daring, I thought&quot; – Dave Brock
*&quot;I remember being a bit apprehensive because Dick Taylor was the main man there and he was an older guitarist — I felt intimidated and didn&#x27;t really enjoy doing it. It was a good album though and I still enjoy hearing it, even now.&quot; – Huw Lloyd-Langton
*&quot;We&#x27;re very much a live band — with the exception of the first album which I had nothing to do with, and which I think was the best studio album Hawkwind&#x27;s done — I think the &quot;Space Ritual&quot; album is the best one we&#x27;ve done, because that was live, that&#x27;s Hawkwind, that&#x27;s us as we are.&quot; – Simon King
*&quot;My fav Gong album, and my fav H-W one, curiously-or obviously, I don&#x27;t know, are records I&#x27;ve not played on... Camembert &amp; Hawkwind (1) !&quot; – Tim Blake
*&quot;Some of the band hated that album, but I thought it was the most musical they did&quot; – Dik Mik

<doc id="565707" wikidata="Q1028827" url="?curid=565707" title="RIVA TNT2">
<text>The RIVA TNT2 is a graphics processing unit manufactured by Nvidia starting in early 1999. The chip is codenamed &quot;NV5&quot; because it is the 5th graphics chip design by Nvidia, succeeding the RIVA TNT (NV4). RIVA is an acronym for Real-timeInteractiveVideo andAnimation accelerator&quot;. The &quot;TNT&quot; suffix refers to the chip&#x27;s ability to work on two [[Texel (graphics)|texel]]s at once (TwiN Texel&quot;). Nvidia removed RIVA from the name later in the chip&#x27;s lifetime.

==Overview==
The TNT2 core features the same basic dual-pipeline layout as the RIVA TNT, however with a few updates, such as larger 2048x2048 texture support, 32-bit Z-buffer/stencil support, AGP 4X support, up to 32MB of VRAM, and a process shrink from 0.35 μm to 0.25 μm. It was the process shrink that enabled improved clock speeds (from 90 MHz to 150+ MHz), which is where the substantial performance improvement came from.

A low-cost version, known as the TNT2 M64, was produced with the memory interface reduced from 128-bit to 64-bit. Sometimes these were labeled &quot;Vanta&quot;, continuing the Vanta name started with a value-oriented RIVA TNT-based product. This chipset outperformed the older RIVA TNT while being less costly to produce. They proved quite popular in the OEM market, as most consumers simply assumed all TNT2 cards were the same.

==Product comparisons==

RIVA TNT2&#x27;s competition included the 3dfx Voodoo2, 3dfx Voodoo3, the Matrox G400, and the ATI Rage 128. The main competitor to the TNT2 was the Voodoo3, which compared to the TNT2 lacked 32-bit color output in 3D. This was a distinguishing point for the TNT2, while the Voodoo3 was marketed under the premise of superior speed and game compatibility. The 3dfx Glide API was still popular at this time, and frequently performed faster and with better image quality than non-vendor locked APIs Direct3D and OpenGL. Some games also had exclusive 3D features when used with Glide, including &quot;Wing Commander: Prophecy&quot;, and the popular &quot;Unreal&quot; had a troubled development history with regards to Direct3D and was plagued by issues such as missing details in this mode.

Voodoo3 cards render internally in 32-bit precision color depth. This is dithered down for the 16-bit framebuffer, which is then postprocessed by a 2x2 box filter in the RAMDAC, dubbed &quot;22-bit equivalent&quot; output by marketing. While this results in markedly less dithering than TNT2&#x27;s 16-bit output, it is not equivalent to real 32-bit output. The postprocessed nature of the effect also meant that framebuffer captures did not display it, which lead to erroneous claims equating TNT2 16-bit quality to Voodoo3 when in many titles of the day Voodoo3 16-bit quality was closer to TNT2 32-bit quality in practice. 32-bit rendering became much more important with heavier use of alphablending and multipass effects in games, however.
The Voodoo3 and TNT2 also differ in that the Voodoo3 has a single dual-texturing pipeline (1x2), while the TNT2 has two single-texturing pipelines (2x1). This means that in games which only put a single texture on a polygon face at once, the TNT2 can be more efficient and faster. However, when TNT2 was launched, single-texturing was no longer used in most new games.

One fact that many hardware review sites noted was that the TNT2 could still be outperformed by two 3dfx Voodoo2 running in SLI mode. In games that supported the Glide API, Voodoo2 SLI setups were able to consistently perform faster and offer better image quality than the TNT2. Voodoo2 cards were more than a year old, but, when combined, could still outperform then-current Nvidia technology.

==Variants==

Falcon Northwest, a high-end PC company, and Guillemot, an international video card manufacturer, at one point cooperated to create the &quot;Falcon Northwest Special Edition Maxi Gamer Xentor 32 SE&quot;. It was a TNT2 Ultra card designed to operate at a record-breaking 195 MHz core and similarly impressive 235 MHz RAM. This was far and away the highest clocked TNT2 model released. The card used special extremely low latency (for the time) 4.3 ns SDRAM to achieve the high RAM clock speed. The regular &quot;Maxi Gamer Xentor 32&quot; came with the core clocked at 175 MHz and memory at either 183 MHz or 195 MHz, depending on which RAM chips the board arrived with.

The Creative &quot;3D Blaster TNT2 Ultra&quot; came clocked at the standard 150 MHz core and 183 MHz RAM. However, Creative included a unique software package that allowed the user to run software that used 3dfx&#x27;s Glide. This wrapper, named &quot;Unified&quot;, was not as compatible with Glide games as real 3dfx hardware, but it was also the only card available other than a 3dfx card that could run Glide software. This Glide wrapper was very slow, not without issues, and was rather unstable. The main use of the wrapper was to allow 3D acceleration of games that only supported Glide 3D accelerators.

Hercules equipped their &quot;Dynamite TNT2 Ultra&quot; with faster-than-stock components, as well. The card came with a 175 MHz core clock and 200 MHz memory. The card lacked TV output, however.

ELSA&#x27;s &quot;Erazor III&quot; came clocked at non-Ultra TNT2 rates but included &quot;3D Revelator&quot; shutter glasses. These glasses made games look as though they were coming out of the screen, and worked with both Direct3D and some OpenGL titles.

==Aladdin TNT2 chipset==
ALi integrated the RIVA TNT2 core into the motherboard chipset Aladdin TNT2. The northbridge ALi M1631 with graphic core was commonly paired with a M1535D southbridge and was prepared for the low-cost Socket 370 motherboards. Aladdin TNT2 offers support for both a local frame buffer (4-32MB) as well as unified memory mode. Frame buffer memory operated at 150 MHz and used 64-bit bus. This lacked an external AGP 4x port for a separate graphic card. With an integrated local frame buffer, TNT2 core offered similar speed compared to the separate TNT2 M64 AGP cards.
Main motherboard manufacturers like Asus prepared boards with the Aladdin TNT2 and local memory. But solution was mostly known from low-cost and low-quality boards without separate memory. Boards like PC-CHIPS M754LMR (used chipset relabelled to PC133 GfX Pro) were known for both low speed and low stability. TNT2 graphic speed was crippled by missing local frame buffer and slow access to the main memory.

<text>Robert Moses State Park – Thousand Islands is a state park located on Barnhart Island in the Saint Lawrence River and the adjacent mainland in the Town of Massena in St. Lawrence County, New York. The park is north of the Village of Massena, near the Canada–US border.

The park is named after former New York Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, who created many of the state parks in New York. It is one of two state parks in New York to bear his name. The other, Robert Moses State Park - Long Island, is in southern New York on Fire Island.

==Park description==
Robert Moses State Park offers a beach, picnic tables with pavilions, a playground, recreation programs, a nature trail, hiking trails through woods and wetlands, fishing, a boat launch and marina, a campground with tent and trailer sites, cabins, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, and a food concession.

Visitors may access the portion of the park on Barnhart Island by traveling through a tunnel below the Eisenhower Locks, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

A nature center offers outdoor education opportunities, and is managed by the Friends of the Robert Moses State Park Nature Center, Inc. As of 2015, the nature center is operating out of facilities at the St. Lawrence Center Mall while construction is completed on a new building at park. The new facility, financed by the New York Power Authority, will replace the former nature center that was destroyed in a March 2010 fire.

A sign near the entrance of the park notes the location where the 45th parallel crosses through the park.

<doc id="565727" wikidata="Q843345" url="?curid=565727" title="Yamcha">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is first introduced as a desert bandit and an antagonist of Son Goku in chapter #7 &quot;Yamcha and Pu&#x27;ar&quot;, published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on September 11, 1984, alongside his constant companion Pu&#x27;ar. He is eventually depicted as being reformed, becoming an ally of Goku. He was initially portrayed as gynophobic, although this characteristic has fluctuated or subsided throughout the original &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; series.

Yamcha has received mixed reviews since his inception, being criticized for his weak abilities compared to other characters, but he has also been praised as being a fun character.

== Creation==
When Toriyama decided to create &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, he used Chinese author Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the West&quot; as a prototype for his own series. Yamcha took the role of Sha Wujing. His name is a pun on a form of Cantonese brunch called &quot;yum cha&quot;. A prototype for Yamcha was Gojō, the river monster, from Toriyama&#x27;s one-shot series &quot;Dragon Boy&quot;.

=== Voice actors ===
In the Japanese version, Yamcha is voiced by Tōru Furuya in all media until he was replaced by Ryōta Suzuki for &quot;Dragon Ball Daima&quot; in 2024. In the Funimation English dub, Yamcha is voiced by Christopher Sabat. Sabat currently voices him in all &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; related media. Ted Cole provided Yamcha’s voice in the Ocean Group dubs of Dragon Ball Z and the BLT dub of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;

== Abilities ==
Though Yamcha is a skilled swordsman he is an exceptional martial artist. His signature technique is the , a quick flurry of punches and kicks. After training with Master Roshi Yamcha became Superhuman gaining Super strength, speed, agility, reflexes, the ability to fly, with telepathy, telekinesis, generate energy from his very being called ki, produce energy blasts, absorb energy and energy blasts and control energy as well as sense energy around him and enhance his abilities by increasing his energy through force of will. He has the ability to perform the &quot;Kamehameha&quot;, a concentrated beam of a &quot;chi&quot; energy blast that many other characters in the series have the ability to perform as well. Yamcha also uses the , a technique that forms a ball of &quot;chi&quot; energy to assault an opponent with. He can fully control the ball, allowing it to home in on enemies and to go underground for a surprise attack.

== Summary ==
Yamcha enters the series ambushing Goku, Bulma, and Oolong as they are traveling through his territory and attempts to rob them of their money and &quot;hoi poi&quot; capsules. He also becomes a student under the Turtle Hermit, known as Master Roshi in the English anime, and loses a long-held fear of women through his relationship with Bulma. Yamcha also enters the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot; along with Goku, but loses in the first round of each tournament, to &quot;Jackie Chun&quot;, Tien Shinhan, and Shen (Kami) respectively. Yamcha is shown to be a baseball player in the anime filler material for &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. This was suggested by the series creator Akira Toriyama.

Yamcha becomes a major league baseball player for the West City Titans. Later, Yamcha is killed along with Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, and Piccolo in a battle against the Saiyans. He is killed when a Saibaiman grabs onto him and self-destructs. Yamcha goes on to train with King Kai in the afterlife just as Goku did, growing greatly in power. Through King Kai, he is able to witness his friends battles on Planet Namek; when Goku is thought to have been killed in the destruction of the Planet Namek after defeating Frieza, Yamcha relays the information to everyone through Bulma. He is later returned to life from a wish to Porunga and continues to live at Capsule Corp with Bulma and, after the two finally end their relationship, she and Vegeta enter a long-term relationship.

During the Android arc, Yamcha is the first to encounter Android #19 and #20, and is left for dead when #20 absorbs his &quot;chi&quot; and drives a hand through his chest. He is healed by a Senzu bean and takes the heart-diseased Goku home to get his medicine after the Super Saiyan loses to #19. Yamcha later joins the others in the Cell Games and teams up with Tien Shinhan to protect the weakened Goku from the Cell Juniors, before losing to them. Following Cell&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Son Gohan and Goku&#x27;s death, Yamcha and the others return to their peaceful lives. In the alternate timeline of the Cell arc, like most of the heroes, Yamcha was killed in the encounter with the Androids.

By the time of the 25th &quot;Tenkaichi Budōkai&quot;, Yamcha has given up fighting and goes with the others to be a spectator and also meet Goku, who is given a single day to return from death. Yamcha is later killed again when Majin Buu turns him into chocolate and eats him, along with Krillin, Bulma, and the other allies. During Goku and Vegeta&#x27;s battle against Buu, Yamcha and Krillin try to fend off the Majin who&#x27;s rampaging the Grand Kai&#x27;s Planet; before he is brought back to life by the Namekian Dragon Balls, and he and the others on Earth give their energy to Goku&#x27;s &quot;Genki-Dama&quot;, which he uses to destroy Majin Buu and restore peace to the universe.

Yamcha returns in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; where he and Puar attend Bulma&#x27;s birthday party along with the other characters, while there he meets Beerus the God of Destruction and later witnessed Goku&#x27;s fight against the deity. Sometime after Frieza&#x27;s 2nd death, he goes with the others to the Nameless Planet to watch the Tournament between Universe 6 and Universe 7. Yamcha plays a prominent role during the baseball match between Universe 6 and Universe 7, he is the team&#x27;s captain uses his newly invented technique (Wolf Fang Pitching Fist) to effortlessly strike out Universe 6 during the first half of the first set, afterwards both Whis and Vados call off the match after Beerus and Champa started fighting physically, not before Vados points down to Yamcha laying at home base, scoring the winning run. During the Universal Survival saga, Yamcha expresses interest in the Tournament of Power, but was ultimately not recruited by Goku.

In the Galactic Patrol Prisoner arc, Yamcha is informed of Moro&#x27;s invasion of Earth and is recruited by Gohan and the Galactic Patrol. Yamcha flies off on his own and easily defeat/subdue 3 of Moro&#x27;s goons, before flying off to the next location. Yamcha soon finds himself in a difficult battle against Saganbo&#x27;s adviser Zauyogi (even with the later assistance of Tien and Chiaotzu). Luckily for the three, Son Goku intervenes and easily beats Zauyogi, Yamcha informs Goku to assist Son Gohan and Piccolo, whilst assuring the Saiyan that he, Tien, and Chiaotzu can handle the rest of the remaining convicts. Yamcha later appears and collectively lends his energy to Vegeta (whom reverse engineers his newfound technique) in order for Goku to re-awaken Mastered Ultra Instinct. Yamcha and the others continue to view the battle, until Goku attains the power-up he needed to finally defeat the earth-infused Moro. Yamcha and the others (barring Vegeta) cheer for Goku&#x27;s victory, and later attended a party hosted at Mr. Satan&#x27;s house.

== Appearances in other media ==
In &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Yamcha makes two cameo appearances.

Yamcha is the main subject of the spin-off manga . Written and illustrated by Dragon Garow Lee, it is about a high school boy who after an accident wakes up in the body of Yamcha in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga. He trains as Yamcha to make him the strongest warrior, having known what happens to him later in the manga against the Saiyans.

Yamcha is a playable character in multiple &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;-related video games, including the &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai&quot; series, the &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi&quot; series, and &quot;Dragon Ball FighterZ&quot;.

Yamcha also appears in an unofficial Chinese live-action remake of the first &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; feature film, played by Cheng Tung-Chuen. Here he is known as Westwood. He joins Monkey Boy, Sparkle, Turtle Man and Seeto in the quest to destroy King Horn and his powerful warriors. He was played by Korean pop singer Joon Park in the film &quot;Dragonball Evolution&quot;, for which James Kyson Lee also auditioned.

== Reception and legacy ==

Yamcha has had mixed reviews during his inception. He is commonly described as useless and outclassed as a fighter in the &quot; Dragon Ball&quot; series yet has also been described as fun and an iconic anime character to other publishers. A few have noted that his most highlighted moments in the anime was in the original anime adaptation compared to the more popular &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; anime. In 2004, Japanese fans voted Yamcha the fifteenth most popular character of the series. He was ranked as the thirty-eighth greatest &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; character of all time by &quot;Complex&quot; describing his willing to sacrifice himself as being the best part of his character.

Yamcha is commonly joked about as one of the weaker fighters by fans of the series. When younger fans would belittle the character as weak, Krillin&#x27;s voice actress Mayumi Tanaka said she would explain to them that Krillin and Yamcha are the strongest earthlings, the other characters are all aliens. Despite this, he has been used as a joke that appears in internet memes, T-shirts and action figures, especially regarding his initial death which has been described as &quot;iconic&quot; and is subject to many parodies and homages. So much so that online writers such as Moviepilot&#x27;s Ak Khan Ten&#x27;s described him as an &quot;iconic troll legend&quot;. He felt that despite being a weaker fighter he still is an important character from the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; mythos since the creation of the manga and felt that he deserves respect as &quot;an iconic Dragon Ball character&quot;. He also described Yamcha as Goku&#x27;s first real rival in the series. He also praised the revealing of him mastering the Spirit Ball technique and also him being the first one who realized that he should cut Goku&#x27;s tail to stop Goku in ape form. Yamcha&#x27;s initial death has inspired a phrase by fans on when somebody dies in the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; universe as being &quot;Yamcha&#x27;d&quot;. Yamcha&#x27;s &quot;death pose&quot; was even referenced in the official &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; anime during the 2016 episode, &quot;A Challenge From Champa! This Time, a Baseball Game!&quot;, in which Yamcha, during a baseball game between Universe 7 and 6, steals home base during a confrontation between God of Destruction Beerus and his brother, Champa. In the ensuing fight between the two Destroyers, Yamcha ends up wounded, laying face down in a crater in the same pose with his hand on home base. Krillin comments that this scene looks familiar.

Furuya, the character&#x27;s voice actor, designates Yamcha as one of the characters by whom he was inspired to create his music, as well as one of the top six favorite characters he voiced. Rebecca Bundy of Anime News Network takes note of resemblance of scars between Yamcha and Kenshin Himura, but also observes that their meaning is quite different. Furuya has expressed dissatisfaction for the way Akira Toriyama handled his character on multiple occasions. The first was the way Yamcha was murdered by a Saibaman despite his constant training during the Saiyan Arc which made him a supporting character in following arcs. The second time he was shocked with Yamcha&#x27;s development was when it was revealed that the character Trunks was Bulma&#x27;s and Vegeta&#x27;s child from the future. This was despite the fact that Yamcha and Bulma were often in a relationship, with Yamcha was being portrayed as a cheater to necessitate this change. Hiromi Tsuru, Bulma&#x27;s first Japanese actress, was also shocked by this change, believing her character would end up with Yamcha. This caused Furuya to protest against Toriyama who said that Yamcha was always a cheater, and proceeded to laugh.

<text>Ovadia Yosef (, ; September 24, 1920 – October 7, 2013) was an Iraqi-born Talmudic scholar, a posek, the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel from 1973 to 1983, and a founder and long-time spiritual leader of Israel&#x27;s ultra-Orthodox Shas party. Yosef&#x27;s responsa were highly regarded within Haredi circles, particularly among Mizrahi communities, among whom he was regarded as &quot;the most important living halakhic authority&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Yosef was born in Baghdad, British occupied Iraq, to Yaakov Ben Ovadia and his wife, Gorgia. In 1924, when he was four years old, he immigrated to Jerusalem, Mandatory Palestine, with his family. In Palestine, the family adopted the surname &quot;Ovadia&quot;. Later in life, he changed his surname to his middle name, &quot;Yosef&quot;, to avoid the confusion of being called &quot;Ovadia Ovadia&quot;.

The family settled in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood of Jerusalem, where Yaakov operated a grocery store. The family was poor, and Yosef was forced to work at a young age. He learned in Talmud Torah B&#x27;nei Zion in the Bukharim quarter, where his passion and skill for Torah study was apparent. His literary career began at age 9 with a commentary on &quot;Reshit Chochmah&quot;, which he penned in the margins.

In 1933, Hakham Sadqa Hussein prevailed upon Yaakov to send his son to Porat Yosef Yeshiva. He soon advanced to the highest shiur taught by the rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Ezra Attiya.

Yosef composed his first sefer, together with two friends, called &quot;Machberet Ha&#x27;atakat Hidot&quot;.

In 1937, Rabbi Yaakov Dweck sent Yosef to give the daily &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot; halakha shiur in his stead at the Ohel Rachel Synagogue for the Persian Jewish community in the Beit Yisrael neighborhood. In the course of giving this shiur, Yosef dissented many times with the stringent opinions of the Ben Ish Hai, who preferred the rulings of the Ari zal over Yosef Karo. This was a defining moment for Yosef, who had found a podium to give air to his opinions, while simultaneously learning how to deal with the negative feedback he was receiving from many in his audience, especially from his fellow Iraqi Jews. A number of notable rabbis, among them Yitzhak Nissim, rebuked him over the years for his positions, even burning his first halakha sefer, &quot;Hazon Ovadia&quot;. But Rabbi Attiya encouraged his student to continue ruling according to his own understanding. Yosef&#x27;s objections on &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot;, for many years in handwritten form only, were printed beginning in 1998 with the appearance of his &quot;Halikhot Olam&quot;.

Yosef received rabbinic ordination at the age of 20. He became a long-time friend of several members of his class who went on to prominent leadership positions in the Sephardi world, such as rabbis Ben Zion Abba Shaul, Baruch Ben Haim, Yehuda Moallem and Zion Levy.

=== Residing in Egypt ===
In 1947, Yosef was invited to Cairo by Rabbi Aharon Choueka, founder of yeshiva &#x27;Ahavah VeAchvah&#x27;, to teach in his yeshiva. Yosef also served, at the request of Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, as head of the Cairo &quot;beth din&quot; (rabbinical court). Yosef considered religious observance to be lax in Egypt, in the Jewish community at large, and among its rabbis. One of the major Halachic issues was the lack of any organised system of Kashrut, which led to conflict between him and other members of the community. It was due to these events that Yosef resigned from his position, just two years after arriving in Cairo. Approximately one year later he returned to what in the meantime had become Israel.

=== Return to Israel ===
Back in Israel, Yosef began studying at midrash &quot;Bnei Zion&quot;, then headed by Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank. He also served on the rabbinical court in Petah Tikva. In his first term as a dayan (rabbinic judge), at the age of 30, he wrote a Halachic ruling favoring Yibbum over Halitza, which contradicted a religious ruling made by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel a year earlier, which had forbidden Yibbum.

In 1951–1952 (תשי&quot;ב by the Jewish calendar), he published his first halakha sefer, &quot;Hazon Ovadia&quot; on the laws of Passover. The book won much praise, and received the approval of the two Chief Rabbis of Israel at the time, Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog. Two years later he founded Or HaTorah Yeshiva for gifted Sephardic Yeshiva students. This Yeshiva (which did not remain open for long) was the first of many which he established, later with the help of his sons, in order to facilitate Torah education for Sephardic Jews, in order to provide leadership for the community in future generations. In 1953-4 (תשי&quot;ד) and 1955-6 (תשט&quot;ז), he published the first two volumes of his major work &quot;Yabia Omer&quot;, which also received much praise.

Between 1958 and 1965, Yosef served as a dayan in the Jerusalem district Beth Din. He was then appointed to the Supreme Rabbinical Court of Appeals in Jerusalem, eventually becoming the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Tel Aviv in 1968, a position which he held until his election as Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel in 1973.

=== Rishon LeZion ===
In 1973, Yosef was elected Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel by a majority vote of 81 to 68, replacing Yitzhak Nissim. His candidacy was criticised by some, as he was competing against an incumbent Chief Rabbi for the first time in the history of that office. The election process was characterised by tension and political controversy because of the Psak Din of the Brother and Sister and due to the tense relations between Yosef and Nissim. In the same election, Rabbi Shlomo Goren was chosen as the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of Israel, the relationship with whom would prove to be difficult. The Council of the Chief Rabbinate was controlled by Goren, and for some time thereafter Yosef decided that there would be no point in attending its sessions.

=== Entry into politics ===

In 1984, Yosef founded the Shas party in response to minimal representation of Sephardic Jews in the Ashkenazi-dominated Agudat Yisrael. It has since become a formidable political force, becoming part of the coalition in most of the elected governments since. He later took a less active role in politics, but remained the party&#x27;s spiritual leader until his death.

=== Assassination plot ===
In April 2005, Israeli security services arrested three people whom the Shin Bet claimed were all members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). They were accused of plotting to kill Yosef. One of the three, Musa Darwish, was convicted on December 15, 2005 of Yosef&#x27;s attempted murder, and of throwing firebombs at vehicles on the Jerusalem-Ma&#x27;aleh Adumim road. He was sentenced to twelve years in prison and three years probation. A second man, Salah Hamouri, proclaimed his innocence of the charges, but eventually accepted a plea bargain sentence of 7 years in exchange for admitting his guilt.

=== Family ===

When Yosef was 24, he married Margalit Fattal (1927–1994), born in Syria, daughter of Rabbi Avraham HaLevi Fattal, when she was 17. They had eleven children.
# Adina Bar-Shalom, (b. 1946) is the founder of the first academic college for Haredi women in Jerusalem, and she studied design at the Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, both with the approval of her father.

# Leah Butbul
# Moshe Yosef, (b. 1966), a rabbi married to Yehudit. Both lived and cared for Yosef in his apartment. Moshe is the head of the Badatz Beit Yosef kashrut agency, and the head of the Maor Yisrael talmud torah, which also publishes the works of his father.

=== Final years and death ===
Yosef resided in the Jerusalem neighbourhood of Har Nof. He would often wear tinted eyeglasses, as his eyes were very sensitive to light. These became a trademark of his persona. Yosef remained an active public figure in political and religious life in his capacity as the spiritual leader of the Shas political party, and through his regular weekly sermons. He was referred to as the Posek HaDor (&quot;Posek of the present generation&quot;), Gadol HaDor (&quot;great/est (one of) the generation&quot;), Maor Yisrael (&quot;The Light of Israel&quot;), and Maran. 

On January 13, 2013, Yosef collapsed during Shacharit at his synagogue in Har Nof, Jerusalem and was having difficulty using his left hand. After he was seen by a physician in his home, he was hospitalized at Hadassah Medical Center after suffering what was believed to be a minor stroke.

On 21 September 2013, because of his worsening health, Yosef was admitted to Hadassah Ein Kerem hospital. Two days after undergoing surgery for the implantation of a pacemaker on September 22, Yosef was sedated and placed on a respirator. He died in the hospital on 7 October 2013 after a &quot;general systemic failure&quot;. His funeral in Jerusalem was the largest in Israel&#x27;s history, with an estimated attendance of 850,000. Some religious authorities have stated that this was, perhaps, the largest in-gathering of Jews since the days of the Second Temple. However, other estimates put the number in attendance at the funeral lower, at between 273,000 and 450,000. He was buried beside his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. During the week-long &quot;shiva&quot; mourning period, Yosef&#x27;s family were expected to receive thousands of condolence callers in a mourning tent set up on their Har Nof street, which police closed to vehicular traffic. Security guards were also posted at the cemetery, where Yosef&#x27;s grave quickly became a pilgrimage site for thousands of men and women.

== Halakhic approach and worldview ==

=== Meta-Halakha: Restoring the past glory ===
Yosef frequently made use of the slogan &quot;Restore past glory&quot; (להחזיר עטרה ליושנה) as a metaphor embodying both his social and halakhic agenda.

On a social level, it is widely viewed as a call to pursue a political agenda that will restore the pride of the Mizrahi Jews (Jews from the Middle East) in Israeli society, which historically suffered from discrimination, and were generally of a lower socio-economic status than their Ashkenazi counterparts.

From a halakhic perspective, the metaphor is more complex. It is widely agreed by Rabbis and secular researchers alike that the &#x27;crown&#x27; of the metaphor refers to the halakhic supremacy which Yosef attaches to the rulings of Rabbi Yosef Karo. According to Yosef&#x27;s approach, Karo is crowned as the Mara D&#x27;Atra of the Land of Israel, and thus all Jews living within his realm of authority should be bound by his rulings. Yosef says this explicitly and in very strong terms in Yalkut Yosef (note that &#x27;Maran&#x27; refers to Rabbi Yosef Karo):

However, there remains some disagreement over who exactly Yosef considers to be bound by the rulings of Karo.

Rabbi Ratzon Arusi argues that Yosef distinguishes between his ideal and the reality. Ideally, all Jews of the Land of Israel should be bound by Karo&#x27;s rulings, but practicality dictates that first all of the Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews should unite under them first. As Arusi puts it,

Tzvi Zohar argues that Yosef adopts a melting pot approach, in that he seeks to unify the traditions of all Jews in Israel, Sephardic and Ashkenazi alike. Zohar claims that Yosef&#x27;s main distinction is not between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, but between the Land of Israel and the Diaspora. In his view, Yosef seeks to apply the rulings of Karo on the entire Land of Israel, but not necessarily outside of it. According to Zohar, this represents an anti-Diaspora and &quot;anti-Colonialist&quot; approach, since it seeks to strip the various immigrant communities of their traditions from their countries of origin and replace them with the custom of the Land of Israel, rather than importing and implanting foreign customs in Israel. He compares between Yosef and religious reformers such as Martin Luther and Muhammad ibn Abd-al-Wahhab, and claims that Yosef has adopted a religious restorative-reformist worldview. Specifically, he argues that Yosef&#x27;s halakhic approach is not, as Yosef attempts to portray it, a return to a traditional form of Sephardic ruling, but rather an innovative formulation of a particular Sephardic approach to Halakha which Yosef himself fashioned.

Rabbi Binyamin Lau disagrees with both of the preceding interpretations. According to Lau, Yosef claims that all Sephardic Jews accepted the rulings of Karo as binding in the Diaspora, but over time deviated from them. Presently, upon their return to the Land of Israel where Karo is the Mara D&#x27;atra, they should return to adhering to his rulings. Thus, Lau believes that Yosef directs his rulings only at Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews, since the Ashkenazi Jews never accepted upon themselves the rulings of Karo. Lau views Yosef as operating on two fronts: the first against the Ashkenazi leadership which seeks to apply Ashkenazi rulings and customs to the Sephardim, and the second against the Sephardic and Mizrahi communities themselves, in demanding that they unite under the rulings of Karo.

In any case, it is agreed that alongside the conservative aspects of his approach to Halacha, there are also significant reforms: his preference for the rulings of Karo, and his preference for leniency over chumra. The fulfillment of his Halakhic vision has entailed significant clashes with his Ashkenazi counterparts. On his predecessors in the post of the Tel Aviv-Yafo Rabbinate, Yosef wrote:

=== Preference for leniency ===
Yosef adopted the Talmudic dictum that, &quot;The power of leniency is greater&quot;. Therefore, one of his fundamental principles of halakhic ruling is that lenient rulings should be preferred over chumra. Yosef saw this as one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Sephardic approach to Halakha, compared to the Ashkenazi approach. In one of his rulings, he quoted Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai as saying:

Yosef considered this principle an ideal, so that if

In Yosef&#x27;s opinion, the severity of Ashkenazi poskim results from their method of teaching, and a lack of familiarity with the Mishnah, Talmud and poskim. In a 1970 article Yosef wrote about Rabbi Jacob Saul Elyashar, he says:

Yosef regarded ruling with severity as especially harmful in the current generation (&quot;the generation of freedom and liberty&quot;), since strict ruling might lead individuals not to comply with the Halakha. Writing in Yabia Omer, he says: &quot;And truly, the growth of chumrot leads to leniency in the body of the Torah.&quot;

==== Examples of lenient rulings ====
Following this principle of leniency Yosef made a number of Halakhic rulings which are significantly more lenient than those made by his Ashkenazi Haredi counterparts. Among them are:

* That it is permissible for boys and girls to study together up to the age of 9.
* That a married woman who covers her hair may expose a few centimeters of hair from beneath the covering at the front.
* That it is permissible for a female widow or divorcée to wear a wig as a head covering, despite prohibiting it for married women (see below).
* That it is permissible for unmarried women to leave their hair loose and untied.
* That, when investigating whether a person might be a &quot;mamzer&quot;, as much plausible deniability as possible ought to be granted, so as to avoid condemning the person to &quot;mamzer&quot; status.

==== The least of evils ====
Yosef aimed to encourage maximal observance of Mitzvot among as many Israelis as possible. In order to achieve this, &quot;he is willing to follow a halakhic policy which, on the one hand, will minimize violations of the halakha, but on the other, concedes absolute adherence to the halakha&quot;. This is evident in a number of his rulings: providing kashrut certification to a restaurant that serves milk and meat; the slaughter of a chicken where there is a concern of it being trefa; and the wearing of pants by women.

==== Turning a blind eye ====
Yosef applied a policy of turning a blind eye to deviations from the halakha in circumstances where, if strict adherence to the halakha were required, it is likely that it would not be followed at all. Examples of this include the recital of the priestly benediction by Kohanim who do not have a religious lifestyle, and a shaliach tzibur or person performing a Torah reading who shaves with a razor.

=== Sinai Adif ===
In the Talmudic debate over Sinai and Oker Harim, Yosef was of the opinion that Sinai is preferable. Specifically, he emphasizes that the Sephardic system of learning, which emphasizes learning Halakha in depth, is superior to the common approach in many Ashkenazi schools, which relies on deep analysis of gemara employing pilpul, without reaching to the halakhic conclusions. This preference is based upon his support for ruling halakha on practical contemporary issues rather than ruling halakha as a purely theoretical pursuit. In a eulogy he wrote for Rabbi Yaakov Ades, his teacher at Porat Yosef Yeshiva, he said:

According to Yosef, the preoccupation with pilpul at the expense of learning halakha in depth causes lack of knowledge among Ashkenazi poskim, which in turn leads to unnecessary severity in making halakhic rulings, since the Posek is unaware of lenient rulings and approaches to Halakha used by previous Rabbis upon which the Posek could rely to rule leniently.

=== Attitude towards kabbalah ===
Yosef was sometimes willing to accept rulings which rely on the rulings of the Ari zal, provided that these do not contradict rulings by Karo. In some instances, particularly in Jewish prayer, Yosef championed Kabbalistic considerations - even at the expense of Karo&#x27;s rulings. Nevertheless, in many cases, he came out strongly against the rulings, saying, &quot;We have no business with mysticism&quot;, and rejecting rulings based upon the Zohar, and the Kabbalah more generally. This position is contrary to many (but not all) traditional long-standing Sephardic rulings on Halakha, including by many Sephardic poskim to this day. In contrast with the position of Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai, who wrote that, &quot;None may reply after the Ari&quot; (that is, none may dispute the rulings of the Ari), Yosef argues that no special weight should be attached to the rulings of the Ari, and the ordinary principles of Halakhic ruling should continue to apply. He wrote:

Yosef&#x27;s attitude towards the Kabbalah, the rulings of the Ari, and consequently the rulings of the Ben Ish Hai have been the cause of strong disagreements between him and Jewish immigrants from the Muslim world in Israel, especially the Jews of Iraq. The rulings of the Ben Ish Chai were at the heart of the disagreement between him and the Chief Rabbis Yitzhak Nissim and Mordechai Eliyahu.

=== Attitude towards minhag and traditions ===
Yosef gave strong preference to the written word, and did not attribute significant weight to minhagim and traditions which are not well anchored in the Halakha. For example, he expressed opposition to two minhagim observed in the Synagogues of North African Jewry: standing during the reading of the Ten Commandments, and the involvement of the congregation in certain parts of the prayer service. His attempts to change popular and deeply rooted traditions have led to opposition to his approach among some North African Rabbis.

Breslov Hasidim have the custom of going on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov in Uman for Rosh Hashanah. Yosef has been highly critical of this practice, and has stated:

== Attitude towards the State of Israel and its citizens ==

=== Ethiopian Jews ===
Ovadia Yosef is often regarded as the pivotal force behind bringing Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In the 1970s, Yosef ruled that Ethiopian Jews were halachically Jewish and campaigned for the Ethiopian aliyah to Israel. Pnina Tamano-Shata said of Yosef: &quot;I started crying, probably in gratitude to all that he&#x27;s done, the humane form of address, &#x27;our brothers.&#x27; He was also a leader. He called on the authorities to save Ethiopia&#x27;s Jews and bring them to Israel. It shows his great love for others.&quot;

=== Attitude to Zionism ===

Yosef held a Halakhically ambivalent view towards Zionism as the Atchalta D&#x27;Geulah (beginning of the redemption). Many Religious Zionists, in contrast, view Israel as the first flowering of the redemption. In a Halakhic ruling regarding Israeli Independence Day, Yosef acknowledged that the Jewish people experienced a miracle with the establishment of the State of Israel; however, since the miracle did not include all of the Jewish people,

Yosef&#x27;s position could be seen as a middle ground between the Religious Zionists, for whom saying Hallel is compulsory, and the Ashkenazi Haredim, who do not say Hallel at all.

In a newspaper interview in which Shas was accused of being anti-Zionist, Yosef responded:

In 2010, Yosef and Shas&#x27; Moetzet Chachamei HaTorah (Council of [Wise] Torah Sages) approved Shas&#x27; membership in the World Zionist Organization, making Shas the first officially Zionist Haredi party in Israel.

=== Yeshiva students and military service ===
Yosef regarded the wars fought by the State of Israel as falling within the Halakhic classification of Milkhemet Mitzvah. Nevertheless, he encouraged young students to remain in the Yeshivas, rather than be drafted into the military, because, &quot;despite the sensitivity which Rabbi Yosef feels towards the Israel Defense Forces, he is deeply rooted in the Rabbinic tradition of the Yeshivas in the Land of Israel, and holds their position which opposes the integration of Yeshiva students in the military&quot;. Rabbi Binyamin Lau makes a cautious distinction between Yosef&#x27;s public rhetoric, which presents a unified front with the Ashkenazi Haredim, and between internal discussions, where Yosef was said to be more receptive to solving the problem of integrating the Haredim into the military.

Yosef&#x27;s grandson points out his grandfather&#x27;s positive attitude towards the IDF, in that whenever the Torah Ark is opened, Yosef blesses &quot;mi sheberech&quot; for IDF soldiers. Yosef&#x27;s son, Rabbi Avraham Yosef, served in the IDF as a military Rabbi for 13 years.

=== Secular Israelis ===
Yosef frequently referred to the present situation in Israeli and Jewish society as &quot;the generation of freedom and liberty&quot;. By this, Yosef referred to a modern reality of a Jewish community which is generally not committed to the Halakha, and where Rabbinic authority has lost its centrality. In this context, Yosef drew a distinction between those who profess a secular ideology, and those who are non-observant merely in the sense of a weak or incomplete commitment to Halakha accompanied by a strong belief in God and the Torah:

This latter kind of non-observant Jews are, in Israel, mainly Mizrahi Jews who practice aspects of Judaism as a tradition (known as Masortiyim, not to be confused with Conservative Judaism, which is sometimes called Masorti Judaism). Yosef sought to bring this demographic closer to the Torah, while relying upon traditional Jewish sources for his rulings. For example, he ruled that those who desecrate the Sabbath are not to be considered as having abandoned the Torah, and therefore if they have touched wine, it remains Kosher. This sort of ruling differs from Ashkenazi Haredi rulings. Yosef actively aims to engage in Kiruv, while still strictly adhering to Halacha.

Yosef, however, had no sympathy towards Israeli Jews who profess a secular lifestyle. His opinion was to fully exclude them from the Jewish community. For Yosef, the secularist Israeli public are secular out of &#x27;spitefulness&#x27; towards Torah, and he likened them to idolatrous apostates.

=== Israeli legal system ===
Yosef was opposed to bringing civil actions in the Israeli courts, because they decide outcomes by applying Israeli law, rather than Halakha. His opposition is consistent with the position of the Ashkenazi Haredi Rabbis, and some Religious Zionist Rabbis (e. g., Yaakov Ariel) as well. On this matter, Yosef has written:

In matters of criminal law, however, Yosef is among the moderate Rabbinic voices who support the application of the rule dina d&#x27;malchuta dina (&#x27;the law of the land is the law&#x27;), and therefore, it is forbidden to engage in criminal conduct such as tax fraud. It is only in civil matters that he forbade going to the Israeli courts.

In February 1999, Yosef caused a controversy by strongly criticizing the Supreme Court of Israel:

Following these statements, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel petitioned the Supreme Court of Israel, demanding that Yosef be put on trial. The Supreme Court dismissed the application, saying that the comments were within Yosef&#x27;s right to freedom of speech. Nevertheless, then-Supreme Court President Aharon Barak wrote in his judgement:

=== Political activity ===

==== Government influence ====

In 1990, Yosef used his position as Shas spiritual leader to pressure Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir into agreeing to hold negotiations with Arab states for a peaceful settlement of the Arab–Israeli conflict. Shamir, a member of the Likud Party, refused to make any commitments.

According to one biography of the rabbi, &quot;Ben Porat Yosef&quot;, the relationship between the two had never been comfortable because of Shamir&#x27;s unstudious personality. As a way of gaining a character analysis of politicians, Yosef had invited both Shamir and Shimon Peres to learn Talmud with him. While Peres proved an engaging and fluid learner, Shamir was stoic toward the material, a trait that led Yosef to instead use one of Shamir&#x27;s cabinet members, Housing and Construction Minister David Levy, as his key partner in dealing with the Likud. Levy had a relatively warm relationship with the rabbi due to his moderate approach to Israel&#x27;s security and foreign affairs policies, his charismatic personality, and his connection with Sephardi traditions (Levy, a Moroccan, was the highest ranking Sephardi politician in the 1980s).

In 1990, Rav Yosef pulled Shas out of the coalition with the Likud and attempted to form a partnership with Peres&#x27;s left-centre Labor Party. The bold move, engineered but opposed by Shas chairman Aryeh Deri, backfired when the highly respected Ashkenazi rosh yeshiva (dean) of the Ponevezh Yeshiva in Bnei Brak, Rabbi Elazar Shach (who subsequently founded the Degel HaTorah party) fiercely commanded Yosef to return Shas to the coalition with the Likud. During this time, Yosef was severely criticised by other major members of the Haredi religious community in Israel, particular the Ashkenazic Jews who generally sided with the Likud and the right in opposition to the perceived secularist tendencies of Labour and the left.

The failure of the scheme, known as the stinking trick, was responsible for Peres&#x27; downfall as leader of Labour, and his 1991 defeat in internal elections to former Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin. From the 1980s until his death, Yosef approved the participation by Shas in most Israeli governments, except for the last two governments of Ariel Sharon from January 2003 and August 2005. In that Knesset (2003-2006), Shas was one of the few parties to have been in the opposition for the duration of that Knesset&#x27;s term, along with the leftist Meretz party and the Arab factions &quot;Ra&#x27;am&quot; (United Arab List), &quot;Hadash&quot;, and &quot;Balad&quot;. This was largely because of the rise of Shinui to the powerful third party position, a position that was previously held by Shas. Shinui demanded the creation of a government without Shas.

In the 2007 Israeli Presidential election, Yosef endorsed his long-time friend Shimon Peres, who ultimately won the election due in part to the support of Shas&#x27;s 12 MKs.

==== Cultural influence ====
In a 2004 article by &quot;Maariv&quot;, Yosef was listed as one of the most influential rabbis in Israel. He was described as:

==== Position on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict ====
Despite his controversial public comments, Yosef had long been a rabbinical authority advocating peace negotiations in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and had done so since the late 1980s. His main justification was the halakhic principle of &quot;Pikuach Nefesh&quot;, in which all the Jewish commandments (excluding adultery, idolatry, and murder) are put on hold if a life is put in danger. Using an argument first articulated by the late American rabbinical leader Joseph Soloveitchik, Yosef claimed that the Arab–Israeli conflict endangers human lives, thereby meeting the above criteria and overruling the priority of commandments pertaining to settling the land of Israel. Therefore, Israel is permitted—even obligated if saving lives is a definitive outcome—to make serious efforts to reach a peace settlement, as well as to make arrangements to properly protect its citizens. Yosef first applied the &quot;Pikuach Nefesh&quot; principle to Israel&#x27;s conflicts with its neighbors in 1979, when he ruled that this argument granted Israel authority to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt. Some claimed, however, that the ruling was also motivated by Yosef&#x27;s desire to oppose his Ashkenazi colleague, Rabbi Shlomo Goren.

Using this precedent, Yosef instructed Shas to join Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s government coalition, and later that of Ehud Barak as well. However, Shas abstained on Oslo I and voted against the Oslo II agreement. Furthermore, as Oslo stalled, and relations between Israelis and Palestinians began to deteriorate, and particularly following the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Yosef and the party pulled &quot;rightward&quot;, supporting the Likud.

In 2005, Yosef repeatedly condemned the Gaza Disengagement. He argued that he was opposed to any unilateral action that occurred outside the framework of a peace agreement. Yosef again cited the principle of &quot;Pikuach Nefesh&quot;, saying that empowering the Palestinians without a commitment to end terror would result in threatening Jewish lives, particularly in areas near Gaza in range of Qassam rocket attacks. In contrast to some of his rabbinical colleagues, such as Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Yosef refused to entertain the idea of holding a referendum on the disengagement, and instructed his MKs to vote against the plan when it came up in the Knesset.

Yosef always maintained that &quot;Pikuach Nefesh&quot; applies to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and supported negotiations with the Palestinians. However, toward the end of his life, he no longer appeared totally convinced that diplomacy with the PA leadership would necessarily end the violence. Some media analysts had suggested that then Prime Minister Ehud Olmert may have been able to convince the rabbi to sign on to further unilateral actions by the government if concerted efforts toward negotiation failed.

Yosef protested strongly against demands by the United States and other foreign countries that Israel freeze construction in East Jerusalem, saying that, &quot;It&#x27;s as if we are their slaves&quot;. However, toward the end of his life, he indicated some flexibility on the issue, and may have taken a more pragmatic approach. In the wake of the diplomatic row between Israel and the US over Jewish housing in east Jerusalem, Yosef is reported to have said, in a private meeting with Shimon Peres, that &quot;it is not permissible to challenge the nations of the world or the ruling powers&quot;, and that Israel should agree to a partial building freeze in East Jerusalem, at least temporarily.

== Halakhic rulings ==

Yosef is generally considered one of the leading halakhic authorities, particularly for Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, who bestowed upon him the honorific title of &quot;Maran&quot;.

Some of his more famous legal rulings include:

* In 1973, as Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel, he ruled, based on the Radbaz and other opinions, that the Ethiopian Beta Israel were Jews and should be brought to Israel. He was later joined by a number of other authorities who made similar rulings, including the Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi Shlomo Goren. Other notable poskim, from non-Zionist Ashkenazi circles, placed a halakhic &quot;safek&quot; (doubt) over the Jewishness of the Beta Israel. Such dissenting voices include Rabbis Elazar Shach, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv, Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, and Moshe Feinstein.
* That it is legitimate and permissible to give territory from the Land of Israel in order to achieve a genuine peace. When the Oslo Accords were followed by an intifada, this opinion was later retracted.
* Supported the sale of the land during the Sabbatical year, following the Sephardic tradition.
* That it is prohibited for fellow Jews to ascend the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, in this day and age, due to its extreme sanctity and the people&#x27;s inability to purify themselves with the ash-water of the Red Heifer.
* Ordered the Shas political party to vote in favour of a law recognizing brain death as death for legal purposes. The Ashkenazi Haredi political party United Torah Judaism voted against the law on instructions from their spiritual leader Rabbi Yosef Shalom Eliashiv.
* Allowing the wives of Israel Defense Forces soldiers who have been missing in action for a long time to remarry, a verdict which is known as &quot;the release of agunot&quot; (התרת עגונות).
* That a woman should not wear a wig (&quot;sheitel&quot;) as a form of hair covering, but should wear headscarves (or snoods / hats / berets) instead. (According to Jewish Law, married women must cover their hair in public for reasons of modesty. Some Ashkenazi Haredi women have the practice of wearing sheitels for this purpose.)

== Controversial statements ==
Yosef made countless political remarks which aroused controversy. Statements deemed offensive relating to various groups and individuals were claimed by his supporters to have been taken out of context, although the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League condemned what they termed his &quot;hate speech&quot;. He claimed the Holocaust was God&#x27;s retribution against the reincarnated souls of Jewish sinners. He also claimed that Israeli soldiers were killed in battle on account of their non-observance of Torah law. He was criticised for supporting the traditional role of women and minimising their capabilities. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he blamed the tragedy on U.S. support for the Gaza disengagement, and on a general lack of Torah study in the area where the hurricane occurred. In 2009, he said about Yisrael Beitenu and its leader &quot;whoever votes for Avigdor Lieberman gives strength to Satan&quot;.

=== Recommendations of the Plesner Committee ===
In 2013, Yosef called for yeshiva students to emigrate from Israel rather than agree to serve in the army, stating:

In October 2013, immediately following Ovadia Yosef&#x27;s death, his son, David Yosef stated to the Prime Minister that the drafting of Haredi students into the army had hurt him in his final months more than his physical illnesses.

=== Arabs and Palestinians ===

In 2001, Yosef was quoted as saying of the Arabs:

Yosef later said that his sermon was misquoted, that he was referring to annihilation of Islamic terrorism, and not of all Arabs. He called for improving the living conditions of the Arab people in Israel, and said that he has deep respect for peace-seeking Arabs.

Israeli Justice Minister Meir Sheetrit condemned the sermon, saying: &quot;A person of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef&#x27;s stature must refrain from acrid remarks such as these... I suggest that we not learn from the ways of the Palestinians and speak in verbal blows like these.&quot;

Yosef drew criticism from the US State Department in August 2010 following a Saturday morning sermon in which he called for

Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Yosef&#x27;s statements were tantamount to a call for genocide against Palestinians, and demanded a firm response from the Israeli government. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu distanced himself and his government from the sermon, stating that Yosef&#x27;s words &quot;do not reflect my approach, or the stand of the Israeli government&quot;.

The rabbi said he regretted his statements, and was said to have looked for a way of sending a conciliatory message to the Palestinians. Three weeks later, Yosef sent out a conciliatory message reiterating his old positions in support of the peace process. He wished the Palestinians and their leaders,

=== Remarks regarding gentiles ===
In a sermon he delivered in October 2010, Yosef was strongly condemned (including, among others, by the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee) after stating that &quot;the sole purpose of non-Jews is to serve Jews&quot;. In his sermon, he said:
&quot;Goyim were born only to serve us. Without that, they have no place in the world – only to serve the People of Israel.&quot; 

In Israel, death has no dominion over them... With gentiles, it will be like any person – they need to die, but [God] will give them longevity. Why? Imagine that one’s donkey would die, they&#x27;d lose their money.
This is his servant... That’s why he gets a long life, to work well for this Jew,&quot; Yosef said.

&quot;Why are gentiles needed? They will work, they will plow, they will reap. We will sit like an effendi and eat. 

That is why gentiles were created&quot;

== Published works ==
Among Yosef&#x27;s earliest work was a detailed commentary on the &quot;Ben Ish Hai&quot; titled &quot;Halikhot Olam&quot;. He was asked to finish the commentary &quot;Kaf Ha&#x27;Chaim&quot; by Rabbi Yaakov Chaim Sofer after the author&#x27;s death. Two sets of Yosef&#x27;s &quot;responsa&quot; have been published, &quot;Yabia Omer&quot; and &quot;Yechaveh Da&#x27;at&quot; (both titles are references to Psalm 19). His &quot;responsa&quot; are noted for citing almost every source regarding a specific topic and are often referred to simply as indices of rulings. There is also another series of books under the title of &quot;Hazon Ovadia&quot; (not to be mistaken with the original books, which were responsa on Passover), which he has written concerning laws of &quot;Shabbat&quot;, holidays, and other topics.

Yosef printed a commentary on the Mishnah tractate Pirkei Avot (&quot;Ethics of the Fathers&quot;) under the title &quot;Anaf Etz Avot&quot;, and &quot;Maor Israel&quot;, a commentary on various parts of the Talmud. His son, Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, has published a widely read codification of Yosef&#x27;s rulings entitled &quot;Yalkut Yosef&quot;. Another son, Rabbi David Yosef, has printed various siddurim and liturgy according to his father&#x27;s rulings, and another halachic compendium entitled &quot;Halachah Berurah&quot;.

In 1970, Yosef was awarded the Israel Prize for Rabbinical literature.

<text>Graham Vivian &quot;Polly&quot; Farmer (10 March 1935 14 August 2019) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Geelong Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL) and the East Perth Football Club and West Perth Football Club in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL).

Born in Western Australia and of indigenous heritage through his Noongar mother, Farmer is considered one of the greatest footballers in the game&#x27;s history; when the Australian Football Hall of Fame was established in 1996, Farmer was among the 12 inaugural players given &quot;legend&quot; status. He is primarily recognised for the way he revolutionised ruckwork and handballing.

After retiring as a player, Farmer returned to Geelong to become the VFL&#x27;s first coach of indigenous background, and he was also named coach of Western Australia&#x27;s first State of Origin team.

The Graham Farmer Freeway in his hometown of Perth is named in his honour.

==Early life==
Farmer was born at the Hillcrest Maternity Home in North Fremantle to an unknown man and 25-year-old Noongar woman from Katanning named Eva. At the time of Farmer&#x27;s birth, Australia was slowly recovering from the Great Depression, and A. O. Neville was Western Australia&#x27;s Chief Protector of Aborigines. In December 1936, Farmer was voluntarily placed in the care of Sister Kate&#x27;s orphanage in Queens Park, Western Australia, a home for &quot;half-caste&quot; children. Farmer never found out why he had been put there, though it is presumed that Farmer&#x27;s unmarried mother did not have the means to provide for him.

Nonetheless, Farmer was grateful to Sister Kate&#x27;s for his upbringing: &quot;If it had not been for Sister Kate&#x27;s, I would have had an ice block&#x27;s hope in hell of ever leading a normal life. I owe her and all her dedicated helpers everything – for giving me the chance to make something of myself. I was one of the lucky ones.&quot; A bout of poliomyelitis left Farmer with his left leg shorter than his right leg. According to Farmer, he was nicknamed &quot;Polly the Parrot&quot; as a six-year-old because people thought he chattered away like a parrot. At high school, Farmer was spotted by talent scouts for the East Perth Football Club and joined the team.

==Football career==
===East Perth===

Farmer began his top-level career in the West Australian Football League (WAFL), known then as the West Australian National Football League (WANFL), with the East Perth Football Club in 1953. He played 176 games from 1953 to 1961 with East Perth. During this time he won the club&#x27;s fairest and best award seven times and was a member of their 1956, 1958 and 1959 premiership teams. In 1956, he was awarded a Simpson Medal for his performance against South Australia at the Perth Carnival and later was also awarded the Tassie Medal for being judged best at the carnival overall. He was awarded the WANFL&#x27;s highest individual honour, the Sandover Medal, in 1956 and 1960. He also tied for the medal in 1957 with East Fremantle&#x27;s Jack Clarke but lost on a countback; he was awarded that medal in 1997 when the WAFL awarded retrospective medals for those who missed out on countbacks. In 1959, he was awarded the Simpson Medal for being best on ground in the grand final. He was awarded another Simpson Medal in 1961 for his game against Victoria at the Brisbane Carnival.

===Geelong===

Farmer had clear ambitions to play football in Victoria, and had attracted interest from Victorian clubs; at the end of 1955 he was signed by the Richmond Football Club for £200 (as was not uncommon at the time), but the move was blocked by East Perth, and he remained in Perth for the next six years. He was later recruited by Bob Davis to the Geelong Football Club in 1962. In the opening moments of his debut for Geelong in 1962, Farmer severely injured a knee, causing ligament damage and missed the rest of the season. He returned in 1963, winning a premiership with Geelong and coming equal-second in the Brownlow Medal behind Bob Skilton. Farmer played 101 games for Geelong from 1962 to 1968, won the team&#x27;s fairest and best award in 1963 and 1964 and captained the team from 1965 until 1967.

On 6 July 1963 he was a member of the Geelong team that were comprehensively and unexpectedly beaten by Fitzroy, 9.13 (67) to 3.13 (31) in the 1963 Miracle Match.

Farmer practised handballing through car windows at the car yard where he worked and one of his football legacies is changing handballing from a last-resort option to a &quot;dangerous offensive weapon&quot;. According to Geelong player Sam Newman, &quot;without speaking one word he [Farmer] taught me everything I know. I watched how a man overcomes not the physical, not the mental, but the spiritual – that&#x27;s the most important – he was an absolute star, about one decade, one century ahead of his time&quot;.

One tactic opposition players tried in order to distract Farmer was racial abuse, but to no avail, as he related to historian Sean Gorman: 
I never took any notice of it. I think anything that was said out on the field was to put people off, but it didn’t break my concentration and when I was called names I’d look at myself and say to myself well I can’t see it. It never worried me. I still was called ‘You boong, you nigger.’ That was understandable because you do anything to try and put people off their game. I didn’t go out of my way to chase people and thump them because they called me a boong.

===West Perth===
In 1968, Farmer desired to return home to Western Australia. Although he had trained briefly with East Perth during 1967 as part of a testimonial to retired Royal teammate &quot;Square&quot; Kilmurray, Farmer accepted the role of captain/coach with the West Perth Football Club, rivals to his former club, East Perth. He led West Perth to premierships in 1969 and 1971, both times defeating East Perth in the grand final. In 1969, Farmer received his fourth Simpson Medal during the AFC Championships in Adelaide, and also played his 300th career game during the season.

In 1971, he played his 346th career game in Round 11 (245th in the WANFL) to break David &quot;Dolly&quot; Christy&#x27;s long-standing elite Australian rules football games record, and also became the first player in elite Australian rules football to play 350 career games. Farmer retired after the Grand Final aged 36, after 79 games with West Perth and a career total of 356 games, which remained a record until broken by Kevin Murray in Round 2 of the 1974 VFL season (Murray retired at the end of that season with 377 games in the VFL and WANFL).

Farmer also played 31 games for Western Australia and five games for Victoria in interstate football, and four International Rules matches on the 1968 Australian Football World Tour (which are counted as senior by the VFL/AFL); if these are included, he played a total of 396 career senior games, which remained a record until broken by Murray in either of Round 12 of 1974 (using the VFL/AFL&#x27;s totals), Round 13 of 1973 (excluding Farmer&#x27;s International Rules matches) or Round 17 of 1973 (including Farmer&#x27;s International Rules matches).

==Non-playing coach==
Not involved in top-level football in 1972, Farmer returned to the VFL as coach of the Geelong Football Club in time for the 1973 VFL season. Shortly after taking up the position, Farmer travelled to Canberra in an attempt to personally persuade Manuka Football Club&#x27;s star rover Edney Blackaby to join Geelong. Blackaby had signed a Form Four with the Cats, but not even Farmer&#x27;s star power and a lucrative contract were enough to convince Blackaby to leave Canberra.&lt;br&gt; 
Farmer&#x27;s tenure as Geelong coach was generally regarded as a disappointment, with a sixth-placed finish in 1974 their best result. One issue was that he assumed his players would adhere to all training instructions and be disciplined in their preparation, just as he was in his playing days. He also found it difficult to relate to players who were less naturally gifted. Farmer and the club&#x27;s committee had an increasingly strained relationship and Farmer quit in 1975. 
A six-game losing streak in the second half of the season spelled the end of Farmer&#x27;s time as coach. Geelong ensured that he bowed out on a positive note with a surprise 26-point win over at VFL Park.

Farmer returned to the WANFL, coaching East Perth from 1976 to 1977 with some success and he coached the first Western Australian state of origin team in 1977. Farmer was sacked as coach of East Perth in 1977 due to conflict and replaced by Barry Cable in 1978. Farmer said, &quot;When the going gets tough a club should stick together and fight to beat it. But some people chip and chip at the ground underneath you in trying to find someone to blame. I do my best in football and I have no time to protect my back, so it&#x27;s left wide open. Maybe that&#x27;s a lot of my trouble.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
In 1956, Farmer met Marlene Gray, a Tasmanian woman holidaying in Perth. They married in 1957 and had three children: two sons, Brett and Dean, and daughter Kim. In the 1960s, former Geelong player Neil Trezise approached Farmer about representing the Australian Labor Party in the seat of Corio. Farmer declined.

The couple sold their house in 1992 and ran a two-star Southway Auto Lodge motel in South Perth until 1998. Farmer said the business failed due to the downturn in the Asian economy and a 40% drop in tourist numbers. It left him with no money or assets. He said, &quot;We have nothing and we are back to square one. But we didn&#x27;t borrow money to keep the business going. All my life I have helped myself and there is no reason why I can&#x27;t still do that.&quot; Farmer and Marlene were given temporary accommodation at the caretaker&#x27;s flat in the Main Roads building. Two fundraising events were organised in Perth and Melbourne by John Watts, Bob Davis and Sam Newman, raising $120,000. A trust fund was established with the money and a small villa was bought in Innaloo.

In 1999, Farmer was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, but it was not until 2012 that his wife Marlene, who was battling breast cancer, decided to reveal it publicly. He died at the Fiona Stanley Hospital on 14 August 2019, aged 84. He was given a state funeral, held at Perth Stadium, on 26 August. He was survived by his three children, his wife Marlene having died in 2015.

After his death, Farmer&#x27;s brain was donated to the Australian Sports Brain Bank. A study of his brain by researchers at the bank identified chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Farmer is the first former VFL/AFL player to be diagnosed with the condition.

==Legacy==

In 1971, Farmer became the first Australian footballer to receive a Queen&#x27;s honour when he was named a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the New Year honours list. Farmer&#x27;s name was included in the 150 bronze tablets set into the footpath along St Georges Terrace that commemorate notable figures in Western Australia&#x27;s history, as part of the WAY 1979 celebrations. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985.

In 1994, Steve Hawke, author and son of former prime minister Bob Hawke, met with Farmer to discuss writing his biography. In return, Farmer asked for Hawke&#x27;s help to create the Polly Farmer Foundation, an organization dedicated to supporting indigenous children in their sporting and academic endeavours. Farmer explained, &quot;I want the foundation to be of practical assistance to young Aboriginal people with potential to do something with their lives … Not just sport, but in the professions and business. We want to develop links with the tertiary institutions and make sure Aboriginal people become leaders.&quot; Hawke enlisted the help of recently retired federal politicians Ron Edwards and Fred Chaney to establish the foundation, and was joined by Sir Ronald Wilson, a former High Court judge; and Greg Durham, chief executive of the Geelong Football Club.

On 6 October 1997, Western Australian Transport Minister Eric Charlton announced that the $400 m Northern City Bypass would be named the Graham Farmer Freeway. Charlton said, &quot;He already has a place in WA sporting folklore and it is fitting that a showpiece of the city&#x27;s transport network should bear his name… The northern traffic bypass system links West Perth and East Perth which are, coincidentally, the two districts which Graham Farmer represented with distinction on the football arena&quot;.

He was inducted into the inaugural Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the twelve official &quot;Legends&quot; and then into the West Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2004. He has been nominated as the first ruckman in every Team of the Century for each of the two leagues and three clubs for which he participated, plus the Indigenous Team of the Century, in which he was the captain. In 2008, Farmer was named at number 5 in &quot;The Age&quot;″s top football players of all time. Farmer is depicted contesting a boundary throw-in with Carlton ruckman John Nicholls (the other ruckman in the AFL Team of the Century) in Jamie Cooper&#x27;s painting &quot;The Game That Made Australia&quot;, commissioned by the AFL in 2008 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the sport.

Farmer is also depicted in the rare 1963 Scanlens football card series, which, due to production problems during the printing process, is now considered one of the rarest and most valuable trading cards in Australia.

Upon Farmer&#x27;s death, tributes came flowing in from his contemporaries. Carlton legend John Nicholls, whose ruck rivalry with Farmer was compulsory viewing for football fans in the 1960s, reflected fondly on their on-field contests and enduring friendship:

As a person, ‘Polly’ was a good man. He has been a friend of mine for the best part of 60 years. As a player he was talked about as ahead of his time . . . and he was a freak. ‘Polly’ and I probably played against each other 15 or 20 times. In all those times I can honestly say I don’t think he ever beat me - but then again, I don’t think I beat him either. We probably nullified each other.
At ruck contests the pair of us used to take two or three steps - never a long run. At centre bounces he jumped early and umpires like Jeff Crouch used to let him get away with it. I gave away height to ‘Polly’ and I realized that if I jumped at the same time as him I was gone, so I jumped into him early, body on body, and I was successful at it because I had a good spring. [...] He was one of the first to really perfect the art of handballing. He was very good at it. He was a brilliant footballer, I learnt a lot from him, he made me a better player and I respected him. He was a good friend of mine, a very good friend.

Fellow Western Australian indigenous football legend Barry Cable, whose career overlapped with Farmer, reflected on his unique style of ruck play:

I don’t think there’s any doubt he was the greatest ruckman in Aussie rules – he led the way in that area, he had a very unique game. People say he changed the style of ruckman but I feel he was the only one who could do what he could do. He had a special game and ruck play all of his own, and no one has ever been able to follow it. There was no one who did it before him and no one’s ever done it after him.

On behalf of the AFL, chief executive Gillon McLachlan issued this statement:

When discussing ruckmen, every player who saw him play or took the field against him, deferred to Polly. Our game has always started in the centre square, with a contest between two big men, and Polly was the greatest of all the big men who seek to set the standard of competitiveness for their teams, lead from the front at every contest and compel their teammates to match their skills and commitment in the pursuit of victory. Beyond football, as a proud Noongar man, he was a leader for the Aboriginal community and his standing in the game and in society enabled his people to believe that they too could reach the peaks and achieve their best potential. He laid the path for so many great footballers from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to come into the elite levels of the game and showcase their skills. At every point of his career, his teams found success on the field, thanks largely to his dominance that built a record that few players could ever hope to match.

<text>Wellesley Island State Park is a state park located on Wellesley Island in the St. Lawrence River in the Town of Orleans in Jefferson County, New York. The park is divided into sections that are on different parts of the island. It has the largest camping complex in the Thousand Islands region, including wilderness campsites on the banks of the St. Lawrence accessible only by foot or boat. The park is open year-round.

==History==
The Thousand Island State Park Commission began purchasing farmland on Wellesley Island in 1951, and opened Wellesley Island State Park in 1954. The park was preceded by two other state parks on Wellesley Island, Dewolf Point and Waterson Point, both of which were established in 1898 as part of the St. Lawrence Reservation.

In 2004, Reserve America named Wellesley Island State Park one of the top 100 campgrounds in the nation.

==Activities and services==
Wellesley Island State Park offers swimming at a life guarded beach, hiking, hunting and fishing, cross-country skiing, biking and recreation programs. The park includes a nature trail, the Minna Anthony Common Nature Center, a marina and three boat launches (power boats permitted), a nine-hole golf course, cabins, camping and a dump station, showers, picnic tables, a playground, and a food concession with attached recreation area. Several of the hiking trails overlook Eel Bay. Archery and muzzle loading are allowed in designated areas.

<doc id="565742" wikidata="Q7661183" url="?curid=565742" title="Symbolic method">
<text>In mathematics, the symbolic method in invariant theory is an algorithm developed by Arthur Cayley, Siegfried Heinrich Aronhold, Alfred Clebsch, and Paul Gordan in the 19th century for computing invariants of algebraic forms. It is based on treating the form as if it were a power of a degree one form, which corresponds to embedding a symmetric power of a vector space into the symmetric elements of a tensor product of copies of it.

==Symbolic notation==
The symbolic method uses a compact, but rather confusing and mysterious notation for invariants, depending on the introduction of new symbols &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, ... (from which the symbolic method gets its name) with apparently contradictory properties.

===Example: the discriminant of a binary quadratic form===
These symbols can be explained by the following example from Gordan. Suppose that 
:formula_1
is a binary quadratic form with an invariant given by the discriminant
:formula_2
The symbolic representation of the discriminant is 
:formula_3
where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the symbols. The meaning of the expression (&quot;ab&quot;)2 is as follows. First of all, (&quot;ab&quot;) is a shorthand form for the determinant of a matrix whose rows are &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2 and &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, so 
:formula_4
Squaring this we get
:formula_5
Next we pretend that
:formula_6
so that
:formula_7
and we ignore the fact that this does not seem to make sense if &quot;f&quot; is not a power of a linear form. 
Substituting these values gives
:formula_8

===Higher degrees===
More generally if 
:formula_9
is a binary form of higher degree, then one introduces new variables &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;c&quot;1, &quot;c&quot;2, with the properties
:formula_10

What this means is that the following two vector spaces are naturally isomorphic:
*The vector space of homogeneous polynomials in &quot;A&quot;0...&quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; of degree &quot;m&quot;
*The vector space of polynomials in 2&quot;m&quot; variables &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;c&quot;1, &quot;c&quot;2, ... that have degree &quot;n&quot; in each of the &quot;m&quot; pairs of variables (&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2), (&quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2), (&quot;c&quot;1, &quot;c&quot;2), ... and are symmetric under permutations of the &quot;m&quot; symbols &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, ...,
The isomorphism is given by mapping &quot;a&#x27;a&quot;, &quot;b&#x27;b&quot;, ... to &quot;A&quot;&quot;j&quot;. This mapping does not preserve products of polynomials.

===More variables===
The extension to a form &quot;f&quot; in more than two variables &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3... is similar: one introduces symbols &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, &quot;a&quot;3 and so on with the properties
:formula_11

==Symmetric products==

The rather mysterious formalism of the symbolic method corresponds to embedding a symmetric product S&quot;n&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) of a vector space &quot;V&quot; into a tensor product of &quot;n&quot; copies of &quot;V&quot;, as the elements preserved by the action of the symmetric group. In fact this is done twice, because the invariants of degree &quot;n&quot; of a quantic of degree &quot;m&quot; are the invariant elements of S&quot;n&quot;S&quot;m&quot;(&quot;V&quot;), which gets embedded into a tensor product of &quot;mn&quot; copies of &quot;V&quot;, as the elements invariant under a wreath product of the two symmetric groups. The brackets of the symbolic method are really invariant linear forms on this tensor product, which give invariants of S&quot;n&quot;S&quot;m&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) by restriction.

<doc id="565743" wikidata="Q33233" url="?curid=565743" title="Economic materialism">
<text>Economic materialism can be described as either a personal attitude that attaches importance to acquiring (and often consuming) material goods, or as a logistical analysis of how physical resources are shaped into consumable products.

The use of the term &quot;materialistic&quot; to describe a person&#x27;s personality or a society tends to have a negative or critical connotation. Also called acquisitiveness, it is often associated with a value system that regards social status as being determined by affluence (see conspicuous consumption), as well as the belief that possessions can provide happiness, which has been critiqued as a lie brought about by capitalism. Environmentalism can be considered a competing orientation to materialism.

The definition of materialism coincides with how and why resources to extract and create the material object are logistically formed. &quot;Success materialism&quot; can be considered a pragmatic form of enlightened self-interest based on a prudent understanding of the character of market-oriented economy and society.

==Definition==
Consumer research typically looks at materialism in two ways: one as a collection of personality traits; and the other as an enduring belief or value.

=== Materialism as a personality trait ===
Russell W. Belk conceptualizes materialism to include three original personality traits:
* &quot;Nongenerosity&quot; – an unwillingness to give or share possessions with others.
* &quot;Envy&quot; – desire for other people&#x27;s possessions.
* &quot;Possessiveness&quot; – concern about loss of possessions and a desire for the greater control of ownership.

=== Materialism as a value ===
Acquisition centrality is when acquiring material possession functions as a central life goal with the belief that possessions are the key to happiness and that success can be judged by a person&#x27;s material wealth and the quality and price of material goods she or he can buy.

==Growing materialism in the Western world==
In the Western world, there is a growing trend of increasing materialism in reaction to discontent. Research conducted in the United States shows that recent generations are focusing more on money, image, and fame than ever before, especially since the generations of Baby Boomers and Generation X.

In one survey of Americans, over 7% said they would seriously consider murdering someone for $3 million and 65% of respondents said they would spend a year on a deserted island to earn $1 million.

A survey conducted by the University of California and the American Council on Education on 250,000 new college students found that their main reason for attending college was to gain material wealth. From the 1970s to the late 1990s, the percentage of students who stated that their main reason for going to college was to develop a meaningful life philosophy dropped from 73% to 44%, while the purpose of obtaining financial gain rose from about 44% to 75%.

==Materialism and happiness==

A series of studies have observed a correlation between materialism and unhappiness. Studies in the United States have found that an increase in material wealth and goods in the country has had little to no effect on the well-being and happiness of its citizens. Tibor Scitovsky called this a &quot;joyless economy&quot; in which people endlessly pursue comforts to the detriments of pleasures.

Using two measures of subjective well-being, one study found that materialism was negatively related to happiness, meaning that people who tended to be more materialistic were also less happy with themselves and their lives. When people derive a lot of pleasure from buying things and believe that acquiring material possessions are important life goals, they tend to have lower life satisfaction scores. Materialism also positively correlates with more serious psychological issues like depression, narcissism and paranoia.

However, the relationship between materialism and happiness is more complex. The direction of the relationship can go both ways. Individual materialism can cause diminished well-being or lower levels of well-being can cause people to be more materialistic in an effort to get external gratification.

In many East Asian cultures, the relationship between materialism, happiness, and well-being are associated with neutral or positive feelings. In China, materialism is often motivated by and through social relations, like families or villages, rather than an individualist pursuit of wealth. This suggests that materialism in interdependent, community-oriented cultures, like in China and Japan, may improve well-being and happiness rather harm them. However, even in independent cultures, people with social motives to acquire wealth may view materialism positively, indicating that the relationship between materialism and happiness is more complex than cultural differences.

Instead, research shows that purchases made with the intention of acquiring life experiences, such as going on a family vacation, make people happier than purchases made to acquire material possessions such as an expensive car. Even just thinking about experiential purchases makes people happier than thinking about material ones. A survey conducted by researchers at the Binghamton University School of Management found differences between what is called “success materialism” and “happiness materialism.” People who see materialism as a source of success tend to be more motivated to work hard and drive to succeed in order to make their lives better as opposed to people who see materialism as a source of happiness. However neither mindset accounts for other factors, such as income or status, that can affect happiness.

<text>Canoe-Picnic Point State Park is a state park located on Grindstone Island in the St. Lawrence River. The park is within the bounds of the Town of Clayton in Jefferson County, New York.

The park is 1 of 80 New York State Parks that are in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with the park experiencing 3 minutes and 20 seconds of totality.

==History==
Canoe-Picnic Point State Park was purchased by the New York State Fisheries, Game and Forest Commission in 1897. Along with Mary Island State Park, it was one of the first New York state parks established along the St. Lawrence River as part of the St. Lawrence Reservation, a recreation area within the Thousand Islands region authorized by New York State in 1896.

Canoe Point is named for the American Canoe Association, who formerly held their annual meetings at the point.

==Park description==
Canoe-Picnic Point State Park is accessible only by boat. The park offers a nature trail, picnic tables and pavilions, cabins, docks, fishing, hiking, and a campground with tent sites. The park&#x27;s recreational facilities are open from late May to early September, although seasonal waterfowl hunting is also permitted within the park.

<text>Rice milk is a plant milk made from rice. Commercial rice milk is typically manufactured using brown rice and brown rice syrup, and may be sweetened using sugar or sugar substitutes, and flavored by common ingredients, such as vanilla. It is commonly fortified with protein and micronutrients, such as vitamin B12, calcium, iron, or vitamin D.

== History ==
The exact origin of rice milk is uncertain. In 1914, Maria M. Gilbert gave a recipe for rice milk in her book &quot;Meatless Cookery&quot;, which was the earliest known use of the term. In 1921, the first rice milk factory was built by the Vita Rice Products Co., launching Vita Rice Milk the same year in San Francisco, California. In 1990, Rice Dream was launched by Imagine Foods of Palo Alto, California in Tetra Pak cartons, becoming the first widely popular rice milk.

==Nutrition==
Rice milk (unsweetened) is 89% water, 9% carbohydrates, 1% fat, and contains negligible protein (table). A 100 ml reference amount provides 47 calories, and – if purposely fortified during manufacturing – 26% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin B12 (table). It also supplies calcium (12% DV; fortified) and manganese (13% DV; fortified) in moderate amounts, but otherwise is low in micronutrients.

== Safety in young children ==
Because of arsenic levels in rice, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Food Standards Agency recommends that rice milk should not be given to children under 5 as a replacement for breast milk, formula milk or cow&#x27;s milk.

==Comparison to dairy milk==
Rice milk contains more carbohydrates when compared to cow&#x27;s milk (9% vs. 5%), but does not contain significant amounts of calcium or protein, and no cholesterol or lactose. Commercial brands of rice milk are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, including calcium, vitamin B12, vitamin B3, and iron. It has a glycemic index of 86 compared to 37 for skim milk and 39 for whole milk.

Rice milk may be consumed by people who are lactose intolerant, allergic to soy or milk. It is also used as a dairy substitute by vegans.

==Commercial brands==
Commercial brands of rice milk are available in various flavors, such as vanilla, as well as unflavored, and can be used in many recipes as an alternative to traditional cow milk.

==Preparation==
Rice milk is made commercially by pressing the rice through a grinding mill, followed by filtration and blending in water. It may be made at home using rice flour and brown rice protein, or by boiling brown rice with a large volume of water, blending and filtering the mixture.

==Environmental concerns==
Rice paddies require substantial water resources, and may enable fertilizers and pesticides to migrate into contiguous waterways. Bacteria inhabiting rice paddies release methane into the atmosphere, emitting this greenhouse gas in quantities greater than other plant milks.

Rice milk production uses less water than dairy milk and almond milk, but considerably more than soy milk or oat milk.

<doc id="565755" wikidata="Q7571465" url="?curid=565755" title="Southwick Beach State Park">
<text>Southwick Beach State Park is a New York State park that lies along an unusual stretch of sandy beach on the eastern shore of Lake Ontario. The park is in size with a length of beach, and is visited annually by about 100,000 people. Immediately to the south is the Lakeview [[New York State Wildlife Management Areas|Wildlife Management Area]] (), which extends the publicly accessible beach by several miles. They are in the Town of Ellisburg in Jefferson County, New York south of the lakeside community of Jefferson Park.

The park offers an extensive campground with tent and trailer sites, picnic facilities, playing fields and a playground. In summer, the swimming area has lifeguards and the park store is open. In winter, snowmobiles are permitted in the park. The park has an accessible nature trail. There are hiking trails from the park that extend into the Lakeview Wildlife Management Area. Lakeview itself has several access points for launching boats, as well as a second nature trail along South Sandy Creek. The hiking trails and boat routes are described at several websites, and in guidebooks by William P. Ehling and by Susan Peterson Gateley.

The park and wildlife management area lie within a rare, freshwater coastal barrier environment that consists of beaches, sand dunes, embayments and marshes. The wildlife management area is also the Lakeview Marsh and Barrier Beach National Natural Landmark, which was cited in 1973 as &quot;One of the best and most extensive marshlands that lie in protected bays and behind barrier beaches along eastern Lake Ontario.&quot; Southwick Beach State Park and Lakeview Wildlife Management Area are included within the New York State Natural Heritage Area entitled &quot;Eastern Lake Ontario Barrier Beach and Wetland Complex&quot;; Lakeview is incorporated in the Eastern Lake Ontario Marshes Bird Conservation Area.

==Beachgrass and the dunes==

The dunes immediately adjacent to the beach support a plant community dominated by beachgrass. The beachgrass grows runners under the surface of the sand that interlock into a ropelike network, and actually builds the dune by trapping sand. Some tall wormwood plants grow amidst the beachgrass, as do cottonwood trees and sand dune willows. Cottonwood is the only dune-forming tree in the area. Sand dune willows are fairly rare in New York State, but are a common woody plant in these dunes. This &quot;beachgrass plant community&quot; stabilizes the dunes against erosion by wind and storm, and enables the growth of a more complex, &quot;poison ivy-dune grape-cottonwood plant community&quot; deeper in the dunes.

Beachgrass growth is disrupted by human and animal traffic. In heavily used regions of the eastern Lake Ontario dunes, foot traffic has eliminated this plant community entirely. Without the beachgrass, the sand dunes are blown away by wind. Starting in the early 1990s, there has been extensive restoration of the beachgrass along eastern Lake Ontario. Wooden &quot;walkovers&quot; have been constructed to manage traffic across the dunes between the beach and interior trails and waterways. The restoration has been accompanied by education and outreach programs intended to reduce traffic across the dunes. The improvement in beachgrass growth has been documented by a &quot;photomonitoring project&quot; from 1995-2005.

Until the 20th Century, the beachgrass in this region would have been the type now known as &quot;Champlain beachgrass&quot;, which is found only along eastern Lake Ontario and along Lake Champlain. It is very similar to the common American beachgrass native to the Atlantic coasts of North America, but blooms in July instead of September. &quot;Cape variety&quot; American beachgrass was introduced into the area, and is now mixed with Champlain.

==Boogie, baseball, and beaches: the Southwick history==
Southwick Beach State Park was named after the Southwick family, who owned the property for nearly a century (1870 to 1960); the park is referred to as &quot;Southwick&#x27;s Beach State Park&quot; on some maps. Starting in the 1920s, several promoters built entertainment facilities on the property. The most notable was Albert Ellis, who leased the beach from the Southwick family for about 15 years, and developed it as the &quot;Coney Island&quot; of Northern New York. In time, the beach boasted a roller coaster, bathhouses, a dance pavilion, merry go-round, and midway. Ellis also organized the Jefferson County Amateur Baseball League. A baseball diamond was built at Southwick Beach, and for several years there was a Southwick Beach team. These businesses failed during the Great Depression (1929–1941).

By the 1950s, the value of the eastern Lake Ontario shoreline for recreation and conservation was becoming clear, although little of this land was publicly owned. In 1960, the Leesi Management Corporation of Syracuse purchased the beach property from the Southwick family and operated the beach as a recreational facility for five years. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation purchased the property in 1965 for $150,000; Southwick Beach State Park opened in May, 1966.

==Lagoons and sand: geology of eastern Lake Ontario==

The sandy beaches at the Park are part of a length of sandy shore between Sandy Pond to the south and Black Pond to the north. Another comparable stretch of sandy beach on Lake Ontario is at Sandbanks Provincial Park in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada, which is along the northeastern shore of the lake. These are the main areas with sandy beaches on Lake Ontario.

Bradford B. van Diver has described the eastern Lake Ontario dunes as &quot;similar in many details to the south shore of Long Island, with drowned river mouths forming lagoons behind a smooth curving line of barrier bars.&quot; The lagoons to which van Diver refers are the notable ponds of this region, including (from north to south) Black, Lakeview, North Sandy, and South Sandy. Both the rivers themselves, and their mouths, are no longer evident. Shortly after the cessation of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago, the water level of Lake Ontario was much lower than it is today; one needs to envision large rivers flowing into a lake some tens of meters lower than today&#x27;s level. The river mouths were then &quot;drowned&quot; by the rise of the water level of Lake Ontario above this low point. Similarly, sand itself is no longer being formed in abundance; the sand present on today&#x27;s beaches was probably formed long ago, and transported down from higher elevations during the post-glacial period of low water levels in the lake.

<doc id="565758" wikidata="Q137800" url="?curid=565758" title="The Yards">
<text>The Yards is a 2000 American crime film directed by James Gray, written by Gray and Matt Reeves, and starring Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron, Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn and James Caan.

Set in the commuter rail yards in New York City (&quot;the yards&quot;), specifically in the boroughs of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn, where contractors repair railway cars for the city Transit Authority (TA), bribery, corporate crime and political corruption are commonplace, as rival companies sabotage each other&#x27;s work to win bids, and the undercutting leads to murder.

==Plot==
Leo Handler visits his mother Val&#x27;s house in Queens, New York, where she throws a surprise party celebrating his parole. There he meets up with Willie Gutierrez, his cousin Erica Soltz&#x27;s boyfriend, who thanks him for serving time in prison, implying that Leo had taken a fall for their gang of friends. Eager to support Val, who has a heart condition, Leo follows Willie&#x27;s suggestion of working for Erica&#x27;s stepfather, Frank Olchin. The next day, at the offices of his railway car repair company, the Electric Rail Corporation, in Maspeth, Frank offers to help finance Leo&#x27;s studies during a 2-year machinist program. Needing work immediately, Leo asks if Willie could be allowed to join the company, but Frank declines. Willie commiserates with Leo that night at a nightclub, saying Frank also unsuccessfully tried to get him into a machinist program.

At Brooklyn Borough Hall, Willie explains the inherent corruption in the contract system for repair work on the subways. After a hearing to award contracts, Hector Gallardo, co-owner of the Puerto Rican-owned Weltech Corporation, a minority company, approaches Willie about leaving Frank&#x27;s firm for his. Willie declines and instead brings Leo with him to Roosevelt Island, where he bribes an official charged with awarding contracts. One night, Willie brings Leo to the Sunnyside repair yards, where he and his crew sabotage Weltech&#x27;s work, hoping to lower their quality rating and lessen their ability to get contracts. Leo is instructed to stand watch while the crew sabotages the train couplings. Willie enters yard master Elliot Gorwitz&#x27;s office to pay him off with Knicks tickets, but is ordered to remove his crew from the tracks, as Gallardo has already brought him $2,000 in cash. Gorwitz activates the alarm, which draws police officer Jerry Rifkin to the scene. Terrified of potentially returning to prison, Leo attempts escape, but when Rifkin starts assaulting him with his night stick, Leo beats him into unconsciousness. As he escapes, he witnesses Willie fatally stabbing Gorwitz.

With Rifkin in a coma at a hospital, the crew orders Leo to murder him to prevent him from identifying Leo when he awakens and escape certain death. Upon awakening, Rifkin identifies Leo as his attacker, triggering a broad manhunt. The police, assuming Leo also killed Gorwitz, raid Val&#x27;s apartment, causing her to suffer from a near-fatal heart attack. Despite being instructed by Willie to keep a low profile, Leo emerges from hiding to visit a sick Val. While he is tending to her, Erica discovers Willie was with Leo at the yards and realizes he was the one who murdered Gorwitz, consequently ending her romantic relationship with him. Frank disowns Willie, who tries unsuccessfully to accept a deal offered to him earlier by Gallardo for protection.

Erica implores Frank to help, but instead Leo realizes that Frank is prepared to kill him. With no other options available, Leo desperately turns to Gallardo for protection. Accompanied by Gallardo&#x27;s lawyers, Leo turns himself in at a public hearing into the rail yard incident and contract corruption. Realizing that Rifkin&#x27;s testimony against Leo is in no one&#x27;s interest, Frank and Gallardo negotiate a new split of the contracts with Queens Borough President Arthur Mydanick in a backroom deal. Willie visits Erica, wanting to reconcile with her, and disturbingly reveals to her that according to Frank, she and Leo had been in a romantic relationship when they were younger, and once were caught having sexual intercourse. Fearing his temper and jealousy, Erica triggers the silent house alarm. Willie frantically attempts to embrace her to avoid being exposed as unsuitable, but as she pulls away from him, he unintentionally throws Erica off the second floor landing to her death. Outside the house, he surrenders to the police, who have immediately responded to the alarm.

Police arrive at the hearing to inform Erica&#x27;s mother Kitty and Frank of Erica&#x27;s death. After Erica&#x27;s funeral, Frank pulls Leo aside to promise help in the future, if he abstains from testifying at a hearing by the Attorney General, but Leo disgustedly rejects his offer. He ultimately testifies against Frank, Arthur, Willie, and the others involved in the political corruption surrounding The Yards, before departing from Queens on the elevated train.

==Cast==

In addition, actual New York City-based news anchors Roma Torre, Lewis Dodley (as Louis Dodley) and Ernie Anastos play news anchors seen reporting on incidents in the film.

==Production==
The film&#x27;s director and co-screenwriter, James Gray, based the film on an actual corruption scandal in the mid-1980s, which involved his father. It was initially written for Fox Searchlight but Miramax took over production in 1996.

The New York City Transit Authority, known as the MTA, initially disallowed the production companies from filming at any of its yards because it believed the film negatively portrayed the agency.

Filming locations included Roosevelt Island, Maspeth and Elmhurst, Queens, the Bronx, and New Jersey. The railyard scenes were shot at the MTA&#x27;s Inwood, Manhattan, 207th Street Yard and shop, as well as an abandoned freight yard in Brooklyn.

It was shot in the spring and summer of 1998 butdue to studio delaysnot released until the fall of 2000.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64%, based on 96 reviews, with an average rating of 5.93/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Featuring strong performances and direction, &quot;The Yards&quot; is a richly textured crime thriller with an authentic feel.&quot;

===Box office===
On a relatively limited release, the film, which had a $24 million budget, took in just $889,352 in the United States and Canada, and $34,684 in Australia.

<doc id="565794" wikidata="Q5099396" url="?curid=565794" title="Chimney Bluffs State Park">
<text>Chimney Bluffs State Park is a state park in the town of Huron in Wayne County, New York. The park is situated on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, east of Sodus Bay. From the park&#x27;s hiking trails, visitors can view the large clay formations at the water&#x27;s edge for which the park is named.

==Geology==

The bluffs are formed from eroded drumlins, teardrop-shaped hills of glacial till that were deposited and shaped by glaciers during the most recent ice age. The erosive power of wind, rain, snow, and waves has formed the landscape into sharp pinnacles. Although the pinnacles and cliffs, some of which rise up to above the lake shore, have existed for thousands of years, they are constantly changing and further eroding.

==Park history and features==

The Chimney Bluffs area has been a landmark for many years. According to the pamphlet given by the park, smugglers used the area as a landing point while transporting liquor from Canada during Prohibition. The area was acquired by the state of New York in 1963 after having previously been operated informally as a privately owned recreation area.

It lay undeveloped until 1999 when a parking lot, service building with heated restrooms, picnic areas with grills, and hiking trails throughout the park were added. It is considered a year-round park for hiking and picnicking in the summer. Swimming is prohibited. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing; a trailhead for snowmobiling is also located within the park.
The park has approximately of hiking trails, including a trail along the Bluffs between the west and east entrances.

From some vantage points in the park, visitors can see Nine Mile Point Nuclear Generating Station, to the northeast, as well as the coal smokestacks located in Oswego. On sufficiently clear days, the Rochester skyline may also be visible on the horizon about 36 miles (58 km) to the southwest.

<text>The Georgia national rugby union team, nicknamed The Lelos, is administered by the Georgian Rugby Union. The team takes part in the annual Rugby Europe Championship, and the Rugby World Cup which takes place every four years and in which it has appeared continuously since 2003.

Georgia is currently considered one of the strongest second-tier rugby union nations. It is one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing rugby nations. The Lelos participate in the Rugby Europe Championship, winning the tournament in 2001 and every year since 2006–08, with the exception of 2017. The bulk of the national squad are based in France, in both the Top 14 and lower divisions. This is a practice that was popularised by the former national team coach, Claude Saurel, a Frenchman.
Rugby is one of the most popular sports in Georgia, with many similarities to the ancient Georgian folk-sport of Lelo burti, from which the national team derives its nickname. The national team qualified for the Rugby World Cup six times, first in 2003 – playing against rugby powers such as England and South Africa. The Lelos won their first ever World Cup match in 2007, when they beat Namibia 30–0. Since 2013, Georgia has hosted the World Rugby Tbilisi Cup.

==History==
===Soviet era===
There were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce a rugby union into Georgia, the earliest known being in 1928, with subsequent attempts also in 1940 and in 1948. Rugby was introduced to Georgia by Jacques Haspekian, an Armenian man from Marseille in France who taught the game to students in the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, although he then subsequently returned in France. He is still alive and living in Marseilles, he was interviewed on French radio on the occasion of Georgia playing France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The first rugby session was held on 15 October 1959 in Tbilisi, at the racecourse, where 20 people attended the meeting. The first Georgian club formed was the GPI (Georgian Polytechnical Institute), now known as &quot;Qochebi&quot;.

Rugby&#x27;s popularity in Georgia might be explained by its resemblance to the traditional Georgian game named &quot;Lelo&quot; or &quot;Lelo Burti&quot; (meaning &quot;Field Ball&quot;). This game was played in Georgia from ancient times and is still played on occasions in rural areas. A field (&quot;Lelo&quot;) was selected between two river creeks which represented a playing ground. Two teams, usually consisting of the male population of neighboring villages, would face each other. The number of players from each side was not set, but included any able men each village could summon. A large, heavy ball was placed in the middle of the field and the goal of the game was to carry it over the river creek of the opposing side.

The first teams appeared in 1959. The Georgia Rugby Union was founded in 1964, but until the late 1980s it was part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s rugby federation. The rugby union connection between France and Georgia started as links were established by the then powerful French Communist Party and many other left-wing organisations. Georgia initially did not have its own team and its best players would play for the USSR team.

In 1988 Georgia produced their first national sevens side, while still a Soviet republic. In September 1989, Georgia got together with other FIRA countries to host a tour by Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe&#x27;s first match on the tour was in the wet against Georgia in Kutaisi, west of Tbilisi, which Georgia won 16–3. The next year Georgia went to Zimbabwe where they played two tests, losing the first in Bulawayo and winning the second 26–10 in Harare.

===1990s===
On 9 April 1991 Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union. Georgia was now a rugby union nation but getting matches was not easy: Commonwealth of Independent States, which Georgia did not join, was the successor team of the Soviet Union and played matches in 1992. Georgia were limited to the odd game against Ukraine until they gained membership of the World Rugby in 1992.

French coach, Claude Saurel, first arrived in Georgia in 1997 with a brief to assess the standard of sport; he and his development team have helped boost the profile of the sport. Saurel went on to work with the Georgia national rugby sevens team, until he was appointed as the national coach in the summer of 1999.

Georgia&#x27;s 1998 loss to Romania saw them play a two legged repechage play-off against Tonga to qualify for the 1999 World Cup. On that occasion Georgia lost the first leg 37–6 in Nukualofa before a 28–27 win in Tbilisi. This was not enough and Georgia failed to qualify.

===2000s: World Cup play===
After France and Italy dropped from the reborn European Nations Cup, Georgia became a major force in the tournament. In 2000, Georgia finished second in the competition, finishing behind Romania.
Rugby union took off in the country, the travel and opportunities to land lucrative contracts in France made rugby union a glamorous pursuit in Georgia. Georgia placed second in the 2001–02 tournament. When Georgia played Russia in the European Nations Cup 65,000 people crammed into the national stadium in Tbilisi.

Georgian first made an impact at Rugby Sevens by finishing a respectable 10th in the 2001 edition of the Rugby World Cup Sevens in Argentina.

In October 2002 Georgia faced Russia, in what was at the time one of the most important clashes ever between the two national sides. The victorious nation would head to the 2003 Rugby World Cup, and the loser would be relegated to fight it out for a repechage position. Neither nation had ever been to a World Cup, though Georgia had come close in 1999. 50,000 spectators turned out to the national stadium. Both nations kicked penalty goals in the first half, but Russia moved ahead with a 13–9 lead through a try, but Georgia were able to score a try of their own just before half time, with Levan Tsabadze putting them in front 14–13 at the break. Georgia held on, winning 17–13, a victory which sparked celebrations throughout the capital. Three of the 75 French-based Georgian players were denied permission to play in the tournament and were suspended. Another five were sacked and arrived in Australia as free agents. In a warm-up game held in Asti the Georgians lost to Italians 31–22.

In the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Georgia were grouped into pool C alongside giants – South Africa and England. They suffered their heaviest ever defeat when beaten by England 84–6 in their opening game. In their second match, Samoa comfortably eased to a 46–9 victory. Although they performed well against the Springboks (losing 46–19) they were disappointingly defeated by Uruguay 24–12, in a match that they were expected to win. They lost all four of their matches but had impressed against South Africa. Despite the sad financial state of their union, qualification has seen the sport&#x27;s profile rise throughout Georgia.
In the 2007 Rugby World Cup Georgia were drawn against Argentina, Ireland, Namibia and tournament hosts France in Pool D.
The team recorded their first win in the rugby world cup with a 30–0 win over Namibia in their Pool D match at Stade Felix-Bollaert. The foundation for the victory was laid by Georgia&#x27;s experienced forward pack who wore down their opponents at the breakdown. The 2007 world cup campaign is also well remembered for Georgians by a brilliant display against Ireland, where Georgia narrowly lost the match 10–14. The tournament was over with 7–64 defeat to hosts France on 30 September.

===2010–2019===

At 2011 Rugby World Cup, Georgia&#x27;s Pool B included England, Argentina and Scotland, as well as local rivals Romania. Despite the close nature of their pool, Georgia were impressive in all matches, including a tight match against Scotland which was lost 15–6, thus missing a bonus point narrowly and a 41–10 loss against England, which featured a man-of-the-match performance by flanker Mamuka Gorgodze. Georgia went on to record only their second ever Rugby World Cup win against Romania, winning 25–9 with another man-of-the-match performance by Mamuka Gorgodze. Georgia finished their campaign with a strong showing against Argentina, leading 7–5 at half time before conceding 20 unanswered points to lose 25–7. Thus Georgia finished their campaign with 1 win and 3 losses.

In the 2015 Rugby World Cup Georgia played against Tonga, Argentina, title holders New Zealand and the top African qualifier Namibia in Pool C.
The group opener finished with Georgia&#x27;s 17–10 victory against Tonga. their third win in a World Cup match.
Georgia lost their second match against Argentina 9–54, after trailing 14–9 at half-time. In the third match Georgia were defeated by New Zealand 43–10 in Cardiff. Again in the first half The Lelos held very well against the All Blacks, trailing the world champions 22–10. 
In the last match Georgia defeated Namibia 17–16 to finish third, their highest in a world cup, and securing their qualification for 2019 Rugby World Cup at the same time.
In 2016, Georgia once again cemented its claim to be the seventh best national rugby team in Europe, when they won the European Nations Cup for the sixth consecutive time, with 10 wins from 10 matches. In the 2016 mid-year internationals the Lelos traveled to the Pacific islands for the first time and finished the historic tour unbeaten with 19–19 draw against Samoa, 23–20 victory against Tonga and 14–3 victory against Fiji.

===2019 World Cup===
Georgia is approaching the 2019 World Cup with confidence, it has just won three of the four European Nations Championship and has a squad that combines youth (Abzhandadze, Kveseladze) and experience (Mamukashvili, Chilachava, Bregvadze). The Georgian federation aims to reproduce the same performance as in 2015 by finishing third in the group. However, Georgia inherits a strong field made up of Australia, Wales, Fiji and Uruguay. On 23 September, the Lelos began the competition by facing Wales with a 43–14 for the British. Six days later, Uruguay faced the Georgians, four days after the South Americans created the feat by beating the Fijians 30–27. Final score for the Lelos 33–7. Georgia then meets Fiji, their rival for third place which means automatic qualification for 2023 in a 10–45 match for the islanders where we will see 3/4 Georgians. Georgia ended up with an honorable 27–8 defeat against the already qualified Australians. The results are disappointing for the Georgians. The team finished fourth behind Fiji and will have to go through the qualification box for 2023. During this Cup, Georgia showed progress but still lacks organization from an offensive point of view, individual and collective quality for three quarters. and often breaks down during the hour of play on a physical level.

===2020–2023===
For this post-World Cup year, Georgia faces two significant changes. Milton Haig, who left after a positive record, has been replaced by his deputy Levan Maisashvili. Additionally, the squad must undergo a renewal process following the retirement of key players such as Mamukashvili, Begadze, and Malaguradze.

On 1 February, Georgia clashed with their Romanian rivals in the 2020 European Nations Championship, concluding with a 41–13 victory for the Lelos. Subsequent matches included a 10–23 loss to the Spaniards, a dominant 78–6 victory against the Belgians, and a close 24–39 battle against Portugal. Despite their promising performance, the Lelos&#x27; journey in the competition was abruptly halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October, the Georgian federation received an invitation to participate in the Autumn Nations Cup, which brought together the six teams from the Six Nations Tournament, Fiji, and Georgia. Placed in a pool with England, Ireland, and Wales, the Georgians finished last in the competition after conceding a classification match against Fiji.
In July 2022, Georgia beat a Tier 1 nation for the first time, Italy, 28–19.
In November 2022, Georgia beat Wales 13–12 in Cardiff.
During the European Rugby Championship 2023, Georgia again dominated its opponents and clinched the 15th title.

===2023 World Cup===
During the 2023 Rugby World Cup Georgia dramatically underperformed to what was expected. Playing in a pool lacking one of the four tournament favourites, but notable for strength in depth, Georgia aiming to cause an upset against one of the three tier one sides and guarantee automatic qualification for 2027, but last in their pool having not won a game, despite some relatively strong showings.

They got off to a rocky start with a 35–15 loss to Australia on 9 September; though not expected to win they were thought they might put up a better fight. Next, more concerningly, on 23 September they drew with the only other Tier two team in the pool, Portugal by a score of 18–18 in a match they were expected to win; 7 days later they put up a strong fight against Fiji but were eventually defeated 17–12 before finishing on 7 October getting well beaten by Wales 43–19. A shock victory for Portugal against Fiji condemned Georgia to fifth place in the pool, although the extension of the 2027 World Cup to 24 teams announced shortly afterwards relieved some of the concerns for future qualification. Georgia returned to form, however, in the following Rugby Europe Internationally championship, once more winning the second tier competition convincingly.

===2024–Present===
Traditionally, Georgia started 2024 with won 2024 Rugby Europe Championship.

After a win to Netherlands in the 2025 Rugby Europe Championship, Georgia qualified for the 2027 Men&#x27;s Rugby World Cup.

==Lelo==

Lelo or lelo burti (), literally a &quot;field ball [playing]&quot;, is a Georgian folk sport, which is a full contact ball game, and very similar to rugby, itself a public school codification of older folk football games. Within Georgian rugby union terminology, the word &quot;lelo&quot; is used to mean a try, and the popularity of rugby union in Georgia has also been attributed to it. In 2014, lelo burti, along with khridoli, a traditional martial art, was inscribed by the government of Georgia as a &quot;nonmaterial monument&quot; of culture.

It appears in the 12th century Georgian epic poem &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; in which the characters play lelo burti.

===Notable former players===

Mamuka Gorgodze – Switched to rugby from basketball aged 17. His first club was Lelo in the Georgian Top League, he was soon selected for the Georgia national team and made his debut in 2003 against Spain, at the age of just 18 and not long after he started playing rugby. However he was not selected for Georgia&#x27;s first appearance at the 2003 Rugby World Cup later that year. In 2004 he became a regular fixture for the Georgia side. He was a regular in the Georgia side though and was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and started three of Georgia&#x27;s four matches at the World Cup, being one of Georgia&#x27;s star players. Gorgodze became a success as flanker during this season, and halfway through the season French newspaper L&#x27;Équipe commented that he improved his technique and became a mobile and unstoppable player. Gorgodze played a big role in Montpellier finishing the 2010–11 Top 14 season as runners up. At the end of the season L&#x27;Équipe named him as the best foreigner in the league. He was selected for the Georgia squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup and played all the Georgia matches, being named man of the match in two matches, against England and Romania.
Davit Zirakashvili – originally came from a wrestling background, but switched to rugby in 2000. He moved to France in 2002 to play with Fédérale 1 side Aubenas. He moved up the leagues to the Top 14 in the 2004/05 season to play with Clermont where he joined his Georgian compatriot Goderdzi Shvelidze. He also made his debut for Georgia in 2004 against Uruguay. He soon became an important member of both the Clermont and Georgia side. He played in all four of the consecutive Top 14 finals Clermont reached between 2007 and 2010, he scored a try in the 2008 Top 14 final against Toulouse and in 2010 became the first Georgian player to win the Top 14, and represented Georgia in both the 2007, 2011 and 2015 World Cups. In 2010, Zirakashvili was voted Georgian sportsman of the year after some crucial performances for both club and country. He was part of a Georgian scrum which scored three penalty tries and also a pushover try in the calendar year, he also a memorable solo try from 45 metres out against Russia in Trabzon and an important try against Canada. His scrummaging was a key factor in Georgia recording wins against both Canada and USA for the first time, whilst at club level he was part of Clermont&#x27;s Top 14 winning side. Zirakashvili was also mentioned as one of the best tighthead props of the year in world rugby by The Daily Telegraph.
Ilia Zedginidze – Played as a Number 8 and was a lineout specialist. A member of their inaugural World Cup side in 2003, he captained Georgia in the 2007 tournament, but was forced out of the squad because of an injury. This injury ultimately led to him announcing his retirement from international rugby, after gaining 48 caps. He returned to the squad in late 2008, playing against Scotland A and taking part in the 2009 European Nations Cup, where he scored a game-saving try against Portugal on 14 February 2009.

Malkhaz Urjukashvili – Moved to France, where he has been playing. He is one of the best players and scorers for Georgia, holding currently 65 caps for his National Team, with 18 tries and 300 points. His first match was a 29–15 win over Croatia, in Tbilisi, at 12 October 1997, aged only 17 years old. This made him one of the youngest players ever to be capped at international rugby level. He was present at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, playing three matches and scoring 9 points. In the game against England, he kicked a long range penalty that registered as Georgia&#x27;s first Rugby World Cup points (England eventually won the game 84–6). He was called once again for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, playing in all the four matches and scoring one conversion. He continued to be a valuable player in the 2011 Rugby World Cup qualification, the third Georgia gained in a row.

<text>Long Point State Park (in the Finger Lakes) is a state park located on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. The park is in the Town of Ledyard in Cayuga County, New York.

==Park description==
The park offers a playground, picnic tables, hunting, fishing, hiking and a boat launch. A cottage is available for rent along the lake&#x27;s shore. There is a $7 fee to park a car or launch a boat.

===Long Point State Park trail system===
In the Fall of 2013, community volunteers, with the approval of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, developed a new trail system on the east side of New York Route 90, which divides the formerly undeveloped inland section of the park from the waterfront section. The new trail system features secluded picnic tables and hilltop views of Cayuga Lake. A section of the trail system runs along the top of a small gorge.

<doc id="565830" wikidata="Q5030569" url="?curid=565830" title="Canadian Soccer League championship final">
<text>The Canadian Soccer League championship final or CSL Championship is the post-season match of the Canadian Soccer League (CSL) and is the successor to the CNSL Championship. The winner is crowned champion in the same manner as in other North American sports leagues (i.e. via a playoff following a regular season). This differs from other top soccer leagues around the world which consider the club with the most points at the end of the season to be the sole champion. It is a Non-FIFA championship match that was previously sanctioned by the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) but is now affiliated with the Soccer Federation of Canada (SFC).

The league hosted its inaugural championship, on October 14, 1998. The CSL Championship is traditionally held in early October. Toronto Croatia is the most successful team, winning a record sixth cup in 2015.

Throughout its history, the championship has had several title sponsors from the &quot;Primus Cup&quot; in 2000, the &quot;Rogers Cup&quot; from 2001 to 2009, and the &quot;Givova Cup&quot; from 2010 onwards.

== History ==
In the initial years, the championship finals were dominated by Toronto Olympians, and Ottawa Wizards, who had financial support from corporations such as Coffee Time, and Oz Optics Ltd. St. Catharines Wolves, and Toronto Croatia two well-established former Canadian National Soccer League (CNSL) clubs were the prominent challengers in the early years. The inaugural championship was contested between the 1997 CNSL champions St. Catharines and Toronto Olympians with the Wolves securing the title in a penalty shootout. St. Catharines would conclude their golden decade in 2001 with their second championship acquired against Toronto Supra. While the Olympians appeared in the first three CPSL Championship finals, but only managed one victory in 1999 against Toronto Croatia. The Croatians would avenge their defeat the following season after defeating the Olympians 2–0.

In 2000, the championship received its first title sponsorship from Primus and witnessed the emergence of the Ottawa Wizards after the league&#x27;s major expansion run in 2001. The heavily invested Wizards would dominate the next three seasons with an eventual championship in 2002. After a series of disputes with the CPSL board of directors, Ottawa withdrew from the playoff competition after securing an undefeated regular season in 2003. As a result, this created an opportunity for various clubs to contend for the championship with the Brampton Hitmen claiming the title. After the decline and departure of the Olympians, Wizards, and Wolves a shift occurred with Croatia and York Region Shooters (then as the Vaughan Shooters, later as Italia Shooters) achieving a powerhouse status as both champions and top contenders with the Serbian White Eagles as the prominent challengers. The re-emergence of the White Eagles re-sparked the traditional rivalry between Croatia and Serbia, which caused the 2007 championship final to be divided into two matches to segregate the fans.

Toronto Croatia currently holds the record amount of six championships and holds the distinction of being the first club to successfully defend the title in two consecutive seasons from 2014 till 2015. As the league expanded beyond the Greater Toronto Area and Ontario border a television agreement was reached with Rogers TV, which granted the company naming rights to the championship. In 2010, Givova became the title sponsor for the league and championship. Meanwhile, another milestone was achieved by Trois-Rivières Attak the farm team to the Montreal Impact as it became the first Quebec club to capture the championship in 2009 after defeating Serbia in a 3-2 penalty shootout. Other single champions have included the likes of the Oakville Blue Devils, Brantford Galaxy, and SC Waterloo Region. In 2014, York Region became the second club in the league&#x27;s history to produce a perfect season followed by the Toronto Olympians since the 1999 season.

==Format==
After the regular season, the top eight finishers qualify for the play-offs. Those then consist of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the championship final. Except for the 2007 final, which was contested over two legs, the final is played like one match only.

==Champions== 
The winner of the Canadian Soccer League&#x27;s CSL Championship determines the season&#x27;s league champion. The playoff tournament is organized by the league after the regular season in a format similar to other North American professional sports leagues.

The first CSL Championship final was played on October 14, 1998. As of 2017, the record for the most championships is held by Toronto Croatia with six cup titles. The record for the most championships lost is held by Scarborough SC, who lost the game four times during their history.

<doc id="565854" wikidata="Q1811890" url="?curid=565854" title="Open Canada Cup">
<text>The Open Canada Cup was an annual knock-out cup competition in Canadian Soccer. The competition was first held during the 1998 season as the CPSL League Cup. It was organized by the Canadian Soccer League (formerly the Canadian Professional Soccer League) originally as a League Cup for CSL member clubs. After operating the competition for several seasons as an exclusive tournament, the league&#x27;s ownership decided in 2003 to grant accessibility to all Canadian professional and amateur clubs. The decision was influenced by the lack of initiative by the Canadian Soccer Association in providing a potential candidate for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup.

Further reforms consisted of title sponsorship with the Government of Canada and the inclusion of a financial reward for the overall champion. Subsequently, the tournament managed to attract several notable amateurs, and professional clubs with credentials from the USL First Division, Canadian National Challenge Cup, Ligue de Soccer Elite Quebec, and the Ontario Cup. In 2007, the competition reached its zenith as it expanded westward to include clubs from British Columbia with the inclusion of the champion of the British Columbia Provincial Soccer Championship. In 2008, the prize money was increased, but after the creation of the Canadian Championship, the competition was disbanded. Since the establishment of the Canadian Championship, CSL teams have not participated in the tournament which determines the Canadian entry into the CONCACAF Champions League.

Canadian Soccer League teams dominated the competition throughout its history; the only non-CSL champion was Ottawa St. Anthony Italia in the 2006. Toronto Olympians were the most successful club, winning three titles. David Gee is the most successful head coach in the history of the competition, having won three titles as head coach of Toronto Olympians.

== Competition format ==
Originally, the format of the competition was organized into a group stage with the two top teams advancing to the semifinals and a final match to decide the champion in September. The arrangement of teams for the group stages was determined by the geographical locations of the clubs to accommodate the travel distances. In 2002, the format was revised with the introduction of a qualifying round with a home and away two-game series followed by a quarterfinal, semifinal, and championship final round. While the hosting club was granted a wildcard privilege. When the tournament transitioned into an open cup competition, the first round consisted of amateur league clubs. CSL and later USL clubs entered play into the second round.

When the competition expanded westward, British Columbia teams held separate qualifying matches through the British Columbia Provincial Soccer Championship where the champion received a bye into the semifinals. Traditionally, the schedule of the tournament revolved around the summer holiday long weekends. The opening round was played around Victoria Day the second round during Canada Day, the quarterfinals on the Civic Holiday weekend, and the tournament would conclude during the Labour Day long weekend. The matches were generally decided on a one-legged tie that lasted 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time. Drawn matches went directly to extra time, and if necessary, they went to a penalty shootout.

== History ==
Historically, attempts at organizing a national open cup competition between professional and amateur clubs in Canadian soccer was a concept largely ignored by the national and provincial associations. One such exception is the Challenge Trophy, which continuously operates at a national level but solely for amateur clubs. A tournament was formed by the CSL&#x27;s predecessor league the National Soccer League (NSL) in the 1986 season known as the NSL Canada Cup which crowned a national league cup champion with the Pacific Rim Soccer League of British Columbia, and the Quebec National Soccer League as participants. The NSL also promoted the NSL Canadian Championship to provide a national champion and a Canadian representative to the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. Proposals were suggested in 1996 by the USL A-League by presenting a trophy to its Canadian franchises to establish a Canadian open cup competition, but the idea failed to materialize.


In 1998, the Canadian National Soccer League and the Ontario Soccer Association collaborated to form the Canadian Professional Soccer League (CPSL) an attempt to form a national league. Initially, the CPSL ran a league cup known as the CPSL League Cup but was restricted to member clubs. Shortly after the tournament attracted sponsorship deals from Primus Canada, and in 2001 received a title sponsor from Oz Optics Ltd. In the initial years, the league cup was dominated by the Toronto Olympians, which later was assumed by the heavily invested Ottawa Wizards.

In 2002, the competition received financial aid from the Canadian government in the form of a federal grant with intentions to promote the tournament across the country. As a result, the league began to take the initiative of providing a potential candidate for the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup as the Canadian Soccer Association and other provincial governing bodies neglected in organizing an open cup tournament. The previous time a Canadian club competed in the Champions&#x27; Cup was in the 1976 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup represented by Toronto Italia of the National Soccer League. In 2003, the CPSL opened their league cup to all Canadian professional and amateur clubs with the intent of providing the potential Canadian candidate to the continental tournament. The competition was renamed the Open Canada Cup with the government of Canada as the initial title sponsor, and the inclusion of a $10,000 reward for the champion.

As the restrictions on eligibility were lifted for the 2003 Open Canada Cup the tournament managed to entice clubs from the Ontario Soccer League, Ottawa Carleton Soccer League, Western Ontario Soccer League, and the Ligue de Soccer Elite Quebec to participate. The competition was won by London City in a penalty shootout against the Metro Lions played at Cove Road Stadium, London, Ontario. Despite the CPSL&#x27;s successful attempt at organizing an open cup tournament, the competition was not without controversy. The controversy stemmed from a dispute involving Ottawa Wizards with the CPSL&#x27;s board of directors over the hosting rights for the finals. After failing to confirm their participation in the later rounds of the tournament the league removed Ottawa from the competition, and in return, Ottawa threatened to obtain an injunction. The dispute eventually reached the Superior Court of Justice which ruled in favor of the CPSL decision and allowed the tournament to proceed without the participation of Ottawa.

The tournament continued to expand, and in 2004 attracted a record amount of 24 participants throughout Ontario. It would grow to include clubs with Challenge Cup, and Ontario Cup honors. Meanwhile, the on-field performance was dominated by the Windsor Border Stars with consecutive championships from 2004 to 2005. In 2006, the competition reached a new milestone as it managed to draw the attention of the Toronto Lynx of the USL First Division, the country&#x27;s top-tier league. The 2006 edition made headlines as Ottawa St. Anthony Italia became the first amateur club to claim the championship after defeating the Toronto Lynx in the finals. The tournament reached its apex in 2007 as it broaden to include professional and amateur teams from British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. Trois-Rivières Attak became the first Quebec champion in 2007 after defeating Columbus Clan F.C.

In 2008, the CSL increased the prize money to $25,000 with the top amateur club receiving $10,000, but shortly after the creation of the Canadian Championship the competition was disbanded.

<text>Martyn John Evans (born 27 November 1953 in Birmingham, England), is a former South Australian independent and Australian Labor Party state and federal politician.

Evans was educated at The University of Adelaide, and was a state government administrative officer before entering politics. Evans was a member of the City of Elizabeth council from 1975 to 1984 and served as mayor from 1981 to 1984.

Evans entered the South Australian House of Assembly following the 1984 Elizabeth by-election, caused when Peter Duncan resigned from the seat to contest the federal seat of Makin. Elected as a Labor independent, he served as Minister of Health, Family and Community Services and Minister for the Aged from 1992 to 1993, and rejoined Labor from 1993.

Evans moved from state to federal politics in 1994. He was Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1994 to October 2004, representing the Division of Bonython, South Australia. A 1994 Elizabeth by-election was sparked when Evans resigned to contest the 1994 Bonython by-election. Evans was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1996 to 2001.

The Division of Bonython was abolished at the 2003 electoral redistribution. Evans contested the Division of Wakefield at the 2004 election, which had absorbed most of Bonython&#x27;s former territory and had become notionally Labor as a result. However, he was narrowly defeated by less than one percent.

Evans took up the position of director of community engagement at The University of Adelaide in July 2007.

<text>The Lower Depths (, literally: &quot;At the bottom&quot;) is a play by Russian dramatist Maxim Gorky written in 1902 and produced by the Moscow Arts Theatre on December 18, 1902, under the direction of Konstantin Stanislavski. It became his first major success, and a hallmark of Russian social realism. The play depicts a group of impoverished Russians living in a shelter near the Volga.

When it first appeared, &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; was criticized for its pessimism and ambiguous ethical message. The presentation of the lower classes was viewed as overly dark and unredemptive, and Gorky was clearly more interested in creating memorable characters than in advancing a formal plot. However, in this respect, the play is generally regarded as a masterwork.

The theme of harsh truth versus the comforting lie pervades the play from start to finish, as most of the characters choose to deceive themselves over the bleak reality of their condition.

==Characters==
* Mikhail Ivanov Kostylyov – keeper of a night lodging
* Vasilisa Karpovna – his wife
* Natasha – her sister
* Medvedev – her uncle, a policeman
* Vaska Pepel – a young thief 
* Andrei Mitritch Kleshtсh – a locksmith
* Anna – his wife
* Nastya – a street-walker
* Kvashnya – a vendor of meat-pies
* Bubnov – a cap-maker
* The Baron
* Satine
* The Actor 
* Luka – a pilgrim
* Alyoshka – a shoemaker 
* The Tatar 
* Krivoi Zob

==Plot==
In the cellar of a small boarding house, thin boards partition off the room of Vaska, a young thief. In the kitchen live Kvashnya (Dough), a vendor of meat pies, the decrepit Baron, and the streetwalker Nastya. Other lodgers sleep in bunks in the same room.

Nastya is reading a novel titled &quot;Fatal Love&quot;. The Baron, who lives largely on Nastya&#x27;s earnings, seizes the book and mocks Nastya. Satin rises from his bunk, knowing only that he took a beating the night before, and the others tell him he had been caught cheating at cards. The Actor wakes in his bed on top of the stove. He predicts that someday Satin will be beaten to death.

The Actor reminds the Baron to sweep the floor to satisfy the strict landlady. The Baron and Kvashnya leave to go shopping. The Actor claims a doctor has told him he has an organ poisoned by alcohol, and sweeping the floor would be bad for his health. Anna, who is dying of consumption, lies in her bunk while her husband, Kleshtch (Tick), works at his bench, fitting old keys and locks. Anna offers him the dumplings that Kvashnya has left for her in the pot. Kleshtch agrees that there is no use feeding a dying woman, and eats the dumplings. The Actor helps Anna down from her bed and into the hall. As they go through the door, the landlord, Kostylyov, enters, nearly knocking them down. He looks around the dirty cellar and tells Kleshtch that he is taking up too much room and that henceforth the rent will be increased. Then Kostylyov asks Vaska furtively if his wife has been in; he suspects that his wife, Vasilisa, is sleeping with Vaska. The thief comes out of his room and denounces the landlord for not paying his debts, saying that Kostylyov still owes seven roubles for a watch he had bought. Ordering Kostylyov to produce the money immediately, Vaska sends him out of the room. The others admire Vaska for his courage and urge him to kill Kostylyov and marry Vasilisa, so he can be the landlord. Vaska decides that he is too softhearted to be a landlord, especially as he is thinking of discarding Vasilisa for her sister, Natasha. Satin asks Vaska for twenty kopecks, which he gives him.

Natasha comes in with the tramp Luka, who is put in the kitchen to sleep with the three already there. Luka begins to sing, but the others object. When Vasilisa comes in, she gives orders for an immediate sweeping of the floor. She asks to see Luka&#x27;s passport, but he has none, making him more readily accepted by the others. Medvedev, who is a policeman and Vasilisa&#x27;s uncle, enters the cellar and begins to question Luka, but when the tramp calls him sergeant, Medvedev leaves him alone.

That night, Anna lies in her bunk while a noisy card game goes on. Luka talks gently to her, and Kleshtch comes occasionally to check on her. Luka remarks that her death will be hard on her husband, but Anna accuses Kleshtch of causing her death, and says that she looks forward to rest and peace after her death.

The card players become louder and Satin is accused of cheating. Luka quietens them down. He tells Vaska that he will be able to reform in Siberia, and he assures the Actor that at a sanatorium he could be cured of alcoholism. Vasilisa comes in and offers Vaska three hundred rubles to kill Kostylyov. Vaska knows he would be free to marry Natasha, who is recovering from a beating given to her by her jealous sister, and he is about to refuse when Kostylyov enters; Vaska pushes him out of the cellar.

Luka has overheard everything and warns Vaska not to have anything to do with Vasilisa. Luka sees that Anna is dead and Kleshtch is brought to look at her body, which he agrees to take outside. The Actor begins to cavort in joy, saying he has made up his mind to go to the sanatorium. Luka has told him that he can even be cured at state expense.

In the backyard that night, as Natasha is telling romantic stories to the crowd, Kostylyov comes out and orders her back to work. As she goes in, Vasilisa pours boiling water on Natasha&#x27;s feet. Vaska attempts to rescue her and knocks Kostylyov down, and in the ensuing brawl Kostylyov is killed. Vasilisa immediately accuses Vaska of murder. Natasha thinks that Vaska has murdered Kostylyov for the sake of Vasilisa.

Sensing trouble, Luka disappears. Vaska escapes a police search, and Natasha is taken to the hospital, while the rest of the down-and-outers continue as before. Satin cheats at cards, and the Baron tries to convince the others of his former affluence. They all agree that Luka was a liar.

During a bitter quarrel with Nastya, the Baron steps outside. Satin and the others begin singing, but they break off when the Baron bursts in with the news of the actor&#x27;s suicide, to which Satin retorts: &quot;You spoiled the song, you idiot&quot;.

==Production history==
The characters of &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; are said to have been inspired by the denizens of the Bugrov Homeless Shelter (, ) in Nizhny Novgorod, which had been built in 1880–1883 by the Old Believer grain merchant and philanthropist Nikolai Alexandrovich Bugrov in memory of his father, A. P. Bugrov. When the actors of the Moscow Arts Theatre were preparing the play for its first run in 1902, Maxim Gorky supplied them with photographs of the Nizhny Novgorod underclass taken by the famous local photographer, Maxim Dmitriev, to help with the realism of the acting and costumes.

==Film versions==

* 1921: Japanese film: Minoru Murata directed a silent film called &quot;Souls on the Road&quot; (Rojō no Reikon), based on this play.
* 1936: French film director Jean Renoir made a 1936 film of the same name as the play.
* 1946: Indian film producer-director Chetan Anand began his career as a film director with &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; (&quot;Lowly City&quot;), which was a Hindi film adaptation in an Indian setting. &quot;Neecha Nagar&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or (Best Film Award, then known as the &#x27;Grand Prix&#x27;), at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946, becoming the first Indian independent film to get international recognition.
*1947: The Chinese film &quot;Night Inn&quot; (夜店), by director Huang Zuolin, is based on Ke Ling&#x27;s Chinese theatrical adaptation of &quot;The Lower Depths&quot;. The film stars Shanghai singer Zhou Xuan.
*1952: The Moscow Art Theatre production of the play was filmed by Soviet director A. Frolov in conjunction with Mosfilm studio and released as a feature film in the USSR.
* 1957: Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa adapted the story into the film &quot;Donzoko&quot; (&quot;The Lower Depths&quot;), starring Toshiro Mifune, in which the characters have been moved to Edo period Japan.
* 1966: Finnish director Mikko Niskanen shot the play as a telefilm in Finnish but retained the original setting.

==Influences==
Gorky&#x27;s play has been recognized as an important influence on Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 1946 drama &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;. In the dog pound scene from the 1955 Disney animated film &quot;Lady and the Tramp,&quot; the incarcerated homeless Russian Wolfhound, Boris, quotes a passage from the play: &quot;Miserable being must find more miserable being. Then is happy.&quot;

From 1984 to 2000, Farmer commenced his passion of ultra-marathon running while working with his brother Tony as a landscape gardener, and later as a motivational speaker.

During this period, Farmer set a number of ultra-marathon Australian and world records, which placed him in the elite of the sport. Before entering politics in 2001, he raised significant funds for Diabetes Australia, Lifeline, Careflight International, and the Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research.

He is perhaps best known for his record-breaking Centenary of Federation run around all of Australia in 1999, taking 191 days. This event raised considerable funds for charity.

===2011–2012: Pole to Pole Run===
In his valedictory speech to Parliament on 23 June 2010, Pat Farmer formally announced his long-held goal of running from the North Pole to the South Pole, covering some , to raise funds for clean water programs for Red Cross International. Farmer departed the North Pole on 8 April 2011 and finished at the South Pole on 19 January 2012, raising for his efforts. Though the project is called &quot;Pole to Pole&quot; he had stages where he was allowed to take vehicles. Therefore, the record has never been ratified. In March 2012, John Howard launched Farmer&#x27;s memoirs on the journey, called &quot;Pole to pole: one man, 20 million steps&quot;. Interviewed on Radio National &quot;Breakfast&quot;, Farmer stated that proceeds of book sales would go to Red Cross&#x27;s campaign for clean water programs.

===2023: Run for the Voice===
On 17 April 2023, Farmer set out from the capital of Tasmania, Hobart, beginning his run around Australia. His goal is to raise awareness, support and engagement for the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, ahead of the referendum on the matter scheduled for later in the year. The marathon starts with a run in Tasmania, before Farmer flies to Perth and runs around the entire continent in a clockwise direction, finishing in Uluru in central Australia. He trained by running every single day, with a gym session most afternoons.

The launch was attended by prime minister Anthony Albanese.

==Political career==
Following his ultra-marathon Centenary of Federation run in 1999, Farmer was approached by John Howard in 2000 and encouraged to seek Liberal endorsement for the Sydney-area seat of Division of Macarthur. The seat had been reconfigured to be a notional Labor seat after losing nearly all of its rural territory, but Farmer retained it for the Liberals on a swing of seven percent, and actually won enough primary votes to take the seat without the need for preferences. He was returned in 2004 with an increased margin.

During his time in Parliament, Farmer served on a range of House of Representatives committees including: Education and Training from 26 September 2002 to 31 August 2004; Communications, Information Technology and the Arts from 4 November 2003 to 31 August 2004. On 26 October 2004 he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training (with special responsibility for Western Sydney).

Farmer suffered a 10.43% swing against him at the 2007 federal election, in which the Howard government lost to Kevin Rudd&#x27;s Labor Party. Farmer retained his seat with a margin of 0.7 percent, becoming the first opposition MP in the seat&#x27;s history. After the election he was appointed the Shadow Minister for Youth and Sport.

In January 2008 he moved to Mosman on Sydney&#x27;s harbourside against the advice of then Liberal Party leader Brendan Nelson, but stated that it would not affect his ability to represent his electorate in the city&#x27;s western suburbs. On 22 September he was dropped from the shadow ministry by the newly elected opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull. In August 2009 Farmer was reported to be considering standing for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly after a redistribution erased his already tenuous margin in Macarthur, making it notionally Labor.

In a Liberal Party pre-selection ballot for Macarthur held on 30 October 2009, Farmer was defeated by Russell Matheson, and retired from politics at the 2010 federal election. His stock was considerably weakened in 2007 when he moved to the North Shore suburb of Mosman, far outside his electorate.

On 2 February 2015, Farmer announced that he would be contesting the 2015 New South Wales state election as the Liberal candidate in Macquarie Fields, which included a small slice of his old federal seat. He got a significant boost from a redistribution that made the Labor-held seat notionally Liberal. However, he was defeated on a nearly 10-point swing by Labor candidate Anoulack Chanthivong.

Farmer unsuccessfully contested Maroubra as the Liberal candidate at the 2019 New South Wales state election.

==Recognition ==
In 2000 Farmer was named Achiever of the Year at the Australian of the Year Awards, presented by prime minister John Howard.

In May 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal, as a &quot;Multi-world record holder for ultra-marathon running &amp; extremely successful charity fundraiser.

In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday list in June 2015, he was made a Member of the Order of Australia, &quot;For significant service to the community through fundraising support for charitable organisations, to ultra-marathon running, and to the Parliament of Australia&quot;.

==Personal life ==
In 1992, he married Lisa Bullivant, and they bought land in Catherine Field, where they began building their family home. They went on to have two children, Brooke and Dillon. In 1998, Lisa, aged 31, died unexpectedly of mitral valve prolapse and Farmer was left to raise his two children on his own.

<doc id="565879" wikidata="Q213326" url="?curid=565879" title="The Incredibles">
<text>The Incredibles is a 2004 American animated superhero film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. Written and directed by Brad Bird, it stars the voices of Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Jason Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and Elizabeth Peña. Set in a retro-futuristic version of the 1960s, the film follows Bob and Helen Parr, a couple of superheroes, known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, respectively, who hide their powers in accordance with a government mandate, and attempt to live a quiet suburban life with their three children. However, Bob&#x27;s desire to help people draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful fan-turned-foe.

Bird, who was Pixar&#x27;s first outside director, developed the film as an extension of the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after Warner Bros.&#x27; box office disappointment of his first feature, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film&#x27;s orchestral score.

&quot;The Incredibles&quot; debuted at the El Capitan Theatre on October 24, 2004, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5. It earned $632million worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004. &quot;The Incredibles&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics, with praise for its animation, screenplay, voice acting, action sequences, sound design, humor, music, and is frequently considered to be one of the greatest superhero movies of all time. The film won Best Animated Feature and Best Sound Editing at the 77th Academy Awards, with two additional nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing, as well as the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature. It was the first entirely animated film to win the prestigious Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. A sequel, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;, was released in June 2018.

== Plot ==

On the day of his wedding with Helen (alias Elastigirl), superhero Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible) thwarts a civilian&#x27;s attempted suicide by tackling him through a skyscraper window. Bob then discovers supervillain Bomb Voyage robbing the building, but is interrupted by his devoted fanboy Buddy Pine, who wants to be his sidekick. Bob rejects Buddy, and Voyage clips a bomb onto Buddy&#x27;s cape. Bob gets the bomb off, but it destroys an elevated train track, forcing Bob to stop an oncoming train. After his wedding, Bob is sued for collateral damage by the suicidal civilian and the injured train passengers. Similar lawsuits create a negative public attitude towards superheroes, and the government initiates the Superhero Relocation Program, banning &quot;supers&quot; from using their powers in public and forcing them into hiding.

Fifteen years later, Bob lives with Helen and their children, Violet, Dash, and baby Jack-Jack, in Metroville. Bob misses his superhero days and resents his mundane job as a claims adjuster, moonlighting as a vigilante with his friend Lucius Best (alias Frozone). One day, Bob injures his supervisor Gilbert Huph after being prevented from stopping a mugging, and is consequently dismissed. That evening, a woman named Mirage secretly offers Bob a mission to subdue a giant &quot;Omnidroid&quot; robot loose on Nomanisan island. Bob succeeds by tricking the machine into ripping out its own power source. Rejuvenated by the action and higher pay, Bob trains to get back into shape, and asks superhero costume designer Edna Mode to fix a tear in his old suit. Incorrectly assuming that Helen knows of Bob&#x27;s new job, Edna makes new suits for the entire family.

Summoned back to Nomanisan, Bob discovers Mirage is working for Buddy, now calling himself Syndrome after being embittered by Bob&#x27;s rejection. Syndrome has become wealthy by inventing weapons that mimic superpowers. He has been perfecting the Omnidroid by luring supers to fight it until it kills them. Syndrome intends to send an Omnidroid to attack Metroville, then defeat it publicly with secret controls, thereby gaining &quot;hero&quot; status. He intends to then sell his inventions to the world, thereby rendering superheroes obsolete.

Helen visits Edna and learns what Bob has been up to. She activates a beacon Edna built into the suits to find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be captured while infiltrating Syndrome&#x27;s base. Helen borrows a private plane to fly to Nomanisan; Violet and Dash stow away, leaving Jack-Jack with a babysitter. Despite knowing that there are children on the plane, Syndrome shoots it down. Helen and the kids survive and make it to the island. Disillusioned by Syndrome&#x27;s callousness, Mirage releases Bob and informs him of his family&#x27;s survival. Syndrome&#x27;s guards pursue Dash and Violet, who fend them off with their powers and reunite with their parents. Syndrome captures the family before following the Omnidroid to Metroville. Violet uses her powers to free her family, and Mirage helps them reach Metroville.

Recognizing Syndrome&#x27;s remote-control gauntlet as a threat, the Omnidroid disarms and knocks him out. The Incredibles and Lucius fight the Omnidroid; Helen and the kids retrieve the remote control, allowing Bob to destroy the robot&#x27;s power source. The Parrs and Lucius are hailed by the public just as Syndrome awakens to see their victory. Returning home, the Parrs find Syndrome abducting Jack-Jack to raise as a sidekick as revenge. As Syndrome flies away, Jack-Jack&#x27;s superpowers manifest, and he escapes Syndrome&#x27;s hold. Helen rescues the falling baby, and Bob throws his car at Syndrome&#x27;s plane, knocking him into one of its engines.

Three months later, the Parrs witness the arrival of supervillain the Underminer. They don their masks and suits, ready to face the new threat.

== Production ==
=== Development and writing ===

&quot;The Incredibles&quot; as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during an uncertain point in his film career. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had signed a production deal with Warner Bros. Feature Animation and was in the process of directing his first feature, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, &quot;Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie.&quot; After the box office failure of &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.

He imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000. &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters with a history of working for the company. In addition, it would be the studio&#x27;s first film in which all characters are human.
Bird came to Pixar with the lineup of the story&#x27;s family members worked out: a mom and dad, both suffering through the dad&#x27;s midlife crisis; a shy teenage girl; a cocky ten-year-old boy; and a baby. Bird had based their powers on family archetypes. During production, Hayao Miyazaki of Studio Ghibli visited Pixar and saw the film&#x27;s story reels. When Bird asked if the reels made any sense or if they were just &quot;American nonsense,&quot; Miyazaki replied, through an interpreter, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a very adventurous thing you are trying to do in an American film.&quot;

Syndrome was originally written as a minor character who assaults Bob and Helen at the beginning of the movie, only to die in an explosion that destroys the Parrs&#x27; house (in this version, the Smiths), but he was made the main antagonist because the filmmakers liked him more than the character of Xerek, who was intended to fulfill that role. The Snug character that Helen talks to at the phone in the final film was intended to fly Helen to Nomanisan Island and to die, but he was removed from that position when Lasseter suggested having Helen pilot the plane herself. Syndrome was based on Brad Bird himself.

=== Casting ===
Holly Hunter, cast as Helen Parr/Elastigirl, never voiced an animated character before and saw the role as an exciting opportunity to expand her repertoire. She was also drawn to the film by its unique and &quot;unconventional story about family and human dynamics&quot;. Bird considered Hunter &quot;one of the finest actresses in the world&quot;, capable of playing a &quot;sensitive&quot; character who also has &quot;a very sturdy center&quot;. Like Hunter, Craig T. Nelson also had never done a voice role but had wondered about wanting to do a role after he recalled seeing &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; again; he did his voicework when not working on &quot;The District&quot;, which he was starring in at the time of the sessions, which took over two years. Spencer Fox was cast as Dash Parr, which was also his feature film debut. Brad Bird wanted to give Dash a realistic out-of-breath voice in certain scenes such as the jungle scene so he made Fox run four laps around the Pixar studio until he got tired. Samuel L. Jackson was cast as Lucius Best/Frozone, Bird cast him because he stated that he wanted the character to have the coolest voice. Lily Tomlin was originally considered for the role of Edna Mode, but later turned it down. After several failed attempts to cast Edna Mode, Bird took on her voice role himself. It was an extension of the Pixar custom of tapping in-house staff whose voices came across particularly well on scratch dialogue tracks. Sarah Vowell was offered the role of Violet unexpectedly; Bird wanted to cast Vowell as Violet after hearing her voice on the National Public Radio program, &quot;This American Life&quot;. Bird stated that she was &quot;perfect&quot; for the part and immediately called her to offer her the role.

=== Animation ===
Upon Pixar&#x27;s acceptance of the project, Brad Bird was asked to bring in his own team for the production. He brought up a core group of people he worked with on &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. Because of this, many 2D artists had to make the shift to 3D, including Bird himself. Bird found working with CGI &quot;wonderfully malleable&quot; in a way that traditional animation is not, calling the camera&#x27;s ability to easily switch angles in a given scene &quot;marvelously adaptable.&quot; He found working in computer animation &quot;difficult&quot; in a different way than working traditionally, finding the software &quot;sophisticated and not particularly friendly.&quot; Bird wrote the script without knowing the limitations or concerns that went hand-in-hand with the medium of computer animation. As a result, this was to be the most complex film yet for Pixar. The film&#x27;s characters were designed by Tony Fucile and Teddy Newton, whom Bird had brought with him from Warner Bros. Like most computer-animated films, &quot;The Incredibles&quot; had a year-long period of building the film from the inside out: modeling the exterior and understanding controls that would work the face and the body—the articulation of the character—before animation could even begin. Bird and Fucile tried to emphasize the graphic quality of good 2D animation to the Pixar team, who had only worked primarily in CGI. Bird attempted to incorporate teaching from Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men that the crew at Pixar had &quot;never really emphasized.&quot;

For the technical crew members, the film&#x27;s human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird&#x27;s story was filled with elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely considered to be the most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar&#x27;s animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although the technical team had some experience with hair and cloth in &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for &quot;The Incredibles&quot; had never been done by Pixar up until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; in fact, this was integral to her character. Violet&#x27;s long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair both underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, thinking that a live-action film would be preferable, but Lasseter denied this.

Not only did &quot;The Incredibles&quot; cope with the difficulty of animating CGI humans, but also many other complications. The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four times the number of locations. Supervising technical director Rick Sayre noted that the hardest thing about the film was that there was &quot;no hardest thing,&quot; alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans. The film&#x27;s organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team. Sayre said the team adopted &quot;Alpha Omega,&quot; where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading, and layout, while another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed the &quot;character team,&quot; digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded all of the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing. There were at least 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. Additionally, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.

The skin of the characters gained a new level of realism from a technology to mimic &quot;subsurface scattering.&quot; The challenges did not stop with modeling humans. Bird decided that in a shot near the film&#x27;s end, baby Jack-Jack would have to undergo a series of transformations, and in one of the five planned he would turn himself into a kind of goo. Technical directors, who anticipated spending two months or even longer to work out the goo effect, stealing precious hours from production that had already entered its final and most critical stages, petitioned the film&#x27;s producer, John Walker, for help. Bird, who had himself brought Walker over from Warner Bros. to work on the project, was at first immovable, but after arguing with Walker in several invective-laced meetings over the course of two months, Bird finally conceded. Bird also insisted that the storyboards define the blocking of characters&#x27; motions, lighting, and camera movements, which had previously been left to other departments rather than storyboarded.

Bird admitted that he &quot;had the knees of [the studio] trembling under the weight&quot; of &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, but called the film a &quot;testament to the talent of the animators at Pixar,&quot; who were admiring the challenges the film provoked. He recalled, &quot;Basically, I came into a wonderful studio, frightened a lot of people with how many presents I wanted for Christmas, and then got almost everything I asked for.&quot;

=== Music ===

&quot;The Incredibles&quot; is the first Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino. Brad Bird was looking for a specific sound as inspired by the film&#x27;s retrofuturistic design – the future as seen from the 1960s. John Barry was the first choice to do the film&#x27;s score, with a trailer of the film given a rerecording of Barry&#x27;s theme to &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. However, Barry did not wish to duplicate the sound of some of his earlier soundtracks; the assignment was instead given to Giacchino. Giacchino noted that recording in the 1960s was largely different from modern day recording and Dan Wallin, the recording engineer, said that Bird wanted an old feel, and as such the score was recorded on analog tapes. Wallin noted that brass instruments, which are at the forefront of the film&#x27;s score, sound better on analog equipment rather than digital. Wallin came from an era in which music was recorded, according to Giacchino, &quot;the right way,&quot; which consists of everyone in the same room, &quot;playing against each other and feeding off each other&#x27;s energy.&quot; Many of Giacchino&#x27;s future soundtracks followed suit with this style of mixing. Tim Simonec was the conductor/orchestrator for the score&#x27;s recording.

The film&#x27;s orchestral score was released on November 2, 2004, by Walt Disney Records, three days before the film opened in theaters. It won numerous awards for best score including Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award, BMI Film &amp; TV Award, ASCAP Film and Television Music Award, Annie Award, Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award and Online Film Critics Society Award and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, Satellite Award and Broadcast Film Critics Association Award.

== Themes ==
Several film reviewers drew precise parallels between the film and certain superhero comic books, like &quot;Powers&quot;, &quot;Watchmen&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, and &quot;The Avengers&quot;. The producers of the 2005 adaptation of &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being &quot;the most well-trod turf on the planet,&quot; but noted that he had not been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of &quot;Watchmen&quot;. He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it, since &quot;if you&#x27;re going to be compared to something, it&#x27;s nice if it&#x27;s something good&quot;.

Some commentators took Bob&#x27;s frustration with celebrating mediocrity and Syndrome&#x27;s comment that &quot;when everyone&#x27;s super, no one will be&quot; as a reflection of views shared by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche or an extension of Russian-American novelist Ayn Rand&#x27;s Objectivism philosophy, which Bird felt was &quot;ridiculous.&quot; He stated that a large portion of the audience understood the message as he intended whereas &quot;two percent thought I was doing &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; or &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.&quot; Some purported that &quot;The Incredibles&quot; exhibited a right-wing bias, which Bird also scoffed at. &quot;I think that&#x27;s as silly of an analysis as saying &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; was left-wing. I&#x27;m definitely a centrist and feel like both parties can be absurd.&quot;

The film also explored Bird&#x27;s dislike for the tendency of the children&#x27;s comics and Saturday morning cartoons of his youth to portray villains as unrealistic, ineffectual, and non-threatening. In the film, Dash and Violet have to deal with villains who are perfectly willing to use deadly force against children. On another level, both Dash and Violet display no emotion or regret at the deaths of those who are trying to kill them, such as when Dash outruns pursuers who crash their vehicles while chasing him, or when both of them witness their parents destroy several attacking vehicles with people inside, in such a manner that the deaths of those piloting them is undeniable. Despite disagreeing with some analysis, Bird felt it gratifying for his work to be considered on many different levels, which was his intention: &quot;The fact that it was written about in the op/ed section of &quot;The New York Times&quot; several times was really gratifying to me. Look, it&#x27;s a mainstream animated movie, and how often are those considered thought provoking?&quot;

== Release ==

=== Marketing ===
A teaser trailer of &quot;The Incredibles&quot; premiered on May 30, 2003, and was attached to the screenings of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. Several companies released promotional products related to the film. In the weeks before the film&#x27;s opening, there were also promotional tie-ins with SBC Communications (using Dash to promote the &quot;blazing-fast speed&quot; of its SBC Yahoo! DSL service) Tide, Downy, Bounce and McDonald&#x27;s. Dark Horse Comics released a limited series of comic books based on the film. Toy maker Hasbro produced a series of action figures and toys based on the film. Kellogg&#x27;s released an Incredibles-themed cereal, as well as promotional Pop-Tarts and fruit snacks, all proclaiming an &quot;Incrediberry Blast&quot; of flavor. Pringles included potato chips featuring the superheroes and quotes from the film. In July 2008, it was announced that a series of comic books based on the film would be published by BOOM! Studios in collaboration with Disney Publishing by the end of the year. The first miniseries by BOOM! was &quot;The Incredibles: Family Matters&quot; by Mark Waid and Marcio Takara, which was published from March to June 2009 and collected into a trade paperback published in July of that year.

=== Theatrical ===
&quot;The Incredibles&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on November 5, 2004. In theaters, &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was accompanied by a short film, &quot;Boundin&#x27;&quot; (2003). The theatrical release also included sneak peeks for &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;. While Pixar celebrated another triumph with &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, Steve Jobs was embroiled in a public feud with the head of its distribution partner, The Walt Disney Company. This would eventually lead to the ousting of Michael Eisner and Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Pixar the following year. In March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger announced that the film would be reformatted and re-released in 3D. &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was re-released and digitally re-mastered for IMAX theaters (alongside its sequel, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;) using their DMR Technology in a double feature on June 14, 2018.

As part of Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary &quot;The Incredibles&quot; was re-released between September 1 to 14, 2023 in the United States and October 5 to 11 in Latin America.

=== Home media ===
The film was first released on both VHS and a two-disc collector&#x27;s edition DVD set on March 15, 2005. The DVD set was THX certified, consisted of widescreen and a pan and scan fullscreen versions and included two newly commissioned Pixar short films, &quot;Jack-Jack Attack&quot; and &quot;Mr. Incredible and Pals&quot;, which were made specifically for this home-video release, and &quot;Boundin&quot;&#x27;, a Pixar short film that premiered alongside the feature film in its original theatrical release. The VHS release only featured the short, &quot;Boundin&#x27;.&quot; It was the highest-selling DVD of 2005, with 17.38 million copies sold. The film was also released on UMD for the Sony PSP. Disney released the film on Blu-ray in North America on April 12, 2011, and on 4K UHD Blu-ray on June 5, 2018; this marks Disney&#x27;s first 4K Blu-ray reissue on the format.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Incredibles&quot; earned $261.4million in the United States and Canada and $370.1million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $631.6million. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2004, behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

&quot;The Incredibles&quot; was released with &quot;Alfie&quot; on November 5, 2004. It debuted earning $70.7million from 3,933 theaters. This made it the second-highest opening weekend for an animated film, trailing only behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. The film opened in the number #1 spot at the box office, dominating &quot;Saw&quot;, &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, &quot;Ray&quot;, &quot;Ladder 49&quot; and other films. Despite its opening, the overall Hollywood revenues fell, continuing a box office slump that had lingered for most of the fall season. The top 12 movies took in $136.1 million down to 5% from the same weekend the previous year, just after the openings of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and &quot;Elf&quot;. For 15 years, &quot;The Incredibles&quot; had the biggest November opening weekend for an animated film until it was dethroned by &quot;Frozen II&quot; in 2019. It continued to rule the box office while staying ahead of &quot;The Polar Express&quot;. Its second weekend earnings dropped by 28% to $51million, and followed by another $26million the third weekend. &quot;The Incredibles&quot; completed its theatrical run in the United States and Canada on April 14, 2005.

=== Critical response ===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of &quot;A+&quot; on an A+ to F scale, making it Pixar&#x27;s fourth (consecutive) film to receive this grade (after &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, and &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;).

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four, writing that the film &quot;alternates breakneck action with satire of suburban sitcom life&quot; and is &quot;another example of Pixar&#x27;s mastery of popular animation.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also gave the film three-and-a-half, calling it &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best&quot; and saying that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t ring cartoonish, it rings true.&quot; Giving the film three-and-a-half as well, &quot;People&quot; magazine found that &quot;The Incredibles&quot; &quot;boasts a strong, entertaining story and a truckload of savvy comic touches.&quot;

Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; was bored by the film&#x27;s &quot;recurring pastiches of earlier action films&quot;, concluding that &quot;the Pixar whizzes do what they do excellently; you just wish they were doing something else.&quot; Jessica Winter of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; criticized the film for &quot;playing as a standard summer action film&quot;, despite being released in early November. Her review, titled as &quot;Full Metal Racket,&quot; noted that &quot;The Incredibles&quot; &quot;announces the studio&#x27;s arrival in the vast yet overcrowded Hollywood lot of eardrum-bashing, metal-crunching action sludge.&quot; Laura Clifford of &quot;Reeling Reviews&quot; gave the film an A- and said, &quot;Mix &quot;X-Men&quot; with &quot;True Lies&quot; and &quot;Spy Kids&quot; then add the retro design of &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; all tied together with the magical technology of Pixar.&quot; In a positive review, Jennifer Frey of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; explained that &quot;the movie is full of wonderful little touches: Syndrome, the bad guy, is drawn to remind viewers of Heat Miser from the classic Christmas cartoon &quot;The Year Without a Santa Claus&quot;. As always, Pixar excels with its animation, but what makes this family film even more appealing is the smartness of the script, which is clearly written, end to end, to appeal to adults as well as children.&quot;

&quot;The Incredibles&quot; was included on a number of best-of lists. It appeared on professional rankings from &quot;The Guardian&quot; based on retrospective appraisal, as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century. Travers also named it as number 6 on his list of the decade&#x27;s best films. Several publications have listed it as one of the best animated films, including: &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (2009), &quot;IGN&quot; (2010), &quot;Insider&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot; (all 2018), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (2019), &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Complex&quot;, &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot; (all 2021). &quot;The Incredibles&quot; appeared on several lists of the best superhero films, by outlets including: &quot;Time&quot; (2011), &quot;Paste&quot;, &quot;Vulture&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; (all 2019), &quot;IGN&quot; (2020), &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, and &quot;Parade&quot; (all 2021). In December 2021, the film&#x27;s screenplay was listed number 48 on the Writers Guild of America&#x27;s &quot;101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)&quot;. Others have named it one of the best conservative films, best action films, and best political films.

=== Accolades ===

&quot;The Incredibles&quot; led the 77th Academy Awards season with four nominations (including Best Original Screenplay and Sound Mixing). It received two Oscars: Best Animated Feature and Sound Editing. Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called &quot;The Incredibles&quot; the year&#x27;s best picture. &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine released a cross-section of all the top critics in America and &quot;The Incredibles&quot; placed at number three, whereas review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes cross-referenced reviews that suggested it was its year&#x27;s highest-rated film.

The film also received the 2004 Annie Award for Best Animated Feature and the 2005 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form, and it was nominated for the 2004 Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. It also won the Saturn Award for Best Animated Film. The American Film Institute included it as one of the top 10 films of 2004.

It was included on Empire&#x27;s 500 Greatest Films of All Time at number 400.

== Video games ==
It has received several game adaptations: &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (2004), &quot;The Incredibles: When Danger Calls&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer&quot; (2005). &quot;Kinect Rush: A Disney–Pixar Adventure&quot; (2012) features characters and worlds from five Pixar films, including &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; (2013) includes &quot;The Incredibles&quot; playset featuring the film&#x27;s playable characters. &quot;Lego The Incredibles&quot; was released in June 2018.

== Sequel ==

A sequel, titled &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;, was released on June 15, 2018 and was once again a critical and commercial success, although it was considered inferior in comparison to its predecessor.

<text>The Makarov pistol or PM () is a Soviet semi-automatic pistol. Under the project leadership of Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov, it became the Soviet Union&#x27;s standard military and Militsiya side arm in 1951.

==Development==
Shortly after the Second World War, the Soviet Union reactivated its plans to replace the TT pistols and Nagant M1895 revolvers. The adoption of the future AK assault rifle relegated the pistol to a light, handy self-defense weapon. The TT was unsuited for such a role, as it was heavy and bulky. Also, the Tokarev pistols omitted a safety and magazines were deemed too easy to lose. As a result, in December 1945, two separate contests for a new service pistol were created, respectively for a 7.62mm and 9mm pistol. It was later judged that the new 9.2×18mm cartridge, designed by B. V. Semin, was the best round suited for the intended role. The lower pressures of the cartridge allowed practical straight blowback operation (reducing the cost and complexity of the weapon), while retaining low recoil and good stopping power.

Several engineers took part in the contest, including Korovin, Baryshev, Voyevodin, Simonov, Rakov, Klimov, Lobanov, Sevryugin, and Makarov. Special emphasis was placed on safety, user-friendliness, accuracy, weight, and dimensions. After stringent handling, reliability, and other tests, Makarov&#x27;s design, influenced by the German Walther PP, stood out from the others through its sheer simplicity, excellent reliability, quick disassembly, and robustness. During April 1948, Makarov&#x27;s pistol experienced 20 times fewer malfunctions than the competing Baryshev and Sevryugin counterparts, and had fewer parts. The pistol was therefore selected in 1949 for further development and optimization for mass production. Tooling was set up in the Izhevsk plant for production. After many significant design changes and tweaks, the gun was formally adopted as the &quot;9mm Pistolet Makarova&quot;, or &quot;PM&quot; in December 1951.

As the new standard issue sidearm of the USSR, the PM was issued to non-commissioned officers, police, special forces, and tank and air crews. It remained in wide front-line service with Soviet military and police until and beyond the end of the USSR in 1991. Variants of the pistol remain in production in Russia, China, and Bulgaria. In the U.S., surplus Soviet and East German military Makarovs are listed as eligible curio and relic items by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, because the countries of manufacture, the USSR and the GDR, no longer exist.

In 2003, the Makarov PM was formally replaced by the PYa pistol in Russian service, although , large numbers of Makarov pistols are still in Russian military and police service. The PM is still the service pistol of many Eastern European and former Soviet republics. North Korea and Vietnam also use PMs as standard-issue pistols, however North Korea has since switched to the CZ-75 made locally as the BaekDuSan pistol.

Although various pistols had been introduced in Russian service to replace the Makarov, none have been able to entirely supplant it; the MP-443 Grach/PYa is technically the Russian military&#x27;s standard sidearm but suffers from quality control and reliability issues. In September 2019, Rostec announced its Udav pistol went into mass production as the Makarov replacement. The Udav fires 9×21mm Gyurza rounds which are claimed to pierce 1.4 mm of titanium or 4 mm of steel at a 100 meters.

==Design==
The PM is a medium-size, straight-blowback-action, all-steel construction, frame-fixed barrel handgun. In blowback designs, the only force holding the slide closed is that of the recoil spring; upon firing, the barrel and slide do not have to unlock, as do locked-breech-design pistols. Blowback designs are simple and more accurate than designs using a recoiling, tilting, or articulated barrel, but they are limited by the weight of the slide. The 9×18mm cartridge is an appropriate cartridge in blowback-operated pistols; producing a respectable level of energy from a gun of moderate weight and size. The PM is heavy for its size by modern US commercial handgun standards, largely because in a blowback pistol, the heavy slide is necessary as it is relied upon to provide inertia to delay opening of the breech until internal pressures have fallen to a safe level. Other, more powerful cartridges have been used in blowback pistol designs, but the Makarov is widely regarded as particularly well balanced in its design elements.

The general layout and field-strip procedure of the Makarov pistol is similar to that of the PP. However, designer N. Makarov and his team drastically simplified the construction of the pistol, improving reliability and reducing the part count to 27, not including the magazine. This allowed considerable ease of manufacture and servicing. All of the individual parts of the PM have been optimised for mass production, robustness and interchangeability, partially thanks to captured German tooling, technology, and machinery.

The chrome-lined, four-groove, 9.27mm caliber barrel is pressed and pinned to the frame through a precision-machined ring. The 7 kg recoil spring wraps around and is guided by the barrel. The spring-loaded trigger guard is pivoted down and swung to either side on the frame, allowing removal of the slide. The front sight is integrally machined into the slide, and a 3–4 mm wide textured strip is engraved on top of the slide in order to prevent aim-disturbing glare. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and multiple heights are available to adjust the impact point. The extractor is of an external spring-loaded type, and features a prominent flange preventing loss if a case should rupture. The breech face is deeply recessed in order to aid in extraction and ejection reliability. The stamped sheet steel slide-lock lever has a tail serving the purpose of ejector. The one-piece, wraparound bakelite or plastic grip is reinforced with steel inserts and has a detent inside the screw bushing preventing unscrewing during firing. The sheet-metal mainspring housed inside the grip panel powers the hammer in both the main and rebound stroke, the trigger and the disconnector, while its lower end is the heel and spring of the magazine catch. The sear spring also serves another function, powering the slide lock lever. Makarov pistol parts seldom break with normal usage, and are easily serviced using few tools.

The PM has a free-floating triangular firing pin, with no firing pin spring or firing pin block. This theoretically allows the possibility of accidental firing if the pistol is dropped on its muzzle. Designer Nikolay Makarov thought the firing pin of insufficient mass to constitute a major danger. The Makarov pistol is notable for the safety elements of its design, with a safety lever that simultaneously decocks and blocks the hammer from contacting the firing pin and returns the weapon to the long-trigger-pull mode of double action when that safety is engaged. When handled properly, the Makarov pistol has excellent security against accidental discharge caused by inadvertent pressure on the trigger, e.g., in carrying the weapon in dense brush or re-holstering it. However, the heavy trigger weight in double-action mode decreases first-shot accuracy. The Bulgarian-model Makarov pistol was approved for sale in the US state of California, having passed a state-mandated drop-safety test though the certification was not renewed and it has since been removed from the roster of approved handguns.

==Operation==
The PM has a DA/SA trigger mechanism. Engaging the manual safety simultaneously decocks the hammer if cocked, and prevents movement of slide, trigger and hammer. Both carrying with safety engaged, or with safety disengaged and hammer uncocked are considered safe. The DA trigger pull is heavy, requiring a strong squeeze, trading first shot accuracy for safety. Racking the slide, manually cocking the hammer or firing a cartridge all cock the hammer, setting the trigger for the next shot to single action. The PM is a semi-automatic firearm, therefore its rate of fire depends on how rapidly the shooter squeezes the trigger. Spent cartridges are ejected some 5.5–6 meters away to the shooter&#x27;s right and rear. After firing the last round, the slide is held back by the slide stop lever/ejector. Magazines can be removed from the gun via the heel release, located on the bottom of the grip. After loading a fresh magazine, the slide can be released by pressing the lever on the left side of the frame or by racking the slide and releasing it; either action loads a cartridge into the chamber and readies the pistol to fire again.

==Variants==
The Makarov pistol was manufactured in several communist countries during the Cold War and afterwards; apart from the USSR itself, they were East Germany, Bulgaria, China, and post-reunification Germany, which also found itself with several thousand ex-GDR Makarov pistols.

The most widely known variant, the PMM (&quot;Pistolet Makarova Modernizirovannyy&quot; or Modernised Makarov pistol), was a redesign of the original gun. In 1990, a group of engineers reworked the original design, primarily by increasing the load for the cartridge. The result is a significant increase in muzzle velocity and generation of 25% more gas pressure. The PMM magazine holds 12 rounds, compared to the PM&#x27;s eight rounds. Versions that held ten rounds were produced in greater quantities than the 12-round magazine. The PMM is able to use existing 9.2×18mm PM cartridges and has other minor modifications such as more ergonomic grip panels as well as flutes in the chamber that aid in extraction. As of 2015, it is—alongside MP-443 Grach—the service pistol of the Russian Airborne Troops.

A silenced version of the Makarov pistol, the PB, was developed for use by reconnaissance groups and the KGB, with a dedicated detachable suppressor.

An experimental variant of the Makarov pistol, the TKB-023, was designed with a polymer frame to reduce the weight and costs of the weapon. It had passed Soviet military trials but was never fielded, due to concerns about the polymer&#x27;s capacities for long-term storage and use.

Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have developed their own handgun designs chambering the 9×18mm round. Hungary developed the FEG PA-63, Poland the P-64 and the P-83 Wanad and Czechoslovakia the vz.82. As they are similar in operation (straight blowback), and chambered for the same round, these pistols are often found labeled at gun shows by some US gun retailers as &quot;Polish Makarovs&quot; and &quot;Hungarian Makarovs&quot;. Nonetheless, these cosmetically similar designs are independent of the PM and have more in common with the Walther PP (which, in fact, was also a major influence on the original Russian Makarov).

A wide variety of aftermarket additions and replacements exist for the Makarov pistol, including replacement barrels, custom grips, custom finishes and larger sights with various properties to replace the notoriously small originals. A scope/light mount exists for the Makarov pistol but requires a threaded replacement barrel.

===Baikal===
Baikal is a brand developed by Izhevsk Mechanical Plant around which a series of shotgun products were designed from 1962. After the collapse of the USSR, commercial gun manufacture was greatly expanded under the Baikal brand.

During the 1990s, Baikal marketed various Makarov-derived handguns in the United States under the IJ-70 model. Included were handguns in both standard and high-capacity frames. They were available in .380 ACP in addition to the standard 9 mm Makarov round. Some minor modifications were made to facilitate importation into the United States, including the replacement of the rear fixed sight with an adjustable sight (only these Russian models marketed abroad feature an adjustable sight). A sporting version is the Baikal-442. The importation of these commercial models into the U.S. was later further restricted with the U.S. Government&#x27;s importation ban on Russian firearms.

The Baikal IZH-79-8 is a modified version of the standard Makarov pistol, with an 8 mm barrel, modified to allow it to fire gas cartridges. These guns proved popular after the fall of the USSR, and were used in Eastern Europe for personal protection. However, unlike most gas firing guns, the body is made of standard Makarov-specification steel.

<doc id="565896" wikidata="Q3106901" url="?curid=565896" title="Exploding head syndrome">
<text>Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is an abnormal sensory perception during sleep in which a person experiences auditory hallucinations that are loud and of short duration when falling asleep or waking up. The noise may be frightening, typically occurs only occasionally, and is not a serious health concern. People may also experience a flash of light. Pain is typically absent.
The cause is unknown. Potential organic explanations that have been investigated but ruled out include ear problems, temporal lobe seizure, nerve dysfunction, or specific genetic changes. Potential risk factors include psychological stress. It is classified as a sleep disorder or headache disorder. People often go undiagnosed.
There is no high-quality evidence to support treatment. Reassurance may be sufficient. Clomipramine and calcium channel blockers have been tried. While the frequency of the condition is not well studied, some have estimated that it occurs in about 10% of people. Women are reportedly more commonly affected. The condition was initially described at least as early as 1876. The current name came into use in 1988.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Individuals with exploding head syndrome hear or experience loud imagined noises as they are falling asleep or are waking up, have a strong, often frightened emotional reaction to the sound, and do not report significant pain; around 10% of people also experience visual disturbances like perceiving visual static, lightning, or flashes of light. Some people may also experience heat, strange feelings in their torso, or a feeling of electrical tingling that ascends to the head before the auditory hallucinations occur. With the heightened arousal, people experience distress, confusion, myoclonic jerks, tachycardia, sweating, and a feeling that they have stopped breathing and need to make a conscious effort to breathe again.

The pattern of the auditory hallucinations is variable. Some people report having a total of two or four attacks followed by a prolonged or total remission, having attacks over the course of a few weeks or months before the attacks spontaneously disappear, or the attacks may even recur irregularly every few days, weeks, or months for much of a lifetime.

== Causes ==
The cause of EHS is unknown. A number of hypotheses have been put forth with the most common being dysfunction of the reticular formation in the brainstem responsible for transition between waking and sleeping.

Other theories into causes of EHS include:
* Minor seizures affecting the temporal lobe
* Ear dysfunctions, including sudden shifts in middle ear components or the Eustachian tube, or a rupture of the membranous labyrinth or labyrinthine fistula
* Stress and anxiety
* Variable and broken sleep, associated with a decline in delta sleep
* Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome
* Temporary calcium channel dysfunction
* PTSD

Exploding head syndrome was first described in the 19th century, and may have first been mentioned in the 17th century.

==Diagnosis==

Exploding head syndrome is classified under other parasomnias by the 2014 International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD, 3rd.Ed.) and is an unusual type of auditory hallucination in that it occurs in people who are not fully awake.

According to ICD-10 and DSM-5 EHS is classified as either other specified sleep-wake disorder (codes:780.59 or G47.8) or unspecified sleep-wake disorder (codes: 780.59 or G47.9).

== Treatment ==
, no clinical trials had been conducted to determine what treatments are safe and effective; a few case reports had been published describing treatment of small numbers of people (two to twelve per report) with clomipramine, flunarizine, nifedipine, topiramate, carbamazepine. Studies suggest that education and reassurance can reduce the frequency of EHS episodes. There is some evidence that individuals with EHS rarely report episodes to medical professionals.

==Epidemiology==
There have not been sufficient studies to make conclusive statements about how common or who is most often affected. One study found that 14% of a sample of undergrads reported at least one episode over the course of their lives, with higher rates in those who also have sleep paralysis.

==History==
Case reports of EHS have been published since at least 1876, which Silas Weir Mitchell described as &quot;sensory discharges&quot; in a patient. However, it has been suggested that the earliest written account of EHS was described in the biography of the French philosopher René Descartes in 1691. The phrase &quot;snapping of the brain&quot; was coined in 1920 by the British physician and psychiatrist Robert Armstrong-Jones. A detailed description of the syndrome and the name &quot;exploding head syndrome&quot; was given by British neurologist John M. S. Pearce in 1989. More recently, Peter Goadsby and Brian Sharpless have proposed renaming EHS &quot;episodic cranial sensory shock&quot; as it describes the symptoms more accurately and better attributes to Mitchell.

<doc id="565898" wikidata="Q434252" url="?curid=565898" title="Mihailo Obrenović, Prince of Serbia">
<text>Mihailo Obrenović (; 16 September 1823 – 10 June 1868) was the ruling Prince of Serbia from 1839 to 1842 and again from 1860 to 1868. 

His first reign ended when he was deposed in 1842, and his second ended when he was assassinated in 1868. He is considered to be a great reformer and the most enlightened ruler of modern Serbia, as one of the European enlightened absolute monarchs. He succeeded in negotiating a withdrawal of Ottoman troops from Serbian soil, while retaining certain Serbian ties to Constantinople. He advocated the idea of a Balkan federation against the Ottoman Empire.

==Early life==
Mihailo was the son of Miloš Obrenović, Prince of Serbia (1780–1860) and his wife, Ljubica, Princess of Serbia (1788–1843, Vienna). He was born in Kragujevac, the second surviving son of the couple. In 1823, he became the first person in Serbia to be vaccinated against smallpox, which took away the lives of three of his siblings: Petar, Marija and Velika. He spent his childhood in Kragujevac, then in Požarevac and Belgrade. Having finished his education in Požarevac, Mihailo left Serbia with his mother to go to Vienna. His elder brother by four years, Milan Obrenović II, born in 1819, was frequently in poor health.

==First reign==

Initially, Prince Miloš abdicated in favour of his firstborn son, Prince Milan Obrenović II, who was by then terminally ill and died after just one month of rule. After the death of his elder brother, Mihailo came to the throne as a minor, having been born in late 1823, and proclaimed prince on 25 June 1839. He was declared of full age the following year. Few thrones appeared more secure, and his rule might have endured throughout his life but for his want of energy and inattention to political developments. During his first reign, on 19 November 1841 he has founded Society of Serbian Letters, but his inexperience meant he did not cope well with some other important challenges Serbia faced.
On 14 September 1842, his reign was ended by a rebellion led by Toma Vučić-Perišić, which enabled the Karađorđević dynasty to assume power and stay on the throne for another sixteen years.

== Life in exile, forbidden love, marriage==
After the overthrow, Prince Mihailo withdrew from Serbia across the rivers of Sava and Danube with around one thousand of his adherents. His destiny was decided by Austria and Turkey. Prince Mihailo was directed to the estate of his sister, Princess Jelisaveta Obrenović, Baroness Nikolić de Rudna (1818-1848), while his mother, Princess Ljubica was sent to Novi Sad. She died there alone in 1843. Mihailo organized her burial at Krušedol monastery.

He wrote to Vučić in 1853 to say that he did not want to recover the throne by violence. The prince later moved to Vienna, where he lived with his father in Palais Salm, bought by them in 1852. There he managed his father&#x27;s large estate. At that time, he wrote the poem &quot;&quot;Što se bore misli moje&quot; (&quot;&quot;Why do my thoughts torture me&quot;). It was dedicated to his first love, Princess Maria Josefa von und zu Liechtenstein (1835-1905), the youngest daughter of Prince Karl Joseph of Liechtenstein (1790-1865) and his wife, Countess Franziska von Würben und Freudenthal (1799-1863). He asked for her hand, but her father initially declined, as Mihailo was an Orthodox and she was a staunch Catholic. Furthermore, Karl Joseph thought that Maria Josefa was a too good catch for a deposed Prince, member of the House of Obrenovic, an upstart vassal dynasty whose wealth came from trading. At the time, Obrenović family were living in exile, while Serbia has been ruled by the rival Karadjordjevic dynasty. After being rejected and insulted, Mihailo, broke all social contacts with this line of the Liechtenstein family, who were also living in Vienna. Princess Maria Josepha later married Prince Ferdinand Bonaventura Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1834-1904) and is ancestor of many royals, including the ruling Prince Hans Adam II of Liechtenstein.

On 1 August 1853, Mihailo married Countess Júlia Hunyady de Kéthely (26 August 1831 – 19 February 1919) in the Russian chapel in Vienna. She was the youngest child and only daughter of Count Ferenc Hunyady de Kéthely (1804–1882) by his wife, Countess Julia Zichy de Zich et Vásonkeő (1808–1873). The marriage proved to be unhappy and childless, although Mihailo had one illegitimate child, a son Velimir Mihailo Teodorović by his former Styrian mistress Maria Berghaus (1831-1863). While living in exile, he spoke French and German fluently.

==Second reign and assassination==

Mihailo was accepted back as Prince of Serbia after 18 years in exile, in September 1860, after the death of his father who had regained the throne in 1858. For the next eight years, he ruled as an enlightened monarch. 
Mihailo sought to reduce the authority and immunity of Serbian senators. During his second reign, the People&#x27;s Assembly was convened just three times. 

Prince Mihailo&#x27;s greatest achievement was achieving a complete withdrawal of Turkish troops from Serbia in 1862. The Turkish presence had previously been restricted to a few fortresses and a designated neighborhood in Belgrade. Serbians were eventually allowed into the Turkish neighborhood with altercations sometimes reaching the point of major disturbances. After one such riot in the wake of the Čukur Fountain incident in June, 1862, which threatened the Turkish Belgrade Fortress, the Turks responded by bombarding the city. A Turkish inquiry ensued and the Great Powers which had allowed a Turkish presence in Serbia during the settlements of the Crimean War, summoned a conference at Constantinople in order to broker a conference between Serbs and Turks. 

On September 4, 1862, the conference reached an agreement in which it was decreed that all Muslim inhabitants should be withdrawn from Serbia with the exceptions of existing garrisons in Belgrade, Fetislam, Šabac, and Smederevo. Prince Michael meanwhile continued to negotiate for all Turkish troops to be withdrawn from the country. Prince Michael wrote a letter to Grand Vizier Mehmed Fuad Pasha, emphasizing the lack of national interest the Ottomans had in maintaining troops in Serbia, and expounding upon the importance that the Serbs placed in the departure of all foreign troops.

The Sultan did not permit complete Serbian independence, but Serbian troops in service of the Ottoman government were permitted to replace Turkish troops at the garrisons, and the Serbian flag was allowed to fly over the fortresses alongside that of the Turkish flag. 

This was not viewed as a sufficient concession by Serbian nationalists and partisans of the Karađorđević dynasty, still viewing the prince with enmity at having displaced their preferred royal family.

In 1866–68, Mihailo forged The First Balkan Alliance by signing the series of agreements with other Balkan entities.

During his rule, the first modern Serbian coins were minted. He was also the first in modern Serbian history to declare Belgrade the official capital city of the country.

Mihailo wished to divorce his wife, Julia, in order to marry his young mistress, Katarina Konstantinović, the daughter of his first cousin, Princess Anka Obrenović. Both resided at the royal court at his invitation. His plans for a divorce and subsequent remarriage to Katarina met with much protest from politicians, clergy and the general public. His astute and gifted Prime Minister Ilija Garašanin was dismissed from his post in 1867 for daring to voice his opposition to the divorce. However, the actual divorce never took place.

While Prince Mihailo Obrenović was gradually introducing absolutism, a conspiracy was formed against him. The main organizers and perpetrators were the brothers Radovanović, who wanted to avenge their brother, Ljubomir Radovanović, who was in prison. Kosta Radovanović, the main perpetrator, was a wealthy and respected merchant. His brother, Pavle Radovanović, was with him during the assassination, and the third of the brothers, Đorđe Radovanović, was also involved. Prince Mihailo Obrenović was also member of the masonic lodge.

On 10 June 1868 Mihailo was travelling with Katarina and Princess Anka in a carriage through the park of Košutnjak near his country residence on the outskirts of Belgrade.
In the park appeared Pavle and Kosta Radovanović in formal black suits, and pointing a loaded gun at the Prince, Kosta approached the carriage. Prince Mihailo Obrenović recognized him, because of a dispute over his brother Ljubomir. The last words of the prince, which Kosta himself admitted when on trial, were: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s true.&quot; Mihailo and Anka were shot dead, and Katarina wounded. Further details of the plot behind the assassination have never been clarified; the sympathizers and cousins of the Karađorđević dynasty were suspected of being behind the crime, but this has not been proven. The National Assembly declared the House of Karađorđević perpetually excluded from ruling and proclaimed Prince Michael&#x27;s fourteen year old cousin Milan as the legitimate heir to the Serbian throne. 

Anka&#x27;s granddaughter Natalija Konstantinović was married in 1902 to the Montenegrin Prince Mirko Petrović-Njegoš (1879–1918), whose sister Zorka had previously married Prince Petar Karađorđević in 1883, who later became King of Serbia. Natalija&#x27;s granddaughter is Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, a French stylist.

Prince Mihailo was awarded Order of Prince Danilo I, Order of the White Eagle (Russian Empire), Order of Saint Anna, Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky, Order of the Redeemer, Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, Order of the Medjidie, Order of Glory (Ottoman Empire) and Order of Leopold (Austria).

<text>The National Soccer League was a soccer league in Canada that existed from 1926 to 1997. Teams were primarily based in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The league was renamed to Canadian National Soccer League in 1993 following the folding of the Canadian Soccer League, and the accepting of the Winnipeg Fury, making the league more national. In the 1960s, the Canadian National Soccer League was one of four major leagues in Canadian soccer alongside the Pacific Coast League, the Eastern Canada Professional Soccer League and the Western Canada Soccer League.

It was replaced by the Canadian Professional Soccer League in 1998, after an agreement between the CNSL and the Ontario Soccer Association.

<text>This is a list of aviation-related events from 1940:

== Events ==
* The Consolidated Aircraft Corporation absorbs the Hall Aluminum Aircraft Corporation.
* Transcontinental and Western Air inaugurates the world&#x27;s first in-flight audio entertainment for airline passengers, who have individual receivers with which to listen to commercial radio broadcasts.

===January===
* The Soviets use observation balloons to pinpoint the locations of Finnish artillery emplacements and bunkers during the month, which is a static period of the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland. The Soviet Air Force engages in almost continuous bombardment of Finnish ground positions.
* The German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s chief of intelligence, Colonel Josef &quot;Beppo&quot; Schmid, reports that the British Royal Air Force and French Air Force are &quot;clearly inferior in strength and armament in comparison to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;,&quot; that even an entry into World War II by the United States would not alone improve the status of Allied air power during 1940, and that British fighters stood little chance in combat with the German Messerschmitt Bf 110 twin-engine fighter.
* January 6 – Finnish Air Force Lieutenant Jorma Sarvanto shoots down six Soviet Ilyushin DB-3 bombers out of a formation of seven in four minutes.
* January 10 – A German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Messerschmitt Bf 108 &quot;Taifun&quot; liaison aircraft carrying a copy of Case Yellow, the German plan for a proposed attack on neutral Belgium and the Netherlands, strays off course into Belgium and crash-lands near Mechelen-sur-Meuse. The Belgians communicate the plans to the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom, although the resulting international crisis soon dies down.
* January 19 – The first flight from Dublin Airport in the Republic of Ireland takes place. The flight is to Liverpool, England.

===February===
* February 1 – The Soviets begin a new ground offensive in Finland, supported by about 500 bombers.
* February 28 – Germany begins the scrapping of the second &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;-class aircraft carrier, &quot;Flugzeugträger B&quot;, while she still is incomplete on the building ways. Scrapping is completed four months later.
* February 29
**An attack by 40 Polikarpov I-153 and Polikarpov I-16 fighters on the Finnish Air Force airfield at Ruokalahti is the most successful Soviet Air Force strike of the Winter War. Surprising the Finns on the ground, the Soviets shoot down three Gloster Gladiators as they try to get airborne and shoot down two more Gladiators and a Fokker D.XXI in an ensuring dogfight, losing only one I-16 in exchange.
**The Finnish government asks the United Kingdom and France to send 100 bombers with crews and bombs to Finland at once to assist in the war with the Soviet Union.

===March===
* The United States begins construction of a U.S. Navy seaplane base at Midway Atoll.
* March 2 – The United Kingdom and France promise to send 100 bombers with crews and bombs to assist Finland at once, but do not follow through on the promise.
* March 6 – France informs the Finnish government that it will dispatch an expeditionary force including 72 bombers to Finland on March 13, but the Winter War ends before the French force can begin its journey.
* March 13 – The Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland ends in the defeat of Finland. During the 3-month war, the Finnish Air Force has grown from 96 to 287 aircraft, and has lost 62 aircraft in air-to-air combat and 59 more damaged beyond repair, while the Soviet Union has lost between 700 and 900 – 725 confirmed destroyed and about 200 unconfirmed – of the 2,500 to 3,000 aircraft it has committed to the campaign, and another 300 damaged. The Soviet Air Force has dropped 150,000 bombs – about 7,500 tons (6,803 tonnes/metric tons) of bombs – on Finnish territory, but has performed poorly; its operations in early December 1939 had failed to disrupt Finnish mobilization and, despite unusually clear weather in January and February, it failed to disrupt the lone railroad connecting Finland with the outside world for more than a few hours at a time or to disrupt Finnish merchant shipping, despite 60 air raids on Finnish ports.
* March 16 – The United Kingdom suffers its first civilian air-raid casualties of World War II during a raid by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 26 on Scapa Flow.
* March 19–20 (overnight) – Royal Air Force Bomber Command conducts its first attack of World War II against a land target, when 20 Hampdens and 30 Whitleys strike the German seaplane base at Hörnum on the island of Sylt. One Whitley is lost.
* March 25 – The United States Government grants permission to American aircraft manufacturers to sell advanced combat aircraft to countries fighting the Axis powers.

===April===
* For the second time, U.S. Army Air Corps bombers from Oahu bomb lava tubes to try to prevent lava from an eruption of Mauna Loa from reaching Hilo in the Territory of Hawaii. The bombing fails, although the lava stops naturally before reaching Hilo.
* April 9 – Germany invades Denmark and Norway, making extensive use of paratroops. RAF Bomber Command is ordered to halt the German advance through southern Norway; the missions require round trips, almost entirely over the North Sea.
* April 10
** German Dornier Do 17s and Heinkel He 111s attack British towns and shore facilities in the Scapa Flow area in the Orkney Islands. Defending Gloster Sea Gladiators of the Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s No. 804 Squadron shoot down one He 111.
** Sixteen Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skua dive bombers sink the German light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; at Bergen, Norway. It is the first time in history that dive bombers sink a major warship. One Skua is lost.
* April 11 – The first aerial torpedo attack of World War II and the first coordinated torpedo attack launched from an aircraft carrier in history takes place, as Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers from the British aircraft carrier attack two German destroyers in Trondheimsfjord, Norway. The torpedoes all ground in the shallows and no hits are achieved; three aircraft are lost.
* April 12 – RAF Bomber Command loses six Hampdens and three Wellingtons in a daylight raid against German forces at Stavanger, Norway. It is the last daylight raid by the two types of aircraft in northwestern Europe.
* April 13 – During the Second Battle of Narvik, a Swordfish floatplane from the British battleship sinks the German submarine &quot;U-64&quot; in Herjangsfjorden off Bjerkvik, Norway, the first time that a Royal Navy aircraft sinks an enemy submarine during World War II. The Swordfish spots gunfire for &quot;Warspite&quot; and ships accompanying her in Ofotfjord, resulting in the destruction of seven German destroyers, and finishes off one of the destroyers with a bombing attack.
* April 13–14 (overnight) – The Royal Air Force begins deploying sea mines in Germany″s coastal waters.
* April 24 – The British aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; flies off the Gloster Gladiators of the Royal Air Force″s No. 263 Squadron for service ashore in Norway. The Gladiators then operate from a landing strip on Lesjaskogsvatnet, a lake near Åndalsnes.
* April 25 – &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; Hermann Förster becomes the first German night fighter pilot to shoot down a British bomber during World War II. Flying a Messerschmitt Bf 109D-1, he downs a Handley Page Hampden laying naval mines off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein.
* April 25 – Swordfish and Skuas from the British aircraft carriers HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; raid targets in the Trondheim area in Norway.
* April 28 – Aircraft from HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; raid the Trondheim area, causing considerable damage to the German-held airfield at Vaernes, Norway.

===May===
* The Imperial Japanese Navy″s air arm begins Operation 101, the largest aerial offensive of the Second Sino-Japanese War to date, seeking to destroy Nationalist Chinese air capabilities in Sichuan province and military facilities around Chongqing. It continues until the end of the summer, and will involve 3,715 sorties in 182 raids and the dropping of over 2,000 tons (1,814,388 kg) of bombs.
* Germany suspends construction of the aircraft carrier &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. It will not resume until May 1942.
* Helen Richey obtains a flight instructor″s certificate and begins training United States Army Air Corps cadets – the only woman to do so – at Pittsburgh-Butler Airport in Butler, Pennsylvania.
* May 1 – German aircraft attack the British aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; off Norway. Her embarked Gloster Sea Gladiators defend her.
* May 5 – The British aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; begins a week and a half of support to Allied forces in the Narvik area of Norway.
* May 10 – Germany invades France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Paratroops again play a key role. German aircraft surprise aircraft of the Royal Air Force″s Advanced Air Striking Force on the ground, but inflict only light damage. Thirty-three Blenheims attack German transport aircraft and other targets in the Netherlands, losing three aircraft. At noon, 32 Fairey Battles attack German ground forces in Luxembourg, losing 13 aircraft shot down and the rest damaged; a second raid by 32 Battles sees the loss of 10 more aircraft. During the day, the Dutch Air Force loses about half its aircraft and the Belgian Air Force about a quarter of its planes, a combined total of more than 100 planes; France loses four of its 879 combat-ready planes destroyed on the ground and 30 damaged, while the Royal Air Force loses six planes destroyed and 12 put out of action out of 384 deployed in France. Dutch and Belgian aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shoot down 230 German planes including most of Germany″s transport aircraft, and Germany loses 44 more aircraft to French and British forces over France. The Germans are the first to use military gliders in action in the Battle of Fort Eben-Emael when 41 DFS 230 gliders each carrying ten soldiers are launched behind Junkers Ju 52s. Ten gliders land on the grassed roof of the fortress. Only twenty minutes after landing the force has neutralized the fortress at a cost of six dead and twenty wounded.
* May 11–12 (overnight) – British bombers interdict German Army troop movement as 37 Handley Page Hampdens and Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys bomb road and rail junctions near Mönchengladbach. Three British bombers are lost.
* May 13 – The Sikorsky VS-300, which made its first flight the previous year, makes its first untethered flight.
* May 14
**The Allies lose 110 aircraft – 70 British Fairey Battles and Bristol Blenheims and forty French planes – on one day in a disastrous attempt to bomb bridges over the River Meuse.
**Fifty-three German Heinkel He 111 bombers drop nearly 100 tons of bombs on Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The attack kills nearly 1,000 people, destroys 20,000 buildings, and leaves 78,000 people homeless.
* May 15 – During British evacuation and demolition operations in Dutch ports, German dive bombers attack the British destroyer , which is beached and wrecked at the mouth of the Scheldt.
* May 15–16 (overnight) – RAF Bomber Command conducts its first strategic bombing raid of World War II, as 99 Hampden, Whitley, and Vickers Wellington bombers strike German targets in the Ruhr Valley. One British bomber is lost.

<doc id="565903" wikidata="Q1068465" url="?curid=565903" title="Chautauqua Lake">
<text>Chautauqua Lake is located entirely within Chautauqua County, New York, United States. The lake is approximately long and wide at its greatest width. The surface area is approximately . The maximum depth is about . The shoreline is about of which all but are privately owned.

The lake&#x27;s name comes from the now-extinct Erie language. Because the Erie people were defeated in the Beaver Wars before a comprehensive study of their language could be made, its meaning remains unknown and a source of speculation, with two longstanding folk translations being “bag tied in the middle” and “place where fish are taken out,” the latter having some support based on similar words in other Iroquoian languages. A Seneca legend, dating at least to the days of Seneca diplomat John Cornplanter Abeel, attests to the Chautauqua having a reputation as a &quot;place of easy death.&quot;

==Geography==
While the lake has a similar geologic structure (a very long, narrow valley) to the Finger Lakes in the east, it is not considered one of the Finger Lakes. Chautauqua Lake runs perpendicular to the westernmost of those lakes (much like an opposable thumb), lies in a different watershed, and was likely formed by a different process.

Chautauqua Lake, at an elevation of above sea level, is higher than any of the Finger Lakes. It is also one of the highest navigable lakes in North America. The lake&#x27;s water level is regulated by Warner Dam, with the water level lifted during the summer to allow for recreational boat use and lowered during the winter months.

The water from the lake drains to the south, emptying first into the Chadakoin River in Jamestown, New York, before traveling east into Cassadaga Creek and Conewango Creek, south into the Allegheny River in Warren, Pennsylvania, and the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, instead of moving north into the Great Lakes. Chautauqua Creek and Little Chautauqua Creek have their headwaters near the lake, but flow north into lake Erie. The drainage divide was spanned by Pierre-Joseph Céloron de Blainville in his 1749 Ohio River expedition that started from Montreal, and the town of Celoron at the southern end of the lake is named for him. The lake&#x27;s drainage area is about .

Also at the southern end of the lake is the City of Jamestown while the Village of Mayville is located at the northern end. Other communities located on the lake are Bemus Point, Maple Springs, Lakewood and Chautauqua, the site of the influential Chautauqua Institution founded in 1874. There are many other settlements located on the lake, including Fluvanna, Greenhurst, Dewittville, Stow, and Ashville Bay.

===Civil division===
As of February 19, 2008, Chautauqua Lake has the unique distinction of being an unorganized territory within Chautauqua County. Unlike most large bodies of water in New York which are administratively divided up among the surrounding towns, villages, and cities, Chautauqua Lake is demarcated by the USGS and U.S. Census Bureau as a nonfunctioning political division of its own.

==Tourism and recreation==

The lake is used primarily for recreation, such as boating and fishing, and tourism. The majority of tourists flock to the Chautauqua Institution, which contains a wide variety of stores and restaurants and is home to live music entertainment and many public lectures during the summer months. Chautauqua Lake is known for its muskellunge fishing and sailing. There are two very popular boating locations on the lake, &quot;Sandy Bottoms&quot; (aka &quot;The Sand Bar&quot;) in the northernmost part of the lake, and &quot;Party Bay,&quot; located to the east/southeast of Long Point State Park, near Maple Springs. On busy, warm weekends, it is not uncommon to see nearly 100 boats in this area of the lake. Every Fourth of July, fireworks are launched from communities around the lake.

There is one bridge that connects the opposite sides of the lake, the Veterans Memorial Bridge (also known as the Chautauqua Lake Bridge). The structure was completed on October 30, 1982, and joins Bemus Point to Stow on I-86 (at the time known as Route 17). Prior to the construction of the bridge, the only means for cars to cross the lake was the Bemus Point–Stow ferry, a nine-car cable guided ferry, which still operates during the summer months and has become more of a tourist attraction. The cost of the ferry ride is free, though donations are accepted, and it is operated by the Sea Lion Project Ltd.

The lake is the home of the &quot;Chautauqua Belle&quot;, a replica sternwheeler steamboat constructed in 1975 for the US Bicentennial, which offers sightseeing cruises on the lake.

The Village of Bemus Point has several popular attractions on the lake during the summer months. Prior to 2018, a popular tourist location was the Bemus Point restaurant, The Italian Fisherman, since renamed &quot;The Fish.&quot; Prior to its change in name and ownership, the Italian Fisherman boasted a popular floating stage that hosted an annual summertime concert series. As of 2020 plans were underway to move the floating stage series to Mayville. Bemus Point offers The Village Casino, a restaurant and bar that can easily be reached by boat. Boaters are able to tie up at the Casino&#x27;s dock where waitresses will serve them from their location. This establishment also has historical value in the area and offers nightlife on the lake. Contrary to its name, the Casino does not offer gambling.

From the late 1990s until September 2018, visitors could schedule a lake tour or dinner cruise on &quot;The Summer Wind,&quot; a large leisure boat that departed from Celoron at the southern end of the lake. The Summer Wind was damaged in a storm in 2019 and missed the 2020 tourist season. &quot;The Summer Wind&quot; was sold in late 2021 and moved out of Chautauqua County.

Two yacht clubs are located at the lake, Chautauqua Lake Yacht Club in Lakewood and Chautauqua Yacht Club in Chautauqua.

Chautauqua Lake supports a diverse sportfishery, with angling for walleye, muskellunge, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and several species of panfish. Additional species include yellow perch, pumpkinseed, bluegill, black crappie, white crappie, white perch, white bass, brown bullhead, yellow bullhead, white sucker, common carp, rock bass, longnose gar and golden shiner.

==In popular culture==
Chautauqua Lake is mentioned in at least one episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Lucille Ball (a native of nearby Celoron, New York), playing the role of Lucy Ricardo, finds a stuffed and mounted fish in a trunk in her attic and recalls that Ricky caught it at Chautauqua Lake, and was so thrilled that he had mounted and kept it.

Chautauqua Lake is of major significance in the novel &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; by Stewart O&#x27;Nan, published in 2002. The German translation of the title was &quot;Abschied von Chautauqua&quot;, which means &quot;A Farewell from Chautauqua&quot;.

It is also the origin and namesake of the Chautauqua adult education movement, which was heavily referenced in the novel &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; by Robert M. Pirsig.

<doc id="565905" wikidata="Q106103952" url="?curid=565905" title="Disassortative mating">
<text>Disassortative mating (also known as negative assortative mating or heterogamy) is a mating pattern in which individuals with dissimilar phenotypes mate with one another more frequently than would be expected under random mating. Disassortative mating reduces the mean genetic similarities within the population and produces a greater number of heterozygotes. The pattern is character specific, but does not affect allele frequencies. This nonrandom mating pattern will result in deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg principle (which states that genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of other evolutionary influences, such as &quot;mate choice&quot; in this case).

Disassortative mating is different from outbreeding, which refers to mating patterns in relation to genotypes rather than phenotypes.

Due to homotypic preference (bias toward the same type), assortative mating occurs more frequently than disassortative mating. This is because homotypic preferences increase relatedness between mates and between parents and offspring that would promote cooperation and increases inclusive fitness. With disassortative mating, heterotypic preference (bias towards different types) in many cases has been shown to increase overall fitness. When this preference is favored, it allows a population to generate and/or maintain polymorphism (genetic variation within a population).

The fitness advantage aspect of disassortative mating seems straightforward, but the evolution of selective forces involved in disassortative mating are still largely unknown in natural populations.

== Types of disassortative mating ==
Imprinting is one example of disassortative mating. A model shows that individuals imprint on a genetically transmitted trait during early ontogeny and choosy females later use those parental images as a basis of mate choice. A viability-reducing trait may be maintained even without the fertility cost of same-type matings. With imprinting, preference can be established even if it is initially rare, when there is a fertility cost of same-type matings.

One uncommon type of disassortative mating is the female preference on rare (or novel) male phenotypes. A study on guppies, &quot;Poecilia reticulata&quot;, revealed that the female preference was sufficient to tightly maintain polymorphism in male traits. This type of mate choice shows that costly preferences can persist at higher frequencies if mate choice is hindered, which would allow the alleles to approach fixation.

== Effects ==
Disassortative mating may result in balancing selection and the maintenance of high genetic variation in the population. This is due to the excess heterozygotes that are produced from disassortative mating relative to a randomly mating population.

== In humans ==
The best-known example of disassortative mating in humans is preference for genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6. Individuals feel more attracted to odors of individuals who are genetically different in this region. This promotes MHC heterozygosity in the children, making them less vulnerable to pathogens.

== In non-human species ==
Evidence from research regarding coloration in &quot;Heliconius&quot; butterflies suggests that disassortative mating is more likely to emerge when phenotypic variation is based on self-referencing (mate preference depends on phenotype of the choosing individual, therefore dominance in relationships influence the evolution of disassortative mating).

Disassortative mating has been found with traits such as body symmetry in &quot;Amphridromus&quot; inversus snails. Normally in snails, rarely are individuals of the opposite coil able to mate with individuals of a normal coil pattern. However, it has been discovered that this species of snail frequents mating between individuals of opposing coils. It is said that the chirality of the spermatophore and the females reproductive tract have a greater chance of producing offspring. This example of disassortative mating promotes polymorphism within the population.

In the scale eating predator fish, &quot;Perissodus microlepis&quot;, disassortative mating allows the individuals with the rare phenotype of mouth-opening direction to have better success as predators.

House mice conduct disassortative mating as they prefer mates genetically dissimilar to themselves. Specifically, odor profiles in mice are strongly linked to genotypes at the MHC loci controlling changes in the immune response. When MHC-heterozygous offspring are produced, it enhances their immunocompetence because of their ability to recognize a large range of pathogens. Thus, the mice tend to prefer providing &quot;good genes&quot; to their offspring so they will mate with individuals with differences at the MHC loci.

In the seaweed fly, &quot;Coelopa frigida&quot;, heterozygotes at the locus alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) have been shown to express better fitness by having higher larval density and relative viability. Females displayed disassortative mating in respect to the Adh locus because they would only mate with males of the opposite Adh genotype. It is suspected that they do this to maintain genetic variation in the population. 

White-throated sparrows, &quot;Zonotrichia albicollis&quot;, prefer strong disassortative mating behaviors regarding the color of their head stripe. The single locus that controls this expression is only observed in heterozygotes. Additionally, the heterozygote arrangement of chromosome 2 from disassortative mating produced offspring of high aggression which is shown to be a social behavior that allows them to dominate their opponents.

<text>Sir Andreas Whittam Smith, (born 13 June 1937) is an English financial journalist, who was one of the founders of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper, which began publication in October 1986 with Whittam Smith as editor. He is a former president of the British Board of Film Classification.

==Early life and education==
Whittam Smith was born in Macclesfield, son of Rev. Canon J. E. Smith, a vicar at Macclesfield; the family moved to Birkenhead in 1940 when his father took over a dockland parish. J. E. Smith was from a working-class family from Manchester, going from there to St John&#x27;s College, Durham; his wife was daughter of a mill owner. Smith was educated at Birkenhead School, and Keble College, Oxford.

==Career==
Most of his career has been spent in the city in journalism, including as city editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; and as editor of the &quot;Investors Chronicle&quot; from 1970 to 1977, and &quot;Stock Exchange Gazette&quot;. With Matthew Symonds, he was a co-founder of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper and was its first editor from 1986 to 1993. He still contributes articles on a regular basis.

Whittam Smith was chairman of the Financial Ombudsman Service from 2001 to 2003. He is also a director of Independent News and Media (UK), Vice Chairman of Tunbridge Wells Equitable Friendly Society, and a vice-president of the National Council for One Parent Families. He was appointed president of the British Board of Film Classification in 1998, instigating liberalisation of film and video censorship, a post from which he resigned in 2002. He has been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation.

Whittam Smith was interviewed by National Life Stories (C467/08) in 2007 for the &#x27;Oral History of the British Press&#x27; collection held by the British Library.

===Church of England===
On 6 March 2002, Whittam Smith was appointed the First Church Estates Commissioner, a senior lay person in the Church of England. As such, he is Chairman of the Church Commissioners&#x27; Assets Committee (an investment portfolio of £7 billion), and a member of the Church Commissioners&#x27; Board of Governors, the General Synod of the Church of England, and the Archbishops&#x27; Council. It was announced in September 2016 that he would be stepping down as First Church Estates Commissioner in June 2017.

==Democracy 2015==
In 2012 Whittam Smith started the Democracy 2015 movement to attempt to reform how British democracy functions. The movement&#x27;s stated aim was to achieve a House of Commons majority in 2015 and form a reformist government independent of parliamentary parties and composed of non-politicians volunteering to stand for a single term only. The movement said that politics should be public service, not a career move. The movement stood a candidate, Adam Lotun, in the Corby by-election on 15 November 2012. He came 13th out of 14 candidates, with 35 votes.

==Honours==
In 1988 Whittam Smith was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D) by the University of Bath.

In the 2003 New Year Honours, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) &quot;for services to the Film Industry.&quot; In the 2015 Birthday Honours, he was knighted &quot;for public service, particularly to the Church of England&quot;, and therefore granted the title &quot;Sir&quot;.

In July 2017, he was awarded the Canterbury Cross for Services to the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.

<text>Laurie Donald Thomas Ferguson (born 7 July 1952) is a former Australian politician who was an Australian Labor Party member of the House of Representatives from March 1990, representing Reid until 2010 and Werriwa until May 2016, both in New South Wales.

==Early life and education==
Laurie Ferguson grew up in Guildford, the eldest son of Mary Ellen and Jack Ferguson, who was deputy premier of New South Wales 1976–84. His brother Martin was also a federal MP. Both attended at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Strathfield. His younger brother, Andrew, was the former NSW Secretary of the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (Construction and General Division).

Ferguson was educated at the University of Sydney and was a research officer with the Federated Miscellaneous Workers&#x27; Union before entering politics.

==Career==
He was the member for Granville in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly 1984–90.

In the federal Parliament, Ferguson was elected to the opposition shadow ministry in March 1996 and was Shadow Minister for Immigration in 2004–05. His handling of the debate around Petro Georgiou&#x27;s private member&#x27;s bill on asylum seekers was severely criticised and he was shifted to Shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs, Population Health and Health Regulation in June 2005. On the election of the Rudd Labor Government in 2007, Ferguson became Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs and Settlement Services.

He was preselected to contest the south-western Sydney seat of Werriwa at the 2010 federal election after his existing seat of Reid was merged with neighbouring Lowe. Lowe MP John Murphy contested the redistributed Reid. He was not re-appointed to the Gillard Ministry after the election. Ferguson is a member of the Board of Advisors of the Global Panel Foundation-Australasia.

==Personal life==
Ferguson is married to Maureen Walsh, a former councillor at Parramatta City Council in the Woodville Ward.

<doc id="565915" wikidata="Q16242256" url="?curid=565915" title="Heath bar">
<text>The Heath bar is a candy bar made of toffee, almonds, and milk chocolate, first manufactured by the Heath Brothers Confectionery in 1928. The Heath bar has been manufactured and distributed by Hershey since its acquisition of the Leaf International North American confectionery operations late in 1996.

==History==
In 1913, school teacher L. S. Heath bought a confectionery shop in Robinson, Illinois, as a likely business opportunity for his oldest sons, Bayard and Everett. In 1914, the brothers opened a combined candy store, ice cream parlor, and manufacturing operation there.

With the success of the business, the elder Heath became interested in manufacturing ice cream and opened a small dairy factory in 1915. His sons worked on expanding their confectionery business. At some point, they reportedly acquired a toffee recipe, via a traveling salesman, from Vriner&#x27;s Greek confectionery in Champaign. In 1928, they began marketing the toffee confection locally as &quot;Heath English Toffee&quot;, proclaiming it &quot;America&#x27;s Finest&quot;.

In 1931, Bayard and Everett were persuaded by their father to sell their confectionery shop and work at his dairy. They brought their candy-making equipment with them and established a retail business there. The Heaths came up with the marketing idea of including their toffee confection on the dairy products order form taken around by the Heath dairy trucks: customers could then order Heath bars to be delivered along with milk and cottage cheese.

Early ads promoted Heath as a virtual health baronly the best milk chocolate and almonds, creamery butter, and &quot;pure sugar cane&quot;. The motto at the bottom of one ad read &quot;Heath for better health!&quot; The motto was surrounded by illustrations of milk, cream, butter, cheese, and ice cream and in a cornera Heath bar and a bottle of soda. The soda may have been Pepsi, as the Heath Co. bottled the drink for a number of years.

The Heath bar grew in national popularity during the Depression, despite its size and the 5-cent price, equal to larger bars.

In 1940, family members invested in one of the few available oil leases near Newton, Illinois, that had been overlooked by major oil companies. In July 1940, the lease struck oil, eventually pumping 2,700 barrels per day and earning over $1 million for the family. Two years later in 1942, the U.S. Army placed an order for $175,000 of Heath Bars to be included in soldiers&#x27; rations. The size of this order led the family to modernize the plant equipment; the candy was manufactured consistently on a major commercial scale thereafter.

Popularity of the Heath bar grew after the war; in 1946, L.S. Heath, his four sons, two daughters and grandchildren incorporated L.S. Heath &amp; Sons, Inc. The manufacturing process remained largely a hands-on, family-run operation. In the 1950s, the Heath Toffee Ice Cream Bar was developed and was eventually franchised to other dairies. By 1955, the operation had grown to produce about 69,000 candy bar centers at one time. The automatic wrapping machines turned out 1,600 candy bars per minute. The company had 35 candy salesmen who called on approximately 7,200 wholesale distributors in the United States along with thousands of other outlets, such as theaters, vending machine operators, super-markets and chain stores.

In the 1960s, the huge national success of the Heath bar led to disagreements within the family, with at least one grandchild, Richard J. Heath, expelled from the business in 1969. He eventually published a book in 1995 entitled &quot;Bittersweet: The Story of the Heath Candy Co.&quot;

In the 1970s, the company bought the registered trademark Butter Brickle toffee ice cream flavoring formula from The Fenn Bros. Ice Cream and Candy Co. of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

In January 1986, the L.S. Heath &amp; Sons, Inc., filed a trademark application for the Heath name, with a first use declaration of March 1, 1931, which was the year that Bayard and Everett Heath sold the confectionery business and began working in the dairy operation. The registered trademark Number 1404302 was granted on August 5, 1986.

In 1989, the L.S. Heath &amp; Sons business was sold to Leaf, Inc., which itself had been purchased by Huhtamäki Oyj of Helsinki, Finland, in 1983.

In 1996, the North American confectionery operations of Leaf, Inc., were purchased by The Hershey Company for $440 million plus annual royalties for licenses paid to Huhtamäki Oyj to produce such brands as Heath, Jolly Rancher, Milk Duds, Payday, Whoppers, Chuckles, and Twizzler&#x27;s licorice. In turn, Huhtamäki bought the European confectionery operations of German praline manufacturer Gubor and Italian confectioner Sperlari from Hershey for $110 million.

In April 2018, a holding company named Iconic IP Interests, LLC, an investment vehicle of Highlander Partners, purchased the intellectual property, including trademarks and associated licensing agreements and royalty arrangements of ten candy brands including Heath, Jolly Rancher, PayDay, Good &amp; Plenty, Whoppers, Chuckles, and Milk Duds from Huhtamäki Oyj.

Hershey had previously created the Skor bar in 1981 to compete with the Heath bar, before buying out Leaf, Inc. It currently maintains production and marketing of both the Heath bar and the Skor bar, despite the two being almost identical.

==Product==
Shaped as a thin, hard slab with a milk chocolate coating, the toffee originally contained sugar, butter, and almonds in a small squarish bar weighing .

Since acquiring the product, Hershey has elongated the bar to align with its competition. It now weighs . Current ingredients are milk chocolate, sugar, vegetable oil, dairy butter (milk), almonds, salt, and soy lecithin. The wrapper&#x27;s vintage brown color scheme has a small seal proclaiming Heath the &quot;Finest Quality English Toffee&quot;.

==Heath bars in other products==
Following the 1973 use of the candy bar as an ice-cream &quot;mix-in&quot; by Steve&#x27;s Ice Cream, Heath bars became a significant ingredient in ice cream and other confections.

According to Ray Broekel in his 1982 book &quot;The Great American Candy Bar Book&quot;, variations of the bar have included Heath Milk Chocolate with Peanuts, Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Crunch, Heath Milk Chocolate with Natural Cereal and Raisins and the Double Heath bar. In the 1980s, a Heath Toffee Ice Cream Sandwich appeared, along with Heath Soft &#x27;n Crunchy—a soft-serve ice cream.

Currently, other varieties of Heath bar-based confections include Archway Cookies&#x27; &quot;Heath Cookie&quot;, &quot;Heath Bar&quot; Klondike bars, Baskin-Robbins&#x27; &quot;Heath Bar Shake&quot;, Dairy Queen&#x27;s &quot;Heath Bar Blizzard&quot; and Heath Bar flavored varieties of ice cream with a coffee or vanilla ice cream base. Ben and Jerry&#x27;s produced a &quot;Heath Bar Crunch&quot; ice cream, which was renamed Vanilla Toffee Bar Crunch in 2014 when the company stopped using actual branded Heath bars.

Although the candy bar&#x27;s original manufacturer, L. S. Heath, and subsequently Hershey have supported the incorporation of the candy bar into other confections by marketing a pre-shredded variety, many vendors hand-crumble the candy bars, finding the pre-crumbled variety to be &quot;too small and too dusty&quot;.

==Related products from other manufacturers==

In the 1950s, Marabou in Sweden wanted to have a license to make the Heath bar, but was not allowed to do so. Instead, Marabou took the Heath bar as inspiration and created the Daim bar, which was available in many countries as of 2014.

<text>Civilisation—in full, Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark—is a 1969 British television documentary series written and presented by the art historian Kenneth Clark.

The thirteen programmes in the series outline the history of Western art, architecture and philosophy since the Dark Ages. The series was produced by the BBC and aired from February to May 1969 on BBC2. Then, and in later transmissions in Britain, the US and other countries it reached an unprecedented number of viewers for an art series. Clark&#x27;s book of the same title, based on the series, was published in 1969. Its production standards were generally praised and set the pattern for subsequent television documentary series. The &quot;New Yorker&quot; magazine described it as revelatory for the general viewer.

The BBC&#x27;s DVD issue in 2005 has remained in the catalogues, and Clark&#x27;s accompanying 1969 book has never been out of print.

== Background ==
Clark had pioneered British television series about art, beginning in 1958, with &quot;Is Art Necessary?&quot;, an experimental series for Associated Television, a commercial broadcaster. Over the next eight years Clark wrote and presented series and one-off programmes on the visual arts, ranging from Caravaggio to Bruegel the Elder, Rembrandt, Goya, Van Gogh and Picasso, and a co-production for commercial television and the BBC, &quot;Royal Palaces&quot;.

In 1966 David Attenborough, the controller of the BBC&#x27;s new second television channel, BBC2, was in charge of introducing colour broadcasting to the UK, He conceived the idea of a series about great paintings as the standard-bearer for colour television, and had no doubt that Clark would be much the best presenter for it. Clark was attracted by the suggestion, but at first declined to commit himself. He later recalled that what convinced him that he should take part was Attenborough&#x27;s use of the word &quot;civilisation&quot; to sum up what the series would be about.
The series consists of thirteen programmes, each fifty minutes long, written and presented by Clark, covering western European civilisation from the end of the Dark Ages to the early twentieth century. As the civilisation under consideration excludes Graeco-Roman, Asian and other historically important cultures, a title was chosen that disclaimed comprehensiveness: &quot;Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark&quot;. Clark later commented, &quot;I didn&#x27;t suppose that anyone would be so obtuse as to think that I had forgotten about the great civilisations of the pre-Christian era and the East. However, I confess the title has worried me. It would have been easy in the eighteenth century: &quot;Speculations on the Nature of Civilisation as illustrated by the Phases of Civilised Life in Western Europe from the Dark Ages to Present Day&quot;. Unfortunately, this is no longer practicable.&quot; Although the series focused chiefly on the visual arts and architecture, there were substantial sections about drama, literature, music, philosophy and socio-political movements. Clark wanted to include more about law and philosophy, but &quot;I could not think of any way of making them visually interesting.&quot;

After initial mutual antipathy, Clark and his principal director, Michael Gill, established a congenial working relationship. They and their production team spent three years from 1966 filming in a hundred and seventeen locations in thirteen countries. The filming was to the highest technical standards of the day, and quickly went over budget; it cost £500,000 by the time it was complete. Attenborough rejigged his broadcasting schedules to spread the cost, transmitting each episode twice during the thirteen-week run.

==Series outline==
===1. &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;===

In this first episode Clark—travelling from Byzantine Ravenna to the Celtic Hebrides, from the Norway of the Vikings to Charlemagne&#x27;s chapel at Aachen—tells the story of the Dark Ages, the six centuries following the collapse of the Roman Empire, and “how European thought and art were saved by &#x27;the skin of our teeth&#x27;”.

(US broadcast title: &quot;The Frozen World&quot;.)

===2. &quot;The Great Thaw&quot;===

Clark tells of the sudden reawakening of European civilisation in the 12th century. He traces it from its first manifestations in Cluny Abbey to the Basilica of St Denis and finally to its high point, the building of Chartres Cathedral in the early 13th century.

:*The Duke of Berry
:*St Francis of Assisi
:*Civic Life
:*Giotto

===4. &quot;Man: the Measure of all Things&quot;===

Visiting Florence, Clark argues that European thought gained a new impetus from its rediscovery of its classical past in the 15th century. He visits the palaces at Urbino and Mantua and other centres of (Renaissance) civilisation.
:*Early Renaissance
:*Leonardo Bruni
:*David (Donatello)
:*Perspective
:*Leon Battista Alberti
:*Jan van Eyck
:*Botticelli
:*The Palace of Urbino
:*The Court of Mantua
:*A Civilised Countryside.

===5. &quot;The Hero as Artist&quot;===

Here Clark takes the viewer back to 16th century Papal Rome—noting the convergence of Christianity and antiquity. He discusses Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo da Vinci; the courtyards of the Vatican; the rooms decorated for the Pope by Raphael; and the Sistine Chapel.
:*Giants and Heroes
:*The Decadence of the Popes
:*Michelangelo
:*Bound Captives
:*The Sistine Chapel

:*Melancholia
:*Luther
:*The Destruction of Images
:*Michel de Montaigne
:*William Shakespeare.

===7. &quot;Grandeur and Obedience&quot;===

In the Rome of Michelangelo and Bernini, Clark tells of the Catholic Church&#x27;s fight—the Counter-Reformation—against the Protestant north and the Church&#x27;s new splendour symbolised by the glory of St Peter&#x27;s.
:*The Church of Rome
:*The Rome of the Popes
:*St Peter&#x27;s
:*The Catholic Church
:*The Art of Baroque
:*Bernini
:*Baldacchino
:*The Ecstasy of Teresa.

===8. &quot;The Light of Experience&quot;===

Clark tells of new worlds in space and in a drop of water—worlds that the telescope and microscope revealed—and the new realism in the Dutch paintings of Rembrandt and other artists that took the observation of human character to a new stage of development in the 17th century.
:*The Light of Holland
:*Frans Hals
:*Rembrandt
:*Descartes
:*Vermeer
:*The Royal Society
:*Sir Christopher Wren
:*St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

=== 9. &quot;The Pursuit of Happiness&quot; ===

Clark talks of the harmonious flow and complex symmetries of the works of Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart and the reflection of their music in the architecture of the Rococo churches and palaces of Bavaria.
:*French Classicism
:*Johann Sebastian Bach
:*Balthasar Neumann
:*Handel
:*Watteau
:*Haydn
:*Rococo Buildings
:*Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

=== 10. &quot;The Smile of Reason&quot; ===

Clark discusses the Age of Enlightenment, tracing it from the polite conversations of the elegant Parisian salons of the 18th century to subsequent revolutionary politics, the great European palaces of Blenheim and Versailles, and finally Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Monticello.
:*The Enlightenment
:*England
:*The Parisian Salon
:*Chardin
:*Scotland
:*Voltaire
:*Thomas Jefferson
:*George Washington

=== 11. &quot;The Worship of Nature&quot; ===

Belief in the divinity of nature, Clark argues, usurped Christianity&#x27;s position as the chief creative force in Western civilisation and ushered in the Romantic movement. Clark visits Tintern Abbey and the Alps and discusses the landscape paintings of Turner and Constable.
:*The Ruins of Religion
:*Rousseau
:*The Cult of Sensibility
:*Wordsworth
:*Constable
:*Turner
:*The Sky
:*Impressionism.

=== 12. &quot;The Fallacies of Hope&quot; ===

Clark argues that the French Revolution led to the dictatorship of Napoleon and the dreary bureaucracies of the 19th century, and he traces the disillusionment of the artists of Romanticism—from Beethoven&#x27;s music to Byron&#x27;s poetry, Delacroix&#x27;s paintings, and Rodin&#x27;s sculpture.
:*An Escape from Reason
:*The French Revolution
:*Napoleon Bonaparte
:*Beethoven
:*Byron
:*Turner and Gericault
:*Delacroix
:*Rodin.

=== 13. &quot;Heroic Materialism&quot; ===

Clark concludes the series with a discussion of the materialism and humanitarianism of the 19th and 20th centuries. He visits the industrial landscape of 19th century England and the skyscrapers of 20th century New York City. He argues that the achievements of the engineers and scientists—such as Brunel and Rutherford—have been matched by those of the great reformers like Wilberforce and Shaftesbury.
:*The Abolition of Slavery
:*The Industrial Revolution
:*Humanitarianism
:*Isambard Kingdom Brunel
:*Courbet and Millet
:*Tolstoy
:*Our Urge to Destruction
:*God-given Genius.

The series was co-produced by Gill and Peter Montagnon; the cinematographer was Kenneth McMillan; original music was composed by Edwin Astley. Gill directed episodes 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 and 13. Montagnon directed episodes 2, 6, 7, 9, and co-directed episode 11 with Ann Turner, who also directed episode 4.

The series was replayed on BBC Four and released in the Region 2 DVD area in 2005; a Region 1 set followed in 2006. The DVD release included a short interview with David Attenborough about the commissioning and production of the series.

==Reception==
&quot;Civilisation&quot; attracted unprecedented viewing figures for a high art series: 2.5 million viewers in Britain and 5 million in the US. Clark&#x27;s accompanying book has never been out of print, and the BBC issued the series on DVDs which continued to sell thousands of copies every year. In 2016, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; echoed the words of John Betjeman, describing Clark as &quot;the man who made the best telly you’ve ever seen&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s reviewer continued, &quot;Scholars and academics had their understandable quibbles, but for the general public the series was something like a revelation. Art-museum exhibits in both England and the U.S. reported a surge of visitors following each episode.&quot;

There have been complaints in recent times that by focusing on a traditional choice of the great artists over the centuries – all men – Clark had neglected women, and presented &quot;a saga of noble names and sublime objects with little regard for the shaping forces of economics or practical politics&quot;. His &quot;modus operandi&quot; was dubbed &quot;the great man approach&quot;, and he described himself on screen as a hero-worshipper and a stick-in-the-mud. He commented that his outlook was &quot;nothing striking, nothing original, nothing that could not have been written by an ordinary harmless bourgeois of the later nineteenth century&quot;:

The broadcaster Huw Weldon believed that &quot;Civilisation&quot; was &quot;a truly great series, a major work ... the first magnum opus attempted and realised in terms of TV.&quot; There was a widespread view among critics, including some unsympathetic to Clark&#x27;s selections, that the filming set new standards. The series was described as &quot;visually stunning&quot; by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, including Paul B. Harvey in the US and Mary Beard in Britain. In 2011 Jonathan Jones wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; of &quot;Civilisation&#x27;s&quot; &quot;sheer visual beauty ... the camerawork and direction ... rise to the poetry of cinema&quot;.

The British Film Institute notes how &quot;Civilisation&quot; changed the shape of cultural television, setting the standard for later documentary series, from Alastair Cooke&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1972) and Jacob Bronowski&#x27;s &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; (1973) to the present day.

==Sequel==
The BBC announced in 2015 that it was to make a ten-episode sequel to Clark&#x27;s series, to be called &quot;Civilisations&quot; (plural), with three presenters, Mary Beard, David Olusoga and Simon Schama. A co-production with PBS in the United States, it would not cover western European civilisation in the same detail, but would additionally cover Graeco-Roman and non-European cultures. The series, reduced from the planned ten to nine episodes, was trailed in February 2018, with transmission starting on 1 March in the UK and 17 April in the US on PBS.

<doc id="565923" wikidata="Q466245" url="?curid=565923" title="Martin Ferguson (politician)">
<text>Martin John Ferguson (born 12 December 1953) is an Australian former Labor Party politician who was the Member of the House of Representatives for Batman from 1996 to 2013. He served as Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism in the Rudd and Gillard governments from 2007 to 2013.

Before entering Parliament, Ferguson spent a long career as a trade unionist, being General Secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers&#x27; Union from 1984 to 1990 and President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions from 1990 to 1996. He is the son of Jack Ferguson who was Deputy Premier of New South Wales from 1976 to 1984. His brother is Laurie Ferguson, also a long-serving Labor MP.

==Trade unionist==
Born in Sydney to Jack Ferguson and Mary Ellen, Ferguson was educated at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Strathfield, and the University of Sydney. After leaving university, he became a research officer at the Federated Miscellaneous Workers&#x27; Union, eventually rising to become Assistant General Secretary, and later General Secretary in 1984, during which time he was also appointed as a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) executive board.

As FMWU General Secretary, and from 1985 to 1990 as Vice President of the ACTU, Ferguson worked closely alongside the likes of Bill Kelty and Simon Crean to negotiate with the Hawke-Keating government the Prices and Incomes Accord. After Crean&#x27;s election to the House of Representatives at the 1990 election, Ferguson was elected his replacement as ACTU President, and became a member of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization. For his services to industrial relations in Australia, Ferguson was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1996.

==Political career==

Ferguson won preselection for the safe Labor seat of Batman in 1995, after a deal was negotiated between the right-wing Labor Unity faction in Victoria and the ALP National Executive. At the local level, the majority Greek party membership, largely resulting from heavy branch stacking, was likely to support a candidate other than Ferguson, however no local candidate was likely to receive support from the 50 per cent vote in the preselection panel which had been elected by the Victorian ALP State Conference. The other candidates, Jenny Mikakos and Theo Theophanous, then members of competing Left factions, were forced to withdraw from a local preselection plebiscite in favour of Ferguson, as a result of these negotiations.

After his election to the House of Representatives in March 1996, new Opposition Leader Kim Beazley appointed Ferguson as Shadow Minister for Regional and Urban Development and Shadow Minister for Transport and Infrastructure. He remained in the Shadow Cabinet under the leaderships of Simon Crean, Mark Latham and Kevin Rudd. After the latter won the 2007 election, Ferguson was appointed Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. He continued in both roles after Julia Gillard succeeded Rudd as Prime Minister in June 2010, and resigned from both in March 2013, ahead of his retirement from Parliament that August.

===Uranium debate===
Ferguson is a supporter of uranium mining in Australia and in 2005, Ferguson addressed an Australian Uranium Conference and said &quot;We as a community have to be part of the ever-complex question of how we clean up the world&#x27;s climate. And part of that debate is going to be nuclear power.&quot;

The anti-nuclear movement in Australia is stronger than in other developed countries. Friends of the Earth have strongly opposed Ferguson&#x27;s advocacy for expanding the export of uranium beyond the existing three-mine policy which Ferguson sought to overturn at the ALP&#x27;s national conference in April 2007. The lobby group Northern Anti Nuclear Alliance has distributed 60,000 leaflets critical of his policy in his electorate of Batman. He also supported – in scientific terms – the proposal of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke for Australia to become the world&#x27;s storage facility for nuclear waste although he said that it was politically not possible.

He told ABC Radio that it was wrong to ban uranium exports to the People&#x27;s Republic of China: &quot;The Labor Party adopts the view that we&#x27;re open for investment. It&#x27;s about economic growth and jobs in Australia. Is China to be treated any different to South Korea, Japan, France, United States? I don&#x27;t think so. We don&#x27;t have one rule for China in terms of overseas investment and economic growth and jobs and another rule for Japan.&quot;

====Coal seam gas====
In the lead up to the 2015 NSW state election, Ferguson criticised NSW Labor leader Luke Foley over his proposal to ban coal seam gas extraction.

A range of Labor figures doubled down on efforts to oust Ferguson from the party.

====Privatisation====
In 2015, Ferguson come out in support for the Liberal government plan to sell 49% of the government&#x27;s electricity distributors. Ferguson even went further, saying he was &quot;ashamed of the Party&quot; and accusing Foley and the unions of &quot;deliberately misleading the public, creating unnecessary fear and trying to scare people&quot;.

== Career after politics ==
Since leaving parliament in 2013, Ferguson has continued to advocate for Australia&#x27;s tourism, energy and resources sector. As of 2019, Ferguson was the chairman of the Clare Valley Wine &amp; Grape Association, the chairman of the advisory board of APPEA and has commercial interests in the sector as a non-executive director of Seven Group Holdings and BG Group. Since June 2015, Ferguson has also been Chair of Tourism Accommodation Australia.

In March 2020, Ferguson was appointed as a part-time Expert Panel member on the Fair Work Commission for the following five years.

On 19 May 2014, the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s WA Executive endorsed a motion to expel him from the party. However he has refused to resign and continues to be a member.

<text>Sir Isaac Vivian Alexander Richards (born 7 March 1952) is a retired Antiguan cricketer who represented the West Indies cricket team between 1974 and 1991. Usually batting at number three in a dominant West Indies side, Richards is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. Richards was part of the squads that won the 1975 Cricket World Cup and 1979 Cricket World Cup and finished as runners-up in the 1983 Cricket World Cup.

Richards made his Test debut in 1974 against India along with Gordon Greenidge. His best years were between 1976 and 1983, during which time he averaged a remarkable 66.51 with the bat in Test cricket. In 1984 he suffered from pterygium and had eye surgery which affected his eyesight and reflexes. Despite this, he remained one of the best batsmen in the world for the remaining four years of his career, though his average in the second half of his career was significantly lower than for the first. Richards scored 8,540 runs in 121 Test matches at an average of 50.23 and retired as the West Indies leading run-scorer, overhauling the aggregate of Garfield Sobers. He also scored 1,281 runs at an average of over 55 in World Series Cricket, which is sometimes regarded as the highest and most difficult level of cricket ever played. As a captain, he won 27 of 50 Test matches and lost only 8. He also scored nearly 7,000 runs in One Day Internationals and more than 36,000 in first-class cricket.

He was knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1999. In 2000 he was voted one of &quot;Wisden&quot;″s five Cricketers of the Century by a 100-member panel of experts, and in 2002 the almanack judged that he had played the best One Day International innings of all time. In December 2002, he was chosen by &quot;Wisden&quot; as the greatest One Day International batsman who had played to that date and as the third-greatest Test cricket batter. In 2009, Richards was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

In October 2013, &quot;Wisden&quot; selected the best test team in 150 years of test history and included Richards at No. 5. He is one of only two batsman of the post-war era (the other being Sachin Tendulkar) to feature in that team.

==Early life==
Richards was born to Malcolm and Gretel Richards in St. John&#x27;s, Antigua, then part of the British Leeward Islands. He attended St. John&#x27;s Boys Primary School and then Antigua Grammar Secondary School on a scholarship.

Richards discovered cricket at a young age. His brothers, Mervyn and Donald, both played the game, representing Antigua as amateurs, and they encouraged him to play. The young Richards initially practiced with his father and Pat Evanson, a neighbor and family friend, who had captained the Antigua side.

Richards left school aged 18, and worked at D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s Bar and Restaurant in St. John&#x27;s. He joined St. John&#x27;s Cricket Club and the owner of the restaurant where he worked, D&#x27;Arcy Williams, provided him with new whites, gloves, pads and a bat. After a few seasons with St. John&#x27;s C.C., he joined Rising Sun Cricket Club, where he remained until his departure to play abroad.

Richards was suspended from playing cricket for two years when he was a 17-year-old in 1969. Playing for Antigua against St Kitts, he got out for a golden duck much to the disgust of himself and the 6,000 supporters. Some supporters occupied the pitch and the game was held up for two hours. Richards was then given a second opportunity to bat in an effort to appease the supporters, who were almost rioting. In his second bat in the innings he was again out for a duck. Richards said of the incident:

&quot;I behaved very badly and I am not proud of it. But those in authority, who were advising me, didn&#x27;t do themselves very proud either. I was told to restore peace I should go back out to bat. I did not want to and was not very happy about it. Had I been a more experienced player then I think I would have refused. But go back I did. I was made to look a fool for the convenience of the local cricket authorities.&quot;

==Cricket career==
Richards made his first-class debut in January 1972 when he was 19. He took part in a non-competition match, representing the Leeward Islands against the Windwards: Richards made 20 and 26. His competitive debut followed a few days later. Playing in the domestic West Indian Shell Shield for the Combined Leeward and Windward Islands in Kingston, Jamaica versus Jamaica, he scored 15 and 32, top-scoring in the second innings in a heavy defeat for his side.

By the time Richards was 22, he had played matches in the Antigua, Leeward Islands and Combined Islands tournaments. In 1973, his abilities were noticed by Len Creed, Vice Chairman at Somerset, who was in Antigua at the time as part of a West Country touring side. Lester Bird and Danny Livingstone played an important part in pursuading Creed to take Richards to Somerset. Surrey had earlier rejected both Richards and Andy Roberts at the Surrey Indoor Nets in late 1972. &quot;They did not think we were good enough even to further our cricket education.&quot;

===Move to England, 1973–1974===
During 1973-74, Richards relocated to the United Kingdom, where Creed arranged for him to play league cricket for Lansdown C.C. in Bath. He made his Lansdown debut, as part of the second XI, at Weston-super-Mare on 26 April 1973. Richards was also employed by the club as assistant groundsman to head groundsman John Heyward, which allowed him some financial independence until his career was established. After his debut he was promoted to the first team where he was introduced to the Lansdown all-rounder &quot;Shandy&quot; Perera from Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Richards cites Perera as a major influence on his cricket development especially with regards to post-game analysis. He finished his first season at Lansdown top of the batting averages and shortly afterwards was offered a two-year contract with county side Somerset.

Richards then moved to Taunton in 1974 in preparation for his professional debut with Somerset CCC where he was assigned living accommodation by the club; a flat-share with two other county players: Ian Botham and Dennis Breakwell. On 27 April 1974 Richards made his Benson &amp; Hedges Cup debut for Somerset against Glamorgan in Swansea; after the game Somerset skipper Brian Close arranged a player&#x27;s ovation for Richards in recognition of his playing and contribution to the victory. Richards was awarded Man of the Match.

===Test debut to international stardom, 1975–1984===
Richards made his Test match debut for the West Indian cricket team in 1974 against India in Bangalore. He made an unbeaten 192 in the second Test of the same series in New Delhi. The West Indies saw him as a strong opener and he kept his profile up in the early years of his promising career.

In 1975, Richards helped the West Indies win the inaugural Cricket World Cup against Australia, a feat he later described as the most memorable of his career. He starred in the field, running out Alan Turner, Ian Chappell and Greg Chappell. The West Indies were again able to win the following World Cup in 1979, thanks to a Richards century in the final at Lord&#x27;s. Richards believes that on both occasions, despite internal island divisions, the Caribbean came together. 

1976 was perhaps Richards&#x27;s finest year: he scored 1710 runs, at an astonishing average of 90.00, with seven centuries in 11 Tests. This achievement is all the more remarkable considering he missed the second Test at Lord&#x27;s after contracting glandular fever; yet he returned to score his career-best 291 at the Oval later in the summer. This tally stood as the world record for most Test runs by a batsman in a single calendar year for 30 years until broken by Mohammad Yousuf of Pakistan on 30 November 2006.

Richards had a long and successful career in the County Championship in England, playing for many years for Somerset. In 1983, the team won the NatWest Trophy, with Richards and close friend Ian Botham having a playful slugging match in the final few overs. Richards also starred in Somerset&#x27;s victores in the finals of the 1979 Gillette Cup, and the 1981 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, making a century in both finals, also helping Somerset to win the 1979 John Player League and the 1982 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup.

Richards refused a &quot;blank-cheque&quot; offer to play for a rebel West Indies squad in South Africa during the Apartheid era in 1983, and again in 1984.

=== West Indies captain and Domestic Cricket, 1984–1991 ===

Richards captained the West Indies in 50 Test matches from 1984 to 1991. He is the only West Indies captain never to lose a Test series, and it is said that his fierce will to win contributed to this achievement. His captaincy was, however, not without controversy: one incident was his aggressive, &quot;finger-flapping&quot; appeal leading to the incorrect dismissal of England batsman Rob Bailey in the Barbados Test in 1990, which was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;at best undignified and unsightly. At worst, it was calculated gamesmanship&quot;. This behaviour would nowadays be penalised according to Section 2.5. of the Rules of Conduct of the ICC Code of Conduct.

During a match against Zimbabwe during the 1983 Cricket World Cup, Richards returned to the crease after a stoppage for bad light and accidentally took strike at the wrong end, which remains a very rare occurrence.

Richards continued to thrive in international cricket. He became the only man to score a century and take 5 wickets in the same one-day international when he played against New Zealand at Dunedin in 1986–87 - a feat that wasn&#x27;t broken until 2005. Moreover, in 1984, he rescued his side from a perilous position at Old Trafford and, in partnership with Michael Holding, smashed 189 to win the game off his own bat.

For his domestic appearances, Richards had joined Somerset in 1984. There, he made his highest first-class score, 322, when they played Warwickshire in 1985. However, despite his totemic presence at Somerset, over time his performances declined as he devoted most of his time to international cricket. The county finished bottom of the County Championship in 1985, and next to bottom in 1986. In 1988, the county was surrounded by controversy when Somerset&#x27;s new captain Peter Roebuck became an instrumental piece in the decision not to renew the contracts of Richards and his West Indies teammate Joel Garner, whose runs and wickets had brought the county much success in the previous eight years. Somerset proposed to replace the pair with New Zealand batsman Martin Crowe. Consequently, Ian Botham refused a new contract with Somerset in protest at the way his friends Richards and Garner had been treated and promptly joined Worcestershire. After many years of bitterness over the event and the eventual removal of Roebuck from the club, Richards was eventually honoured with the naming of a set of entrance gates after him at the County Ground, Taunton.

In November 1988, while on tour of Australia with the West Indies, Richards became the first West Indies player to reach 100 first-class centuries by scoring 101 against New South Wales. Richards remains the only West Indies player to achieve this milestone, and among non-England qualified players only Don Bradman (117) scored more first-class centuries than Richards&#x27;s 114.

Richards returned to county cricket for the 1990 season towards the end of his career to play for Glamorgan, helping them to win the AXA Sunday League in 1993.

==After cricket==
Richards is a commentator on BBC&#x27;s Test Match Special (TMS). He participated in Prince Edward of the United Kingdom&#x27;s 1987 charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;. He was featured in the 2010 documentary movie &quot;Fire in Babylon&quot; and spoke about his experiences playing for the West Indies. Richards joined the Delhi Daredevils as their mentor in The Indian Premier League in 2013, and also mentored the Quetta Gladiators in the 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022 Pakistan Super League.

==Personality and playing style==
Quiet and self-contained away from the pitch, Richards was a very powerful right-handed batsman with an extremely attacking style, &quot;possibly the most destructive batsman the sport has ever seen&quot;. He was also an excellent fielder and a more than competent off-spin bowler. He is often regarded as the most physically devastating and exciting batsman that ever played the game by cricketers, journalists, fans and others alike, and played his entire 17-year career without a helmet.

His fearless and aggressive style of play, and relaxed but determined demeanor made him a great crowd favourite and an intimidating prospect for opposition bowlers all over the world. The word &quot;swagger&quot; is frequently used to describe his batting style. His batting often completely dominated opposing bowlers. He had the ability to drive good-length balls from outside off-stump through midwicket, his trademark shot, and was one of the great exponents of the hook shot.

Richards was notorious for punishing bowlers that dared to sledge him, so much so, that many opposing captains banned their players from the practice. However, when playing for Somerset in a county game against Glamorgan, Greg Thomas attempted to sledge Richards after he had played and missed at several balls in a row. He sarcastically informed Richards: &quot;It&#x27;s red, round and it&#x27;s about five ounces, in case you were wondering.&quot; Richards then hammered the next delivery for 6, straight out of the stadium and into a nearby river. Turning back to the bowler, he commented: &quot;You know what it looks like, now go and find it.&quot;

== Autobiographies ==
Richards, with David Foot, wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Viv Richards&quot;, in 1979.

In 1991, Richards published a second autobiography entitled &quot;Hitting Across the Line&quot;. In the book, Richards describes how his whole life revolved around sports, cricket in particular. Of special interest is his technique, expressed by the title of the book. To hit across the line of the ball is considered taboo, and dangerously risky. However, Richards&#x27;s explanation of the conditions in which he played cricket in Antigua as a child, explains how this technique came to be.

==Achievements==
===Statistical summary===

In his Test career, he scored 8,540 runs in 121 Test matches at an average of 50.23 (including 24 centuries). Richards also scored 5 centuries in World Series Cricket between 1977 and 1979. These are not recognised by the ICC as &quot;official&quot; Test centuries. Richards won 27 of 50 matches as a Test captain, and lost only 8. He is also the scorer of the equal second fastest-ever Test century, from just 56 balls against England in Antigua during the 1986 tour. He hit 84 sixes in Test cricket. His highest innings of 291 is equal seventh (along with Ramnaresh Sarwan) on the list of West Indies&#x27; highest individual scores.

===Honours===

In 1994, Richards was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to cricket. In 1999, he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Nation (KCN) by his native country Antigua and Barbuda. In 2006, he was upgraded to Antigua and Barbuda highest award, Knight of the Order of the National Hero (KNH).

The Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua, is named in his honour. It was built for use in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The ground has hosted three Test matches, as well as a number of One-Day Internationals and T20 Internationals.

The Richards–Botham Trophy, replacing the Wisden Trophy for winners of West Indies–England Test series, is named in honour of Richards and Sir Ian Botham.

In 2022, during the opening ceremony of the forty-third regular meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM, Richards was awarded the Order of the Caribbean Community (OOC), the highest honour that can be conferred upon a Caribbean national. The award confers the styling &quot;The Honourable&quot; as well.

==Legacy and place in cricket history==
In 2000, Richards was named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century, coming fifth behind Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Jack Hobbs and Shane Warne in the poll of 100 international cricket experts appointed by &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;.

Several prominent personalities including former cricketer Imran Khan and writer John Birmingham are of the opinion that Richards was the best ever batsman against genuine fast bowling. For Barry Richards, Ravi Shastri and Neil Fairbrother, he has been cited as the best batsman they personally witnessed. Wasim Akram rates Richards as the greatest batsman he ever bowled to, ahead of Sunil Gavaskar and Martin Crowe.

Akram also rates Richards as the best and most complete batsman he ever saw ahead of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. Crowe himself rated Richards as the best batsman he played against, along with Greg Chappell. Muttiah Muralitharan and Shane Warne, arguably the two greatest spinners of all time, both idolize Richards. Murali idolized Richards in his years growing up, while Warne rates him the greatest batsman &quot;for me&quot;, and overall just after Bradman.

Ian Botham who is regarded as one of the greatest all-rounders of all time and one of England&#x27;s greatest cricketers, rates Richards as the greatest batsman he ever saw ahead of Sunil Gavaskar, Greg Chappell, Martin Crowe, Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. Michael Holding, often regarded as one of the greatest fast bowlers of all time and part of the West Indies four-prolonged pace attack during the late 1970s and early 1980s rates Richards as the greatest batsman he witnessed in the last 50 years. England&#x27;s fast bowling great Bob Willis rated Richards as greatest batsman he ever witnessed and best he ever bowled to.

Australian fast bowling greats Jeff Thomson (often regarded as the fastest bowler in cricket history) and Dennis Lillee rate Richards as the best batsman they ever bowled against. Lillee also termed him &quot;the supreme player&quot;. Thomson also rates Richards as the greatest batsman he bowled against. Former Australian captain Ian Chappell, who is regarded as one of the best cricket captains of all time, rates Richards as the most intimidating and dangerous batsman he ever saw, who often changed games simply by walking to the crease.
Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar who are regarded as two of the greatest modern day batsman rates Richards as the best they ever saw and their batting idol while growing up. Kumar Sangakara, former Sri Lankan Wicket keeper batsman often rates Richards along with Lara as the greatest batsman he ever witnessed and further calls Richards as his cricketing idol while growing up. Former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-haq rates Richards as the greatest batsman he ever saw ahead of both Tendulkar and Lara.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has produced rankings for batsmen and bowlers for both the longer and shorter versions. In the ratings for Test Cricket, Richards holds the equal-seventh-highest peak rating (938), after Sir Donald Bradman (961), Steve Smith (947), Sir Len Hutton, Sir Jack Hobbs, Ricky Ponting and Peter May. The One Day International (ODI) ratings place Richards first, followed by Zaheer Abbas and Greg Chappell. He topped the rankings at the end of the years 1976, 1977, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986.

He was voted the greatest cricketer since 1970 in a poll, ahead of Ian Botham and Shane Warne. That poll saw both Botham and Warne vote for Richards, and in the opinions of both, Richards is the greatest batsman they ever saw. In 2006, in a study done by a team of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Cricinfo&quot; magazine, Richards was again chosen as the greatest ODI Batsman ever.

To mark 150 years of the &quot;Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;, Wisden named him in an all-time Test World XI.

==Football==
Some writers contend that Richards also played international football for Antigua and Barbuda, appearing in qualifying matches for the 1974 World Cup. However, he does not appear in recorded line-ups for these matches.

==Personal life==
Richards and his wife Miriam have two children, including Mali, who has also played first-class cricket. Richards is also godfather to Ian Botham&#x27;s son, Liam.

Richards had a brief relationship with Indian actress Neena Gupta, with whom he has a daughter, fashion designer Masaba Gupta.
