<text>The Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw (company model number S-55) is a multi-purpose piston-engined helicopter that was used by the United States Army and United States Air Force. It was also license-built by Westland Aircraft as the Westland Whirlwind in the United Kingdom. United States Navy and United States Coast Guard models were designated HO4S, while those of the U.S. Marine Corps were designated HRS. In 1962, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Marine Corps versions were all redesignated as H-19s like their U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force counterparts.

The H-19 pioneered the use of a nose-mounted radial engine powering a single fully articulated main rotor located above the cabin, which helped maintain a proper center of gravity under varying loading conditions without requiring ballast to maintain longitudinal stability as with prior Sikorsky designs. This layout gave the H-19 series a characteristic bulbous-nosed appearance and made it one of the first truly successful single-rotor utility helicopters, leading to a number of derivative designs including the Sikorsky H-34, which was produced in even greater numbers. The H-19 had a long military career worldwide in the late 20th century and also proved popular with civil operators.

==Development==

Development of the H-19 was initiated privately by Sikorsky without government sponsorship. The helicopter was initially designed as a testbed for several novel design concepts intended to provide greater load-carrying ability in combination with easy maintenance. Under the leadership of designer Edward F. Katzenberger, a mockup was designed and fabricated in less than one year.

The first customer was the United States Air Force, which ordered five YH-19 aircraft for evaluation; the YH-19&#x27;s first flight was on 10 November 1949, less than a year after the program start date. This was followed by delivery of the first YH-19 to the U.S. Air Force on 16 April 1950 and delivery of the first HO4S-1 helicopter to the U. S. Navy on 31 August 1950. A U.S. Air Force YH-19 was sent to Korea for service trials in March 1951, where it was joined by a second YH-19 in September 1951. On 27 April 1951, the first HRS-1 was delivered to the U.S. Marine Corps, and on 2 May 1951, the first S-55 was delivered to Westland Aircraft.

1,281 of the helicopters were manufactured by Sikorsky in the United States. An additional 447 were manufactured by licensees of the helicopter including Westland Aircraft, SNCASE in France and Mitsubishi in Japan.

The helicopter was widely exported, used by many other nations, including Portugal, Greece, Israel, Chile, South Africa, Denmark and Turkey.

In 1954 the U.S. Marine Corps tested an idea to enhance lift in hot-and-high and/or heavily loaded conditions by installing a rocket nozzle at the tip of each rotor blade with the fuel tank located in the center above the rotor blade hub. Enough fuel was provided for seven minutes of operation. Although tests of the system were considered successful, it was never adopted operationally.

==Design==

Major innovations implemented on the H-19 were the forward placement of the engine below the crew compartment and in front of the main cabin, the use of offset flapping hinges located from the center of the rotor, and the use of hydraulic servos for the main rotor controls. These features yielded an aircraft that was far more capable in a transport role than previous Sikorsky designs.

The forward engine location placed the main cabin essentially in line with the main rotor&#x27;s rotational axis and close to the aircraft center of gravity, making it easier to maintain proper weight and balance under differing loading conditions. The impetus for this design choice was the recent rejection of the Sikorsky XHJS by the U.S. Navy in favor of the tandem rotor Piasecki HUP Retriever; the Navy had strongly objected to the necessity to use ballast in the cabin-forward XHJS to maintain proper weight and balance, prompting Sikorsky to seek single-rotor design alternatives that did not require this.

Another benefit of this engine location was ease of maintenance, as the engine could be readily accessed at ground level through dual clamshell-style doors; the entire engine could be changed in only two hours, and the radial engine was oriented backwards relative to a typical airplane installation, allowing more convenient access to engine accessories.
The offset flapping hinges and hydraulic servos gave more positive flight control under differing loading conditions, isolated the flight controls from vibration, and lessened control forces; the H-19 could be flown with only two fingers on the cyclic control.

The YH-19 prototypes featured a blunt aft fuselage and a single starboard-mounted horizontal tailplane with a small vertical fin at its outboard end. Initial production models added a large fillet-like fin behind the fuselage and under the tailboom, and the tailplane configuration was changed to an inverted &quot;V&quot; shape.

Early H-19 and HO4S variants were powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340-57 radial rated at and used a centrifugal clutch that automatically engaged the main rotor when a preset engine speed was reached. However, the HO4S was deemed underpowered in U.S. Navy service with this powerplant, so the aircraft was re-engined with a Wright R-1300-3 radial which the U.S. Navy found to be adequate in an air–sea rescue role; the H-19B, HO4S-3, HRS-3, and subsequent models would use this powerplant. The R-1300 models also used a single horizontal tailplane in place of the early inverted &quot;V&quot; style, and a new hydro-mechanical clutch gave smoother and more rapid rotor acceleration during clutch engagement and allowed the engine to be started and operated at any speed while disengaged from the transmission and rotors.

Early civilian and military S-55 models offered a folding capacity hoist above the starboard main cabin door, while later models could be equipped with a more capable and reliable capacity unit. Starting with the introduction of the S-55C in October 1956, the tailboom was inclined three degrees downward to provide more main rotor clearance during hard landings; models equipped with the inclined tail also used an tail rotor in place of the earlier unit.

==Operational history==
The H-19 Chickasaw holds the distinction of being the U.S. Army&#x27;s first true transport helicopter and, as such, played an important role in the initial formulation of Army doctrine regarding air mobility and the battlefield employment of troop-carrying helicopters. The H-19 underwent live service tests in the hands of the 6th Transportation Company, during the Korean War beginning in 1951 as an unarmed transport helicopter. Undergoing tests such as medical evacuation, tactical control and frontline cargo support, the helicopter succeeded admirably in surpassing the capabilities of the H-5 Dragonfly which had been used throughout the war by the Army.

The U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) made extensive use of the H-19 in the Korean War. It was designated as the HRS in USMC service. Marine Squadron HMR-161 arrived in Korea on 2 September 1951 with 15 HRS-1 helicopters. The new helicopter squadron started operations upon arrival. On 13 September 1951, during Operation Windmill I, HMR-161 transported of gear and 74 Marines onto a ridge in the Punchbowl area. A week later HMR-161 shuttled 224 recon company marines and of supplies to a remote hilltop in the same area. Their performance continued to improve and in Operation Haylift II on 23–27 February 1953, HMR-161 lifted of cargo to resupply two regiments. Although HMR-161 helicopters were operating in &quot;hot&quot; landing zones near enemy troops, they did not lose any helicopters to enemy fire. HRS-1 helicopters were also used to relocate rocket launcher batteries; the rockets created a dust cloud when fired, making the launcher a target for counter-battery fire, so launchers and crews were moved twice a day. Each HRS-1 helicopter carried four rocket launchers and extra rockets as external cargo, with the crew in the cabin. The HRS-1 helicopter proved to be durable and reliable in Korean service. One reportedly flew home after losing of main rotor blade to a tree. HMR-161 reported 90% aircraft availability.

The success of helicopter operations with the USMC prompted the service to seek a military light utility vehicle that the HRS could lift, leading to the development of the aluminum-bodied, M422 Mighty Mite in the early 1950s. However, developmental issues delayed deployment of the M422 until 1959, by which time the HRS was being replaced by utility helicopters capable of lifting standard U.S. light utility vehicles, rendering the M422 unnecessary anddue to its unique designa supply chain liability. The Mighty Mite was only produced in small numbers and was mostly withdrawn from service by the late 1960s.

The U.S. Air Force (USAF) ordered 50 H-19A&#x27;s for rescue duties in 1951. These aircraft were the primary rescue and medical evacuation helicopters for the USAF during the Korean War. The Air Force continued to use the H-19 through the 1960s, ultimately acquiring 270 of the H-19B model.

A notable rescue involving a USAF H-19 occurred on 12 April 1953 when a North American F-86 Sabre flown by leading American flying ace Joseph C. McConnell was riddled with cannon fire from an enemy MiG-15 during a patrol over MiG Alley. McConnell was able to turn and shoot down the attacking MiG, but his F-86 was badly damaged and began losing engine power. Realizing he could not make it back to base, McConnell headed for the USAF rescue base at Cho-do, spotting an H-19 below him. H-19 pilots Joe Sullivan and Don Crabb, alerted that two damaged Sabres were headed towards them, saw McConnell&#x27;s F-86 and changed course to parallel it. McConnell ejected over the Yellow Sea near the helicopter and was pulled from the water within two minutes by H-19 medic Arthur Gillespie; McConnell later told his sister &quot;I barely got wet.&quot; Seeking favorable publicity for its ace pilots in Korea, the USAF circulated a rescue photo which was widely published in U.S. newspapers; however, Sullivan, Crabb, and Gillespie were flying a different H-19 without rescue markings that day. Historian Kenneth P. Werrell writes that the misleading, staged photo was likely a ruse to conceal the fact that the H-19 was not originally on an air rescue mission but was instead supporting special operations in the Cho-do area.

On 1 September 1953, Sabena used the S-55 to inaugurate the first commercial helicopter service in Europe, with routes between Rotterdam and Maastricht in the Netherlands and Cologne and Bonn in West Germany.

France made aggressive use of helicopters in Algeria, both as troop transports and gunships. Piasecki H-21 and Sud-built Sikorsky H-34 helicopters rapidly displaced fixed-wing aircraft for the transport of paras and quick-reaction commando teams. In Indochina, a small number of Hiller H-23s and H-19s were available for casualty evacuation. In 1956, the French Air Force experimented with arming the H-19, then being superseded in service by the more capable H-21 and H-34. The H-19 was originally fitted with a 20mm cannon, two rocket launchers, two 12.7mm machine guns, and a 7.5mm light machine gun firing from the cabin windows, but this load proved far too heavy, and even lightly armed H-19 gunships fitted with flexible machine guns for self-defense proved underpowered.

The H-19 was also used by the French forces in the First Indochina War. A small number of war-worn H-19s were given to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force in 1958, when the French military departed. These saw very limited service in the early days of the Vietnam War, before being supplanted by the more capable H-34.

Pakistan ordered eight S-55s in 1956 to equip search and rescue squadrons of the Pakistan Air Force. They saw service during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War, flying various missions including counterintelligence operations at Karachi in co-operation with the Army. They were retired from service in 1971.

The H-19 left U.S. military service when the CH-19E was retired by U.S. Navy squadron HC-5 on 26 February 1969. Surplus H-19s were sold on the open market, and civil interest was sufficient that Sikorsky (and later Orlando Helicopter Airways or OHA) offered conversion kits allowing a military surplus H-19 to be commercially operated under a standard Federal Aviation Administration type certificate as an S-55B. Turboshaft conversions were also offered by aftermarket modification companies.

A novel civil conversion of the H-19 by OHA was the Heli-Camper, a campervan-like conversion—featuring a built-in mini-kitchen and sleeping accommodations for four. In the late 1970s, OHA participated in a joint effort with popular American recreational vehicle (RV) manufacturer Winnebago Industries to market the aircraft, now renamed the Winnebago Heli-Home. A larger version based on the Sikorsky S-58 was also developed, and optional floats were offered for amphibious operations. The aircraft were featured in several American popular magazines and reportedly drew large crowds at RV shows and dealerships, but their high purchase price together with rising 1970s fuel prices resulted in very limited sales; production is not well documented, but is estimated at only six or seven of the S-55 and S-58 versions combined.

In the mid-1980s, the U.S. Army sought an economical helicopter to simulate the sound and radar signature of the Soviet Mil Mi-24 during exercises. OHA sold the Army fifteen modified S-55/Mi-24s with a new five-bladed rotor system, which was quieter than the original three-bladed rotor and made the aircraft sound similar to an Mi-24. The piston engines and original Sikorsky tail rotors were retained.

OHA also produced the S-55QT Whisper Jet, an extra-quiet civil conversion based on the five-bladed S-55/Mi-24, but using an Garrett TPE331 derated to from the S-55T, which lowered the aircraft&#x27;s empty weight by . The aircraft were also outfitted with special intake and exhaust silencers, carbon fiber noise-absorbing engine compartment doors, and a transparent Plexiglas floor. Five aircraft were built in 1999 to comply with strict National Park Service noise limits for Grand Canyon aerial tours; however, the aircraft were only used in this role for two years because it was difficult for pilots in the high-mounted cockpit to communicate with tourists in the main cabin. After being retired from sightseeing, the helicopters were used in utility and lift roles.

<text>Spiderweb Software is an independent video game developer founded in 1994 by Jeff Vogel in Seattle, Washington. Its primary focus is on creating demoware games for the Mac, Microsoft Windows, Android and the iPad. The games emphasize storytelling and turn-based gameplay and use a retro style of graphics.

==Games==
===Developed games===
Spiderweb Software is most notable for the following RPG video games:
* The &quot;Exile&quot; trilogy of underground adventures (1995-1997).
** &quot;Blades of Exile&quot;, a non-canonical continuation featuring a scenario creation kit.
* &quot;Nethergate&quot;, a fantasy game based upon the Roman occupation of Britain (1998). The game was eventually revamped under the title &quot;Nethergate: Resurrection&quot; (2007).
* The first &quot;Avernum&quot; trilogy, which are expanded remakes of the &quot;Exile&quot; series, using the Nethergate game engine, with several enhancements to the visual design and gameplay (2000-2002).
** &quot;Blades of Avernum&quot;, a non-canonical continuation featuring a scenario creation kit.
* The five-part &quot;Geneforge&quot; series, notable for its unique gameplay involving the creation of creatures to assist the player (2001-2008).
* The Second &quot;Avernum&quot; trilogy, continuing and ultimately finishing the story of Avernum, using a variation of the &quot;Geneforge&quot; game engine (2005-2009).
* &quot;&quot;, the first game in a new trilogy (2011). &quot;Avadon&quot; features a new game setting, interface, and combat system.
** &quot;Avadon 2: The Corruption&quot;. The second game released in the &quot;Avadon&quot; trilogy (2013).
** &quot;Avadon 3: The Warborn&quot;. The third game released in the &quot;Avadon&quot; trilogy (2016).
* &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;Avernum 2: Crystal Souls&quot; (2015), and &quot;Avernum 3: Ruined World&quot; (2018), remakes of the first &quot;Avernum&quot; trilogy, with reworked game mechanics, and new graphics and sound effects.
* &quot;Queen&#x27;s Wish: The Conqueror&quot;, the first game in a new fantasy series (2019). This series focuses on capturing and building fortresses and explores the mechanics and morality of building empires.
** &quot;Queen&#x27;s Wish 2: The Tormentor&quot;. The second game released in the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Wish&quot; trilogy. It was released on August 24, 2022.
* &quot;Geneforge 1 - Mutagen&quot; (2021) is a remake of the first &quot;Geneforge&quot; game. It was released on February 24, 2021.
** &quot;Geneforge 2 - Infestation&quot; (2024) is a remake of the second &quot;Geneforge&quot; game. It was released on March 27, 2024.

===Distributed games===
The company previously provided distribution services and other support for other shareware developers, including Richard White and &quot;Crystal Shard&quot;. The games included:

* &quot;Galactic Core&quot; (developed by Richard White).

* &quot;Ocean Bound&quot; (developed by Richard White).
* &quot;SubTerra&quot; (developed by Crystal Shard).
* &quot;Homeland: The Stone of Night&quot; (developed by Dragon Lore).

In June 2007, Jeff Vogel announced that the company would no longer be supporting games by other developers, and they are no longer available for download through Spiderweb&#x27;s main site.

<doc id="574698" wikidata="Q17375334" url="?curid=574698" title="Archbishop of Kraków">
<text>The archbishop of Kraków is the head of the archdiocese of Kraków. A bishop of Kraków first came into existence when the diocese was created in 1000; it was promoted to an archdiocese on 28 October 1925. Due to Kraków&#x27;s role as Poland&#x27;s political, cultural and spiritual center, the bishops and archbishops of Kraków were often very influential in the city, country and abroad. From 1443 to 1791, bishops of Kraków were simultaneously Dukes of Siewierz, although it was only Adam Stefan Sapieha who officially abandoned the title.



== Auxiliary bishops ==
Since 1303, the archdiocese of Kraków has frequently had one or more auxiliary bishops as well as the metropolitan bishop.

<text>Cyane (; from ) was a naiad in Greek mythology who tried to prevent Hades from abducting Persephone, her playmate.

== Mythology ==
Cyane (sometimes anglicized as &quot;Kyane&quot;) was a naiad, a freshwater nymph. After witnessing Hades&#x27;s abduction of Persephone and trying to prevent it, Cyane was turned to liquid by Hades. In Ovid&#x27;s version, she dissolved away in tears upon failing to save her friend and melted into her pool.

In the ancient Greek world the nymph represented a particular aspect of nature. Arethusa, a naiad like Kyane, is associated with a spring and pool in Syracuse (Siracusa); Kyane is said to dwell in a river bearing her name in southeastern Sicily. She had as a partner the river god Anapus. She cited their love as an example of consensual relationship while trying to convince Hades not to take Persephone by force.

==Popular culture==
In the popular TV series &quot;&quot;, &quot;Cyane&quot; is a recurring name of prominent Amazon warriors, each considered the worthy successor of the former one: five different Cyanes (from different times) are shown in &quot;Xenaverse&quot;, played respectively by Victoria Pratt as &quot;Cyane III&quot;, Selma Blair as &quot;Cyane I&quot;, Shelley Edwards as &quot;Cyane IV&quot; and Morgan Reese Fairhead as &quot;Cyane V&quot;. &quot;Cyane II&quot; appears in &quot;Young Hercules&quot; series, played by Katrina Browne. There are probably some other Cyanes between &quot;Cyane I&quot; and &quot;Cyane II&quot;, but they are not shown in the series. All shown Cyanes are powerful and charismatic, but &quot;Cyane IV&quot; is somewhat aphoristic, and &quot;Cyane V&quot; overly polite and shy. The first Cyane came from the future: she taught Amazons to tame horses and (in a strange time loop) gave them the name &quot;Amazons&quot;.

A powerful person, &quot;Cyane III&quot; defeated both Xena (in a physical battle) and Alti (in a spiritual battle). She was trusting of Xena and even offered to let her join the tribe. Xena betrayed Cyane when Alti &quot;offered her a better deal&quot;. Alti wanted Cyane&#x27;s blood, and after she drank it she kept Cyane&#x27;s soul and the souls of all the Amazons in the land of the dead. She then used their power for herself and made it evil. The souls of the Amazons were trapped in the land of the dead until the reformed Xena killed Alti and found the Amazon&#x27;s new holy word, Love.

<doc id="574705" wikidata="Q3161289" url="?curid=574705" title="James Moore (Canadian politician)">
<text>James Moore (born June 10, 1976) is a Canadian politician who formerly served as the Minister of Industry in the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

Moore was the Conservative Member of Parliament from 2000 to 2015, representing Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam (2000–2004) and then Port Moody—Westwood—Port Coquitlam (2004–2015). He also served as Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages and as the Secretary of State for Official Languages, Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics before becoming Industry Minister. Prior to entering cabinet, he was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Public Works and to the Minister for the Pacific Gateway &amp; 2010 Olympics.

Moore did not run in the 2015 federal election, and in November 2015, it was announced that he would be the 6th Chancellor of the University of Northern British Columbia, starting May 2016.

==Background==
Moore was born in New Westminster, British Columbia on June 10, 1976 and was raised in the city of Coquitlam. Following his graduation from Centennial Sr. Secondary, he pursued studies in economics and business administration at Douglas College. In 1996, he started working as a broadcaster at CKST AM1040 in Vancouver. In 1997, he moved to Ottawa to work as the Communications Advisor for the Official Opposition, which at that time was the Reform Party of Canada. In 1998, Moore returned to broadcasting in Vancouver before moving to Prince George to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science at the University of Northern British Columbia. While in Prince George he continued in broadcasting by guest hosting at 550 CKPG and launching his own talk show entitled &quot;’Behind the Headlines’ with James Moore.&quot; In 2011, Moore earned his Master of Arts degree in Political Studies from the University of Saskatchewan.

==Political career==

===Opposition member===
In the 2000 federal election Moore was the Canadian Alliance candidate in the federal riding of Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. At the age of 24 Moore defeated Liberal Party incumbent Lou Sekora by a 20 percentage point margin. With his election win Moore became the youngest member of Parliament ever elected in the province of British Columbia. As a member of the Official Opposition Moore served as Deputy Foreign Affairs Critic and Deputy National Revenue Critic, and was later promoted to serve as the Senior Transport Critic and Vice-Chair of the Commons Transport Committee. In 2003, the Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to form the Conservative Party of Canada. In the 2004 federal election Moore was re-elected in the new riding of Port Moody—Westwood—Port Coquitlam, winning 41% of the popular the vote. Following his re-election he served as the Official Opposition Transportation Critic, as well as Amateur Sport Critic.

In 2004, Moore was one of the few members of his caucus to vote in favour of same-sex marriage. After taking a long time to study the issue he stated &quot;In short, I believe in equality under the law for all Canadians for civil marriages, which in a perfect world would be termed civil unions&quot;.

===Government member===
In the 2006 federal election the Conservative Party won a minority government and Moore was re-elected in his riding over former Coquitlam mayor, Jon Kingsbury. On February 7, 2006, Moore was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Public Works and Government Services Canada and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Pacific Gateway and the Vancouver-Whistler Olympics. Moore was responsible for answering questions regarding Public Works and Government Services during Question Period due to the minister, Michael Fortier, being a senator as opposed to a member of Parliament.

On June 25, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Moore as the Secretary of State for the 2010 Olympics, the Asia-Pacific Gateway and Official Languages. With his appointment he became the youngest Cabinet Minister in British Columbia&#x27;s history and the fourth youngest Cabinet Minister in Canadian history. Less than three months later Harper called an election for October 14, 2008. Moore was easily re-elected in the 2008 federal election and the Conservative Party won their second minority government.

===Minister of Canadian Heritage===
On October 30, 2008, Moore was appointed Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages. Moore&#x27;s appointment came after Harper had sparked controversy during the recent election campaign when he made comments that &quot;ordinary people&quot; didn&#x27;t care about arts funding. The comments were negatively received, particularly in Quebec, and it is thought to have contributed to the Conservatives not winning a majority government.

In the 2011 federal election Moore was once again re-elected in his riding and the Conservative Party won their first majority government. It was speculated that Moore could be promoted to a higher profile ministry when Harper shuffled his cabinet, however he remained Minister of Heritage when the new cabinet was sworn in. The resignation and defeat of several ministers did lead to his appointment as the senior regional Minister from British Columbia, he became the youngest person to ever hold the post. Moore was seen as one of the most influential members within his caucus, and with Prime Minister Harper. Though Harper did not appoint a Deputy Prime Minister, Jason Kenney was seen by many as the de facto Deputy Prime Minister. Maclean&#x27;s columnist Paul Wells wrote in 2011 that Moore, whose views contrast with the more socially conservative Kenney, was a near-equal to Kenney within cabinet. Moore&#x27;s portfolio was an important one to Quebeckers and, with only four Conservative members of Parliament in the province, Moore became a central figure in the province for the party, despite hailing from British Columbia.

====CBC====
As Minister of Canadian Heritage Moore was nominally responsible for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), a Crown corporation. On November 19, 2008, Moore warned CBC executives to rein in their spending practises after it was revealed that CBC&#x27;s executive vice-president for French services, racked up more than $80,000 in 2006 on expenses such as theatre tickets, hotels, and catering. The information was revealed the same week that other Canadian broadcasters were announcing hiring freezes and layoffs. The President of CBC announced on November 21, 2008 that the corporation would be cutting spending and reviewing its major projects.

Moore has been a defender of the CBC and has spoken about its importance as a key cultural institution. This despite calls from some within the Conservative Party to stop funding or sell the CBC. Downsizing and decentralizing of the broadcaster is a goal for Moore and the Conservative government. In December 2011, he stated that under his leadership staffing at the CBC had decreased by about 25%.

====Interim Minister of Aboriginal Affairs====
On February 15, 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper appointed Moore as acting Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development after the sudden resignation of John Duncan. Duncan resigned after improperly advocating to a tax court on behalf of a constituent in June 2011. Moore remained interim minister until Bernard Valcourt was appointed on February 22, 2013.

===Minister of Industry===
On July 15, 2013, Moore was appointed Minister of Industry. As Minister of Industry, Moore Chaired the Cabinet Committee on Economic prosperity, which was responsible for considering all economic proposals.

==== Internal Free Trade ====
in 2014 Moore made a major effort to open Canada&#x27;s internal markets to greater free trade. Tabling a report entitled &quot;One Canada, One National Economy,&quot; he outlined options for improving Canada&#x27;s existing Agreement on Internal Trade or starting anew with default open market access across Canada for domestic goods and services.

==== Digital Policy ====
While serving as Minister, Moore successfully passed Bill S-4, also known as the &quot;Digital Privacy Act,&quot; a sweeping set of changes to modernize Canada&#x27;s online privacy laws, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). He also implemented a series of spectrum auctions (700 MHz, 2500 MHz and AWS-3) to put as much spectrum into the market for use by wireless providers to create competition. He also established the &quot;Connecting Canadians&quot; program to bring internet connectivity to rural and remote communities, as well as the modernized &quot;Computers for Schools&quot; program for those without access to computers. He also implemented a new cell tower sharing policy to encourage competition and mandatory community consultations on cell tower placement and construction.

==== Space Policy ====
As Minister, Moore developed and implemented a new space policy framework for Canada, including funding and full participation in the James Webb Space Telescope, the international 30 Metre Telescope, renewed membership in the European Space Agency, and a commitment to the International Space Station through 2024 with funding for 2 Canadian astronauts to complete missions to space.

On December 15, 2013 while commenting on a report that B.C. had the worst rate of child poverty in Canada, Moore said, &quot;Is it my job to feed my neighbour&#x27;s child? I don&#x27;t think so&quot; to Vancouver radio station News1130 reporter Sara Norman. His comments were criticized as &quot;dismissive&quot; and Scrooge-like, especially given the Christmas season. Initially the minister denied making any such statement in a series of tweets. On December 16, Moore issued a written apology on his website.

==Out of politics==
On June 19, 2015, Moore announced he was not running as a candidate in the 2015 federal election. In November 2015, it was announced that Moore had been chosen to be the next chancellor of the University of Northern British Columbia, his alma mater, starting a three-year term in May 2016. He also works at the global law firm Dentons as a senior business advisor, and a policy advisor at the global firm Edelman. In September 2016, it was announced that Moore joined the national board of the Canadian Cancer Society as vice chair.

<text>Southern Oregon University (SOU) is a public university in Ashland, Oregon. It was founded in 1872 as the Ashland Academy, has been in its current location since 1926, and was known by nine other names before assuming its current name in 1997. Its Ashland campus – just 14 miles from Oregon&#x27;s border with California – encompasses 175 acres. Five of SOU&#x27;s newest facilities have achieved LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. SOU is headquarters for Jefferson Public Radio and public access station Rogue Valley Community Television. The university has been governed since 2015 by the SOU Board of Trustees.

Southern Oregon University is organized into seven academic divisions: the Oregon Center for the Arts at SOU; Business, Communication and the Environment; Education, Health and Leadership; Humanities and Culture; Social Sciences; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; and Undergraduate Studies. About 90 bachelor&#x27;s degree, graduate and certificate programs are offered. Most of SOU&#x27;s academic programs are on the 10-week quarter system. The university&#x27;s Oregon Center for the Arts enjoys a collaborative relationship with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, located in downtown Ashland.

Southern Oregon University is a member of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.

==History==
Southern Oregon University began as Ashland Academy in 1872, founded by Ashland&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church. The Rev. Joseph Henry Skidmore served as its first president. In 1878, the school was renamed the Ashland Academy and Commercial College, and then renamed Ashland College and Normal School in 1882, Ashland State Normal School in 1886 and Southern Oregon State Normal School in 1895. While Oregon lawmakers designated the institution in 1882 as an official state normal school – a teachers’ college – the state provided no funding. It closed in 1890 and reopened five years later, still relying on tuition and donations for revenue. The Oregon Legislature finally recognized the institution&#x27;s needs in 1897 and approved a first-time appropriation of $7,500. The school flourished, but the legislature reversed course in 1909 and eliminated funding for Oregon&#x27;s normal schools.

Southern Oregon State Normal School closed at the end of the school year and remained shuttered until state funding was reestablished in 1925. The state restarted Southern Oregon State Normal School in Ashland on 24 acres at its current location in 1926. The first building on the new campus was Churchill Hall, named for the college&#x27;s president, Julius A. Churchill. Ashland residents passed the &quot;Normal School Site Bonds&quot; to purchase the campus property and the legislature approved $175,000 to build the new facility, which now serves as SOU&#x27;s administrative building. Inlow Hall at Eastern Oregon University was built from a copy of the building plans for Churchill Hall, designed by architect John Bennes in the Renaissance style. In 1932, the Oregon State Board of Higher Education renamed the institute Southern Oregon Normal School.

The school&#x27;s speech and drama professor, Angus Bowmer, staged a Fourth of July production of Shakespeare&#x27;s “Merchant of Venice” in 1935, launching what would become the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

The college received full accreditation from the American Association of Teachers Colleges in 1939, and Oregon Governor Charles A. Sprague signed a bill changing the institution&#x27;s name to Southern Oregon College of Education.

Elmo Stevenson – for whom the Stevenson Union would later be named – took over as president in 1946 and rebuilt the school&#x27;s enrollment from a low of 45 at the close of World War II to nearly 800 less than three years after his arrival. He became the institution&#x27;s longest-serving president to date, retiring in 1969 from what had been renamed Southern Oregon College – to reflect more diverse course offerings – in 1956.

The institution was renamed Southern Oregon State College in 1975 and became Southern Oregon University in 1997. The campus now includes 175 acres with modern facilities, enrollment of more than 6,000 students and more than 1,100 degrees conferred annually.

==Academics==
Southern Oregon University consists of seven academic divisions: the Oregon Center for the Arts at SOU; Business, Communications and the Environment; Education, Health and Leadership; Humanities and Culture; Social Sciences; Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics; and Undergraduate Studies. In addition to the main campus, classes are offered at a Medford facility that SOU shares with Rogue Community College. The Oregon Health &amp; Science University also maintains a school of nursing program at the SOU main campus.

As of the 2019–2020 academic year, three SOU faculty members in three years had been awarded Fulbright scholarships to teach, lecture and conduct research at various institutions worldwide.

Southern Oregon University is the first university in the United States to offer a Transgender Studies Certificate.

On February 9, 2021, Southern Oregon University was named #4 on a ranking of &quot;Most Affordable Online Colleges for Students With Learning Disabilities in 2021.&quot;

==Rogue Community College and Southern Oregon University Higher Education Center==
Southern Oregon University and Rogue Community College worked together to implement the guidelines of the white paper &quot;Annexation of Jackson County to the District of Rogue Community College,&quot; signed on March 6, 1996. During the 1997–99 biennium, Rogue Community College and Southern Oregon University received regional partnership funding from the legislature to jointly launch several new initiatives to provide additional access for a larger number of residents in southern Oregon. Construction on the downtown Medford center broke ground March 2007 and was completed September 2008. The three-story, center includes classrooms, science labs, computer labs, a Prometric Testing Center and the Business Center. The Higher Education Center offers lower- and upper-division level courses, as well as three master&#x27;s degree programs: Master in Business Administration (offered in a cohort format with classes held on Saturdays), Master in Management (courses offered online and at night), and the Master of Arts in Teaching (a two-year, part-time version of the Southern Oregon University one-year Master of Arts in Teaching program).

The presidents of SOU, RCC, Oregon Institute of Technology and Klamath Community College jointly announced in November 2018 their creation of the Southern Oregon Higher Education Consortium. The alliance is intended to streamline students’ educational pathways and address the region&#x27;s specific workforce needs. Separate meetings of academic officers and enrollment leaders from the four institutions are held regularly to discuss complementary academic programs, transfer agreements and other issues of mutual interest.

==Hannon Library==
The library was named after Oregon state senator Lenn Hannon after he secured $20 million in government bonds and $3.5 million in private support. The Hannon Library finished construction in 2005. The Oregon State Board of Higher Education initially named the library The Lenn and Dixie Hannon Library but the facility&#x27;s name was later changed to The Hannon Library. The project almost doubled the size of the existing library and created much-needed room to expand publications and collections. The library also received many technological advancements that provide long-term value for the community.

==Publications==
The Siskiyou&quot;,&quot; a student-edited university paper staffed by student reporters and photographers. It is published online periodically during the academic year. The print edition of The Siskiyou began in 1926, and its editorial staff pioneered the shift to an entirely online student newspaper in January 2012. The Siskiyou received top honors in the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association&#x27;s Collegiate Newspaper Contest in 2009 and 2018.

SOU News, an online “news portal” managed by the university&#x27;s Marketing and Communications office, launched in September 2018. It publishes several staff-written stories each week about SOU news and events, and provides daily links to stories about SOU from external media.

==Campus life==
Many of the majors offered at the university have associated clubs. There are clubs for hobbies, sports and music, and for support for multiculturalism. Southern Oregon University students are involved in community arts. &quot;Outside&quot; magazine rated Southern Oregon University one of the top 20 schools in the U.S. where students can hit the books and the backcountry.

The &quot;Princeton Review&quot; named SOU one of the most environmentally responsible colleges in the U.S. and Canada. SOU became the original Bee Campus USA in 2015 and in 2018 it was named the nation&#x27;s top pollinator-friendly college by the Sierra Club, as part of its annual “Cool Schools” rankings. The university was recognized by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities as the 2019 recipient of AASCU&#x27;s Excellence and Innovation Award for comprehensive sustainability and sustainable development.

Student activities and support are supplemented by a number of resource centers on campus. The Women&#x27;s Resource Center, Student Sustainability Center, Commuter Resource Center and Queer Resource Center all provide services, resources and events for their respective communities. The university is represented on the board of directors of the Oregon Student Association and SOU&#x27;s own 15-member Board of Trustees includes one student member.

There are several residence halls on campus, as well as family housing complexes.

* The newest residence hall complex on campus is Raider Village, which includes Shasta and McLoughlin halls, and The Hawk dining commons. The state-of-the-art facility, which was completed in 2013, achieved LEED Gold certification for sustainability.
* The adjacent Greensprings Complex consists of four halls: Applegate, Bear Creek, Crater Lake and Deschutes. The four halls, built in the 1970s, are centered around a large lounge. Greensprings residents share The Hawk dining commons with residents from Shasta and McLoughlin halls.
* Madrone Hall consists of 24 four-bedroom suites, each with two bathrooms, a common kitchen and furnished living room. The Madrone Apartments opened in September 2005.
* Student Apartments and Family Housing is located two blocks from campus and houses more than 200 students, faculty, staff and their families. Units in the Quincy Apartments and Wightman Apartments range from 450-square-foot studios to 1,518-square-foot, four-bedroom units. The university also has houses that are available to qualified students.
* The oldest residence hall on campus that is still in regular use is Madrone Hall. 
* Susanne Homes (Suzy) is now home to the Honors College, Community of Recovery in Education (CORE) program and SOU&#x27;s McNair Scholars Program. The main area of the building, called &quot;the Fishbowl,&quot; is used by all four groups.

==Athletics==
The Southern Oregon athletic teams are called the Raiders. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) for most of its sports since the 1993–94 academic year; while its football team competes in the Frontier Conference, and its wrestling team competes as an Independent.

Southern Oregon competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, cycling, football, golf, soccer, track &amp; field and wrestling; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cheerleading, cross country, cycling, dance, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field, volleyball and wrestling. Club sports include baseball, crew, judo, lacrosse, rugby, skiing, men&#x27;s soccer, swimming, men&#x27;s tennis and ultimate frisbee.

<text>Something Big is a 1971 American Western comedy film directed by Andrew V. McLaglen. Produced by McLaglen and screenwriter James Lee Barrett, the film stars Dean Martin, Honor Blackman and Brian Keith.

==Plot==
In the frontier of New Mexico Territory, Joe Baker is an aging bandit determined to do &quot;something big&quot; before his fiancée Dover McBride arrives from the Eastern United States. Dover&#x27;s brother Tommy is a partner in Baker&#x27;s banditry.

Baker must deal with outlaw Jonny Cobb and his ruthless sidekick Angel Moon, while also opposing his plan is the cantankerous Colonel Morgan, who is about to retire from the U.S. Army command in the territory while his wife Mary Anna is arriving from the East to accompany him home.

Colonel Morgan learns from his Indian scout Bookbinder that Baker is planning something but cannot learn details. Actually it is to attack and rob a bandit hoard just across the border in Mexico. The treasure being well guarded, Baker makes a deal with Cobb to purchase a Gatling gun in exchange for a woman. Then Baker receives a letter from his fiancée informing him of her imminent arrival, which sets a deadline on the achievement of his &quot;something big.&quot;

Baker&#x27;s gang holds up a series of stagecoaches, but in each he is unable to find a woman suitable for Cobb and lets the passengers go unmolested. He is finally able to find a worthy candidate, who turns out to be Colonel Morgan&#x27;s wife. She quickly learns to like Baker because he treats her with respect. But the abduction of his wife enrages Morgan, who sets off with a patrol to rescue her and capture Baker.

Cobb and sidekick Moon meet the trader Malachi Morton in the desert to buy the gun, which has been stolen from a federal arsenal. When the trader demands more than what they agreed, Moon hurls his knife into Morton&#x27;s chest, instantly killing him. Before they can meet Baker for the handover, however, they are accosted by Morgan and his scout Bookbinder, who agree to let the bandits go if they reveal Baker&#x27;s location.

Baker&#x27;s fiancé Dover arrives at the fort and installs herself in Morgan&#x27;s quarters. Hearing of her arrival, Baker agrees to meet her in the desert. She gives him an ultimatum to go home with her immediately after achieving his plan or she will marry someone else.

The night before the supposed rendezvous with Cobb to purchase the gun, Baker realizes he is in love with Mary Anna. He attempts to kiss her, but she rebuffs him, stating she is in love with her husband. Nevertheless, Baker tells Tommy that he intends to take the gun from Cobb without giving Mary Anna to him.

Morgan and his scout, with Cobb, Moon and the gun in tow, arrive at Baker&#x27;s hideout and Angel Moon is killed when he attempts to kill Baker. Morgan proceeds to attack Baker with his fists but stops when his wife says how well Baker has treated her. And when he refuses to give Baker the gun, his wife reminds him that he is now officially retired and no longer has the authority to seize the gun as federal property.

Cobb realizes he is not going to get his woman and breaks down, but Morgan realizes that there is a solution, namely a pair of lonely women that he and Bookbinder had encountered earlier. When Cobb arrives, the women roughly throw him off his horse and gleefully drag him to their shack.

Baker and his men assault the bandit&#x27;s town in Mexico, with the help of the Apache allies they have previously paid with whiskey. They are informed that the notorious bandit Emilio Estevez is now a monk. Baker suspects a ruse and pulls open the monk&#x27;s robe, revealing a pistol. A gun battle erupts which the outnumbered Baker is losing until he mounts the wagon with the Gatling gun and mows down the opposition. Baker finds the bandit&#x27;s treasure in the town church, but as his men celebrate their riches, he is haunted by Dover’s parting words.

Back at the fort, Morgan receives an emotional farewell from his assembled troops. Baker, Dover, Morgan and Mary Anna board the stagecoach to return to the East. As they ride out, Baker climbs out on top and drinks to the health of his men riding alongside.

==Cast==

==Reception==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found it perversely humorous: &quot;Like being stuck on a subway, or bearing witness to a mugging on the other side of the street, watching &quot;Something Big&quot; is a group experience of a contemporary, if secondary, order. ... Mr. Martin grins his way through it, wearing an extremely handsome, well-cut suede coat. He is the centerpiece of a fiction that occasionally recalls the sentimentality of John Ford, with mock seriousness, as well as the inane cheeriness of those TV Westerns whose heroes never die, but just go into reruns.&quot;

<doc id="574732" wikidata="Q1526111" url="?curid=574732" title="Xitami">
<text>Xitami is a Web and FTP server, originally developed by iMatix Corporation as a free, open-source product from 1996 to 2000. It ran as a single process with a small footprint. It was not as fast as the fastest servers but scaled well. It supported several web application protocols and was very portable. It also had a web interface to configure the web/FTP server.

In 2009, iMatix launched a new version of Xitami, called X5 (Xitami/5).

== iMatix, developer of Xitami ==
iMatix is a firm that produced free software applications, such as the ZeroMQ high performance message library, the OpenAMQ AMQP messaging service, Libero, the GSL code generator. Hintjens was CEO and chief software designer for it.

== History ==
iMatix started the original Xitami server in 1996 as a demonstration of its &quot;SMT&quot; multithreading technology for building protocol servers. The name was chosen at the last minute when the developers realized that their original choice (&quot;Cosmos&quot;) had already been taken by another web server that no longer exists. &quot;Xitami&quot; is &quot;iMatix&quot; spelled backwards.

Xitami was featured in an April 1997 article in Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal.
The web server attracted people looking for a fast but simple web/FTP server, mainly on Microsoft Windows.

Xitami was designed to be portable, and was ported to Windows, Linux and other Unices, OpenVMS, BeOS, and OS/2. All non-portable functionality was encapsulated in a library layer called SFL (the &quot;standard function library&quot;). SFL was a free and open source project and was used fairly widely in other such projects. In 1999, the Apache web server adopted a similar approach to portability for Apache2, building the Apache Portable Runtime (APR).

The Xitami team continued to add features until mid-2000 when development of the server stopped except for security updates. In 2008 multiple codice_1 vulnerabilities were reported in the final release of Xitami/2.5.

== X5 ==
In January 2009 iMatix announced the start of a new Xitami project, version 5, called &quot;X5&quot;. This uses the latest generation of iMatix&#x27;s multithreading technology (&quot;Base2&quot;), making Xitami scalable to multiple cores, while remaining small, and simple. iMatix has stated that it is &quot;designed to handle thousands of connections without difficulty&quot; which makes it ready for long polling, in which client connections remain open for extended durations.
Windows binaries for X5 were released in February 2009 and X5 was used for the first time to run the iMatix Live Zyre website.
X5 shares the same technical framework as iMatix&#x27;s OpenAMQ message service.

X5 is written in ANSI C99, using a meta-programming approach called &quot;Model Oriented Programming&quot;. X5 was presented at FOSDEM 2009 as consisting of 3,457 lines of meta-meta code.
X5 uses APR in place of SFL, and has been run on Windows, Linux, AIX, Solaris, and OpenVMS.

<doc id="574742" wikidata="Q101609" url="?curid=574742" title="Twelve Olympians">
<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, the twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon, commonly considered to be Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter, Aphrodite, Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes, and either Hestia or Dionysus. They were called &quot;Olympians&quot; because, according to tradition, they resided on Mount Olympus.

Besides the twelve Olympians, there were many other cultic groupings of twelve gods.

==Olympians==
The Olympians are a race of deities, primarily consisting of a third and fourth generation of immortal beings, worshipped as the principal gods of the Greek pantheon and so named because of their residency atop Mount Olympus. They gained their supremacy in a ten-year-long war of gods, in which Zeus led his siblings to victory over the previous generation of ruling immortal beings, the Titans, children of the primordial deities Gaia and Uranus. They were a family of gods, the most important consisting of the first generation of Olympians, offspring of the Titans Cronus and Rhea: Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Demeter and Hestia, along with the principal offspring of Zeus: Aphrodite, Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Ares, Hephaestus, Hermes and Dionysus. Although Hades was a major deity in the Greek pantheon and was the brother of Zeus and the other first generation of Olympians, his realm was far away from Olympus in the underworld, and thus he was not usually considered to be one of the Olympians. Olympic gods can be contrasted to chthonic gods including Hades and his wife Persephone, by mode of sacrifice, the latter receiving sacrifices in a &quot;bothros&quot; (, &quot;pit&quot;) or &quot;megaron&quot; (, &quot;sunken chamber&quot;) rather than at an altar.

The canonical number of Olympian gods was twelve, but besides the (thirteen) principal Olympians listed above, there were many other residents of Olympus, who thus might be considered to be Olympians. Heracles became a resident of Olympus after his apotheosis and married another Olympian resident Hebe. According to Diodorus Siculus, some said that Heracles was offered a place among the twelve, but refused as it would mean one of the original twelve being &quot;cast out&quot;. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the goddess Themis, who is listed among the twelve Titans, dwells on Olympus alongside the other gods, making her a Titan and an Olympian at the same time. According to Hesiod, the children of Styx—Zelus (Envy), Nike (Victory), Kratos (Strength), and Bia (Force)—&quot;have no house apart from Zeus, nor any dwelling nor path except that wherein God leads them, but they dwell always with Zeus&quot;. Some others who might be considered Olympians include the Horae, the Graces, the Muses, Eileithyia, Iris, Dione, and Ganymede.

==Twelve gods==
Besides the twelve Olympians, there were many other various cultic groupings of twelve gods throughout ancient Greece. The earliest evidence of Greek religious practice involving twelve gods (Greek: , , from , &quot;twelve&quot;, and , &quot;gods&quot;) comes no earlier than the late sixth century BC. According to Thucydides, an altar of the twelve gods was established in the agora of Athens by the archon Pisistratus (son of Hippias and the grandson of the tyrant Pisistratus), around 522 BC. The altar became the central point from which distances from Athens were measured and a place of supplication and refuge.

Olympia apparently also had an early tradition of twelve gods. The &quot;Homeric Hymn to Hermes&quot; () has the god Hermes divide a sacrifice of two cows he has stolen from Apollo, into twelve parts, on the banks of the river Alpheus (presumably at Olympia):
Pindar, in an ode written to be sung at Olympia c. 480 BC, has Heracles sacrificing, alongside the Alpheus, to the &quot;twelve ruling gods&quot;:
Another of Pindar&#x27;s Olympian odes mentions &quot;six double altars&quot;. Herodorus of Heraclea (c. 400 BC) also has Heracles founding a shrine at Olympia, with six pairs of gods, each pair sharing a single altar.

Many other places had cults of the twelve gods, including Delos, Chalcedon, Magnesia on the Maeander, and Leontinoi in Sicily. As with the twelve Olympians, although the number of gods was fixed at twelve, the membership varied. While the majority of the gods included as members of these other cults of twelve gods were Olympians, non-Olympians were also sometimes included. For example, Herodorus of Heraclea identified the six pairs of gods at Olympia as: Zeus and Poseidon, Hera and Athena, Hermes and Apollo, the Graces and Dionysus, Artemis and Alpheus, and Cronus and Rhea. Thus, while this list includes the eight Olympians: Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Athena, Hermes, Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysus, it also contains three clear non-Olympians: the Titan parents of the first generation of Olympians, Cronus and Rhea, and the river god Alpheus, with the status of the Graces (here apparently counted as one god) being unclear.

Plato connected &quot;twelve gods&quot; with the twelve months and implies that he considered Pluto (Or Hades) one of the twelve in proposing that the final month be devoted to him and the spirits of the dead.

The Roman poet Ennius gives the Roman equivalents (the ) as six male-female complements, preserving the place of Vesta (Greek Hestia), who played a crucial role in Roman religion as a state goddess maintained by the Vestals.

<text>Woodsman (also, woodsmen, pl.) refers to the title of competitors participating in competitive timber sports. Woodsmen participate in various events that replicate real skills used by lumberjacks while cutting down trees and preparing the wood. Woodsman Competitions are a competitive, co-ed intercollegiate sport in the United States, Canada and elsewhere based on various skills traditionally part of forestry educational and technical training programs. In these competitions participants use various tools, such as racing axes, throwing axes, cross-cut saws, and chainsaws. In North America, the sport currently is organized in five regional divisions: northeastern, mid-Atlantic, southern, midwestern, and western.

==History==
Woodsmen or lumberjack competitions have their roots in competitions that took place in logging camps among loggers. As loggers were paid for piece work, the ability to perform a specific task more quickly, or with a degree of showmanship, was something to be admired. Today the tradition survives on college campuses across Canada and the United States, as well as on various competitive circuits worldwide, including ESPN&#x27;s now-defunct Great Outdoor Games. The sport is most popular in areas of the world with a strong logging tradition.

==Competitive structure==
Unlike many college sports which have some degree of seasonality, members of collegiate woodsman teams compete throughout the academic year. Competitions typically take the form of a &quot;meet&quot;, a series of events run throughout the day of competition. Meets may take place outdoors or inside a suitably large structure to safely accommodate the potentially dangerous tools used. An entry fee is charged to cover the cost of providing timber, awards, and food.

Schools compete in teams of six. A school has the option to send multiple teams, each of which pays an entry fee. Events are divided among team members at the discretion of the entering schools. There are, however, a series of team events in which every member is expected to participate fully. Men and Women&#x27;s team typically utilize the same equipment, however in competition some rules are adjusted by gender. If a school chooses to send a mixed-gender, or Jack and Jill team, Men&#x27;s rules apply. Each team is coordinated by a captain.

Events may be run as single, double, triple or team events at the discretion of the hosting school. The list and structure of the competition is typically published beforehand in order to allow team members to prepare for their assigned events.

===Scoring===

Most events are scored based on the time taken by the competitor to complete. Teams are scored as a whole, and each event is generally weighted equally. A point system for scoring may be used, where the first place competitor is awarded 100 points, and runners-up receive a percentage of the winner&#x27;s score based on their performance in comparison. A second system calculates a winning team&#x27;s place based solely on placement, and does not take into consideration the spread between each team&#x27;s performance.

==Events==
The following is a list of typical events run at collegiate woodsmen competitions:

===Axe throw===
This event requires a thrower to place a double-bit Axe as close to the center of a target as possible from a set distance away. The axe is released in such a way that it rotates about the midpoint of the handle and, ideally, contacts the center of the target with only one edge. Scores are awarded from 1-3 or 1-5 points (depending on the target), with the highest score being a bulls-eye. Competitors are given three practice throws and three scored throws. A hit which crosses a line from one ring into the next is typically awarded the higher score. If an axe should contact the target with both edges, such that the handle sticks straight out, the handle is tapped downward until only one edge makes contact, which is used to calculate the score. If, during this process, the axe falls from the target, no points are awarded.

===Splitting===
Splitting can take several forms, but is typically performed with one or more bolts of hardwood and as a single, double or triples event. Splitting axes in the 4-6 pound range are used, and mauls are typically prohibited as they provide a sizable competitive advantage. Logs are always placed on the ground, and occasionally within a car tire to prevent a clumsy competitor from accidentally striking their own feet or legs with the axe. Points are awarded for the time to complete the event, and penalties are assessed for incomplete splits, where fibers still connect pieces of split wood together.

* The &quot;Dot Split&quot; version of the event involves a two-inch dot placed at the top of each bolt, normally at the natural, rather than the geometric center of the log. The competitor is required to split the log into four full-length pieces, each having some amount of paint present on the end.
*The barrel split event requires a bolt to be split into numerous pieces and inserted into an opening in the top of a barrel, which is usually 6-8 inches wide. The event ends when all pieces have been completely inserted.

===Wood chopping===


====Underhand chop====

The Underhand, or horizontal chop is an axe event which involves cutting a bolt of wood set horizontally in a stanchion into two pieces. The event is scored for time. During the event, the competitor stands on top of a log set horizontally in a stanchion. The competitor swings the axe between their feet at a 45 degree angle on two opposing faces, opening up a face that extends halfway through the diameter of the log. The competitor then switches sides and severs the log by opening a face on the opposite side, working only on the second side until the two meet.

====Standing block chop====

The mechanics of wood removal for the Standing Block or Vertical chop are similar to those of the underhand, however, because the log is set vertically, the technique involved is different from the underhand chop. A competitor must angle their axe swings to open a face at 45 degrees skyward, and at 45 degrees below the horizontal in order to create the same two faces that are needed to chop one side of the log.

====Hard hit chopping====

This event is a variation on the underhand chop which scores a competitor not on time, but on the number of axe swings needed to sever the log. The least amount of swings used to cut through the log determines the winner. If two contestants tie, then time is taken into consideration, and whomever completed the log faster wins.

==== Bow saw ====

The Bow Saw event is most typically run as a singles or as a team event. A 36-inch bow saw fitted with a competition-grade peg and raker blade is most frequently used. In a singles event, a competitor is typically asked to cut a series of thin slices, called cookies, from a log, which is chained down to a stanchion. Each disk of wood sawn must be complete, or a penalty is assessed. As a team event, each member cuts one or two disks, and team members switch after completing their cuts. This event is scored for total time to complete all cuts.

==== Crosscut sawing ====

This event is run as either a doubles or team event. As a crosscut saw is a two-man saw, each cut must be made with a pair of teammates. A series of cookies are sawed off for time, as in the bow saw event. The saws used for these events tend to be the most expensive individual pieces of equipment for a woodsman team, running into thousands of dollars for a competition-filed peg and raker or M tooth saw. Great pains are taken before the event is run to examine the log being cut for knots or imperfections which can damage these very expensive and delicate instruments.

=== Jack and Jill ===
Jack and Jill is a double crosscut saw event that has one male and one female participant following the same rules as the two-man saw. The name originates from the male term lumberjack and the female term .

==== Single buck ====

The single buck event utilizes a two-man crosscut saw operated by one individual, and is almost universally run as a singles event. The saw is typically of the same grade as the crosscut saw used in the two man event, but may be custom filed for one person operation. The competitor is required to make a single cut or cookie through one large log. These logs are typically the largest diameter wood present at the competition. A competitor is allowed a starting cut, usually measured to be no more than 6-8 inches, or the width of a US One Dollar bill. A teammate is allowed to straddle the log and place a wedge to ease the competitor&#x27;s progress and prevent binding of the saw.

===Chainsaw events===

==== Stock saw ====
This event is scored for time. A competitor wearing appropriate safety gear makes a series of cuts in a log. The event can be designed in various ways to emphasize visual accuracy or the ability to run their chainsaw at the peak of its power band. In the interest of fairness, the same saw is typically used throughout the day to eliminate any variables between saws (which can be significant, even for the same model saw).

* The &quot;Down Up&quot; version of the event requires a cut downward (on a pulling chain, using the bottom of the bar) followed by an upward cut (on a pushing chain, using the top of the bar). This is by far the most common version of the event.
* The &quot;Down Up Down&quot; event adds an additional down cut to the above.
* The &quot;Up Down&quot; event typically involves a cut halfway up a log, which then requires that the competitor remove their saw from the log and complete the cut from the top of the log. This version of the event is timed with an accuracy component based on how closely the two half-cuts met. This version is rarely seen in current competitions.

==== Disk stack ====

The chainsaw Disk Stack event involves cutting a series of stacked disks from a log set vertically in a stanchion. A competitor is given a set area of wood to cut, and a time limit, usually two minutes. Holding the saw at eye level, the competitor saws off successive disks, leaving previous cuts stacked on top of the log. The event is scored based on the number of whole disks left on top of the log at the time the competitor announces they are done. Time is used as a secondary tie-breaker. Performed well, it is not unusual for a competitor to cut in excess of 20 disks. During the event, the competitor is not allowed to manipulate the disks in any fashion other than sawing off additional disks.

=== Obstacle pole ===

The mechanics of the Obstacle Pole simulate a fallen tree. The pole is 25 feet long, one end is in the dirt and the other is raised 4-5 feet off the ground. The participants are timed, and whoever can run from the tip of the pole to the base, up the length of the pole as it ascends in elevation, and cut the end of the pole off with a chainsaw, without falling, is the winner. The chainsaw is only allowed to be running in the last 5 feet of the pole and is indicated by a line painted on the pole. The runner must also enter the climb of the pole behind a marked line at the base, which indicates participants must place one whole foot behind the line before they begin their climb.

===Pulpwood toss===

The pulpwood toss event is typically run as a team event, and requires all competitors to throw a set of four pieces of pulpwood between two pairs of stakes, typically set 15–20 feet apart. The event is typically timed until 48 qualifying pieces of pulpwood have been thrown. A piece of wood earns a point toward the 48 possible points if it breaks the plane between the two stakes after the competitor is done throwing. This means that pulpwood thrown too far, not far enough, or not between the stakes is not counted. Sticks which a competitor can knock into place with subsequent throws are counted.

===Log rolling and decking===

Log rolling or log decking (not to be confused with birling) are two events that involve the use of peaveys and a pair of competitors to maneuver a log to a set destination. In log decking, the competitors must push the log along a track of wooden beams and usually up to the top of a ramp. In log rolling, the competitors may either have a straight course or a course which requires a series of turns in order to maneuver a log to its finish line along the ground. This event is typically run as either a doubles or team event.

=== Choker race ===
A timed race where participants navigate an obstacle course carrying a metal wire choker cable (couldn&#x27;t find sources that were not selling the product but would have linked it regardless). Participants start the race by unbuckling the choker, they then run through the customized obstacle course and finish by looping it around a large log, imitating strapping choker cables to logs in wood production for transport. The participants must wear gloves and a helmet, as the loose cable can weigh more than 40 pounds. There is no standardization for the orientation of the obstacle course and is left up to the venue. Courses must allow at least 12 feet wide of room for participants, and the course has limitations for difficulty and safety.  

===Birling===
This event traditionally involves two competitors, each on one end of a free-floating log in a body of water. The athletes battle to stay on the log by sprinting, kicking the log, and using a variety of techniques as they attempt to cause the opponent to fall off. Due to a lack of a body of water nearby, some schools will use a swimming pool to house a log or build a &quot;dry birling&quot; station using a log on a spindle, allowing it to spin freely. Some schools will run this event in a tournament style, while others will time how long a competitor is able to stay on the log or count the number of revolutions completed within a time limit due to safety concerns.

===Pole climbing===
This event involves a harnessed and belayed climber getting to the top of a featureless pole as quickly as possible. The pole is typically the size of a standard telephone pole, and the climber wears homemade spikes in order to make rapid upward progress.

===Fire build===

The Fire Build event involves making a fire using a tool, a piece of dried wood, and strike anywhere matches. A can of soapy water is placed on top of the fire, and time is called for the event when the can boils over. The event may be run with one or two competitors and using one or two tools. When two tools are used, one tool is usually a hatchet or small axe, and the second tool is a knife. The event is scored for time.

==Culture==
The culture on teams which participate in woodsmen competitions varies widely from that of a drinking club with chainsaws to a school sanctioned varsity sport with all the associated visibility and expectations thereof. The sport has been co-educational for all of recent memory, and female competitors are for the most part given equal treatment to men, though the professional circuit has largely chosen to ignore women. Fraternization among team members is frequent.

The atmosphere at a woodsmen meet oscillates between the seriousness competition and the friendly environment of the county fair. Competitors practice specific events for weeks and months, gaining efficiency and power in every movement. The selection of equipment is not something to be taken lightly, given its considerable cost, and each piece of wood is scrutinized for imperfections and knots that might interfere with its eventual bifurcation. The weight of pulp may need to be judged solely by sight, and insights into the quirks of a log roll log can be garnered from watching other competitors.

On the lighter side, these events are frequently attended by friends and family, who mingle freely with the woodsmen. Actual hostility between teams is rare and most competitors come to know each other by name. Booing is unheard of at woodsmen competitions: competitors cheer loudly for their own team members and for members of other teams. Those competitors that finish last are urged on until the event is completed. As competitors rarely have any experience in woodsmen before entering college competition, novice competitors are actively recruited from students with no previous wood chopping experience.

==Equipment==
In woodsmen competitions, the required equipment consists of cross-cut saws, bow saws, axes, peaveys, helmets, gloves, foot and leg protection, and climbing gear for the pole climb.

Common types of saws include the M-Tooth and the Peg and Raker. Most beginners will start on an M-Tooth because it is a more forgiving saw and move up to a Peg and Raker as they improve. Competition bow saws, unlike commercial bow saws, have frames and blades that are 42&quot; long. Many different grinds and makes of competition axes are available, with some of the more popular types including Tuatara, Keech, and Brute Force.

For Horizontal Speed chop, Hard hit, and vertical speed chop and hard hit, heavier, and sharper race axes are used. These Axes have a broader face, with more edge to cut into the wood, and are often sharpened more than an average splitting axe. The origins and design of racing axes come from the single–bit felling ax, or American ax, a standard felling axe used in field work since the late 18th century.

<doc id="574751" wikidata="Q298180" url="?curid=574751" title="Simone Veil">
<text>Simone Veil (; ; 13 July 1927 – 30 June 2017) was a French magistrate, Holocaust survivor, and politician who served as Health Minister in several governments and was President of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1982, the first woman to hold that office. As health minister, she is best remembered for advancing women&#x27;s rights in France, in particular for the 1975 law that legalized abortion, today known as the &quot;Veil Act&quot; (). From 1998 to 2007, she was a member of the Constitutional Council, France&#x27;s highest legal authority.

A Holocaust survivor of both Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen, she was a firm believer in European integration as a way of guaranteeing peace. She served as president of the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah from 2000 to 2007, and then as its honorary president. Among many honours, she was made an honorary dame in 1998, was elected to the Académie Française in 2008, and in 2012 received the grand cross of the Légion d’honneur, the highest class of the highest French order of merit.

Among France&#x27;s most revered figures, Simone Veil and her husband were buried at the Panthéon on 1 July 2018. Her eulogy was given by President Emmanuel Macron.

==Early years and family==
Simone Jacob was born on 13 July 1927 to an atheist Jewish family in Nice. Her father André Jacob was an architect who graduated from the Beaux-Arts de Paris and went on to win the Prix de Rome for Architecture. In 1922 he married Yvonne Steinmetz, who had just passed her Baccalauréat and was about to start studying chemistry. André Jacob insisted that she abandon her studies upon marriage. The family had moved from Paris to Nice in 1924, hoping to benefit from construction projects on the Côte d’Azur. Simone was the youngest of four siblings, Madeleine (nicknamed Milou), born in 1923; Denise, born in 1924 and Jean, born in 1925. 
Her father&#x27;s family had come from Lorraine, while her mother’s side came from the Rhineland region and from Belgium.

Simone&#x27;s family was explicitly Jewish but non-practicing. &quot;Being a member of the Jewish community was never a problem. It was proudly claimed by my father, but for cultural reasons, not religious ones,&quot; she wrote in her autobiography. &quot;In his eyes, if the Jewish people were to remain the chosen people, it was because they were the people of the Book, the people of thinking and writing.&quot;

===Deportation===
When Germany invaded France and the Vichy regime came to power in June 1940, the family managed to avoid being deported, as Nice had been included in the Italian occupation zone. Asked not to come to school by its superintendent, Simone Jacob had to study at home. As the round-up of Jews intensified, the family split up and lived with different friends under false identities. Denise left for Lyon to join the resistance, while 16-year-old Simone continued studying and passed her baccalauréat exam under her real name in March 1944. The next day she was arrested by the Gestapo on her way out to meet friends and celebrate the end of her secondary education. The rest of her family was also arrested on that day.

On 7 April 1944, Simone, her mother, and her sisters were sent to the transit camp of Drancy, then on 13 April were deported to Auschwitz in Convoy 71. Simone’s brother and father were deported to the Baltic states in Convoy 73, never to be seen again, and thus assumed to have been murdered. Her sister Denise was deported to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, which she survived, and after the end of World War II in Europe was reunited with Simone.

On 15 April 1944, Simone Jacob arrived at Auschwitz. She later wrote that she managed to avoid the gas chamber by lying about her age and was registered for the labour camp. In January 1945, Simone, along with her mother and sister, was sent on a march to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where her mother died of typhus. Madeleine also fell ill but, like Simone, was saved when the camp was liberated on 15 April 1945. 

===Return to France===
Simone Jacob returned to France and started studying law at the University of Paris before going to the Institut d&#x27;études politiques, where she met Antoine Veil. The couple married on 26 October 1946, and would go on to have three sons, Jean, Nicolas, and Pierre-François. They moved to live in the American occupation zone in Germany. In 1952, Madeleine Jacob died with her son in a car accident after visiting Simone in Stuttgart.

==Political career==
===Ministry of Justice, 1956–1974===
After graduating from the Faculty of Law of Paris with a law degree, Veil spent several years practising law. In 1954, she passed the national examination to become a magistrate. She entered the National Penitentiary Administration under the Ministry of Justice, where she held a senior position and was responsible for judicial affairs. She improved women&#x27;s prison conditions and the treatment of incarcerated women. In 1964, she left to become the director of civil affairs, where she improved French women&#x27;s general rights and status. She successfully achieved the right to dual parental control of family legal matters and adoptive rights for women. In 1970, she became secretary general of the .

===Minister of Health, 1974–1979===
From 1974 to 1979, Veil was a Minister of Health in the governments of prime ministers Jacques Chirac and Raymond Barre: from 28 May 1974 to 29 March 1977, Minister of Health; from 29 March 1977 to 3 April 1978, Minister of Health and Social Security; and from 3 April 1978 to 4 July 1979, Minister of Health and Family.

She pushed forward two notable laws. The first, passed on 4 December 1974, facilitated access to contraception such as the combined oral contraceptive pill, which was legalized in 1967.

The second, passed on 17 January 1975, legalized abortion in France – this was her hardest-fought political initiative and the one for which she is best known. The abortion debate was particularly difficult for her because those in favour of keeping abortion illegal launched aggressive personal attacks against Veil and her family. Since the passing of the law, many have paid tribute to Veil and thanked her for her courageous and determined fight.

In 1976, Veil also helped to introduce a ban on smoking in certain public places and worked on the problem of medically underserved rural areas.

===European Parliament, 1979–1993===
In 1979, Veil was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in the first European parliamentary election. In its first session, the new Parliament elected Veil as its first President, a position she held until 1982. The archives concerning her term as President of the European Parliament are deposited at the Historical Archives of the European Union in Florence.

In 1981, Veil won the prestigious Charlemagne Prize, an award given to honour the contributions made by individuals to advancing the unity of Europe.

After the end of her term as President in 1982, she remained a member of the European Parliament; she was re-elected for the last time in the 1989 election, stepping down in 1993. She was Chair of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party until 1989.

Between 1984 and 1992, she served on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and the Committee on Political Affairs. After stepping down from these committees, she served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and its related Subcommittee on Human Rights. Between 1989 and 1993, she was also a member of Parliament&#x27;s delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, serving as its vice-chairwoman until 1992.

===Return to French Government, 1993–1995===
From 31 March 1993 to 16 May 1995, Veil was again a member of the cabinet, serving as Minister of State and Minister of Health, Social Affairs and the city in the government of Prime Minister Édouard Balladur. In the mid-1990s, she worked to help the disabled, HIV-positive patients, and mothers of young children.

===Member of the Constitutional Council, 1998===
In 1998, she was appointed to the Constitutional Council of France. In 2005, she put herself briefly on leave from the council in order to campaign in favour of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe. This action was criticized because it seemed to contradict the legal provisions that members of the council should keep a distance from partisan politics: the independence and impartiality of the council would be jeopardized, critics said, if members could put themselves &quot;on leave&quot; in order to campaign for a project. In response, Veil said that she, the president of the Constitutional Council and colleagues had deliberated on the issue beforehand and they had given her permission to take her leave without having to resign. Being a staunch supporter of the European project, she believed others should not &quot;ignore the historical dimension of European integration&quot;.

==Later life and death==


In 2003, she was elected to the Board of Directors of the International Criminal Court&#x27;s Trust Fund for Victims. 
In 2007, Simone Veil supported presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy. She was by his side on the day after he received 31 per cent of the vote in the first round of the presidential elections that year.

In 2008, Simone Veil became the sixth woman to be elected to the Académie française. She joined the Academy&#x27;s forty &quot;immortals&quot;, as the members are informally known, occupying the 13th seat, once the seat of literary figure Jean Racine. Her induction address was given in March 2010 by Jean d&#x27;Ormesson. On her sword, given to her as to every other immortal, is engraved her Auschwitz number (number 78651), the motto of the French Republic (liberté, égalité, fraternité) and the motto of the European Union, Unity in diversity (Unis dans la diversité).

Veil died at her home on 30 June 2017, at age 89. Her son Jean said at her public ceremony on 5 July, &quot;I forgive you for having poured water over my head&quot;, in reference to an event where she had emptied a carafe of water over his head in disgust at what she considered to be his misogynist remarks.

On 5 July 2017, Veil was honoured with a national ceremony and military honours in les Invalides courtyard, after which she was interred next to her husband, who died in 2013, at Montparnasse Cemetery. The ceremony at les Invalides was attended by President Macron, Holocaust survivors, politicians and dignitaries. In his speech during the ceremony, President Macron announced the decision to rebury Veil and her husband in the Panthéon, which was done on .

== Personal life ==

===The Simone Veil Prize===
In 2018, the government of France established a prize in memory of Veil to honour people who fight for women&#x27;s causes. The intent is to draw attention to efforts to promote women&#x27;s autonomy, education, participation in leadership roles, and freedom from violence and discrimination. The prize is awarded each year on 8 March, International Women&#x27;s Day, with €100,000 to support work in the winner&#x27;s area of concern. On 8 March 2019, the first Simone Veil Prize was awarded to Aissa Doumara Ngatansou, co-founder of the Association for the Elimination of Violence against Women (ALVF) in Cameroon.

<text>Eleanor Gwyn (2 February 1650 – 14 November 1687; also spelled &quot;Gwynn&quot;, &quot;Gwynne&quot;) was an English stage actress and celebrity figure of the Restoration period. Praised by Samuel Pepys for her comic performances as one of the first actresses on the English stage, she became best known for being a longtime mistress of King Charles II of England (c. April 1668 – 6 February 1685).

Called &quot;pretty, witty Nell&quot; by Pepys, she has been regarded as a living embodiment of the spirit of Restoration England, and has come to be considered a folk heroine, with a story echoing the rags-to-royalty tale of Cinderella. Gwyn had two sons by King Charles: Charles Beauclerk (1670–1726) and James Beauclerk (1671–1680). Charles Beauclerk was created Earl of Burford and Duke of St. Albans; Murray de Vere Beauclerk, 14th Duke of St. Albans is her descendant, and the current holder of the duchy.

==Early life==
The details of Gwyn&#x27;s background are somewhat obscure. A horoscope in the Ashmolean manuscripts gives her date of birth as 2 February 1650. On the other hand, an account published in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine and Humorist&quot; in 1838 states that she was born about 1642. The earlier date of birth was asserted without documentation, but various scholars have supported both the earlier and later dates. The eight-year difference between these two possible birth years can offer different readings of what Gwyn achieved during her lifetime.

The obscurity surrounding Gwyn&#x27;s date of birth parallels numerous other obscurities that run through the course of her life. The information we have about Gwyn is collected from various sources, including the plays she starred in, satirical poetry and pictures, diaries, and letters. As such, much of this information is founded on hearsay, gossip, and rumour, and must therefore be handled with caution.

Her mother Ellen (or a variant, being referred to in her lifetime as &quot;Old Madam&quot;, &quot;Madam Gwyn&quot; and &quot;Old Ma Gwyn&quot;) was born, according to a monumental inscription, in the parish of St Martin in the Fields, which stretched from Soho and Covent Garden to beyond Mayfair, and is thought to have lived most of her life there in the West End. Most of her biographers believe her to have been &quot;low-born&quot;. Her descendant and biographer Charles Beauclerk calls this conjecture, based solely on what is known of her later life. Madam Gwyn is sometimes said to have had the maiden surname Smith. This appears to be derived from a fragmentary pedigree by Anthony Wood that shows signs of confusion between different Gwyn families and it has not been firmly established. Nell&#x27;s mother is said to have drowned when she fell into the water at her house near Chelsea. She was buried on 30 July 1679, in her 56th year, at St Martin in the Fields.

Nell Gwyn is reported in a manuscript of 1688 to have been a daughter of &quot;Thos [Thomas] Guine a Capt [captain] of ane antient fammilie in Wales&quot;, but the statement is doubtful as its author does not seem to have hesitated to create or alter details where the facts were unknown or perhaps unremarkable. There is some suggestion, from a poem dated to 1681, again of doubtful accuracy, that Gwyn&#x27;s father died at Oxford, perhaps in prison. It has been suggested, based on the pedigree by Anthony Wood, that Gwyn was a granddaughter of Edward or Edmund Gwyn, Canon of Christ Church from 1615 to 1624. But administration records show that Edmund Gwyn died unmarried. Moreover, Wood did not give a forename for Nell&#x27;s supposed grandfather and there are reasons to think that the &quot;Dr ... Gwyn&quot; in the pedigree was intended to be not Edmund Gwyn but rather his brother Matthew. In either case, the available evidence indicates that Nell was not a member of their family.

Gwyn was assigned arms similar to those of the Gwynnes of Llansannor, but her specific connection to that family, if any, is unknown.

Three cities make the claim to be Gwyn&#x27;s birthplace: Hereford, London (specifically Covent Garden) and Oxford. Evidence for any of the three is scarce. The fact that &quot;Gwyn&quot; is a name of Welsh origin might support Hereford, as its county is on the border with Wales; &quot;The Dictionary of National Biography&quot; notes a traditional belief that she was born there in Pipe Well Lane, renamed Gwynne Street in the 19th century. There is also the legend that Nell Gwyn chose red coats for the pensioners of Chelsea Hospital, which she allegedly influenced King Charles II to found, because she remembered that similar coats had been worn at Coningsby Hospital in Hereford. London is the simplest choice, perhaps, since Gwyn&#x27;s mother was born there and that is where she raised her children. Alexander Smith&#x27;s 1715 &quot;Lives of the Court Beauties&quot; says she was born in Coal Yard Alley in Covent Garden and other biographies, including Wilson&#x27;s, have followed suit. Her noble descendant Beauclerk pieces together circumstantial evidence to favour an Oxford birth.

One way or another, Gwyn&#x27;s father seems to have been out of the picture by the time of her childhood in Covent Garden, and her &quot;dipsomaniac mother, [and] sister&quot;, Rose, were left in a low situation. She experimented with cross-dressing between 1663 and 1667, going under the name &quot;William Nell&quot; and adopting a false beard; her observations informed a most successful and hilarious character interpretation acting as a man on the stage in March 1667. Old Madam Gwyn was by most accounts an alcoholic whose business was running a bawdy house (or brothel). There, or in the bawdy house of one Madam Ross, Nell spent at least some time. It is possible that she herself was a child prostitute; Peter Thomson, in the &quot;Oxford Illustrated History of Theatre&quot;, says it is &quot;probable&quot;. But a rare mention of her upbringing from the source herself might be seen to contradict the idea. A 1667 entry in Pepys&#x27;s diary records, second-hand, that:Here Mrs. Pierce tells me ... that Nelly and Beck Marshall, falling out the other day, the latter called the other my Lord Buckhurst&#x27;s whore. Nell answered then, &quot;I was but one man&#x27;s whore, though I was brought up in a bawdy-house to fill strong waters to the guests; and you are a whore to three or four, though a Presbyter&#x27;s praying daughter!&quot; It is not out of the question that Gwyn was merely echoing the satirists of the day, if she said this at all. 

Various anonymous verses are the only other sources describing her childhood occupations: bawdyhouse servant, street hawker of herring, oysters, or turnips, and cinder-girl have all been put forth. Tradition has her growing up in Coal Yard Alley, a poor slum off Drury Lane.

Around 1662, Nell is said to have taken a lover by the name of Duncan or Dungan. Their relationship lasted perhaps two years, and was reported with obscenity-laced acidity in several later satires; &quot;For either with expense of purse or p---k, / At length the weary fool grew Nelly-sick&quot;. Duncan provided Gwyn with rooms at a tavern in Maypole Alley, and the satires also say he was involved in securing Nell a job at the theatre being built nearby.

During the English Commonwealth era, pastimes regarded as frivolous, including theatre, had been banned. Charles II had been restored to the English throne in 1660, and he reinstated the theatre. One of his early acts as king was to license the formation of two acting companies and to legalise acting as a profession for women. In 1663, the King&#x27;s Company, led by Thomas Killigrew, opened a new playhouse, the Theatre in Bridges/Brydges Street, which was later rebuilt and renamed the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.

Mary Meggs, a former prostitute nicknamed &quot;Orange Moll&quot; and a friend of Madam Gwyn&#x27;s, had been granted the licence to &quot;vend, utter and sell oranges, lemons, fruit, sweetmeats and all manner of fruiterers and confectioners wares&quot; within the theatre. Orange Moll hired Nell and her elder sister Rose as scantily-clad &quot;orange-girls&quot;, selling small, sweet &quot;china&quot; oranges to the audience inside the theatre for a sixpence each. The work exposed her to the theatre and to London&#x27;s higher society: this was &quot;the King&#x27;s playhouse&quot;, and Charles II frequently attended performances. The orange-girls also served as messengers between men in the audience and actresses backstage; they received tips for this role, and some of these messages ended in sexual assignations. Whether this activity rose to the level of pimping may be a matter of semantics.

== Actress ==

The new theatres were the first in England to feature actresses; earlier, women&#x27;s parts had been played by boys or men. Gwyn joined the rank of actresses at Bridges Street when she was 14 (if we take her birth year to be 1650), less than a year after becoming an orange-girl.

If her good looks, strong clear voice, and lively wit were responsible for catching Killigrew&#x27;s eye, she still had to prove herself clever enough to succeed as an actress. This was no easy task in the Restoration theatre; the limited pool of audience members meant that very short runs were the norm for plays and 50 different productions might be mounted in the nine-month season lasting from September to June. She was reputed to have been illiterate.

She was taught her craft of performing at a school for young actors developed by Killigrew and one of the fine male actors of the time, Charles Hart, and learned dancing from another, John Lacy; both were rumoured by satirists of the time to be her lovers, but if she had such a relationship with Lacy (Beauclerk thinks it unlikely), it was kept much more discreet than her well-known affair with Hart.

Much as in the dispute over her date of birth, it is unclear when Gwyn began to perform professionally on the Restoration stage. It is possible that she first appeared in smaller parts during the 1664–65 season. For example, The Bodleian Manuscript of &quot;The Siege of Urbin&quot; has the part of Pedro (Melina- a maid servant in breeches) played by a &#x27;Mrs. Nell&#x27;. Additionally, &#x27;Nelle&#x27; was intended to play the small role of Paulina, a courtesan, in Killigrew&#x27;s &quot;Thomaso, or The Wanderer&quot; in November 1664, but the play seems to have been cancelled. The use of &#x27;Mrs&#x27; would imply that Gwyn was more likely born in 1642 than 1650 as it indicates an actress over the age of 21 (not her marital status) for which certain roles would be more suitable. Nonetheless, since players of less substantial parts are seldom mentioned in cast lists or playgoers&#x27; diaries of the period, an absolute date for Gywn&#x27;s debut cannot be ascertained.

Whatever her first role as an actress may have been, it is evident that she had become a more prominent actress by 1665. It is around this time when she is first mentioned in Pepys&#x27;s diary, specifically on 3 April 1665, while attending a play, where the description &#x27;pretty, witty Nell&#x27; is first recorded. This unusual use of only her first name implies that Gwyn had made herself known both on the stage and off as her celebrity status started to emerge. Her first recorded appearance onstage was in March 1665, in John Dryden&#x27;s heroic drama &quot;The Indian Emperour&quot;, playing Cydaria, daughter of Moctezuma and love interest to Cortez, played by her real-life lover Charles Hart.

Pepys, whose diary usually has great things to say about Gwyn, was displeased with her performance in this same part two years later: &quot;to the King&#x27;s playhouse, and there saw &#x27;The Indian Emperour;&#x27; where I find Nell come again, which I am glad of; but was most infinitely displeased with her being put to act the Emperour&#x27;s daughter; which is a great and serious part, which she do most basely.&quot;

Gwyn seems to have agreed that drama did not suit her, judging by the lines she was later made to say in the epilogue to a Robert Howard drama:
We have been all ill-us&#x27;d, by this day&#x27;s poet.&#x27;Tis our joint cause; I know you in your heartsHate serious plays, as I do serious parts.
It was in the new form of restoration comedy that Gwyn became a star. In May 1665, she appeared opposite Hart in James Howard&#x27;s comedy &quot;All Mistaken, or the Mad Couple&quot;.

There is some debate over the year &quot;The Mad Couple&quot; debuted, with earlier authorities believing it to be 1667. This was the first of many appearances in which Gwyn and Hart played the &quot;gay couple&quot;, a form that would become a frequent theme in restoration comedies. The gay couple, broadly defined, is a pair of witty, antagonistic lovers, he generally a rake fearing the entrapment of marriage and she feigning to do the same in order to keep her lover at arm&#x27;s length. Theatre historian Elizabeth Howe credits the gay couple&#x27;s enduring success on the Restoration stage entirely to &quot;the talent and popularity of a single actress, Nell Gwyn&quot;.

The Great Plague of London shut down the Bridges Street theatre, along with most of the city, from mid-1665 until late 1666. Gwyn and her mother spent some of this time in Oxford, following the King and his court. The King&#x27;s Company is presumed to have mounted some private theatrical entertainments for the court during this time away from the virulent capital. Gwyn and the other ten &quot;women comedians in His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre&quot; were issued the right (and the cloth) to wear the King&#x27;s livery at the start of this exile, proclaiming them official servants of the King.

After the theatres reopened, Gwyn and Hart returned to play role after role that fit the mould of the gay couple, including in Howard&#x27;s &quot;The English Monsieur&quot; (December 1666), Richard Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Flora&#x27;s Vagaries&quot;, an adaptation of John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Chances&quot; by George Villiers, and their greatest success, &quot;Secret Love, or The Maiden Queen&quot;.

This play, a tragicomedy by the theatre&#x27;s house dramatist, John Dryden, was performed in March 1667. It was a great success: King Charles &quot;graced it with the Title of His Play&quot; and Pepys&#x27;s praise was effusive:

to the King&#x27;s house to see &#x27;The Maiden Queen&#x27;, a new play of Dryden&#x27;s, mightily commended for the regularity of it, and the strain and wit; and the truth is, there is a comical part done by Nell, which is Florimell, that I never can hope ever to see the like done again, by man or woman. The King and the Duke of York were at the play. But so great performance of a comical part was never, I believe, in the world before as Nell do this, both as a mad girl, then most and best of all when she comes in like a young gallant; and hath the notions and carriage of a spark the most that ever I saw any man have. It makes me, I confess, admire her.

After seeing the play for the third time, Pepys writes, &quot;It is impossible to have Florimel’s part, which is the most comical that ever was made for woman, ever done better than it is by Nelly.&quot; Killigrew must have agreed with Pepys; once Gwyn left the acting profession, it was at least ten years before his company revived &quot;The Maiden Queen&quot; and even the less favoured &quot;The Indian Emperour&quot; because &quot;the management evidently felt that it would be useless to present these plays without her&quot;.

&quot;The Maiden Queen&quot; featured breeches roles, where an actress appeared in men&#x27;s clothes under one pretence or another, and as Bax supposes &quot;was one of the first occasions upon which a woman appeared in the disguise of a man&quot;; if nothing else this could draw an audience eager to see women show off their figures in the more form-fitting male attire. The attraction had another dynamic: the theatres sometimes had a hard time holding onto their actresses, as they were swept up to become kept mistresses of the aristocracy. In 1667, Gwyn made such a match with Charles Sackville, titled Lord Buckhurst at that time. She supposedly caught his eye during an April performance of &quot;All Mistaken, or The Mad Couple&quot;, especially in one scene in which, to escape a hugely fat suitor able to move only by rolling, she rolls across the stage herself, her feet toward the audience and her petticoats flying about. A satire of the time describes this and also Hart&#x27;s position now, in the face of competition from the upper echelons of society:

Yet Hart more manners had, then not to tenderWhen noble Buckhurst beg&#x27;d him to surrender.He saw her roll the stage from side to sideAnd, through her drawers the powerful charm descry&#x27;d.
Beauclerk describes Buckhurst: &quot;Cultured, witty, satirical, dissolute, and utterly charming&quot;. He was one of a handful of court wits, the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; as named by Andrew Marvell. Sometime after the end of April and her last recorded role that season (in Robert Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Surprisal&quot;), Gwyn and Buckhurst left London for a country holiday in Epsom, accompanied by Charles Sedley, another wit in the merry gang. Pepys reports the news on 13 July: &quot;[Mr. Pierce tells us] Lord Buckhurst hath got Nell away from the King&#x27;s house, lies with her, and gives her £100 a year, so she hath sent her parts to the house, and will act no more.&quot; Gwyn was acting once more in late August, and her brief affair with Buckhurst had ended. Pepys reports that by 22 August 1667, Gwyn had returned to the King&#x27;s Playhouse in &quot;The Indian Emperour&quot;. On 26 August, Pepys learns from Moll Davis that &#x27;Nell is already left by my Lord Buckhurst, and that he makes sport of her, and swears she hath had all she could get of him; and Hart, her great admirer, now hates her; and that she is very poor, and hath lost my Lady Castlemayne, who was her great friend also but she is come to the House, but is neglected by them all&#x27;.

== Relationship with King Charles II ==

Late in 1667, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, took on the role of unofficial manager for Gwyn&#x27;s love affairs. He aimed to provide King Charles II with someone who would supplant Barbara Palmer, his principal mistress and Buckingham&#x27;s cousin, moving Buckingham closer to the King&#x27;s ear. The plan failed; reportedly, Gwyn asked £500 a year to be kept and this was rejected as too expensive. Buckingham had an alternative plan, which was to set the King up with Moll Davis, an actress with the rival Duke&#x27;s Company. Davis was Gwyn&#x27;s first rival for the King. Several anonymous satires from the time relate a tale of Gwyn, with the help of her friend Aphra Behn, slipping a powerful laxative into Davis&#x27;s tea-time cakes before an evening when she was expected in the King&#x27;s bed.

The love affair between the King and Gwyn allegedly began in April 1668. Gwyn was attending a performance of George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;She Wou&#x27;d if She Cou&#x27;d&quot; at the theatre in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. In the next box was the King, who from accounts was more interested in flirting with Gwyn than watching the play. Charles invited Gwyn and her escort, Mr. Villiers, a cousin of Buckingham&#x27;s, to supper along with his brother the Duke of York. The anecdote turns charming if perhaps apocryphal at this point: the King, after supper, discovered that he had no money on him; nor did his brother, and Gwyn had to foot the bill. &quot;Od&#x27;s fish!&quot; she exclaimed, in an imitation of the King&#x27;s manner of speaking, &quot;but this is the poorest company I ever was in!&quot;
Having previously been the mistress of Charles Hart and Charles Sackville, Gwyn jokingly called the King &quot;her Charles the Third&quot;. By mid-1668, Gwyn&#x27;s affair with the King was well-known, though there was little reason to believe it would last long. She continued to act at the King&#x27;s House, her new notoriety drawing larger crowds and encouraging the playwrights to craft more roles specifically for her. June 1668 found her in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;An Evening&#x27;s Love&quot;, or &quot;The Mock Astrologer&quot;, and in July she played in Lacy&#x27;s &quot;The Old Troop&quot;, a farce about a company of Cavalier soldiers during the English Civil War, based on Lacy&#x27;s own experiences. Possibly, Gwyn&#x27;s father had served in the same company, and Gwyn&#x27;s part—the company whore—was based on her own mother. As her commitment to the King increased, though, her acting career slowed, and she had no recorded parts between January and June 1669, when she played Valeria in Dryden&#x27;s successful tragedy &quot;Tyrannick Love&quot;.

Charles II had a considerable number of mistresses during his life, both short affairs and committed arrangements. He also had a wife, Portuguese Queen consort Catherine of Braganza, whose pregnancies all ended in miscarriages, and who had little or no say over Charles&#x27;s choice to have mistresses. This had come to a head shortly after their marriage in 1662, in a confrontation between Catherine and Barbara Palmer, which became known as the &quot;Bedchamber crisis&quot;. Ostracised at Court and with most of her retinue sent back to Portugal, Catherine had little choice but to acquiesce to Charles&#x27;s mistresses being granted semi-official standing.

During Gwyn&#x27;s first years with Charles, there was little competition in the way of other mistresses: Barbara Palmer was on her way out, while others, such as Moll Davis, kept quietly away from the spotlight of public appearances or Whitehall. Gwyn gave birth to her first son fathered by Charles II, Charles Beauclerk, on 8 May 1670. He was the King&#x27;s seventh son by five separate mistresses.

Several months later, Louise de Kérouaille came to England from France, ostensibly to serve as a maid of honour to Queen Catherine, but also to become another mistress to King Charles, probably by design on both the French and English sides. She and Gwyn were rivals for many years to come. They were opposites in personality and mannerism; Louise a proud woman of noble birth used to the sophistication of Versailles, Gwyn a spirited and pranking ex-orange-wench. Gwyn nicknamed Louise &quot;Squintabella&quot; for her looks and the &quot;Weeping Willow&quot; for her tendency to sob. In one instance, recorded in a letter from George Legge to Lord Preston, Gwyn characteristically jabbed at the Duchess&#x27;s &quot;great lineage,&quot; dressing in black at Court, the same mourning attire as Louise when a prince of France died. Someone there asked, &quot;What the deuce was the Cham of Tartary to you?&quot; to which Gwyn responded, &quot;Oh, exactly the same relation that the French Prince was to Mademoiselle de Kérouaille.&quot; The Duchess of Portsmouth&#x27;s only recorded riposte was, &quot;anybody may know she has been an orange-wench by her swearing&quot;. Their relationship was not strictly adversarial; they were known to get together for tea and cards, for example. Basset was the popular game at the time, and Gwyn was a frequent—and high-stakes—gambler.

Gwyn returned to the stage again in late 1670, something Beauclerk calls an &quot;extraordinary thing to do&quot; for a mistress with a royal child. Her return was in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;The Conquest of Granada&quot;, a two-part epic produced in December 1670 and January 1671. This may have been her last play; 1671 was almost certainly her last season. Gwyn&#x27;s theatrical career spanned seven years and ended at the age of 21 (if we take 1650 to be her birth year).

In the cast list of Aphra Behn&#x27;s &quot;The Rover&quot;, produced at Dorset Garden in March 1677, the part of Angelica Bianca, &quot;a famous Curtezan&quot; is played by a Mrs. Gwin. This has sparked some confusion. The spelling of &#x27;Gwin&#x27; does not refer to Nell Gwyn, but to Mrs. Anne Quin. Nell Gwyn had left the stage by this point.

In February 1671, Gwyn moved into a brick townhouse at 79 Pall Mall. The property was owned by the crown and its current resident was instructed to transfer the lease to Gwyn. It would be her main residence for the rest of her life. Gwyn seemed unsatisfied with being a lessee only—in 1673, a letter written by that of Joseph Williamson stated that &quot;Madam Gwinn complains she has no house yet.&quot; Gwyn is said to have complained that &quot;she had always conveyed free under the Crown, and always would; and would not accept [the house] till it was conveyed free to her by an Act of Parliament.&quot; In 1676, Gwyn was granted the freehold of the property, which remained in her family until 1693; as of 1960 the property was still the only one on the south side of Pall Mall not owned by the Crown.

Gwyn gave birth to her second child by the King, christened James Beauclerk, on 25 December 1671, or Christmas Day.

There are two stories about how the eldest of her two children by Charles was given the Earldom of Burford, both of which are unverifiable. The first, and most popular, is that when Charles was six years old, on the arrival of the King, Gwyn said, &quot;Come here, you little bastard, and say hello to your father.&quot; When the King protested against her calling Charles that, she replied, &quot;Your Majesty has given me no other name by which to call him.&quot; In response, Charles created him Earl of Burford. Another is that Gwyn grabbed young Charles and hung him out of a window of Lauderdale House in Highgate, where she briefly resided, and threatened to drop him unless he was granted a peerage. The King cried out &quot;God save the Earl of Burford!&quot; and subsequently officially created the peerage, saving his son&#x27;s life. On 21 December 1676, a warrant was passed for &quot;a grant to Charles Beauclerc, the King&#x27;s natural son, and to the heirs male of his body, of the dignities of Baron of Heddington, co. Oxford, and Earl of Burford in the same county, with remainder to his brother, James Beauclerc, and the heirs male of his body.&quot; A few weeks later, James was given &quot;the title of Lord Beauclerc, with the place and precedence of the eldest son of an earl.&quot;

Shortly afterwards, the King granted Gwyn and their son a house, which was renamed Burford House, on the edge of the Home Park in Windsor. She lived there when the King was in residence at Windsor Castle. In addition to the properties mentioned above, Gwyn had a summer residence on the site of what is now 61–63 King&#x27;s Cross Road, London, which enjoyed later popularity as the Bagnigge Wells Spa. According to the London Encyclopedia (Macmillan, 1983) she &quot;entertained Charles II here with little concerts and breakfasts&quot;. An inscribed stone of 1680, saved and reinserted in the front wall of the present building, shows a carved mask which is probably a reference to her stage career.

Just after the death of Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans on 5 January 1684, King Charles granted his son Charles the title of Duke of St Albans, gave him an allowance of £1,000 a year, and also granted him the offices of Chief Ranger of Enfield Chase and Master of the Hawks in reversion; i.e., after the death of the current incumbents.

King Charles died on 6 February 1685. James II, obeying his brother&#x27;s deathbed wish, &quot;Let not poor Nelly starve,&quot; eventually paid most of Gwyn&#x27;s debts and gave her an annual pension of £1,500. He also paid off the mortgage on Gwyn&#x27;s Nottinghamshire lodge at Bestwood, which remained in the Beauclerk family until 1940. At the same time, James applied pressure on Gwyn and her son Charles to convert to Roman Catholicism, something she resisted.

== Death ==
In March 1687, Gwyn suffered a stroke that left her paralysed on one side. In May, a second stroke left her confined to the bed in her Pall Mall house; she made out her will on 9 July and a codicil on 18 October with her executors, Laurence Hyde (the Earl of Rochester), Thomas Earl of Pembroke, Sir Robert Sawyer the Attorney General, and Henry Sidney each receiving £100. Gwyn died from apoplexy &quot;almost certainly due to the acquired variety of syphilis&quot; on 14 November 1687, at ten in the evening, less than three years after the King&#x27;s death. She was 37 years old (if she was born in 1650). Her balance at Child&#x27;s Bank was reported to be well over four figures, and she possessed almost 15,000 ounces of plate. The Oxford Dictionary of Actors therefore suggests that &#x27;perhaps most of her wealth was in trust or not in liquid assets&#x27; which might explain why the rich woman was so poor. A letter from Wigmore to Etherege, the day after Gwyn&#x27;s burial, reports that Gwyn left about £1,000,000, &quot;a great many say more, few less&quot;. The majority of her estate went to her son. Gwyn&#x27;s will also conveys her charitable side with her leaving £100 to be distributed to the poor of the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields and Westminster and £50 to release debtors from prison every Christmas.

She was buried in the Church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, on 17 November 1687. In compliance with one of Gwyn&#x27;s final requests, Thomas Tenison, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, preached a sermon on 17 December from the text of Luke 15:7 &quot;Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.&quot; Her will and codicil were proved on 7 December 1687.

== Legacy ==
Though Gwyn was often caricatured as an empty-headed woman, John Dryden said that her greatest attribute was her native wit, and she certainly became a hostess who was able to keep the friendship of Dryden, the playwright Aphra Behn, William Ley, 4th Earl of Marlborough (a lover of hers), John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, and the King&#x27;s other mistresses. She is especially remembered for one particularly apt witticism, which was recounted in the memoirs of the Comte de Gramont, remembering the events of 1681:Nell Gwynn was one day passing through the streets of Oxford, in her coach, when the mob mistaking her for her rival, the Duchess of Portsmouth, commenced hooting and loading her with every opprobrious epithet. Putting her head out of the coach window, &quot;Good people&quot;, she said, smiling, &quot;you are mistaken; I am the &quot;Protestant&quot; whore.&quot; The &quot;Catholic&quot; whore was still the Frenchwoman Louise de Kérouaille, who had been created Duchess of Portsmouth in 1673.

The author of her 1752 biography relates a conversation (more than likely fabricated) between Gwyn and Charles II in which he, feeling at a loss, said, &quot;O, Nell! What shall I do to please the People of England? I am torn to pieces by their clamours.&quot;

&quot;If it please your Majesty,&quot; she replied, &quot;there is but one way left, which expedient I am afraid it will be difficult to persuade you to embrace. Dismiss your ladies, may it please your Majesty, and mind your business; the People of England will soon be &quot;pleased&quot;.&quot;

She is noted for another remark made to her coachman, who was fighting with another man who had called her a whore. She broke up the fight, saying, &quot;I &quot;am&quot; a whore. Find something else to fight about.&quot;

In 1937, a new ten-storey block of 437 flats in Sloane Avenue, Chelsea, was given the name Nell Gwynn House, and in a high alcove above the main entrance is a statue of Gwyn, with a Cavalier King Charles spaniel at her feet. Mostly unnoticed by passers-by, this is believed to be the only statue of a royal mistress in the capital city.

==Arms and lineage==
According to Paul A. Fox, &quot;[The coat of arms of Nell Gwyn] are clearly based on the arms attributed to Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, Prince of Powys: &quot;or, a lion rampant azure&quot;. Only one family of Gwyn or Wyn ever used these arms, and they were a little-known clan from Trelydan in Guilsfield, near Welshpool. This family were somewhat distant kinsmen of Nell&#x27;s own ancestors. One of its members was Captain John Gwyn, who taught King Charles II of England military exercises when he was Prince of Wales, and served throughout the English Civil War and afterwards in the Royal Regiment of Guards, later commanded by the king&#x27;s son, the Duke of Monmouth. He can be placed in some of the same campaigns as Captain Thomas Gwyn, and the two men had probably met. John [Gwyn] has left a famous account of his exploits during the war, which include his pedigree and arms. It is likely that he would have sought out Nell and claimed kinship with her, as a means of furthering his own military career. It is hard to imagine how otherwise Nell would have come to bear the arms that she did.&quot; It is unknown if Nell&#x27;s arms were officially granted by the College of Arms during the reign of King Charles II, or were self-assumed.

===Titles===
Nell Gwyn never received any official titles from King Charles II of England while serving as his mistress. Some accounts state that Charles II planned to ennoble Gwyn by making her the &quot;Countess of Greenwich&quot;, following the bestowing of the titles of Duchess of Cleveland, Countess of Castlemaine, Baroness Limerick, and Baroness Nonsuch upon his other mistress, Barbara Palmer; the title of Viscountess Shannon upon his first mistress, Elizabeth Killigrew; and the titles of Duchess of Portsmouth, Duchess of Aubigny, Countess of Fareham, and Baroness Petersfield to yet another mistress, Louise de Kérouaille. However, Charles II died on 6 February 1685 before he could formally ennoble Gwyn. 

While Fox speculated that Gwyn was descended in the male line from Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, Prince of Powys, William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis (1626 – 2 June 1696), one of Charles II&#x27;s courtiers, had already been elevated by Charles II to Earl of Powis in 1674. Herbert was further reaffirmed as Marquess of Powis in 1687 by King James II.

Charles&#x27; younger brother and successor, King James II, paid off Gwyn&#x27;s debts at the request of Charles II, and gave her an estate with reversion to her son, Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans. However, James II refrained from ennobling Gwyn, likely due to doubts over Gwyn converting to Roman Catholicism, and her loyalty to the Crown. James II was not far off the mark; the Duke of St. Albans travelled to the Dutch Republic to support King William III and Queen Mary II deposing James II in the Glorious Revolution in November 1688. The Duke of St. Albans would go on to become a court favorite of William and Mary, fighting on the Crown&#x27;s behalf on military campaigns in Flanders.

By the time William and Mary came to power, Nell Gwyn had already died on 14 November 1687, a full year prior. In 1705, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll was created Baron Chatham and Earl of Greenwich by Anne, Queen of Great Britain as a reward for his support for the Acts of Union 1707, and further elevated to the title Duke of Greenwich in 1719. Upon his death, his Scottish titles passed to his brother, and the English titles became extinct. The next title creation was in Peerage of Great Britain in 1767, when Lady Caroline Townshend was made Baroness Greenwich, in the County of Kent, with remainder to the male issue by her second husband, Charles Townshend. She was the daughter of John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, who had been created Earl of Greenwich in 1715 and Duke of Greenwich in 1719, titles which became extinct on his death in 1743. 

As Caroline&#x27;s two sons by her second husband predeceased her, the title became extinct upon her death in 1794, and reverted back to the Crown.

The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1947, when Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, on the morning of his wedding to Princess Elizabeth (who became Queen Elizabeth II), was made Baron Greenwich, of Greenwich in the County of London. He was made Duke of Edinburgh and Earl of Merioneth at the same time. Prince Philip died on 9 April 2021, and the title passed to his son Charles, Prince of Wales, until it merged with the Crown when he became King Charles III on 8 September 2022.

==Issue==

By King Charles II of England, Nell Gwyn had two sons:

* The Rt. Hon. Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St. Albans (8 May 1670 – 10 May 1726), created Earl of Burford and Baron Heddington, in the county of Oxfordshire, on 21 December 1676 at the age of 6, and Duke of St. Albans in 1684 at the age of 14.
* The Rt. Hon. Lord James Beauclerk, Baron Heddington (25 December 1671 – September 1680 or 1681), designated as brother&#x27;s heir to the Earl of Burford title in 1676 at the age of 5, should his elder brother fail to produce issue.

James Beauclerk was sent to school in Paris, France when he was 6, where he died there in either September 1680 or 1681. The circumstances of the child&#x27;s life in Paris and the cause of his death are both unknown, one of the few clues being that he died &quot;of a sore leg&quot;, which Beauclerk speculates could mean anything from an accident to poison. It is also unknown if James Beauclerk&#x27;s body was buried in France or England. The family&#x27;s history has been published in the authoritative book &quot;The House of Nell Gwyn&quot; (1974).

Charles Beauclerk, however, survived to adulthood. On 17 April 1694, at the age of 23, he married Lady Diana de Vere, daughter and sole heiress of Aubrey de Vere, 20th Earl of Oxford. She was a well-known beauty, who became a Lady of the Bedchamber to Caroline of Ansbach, Princess of Wales. By his wife, Charles Beauclerk gave Nell Gwyn twelve grandchildren:

===Grandchildren===
*Charles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St. Albans (6 April 169627 July 1751), eldest son and heir;
*Lady Diana Beauclerk (born c. 1697)
*Lord William Beauclerk (22 May 169823 February 1733 N.S.)
*Admiral Vere Beauclerk, 1st Baron Vere (14 July 169921 October 1781)
*Colonel Lord Henry Beauclerk (11 August 17015 January 1761)
*Lord Sidney Beauclerk (27 February 170323 November 1744)
*Lieutenant-General Lord George Beauclerk (26 December 170411 May 1768)
*Lord Seymour Beauclerk (born 24 June 1708c. 1709)
*Rev. Lord James Beauclerk (c. 170920 October 1787); was Bishop of Hereford (1746–1787)
*Lord Aubrey Beauclerk (c. 171022 March 1741), became a captain in the Royal Navy, and died at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias.
*Lady Mary Beauclerk (born c. 1712)
*Lady Anne Beauclerk (born c. 1714)

Charles Beauclerk died on 10 May 1726 at the age of 56, and was buried at Westminster Abbey on 20 May 1726, but has no monument or marker. His direct male-line descendant, and current holder of the Duchy of St. Albans, is Murray Beauclerk, 14th Duke of St. Albans (b. 19 January 1939), Governor-General of the Royal Stuart Society.

<doc id="574759" wikidata="Q5441228" url="?curid=574759" title="Feed forward (control)">
<text>A feed forward (sometimes written feedforward) is an element or pathway within a control system that passes a controlling signal from a source in its external environment to a load elsewhere in its external environment. This is often a command signal from an external operator.

In control engineering, a feedforward control system is a control system that uses sensors to detect disturbances affecting the system and then applies an additional input to minimize the effect of the disturbance. This requires a mathematical model of the system so that the effect of disturbances can be properly predicted.

A control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to the way the system reacts; it is in contrast with a system that also has feedback, which adjusts the input to take account of how it affects the system, and how the system itself may vary unpredictably.

In a feed-forward system, the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about, or measurements of, the process disturbances.

Some prerequisites are needed for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external command or controlling signal must be available, and the effect of the output of the system on the load should be known (that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time). Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called &#x27;ballistic&#x27;, because once a control signal has been sent, it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal. In contrast, &#x27;cruise control&#x27; adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.

These systems could relate to control theory, physiology, or computing.

== Overview ==
With feed-forward or feedforward control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system. In the house example, a feed-forward system may measure the fact that the door is opened and automatically turn on the heater before the house can get too cold. The difficulty with feed-forward control is that the effects of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted, and there must not be any unmeasured disturbances. For instance, if a window was opened that was not being measured, the feed-forward-controlled thermostat might let the house cool down.

The term has specific meaning within the field of CPU-based automatic control. The discipline of feedforward control as it relates to modern, CPU based automatic controls is widely discussed, but is seldom practiced due to the difficulty and expense of developing or providing for the mathematical model required to facilitate this type of control. Open-loop control and feedback control, often based on canned PID control algorithms, are much more widely used.

There are three types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. An example of a pure open loop control system is manual non-power-assisted steering of a motor car; the steering system does not have access to an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, power steering has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism. This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See Model predictive control.

If the driver is included in the system, then they do provide a feedback path by observing the direction of travel and compensating for errors by turning the steering wheel. In that case you have a feedback system, and the block labeled &quot;System&quot; in Figure(c) is a feed-forward system.

In other words, systems of different types can be nested, and the overall system regarded as a black-box.

Feedforward control is distinctly different from open loop control and teleoperator systems. Feedforward control requires a mathematical model of the plant (process and/or machine being controlled) and the plant&#x27;s relationship to any inputs or feedback the system might receive. Neither open loop control nor teleoperator systems require the sophistication of a mathematical model of the physical system or plant being controlled. Control based on operator input without integral processing and interpretation through a mathematical model of the system is a teleoperator system and is not considered feedforward control.

== History ==
Historically, the use of the term &quot;feedforward&quot; is found in works by Harold S. Black in US patent 1686792 (invented 17 March 1923) and D. M. MacKay as early as 1956. While MacKay&#x27;s work is in the field of biological control theory, he speaks only of feedforward systems. MacKay does not mention &quot;feedforward control&quot; or allude to the discipline of &quot;feedforward controls&quot;. MacKay and other early writers who use the term &quot;feedforward&quot; are generally writing about theories of how human or animal brains work. Black also has US patent 2102671 invented 2 August 1927 on the technique of feedback applied to electronic systems.

The discipline of &quot;feedforward controls&quot; was largely developed by professors and graduate students at Georgia Tech, MIT, Stanford and Carnegie Mellon. Feedforward is not typically hyphenated in scholarly publications. Meckl and Seering of MIT and Book and Dickerson of Georgia Tech began the development of the concepts of Feedforward Control in the mid-1970s. The discipline of Feedforward Controls was well defined in many scholarly papers, articles and books by the late 1980s.

== Benefits ==
The benefits of feedforward control are significant and can often justify the extra cost, time and effort required to implement the technology. Control accuracy can often be improved by as much as an order of magnitude if the mathematical model is of sufficient quality and implementation of the feedforward control law is well thought out. Energy consumption by the feedforward control system and its driver is typically substantially lower than with other controls. Stability is enhanced such that the controlled device can be built of lower cost, lighter weight, springier materials while still being highly accurate and able to operate at high speeds. Other benefits of feedforward control include reduced wear and tear on equipment, lower maintenance costs, higher reliability and a substantial reduction in hysteresis. Feedforward control is often combined with feedback control to optimize performance.

== Model ==
The mathematical model of the plant (machine, process or organism) used by the feedforward control system may be created and input by a control engineer or it may be learned by the control system. Control systems capable of learning and/or adapting their mathematical model have become more practical as microprocessor speeds have increased. The discipline of modern feedforward control was itself made possible by the invention of microprocessors.

Feedforward control requires integration of the mathematical model into the control algorithm such that it is used to determine the control actions based on what is known about the state of the system being controlled. In the case of control for a lightweight, flexible robotic arm, this could be as simple as compensating between when the robot arm is carrying a payload and when it is not. The target joint angles are adjusted to place the payload in the desired position based on knowing the deflections in the arm from the mathematical model&#x27;s interpretation of the disturbance caused by the payload. Systems that plan actions and then pass the plan to a different system for execution do not satisfy the above definition of feedforward control. Unless the system includes a means to detect a disturbance or receive an input and process that input through the mathematical model to determine the required modification to the control action, it is not true feedforward control.

===Open system===
In systems theory, an open system is a feed forward system that does not have any feedback loop to control its output. In contrast, a closed system uses on a feedback loop to control the operation of the system. In an open system, the output of the system is not fed back into the input to the system for control or operation.

== Applications ==

===Physiological feed-forward system===

In physiology, feed-forward control is exemplified by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion by the central autonomic network. Feed-forward control can be likened to learned anticipatory responses to known cues (predictive coding). Feedback regulation of the heartbeat provides further adaptiveness to the running eventualities of physical exertion. Feedforward systems are also found in biological control of other variables by many regions of animals brains.

Even in the case of biological feedforward systems, such as in the human brain, knowledge or a mental model of the plant (body) can be considered to be mathematical as the model is characterized by limits, rhythms, mechanics and patterns.

A pure feed-forward system is different from a homeostatic control system, which has the function of keeping the body&#x27;s internal environment &#x27;steady&#x27; or in a &#x27;prolonged steady state of readiness.&#x27; A homeostatic control system relies mainly on feedback (especially negative), in addition to the feedforward elements of the system.

===Gene regulation and feed-forward===
Feed-forward loops (FFLs), a three-node graph of the form A affects B and C and B affects C, are frequently observed in transcription networks in several organisms including &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, suggesting that they perform functions that are important for the functioning of these organisms. In &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot; transcription networks have been extensively studied, FFLs occur approximately three times more frequently than expected based on random (Erdös-Rényi) networks.

Edges in transcription networks are directed and signed, as they represent activation (+) or repression (-). The sign of a path in a transcription network can be obtained by multiplying the signs of the edges in the path, so a path with an odd number of negative signs is negative. There are eight possible three-node FFLs as each of the three arrows can be either repression or activation, which can be classified into coherent or incoherent FFLs. Coherent FFLs have the same sign for both the paths from A to C, and incoherent FFLs have different signs for the two paths.

The temporal dynamics of FFLs show that coherent FFLs can be sign-sensitive delays that filter input into the circuit. We consider the differential equations for a Type-I coherent FFL, where all the arrows are positive:

formula_1

formula_2

Where formula_3 and formula_4 are increasing functions in formula_5 and formula_6 representing production, and formula_7 and formula_8 are rate constants representing degradation or dilution of formula_6 and formula_10 respectively. formula_11 can represent an AND gate where formula_12 if either formula_13 or formula_14, for instance if formula_15 where formula_16 and formula_17 are step functions. In this case the FFL creates a time-delay between a sustained on-signal, i.e. increase in formula_5 and the output increase in formula_10. This is because production of formula_5 must first induce production of formula_6, which is then needed to induce production of formula_10. However, there is no time-delay in for an off-signal because a reduction of formula_5 immediately results in a decrease in the production term formula_11. This system therefore filters out fluctuations in the on-signal and detects persistent signals. This is particularly relevant in settings with stochastically fluctuating signals. In bacteria these circuits create time delays ranging from a few minutes to a few hours.

Similarly, an inclusive-OR gate in which formula_10 is activated by either formula_5 or formula_6 is a sign-sensitive delay with no delay after the ON step but with a delay after the OFF step. This is because an ON pulse immediately activates B and C, but an OFF step does not immediately result in deactivation of C because B can still be active. This can protect the system from fluctuations that result in the transient loss of the ON signal and can also provide a form of memory. Kalir, Mangan, and Alon, 2005 show that the regulatory system for flagella in &quot;E. coli&quot; is regulated with a Type 1 coherent feedforward loop.

For instance, the regulation of the shift from one carbon source to another in diauxic growth in &quot;E. coli&quot; can be controlled via a type-1 coherent FFL. In diauxic growth cells growth using two carbon sources by first rapidly consuming the preferred carbon source, and then slowing growth in a lag phase before consuming the second less preferred carbon source. In E. coli, glucose is preferred over both arabinose and lactose. The absence of glucose is represented via a small molecule cAMP. Diauxic growth in glucose and lactose is regulated by a simple regulatory system involving cAMP and the lac operon. However, growth in arabinose is regulated by a feedforward loop with an AND gate which confers an approximately 20 minute time delay between the ON-step in which cAMP concentration increases when glucose is consumed and when arabinose transporters are expressed. There is no time delay with the OFF signal which occurs when glucose is present. This prevents the cell from shifting to growth on arabinose based on short term fluctuations in glucose availability.

Additionally, feedforward loops can facilitate cellular memory. Doncic and Skotheim (2003) show this effect in the regulation in the mating of yeast, where extracellular mating pheromone induces mating behavior, including preventing cells from entering the cell cycle. The mating pheromone activates the MAPK pathway, which then activates the cell-cycle inhibitor Far1 and the transcription factor Ste12, which in turn increases the synthesis of inactive Far1. In this system, the concentration of active Far1 depends on the time integral of a function of the external mating pheromone concentration. This dependence on past levels of mating pheromone is a form of cellular memory. This system simultaneously allows for the stability and reversibility.

Incoherent feedforward loops, in which the two paths from the input to the output node have different signs result in short pulses in response to an ON signal. In this system, input A simultaneous directly increases and indirectly decreases synthesis of output node C. If the indirect path to C (via B) is slower than the direct path a pulse of output is produced in the time period before levels of B are high enough to inhibit synthesis of C. Response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in dividing mammalian cells is an example of a Type-1 incoherent FFL.

The frequent observation of feed-forward loops in various biological contexts across multiple scales suggests that they have structural properties that are highly adaptive in many contexts. Several theoretical and experimental studies including those discussed here show that FFLs create a mechanism for biological systems to process and store information, which is important for predictive behavior and survival in complex dynamically changing environments.

===Feed-forward systems in computing===
In computing, feed-forward normally refers to a perceptron network in which the outputs from all neurons go to following but not preceding layers, so there are no feedback loops. The connections are set up during a training phase, which in effect is when the system is a feedback system.

===Long distance telephony===
In the early 1970s, intercity coaxial transmission systems, including L-carrier, used feed-forward amplifiers to diminish linear distortion. This more complex method allowed wider bandwidth than earlier feedback systems. Optical fiber, however, made such systems obsolete before many were built.

===Automation and machine control===
Feedforward control is a discipline within the field of automatic controls used in automation.

===Parallel feed-forward compensation with derivative (PFCD)===
The method is rather a new technique that changes the phase of an open-loop transfer function of a non-minimum phase system into minimum phase.

<text>Goðafoss () is a waterfall in northern Iceland. It is located along the country&#x27;s main ring road at the junction with the Sprengisandur highland road, about 45 minutes from Akureyri. The water of the river Skjálfandafljót falls from a height of 12 metres over a width of 30 metres. A 1.8-mile hiking trail loops around the waterfall area.

== Name ==
The origin of the waterfall&#x27;s name is not completely clear. In modern Icelandic, the name can be read either as &quot;waterfall of the &quot;goð&quot; (gods)&quot; or &quot;waterfall of the &quot;goði&quot; (chieftain).&quot; Linguist and placename expert Svavar Sigmundsson suggests that the name derives from two crags at the falls which resemble pagan idols. In 1879–1882, a myth was published in Denmark according to which the waterfall was named when the lawspeaker Þorgeir Ljósvetningagoði made Christianity the official religion of Iceland in the year 999 or 1000. Upon returning home from the Alþingi, Þorgeir supposedly threw his statues of the Norse gods into the waterfall. However, although the story of Þorgeir&#x27;s role in the adoption of Christianity in Iceland is preserved in Ari Þorgilsson&#x27;s &quot;Íslendingabók,&quot; no mention is made of Þorgeir throwing his idols into Goðafoss. The legend appears to be a nineteenth-century fabrication. Nevertheless, a window in Akureyrarkirkja, the main church at Akureyri, illustrates this story.

== History ==
MS Goðafoss, an Icelandic ship named after the waterfall, used to transport both freight and passengers. It was sunk by a German U-Boat in World War II, resulting in great loss of life.

In 2020, the waterfall was granted protected status.

<doc id="574768" wikidata="Q1787875" url="?curid=574768" title="Roxanne (film)">
<text>Roxanne is a 1987 American romantic comedy film directed by Fred Schepisi and starring Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah. It is a modern retelling of Edmond Rostand&#x27;s 1897 verse play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;.

== Plot ==
Charlie &quot;C.D.&quot; Bales is the intelligent, witty, charismatic and athletic fire chief of the small town of Nelson where he is well liked by the town residents. Nevertheless, he is sensitive about his abnormally large nose, which most of the town knows not to mention in front of him. When the beautiful Roxanne Kowalski, an astronomy PhD student, arrives to stay in town over the Summer while searching for a passing comet, he, and many others, are drawn to her. However, he believes she would never be attracted to him because of his nose. Though Roxanne adores him as a friend, she is physically attracted to Chris McConnell, a handsome but dimwitted fireman newly recruited into C.D.&#x27;s bumbling and slow-learning team.

After seeing Chris buy a book by Sartre for a friend, she assumes he is deeply intelligent and asks C.D. to approach him on her behalf. When Chris hears of her interest, he feels ill as women intimidate him. He tries to write her a letter but takes all day with little result. He then convinces C.D. to write it with prose that successfully woos Roxanne. When told Roxanne wants to meet up, a nerve-wracked Chris insists C.D. help him seem equally brilliant in person. He arrives at Roxanne&#x27;s wearing concealed earphones that relay C.D.&#x27;s words. When the equipment fails, Chris bungles it by objectifying Roxanne and she furiously ends their date. He begs C.D. for help and, as Chris is unable to relay what C.D. prompts, C.D. obscures himself behind a tree and confesses his true feelings of love for Roxanne while pretending to be Chris. His words touch Roxanne and she invites Chris inside her home to make love, much to C.D.&#x27;s chagrin.

Roxanne goes out of town for a week and leaves her hotel address with C.D. so Chris can write to her. Instead of telling Chris, C D. writes her three times a day, each letter more impactfully romantic than the last. Meanwhile, Chris and local bartender Sandy begin flirting. While writing a new letter, C.D.&#x27;s god sister and close friend Dixie encourages him to tell Roxanne he loves her. Upon learning that Roxanne has returned early, C.D. rushes to warn Chris that she may mention the letters, leaving behind his new letter which Dixie reads. Roxanne tries to get Chris to be the man in the letters, revealing his looks are only secondary for her. Feeling ill, and believing his looks are all he has, he runs out, leaving her confused. Chris leaves town with Sandy for Tahoe, writing Roxanne a breakup letter.

C.D. visits Roxanne who reveals she knows the truth: Dixie delivered C.D.&#x27;s final letter with a note revealing him as the author and Roxanne compared the handwriting with Chris&#x27;s poorly-written letter. Furious that C.D. misled and tricked her, she punches him in the nose and throws him out. Before he can say more, he is distracted by his extra-keen sense of smell detecting a fire. He alerts his team and leads them to a large fire which they successfully extinguish.

While resting on his roof, C.D. hears Roxanne reciting his words to him. She tells C.D. that it was his words that she fell in love with, which made her feel romantic, intelligent, and feminine, and it is C.D. she truly loves. C.D. stylishly descends from the roof, and they kiss before retiring inside his home. To C.D.&#x27;s delight she tells him she named the comet Charlie, but reveals it is named after her father.

== Production ==
Steve Martin had always been a fan of the José Ferrer version of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;:
I remember just thinking it was the greatest thing I ever saw. I think it&#x27;s because the character is so strong. He&#x27;s like a very smart version of what, coincidentally, is popular in movies today. He&#x27;s smarter than everybody else, quicker than everybody else, wittier than everybody else and tops everybody. That&#x27;s what the original Cyrano is like. And this just sort of takes that vicious edge off it.
In the early-1980s Martin had the idea of updating the play, only with the difference that Cyrano would get the girl in the end. He decided to write the screenplay himself, writing 25 drafts over three years. The film was greenlit at Columbia by then-production chief Guy McElwaine. He was replaced by David Puttnam who liked the script, continued the studio&#x27;s support and suggested the casting of Daryl Hannah. It was the first film released under Puttnam&#x27;s auspices at Columbia.

&quot;Roxanne&quot; was filmed in the summer of 1986 in the town of Nelson, British Columbia. Steve Martin chose to use the local fire hall on Ward Street as a primary set. Although the movie has references to the town&#x27;s name being &quot;Nelson&quot;, it is portrayed as being in the USA. The mailboxes which figure in the plot are USPS blue, not Canada Post red. In the bar scenes, neon signs for Miller beer show the advertising slogan of the time: &quot;Made the American Way&quot;, which was not used in Canada. There is also a scene which shows the fire truck to have a Washington license plate, which complements an earlier scene in which Martin&#x27;s character makes a reference to Seattle. Martin&#x27;s nose makeup took 90 minutes to apply every day and two minutes to take off. &quot;God how I hated that thing&quot;, he said.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Roxanne&quot; received an 88% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews, with the consensus being: &quot;Though its sweetness borders on sappiness, &quot;Roxanne&quot; is an unabashedly romantic comedy that remains one of Steve Martin&#x27;s funniest&quot;. Metacritic gave film a score of 73 based on 19 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Roger Ebert hailed the film as a &quot;gentle, whimsical comedy&quot;, giving it a 3 and half stars of four, also stating: &quot;What makes &quot;Roxanne&quot; so wonderful is not this fairly straightforward comedy, however, but the way the movie creates a certain ineffable spirit&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
It has also won and has been nominated for a number of awards, including:

* Golden Globe Award: Nominated: Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture – Comedy/Musical: Steve Martin
* LAFCA Award: Won (Tied): Best Actor: Steve Martin (Tied with Jack Nicholson for &quot;Ironweed&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Witches of Eastwick&quot; (1987).)
* NSFC Award: Won: Best Actor: Steve Martin
* WGA Award (Screen): Won: Best Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium: Steve Martin

== References to the play ==
* The historical Cyrano de Bergerac wrote of a journey to the Moon and to the Sun, and &quot;Roxanne&quot; alludes to this in a scene where Bales jokes about UFOs and aliens. Additionally, that scene mirrors one in the play where Cyrano pretends to fall out of a tree to distract another wooer of Roxanne.
* The names of all three main characters are based on their counterparts in the play. C.D. Bales has the same initials as Cyrano de Bergerac, Roxanne&#x27;s name is a slight alteration of Roxane, and Chris is a shortened form of Christian.
* The string of nose-based insults that C.D. reels off in the bar parallels one that Cyrano delivers to Valvert in Act I of the play, and even paraphrases a portion of it:

:Cyrano: &quot;Oh, how you must love the little birds so much that when they come and sing to you, you give them this to perch on.&quot;
:C.D.: &quot;You must love the little birdies to give them this to perch on.&quot;

* C.D.&#x27;s position in the firefighters is similar to Cyrano&#x27;s leadership of the Gascon Cadets.

<doc id="574775" wikidata="Q1200992" url="?curid=574775" title="Abstraction layer">
<text>In computing, an abstraction layer or abstraction level is a way of hiding the working details of a subsystem. Examples of software models that use layers of abstraction include the OSI model for network protocols, OpenGL, and other graphics libraries, which allow the separation of concerns to facilitate interoperability and platform independence.

In computer science, an abstraction layer is a generalization of a conceptual model or algorithm, away from any specific implementation. These generalizations arise from broad similarities that are best encapsulated by models that express similarities present in various specific implementations. The simplification provided by a good abstraction layer allows for easy reuse by distilling a useful concept or design pattern so that situations, where it may be accurately applied, can be quickly recognized. Just composing lower-level elements into a construct doesn&#x27;t count as an abstraction layer unless it shields users from its underlying complexity. 

A layer is considered to be on top of another if it depends on it. Every layer can exist without the layers above it, and requires the layers below it to function. Frequently abstraction layers can be composed into a hierarchy of abstraction levels. The OSI model comprises seven abstraction layers. Each layer of the model encapsulates and addresses a different part of the needs of digital communications, thereby reducing the complexity of the associated engineering solutions.

A famous aphorism of David Wheeler is, &quot;All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection.&quot; This is often deliberately misquoted with &quot;abstraction&quot; substituted for &quot;indirection.&quot; It is also sometimes misattributed to Butler Lampson. Kevlin Henney&#x27;s corollary to this is, &quot;...except for the problem of too many layers of indirection.&quot;

==Computer architecture==
In a computer architecture, a computer system is usually represented as consisting of several abstraction levels such as:
* software
* programmable logic
* hardware
Programmable logic is often considered part of the hardware, while the logical definitions are also sometimes seen as part of a device&#x27;s software or firmware. Firmware may include only low-level software, but can also include all software, including an operating system and applications. The software layers can be further divided into hardware abstraction layers, physical and logical device drivers, repositories such as filesystems, operating system kernels, middleware, applications, and others. A distinction can also be made from low-level programming languages like VHDL, machine language, assembly language to a compiled language, interpreter, and script language.

==Input and output==
In the Unix operating system, most types of input and output operations are considered to be streams of bytes read from a device or written to a device. This stream of bytes model is used for file I/O, socket I/O, and terminal I/O in order to provide device independence. In order to read and write to a device at the application level, the program calls a function to open the device, which may be a real device such as a terminal or a virtual device such as a network port or a file in a file system. The device&#x27;s physical characteristics are mediated by the operating system which in turn presents an abstract interface that allows the programmer to read and write bytes from/to the device. The operating system then performs the actual transformation needed to read and write the stream of bytes to the device.

==Graphics==
Most graphics libraries such as OpenGL provide an abstract graphical device model as an interface. The library is responsible for translating the commands provided by the programmer into the specific device commands needed to draw the graphical elements and objects. The specific device commands for a plotter are different from the device commands for a CRT monitor, but the graphics library hides the implementation and device-dependent details by providing an abstract interface which provides a set of primitives that are generally useful for drawing graphical objects.

<text>The Explosion is an American punk rock band from Boston, Massachusetts. On February 13, 2007, the band announced that they had left Virgin Records, and on April 30, 2007, that they were to split up. On September 4, 2007, the band played their final show in New York though they have subsequently played multiple reunion shows.

==History==
Matt Hock and Damian Genuardi met David Walsh through Rama Mayo, owner of indie label Big Wheel Recreation. They started the band in the fall of 1998, with Cave and Colby eventually joining later.

They pressed 250 copies of a demo before going on tour with Kid Dynamite. A roadie gave the demo to indie rock label Jade Tree Records, who signed the band and put out a self-titled EP containing all the demo tracks in 2000.

Their debut full-length album, &quot;Flash Flash Flash&quot; on Jade Tree, was released to glowing reviews. &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; named it as one of the best 20 albums of 2000, and later named the band one of the top-10 punk acts of 2001. The Explosion also came in second for &quot;best local punk act&quot; in &quot;the Boston Phoenix.&quot; They began touring the U.S. and Europe with the likes of Sick of it All, AFI (A Fire Inside), the Nerve Agents, Avail, Leatherface, US Bombs, Alkaline Trio, The Queers, Social Distortion, Tiger Army, The International Noise Conspiracy, Rocket From the Crypt and Joe Strummer and the Mescaleros. They were also featured on the 2001 and 2005 Warped Tours. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Points West&quot; was featured in the PC version of the game &quot;True Crime: Streets of L.A.&quot;

However, they soon faced a problem. Genuardi&#x27;s former straight edge hardcore band, In My Eyes, had been signed to Revelation Records. Revelation Records threatened to sue Genuardi if he was credited on any of The Explosion&#x27;s records, believing that The Explosion&#x27;s success with Jade Tree should belong to them. The Explosion settled the dispute by writing an EP for Revelation, sarcastically titled &quot;Steal This&quot;.

In 2003, they released an EP called &quot;Sick of Modern Art&quot; on their own label, Tarantulas Records.

Seven major labels soon became involved in a bidding war over The Explosion. They were eventually signed to Virgin Records, who distributed &quot;Sick of Modern Art&quot;. Their album &quot;Black Tape&quot; was recorded at Cider Mountain Recorders by C. Phillips and J. Hehn. It was released on Virgin in the United States on October 5, 2004, then on March 15 in the UK. Songs off this album were featured on several video games such as &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition&quot;, and &quot;NFL Street 2&quot;.

On October 21, 2004, they performed live on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien.

The Explosion finished recording their second Virgin Records effort in 2006, but it was left unreleased. In March 2008 it was announced that the record, titled &quot;Bury Me Standing&quot;, would be released on the new label Paper + Plastick. Once again, the album was not released. In December 2011 it was announced that Chunksaah Records, the label run by the band&#x27;s friends The Bouncing Souls, would release the album on February 14, 2012.

On December 2, 2011, it was announced that the band would be doing a one-off performance with The Bouncing Souls on December 28, 2011, in Asbury Park, New Jersey, as part of the Souls&#x27; fifth annual &quot;Home For The Holidays&quot; shows.

On April 1, 2014, an appearance at the annual This Is Hardcore Festival in Philadelphia was announced for the band.

The band performed their third reunion show at Asbury Park, New Jersey on July 29, 2016.

On May 8, 2019 Bad Religion announced The Explosion would be supporting them on their next tour.

<text>Callinectes sapidus (from the Ancient Greek ,&quot;beautiful&quot; + , &quot;swimmer&quot;, and Latin , &quot;savory&quot;), the blue crab, Atlantic blue crab, or, regionally, the Maryland blue crab, is a species of crab native to the waters of the western Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, and introduced internationally.

&quot;C. sapidus&quot; is of considerable culinary and economic importance in the United States, particularly in Louisiana, the Carolinas, the Chesapeake Bay, Delaware, and New Jersey. It is the Maryland state crustacean and the state&#x27;s largest commercial fishery. Due to overfishing and environmental pressures some of the fisheries have seen declining yields, especially in the Chesapeake Bay fishery. 

Unlike the other fisheries affected by climate change, blue crab is expected to do well; warming causes better breeding conditions, more survivable winters, and a greater range of habitable areas on the Atlantic coast. Whether this will have negative effects on the surrounding ecosystems from an increased crab population is still unclear.

==Description==

&quot;C. sapidus&quot; is a decapod crab of the swimming crab family Portunidae. The genus &quot;Callinectes&quot; is distinguished from other portunid crabs by the lack of an internal cartilaginous spine on the carpus (the middle segment of the claw), as well as by the T-shape of the male abdomen. Blue crabs may grow to a carapace width of . &quot;C. sapidus&quot; individuals exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males and females are easily distinguished by the shape of the abdomen (known as the &quot;apron&quot;) and by color differences in the chelipeds, or claws. The abdomen is long and slender in males, but wide and rounded in mature females. A popular mnemonic is that the male&#x27;s apron is shaped like the Washington Monument, while the mature female&#x27;s resembles the dome of the United States Capitol. Claw color differences are more subtle than apron shape. The immovable, fixed finger of the claws in males is blue with red tips, while females have orange coloration with purple tips. A female&#x27;s abdomen changes as it matures: an immature female has a triangular-shaped abdomen, whereas a mature female&#x27;s is rounded.

Other species of &quot;Callinectes&quot; may be easily confused with &quot;C. sapidus&quot; because of overlapping ranges and similar morphology. One species is the lesser blue crab (&quot;C. similis&quot;). It is found further offshore than the common blue crab, and has a smoother granulated carapace. Males of the lesser blue crab also have mottled white coloration on the swimming legs, and females have areas of violet coloration on the internal surfaces of the claws. &quot;C. sapidus&quot; can be distinguished from another related species found within its range, &quot;C. ornatus&quot;, by number of frontal teeth on the carapace. &quot;C. sapidus&quot; has four, while &quot;C. ornatus&quot; has six.

The crab&#x27;s blue hue stems from a number of pigments in the shell, including alpha-crustacyanin, which interacts with a red pigment, astaxanthin, to form a greenish-blue coloration. When the crab is cooked, the alpha-crustacyanin breaks down, leaving only the astaxanthin, which turns the crab to a bright orange-red color.

Organochlorides are found by Sheridan et al 1975 to be transferred to the &quot;C. sapidus&quot; hepatopancreas. They find that among organochlorides, DDT specifically is converted both to DDE and DDD in this crab.

==Distribution==
&quot;C. sapidus&quot; is native to the western edge of the Atlantic Ocean from Cape Cod to Argentina and around the entire coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It has recently been reported north of Cape Cod in the Gulf of Maine, potentially representing a range expansion due to climate change. It has been introduced (via ballast water) to Japanese and European waters, and has been observed in the Baltic, North, Mediterranean, and Black Seas. The first record from European waters was made in 1901 at Rochefort, France. In some parts of its introduced range, &quot;C. sapidus&quot; has become the subject of crab fishery, including in Greece, where the local population may be decreasing as a result of overfishing. In Italy, public awareness of the detrimental impact of this species on local molluscs is rapidly growing and, especially in the Po delta area and on the Adriatic Sea coast, eradication efforts are undergoing, both by local authorities and by local fishermen.

==Ecology==
Some of the natural predators of &quot;C. sapidus&quot; include eels, drum, striped bass, spot, trout, some sharks, humans, cownose rays, and whiptail stingrays. &quot;C. sapidus&quot; is an omnivore, eating both plants and animals. It typically consumes thin-shelled bivalves (such as clams, mussels, and oysters), crustaceans, annelids, small fish, plants (such as eelgrass), and nearly any other item it can find, including carrion, other &quot;C. sapidus&quot; individuals, and animal waste. In salt marshes, &quot;C. sapidus&quot; will eat marsh periwinkles, &quot;Littoraria irrorata&quot; during high tides. Although an aquatic predator, &quot;C. sapidus&quot; will remain in shallow pits in salt marshes at low tide and ambush intertidal prey such as fiddler crabs (e.g., &quot;Minuca pugnax&quot;) and purple marsh crabs (&quot;Sesarma reticulatum&quot;) &quot;C. sapidus&quot; may be able to control populations of the invasive green crab, &quot;Carcinus maenas&quot;; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and &quot;C. maenas&quot; is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where &quot;C. sapidus&quot; is most abundant.

&quot;C. sapidus&quot; is subject to a number of diseases and parasites. These include a number of viruses, bacteria, microsporidians, ciliates, and others. The nemertean worm &quot;Carcinonemertes carcinophila&quot; commonly parasitizes &quot;C. sapidus&quot;, especially females and older crabs, although it has little adverse effect on the crab. A trematode that parasitizes &quot;C. sapidus&quot; is itself targeted by the hyperparasite &quot;Urosporidium crescens&quot;. The most harmful parasites may be the microsporidian &quot;Ameson michaelis&quot;, the amoeba &quot;Paramoeba perniciosa&quot; and the dinoflagellate &quot;Hematodinium perezi&quot;, which causes &quot;bitter crab disease&quot;.

In 2021, scientists from the University of Maryland completed DNA sequencing on &quot;C. sapidus&#x27;s&quot; genome in Baltimore after six years of research to help better understand the species. This genetic map is expected to help scientists understand how the blue crabs will be affected by climate change and warmer water temperatures, along with which mutations cause disease, traits that influence meat production, and which females have the best reproductive ability.

==Lifecycle==

===Growth===
Eggs of &quot;C. sapidus&quot; hatch in high-salinity waters of inlets, coastal waters, and mouths of rivers, and are carried to the ocean by ebb tides. During seven planktonic (zoeal) stages, blue crab larvae float near the surface and feed on microorganisms they encounter. After the eighth zoeal stage, larvae molt into megalopae. This larval form has small claws called chelipeds for grasping prey items. Megalopae selectively migrate upward in the water column as tides travel landward toward estuaries. Eventually, blue crabs arrive in brackish water, where they spend the majority of their lives. Chemical cues in estuarine water prompt metamorphosis to the juvenile phase, after which blue crabs appear similar to the adult form.

A blue crab grows by shedding its exoskeleton, or molting, to expose a new, larger exoskeleton. After it hardens, the new shell fills with body tissue. Shell hardening occurs most quickly in low-salinity water where high osmotic pressure allows the shell to become rigid soon after molting. Molting reflects only incremental growth, making age estimation difficult. For blue crabs, the number of molts in a lifetime is fixed at about 25. Females typically exhibit 18 molts after the larval stages, while postlarval males molt about 20 times. 
Male blue crabs tend to grow broader and have more accentuated lateral spines than females. Growth and molting are profoundly influenced by temperature and food availability. Higher temperatures and greater food resources decrease the period of time between molts, as well as the change in size during molts (molt increment). Salinity and disease also have subtle impacts on molting and growth rate. Molting occurs more rapidly in low-salinity environments. The high osmotic pressure gradient causes water to quickly diffuse into a soft, recently molted blue crab&#x27;s shell, allowing it to harden more quickly. The effects of diseases and parasites on growth and molting are less well understood, but in many cases have been observed to reduce growth between molts. For example, mature female blue crabs infected with the parasitic rhizocephalan barnacle &quot;Loxothylacus texanus&quot; appear extremely stunted in growth when compared to uninfected mature females. Blue crabs may reach maturity within one year of hatching in the Gulf of Mexico, while Chesapeake Bay crabs may take up to 18 months to mature. As a result of different growth rates, commercial and recreational crabbing occur year-round in the Gulf of Mexico, while crabbing seasons are closed for colder parts of the year in northern states.

===Reproduction===

Mating and spawning are distinct events in blue crab reproduction. Males may mate several times and undergo no major changes in morphology during the process. Female blue crabs mate only once in their lifetimes during their pubertal, or terminal, molt. During this transition, the abdomen changes from a triangular to a semicircular shape. Mating in blue crab is a complex process that requires precise timing of mating at the time of the female&#x27;s terminal molt. It generally occurs during the warmest months of the year. Prepubertal females migrate to the upper reaches of estuaries, where males typically reside as adults. To ensure that a male can mate, he actively seeks a receptive female and guards her for up to seven days until she molts, when insemination occurs. Crabs compete with other individuals before, during, and after insemination, so mate guarding is very important for reproductive success. After mating, a male must continue to guard the female until her shell has hardened. Inseminated females retain spermatophores for up to one year, which they use for multiple spawnings in high salinity water. During spawning, a female extrudes fertilized eggs onto her swimmerets and carries them in a large egg mass, or sponge, while they develop. Females migrate to the mouth of the estuary to release the larvae, the timing of which is believed to be influenced by light, tide, and lunar cycles. Blue crabs have high fecundity; females may produce up to 2 million eggs per brood.

Migration and reproduction patterns differ between crab populations along the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. A distinct and large-scale migration occurs in Chesapeake Bay, where &quot;C. sapidus&quot; undergoes a seasonal migration of up to several hundred miles. In the middle and upper parts of the bay, mating peaks in mid- to late summer, while in the lower bay, peaks in mating activity occur during spring and late summer through early fall. Changes in salinity and temperature may impact time of mating because both factors are important during the molting process. After mating, the female crab travels to the southern portion of the Chesapeake, using ebb tides to migrate from areas of low salinity to areas of high salinity, fertilizing her eggs with sperm stored during her single mating months or almost a year before.

Spawning events in the Gulf of Mexico are less pronounced than in estuaries along the East Coast, like the Chesapeake. In northern waters of the Gulf of Mexico, spawning occurs in the spring, summer, and fall, and females generally spawn twice. During spawning, females migrate to high -salinity waters to develop a sponge, and return inland after hatching their larvae. They develop their second sponge inland, and again migrate to the high-salinity waters to hatch the second sponge. After this, they typically do not re-enter the estuary. Blue crabs along the southernmost coast of Texas may spawn year-round.

==Commercial importance==

===Range of fisheries===

Commercial fisheries for &quot;C. sapidus&quot; exist along much of the Atlantic coast of the United States, and in the Gulf of Mexico. Although the fishery has been historically centered on the Chesapeake Bay, contributions from other localities are increasing in importance. In the past two decades, most commercial crabs have been landed in four states: Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Louisiana. Weight and value of harvests since 2000 are listed below.

===History of the crab fishery===
As early as the 1600s, the blue crab was an important food item for Native Americans and English settlers in the Chesapeake Bay area. Soft and hard blue crabs were not as valuable as fish, but gained regional popularity by the 1700s. Throughout their range, crabs were also an effective bait type for hook-and-line fisheries. Rapid perishing limited the distribution and hindered the growth of the fishery. Advances in refrigeration techniques in the late 1800s and early 1900s increased demand for blue crab nationwide.

====Atlantic Coast====
The early blue crab fishery along the Atlantic Coast was casual and productive because blue crabs were extremely abundant. In the lower Chesapeake Bay, crabs were even considered a nuisance species because they frequently clogged the nets of seine fishermen. Early on, the blue crab fishery of the Atlantic states was well documented. Atlantic states were the first to regulate the fishery, particularly the Chesapeake states. For example, after observing a slight decline in harvest, the fishing commissions of Virginia and Maryland put size limits into place by 1912 and 1917, respectively. Catch-per-unit-effort at the time was determined by packing houses, or crab processing plants.

====Gulf of Mexico====
The early history of the recreational blue crab fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial crabbing was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing gear types to trap crabs at night. Blue crab spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered the growth of the fishery for several decades. The first commercial processing plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although commercial processing of hard blue crabs was not widespread until World War II.

===Louisiana fishery===
Louisiana now has the world&#x27;s largest blue-crab fishery. Commercial harvests in the state account for over half of all landings in the Gulf of Mexico. The industry was not commercialized for interstate commerce until the 1990s, when supply markedly decreased in Maryland due to problems (see above) in Chesapeake Bay. Since then, Louisiana has steadily increased its harvest. In 2002, Louisiana harvested 22% of the nation&#x27;s blue crab. That number rose to 26% by 2009 and 28% by 2012. The vast majority of Louisiana crabs are shipped to Maryland, where they are sold as &quot;Chesapeake&quot; or &quot;Maryland&quot; crab. Louisiana&#x27;s harvest remained high in 2013, with 17,597 metric tons of blue crab valued at $51 million. In addition to commercial harvesting, recreational crabbing is very popular along Louisiana&#x27;s coast.
===Chesapeake Bay fishery===
The Chesapeake Bay has had the largest blue crab harvest for more than a century. Maryland and Virginia are usually the top two Atlantic coast states in annual landings, followed by North Carolina. In 2013, crab landings were valued at $18.7 million from Maryland waters and $16.1 million from Virginia waters. Although crab populations are currently declining, blue crab fishing in Maryland and Virginia remains a livelihood for thousands of coastal residents. As of 2001, Maryland and Virginia collectively had 4,816 commercial crab license holders. Three separate licenses are required for each of the three major jurisdictional areas: Maryland, the Potomac River, and Virginia waters. While the Bay&#x27;s commercial sector lands the majority of hard crab landings and nearly all peeler or soft crab landings, the recreational fishery is also significant. In 2013, an estimated of blue crab were harvested recreationally.

====Recent decline====
Blue crab populations naturally fluctuate with annual changes in environmental conditions. They have been described as having a long-term dynamic equilibrium, which was first noted after irregular landings data in the Chesapeake in 1950. This tendency may have made it difficult for managers to predict the severe decline of the Chesapeake&#x27;s blue crab populations. Once considered an overwhelmingly abundant annoyance, the declining blue crab population is now the subject of anxiety among fishermen and managers. Over the decade between the mid-1990s to 2004, the population fell from 900 million to around 300 million, and harvest weight fell from . Revenue fell further, from $72 million to $61 million. Long-term estimates say that the overall Chesapeake population decreased around 70% in the last few decades. Even more alarming, the number of females capable of reproducing, known as spawning age females, has plummeted 84% in just a few decades. Survival and addition of juveniles to the harvestable crab population is also low. Many factors are to blame for low blue crab numbers, including high fishing pressure, environmental degradation, and disease prevalence. The 2018 reduction in H-2B visas available for seasonal workers is affecting Maryland&#x27;s 20 crab processors, which typically employ about 500 foreign workers, but the effect this will have on the crab fishery is not yet clear.

===Crabbing gear===
Many types of gear have been used to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially, people used very simple techniques and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other gear types. The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major gear type used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid, box-like traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.

====Bycatch====
Species other than blue crab are often caught incidentally in crab pots, including fish, turtles, conch, and other crab species. In Georgia, hermit crabs (&quot;Pagurus&quot; spp.), channeled whelk (&quot;Busycon canaliculatum&quot;), spider crabs (&quot;Libinia&quot; spp.), and stone crabs (&quot;Menippe mercenaria&quot;) were the most common species observed as bycatch in commercial crab pots. Of important concern is the diamondback terrapin, &quot;Malaclemys terrapin&quot;. The blue crab and diamondback terrapin have overlapping ranges along the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States. Because the funnels in a crab pot are flexible, small terrapins may easily enter and become entrapped. Traps are checked every 24 hours or less, frequently resulting in drowning and death of terrapins. Crab pot bycatch may reduce local terrapin populations to less than half. To reduce terrapin entrapment, bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) may be installed on each of the funnels in a crab pot. BRDs effectively reduce bycatch (and subsequently mortality) of small terrapins without affecting blue crab catch.

===Efforts to manage fisheries===
Because of its commercial and environmental value, &quot;C. sapidus&quot; is the subject of management plans over much of its range. In 2012, the &quot;C. sapidus&quot; population in Louisiana was recognized as a certified sustainable fishery by the Marine Stewardship Council. It was the first and remains the only certified sustainable blue crab fishery worldwide. For the state to maintain its certification, it must undergo annual monitoring and conduct a full re-evaluation five years after the certification date.

== Sports ==
The blue crab is the namesake of the Jersey Shore BlueClaws team in minor-league baseball playing in the South Atlantic League. They are located in Lakewood, New Jersey, and are a high-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.

Blue crabs are also the namesake of the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs, a professional baseball team located in Waldorf, Maryland.

<doc id="574807" wikidata="Q1509508" url="?curid=574807" title="M197 electric cannon">
<text>The M197 electric cannon is a 20 mm three-barreled electric Gatling-type rotary cannon used by the United States military.

==Development==
The M197 electric cannon was developed primarily for use by United States Army helicopter gunships. Development began in 1967 after experience in the Vietnam War revealed the inadequacy of the 7.62 mm Minigun for gunship use. The M197 is essentially a lightened version of the General Electric M61 Vulcan cannon, with three barrels instead of six. Its maximum rate of fire is one quarter that of the Vulcan, largely to limit its recoil for light aircraft and helicopter use. It shares the Vulcan&#x27;s M50 and PGU series 20 mm ammunition.

==History==
The M197 went into service on later marks of the AH-1 Cobra, using either the M97 or A/A49E-7 armament subsystems, and was also fitted in a ventral turret on the U.S. Marine Corps YOV-10D Bronco NOGS. It is also the basis of the GPU-2/A gun pod, which incorporates the cannon, a battery and electric drive motor, and 300 rounds of linkless ammunition.

In the Cobra, the weapon is supplied with a magazine of 700 linked rounds, with a total capacity including feeder system of 750 rounds. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 730+-50 rounds per minute. Standard practice is to fire the cannon in 30- to 50-round bursts. With extended automatic firing from a hover, the recoil is sufficient that the application of forward cyclic to maintain one&#x27;s position over the ground is inadequate.

The M197 remains in use in the latest AH-1W Cobra and AH-1Z Viper gunships. Although the weapon&#x27;s rotary drive is theoretically quite reliable, its ammunition feed has been anything but: Marine pilots initially reported an alarmingly high jam rate (sometimes greater than 30%). The USMC and the manufacturer are aware of the problem and in 2011 a linkless feed system developed by Meggit Defense Systems was incorporated into the AH-1W and the Zulus. The system is capable of holding 650 +/-3 rounds in the storage unit with approximately 40 rounds in the feed chute.

The M197 is also mounted as a chin turret in Italy&#x27;s Agusta A129 Mangusta CBT helicopter, with a capacity of 500 rounds.

The M197 is also mounted as a chin turret in South Korea&#x27;s KAI LAH helicopter.
The M197 was also mounted into the AU-23A as a handheld Door gun.

The XM301 was an improved M197 intended to be the gun on the later canceled RAH-66 Comanche.

The weapon&#x27;s current contractor is General Dynamics Armament Systems.

Iran has claimed downing one Iraqi MiG-21 fighter on 14 February 1986 during the Iran–Iraq War using the M197 gun turret installed on its AH-1J Internationals. The cannon was also used during the &quot;dogfights&quot; between Iranian AH-1Js and Iraqi helicopters (usually Mi-24s and Gazelles).

<text>Gatka (; ; ; ) is a form of martial art associated primarily with the Sikhs of the Punjab and other related ethnic groups, such as Hindkowans. It is a style of stick-fighting, with wooden sticks intended to simulate swords. The Punjabi name, , refers to the wooden stick used and this term might have originated as a diminutive of a Sanskrit word, , meaning &quot;mace&quot;.

The stick used in Gatka is made of wood and is usually long, with a thickness of around . It comes with a fitted leather hilt, and is often decorated with Punjabi-style multi-coloured threads.

The other weapon used in the sport is a shield, natively known as . It is round in shape, measuring , and is made of dry leather. It is filled with either cotton or dry grass to protect the hand of player in case of full contact hit by an opponent.

Gatka originated in the Punjab in the 15th century. There has been a revival during the later 20th century, with an International Gatka Federation was founded in 1982 and formalized in 1987, and gatka is now popular as a sport or sword dance performance art and is often shown during Sikh festivals.

==History==
Gatka&#x27;s theory and techniques were taught by the Sikh gurus. It has been handed down in an unbroken lineage of ustāds (masters), and taught in many akharas (arenas) around the world. Gatka was employed in the Sikh wars and has been thoroughly battle-tested. It originates from the need to defend (righteousness), but is also based on the unification of the spirit and body: miri piri). It is, therefore, generally considered to be both a spiritual and physical practice.

After the Second Anglo-Sikh War, the art was banned by the new British administrators of India in the mid-19th century. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Sikhs assisted the British in crushing the mutiny. As a consequence of this assistance, restrictions on fighting practices were relaxed, but the Punjabi martial arts which re-emerged after 1857 had changed significantly. The new style applied the sword-fighting techniques to the wooden training-stick. It was referred to as , after its primary weapon. Gatka was used mainly by the British Indian Army in the 1860s as practice for hand-to-hand combat. The Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs of the Government of India has included Gatka, with three other indigenous games, namely , and , as part of the planned Khelo India Youth Games 2021, expected to be held in Haryana. This is a national sports event in India.

The IOA plans to include Gatka in the 37th National Games of India in 2023 held in Goa.

===Competition===
 (meaning &quot;sport&quot; or &quot;game&quot;) is the modern competitive aspect of gatka, originally used as a method of sword-training () or stick-fighting () in medieval times. While gatka is today most commonly associated with Sikhs, it has always been used in the martial arts of other ethno-cultural groups. It is still practiced in India and Pakistan by the Tanoli and Gujjar communities.

==Influence on Defendu==

The Defendu system devised by Captain William E. Fairbairn and Captain Eric Anthony Sykes borrowed methodologies from Gatka, jujutsu, Chinese martial arts and &quot;gutter fighting&quot;. This method was used to train soldiers in close-combat techniques at the Commando Basic Training Centre at Achnacarry in Scotland.

<doc id="574814" wikidata="Q525758" url="?curid=574814" title="Pereiaslav Agreement">
<text>The Pereiaslav Agreement or Pereyaslav Agreement (, ) was an official meeting that convened for a ceremonial pledge of allegiance by Cossacks to the Russian tsar, then Alexis (), in the town of Pereiaslav in central Ukraine, in January 1654. The ceremony took place concurrently with ongoing negotiations that started on the initiative of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky to address the issue of the Cossack Hetmanate with the ongoing Khmelnytsky Uprising against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and which concluded the Treaty of Pereiaslav (also known as the &quot;March Articles&quot;). The treaty itself was finalized in Moscow in April 1654 (in March according to the Julian calendar).

Khmelnytsky secured the military protection of the Tsardom of Russia in exchange for allegiance to the tsar. An oath of allegiance to the Russian monarch from the leadership of the Cossack Hetmanate was taken, shortly thereafter followed by other officials, the clergy and the inhabitants of the Hetmanate swearing allegiance. The exact nature of the relationship stipulated by the agreement between the Hetmanate and Russia is a matter of scholarly controversy. The council of Pereiaslav was followed by an exchange of official documents: the March Articles (from the Cossack Hetmanate) and the tsar&#x27;s declaration (from Russia).

The council was attended by a delegation from Moscow headed by Vasiliy Buturlin. The event was soon thereafter followed by the adoption in Moscow of the so-called that stipulated an autonomous status of the Hetmanate within the Russian state. The agreement precipitated the Russo-Polish War of 1654–1667. The definitive legal settlement was effected under the Treaty of Perpetual Peace in 1686 concluded by Russia and Poland that re-affirmed Russia&#x27;s sovereignty over the lands of Zaporozhian Sich and left-bank Ukraine, as well as the city of Kiev.

==Background of negotiations==
In January 1648, a major anti-Polish uprising led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky began in the Zaporizhia lands. Supported by popular masses and by Crimean Khanate the rebels won a number of victories over the government forces of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth seeking the increase of Cossack registry (kept at the expense of the state treasury), weakening of the Polish aristocratic oppression, oppression by the Jews who governed estates as well as recovery of positions of the Orthodox Church in own lands. However, the autonomy obtained by Khmelnytsky found itself squeezed between three Great powers: the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire.

Being the main leader of the uprising, Bohdan Khmelnytskyi was not able to declare independence because he was not a legitimate monarch, and there was not such a candidate among other leaders of the uprising. Considering the economic and human resources, the rebellion was taking place in regions of the Polish Crown, Kijów (Kyiv), Czernihow (Chernihiv) and Bracław (Bratslav) voivodeships. The Crimean Khan, the only ally, was not interested in a decisive victory of Cossacks.

===Cossack — Moscow negotiations timeline===
It is believed that negotiations to unite the Zaporizhian lands with Russia started as early as in 1648. Such idea is common among Soviet historians of Ukraine and Russia such as Mykola Petrovsky. Many other Ukrainian historians among which are Ivan Krypiakevych, Dmitriy Ilovaisky, Myron Korduba, Valeriy Smoliy and others interpret negotiations as an attempt to attract the tsar to military support of Cossacks and motivate him to struggle for the Polish Crown which became available after the death of Władysław IV Vasa.

* June 18, 1648 – the first known official letter of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi to Tsar Alexis I; it was finished: &quot;So let the God fulfill the prophecy, which was celebrated from ancient times, to which we gave ourselves, and to the merciful feet of your royal majesty, like the lower ones, submit obediently.&quot;
* June 18, 1648 – letter of Khmelnytskyi to the Muscovite voivode of Siveria, Leontiev. Mention of favorable attitude of the Cossacks to the tsar. The issue of allegiance to the tsar is not raised.
* July 21, 1648 – letter of Khmelnytskyi to the Muscovite voivode of Putivl, Pleshcheyev. Mention of motivation of the Russian tsar to the struggle for the Polish Crown. The issue of allegiance to the tsar is not raised.
* end of December 1648 – departing of Khmelnytskyi delegation to Moscow. The delegation included the chief envoy Syluyan Muzhylovsky and Patriarch Paisius I of Jerusalem.
* January 1649 – in Moscow, Patriarch Paisius convinced the tsar of Khmelnytskyi&#x27;s intentions &quot;...striking with forehead to your Imperial Majesty, so the emperor ordered to grant him, Khmelnytskyi and all the Zaporizhian Host adoption under His high imperial hand...&quot;, but in the Muzhylovsky&#x27;s notes is mentioned only request for military assistance, while the issue of allegiance to the Tsar was not raised.
* April 1649 – meeting of Khmelnytskyi with the tsar&#x27;s envoy Grigoriy Unkovsky in Chyhyryn. Hetman emphasized on the kinship of Ukraine with Moscow: &quot;...from the baptizing by St.Vladimir we had with Moscow our one pious Christian faith and one power...&quot; and asked for military assistance.
* May 1649 – deportation of Khmelnytskyi&#x27;s envoys to Moscow headed by Chyhyryn Colonel Fedir Veshnyak. In accreditation letter it was expressed petition for protectorate of the Russian tsar. &quot;...take under own mercy and defense... whole Ruthenia&quot; At the same time, similar delegation was sent to the Prince of Transylvania George II Rákóczi to encourage him to fight for the Polish Crown.
* August 16, 1649 – hollow victory at the Battle of Zboriv. Betrayed by Crimean Tatars, Bohdan Khmelnytskyi blamed Moscow for not sending help. Cossack-Moscow relations worsened. Hetman and his associates resorted to diplomatic pressure on Moscow: openly expressed about the need for campaign onto the Muscovites, and refused to give impostor Timofey Akudinov who claimed to be the son of Moscow Tsar Vasili IV of Russia.
* March 1650 – Khmelnytskyi ignored orders of the king of Poland on preparations to a shared Polish-Crimean campaign against Moscow.
* Summer-fall of 1650 – revival of the Turkish-Ukrainian dialogue to transfer under the Ottoman protectorate: &quot;... Ukraine, White Ruthenia, Volhynia, Podolie with whole Ruthenia all the way to Wisla...&quot;
* March 1, 1651 – Zemsky Sobor in Moscow. The Moscow clergy found it possible in case of not following by the Polish side conditions of the Eternal Peace permit Alexis Mikhailovich to adopt the Zaporizhian Host as one of his subjects.
* September 1651 – Osman-aga, an Ottoman envoy, arrived to Chyhyryn, and informed about readiness of the High Porte to take Ukraine under its protection. Khmelnytskyi did not rush anticipating the Moscow&#x27;s answer.
* March 1652 – Khmelnytskyi&#x27;s envoys in Moscow. Envoy Ivan Iskra proposed immediately to take the Zaporizhian Host under the tsar&#x27;s custody. The tsar&#x27;s government agreed to take only the army without the territory anticipating in the future give it lands in the interfluve of Don and Medveditsa.

==Preparations for official meeting==
On October 1, 1653, the Zemsky Sobor that took place in Moscow in the fall adopted the decision on including Ukraine to the Russian state, and on November 2, 1653, the Moscow government declared war on the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. To conduct negotiations between two states, a large delegation headed by the boyar Vasili Buturlin departed from Moscow to Ukraine. In its composition were also &quot;okolnichiy&quot; I. Olferiev, &quot;dyak&quot; L. Lopukhin and representatives of the clergy.

The travel took almost three months. Besides bad roads and disorder, a new royal standard had to be made, the Buturlin&#x27;s speech text, and the mace (bulawa) designated to Hetman disappeared several precious stones that had to be recovered. Also, the delegation had to wait almost a week for arrival of Bohdan Khmelnytskyi, who was delayed in Chyhyryn at the burial of his older son Tymofiy Khmelnytsky and later was not able to cross the Dnieper since the ice on the river was not strong enough.

==Pereiaslav meeting and the autonomous Cossack state==

At a meeting between the council of Zaporozhian Cossacks and Vasiliy Buturlin, representative of Tsar Alexis I of Russia, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising. The Pereiaslav Council of Ukrainians took place on January 18; it was meant to act as the supreme Cossack council and demonstrate the unity and determination of the &quot;Rus&#x27; nation&quot;. Military leaders and representatives of regiments, nobles and townspeople listened to the speech by the Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, who expounded the necessity of seeking the Russian protection. The audience responded with applause and consent. The treaty, initiated with Buturlin later on the same day, invoked only protection of the Cossack state by the tsar and was intended as an act of official separation of Ukraine from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Ukrainian independence had been informally declared earlier in the course of the Uprising by Khmelnytsky). Participants in the preparation of the treaty at Pereiaslav included, besides Khmelnytsky, Chief Scribe Ivan Vyhovsky and numerous other Cossack elders, as well as a large visiting contingent from Russia.

The Cossack leaders tried in vain to exact from Buturlin some binding declarations; the envoy refused, claiming lack of authority and deferred resolution of specific issues to future rulings by the tsar, which he expected to be favourable to the Cossacks. Khmelnytsky and many Ukrainians (127,000 total, including 64,000 Cossacks, according to the Russian reckoning) ended up swearing allegiance to the Tsar. In many Ukrainian towns, residents were forced to go to the central square to take the oath. Part of the Orthodox clergy took the oath only after a long resistance, and some Cossack leaders did not take the oath. The actual details of the agreement were negotiated the following March and April in Moscow by Cossack emissaries and the Tsardom. The Russians agreed to the majority of the Ukrainian demands, granting the Cossack state broad autonomy, large Cossack register and preservation of the status of the Kiev Orthodox Metropolitan, who would keep reporting to the Patriarch of Constantinople (rather than Moscow). The Cossack hetman was prohibited from conducting independent foreign policy, especially in respect to the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire, as the Tsardom pledged now to provide the Hetmanate&#x27;s defense. The status of Ukraine, seen by the negotiators as being now in union with the Russian state (rather than Poland), was thus settled. The erroneous but stubborn policies of the Commonwealth are widely seen as the cause of the Cossacks&#x27; changed direction, which gave rise to a new and lasting configuration of power in central, eastern and southern Europe.

The seemingly generous provisions of the Pereiaslav-Moscow pact were soon undermined by practical politics, Moscow&#x27;s imperial policies and Khmelnytsky&#x27;s own maneuvering. Disappointed by the Truce of Vilna (1656) and other Russian moves, he attempted to extricate the Hetmanate from the dependency. The Pereyaslav treaty led to the outbreak of the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667) and in 1667 to the Truce of Andrusovo, in which eastern Ukraine was ceded by Poland to Russia (in practice it meant a limited recovery of western Ukraine by the Commonwealth). The Cossack Hetmanate, the autonomous Ukrainian state established by Khmelnytsky, was later restricted to left-bank Ukraine and existed under the Russian Empire until it was destroyed by Russia in 1764-1775.

The contemporary written records of the Pereiaslav-Moscow transactions do exist and are kept in the Russian State Archive of Ancient Acts in Moscow.

==Historical consequences==
 
The eventual consequence for the Hetmanate was the dissolution of the Zaporizhian Host in 1775 and the imposition of serfdom in the region.

For Russia, the deal eventually led to the full incorporation of the Cossack Hetmanate into the Russian state, providing a justification for the title of Russian tsars and emperors, the &quot;autocrat of all Russia&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Russia, being at that time the only part of former Kievan Rus&#x27; which was not dominated by a foreign power, considered itself the successor of Kievan Rus&#x27; and the re-unifier of all the lands of Rus&#x27;. Subsequently, in the 20th century, in Soviet history and epistemology, the Council of Pereiaslav was viewed and referred to as an act of &quot;re-unification of Ukraine with Russia&quot;.

The treaty was a political plan to save Ukraine from Polish domination. For the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the deal provided one of the early signs of its gradual decline and eventual demise by the end of the 18th century.

In 1954, anniversary celebrations of &quot;Ukraine&#x27;s re-unification with Russia&quot; were widespread in the Soviet Union and included the transfer of Crimea from the Russian Federation to Ukraine.

In 2004, after the celebration of the 350th anniversary of the event, the administration of President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine established January 18 as the official date to commemorate the event.

The decision adopted in Pereiaslav is viewed by Ukrainian nationalists negatively as a failed opportunity for Ukrainian independence. Since then, Ukrainian independence during the Russian Civil War was short-lived as a result of the Ukrainian–Soviet War, with the country achieving independence during the dissolution of the USSR. Pro-Russian Ukrainian parties celebrate the date of this event and renew calls for re-unification of the three East Slavic nations: Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

In 2023, Polish president Andrzej Duda suggested to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy the idea of bringing the Russians to Pereiaslav following a hypothetical Russian defeat during the Russian invasion of Ukraine for the signal of a peace treaty.

<doc id="574818" wikidata="Q156075" url="?curid=574818" title="Orbit (anatomy)">
<text>In anatomy, the orbit is the cavity or socket/hole of the skull in which the eye and its appendages are situated. &quot;Orbit&quot; can refer to the bony socket, or it can also be used to imply the contents. In the adult human, the volume of the orbit is about , of which the eye occupies . The orbital contents comprise the eye, the orbital and retrobulbar fascia, extraocular muscles, cranial nerves II, III, IV, V, and VI, blood vessels, fat, the lacrimal gland with its sac and duct, the eyelids, medial and lateral palpebral ligaments, cheek ligaments, the suspensory ligament, septum, ciliary ganglion and short ciliary nerves.

== Structure ==

The orbits are conical or four-sided pyramidal cavities, which open into the midline of the face and point back into the head. Each consists of a base, an apex and four walls.

===Openings===
There are two important foramina, or windows, two important fissures, or grooves, and one canal surrounding the globe in the orbit. There is a supraorbital foramen, an infraorbital foramen, a superior orbital fissure, an inferior orbital fissure and the optic canal, each of which contains structures that are crucial to normal eye functioning. The supraorbital foramen contains the supraorbital nerve, the first division of the trigeminal nerve or V1 and lies just lateral to the frontal sinus. The infraorbital foramen contains the second division of the trigeminal nerve, the infraorbital nerve or V2, and sits on the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus. Both foramina are crucial as potential pathways for cancer and infections of the orbit to spread into the brain or other deep facial structures.

The optic canal contains the (cranial nerve II) and the ophthalmic artery, and sits at the junction of the sphenoid sinus with the ethmoid air cells, superomedial and posterior to structures at the orbital apex. It provides a pathway between the orbital contents and the middle cranial fossa. The superior orbital fissure lies just lateral and inferior to the optic canal, and is formed at the junction of the lesser and greater wing of the sphenoid bone. It is a major pathway for intracranial communication, containing cranial nerves III, IV, VI which control eye movement via the extraocular muscles, and the ophthalmic branches of cranial nerve V, or V1. The second division of the trigeminal nerve enters the skull base at the foramen rotundum, or V2. The inferior orbital fissure lies inferior and lateral to the ocular globe at the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus. It is not as important in function, though it does contain a few branches of the maxillary nerve and the infraorbital artery and vein. Other minor structures in the orbit include the anterior and posterior ethmoidal foramen and zygomatic orbital foramen.

===Bony walls===

The bony walls of the orbital canal in humans do not derive from a single bone, but a mosaic of seven embryologically distinct structures: the zygomatic bone laterally, the sphenoid bone, with its lesser wing forming the optic canal and its greater wing forming the lateral posterior portion of the bony orbital process, the maxillary bone inferiorly and medially which, along with the lacrimal and ethmoid bones, forms the medial wall of the orbital canal. The ethmoid air cells are extremely thin, and form a structure known as the lamina papyracea, the most delicate bony structure in the skull, and one of the most commonly fractured bones in orbital trauma. The lacrimal bone also contains the nasolacrimal duct. The superior bony margin of the orbital rim, otherwise known as the orbital process, is formed by the frontal bone.

The roof (superior wall) is formed primarily by the orbital plate frontal bone, and also the lesser wing of sphenoid near the apex of the orbit. The orbital surface presents medially by trochlear fovea and laterally by lacrimal fossa.

The floor (inferior wall) is formed by the orbital surface of maxilla, the orbital surface of zygomatic bone and the minute orbital process of palatine bone. Medially, near the orbital margin, is located the groove for nasolacrimal duct. Near the middle of the floor, located infraorbital groove, which leads to the infraorbital foramen. The floor is separated from the lateral wall by inferior orbital fissure, which connects the orbit to pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossa.

The medial wall is formed primarily by the orbital plate of ethmoid, as well as contributions from the frontal process of maxilla, the lacrimal bone, and a small part of the body of the sphenoid. It is the thinnest wall of the orbit, evidenced by pneumatized ethmoidal cells.

The lateral wall is formed by the frontal process of zygomatic and more posteriorly by the orbital plate of the greater wing of sphenoid. The bones meet at the zygomaticosphenoid suture. The lateral wall is the thickest wall of the orbit, important because it is the most exposed surface, highly vulnerable to blunt force trauma.

===Borders===
The base, orbital margin, which opens in the face, has four borders. The following bones take part in their formation:
# Superior margin: frontal bone
# Inferior margin: maxilla and zygomatic bone
# Medial margin: frontal bone and maxilla
# Lateral margin: zygomatic bone and frontal bone

==Function==
The orbit holds and protects the eyes.

===Eye movement===

The movement of the eye is controlled by six distinct extraocular muscles, a superior, an inferior, a medial and a lateral rectus, as well as a superior and an inferior oblique. The superior ophthalmic vein is a sigmoidal vessel along the superior margin of the orbital canal that drains deoxygenated blood from surrounding musculature. The ophthalmic artery is a crucial structure in the orbit, as it is often the only source of collateral blood to the brain in cases of large internal carotid infarcts, as it is a collateral pathway to the circle of Willis. In addition, there is the optic canal, which contains the optic nerve, or cranial nerve II, and is formed entirely by the lesser wing of the sphenoid, separated from the supraorbital fissure by the optic strut. Injury to any one of these structures by infection, trauma or neoplasm can cause temporary or permanent visual dysfunction, and even blindness if not promptly corrected. The orbits also protect the eye from mechanical injury.

==Clinical significance==
In the orbit, the surrounding fascia allows for smooth rotation and protects the orbital contents. If excessive tissue accumulates behind the ocular globe, the eye can protrude, or become exophthalmic.

Enlargement of the lacrimal gland, located superotemporally within the orbit, produces protrusion of the eye inferiorly and medially (away from the location of the lacrimal gland). Lacrimal gland may be enlarged from inflammation (e.g. sarcoid) or neoplasm (e.g. lymphoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma).

Tumors (e.g. glioma and meningioma of the optic nerve) within the cone formed by the horizontal rectus muscles produce axial protrusion (bulging forward) of the eye.

Graves disease may also cause axial protrusion of the eye, known as Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy, due to buildup of extracellular matrix proteins and fibrosis in the rectus muscles. Development of Graves&#x27; ophthalmopathy may be independent of thyroid function.

<doc id="574821" wikidata="Q378505" url="?curid=574821" title="Legitimacy (family law)">
<text>Legitimacy, in traditional Western common law, is the status of a child born to parents who are legally married to each other, and of a child conceived before the parents obtain a legal divorce. Conversely, &quot;illegitimacy&quot;, also known as &quot;bastardy&quot;, has been the status of a child born outside marriage, such a child being known as a bastard, a love child, a natural child, or illegitimate. In Scots law, the terms natural son and natural daughter carry the same implications.

The importance of legitimacy has decreased substantially in Western developed countries since the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s and the declining influence of Christian churches, especially Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches, in family and social life. 

A 2009 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that in 2007, a substantial proportion of births in the U.S. and in several European nations occurred outside marriage.

==Law==
England&#x27;s Statute of Merton (1235) stated, regarding illegitimacy: &quot;He is a bastard that is born before the marriage of his parents.&quot; This definition also applied to situations when a child&#x27;s parents could not marry, as when one or both were already married or when the relationship was incestuous.

The Poor Act 1575 formed the basis of English bastardy law. Its purpose was to punish a bastard child&#x27;s mother and putative father, and to relieve the parish from the cost of supporting mother and child. &quot;By an act of 1576 (18 Elizabeth C. 3), it was ordered that bastards should be supported by their putative fathers, though bastardy orders in the quarter sessions date from before this date. If the genitor could be found, then he was put under very great pressure to accept responsibility and to maintain the child.&quot;

Under English law, a bastard could not inherit real property and could not be legitimized by the subsequent marriage of father to mother. There was one exception: when his father subsequently married his mother, and an older illegitimate son (a &quot;bastard eignè&quot;) took possession of his father&#x27;s lands after his death, he would pass the land on to his own heirs on his death, as if his possession of the land had been retroactively converted into true ownership. A younger non-bastard brother (a &quot;mulier puisnè&quot;) would have no claim to the land.

There were many &quot;natural children&quot; of Scotland&#x27;s monarchy granted positions which founded prominent families. In the 14th century, Robert II of Scotland gifted one of his illegitimate sons estates in Bute, founding the Stewarts of Bute, and similarly a natural son of Robert III of Scotland was ancestral to the Shaw Stewarts of Greenock.

In Scots law an illegitimate child, a &quot;natural son&quot; or &quot;natural daughter&quot;, would be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents, provided they had been free to marry at the date of the conception. The Legitimation (Scotland) Act 1968 extended legitimation by the subsequent marriage of the parents to children conceived when their parents were not free to marry, but this was repealed in 2006 by the amendment of section 1 of the Law Reform (Parent and Child) (Scotland) Act 1986 (as amended in 2006) which abolished the status of illegitimacy stating that &quot;(1) No person whose status is governed by Scots law shall be illegitimate ...&quot;.

The Legitimacy Act 1926 of England and Wales legitimised the birth of a child if the parents subsequently married each other, provided that they had not been married to someone else in the meantime. The Legitimacy Act 1959 extended the legitimisation even if the parents had married others in the meantime and applied it to putative marriages which the parents incorrectly believed were valid. Neither the 1926 nor 1959 Acts changed the laws of succession to the British throne and succession to peerage and baronetcy titles. In Scotland children legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their parents have always been entitled to succeed to peerages and baronetcies and the Legitimation (Scotland) Act 1968 extended this right to children conceived when their parents were not free to marry. The Family Law Reform Act 1969 (c. 46) allowed a bastard to inherit on the intestacy of his parents. In canon and in civil law, the offspring of putative marriages have also been considered legitimate.

Since December 2003 in England and Wales, April 2002 in Northern Ireland and May 2006 in Scotland, an unmarried father has parental responsibility if he is listed on the birth certificate.

In the United States, in the early 1970s a series of Supreme Court decisions held that most common-law disabilities imposed upon illegitimacy were invalid as violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Still, children born out of wedlock may not be eligible for certain federal benefits (e.g., automatic naturalization when the father becomes a US citizen) unless the child has been legitimized in the appropriate jurisdiction.

Many other countries have legislatively abolished any legal disabilities of a child born out of wedlock.

In France, legal reforms regarding illegitimacy began in the 1970s, but it was only in the 21st century that the principle of equality was fully upheld (through Act no. 2002-305 of 4 March 2002, removing mention of &quot;illegitimacy&quot; — &quot;filiation légitime&quot; and &quot;filiation naturelle&quot;; and through law no. 2009-61 of 16 January 2009). In 2001, France was forced by the European Court of Human Rights to change several laws that were deemed discriminatory, and in 2013 the Court ruled that these changes must also be applied to children born before 2001.

In some countries, the family law itself explicitly states that there must be equality between the children born outside and inside marriage: in Bulgaria, for example, the new 2009 Family Code lists &quot;equality of the born during the matrimony, out of matrimony and of the adopted children&quot; as one of the principles of family law.

The &quot;European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock&quot; came into force in 1978. Countries which ratify it must ensure that children born outside marriage are provided with legal rights as stipulated in the text of this convention. The convention was ratified by the UK in 1981 and by Ireland in 1988.

In later years, the inheritance rights of many illegitimate children have improved, and changes of laws have allowed them to inherit properties. More recently, the laws of England have been changed to allow illegitimate children to inherit entailed property, over their legitimate brothers and sisters.

==Contemporary situation==
Despite the decreasing legal relevance of illegitimacy, an important exception may be found in the nationality laws of many countries, which do not apply &quot;jus sanguinis&quot; (nationality by citizenship of a parent) to children born out of wedlock, particularly in cases where the child&#x27;s connection to the country lies only through the father. This is true, for example, of the United States, and its constitutionality was upheld in 2001 by the Supreme Court in &quot;Nguyen v. INS&quot;. In the UK, the policy was changed so that children born after 1 July 2006 could receive British citizenship from their father if their parents were unmarried at the time of the child&#x27;s birth; illegitimate children born before this date cannot receive British citizenship through their father.

Legitimacy also continues to be relevant to hereditary titles, with only legitimate children being admitted to the line of succession. Some monarchs, however, have succeeded to the throne despite the controversial status of their legitimacy. For example, Elizabeth I succeeded to the throne though she was legally held illegitimate as a result of her parents&#x27; marriage having been annulled after her birth. Her older half-sister Mary I had acceded to the throne before her in a similar circumstance: her parents&#x27; marriage had been annulled in order to allow her father to marry Elizabeth&#x27;s mother.

Annulment of marriage does not currently change the status of legitimacy of children born to the couple during their putative marriage, &quot;i.e.&quot;, between their marriage ceremony and the legal annulment of their marriage. For example, canon 1137 of the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s Code of Canon Law specifically affirms the legitimacy of a child born to a marriage that is declared null following the child&#x27;s birth.

The Catholic Church is also changing its attitude toward unwed mothers and baptism of the children. In criticizing the priests who refused to baptize out-of-wedlock children, Pope Francis argued that the mothers had done the right thing by giving life to the child and should not be shunned by the church:
==Nonmarital births==


The proportion of children born outside marriage has been rising since the turn of the 21st century in most European Union countries, North America, and Australia. In Europe, besides the low levels of fertility rates and the delay of motherhood, another factor that now characterizes fertility is the growing percentage of births outside marriage. In the EU, this phenomenon has been on the rise in recent years in almost every country; and in eight EU countries, mostly in northern Europe, as well as in Iceland outside of the EU, it already accounts for the majority of births.

In 2009, 41% of children born in the United States were born to unmarried mothers, a significant increase from the 5% of half a century earlier. That includes 73% of non-Hispanic black children, 53% of Hispanic children (of all races), and 29% of non-Hispanic white children. In 2020, the proportion was almost similar, with 40.5% of children born in the United States being born to unmarried mothers.

In April 2009, the National Center for Health Statistics announced that nearly 40 percent of American infants born in 2007 were born to an unwed mother; that of 4.3 million children, 1.7 million were born to unmarried parents, a 25 percent increase from 2002. Most births to teenagers in the United States (86% in 2007) are nonmarital; in 2007, 60% of births to women 20–24, and nearly one-third of births to women 25–29, were nonmarital. In 2007, teenagers accounted for just 23% of non-marital births, down steeply from 50% in 1970.

In 2014, 42% of all births in the 28 EU countries were nonmarital. The percentage was also 42% in 2018. In 2018, births outside of marriage represented the majority of births in eight EU member states: France (60%), Bulgaria (59%), Slovenia (58%), Portugal (56%), Sweden (55%), Denmark and Estonia (both 54%), and the Netherlands (52%). The lowest percentage were in Greece, Cyprus, Croatia, Poland and Lithuania, with a percentage of under 30%. 

To a certain degree, religion (the religiosity of the population - see religion in Europe) correlates with the proportion of non-marital births (e.g., Greece, Cyprus, Croatia have a low percentage of births outside marriage), but this is not always the case: Portugal (56% in 2018) is among the most religious countries in Europe.

The proportion of non-marital births is also approaching half in the Czech Republic (48.5%. in 2021), the United Kingdom (48.2% as of 2017) and Hungary (46.7% as of 2016).

The prevalence of births to unmarried women varies not only between different countries, but also between different geographical areas of the same country: for example, in Germany, there are very strong differences between the regions of former West Germany and East Germany with a non-religious majority. Significantly more children are born out of wedlock in eastern Germany than in western Germany. In 2012, in eastern Germany 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, while in western Germany only 28.4% were. In the UK, in 2014, 59.4% of births were non-marital in North East of England, 58.9% in Wales, 54.2% in North West England, 52.4% in Yorkshire and the Humber, 52% in East Midlands, 50.8% in Scotland, 50.4% in West Midlands, 48.5% in South West England, 45.5% in East of England, 43.2% in Northern Ireland, 42.9% in South East England, and 35.7% in London.

In France, in 2012, 66.9% of births were non-marital in Poitou-Charentes, while only 46.6% were in Ile-de-France (which contains Paris). One of the reasons for the lower prevalence of non-marital births in the metropolis is the high number of immigrants from conservative world regions. In Canada, in Quebec, the majority of births since 1995 onwards have been outside marriage. As of 2015, 63% of births were outside marriage in Quebec.

Traditionally conservative Catholic countries in the EU now also have substantial proportions of non-marital births, as of 2016 (except where otherwise stated): Portugal (52.8% ), Spain (45.9%), Austria (41.7%), Luxembourg (40.7%) Slovakia (40.2%), Ireland (36.5%), Malta (31.8%)

The percentage of first-born children born out of wedlock is considerably higher (by roughly 10%, for the EU), as marriage often takes place after the first baby has arrived. For example, for the Czech Republic, whereas the total nonmarital births are less than half, 47.7%, (third quarter of 2015) the percentage of first-born outside marriage is more than half, 58.2%.

In Australia, in 1971, only 7% of births were outside of marriage, compared to 36% in 2020. The proportion of births outside of marriage was the highest in the Northern Territory (59%) and the lowest in the ACT (28%).

Latin America has the highest rates of non-marital childbearing in the world (55–74% of all children in this region are born to unmarried parents). In most countries in this traditionally Catholic region, children born outside marriage are now the norm. Recent figures from Latin America show non-marital births to be 74% in Colombia, 70% in Paraguay, 69% in Peru, 63% in the Dominican Republic, 58% in Argentina, 55% in Mexico. In Brazil, non-marital births increased to 65.8% in 2009, up from 56.2% in 2000. In Chile, non-marital births increased to 70.7% in 2013, up from 48.3% in 2000.

Even in the early 1990s, the phenomenon was very common in Latin America. For example, in 1993, out-of-wedlock births in Mexico were 41.5%, in Chile 43.6%, in Puerto Rico 45.8%, in Costa Rica 48.2%, in Argentina 52.7%, in Belize 58.1%, in El Salvador 73%, in Suriname 66%, and in Panama 80%.

Out-of-wedlock births are less common in Asia: in 1993 the rate in Japan was 1.4%; in Israel, 3.1%; in China, 5.6%; in Uzbekistan, 6.4%; in Kazakhstan, 21%; and in Kyrgyzstan, 24%. However, in the Philippines, the out-of-wedlock birth rate was 37% in 2008–2009, which skyrocketed to 52.1% by 2015.

==Covert illegitimacy==
Covert illegitimacy is a situation which arises when someone who is presumed to be a child&#x27;s father (or mother) is in fact not the biological father (or mother). Frequencies as high as 30% are sometimes assumed in the media, but research by sociologist Michael Gilding traced these overestimates back to an informal remark at a 1972 conference.

The detection of unsuspected illegitimacy can occur in the context of medical genetic screening, in genetic family name research, and in immigration testing. Such studies show that covert illegitimacy is in fact less than 10% among the sampled African populations, less than 5% among the sampled Native American and Polynesian populations, less than 2% of the sampled Middle Eastern population, and generally 1%–2% among European samples.

==Causes for rise in nonmarital births==
The rise in illegitimacy noted in Britain throughout the eighteenth century has been associated with the rise of new employment opportunities for women, making them less dependent upon a husband&#x27;s earnings. However, the Marriage Act 1753 sought to curb this practice, by combining the spousals and nuptials; and by the start of the 19th century, social convention prescribed that brides be virgins at marriage, and illegitimacy became more socially discouraged, especially during the Victorian era. Later in the 20th century, the social changes of the 1960s and 1970s started to reverse this trend, with an increase in cohabitation and alternative family formation. Elsewhere in Europe and Latin America, the increase in nonmarital births from the late 20th century on has been linked to secularization, enhanced women&#x27;s rights and standing in society, and the fall of authoritarian dictatorships.

Before the dissolution of Marxist–Leninist regimes in Europe, women&#x27;s participation in the workforce was actively encouraged by most governments, but socially conservative regimes such as that of Nicolae Ceausescu practiced restrictive and natalist policies regarding family reproduction, such as total bans on contraception and abortion, and birth rates were tightly controlled by the state. After the dissolution of those regimes, the population was given more choices on how to organize their personal lives, and in regions such as former East Germany, the rate of births outside marriage increased dramatically: as of 2012, 61.6% of births there were outside marriage. Far-right regimes such as those of Francoist Spain and Portugal&#x27;s &quot;Estado Novo&quot; also fell, leading to the democratization and liberalization of society. In Spain and Portugal, important legal changes throughout the 1970s and 1980s included legalization of divorce, decriminalization of adultery, introduction of gender equality in family law, and removal of the ban on contraception.

In many countries there has been a dissociation between marriage and fertility, with the two no longer being closely associated—with births to unmarried couples, as well as childless married couples, becoming more common and more socially acceptable. Contributions to these societal changes have been made by the weakening of social and legal norms that regulate peoples&#x27; personal lives and relations, especially in regard to marriage, secularization and decreased church control of reproduction, increased participation of women in the labor force, changes in the meaning of marriage, risk reduction, individualism, changing views on female sexuality, and availability of contraception. New concepts have emerged, such as that of reproductive rights, though these concepts have not been accepted by all cultures. Under the notions of reproductive and sexual rights, individuals—not the state, church, community, etc.—shall decide whether and when individuals shall have children, their number and spacing, the circumstances under which individuals will or will not be sexually active, and their choice of intimate partners and type of relationship.

It is argued that in some places where the control of the church (especially the Roman Catholic Church) was traditionally very strong, the social changes of the 1960s and 1970s have led to a negative reaction of the population against the lifestyles promoted by the church. One of the explanations of the current high rates of unmarried cohabitation in Quebec is that the traditionally strong social control of the church and the Catholic doctrine over people&#x27;s private relations and sexual morality has led the population to rebel against traditional and conservative social values; since 1995 the majority of births in this province are outside marriage, and as of 2015, in Quebec, 63% of children were born to unmarried women. The past few decades have seen decreased marriage rates in most Western countries, and this decrease has been accompanied by increased emergence of non-traditional family forms. Average marriage rates across OECD countries have fallen from 8.1 marriages per 1,000 people in 1970 to 5.0 in 2009.

Research on the situation in Bulgaria has concluded that:

==History==

Certainty of paternity has been considered important in a wide range of eras and cultures, especially when inheritance and citizenship were at stake, making the tracking of a man&#x27;s estate and genealogy a central part of what defined a &quot;legitimate&quot; birth. The ancient Latin dictum, &quot;Mater semper certa est&quot; (&quot;The [identity of the] mother is always certain&quot;, while the father is not), emphasized the dilemma.

In English common law, Justice Edward Coke in 1626 promulgated the &quot;Four Seas Rule&quot; (&quot;extra quatuor maria&quot;) asserting that, absent impossibility of the father being fertile, there was a presumption of paternity that a married woman&#x27;s child was her husband&#x27;s child. That presumption could be questioned, though courts generally sided with the presumption, thus expanding the range of the presumption to a &quot;Seven Seas Rule&quot;. But it was only with the Marriage Act 1753 that a formal and public marriage ceremony at civil law was required, whereas previously marriage had a if celebrated in an Anglican church. Still, many &quot;clandestine&quot; marriages occurred.

In many societies, people born out of wedlock did not have the same rights of inheritance as those within it, and in some societies, even the same civil rights. In the United Kingdom and the United States, as late as the 1960s and in certain social strata even up to today, nonmarital birth has carried a social stigma. In previous centuries unwed mothers were socially pressured to give their children up for adoption. In other cases nonmarital children have been reared by grandparents or married relatives as the &quot;sisters&quot;, &quot;brothers&quot; or &quot;cousins&quot; of the unwed mothers.

In most national jurisdictions, the status of a child as a legitimate or illegitimate heir could be changed—in either direction—under the civil law: A legislative act could deprive a child of legitimacy; conversely, a marriage between the previously unmarried parents, usually within a specified time, such as a year, could retroactively legitimate a child&#x27;s birth.

Fathers of illegitimate children often did not incur comparable censure or legal responsibility, due to social attitudes about sex, the nature of sexual reproduction, and the difficulty of determining paternity with certainty.

By the final third of the 20th century, in the United States, all the states had adopted uniform laws that codified the responsibility of both parents to provide support and care for a child, regardless of the parents&#x27; marital status, and gave non-marital as well as adopted persons equal rights to inherit their parents&#x27; property. In the early 1970s, a series of Supreme Court decisions abolished most, if not all, of the common-law disabilities of non-marital birth, as being violations of the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Generally speaking, in the United States, &quot;illegitimate&quot; has been supplanted by the phrase &quot;born out of wedlock.&quot;

In contrast, other jurisdictions (particularly western continental European countries) tend to favour social parentage over the biological parentage. Here a man (not necessarily the biological father) may voluntarily recognise the child to be identified as the father, thus giving legitimacy to the child; the biological father does not have any special rights in this area. In France, a mother may refuse to recognize her own child (see anonymous birth).

A contribution to the decline of the concept of illegitimacy had been made by increased ease of obtaining divorce. Before this, the mother and father of many children had been unable to marry each other because one or the other was already legally bound, by civil or canon law, in a non-viable earlier marriage that did not permit divorce. Their only recourse, often, had been to wait for the death of the earlier spouse(s). Thus Polish political and military leader Józef Piłsudski (1867–1935) was unable to marry his second wife, Aleksandra, until his first wife, Maria, died in 1921; by this time, Piłsudski and Aleksandra had two out-of-wedlock daughters.

==Social implications==
Nonmarital birth has affected not only the individuals themselves. The stress that such circumstances of birth once regularly visited upon families is illustrated in the case of Albert Einstein and his wife-to-be, Mileva Marić, who—when she became pregnant with the first of their three children, Lieserl—felt compelled to maintain separate domiciles in different cities.
Some persons born outside of marriage have been driven to excel in their endeavors, for good or ill, by a desire to overcome the social stigma and disadvantage that attached to it. Nora Titone, in her book &quot;My Thoughts Be Bloody&quot;, recounts how the shame and ambition of actor Junius Brutus Booth&#x27;s two actor sons born outside of marriage, Edwin Booth and John Wilkes Booth, spurred them to strive, as rivals, for achievement and acclaim—John Wilkes, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, and Edwin, a Unionist who a year earlier had saved the life of Lincoln&#x27;s son, Robert Todd Lincoln, in a railroad accident.
Historian John Ferling, in his book &quot;Jefferson and Hamilton: The Rivalry That Forged a Nation&quot;, makes the same point: that Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s non-marital birth spurred him to seek accomplishment and distinction. The Swedish artist Anders Zorn (1860–1920) was similarly motivated by his non-marital birth to prove himself and excel in his métier.
Similarly, T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s biographer Flora Armitage writes about being born outside of marriage: &quot;The effect on [T. E.] Lawrence of this discovery was profound; it added to the romantic urge for heroic conduct—the dream of the Sangreal—the seed of ambition, the desire for honor and distinction: the redemption of the blood from its taint.&quot; 

Another biographer, John E. Mack, writes in a similar vein: &quot;[H]is mother required of him that he &quot;redeem&quot; her fallen state by his own special achievements, by being a person of unusual value who accomplishes great deeds, preferably religious and ideally on an heroic scale. Lawrence did his best to fulfill heroic deeds. But he was plagued, especially after the events of the war activated his inner conflicts, by a deep sense of failure. Having been deceived as a child he was later to feel that he himself was a deceiver—that he had deceived the Arabs...&quot; &quot;Mrs. Lawrence&#x27;s original hope that her sons would provide her personal redemption by becoming Christian missionaries was fulfilled only by [Lawrence&#x27;s brother] Robert.&quot; 

Mack elaborates further: &quot;Part of his creativity and originality lies in his &#x27;irregularity,&#x27; in his capacity to remain outside conventional ways of thinking, a tendency which... derives, at least in part, from his illegitimacy. Lawrence&#x27;s capacity for invention and his ability to see unusual or humorous relationships in familiar situations come also... from his illegitimacy. He was not limited to established or &#x27;legitimate&#x27; solutions or ways of doing things, and thus his mind was open to a wider range of possibilities and opportunities. [At the same time] Lawrence&#x27;s illegitimacy had important social consequences and placed limitations upon him, which rankled him deeply... At times he felt socially isolated when erstwhile friends shunned him upon learning of his background. Lawrence&#x27;s delight in making fun of regular officers and other segments of &#x27;regular&#x27; society... derived... at least in part from his inner view of his own irregular situation. His fickleness about names for himself [he changed his name twice to distance himself from his &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; persona] is directly related... to his view of his parents and to his identification with them [his father had changed his name after running off with T. E. Lawrence&#x27;s future mother].&quot;
Christopher Columbus&#x27; first son, Diego Columbus (born between 1474 and 1480; died 1526), by Columbus&#x27; wife, Filipa Moniz Perestrelo, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps to become the 2nd Admiral of the Indies, 2nd Viceroy of the Indies, and 4th Governor of the Indies. Columbus&#x27; second son, Fernando Columbus (also known as Hernando; 1488–1539), was his out-of-wedlock son by Beatriz Enríquez de Arana and—while he grew up with a fair amount of power and privilege—due to the circumstances of his birth he never quite gained the prominence his father did. Hernando Columbus&#x27; biographer Edward Wilson-Lee says Hernando &quot;always wanted to prove himself his father&#x27;s son in spirit. [S]o he undertook th[e] extraordinary project [of] building a universal library that would [hold] every book in the world... [H]e very much saw this as a counterpart to his father&#x27;s desire to circumnavigate the world... Hernando was going to build a universal library that would circumnavigate the world of knowledge.&quot; 

However, realizing that such a large collection of books would not be very useful without a way of organizing and distilling them, he employed an army of readers to read every book and distill it down to a short summary, or &quot;epitome&quot;. The result was the &quot;Libro de los Epitomes&quot; (Book of Epitomes). Soon after Hernando&#x27;s death in 1539 at age 50, this volume went missing for nearly 500 years—until in 2019 it was serendipitously discovered in a University of Copenhagen special collection. Many of the early printed publications that the &quot;Book of Epitomes&quot; summarizes are now lost; but thanks to the out-of-wedlock bibliophile Hernando Columbus, eager to emulate in his own way his father and &quot;legitimate&quot; half-brother, invaluable insights are becoming available into the knowledge and thought of the early Modern Period.

In more recent times, Steve Jobs&#x27; adoption due to the nonmarried status of his biological parents influenced his life and career. He confided to close friends that he was driven by the pain he felt about having been put up for adoption and not having known who his birth parents were.

==Violence and honor killings==
While births outside marriage are considered acceptable in many world regions, in some parts of the world they remain highly stigmatized. Women who have given birth under such circumstances are often subjected to violence at the hands of their families; and may even become victims of so-called honor killings. These women may also be prosecuted under laws forbidding sexual relations outside marriage and may face consequent punishments, including stoning.

==In fiction==
Illegitimacy has for centuries provided a motif and plot element to works of fiction by prominent authors, including William Shakespeare, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Fielding, Voltaire, Jane Austen, Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot;, Charles Dickens, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Wilkie Collins, Anthony Trollope, Alexandre Dumas, &quot;fils&quot;, George Eliot, Victor Hugo, Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Thomas Hardy, Alphonse Daudet, Bolesław Prus, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, E. M. Forster, C. S. Forester, Marcel Pagnol, Grace Metalious, John Irving, and George R. R. Martin.

==Notables==
Some pre-20th-century modern individuals whose unconventional &quot;illegitimate&quot; origins did not prevent them from making (and in some cases helped inspire them to make) notable contributions to humanity&#x27;s art or learning have included Leone Battista Alberti (1404–1472), Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Erasmus of Rotterdam 1466–1536), Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert (1717–1783), Alexander Hamilton (1755 or 1757–1804), James Smithson (1764–1829), John James Audubon (1785–1851), Alexander Herzen (1812–1870), Jenny Lind (1820–1887), and Alexandre Dumas, &quot;fils&quot; (1824–1895).

<text>In political science, legitimacy is the right and acceptance of an authority, usually a governing law or a regime. Whereas &quot;authority&quot; denotes a specific position in an established government, the term &quot;legitimacy&quot; denotes a system of government—wherein &quot;government&quot; denotes &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. An authority viewed as legitimate often has the right and justification to exercise power. Political legitimacy is considered a basic condition for governing, without which a government will suffer legislative deadlock(s) and collapse. In political systems where this is not the case, unpopular regimes survive because they are considered legitimate by a small, influential elite. In Chinese political philosophy, since the historical period of the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BC), the political legitimacy of a ruler and government was derived from the Mandate of Heaven, and unjust rulers who lost said mandate therefore lost the right to rule the people.

In moral philosophy, the term &quot;legitimacy&quot; is often positively interpreted as the normative status conferred by a governed people upon their governors&#x27; institutions, offices, and actions, based upon the belief that their government&#x27;s actions are appropriate uses of power by a legally constituted government.

The Enlightenment-era British social John Locke (1632–1704) said that political legitimacy derives from popular explicit and implicit consent of the governed: &quot;The argument of the [&quot;Second&quot;] &quot;Treatise&quot; is that the government is not legitimate unless it is carried on with the consent of the governed.&quot; The German political philosopher Dolf Sternberger said that &quot;[l]egitimacy is the foundation of such governmental power as is exercised, both with a consciousness on the government&#x27;s part that it has a right to govern, and with some recognition by the governed of that right&quot;. The American political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset said that legitimacy also &quot;involves the capacity of a political system to engender and maintain the belief that existing political institutions are the most appropriate and proper ones for the society&quot;. The American political scientist Robert A. Dahl explained legitimacy as a reservoir: so long as the water is at a given level, political stability is maintained, if it falls below the required level, political legitimacy is endangered.

== Types ==
=== Tradition, charisma and rational-legality ===
Legitimacy is &quot;a value whereby something or someone is recognized and accepted as right and proper&quot;. In political science, legitimacy has traditionally been understood as the popular acceptance and recognition by the public of the authority of a governing régime, whereby authority has political power through consent and mutual understandings, not coercion. The three types of political legitimacy described by German sociologist Max Weber, in &quot;Politics as Vocation&quot;, are traditional, charismatic, and rational-legal:
* Traditional legitimacy derives from societal custom and habit that emphasize the history of the authority of tradition. Traditionalists understand this form of rule as historically accepted, hence its continuity, because it is the way society has always been. Therefore, the institutions of traditional government usually are historically continuous, as in monarchy and tribalism.
* Charismatic legitimacy derives from the ideas and personal charisma of the leader, a person whose authoritative persona charms and psychologically dominates the people of the society to agreement with the government&#x27;s régime and rule. A charismatic government usually features weak political and administrative institutions, because they derive authority from the persona of the leader, and usually disappear without the leader in power. However, if the charismatic leader has a successor, a government derived from charismatic legitimacy might continue.
* Rational-legal legitimacy derives from a system of institutional procedure, wherein government institutions establish and enforce law and order in the public interest. Therefore, it is through public trust that the government will abide the law that confers rational-legal legitimacy.
More recent scholarship distinguishes between multiple other types of legitimacy in an effort to draw distinctions between various approaches to the construct. These include empirical legitimacy versus normative legitimacy, instrumental versus substantive legitimacy, popular legitimacy, regulative legitimacy, and procedural legitimacy. Types of legitimacy draw distinctions that account for different sources of legitimacy, different frameworks for evaluating legitimacy, or different objects of legitimacy.

=== Interactive dignity ===
Legitimacy in conflict zones, where multiple authorities compete over authority and legitimacy, can rest on other sources. The theory of interactive dignity by Weigand shows that interactions are key for the construction of substantive legitimacy in such contexts. The aspect of an authority that most concerns people in the absence of other accountability mechanisms are its actions, particularly with regard to how authorities interact with them on a day-to-day basis. The value-based expectation people have with regard to such interactions is one of human dignity. People expect procedures to be fair and practices to be respectful, reflecting a serving rather than an extractive attitude. As long as authorities do not satisfy people&#x27;s more immediate expectation of interactive dignity, people support and consider alternative authorities to be more legitimate.

== Forms ==
=== Numinous legitimacy ===

In a theocracy, government legitimacy derives from the spiritual authority of a god or a goddess.
* In ancient Egypt (c. 3150 BC), the legitimacy of the dominion of a Pharaoh (god–king) was theologically established by a doctrine that posited the pharaoh as the Egyptian patron god Horus, son of Osiris.

=== Civil legitimacy ===

The political legitimacy of a civil government derives from agreement among the autonomous constituent institutions—legislative, judicial, executive—combined for the national common good. In the United States, this issue has surfaced around how voting is impacted by gerrymandering, the United States Electoral College&#x27;s ability to produce winners by minority rule and discouragement of voter turnout outside of swing states, and the repeal of part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. Another challenge to the political legitimacy offered by elections is whether or not marginalized groups such as women or those who are incarcerated are allowed to vote.

Civil legitimacy can be granted through different measures for accountability than voting, such as financial transparency and stake-holder accountability. In the international system another method for measuring civil legitimacy is through accountability to international human rights norms.

In an effort to determine what makes a government legitimate, the Center for Public Impact launched a project to hold a global conversation about legitimacy stating, inviting citizens, academics and governments to participate. The organization also publishes case studies that consider the theme of legitimacy as it applies to projects in a number of different countries and cities including Bristol, Lebanon and Canada.

=== &quot;Good&quot; governance vs &quot;bad&quot; governance ===
The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commission (OHCHR) established standards of what is considered &quot;good governance&quot; that include the key attributes transparency, responsibility, accountability, participation and responsiveness (to the needs of the people).

=== Input, output and throughput legitimacy ===
Assessing the political legitimacy of a government can be done by looking at three different aspects of which a government can derive legitimacy. Fritz Scharpf introduced two normative criteria, which are output legitimacy, i.e. the effectiveness of policy outcomes for people and input legitimacy, the responsiveness to citizen concerns as a result of participation by the people. A third normative criterion was added by Vivien Schmidt, who analyzes legitimacy also in terms of what she calls throughput, i.e. the governance processes that happen in between input and output.

=== Negative and positive legitimacy ===
Abulof distinguishes between negative political legitimacy (NPL), which is about the object of legitimation (answering &quot;what&quot; is legitimate), and positive political legitimacy (PPL), which is about the source of legitimation (answering &quot;who&quot; is the &#x27;legitimator&#x27;). NPL is concerned with establishing where to draw the line between good and bad; PPL with who should be drawing it in the first place. From the NPL perspective, political legitimacy emanates from appropriate actions; from a PPL perspective, it emanates from appropriate actors. In the social contract tradition, Hobbes and Locke focused on NPL (stressing security and liberty, respectively), while Rousseau focused more on PPL (&quot;the people&quot; as the legitimator). Arguably, political stability depends on both forms of legitimacy.

=== Instrumental and substantive legitimacy ===
Weber&#x27;s understanding of legitimacy rests on shared &quot;values&quot;, such as tradition and rational-legality. But policies that aim at (re-)constructing legitimacy by improving the service delivery or &#x27;output&#x27; of a state often only respond to shared &quot;needs&quot;. Therefore, Weigand distinguishes substantive sources of legitimacy from more instrumental ones. &quot;Instrumental legitimacy&quot; rests on &quot;the rational assessment of the usefulness of an authority ..., describing to what extent an authority responds to shared needs. Instrumental legitimacy is very much based on the perceived effectiveness of service delivery. Conversely, &quot;substantive legitimacy&quot; is a more abstract normative judgment, which is underpinned by shared values. If a person believes that an entity has the right to exercise social control, he or she may also accept personal disadvantages.&quot;

=== Perceived legitimacy ===
Establishing legitimacy is not simply transactional; service provision, elections and rule of law do not automatically grant legitimacy. State legitimacy rests on citizens&#x27; perceptions and expectations of the state, and these may be co-constructed between state actors and citizens. What legitimizes a state is also contextually specific. McCullough et al. (2020) show that in different countries, provision of different services build state legitimacy. In Nepal public water provision was most associated with state legitimacy, while in Pakistan it was health services. But it is not only states that can build legitimacy. Other authorities, such as armed groups in a conflict zones, may construct legitimacy more successfully than the state in certain strata of the population.

=== Foundational and contingent legitimacy ===
Political theorist Ross Mittiga has proposed an alternative typology, consisting of two parts: foundational and contingent legitimacy. According to Mittiga, foundational legitimacy (FL) &quot;pertains to a government&#x27;s ability to ensure the safety and security of its citizens,&quot; while contingent legitimacy (CL) obtains in situations in which governments &quot;exercise[] power in acceptable ways.&quot;

Mittiga specifies further that FL:...is bound up with a range of political capacities and actions including, among other things, being able to ensure continuous access to essential goods (particularly food, water, and shelter), prevent avoidable catastrophes, provide immediate and effective disaster relief, and combat invading forces or quell unjustified uprisings or rebellions. If a government cannot fulfill these basic security functions, it is not legitimate, if it is even a government at all. [p.3]On the other hand, Mittiga acknowledges that there is &quot;extensive debate&quot; about which factors are relevant to CL, but argues that, &quot;[a]mong the most commonly defended factors&quot; are &quot;the presence of democratic rights and processes, consent, guarantees of equal representation, provision of core public benefits, protection of basic individual rights and freedoms, social justice, and observance of fairness principles.&quot; [pp. 4–5] Mittiga specifies further that &quot;[m]ost contemporary theorists maintain that legitimacy [in the contingent sense] requires multiple of these factors—some of which are procedural and others substantive.&quot;

According to Mittiga, what makes certain aspects of legitimacy &quot;contingent&quot; (as opposed to &quot;foundational&quot;) is that they are affected by (1) &quot;the problem of pluralism&quot;—i.e., the idea that &quot;any firm agreement on&quot; which factor(s) matters (or matter most of all) &quot;will remain elusive or at least always open to contestation and renegotiation&quot;; (2) &quot;the problem of partial displacement,&quot; which holds that &quot;when new legitimation factors emerge,&quot; as they often have historically, &quot;earlier ones may not entirely disappear but only become less salient, at least for sizable portions of the citizenry&quot;; and (3) &quot;the problem of exceptional circumstances,&quot; which is &quot;the fact that even widely shared and seemingly stable CL factors are routinely relaxed or abandoned during emergencies, often without calling into question the basic legitimacy of the government.&quot;

Mittiga summarizes the difference between these two types or levels or types of legitimacy as follows:The factors associated with CL condition the use of political power by specifying, for instance, what can or cannot be done or sacrificed, how decisions should be made, and who counts (and for how much). The answers to these questions often appear to us as moral universals; yet, in practice, they are the products of long and contentious historical processes. FL, on the other hand, does not vary between societies, generations, or circumstances. Ensuring safety and security is always the &quot;primary&quot;—though, in good states, under reasonably favorable conditions, not the &quot;exclusive&quot;—end of political power.

Aristotle expresses something like this in insisting that the point of political society is to furnish the resources needed not just to live but to live &quot;well&quot;. Crudely put, FL is about living, CL about living well. And it is of course impossible to live well without living: after all, there can be no democracy of desolation, no fair social cooperation in conditions of extreme scarcity, no real rights when political stability is maintainable only through raw assertions of coercive power (if it can be maintained at all). In this sense, FL is &quot;necessarily&quot; prior to CL, and must be regarded as such in moments when trade-offs become a necessary part of the political calculus. [p.7]

== Sources ==
Max Weber proposed that societies behave cyclically in governing themselves with different types of governmental legitimacy. That democracy was unnecessary for establishing legitimacy, a condition that can be established with codified laws, customs, and cultural principles, not by means of popular suffrage. That a society might decide to revert from the legitimate government of a rational–legal authority to the charismatic government of a leader; e.g., the Nazi Germany of Adolf Hitler, Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini, and Francoist Spain under General Francisco Franco.
The French political scientist Mattei Dogan&#x27;s contemporary interpretation of Weber&#x27;s types of political legitimacy (traditional, charismatic, legal-rational) proposes that they are conceptually insufficient to comprehend the complex relationships that constitute a legitimate political system in the 21st century. Moreover, Dogan proposed that traditional authority and charismatic authority are obsolete as forms of contemporary government; e.g., the Islamic Republic of Iran (est. 1979) rule by means of the priestly Koranic interpretations by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. That traditional authority has disappeared in the Middle East; that the rule-proving exceptions are Islamic Iran and Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the third Weber type of political legitimacy, rational-legal authority, exists in so many permutations no longer allow it to be limited as a type of legitimate authority.

== Forms of legitimate government ==
In determining the political legitimacy of a system of rule and government, the term proper—&quot;political legitimacy&quot;—is philosophically an essentially contested concept that facilitates understanding the different applications and interpretations of abstract, qualitative, and evaluative concepts such as &quot;art&quot;, &quot;social justice&quot;, et cetera, as applied in aesthetics, political philosophy, the philosophy of history, and the philosophy of religion. Therefore, in defining the political legitimacy of a system of government and rule, the term &quot;essentially contested concept&quot; indicates that a key term (communism, democracy, constitutionalism, etc.) has different meanings within a given political argument. Hence, the intellectually restrictive politics of dogmatism (&quot;My answer is right, and all others are wrong&quot;), scepticism (&quot;I don&#x27;t know what is true, and I even doubt my own opinion&quot;), and eclecticism (&quot;Each meaning gives a partial view, so the more meanings the better&quot;) are inappropriate philosophic stances for managing a political term that has more than one meaning (see Walter Bryce Gallie).

Establishing what qualifies as a legitimate form of government continues to be a topic of great philosophical controversy. Forms of legitimate government are posited to include:
* Communism, where the legitimacy of a Communist state derives from having won a civil war, a revolution, or from having won an election such as the Presidency of Salvador Allende (1970–73) in Chile; thus, the actions of the Communist government are legitimate, authorised by the people. In the early 20th century, Communist parties based the arguments supporting the legitimacy of their rule and government upon the claimed scientific nature of Marxism (see dialectical materialism).
* Constitutionalism, where the modern political concept of constitutionalism establishes the law as supreme over the private will, by integrating nationalism, democracy, and limited government. The political legitimacy of constitutionalism derives from popular belief and acceptance that the actions of the government are legitimate because they abide by the law codified in the political constitution. The political scientist Carl Joachim Friedrich (1901–1984) said that, in dividing political power among the organs of government, constitutional law effectively restrains the actions of the government (see checks and balances).
* Democracy, where government legitimacy derives from the popular perception that the elected government abides by democratic principles in governing, and thus is legally accountable to its people.
* Fascism, where in the 1920s and the 1930s it based its political legitimacy upon the arguments of traditional authority; respectively, the German National Socialists and the Italian Fascists claimed that the political legitimacy of their right to rule derived from philosophically denying the (popular) political legitimacy of elected liberal democratic governments. During the Weimar Republic (1918–1933), the political philosopher Carl Schmitt (1888–1985)—whose legal work as the &quot;Crown Jurist of the Third Reich&quot; promoted fascism and deconstructed liberal democracy—addressed the matter in &quot;Legalität und Legitimität&quot; (Legality and Legitimacy, 1932), an anti-democratic polemic treatise that asked: &quot;How can parliamentary government make for law and legality, when a 49 per cent minority accepts as politically legitimate the political will of a 51 per cent majority?&quot;
* Monarchy, where the divine right of kings establishes the political legitimacy of the rule of the monarch (king or queen); legitimacy also derives from the popular perception (tradition and custom) and acceptance of the monarch as the rightful ruler of nation and country. Contemporarily, such divine-right legitimacy is manifest in the absolute monarchy of the House of Saud (est. 1744), a royal family who have ruled and governed Saudi Arabia since the 18th century. Moreover, constitutional monarchy is a variant form of monarchic political legitimacy which combines traditional authority and legal–rational authority, by which means the monarch maintains nationalist unity (one people) and democratic administration (a political constitution).
* Theocracy, where deity establishes legitimacy.

<text>The General Electric GAU-8/A Avenger is a 30 mm hydraulically driven seven-barrel Gatling-style autocannon that is primarily mounted in the United States Air Force&#x27;s Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. Designed to destroy a wide variety of ground targets, the Avenger delivers 30mm rounds at a high rate of fire. The GAU-8/A is also used in the Dutch Goalkeeper CIWS ship weapon system, which provides defense against short-range threats such as highly maneuverable missiles, aircraft, and fast-maneuvering surface vessels. The GAU-8/A was designed by General Electric and has been produced by General Dynamics since 1977.

==History==
The GAU-8 was created as a parallel program with the &quot;A-X&quot; (or Attack Experimental) competition that produced the A-10. The specification for the cannon was laid out in 1970, with General Electric and Philco-Ford offering competing designs. Both of the A-X prototypes, the YA-10 and the Northrop YA-9, were designed to incorporate the weapon, although it was not available during the initial competition; the M61 Vulcan was used as a temporary replacement. Once completed, the entire GAU-8 assembly (correctly referred to as the A/A 49E-6 Gun System) represents about 16% of the A-10 aircraft&#x27;s unladen weight. Because the gun plays a significant role in maintaining the A-10&#x27;s balance and center of gravity, a jack must be installed beneath the airplane&#x27;s tail whenever the gun is removed for inspection in order to prevent the aircraft from tipping rearwards.
The gun is mounted slightly to the port side with the active firing cannon barrel on the starboard side at the 9 o&#x27;clock position and on the aircraft&#x27;s center line. The front landing gear is positioned to the starboard side. The gun is loaded using Syn-Tech&#x27;s linked tube carrier GFU-8/E 30 mm Ammunition Loading Assembly cart. 

The A-10 with its GAU-8/A gun entered service in 1977. It was produced by General Electric, though General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products has been responsible for production and support since 1997 when the division was sold by Lockheed Martin to General Dynamics.

In November 1988, the US Air Force sought to pursue the idea of a dedicated CAS F-16 using the GAU-8 Avenger cannon from the A-10. The 174th Tactical Fighter Wing was transitioned off of the A-10A to the F-16A/B Block 10, and during Desert Storm their aircraft were equipped with the GPU-5/A Pave Claw pod housing the 30mm GAU-13/A, which was a four-barrel variant of the seven-barrel GAU-8 Avenger used by the A-10. These aircraft were redesignated F/A-16 and were the only F-16s equipped with this type of weapon. However, the F-16s suffered from poor accuracy (due to the less rigid pylon mounting and stronger vibrations when firing), lack of CCIP software, and faster flight speeds giving pilots less time to aim. The gun was found to be ineffective against point targets, and less effective than cluster munitions for area targets, leading the Air Force to quickly abandon the plan.

==Design==
The GAU-8 itself weighs , but the complete weapon, with feed system and drum, weighs with a maximum ammunition load. It measures from the muzzle to the rearmost point of the ammunition system, and the ammunition drum alone is in diameter and long. Power for operating the gun is provided by twin hydraulic motors pressurized from two independent hydraulic systems. The magazine can hold 1,174 rounds, although 1,150 is the typical load-out. Muzzle velocity when firing armor-piercing incendiary rounds is 1,013 m/s, almost the same as the substantially lighter M61 Vulcan&#x27;s 20 mm round, giving the gun a muzzle energy of just over 200 kilojoules.
The standard ammunition mixture for anti-armor use is a five-to-one mix of PGU-14/B Armor Piercing Incendiary, with a projectile weight of about 14.0 oz (395 grams or 6,096 grains) and PGU-13/B High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) rounds, with a projectile weight of about 13.3 oz (378 grams or 5,833 grains). The PGU-14/B&#x27;s projectile incorporates a lightweight aluminum body, cast around a smaller caliber depleted uranium penetrating core. In 1979, the Avenger was tested against M47 Patton tanks and caused &quot;severe damage&quot;.

An innovation in the design of the GAU-8/A ammunition is the use of aluminum alloy cases in place of the traditional steel or brass. This alone adds 30% to ammunition capacity for a given weight. The projectiles incorporate a plastic driving band to improve barrel life. The cartridges measure in length and weigh or more.
The Avenger&#x27;s rate of fire was originally selectable, 2,100 rounds per minute (rpm) in the low setting, or 4,200 rpm in the high setting. This rate was later changed to a fixed rate of 3,900 rpm. At this speed it would take 18 seconds of sustained fire to empty the magazine. In practice, the cannon is limited to one and two-second bursts to avoid overheating and conserve ammunition; barrel life is also a factor, since the USAF has specified a minimum life of at least 20,000 rounds for each set of barrels. There is no technical limitation on the duration the gun may be continuously fired, and a pilot could potentially expend the entire ammunition load in a single burst with no damage or ill effects to the weapons system itself. However, this constant rate of fire would shorten the barrel life considerably and require added barrel inspections and result in shorter intervals between replacement.

Each barrel is a very simple non-automatic design having its own breech and bolt. Like the original Gatling gun, the entire firing cycle is actuated by cams and powered by the rotation of the barrels. The seven-barrel carriage assembly itself is driven by the aircraft&#x27;s dual hydraulic system.

The GAU-8/A ammunition feed is linkless, reducing weight and avoiding a great deal of potential for jamming. The feed system is double-ended, allowing the spent casings to be returned to the ammunition drum. Additionally, returning empty cases to the drum has less effect on the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity than ejecting them. The feed system is based on that developed for later M61 installations, but uses more advanced design techniques and materials throughout, to save weight.

===Firing system===
====Accuracy====
The GAU-8/A is extremely accurate and can fire up to 3,900 rounds per minute without complications. The 30-mm shell has twice the range, half the time to target, and three times the mass of projectiles fired by guns mounted in comparable close air support aircraft.

While the GAU-8/A has a muzzle velocity that is comparable to that of the M61 Vulcan, it uses heavier ammunition and has superior ballistics. The time of flight of its projectile to is 30 percent less than that of an M61 round; the GAU-8/A projectile decelerates much less after leaving the barrel, and it drops a negligible amount, about over the distance. The GAU-8/A precision when installed in the A-10 is rated at &quot;5 mil, 80 percent&quot;, meaning that 80 percent of rounds fired will hit within a cone with an angle of five milliradians; this equates to a diameter circle at the weapon&#x27;s design range of . By comparison, the M61 has an 8-milliradian dispersion.

====Recoil====
Because the gun&#x27;s recoil forces could push the entire plane off target during firing, the weapon is mounted laterally off-center, slightly to the port side of the fuselage centerline, with the active firing barrel lying directly on the aircraft&#x27;s centerline. The firing barrel also lies just below the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity, being bore-sighted along a line 2 degrees below the aircraft&#x27;s line of flight. This arrangement accurately centers the recoil forces, preventing changes in aircraft pitch or yaw when fired. This configuration also leaves space for the front landing gear, which is mounted slightly off-center on the starboard side of the nose.

The GAU-8/A utilizes recoil adapters. They are the interface between the gun housing and the gun mount. By absorbing (in compression) the recoil forces, they spread the time of the recoil impulse and counter recoil energy transmitted to the supporting structure when the gun is fired.
The A-10 engines were initially susceptible to flameout when subjected to gases generated in the firing of the gun. When the GAU-8 is being fired, the smoke from the gun can make the engines stop, and this did occur during initial flight testing. Gun exhaust is essentially oxygen-free, and is capable of causing flameouts of gas turbines. The A-10 engines now have a self-sustaining combustion section. When the gun is fired, the igniters come on to reduce the possibility of a flameout.

The average recoil force of the GAU-8/A is 10,000 pounds-force (45 kN), which is slightly more than the output of each of the A-10&#x27;s two TF34 engines of 9,065 lbf (40.3 kN). While this recoil force is significant, in practice a cannon-fire burst slows the aircraft by only a few miles per hour in level flight.

==Variants==
Some of the GAU-8/A technology has been transferred into the smaller 25 mm GAU-12/U Equalizer, which was developed for the AV-8B Harrier II aircraft. The GAU-12 is about the same size as the 20 mm M61. GE has also developed the GAU-13/A, a four-barreled weapon using GAU-8/A components, which has been tested in podded form as the GPU-5/A. The Avenger also forms the basis for the Dutch-developed Goalkeeper CIWS naval air-defense gun. No current or contemplated aircraft other than the A-10 carries the full-up Avenger system.

<text>Johann Peter Friedrich Ancillon (30 April 1767 – 19 April 1837) was a Prussian historian and statesman. He provided Frederick William III of Prussia with strong ideological support against political reforms that might restrain monarchical power.

He was appointed extraordinary member of the Philosophy Class at the Prussian Academy in 1803. He tutored the Crown Price who became Frederick William IV of Prussia. 1813 till 1837 Ancillon worked as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Prussia, and he tended to support Klemens von Metternich.

==Early life==
Ancillon was born in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia, and was the great-grandson of French jurist and diplomat Charles Ancillon. After studying theology at Geneva University, he was appointed minister to the French community in Berlin.

== Career ==
At the same time, his reputation as a historical scholar secured him the post of professor of history at the military academy. In 1793, he visited Switzerland, and in 1796 France, publishing the impressions gathered during his travels in a series of articles which he afterwards collected under the title of &quot;Mélanges de littérature et de philosophie&quot; (1801).

Ancillon took rank among the most famous historians of his day by his next work, &quot;Tableau des révolutions du système politique de l&#x27;Europe depuis le XVe siècle&quot; (1803, 4 volumes), which gained him the praise of the Institute of France, and admission to the Military Academy of Berlin. It was the first attempt to recognize psychological factors in historical movements, but otherwise its importance was exaggerated. Its &quot;sugary optimism, unctuous phraseology and pulpit logic&quot; appealed, however, to the reviving pietism of the age succeeding the Revolution, and these qualities, as well as his eloquence as a preacher, brought Ancillon to the notice of the court. In 1808 he was appointed tutor to the royal princes, in 1809 councillor of state in the department of religion, and in 1810 tutor of the crown prince (afterwards Frederick William IV of Prussia), on whose sensitive and dreamy nature he was to exercise a powerful but far from wholesome influence.

In October 1814, when his pupil came of age, Ancillon was included by Karl August von Hardenberg in the ministry, as privy councillor of legation in the department of foreign affairs, with a view to utilizing his supposed gifts as a philosophical historian in the preparation of the projected Prussian constitution. But Ancillon&#x27;s reputed liberalism was of too invertebrate a type to survive the trial of actual contact with affairs. The practical difficulty of the constitutional problem gave the &quot;court parson&quot;, as August von Gneisenau had contemptuously called him, excuse enough for a change of front which, incidentally, would please his exalted patrons. He covered his defection from Hardenberg&#x27;s liberal constitutionalism by a series of &quot;philosophical&quot; treatises on the nature of the state and of man, and became the soul of the reactionary movement at the Berlin court, and the faithful henchman of Klemens von Metternich in the general politics of Germany and of Europe.

In 1817 Ancillon became a councillor of state, and in 1818 director of the political section of the ministry for foreign affairs under Count Bernstorff. In his chief&#x27;s most important work, the establishment of the Prussian Zollverein, Ancillon had no share, while the entirely subordinate role played by Prussia in Europe during this period, together with the personal part taken by the sovereign in the various congresses, gave him little scope for the display of any diplomatic talents he may have possessed. During this time he found plentiful leisure to write a series of works on political philosophy, such as the &quot;Nouveaux essais de politique et de philosophie&quot; published in Paris 1824.

In 1828 Ancillon published in Berlin &quot;Zur Vermittlung der Extreme in den Meinungen&quot; and passed judgement on the English constitution. His contemporary Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann was a German liberal and reckoned that all &quot;new European states&quot; should aspire to the English constitution. Ancillon was a German conservative and published a more balanced opinion. He regarded the English constitution as a historic document and wrote &quot;the power of England, as well as the perfection of commerce and of the mechanism of productive work in this country&#x27; by other elements as the English constitution like in particular the strong importance of self-government and the weak presence of state officials.&quot;

In May 1831 Ancillon was made an active privy councillor, was appointed chief of the department for the principality of Neuchâtel, in July became secretary of state for foreign affairs, and in the spring of 1832, on Bernstorff&#x27;s retirement, succeeded him as head of the ministry.

By the German public, to whom Ancillon was known only through his earlier writings and some isolated protests against the &quot;demagogue-hunting&quot; in fashion at Berlin, his advent to power was hailed as a triumph of liberalism. They were soon undeceived. Ancillon had convinced himself that the rigid social class distinctions of the Prussian system were the philosophically ideal basis of the state, and that representation &quot;by estates&quot; was the only sound constitutional principle.

His last and indeed only act of importance as minister was his collaboration with Klemens von Metternich in the Vienna Final Act of 12 June 1834, the object of which was to rivet this system upon Germany forever. When he died, he was the last of his family. His historical importance lies neither in his writings nor in his political activity, but in his personal influence at the Prussian court, and especially in its lasting effect on the character of Frederick William IV.

== Philosophy ==

The political philosophy of Ancillon moves in an area of tension between the Enlightenment, Romanticism and Christianity. Ancillon&#x27;s philosophy, using an eclectic method, is based primarily on Edmund Burke and Charles de Montesquieu. Ancillon&#x27;s political and philosophical development was significantly influenced by his experience of the French Revolution as an eyewitness. Ancillon&#x27;s goal is always the harmony of domestic and foreign policy, the avoidance of conflicts, and the organic development of the state and society.

Without developing a complete and systematic political philosophy, Ancillon starts from basic Enlightenment assumptions such as the perfectibility of humans and the comprehensive influence of understanding and reason on human actions. At the same time, however, only that society is desirable which is not constructed solely according to rational principles, but has grown organically over the course of history and the succession of generations. Ancillon therefore rejects both the radical Enlightenment, which he holds responsible for the French Revolution, and mere romanticism, which he denies the ability of a practical state construction that opens up developmental opportunities for people. The aim of Ancillon&#x27;s political philosophy is the synthesis of Enlightenment and Romanticism under conservative auspices, namely in a corporate state that satisfies the demands of reason.

<doc id="574840" wikidata="Q3784914" url="?curid=574840" title="Henry Lee (forensic scientist)">
<text>Henry Chang-Yu Lee (; born 22 November 1938) is a Taiwanese and American forensic scientist and biochemist.

==Early life and education==
The 11th of 13 children, Lee was born in Rugao, then a county in the Chinese province of Jiangsu. He relocated to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War. His father, who was traveling separately from the rest of the family, diasappeared when the passenger ship &quot;Taiping&quot; sank. Lee graduated in 1960 from the Central Police College with a B.A. degree in police administration. He worked with the Taipei Police Department, where he rose to the rank of captain at age 22, the youngest in Taiwanese history.

Lee relocated to the United States with his wife in 1965. In 1972, he earned a B.S. in forensic science from John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City. He went on to study science and biochemistry at New York University and earned his M.S. in 1974 and Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1975.

==Career==
Lee was chief emeritus for the Connecticut State Police during 2000 to 2010, commissioner of Public Safety for Connecticut during 1998 to 2000, and Connecticut&#x27;s chief criminalist and director of the state police forensic laboratory from 1978 to 2000.

In 2004, a crime documentary series hosted by Lee, &quot;Trace Evidence: The Case Files of Dr. Henry Lee,&quot; aired on the then Court TV network (now truTV). He has appeared on Chinese television and online programs such as &quot;KangXi Lai Le&quot; in Taiwan, and &quot;Voice&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Edge&quot; in China Central Television on mainland China.

His biography, &quot;True Crime Experiences with Dr. Henry Chang-Yu Lee&quot; was authored by attorney Daniel Hong Deng of Rosemead, California.

He is the founder of the Henry C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science, affiliated with the University of New Haven.

===Famous cases===
He has worked on famous cases such as the JonBenét Ramsey murder case, the Helle Crafts wood chipper murder (the first murder conviction in Connecticut without the victim&#x27;s body,) the O. J. Simpson and Laci Peterson cases, the 9/11 forensic investigation, the Washington, DC sniper shootings and reinvestigated the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Lee investigated the March 19, 2004 shooting incident of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.

Following the O. J. Simpson case, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr hired Lee to join his investigation of the death of Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993.

He also was consulted on the 1991 death of investigative journalist Danny Casolaro, who died in a West Virginia motel room. Initially, Lee said the evidence presented to him by police was consistent with suicide. A few years later when additional evidence from the hotel scene was revealed to him, Lee formally withdrew his earlier conclusion and stated, &quot;a reconstruction is only as good as the information supplied by the police.”

Lee was consulted as a blood spatter analyst for defense during the trial of Michael Peterson, a fiction writer and politician from North Carolina who in 2003 was convicted of the murder of his wife, Kathleen Peterson.

In 2007, Lee testified as a prosecution expert witness at the first trial of Cal Harris, an upstate New York car dealer accused of killing his wife on the night of September 11, 2001. Since no body has ever been found, the state&#x27;s best evidence of foul play was some medium-velocity castoff impact blood spatter on the walls of the house&#x27;s garage and kitchen. Lee told the jury that it could only have come from someone lower than above ground. Harris was convicted at that trial, and a retrial after new evidence emerged, but ultimately acquitted at a fourth trial after his conviction was overturned on appeal.

In 2008, Lee was involved in the early stages of investigation in Orlando, Florida for the missing toddler Caylee Anthony.

====Phil Spector trial====
In May 2007, Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler, the judge in the Phil Spector murder trial, said that he had concluded &quot;Lee hid or destroyed&quot; a piece of evidence from the scene of actress Lana Clarkson&#x27;s shooting. Lee denied the allegation, and &quot;when he testified before Fidler, Lee said he was astonished and insulted by claims by two former members of Spector&#x27;s defense team that he had collected a small white object that was never turned over to prosecutors, as the law requires.&quot; University of Southern California law professor Jean Rosenbluth said that Judge Fidler&#x27;s ruling was &quot;very narrow&quot; and noted that the judge had made no finding that Lee had lied on the stand or acted maliciously.

====Allegations of error====
In June 2019, the Connecticut Supreme Court concluded that Lee had erred in the murder trial testimony of (then) teenagers Shawn Henning and Ralph Birch; Lee said a towel tested positive for blood, but he had not tested it all. Later tests found no blood. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; questioned additional cases in which Lee had testified. At a June 17 press conference, Lee said that he had tested the towel, adding that chemical screening tests for blood had been done at the crime scene on the date of the homicide.

In July 2023, a federal court found that Lee had fabricated evidence in the Henning-Birch trial. Lee could be held liable in forthcoming civil suits. Henning and Birch spent 30 years in prison before being cleared of the crime.

==Personal life==
Lee holds dual Taiwanese and US citizenship. Lee resides in Connecticut, where he lived with his wife Margaret Lee, whom he married in 1962, until her death on August 1, 2017. His wife worked as a teacher and then a researcher for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Haven, Connecticut.

Lee remarried on December 1, 2018 to Xiaping Jiang, CEO of Jiadi (Hong Kong) Co., Yangzhou Jiadi Clothing Co., Ltd, and Yangzhou Jiadi Senior Care Center.

<text>Viper in the Fist (French &quot;Vipère au Poing&quot;) is a novel by Hervé Bazin. 

It is the first and best known of a trilogy, the rest being &quot;La Mort du Petit Cheval&quot; and &quot;Le Cri de la Chouette&quot;. These three novels are largely autobiographical.

When published in 1948, &quot;Vipère au Poing&quot; was an immense success and also the cause of a considerable scandal. It is nowadays considered a classic novel in France, read by students in high school.

==Synopsis==
Young Jean lives with his grandparents. When his grandmother dies, his parents come back from China (French Indochina in the 2004 film adaptation) where his father (Jacques) teaches law. He and his brothers then discover that their mother Paule is a horrible woman, who hates her life and her children. She is extremely severe with them, deliberately unfair to the point of cruelty. Their father is a weak man who, except on rare occasions, submits to his wife&#x27;s will. He spends his time in entomology studies.

Gradually, the situation turns to a perverse domestic war. Paule seizes any pretext for being cruel to her sons, and especially to Jean. Jean and his brother attempt to kill their mother twice: once with an overdose of medicine (which only gave her diarrhea); once by attempting to drown her in the river, making it seem an accident. She escapes.

On one occasion, she asks her sons&#x27; personal educator to flog Jean as a punishment. Jean escapes and goes to see his grandfather, a senator living in an upscale area of Paris. He is brought back by his father, who is fairly embarrassed by the situation.

Jean is now 15. He discovers sex with Madeleine, a young farmer&#x27;s daughter from the area. He does not love her, for he distrusts all women, in whom he sees his own mother. He claims women are little but a receptacle for semen.

Paule tries to have her son caught red-handed for theft by intentionally leaving her wallet in Jean&#x27;s bedroom. Jean foils her plot and after a short confrontation, he obtains what he wants, and what Paule wants too: the departure of Jean and his brother to a boarding school.

Jean concludes his memoirs by saying that while it seems that he has won, in reality Paule has destroyed his whole being. Throughout his life, he&#x27;ll not be able to feel trust or love.

==Social criticism==

&quot;Viper in the Fist&quot;, while short, is a vitriolic indictment of early 20th century French rural bourgeois society. Bazin&#x27;s hatred for this social milieu is obvious. He depicts a family where hypocrisy is rampant and where observance of Catholic rituals is far more important than virtues like love or compassion. While most portraits of common people seem good-hearted, depictions of the bourgeoisie and the ecclesiastical world are generally despicable. The various priests as educators collaborate with the narrator&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cruel follies and betray their lack of virtue with venal acts such as fornication with young women.

The universe that Bazin depicts — rural bourgeois rentiers — is slowly dying, but the characters do not seem to recognize this. They consider themselves the salt of the earth, replacing the former nobility, who failed in keeping France on a path they consider worthy. Like the nobility, they despise commerce. They have lofty opinions of themselves, yet their lives are mostly ruined. They cease to support the monarchist &quot;Action Française&quot; only because the Pope requested it, not because they themselves judged that it was repugnant.

==Movie adaptation==
A television film adaptation in 1971: &quot;Vipère au poing&quot;, directed by :Pierre Cardinal. 

A film adaptation of &quot;Viper in the Fist&quot;, titled &quot;Viper in the Fist&quot; (Vipère au Poing in French), was released in 2004. The movie was directed by :Philippe de Broca, and starred :Jules Sitruk as Jean Rezeau &quot;Brasse-Bouillon&quot;, :Jacques Villeret as Jacques Rezeau, and :Catherine Frot as Paule Rezeau.

<text>The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment), once known as the Royal Regiment of Foot, was the oldest and most senior infantry regiment of the line of the British Army, having been raised in 1633 during the reign of Charles I. The regiment existed continuously until 2006, when it amalgamated with the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers to become the Royal Scots Borderers, which merged with the Royal Highland Fusiliers (Princess Margaret&#x27;s Own Glasgow and Ayrshire Regiment), the Black Watch, the Highlanders (Seaforth, Gordons and Camerons) and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

==History==

===17th century===

In April 1633, Sir John Hepburn was granted a warrant by Charles I to recruit 1200 Scots for service with the French army in the 1618–1648 Thirty Years War. The nucleus came from Hepburn&#x27;s previous regiment, which fought with the Swedes from 1625 until August 1632, when Hepburn quarrelled with Gustavus Adolphus. It absorbed other Scottish units in the Swedish army, as well as those already with the French and by 1635 totalled around 8,000 men.

Sir John was killed in 1636 and succeeded as Colonel by his brother George, then, after his death in 1637, Lord James Douglas; following the custom of the time, the unit became known as the Régiment de Douglas. James died in a skirmish near Douai in 1645 and was replaced by his elder brother Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus, who remained in Scotland and had little contact with the regiment, other than supplying recruits. In 1653, he assigned the Colonelcy to his younger half-brother, George Douglas, later Earl of Dumbarton. 

In 1660, Charles II was restored as king; in January 1661, Douglas&#x27;s was sent to England in response to Venner&#x27;s Rising, an attempted coup by Fifth Monarchists. The revolt was quickly crushed and it returned to France, since the recently elected Cavalier Parliament quickly disbanded the New Model Army but refused to fund replacements. It remained in France until 1679, apart from a period during the 1664-67 Second Anglo-Dutch War when it was based at the naval dockyard of Chatham. The diarist Pepys met George Douglas in Rochester and recorded that &quot;Here in the streets, I did hear the Scotch march beat by the drums before the soldiers, which is very odde.&quot; In 1667, the regiment was accused of looting after the Raid on the Medway and ordered back to France; while awaiting transport, over 700 of the 1,500 men deserted.

During the 1672-74 Third Anglo-Dutch War, Douglas&#x27;s was part of the British Brigade that fought with the French, commanded by the Duke of Monmouth. It served in the Rhineland throughout the Franco-Dutch War, even after the Anglo-Dutch war ended in February 1674; it became the Régiment de Dumbarton in 1675, after George Douglas was made Earl of Dumbarton. The 1678 Treaties of Nijmegen required the repatriation of all Scots and English units from France; reluctant to lose veteran troops, this was made as hard as possible. Dumbarton&#x27;s was posted to the Dauphiné in Southern France before being disbanded and its men prevented from travelling for 30 days thereafter; many chose to remain, while those who arrived in England did so without money or possessions.

The regiment was listed on the English military establishment as the First Foot or Royal Scots, a temporary measure during the Exclusion Crisis of 1679–1681. Four of its twenty-one companies joined the Tangier Garrison in April 1680, with another twelve in September. It was awarded a battle honour for &#x27;Tangier&#x27; in 1908, but the colony and its garrison was evacuated in 1684. A war diary for 1680 was kept by its commander, Sir James Halkett, allegedly one of the first examples to survive.

On its return, the unit was renamed His Majesty&#x27;s Royal Regiment of Foot in June 1684. When James II succeeded Charles in 1685, the regiment fought at the decisive Battle of Sedgemoor that ended the June Monmouth Rebellion; a second battalion was raised in March 1686 and posted to Scotland.

It was the only unit where the majority remained loyal to James during the November 1688 Glorious Revolution; Dumbarton followed him into exile and one of William&#x27;s subordinates, Frederick Schomberg, was appointed Colonel. While awaiting transport from Ipswich to Flanders, it mutinied on 15 March 1689, a combination of not being paid and dislike at being commanded by a foreigner. However, the mutineers were treated with leniency and later agreed to the move.

At the start of the 1688–1697 Nine Years War, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Robert Douglas commanded the first battalion at the Battle of Walcourt in 1689. After Schomberg was killed in Ireland, he was promoted Colonel in July 1690. The second battalion arrived from Scotland in 1690 and both battalions fought at the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692, where Sir Robert was killed. They then fought at the Battle of Landen in 1693 and at the Siege of Namur. When the Treaty of Ryswick ended the war in 1697, it was transferred to Ireland.

===18th century===

During the War of the Spanish Succession, the regiment served under Marlborough at Schellenberg, Blenheim, Ramillies and Oudenarde. At Malplaquet in 1709, its members included William Hiseland, an 89-year-old reputed to be the last serving veteran of the First English Civil War.

Both battalions spent 1715 to 1742 in Ireland, but after this were normally separated. The 1st was based in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession, where it fought at Fontenoy in 1745. After returning from Puerto Bello in 1743, the 2nd helped suppress the Jacobite rising of 1745, before being posted to Ireland once again.

In the army reforms of 1751, the unit was ranked as the most senior infantry line regiment and titled the 1st (Royal) Regiment of Foot. On the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756, the 2nd Battalion moved to Nova Scotia in 1757, fighting at Louisburg, Guadeloupe and Havana, then returning home in 1764.

Until American War began in 1775, both served as garrisons in the Mediterranean, the 1st in Gibraltar, the 2nd in Minorca. Sent to the West Indies in 1781, the 1st Battalion helped capture St Eustatius; it surrendered at St. Kitts in January 1782 but was later exchanged.

===French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars===
The 1st Battalion had returned to the West Indies as a garrison in 1790, and served there until 1797, with a brief period of combat in the Haitian Revolution. The West Indies were hotbeds of disease, and the battalion lost more than half its strength to disease in this period. It was reformed from militia volunteers in Ireland in 1798: This year saw a major rebellion erupt in Ireland after years of simmering tension. The Lothian Fencibles fought with distinction at the Battle of Vinegar Hill, one of the more important engagements of the rebellion. Subsequently, the regiment gained a new regimental song:

:Ye croppies of Wexford, I&#x27;d have ye be wise
:and go not to meddle with Mid-Lothian Boys
:For the Mid-Lothian Boys they vow and declare
:They&#x27;ll crop off your head as well as your hair
:derry, down, down.
:Remember at Ross and at Vinegar Hill
:How your heads flew about like chaff in a mill
:For the Mid-Lothian Boys when a croppy they see
:they blow out his daylights and tip him cut three
:derry, down, down.
After the rebellion was over in Ireland they were used in minor raids on the coast of Spain in 1800. Meanwhile, from 1793 to 1801, the 2nd Battalion was based in the Mediterranean. It fought at the Siege of Toulon (1793) and the capture of Corsica (1794), returning briefly to Northern Europe for the Battle of Egmont op Zee in the 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, before fighting in the 1801 Egyptian campaign at the Battle of Aboukir and the Battle of Alexandria.

Both battalions were subsequently dispatched to the West Indies, the 1st from 1801 to 1812, and the 2nd from 1803 to 1806. The 1st occupied Saint Thomas in 1801, fought at the capture of Saint Lucia, as well as of Demerara and Essequibo in 1803, and the capture of Guadeloupe in 1810. The 2nd then moved to India, where it would remain until 1826, whilst the 1st was sent to Quebec with the outbreak of the War of 1812. It fought in the battles of Sackett&#x27;s Harbor and Buffalo &amp; Black Rock, as well as the capture of Fort Niagara (1813), the battles of Longwoods, Chippawa, and Lundy&#x27;s Lane, along with the Siege of Fort Erie and the Battle of Cook&#x27;s Mills (1814). In February 1812, the regiment was retitled as the 1st Regiment of Foot (Royal Scots), the first official appearance of the popular name.
Two new battalions were raised in late 1804, at Hamilton, the 3rd and 4th Battalions. The 3rd served in the Peninsular War from 1808 to 1809, fighting at the Battle of Corunna in 1809 before being withdrawn by sea and sent to the Walcheren Campaign with the 1st Division. It returned to Portugal in 1810 with the 5th Division, fighting at the Battle of Buçaco (1810), the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro (1811), the battles of Badajoz, Salamanca and Burgos (1812), the Battle of Vitoria, capture of San Sebastián, Battle of Nivelle, and the Battle of Nive (1813), before advancing into France in 1814. It was sent to Belgium during the Hundred Days, and fought in Picton&#x27;s Division (the 5th) at the Battle of Waterloo (1815). After two years in the Army of Occupation, it was disbanded at Canterbury in 1817.

The 4th was deployed to the Baltic in 1813, being involved with the recapture of Stralsund, and fought in the Netherlands in 1814, where it was captured and exchanged. It was then dispatched to Canada as part of the War of 1812, where it served as a garrison. It was withdrawn to England with the end of the fighting and disbanded at Dover in 1816.

===19th century===

The 1st battalion was sent to Ireland after the end of the Napoleonic wars, and stationed there from 1816 until 1825, when it was moved to the West Indies, where it remained until 1835. The 2nd battalion, however, had a more active time; based in India, it was involved in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, where it fought at the Battle of Nagpore (1817) and Battle of Mahidpur (1818), and in the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824–26. It moved to Scotland in 1830, and to Canada in 1836, where it was involved in the Rebellions of 1837. The regiment fought at the Battle of Saint-Denis (1837), but was running low on ammunition as the British officers had underestimated the amount of insurgents, and with the enemy beginning to flank, Colonel Charles Gore gave the order to withdraw. A move to the West Indies in 1843 was complicated by half the regiment being shipwrecked and delayed several months, but was successful, and the regiment finally returned to Scotland in 1846.

Both battalions saw active service in the Crimean War, with the 1st fighting at the battles of Alma and Inkerman (1854), and both fighting in the Siege of Sevastopol (1854–55), where the regiment&#x27;s first VC was won. After the war, the 1st battalion moved to Ceylon in 1857 and thence to India, returning home in 1870, whilst the 2nd battalion moved to Hong Kong, and saw action in the Second Opium War, fighting at the capture of the Taku Forts (1858) and Pekin (1860), and returning home in 1861.

In 1881, following comprehensive reforms following the Crimean war (Cardwell Reforms of 1870), the ambitious Childers Reforms were passed by the War Office. Among many changes was the merger of the many numbered regiments of foot into un-numbered &#x27;county regiments&#x27;. Because the regiment already had two battalions, it fared much better than the many other regiments which lost their identities and merged into new two-battalion regiments. Under the February 1881 proposals, the regiment was due to be redesignated as The Lothian Regiment (Royal Scots), however under the final July reform, the regiment became The Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment). Under the previously mentioned reforms, the regiment became a county regiment, encompassing the following: City of Edinburgh (Midlothian), Haddingtonshire (East Lothian), Linlithgowshire (West Lothian), and Berwickshire (later transferred to the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers on 1 May 1887). In addition to the two regular battalions and depot, the regiment now took control of the various militia and infantry (rifle) volunteers based in the above counties. This left the regiment with the following structure:

* Regimental Headquarters, at Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh
* Regimental Depot (part of the 1st Regimental District), at Glencorse Barracks, Glencorse
* 1st Battalion – &quot;regular, previously 1st Battalion, 1st (Royal Scots) Regiment of Foot&quot;
* 2nd Battalion – &quot;regular, previously 2nd Battalion, 1st (Royal Scots) Regiment of Foot&quot;
* 3rd Battalion (The Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Regiment of Light Infantry) – &quot;Militia&quot;
* 1st Edinburgh (City) Rifle Volunteers (The Queen&#x27;s City of Edinburgh Rifle Volunteer Brigade) – &quot;three battalions forming the main Rifle Volunteers element – forming the 1st volunteer battalion of the regiment&quot;
* 2nd Edinburgh (City) Rifle Volunteer Corps – &quot;2nd volunteer battalion of the regiment&quot;
* 1st Midlothian (Leith) Rifle Volunteer Corps – &quot;3rd volunteer battalion of the regiment&quot;
* 2md Midlothian (Midlothian &amp; Peebles-shire) Rifle Volunteer Corps – &quot;4th volunteer battalion of the regiment&quot;
* 1st Linlithgowshire Rifle Volunteer Corps – &quot;5th volunteer battalion of the regiment&quot;
* 1st Haddington Rifle Volunteer Corps – &quot;6th volunteer battalion of the regiment&quot;

In 1881, the 1st was in the West Indies; it moved to South Africa in 1884, when it saw action in the Bechuanaland campaign, and remained there until 1891, when it moved back to the UK to serve as the depot battalion and the 2nd moved out to India. With the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Boer War, the 1st was quickly earmarked for service in South Africa, and sailed in late 1899. It remained there until 1903, being joined by the 3rd from 1900 to 1902 – the first time a non-regular unit of the regiment had been activated. The bulk of the time in South Africa was spent patrolling and in mobile columns, with neither battalion engaged in any major battles. The 2nd battalion was posted in India in 1891, and stayed there until 1909. The battalion had various postings around the sub-continent, including Poona until late 1902 when it moved to Kamptee.

In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and seven Territorial battalions. The 1st moved back to India in 1909, relieving the 2nd, which moved back to the UK; they remained stationed there until 1914.

===First World War (1914–1919)===
At the outbreak of the First World War, the 1st was in India, and returned to the UK in November; the 2nd was immediately deployed with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), arriving in France on 14 August and seeing action on the afternoon of the 23rd. The Special Reserve had been mobilised, with the 3rd Battalion activated at Weymouth, and all seven battalions of the Territorial Force had mobilised and raised an additional second-line battalion by the end of 1914. A further seven battalions of the New Army were formed in 1914, including two Pals battalions By the end of 1914, the regiment stood at a strength of 24 battalions; another six Territorial battalions and three New Army battalions (one of bantams) were formed in 1915. In 1916, one service and one reserve battalion were formed by merging depleted Territorial battalions, and in 1917 a labour battalion was formed. In total, the Royal Scots raised some thirty-five battalions of infantry and over 100,000 men during the course of the First World War, of which fifteen battalions saw active service. 11,000 soldiers serving in the regiment were killed, and over 40,000 wounded. Among other decorations and honours, the regiment won six Victoria Crosses.

The 1st, on returning from India, was placed in the 27th Division, a division made up of regular units that had been recalled from garrison duty, and arrived in France in December 1914. It saw combat in the action of Saint-Éloi and throughout the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, before the division was withdrawn and moved to Salonika in November, where it spent the rest of the war It was sent to Georgia in December 1918 for operations against the Bolsheviks, and returned to Edinburgh in May 1919. The 2nd was part of the 3rd Division, one of the first units of the British Expeditionary Force to be sent to France. It first saw action in the Battle of Mons, and thence at almost all of the major actions on the Western Front, before returning to Scotland in 1919.

The 1/4th (Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Rifles) and 1/7th mobilised in Edinburgh in August 1914, and were assigned to the 52nd (Lowland) Division. Whilst the division was mobilising, the 1/7th was involved in the Quintinshill rail crash, which killed 210 officers and men and wounded another 224. They fought at the Battle of Gallipoli before being moved to Egypt in 1916 and serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. They were sent to France in April 1918 for the Second Battle of the Somme, and remained there until the end of the war. Both battalions were reduced to a cadre in March 1919, and returned home to disband in May.

The 1/5th (Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh Rifles) mobilised in Edinburgh in August 1914, and were assigned to the 29th Division. A poignant Christmas card was produced by the Edinburgh artist Walter Balmer Hislop who served with &#x27;D&#x27; Company of the 5th (QER) Battalion . They fought at the Battle of Gallipoli, then to France via Egypt, and saw action on the first day on the Somme. The 1/6th had mobilised at the same time and been dispatched to Egypt in 1915 for the Western Frontier Force; it too was withdrawn to France for the Somme. The two heavily depleted battalions were amalgamated in July 1916, and spent the remainder of war on the Western Front as the 5/6th. After the war, it remained in Belgium until January 1919 when it moved into Germany, and was reduced to a cadre in October 1919 and sent home to be disbanded.

The 1/8th mobilised at Haddington in August 1914, and arrived in France in November – the first Scottish territorial unit to arrive in France – with the 7th Division, though they did not see action until the Battle of Neuve Chapelle. After the Second Battle of Ypres, in August 1915, they were transferred to the 51st (Highland) Division as the divisional pioneers, and disbanded in March 1919 at Haddington The 1/9th mobilised at Edinburgh in August 1914, and moved to France in February 1915 with the 27th Division; when this moved to Salonika in November they remained in France, transferring to the 5th Division, and then to Third Army reserve. They were assigned to the 51st (Highland) Division in March 1916, with whom they fought for two years, then to the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and 15th (Scottish) Division in 1918.
The 11th, 12th and 13th were raised in August 1914 in Edinburgh, with the 11th and 12th allocated to 9th (Scottish) Division and the 13th to 15th (Scottish) Division, and moved to France in mid-1915. They first saw action at the Battle of Loos, where the 11th was almost wiped out, and spent the remainder of the war on the Western Front. The 11th and 12th moved to Germany after the armistice; the 12th was reduced to a cadre in April 1919 and disbanded in the UK in June, whilst the 11th was reduced to a cadre and disbanded at Cologne in November. The 13th remained in Belgium, being reduced to a cadre in March 1919 and disbanded in the UK in June.

The 15th was raised in September 1914, the 16th (which came to be known as McCrae&#x27;s Battalion) in December 1914, and the 17th in February 1915, in Edinburgh. The 15th and 16th were assigned to the 34th Division and the 17th to the 35th Division, moved to France in early 1916, and first saw action at the first day on the Somme; all three spent the remainder of the war on the Western Front. The 15th and 16th were reduced to cadres in May 1918 and disbanded in August; the 17th was based in Belgium after the armistice, and provided internal security in France and Belgium in early 1919, before being reduced to a cadre in April and disbanded shortly afterward.

The 2/10th was originally mobilised as bicycle infantry, but never served in this role. It was the only second-line battalion of the regiment to be sent overseas, moving to Archangel in August 1918, and serving in the North Russia Campaign until June 1919, when it returned to Scotland to disband. The remaining battalions all remained in the UK on Home Service, and did not see active duty. However, six saw significant periods of service in Ireland, where they served as garrison units, and were often involved in local security – armed patrols, mobile columns to &#x27;show the flag&#x27;, and the like.

===Inter-war period (1919–1939)===
The regiment was reduced sharply in size following the Armistice; during 1919, the 3rd Battalion disbanded, as did all bar one of the Territorial battalions (the one exception being the 2/10th, which was finally disbanded in February 1920).

In September 1919, the 1st Battalion again embarked for imperial service, taking up garrison duties in Rangoon, and in August 1920 the 2nd Battalion was sent to Ireland for service in what would later become the Anglo-Irish War; they would remain there until January 1922.

When the Territorial Force was reconstituted as the Territorial Army in 1920, all seven Territorial battalions of the regiment were reconstituted. At the beginning of 1921, the regiment was formally retitled The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment), and comprised two regular battalions, one Supplementary Reserve battalion, and four battalions of the newly renamed Territorial Army, all four of which were activated during the 1921 coal strike. In January 1922, reductions in the military led to the amalgamation of the Territorial component into two battalions. The three battalions not retained in 1921 were converted to support units outside the regimental structure. The 4th/5th Battalion was later, in 1938, transferred to the Royal Engineers and converted into an anti-aircraft role, becoming the 4th/5th Battalion, The Royal Scots (The Royal Regiment) (52nd Searchlight Regiment). It was later transferred to the Royal Artillery in August 1940 as the 52nd (Queen&#x27;s Edinburgh, Royal Scots) Searchlight Regiment, Royal Artillery.

The 1st Battalion moved from Rangoon to Secunderabad in 1922, then to Aden in 1925. They finally returned to the UK in 1926, barracked at Maryhill in Glasgow, where they saw duty in the General Strike. Under the Cardwell system, it was common for one battalion to remain at home while the other one served overseas, and accordingly in January 1926 the 2nd Battalion moved to Egypt, then to China in 1928. In 1930, they moved to Quetta, then Lahore in 1934, and finally Hong Kong in January 1938. At the same time, the 1st Battalion was deployed to serve in the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine, where it would remain for a year, until January 1939, when it became part of the 4th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division. Some sources suggest the 1st Battalion was briefly reorganised as a machine-gun battalion during this period.

With the re-armament program in the late 1930s, the Territorial component of the regiment was heavily altered; one of the two battalions was converted into an anti-aircraft role in 1938 whilst the other formed a duplicate 8th Battalion on 2 August 1939.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===
At the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the 1st Battalion, Royal Scots was at Aldershot as part of 4th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 1st Border Regiment and 2nd Royal Norfolk Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division; accordingly, it deployed to France with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It moved to Lecelles in September, and in May 1940 moved into Belgium during the Battle of France. The BEF were heavily hit by the German Army&#x27;s breakthrough, however, and fell back towards the coast; the battalion was deployed at Le Paradis, near Béthune, on 25 May to protect the flanks of the Dunkirk evacuation. After being heavily hit by armoured attacks, the battalion ceased fighting on the afternoon of 27 May. The adjacent unit, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Norfolks, had almost one hundred men taken prisoner and later shot by their captors in the Le Paradis massacre. Recent research has suggested that around twenty Royal Scots suffered a similar fate. The remnants of the battalion were reconstituted in Bradford in June. After Dunkirk, the battalion spent nearly two years on home defence preparing for a potential German invasion of the United Kingdom. The 1st Royal Scots, along with the rest of the 2nd Division, was sent to British India in April 1942 to train for jungle warfare.

The two Territorial Army units, the 7th/9th, which was the 7th and 9th battalions merged, and 8th Battalions, mobilised in Scotland in September; the 7th/9th was briefly deployed to France with the 155th Infantry Brigade, alongside the 4th and 5th King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division before the collapse of the French government, but was quickly withdrawn. The regiment raised a fifth battalion in June 1940; it was created as the 50th (Holding) Battalion in June 1940 where it would &#x27;hold&#x27; men who were medically unfit, temporarily homeless or on a course etc. but redesignated the 12th Battalion in October 1940. Also raised were the 10th and 11th (Home Defence) battalions, raised in late 1939 specifically for defensive duties in the United Kingdom. Both battalions, like most others of the same type, would have consisted mainly of older and less fit men, with previous military experience, together with younger soldiers. The 11th, however, was disbanded in 1940 and, in 1941, the 10th dropped the &#x27;Home Defence&#x27; subtitle and was redesignated as the 30th Battalion but was disbanded in 1943.

Most of 1941 passed without active duty for the regiment, and with growing concerns about the stability of the Far East, the 2nd Battalion, still based at Hong Kong, moved into defensive positions around the colony. On 8 December, the Battle of Hong Kong began a few hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor; after bitter fighting, the garrison surrendered on Christmas Day. The newly formed 12th Battalion was disbanded and reformed as the 2nd Battalion in May 1942.

In April 1942 the 1st Battalion, Royal Scots was moved to Bombay, and then to Chittagong in December, still with 2nd Infantry Division. It fought in the Burma Campaign, first seeing action in the Arakan operations from March to May 1943, and then withdrawing into India. It later saw action at the Battle of Kohima in 1944 and the Battle of Mandalay in 1945. It was withdrawn to India to rest and refit in April 1945, and moved to Singapore in December.

The new 2nd Battalion was moved to Gibraltar in April 1943, and moved to Italy in July 1944, where it saw action in the Italian Campaign, in the Anzio Campaign and on the Gothic Line, with the 66th Infantry Brigade, which was part of the 1st Infantry Division. The 2nd Royal Scots were serving in 66th Brigade alongside the 1st Hertfordshire Regiment and 11th Lancashire Fusiliers. In January 1945 it moved to Palestine with the rest of the 1st Infantry Division, where it was active in security duties in October and November, and was then redeployed to the Suez Canal Zone in December 1945.

The 7th/9th Battalion was still part of the 155th Infantry Brigade and was attached to the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, which was trained for mountain warfare and airlanding operations, but was never used in this way. In October 1944 they moved to the Netherlands, fighting in the Battle of the Scheldt as part of the First Canadian Army, where the 52nd Division served with distinction, and then participating in Operation Blackcock and the advance to the Rhine; it crossed the Rhine in March 1945 and advanced to Bremen by the end of the war.

The 8th Battalion, Royal Scots was raised on 2 August 1939 as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 7th/9th Battalion. They remained in the United Kingdom as part of 44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade, alongside the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers and 6th King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. The brigade was a part of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, which would gain an excellent reputation in the campaign, and itself was formed a 2nd Line duplicate of the 1st Line 52nd Division. In June 1944, they landed in Normandy as part of Operation Overlord and fought in the Battle for Caen in Operation Epsom and later at the Second Battle of the Odon and Operation Bluecoat. They then fought in the North West Europe Campaign, from Paris to the Rhine, until the end of the war; it entered Belgium in September, crossed the Rhine in March 1945 and advanced to Hamburg by the end of the war.

===Post-war period (1945–2004)===

In February 1949, the 2nd Battalion disbanded, leaving the regiment with only a single regular battalion for the first time since the 17th century.

The 7th/9th (Highlanders) and 8th Battalions were reconstituted in the Territorial Army in 1947. Both battalions remained until 1961, when the latter was absorbed and the single battalion retitled the 8th/9th Battalion. In 1967 this was disbanded and reconstituted as two separate companies, A Company (The Royal Scots) of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers, and A Company (8th/9th Royal Scots) of The Royal Scots and Cameronians Territorials. By 1971, both companies were in the battalions of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers, and though the Royal Scots name was retained in the title the regiment no longer had a Territorial Army element.

The 1st Battalion briefly saw service in the Korean War in 1953, as part of 29th Infantry Brigade; after a brief spell in Egypt, they deployed to Cyprus from June 1955 to February 1956. They then spent two years in England, two in Berlin, one in Scotland, two in Libya, and four in England. In 1964, they deployed to Aden, then back to England and a three-year spell in Germany with the British Army of the Rhine.
1970 to 1974 was spent in Britain as part of the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force, with the battalion undertaking two four-month tours of duty in Northern Ireland. The battalion was then posted to Cyprus in early 1974. Unfortunately, Turkey invaded the island and created the &quot;Green Line&quot;, which still partitions the island. During the action of moving service families and holidaymakers to safety from Limassol, Piper Malcolm Halliday played at the roadside becoming known as &quot;The piper of Cyprus&quot;. This had put the Regiment on a war footing and they were involved in riots attacking RAF Akrotiri and protection of the Sovereign Area Base of Episkopi. They were relieved in early 1975 returning unexpectedly to Kirknewton near Edinburgh and did a further four-month tour of Northern Ireland, where three soldiers were lost in a roadside bomb attack. They moved to Münster in mid-1976 as the Nuclear Convoy Battalion charged with the protection of 8 Regiment RCT. In this role, the Battalion was equipped with Land Rovers, a change from the normal equipment used by previous and subsequent NCB units, which were armoured infantry battalions. Returning to Scotland in 1979, C Company was detached as &#x27;C Battalion&#x27; providing administrative support to the Edinburgh Tattoo. In 1980, they undertook a two-month tour in Northern Ireland, and moved there under 39th Infantry Brigade in 1981 for a two-year deployment. In 1983, they returned to Kirknewton for two years and during this time they were deployed to the Falkland Islands for four months. In 1985, they returned to Germany, deploying to the Persian Gulf in 1990 for Operation Desert Storm.

In 1994, the battalion gained a company of Gurkhas, who were later transferred to The Highlanders. Deployment in the 1990s included a further one-year tour to Northern Ireland. The Battalion was deployed to Bosnia for the first time as part of SFOR in September 2002 for six months prior to their deployment in November 2003 to Iraq as part of Operation Telic for six months, returning to Iraq again in January 2006.

===Restructuring of the Infantry (2004–2006)===
Until 2004, the Royal Scots had been one of five line infantry regiments never to be amalgamated in its entire history, a claim shared by The Green Howards, The Cheshire Regiment, The Royal Welch Fusiliers and The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. When five Scottish regiments were amalgamated to form the Royal Regiment of Scotland on 28 March 2006, the Royal Scots Battalion and the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers Battalion initially maintained their identities as separate battalions.

However almost immediately the Ministry of Defence moved to amalgamate the two battalions. This was not a new idea: the origins of the combined entity, Royal Scots Borderers, dates from the 1990 &quot;Options for Change&quot; review, when it was initially announced that the Royal Scots and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers would amalgamate. That amalgamation was subsequently rescinded. The Royal Scots Battalion and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers Battalion duly amalgamated on 1 August 2006 – upon their amalgamation, the new battalion took the name Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion Royal Regiment of Scotland.

The remaining Territorial element of the Royal Scots, a rifle company of 52nd Lowland Regiment, was likewise amalgamated, becoming A (Royal Scots Borderers) Company of 6th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland.

==Nicknames==
The regiment is known by the nickname &quot;Pontius Pilate&#x27;s Bodyguard&quot; which apparently was the result of a 17th-century boasting contest with the French &quot;Régiment de Picardie&quot; regarding the respective seniority of each regiment.

&quot;Picardie&quot;, the senior French infantry regiment, was formed in 1562, whereas the Scots had been raised in 1625 as Hepburn&#x27;s Regiment and only entered French service in 1635 but, it is said, claimed a lineage from Scots in French service dating back to the C13th. Versions of this tradition vary but the story turns on the existence of either one regiment or the other dating back to service under Pontius Pilate at the time of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion. The most common version tells of the name &#x27;Pontius Pilate&#x27;s Bodyguard&#x27; being tossed by the French as a jibe against the Scots. They replied that if their regiment had been on guard the night of the Crucifixion, the Sepulchre would not have been empty the next morning.

The 2nd Battalion was sardonically referred to as &quot;The First to Foot It&quot; during the Battle of Hong Kong.

==Football==
The football team of the 1st Battalion was a member of the Irish Football League for the 1899–1900 season, while deployed in Victoria Barracks, Belfast.

The 2nd Battalion team won several competitions in the 1890s, including the Surrey Cup, Malta Cup, Secunderabad Cup, Harris Cup, and Bombay Rovers Cup.

==Uniform==
White facings on a red coat were worn until &quot;royal blue&quot; distinctions were adopted in the early 18th century. The Scottish thistle of St Andrew featured on belt-plates and other parts of the uniform. The standard red/scarlet and blue uniform of most line infantry regiments was retained until &quot;Lowland&quot; dress was adopted in 1881. For the Royal Scots this included a scarlet doublet, tartan trews and (from 1904) a dark blue Kilmarnock bonnet with diced band, scarlet toorie and black-cock feather. This continued as the regimental full dress uniform until 1939, although worn only to a limited extent after 1914. The No. 1 Dress worn during the final decades of the regiment&#x27;s separate existence consisted of a dark blue bonnet with regimental dicing, dark blue doublet, and Hunting Stewart tartan trews.

<text>The Maya ruins of Belize include a number of well-known and historically important pre-Columbian Maya archaeological sites. Belize is considered part of the southern Maya lowlands of the Mesoamerican culture area, and the sites found there were occupied from the Preclassic (2000 BCE–200 CE) until and after the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.

Many sites are in danger due to destruction by construction companies, which frequently source road fill from the ancient ruins.

==Caracol==
Historically the most important site, Caracol (&#x27;the snail&#x27; in Spanish), is located in western Belize, near the border with Guatemala and within the Chiquibul Forest Reserve. Caracol was the center of one of the largest Maya kingdoms and today contains the extant remains of thousands of structures. The city was an important player in the Classic period political struggles of the southern Maya lowlands, and is known for defeating and subjugating Tikal (while allied with Calakmul, located in Campeche, Mexico).

==Cerros==
The site of Cerros, located on Corozal Bay in northern Belize, is notable as one of the earliest Maya sites, reaching its apogee during the Late Preclassic on Corozal Bay, and for the presence of an E-Group, a unique structural complex found in Maya architecture.

==Lamanai==
Lamanai, located on the New River in Orange Walk District, is known for being the longest continually-occupied site in Mesoamerica. The initial settlement of Lamanai occurred during the Early Preclassic, and it was continuously occupied up to and through the colonization of the area. During the Spanish conquest of Yucatán, the conquistadores established a Roman Catholic church at Lamanai, but a revolt by the native Maya drove them away. The extant remains of the church are still standing today. 

There are 3 Mayan temples in the Lamanai archaeological reserve: Mask Temple, High Temple and Temple of the Jaguar, along with ball courts. From a town of Tower Hill to the north, you take a boat along the New River to get to the site. Howler monkeys and boa constrictors have also been seen on the hiking trail to the temples.

<doc id="574861" wikidata="Q7712983" url="?curid=574861" title="The Alan Young Show">
<text>The Alan Young Show is an American radio and television series presented in diverse formats over a nine-year period and starring English-born comedian Alan Young.

==Radio==
The series began on NBC Radio, running June 28, 1944 - September 20, 1944, as a summer replacement for Eddie Cantor&#x27;s program with Sal Hepatica as sponsor. Young&#x27;s character was &quot;a bashful young man&quot;. The show also featured vocalist Bea Wain, with music by Peter Van Steeden.

From October 3, 1944, to June 28, 1946, the program was on ABC Radio with Young&#x27;s girlfriend Betty portrayed by Jean Gillespie and Doris Singleton and with Ed Begley as Betty&#x27;s father. Will Glickman and Jay Sommers were the writers.

The program returned to NBC September 20, 1946, - May 30, 1947, with Ipana as sponsor. It was off in 1948. When it returned to NBC January 11, 1949 - July 5, 1949, Louise Erickson played Betty and Jim Backus was heard as wealthy and snobbish playboy Hubert Updike III. Don Wilson was the announcer, and George Wylie provided the music. Helen Mack was the producer and director.

==Television==

Young had his first television program on the West Coast beginning on March 14, 1950, and the network version of &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot; debuted on CBS on April 6, 1950, as a variety, sketch comedy show. Each program typically contained a monologue, one or two songs by a vocalist and two skits.

The show went on hiatus after its March 27, 1952, episode. When it returned for its final season on February 15, 1953, the tone and format of the show changed into the more conventional sitcom, with Young playing a bank teller.The show alternated weeks with Ken Murray&#x27;s &quot;The Ken Murray Show&quot; under the title &quot;Time to Smile&quot;. In the last two weeks of the season, the format returned to its earlier style, but it was cancelled at the end of the season. It ended on June 21, 1953.

In 1951, &quot;The Alan Young Show&quot; received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Series, and Young won the Best Actor Emmy Award.

=== Personnel ===
Regulars on the first version included Polly Bergen (in her national TV debut), Ben Wright, Joseph Kearns, Mabel Paige, Phillips Tead and the Lud Gluskin Orchestra. Nina Bara was also a featured comedienne. On the second version, Dawn Addams played Young&#x27;s girlfriend and Melville Faber portraying his son. John Heistand was the announcer. Lud Gluskin directed the orchestra.

Ralph Levy and Dick Linkroum produced and directed, and Joe Connolly and Bob Mosher produced and wrote for the program. Alan Dinehart and Edward Bernds also directed. Other writers included Young, Leo Solomon, Dave Schwartz, Nate Monaster, and Stanley Shapiro.

===Critical response===
A review of the first three CBS episodes in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Young &quot;had some excellent sketches&quot; in the first two, &quot;But on the third show, when his writers let him down, Mr. Young was at very loose ends ...&quot; The review complimented Young&#x27;s &quot;sense of timing in the delivery of his lines&quot; but added that his &quot;dependence on the script is also evident in his repetitive opening monologues, which are apt to seem forced.&quot; The production, props, and settings received compliments.

A review of the program&#x27;s September 28, 1950, episode in the trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; called Young &quot;one of the most original performers in video&quot;. However, the reviewer questioned the use of two long skits when Young&#x27;s work came across better in shorter segments.

<doc id="574864" wikidata="Q26899865" url="?curid=574864" title="Lector">
<text>Lector is Latin for one who reads, whether aloud or not. In modern languages it takes various forms, as either a development or a loan, such as , , and . It has various specialized uses.

==Academic==
The title &quot;lector&quot; may be applied to lecturers and readers at some universities. There is also the title &quot;lector jubilate&quot;, which is an equivalent of Doctor of Divinity.

In the teaching of modern languages at universities in the United Kingdom, a native speaker who assists with language skills would be called a lector, and if a female she may be called a lectrice.

In Dutch higher education the title &quot;lector&quot; is used for the leader of a research group (&quot;lectoraat&quot;) at a university of applied sciences. The title is officially translated to &quot;professor&quot; in English. The lector has a comparable set of tasks as (higher ranked) full professors at a (research) university, albeit at an applied rather than a fundamental scientific level.

==Ecclesiastical==

A religious reader is sometimes referred to as a &quot;lector&quot;. The lector proclaims the Scripture readings used in the Liturgy from the official liturgical book (lectionary).

==Television==
In Polish, &quot;lektor&quot; is also used to mean &quot;off-screen reader&quot; or &quot;voice-over artist&quot;. A &quot;lektor&quot; is a (usually male) reader who provides the Polish voice-over on foreign-language programmes and films where the voice-over translation technique is used. This is the standard localization technique on Polish television and (as an option) on many DVDs; full dubbing is generally reserved for children&#x27;s material.

==Cigar factory lectors==

Historically, lectors (known as &quot;lectores&quot; in Cuba) or readers in a cigar factory entertained workers by reading books or newspapers aloud, often left-wing publications, paid for by unions or by workers pooling their money. In the United States, the custom was common in the cigar factories of Ybor City in Tampa but was discontinued after the Ybor City cigar makers&#x27; strike of 1931.

The practice apparently originated in Cuba. &quot;Lectores&quot; were introduced in 1865 to educate and relieve boredom among cigar workers. &quot;Lectores&quot;, and their reading material, are chosen by the workers of the cigar factory. &quot;Lectores&quot; often take on extra-official roles and formerly acted as &quot;spurs to dissent&quot;. , UNESCO is considering designating the profession a form of &quot;intangible cultural heritage&quot;.
The &quot;Montecristo&quot; brand of cigars derives its name for the fondness that cigar makers had for listening to &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.

<doc id="574866" wikidata="Q1484650" url="?curid=574866" title="GAU-12 Equalizer">
<text>The General Dynamics GAU-12/U Equalizer is a five-barrel 25 mm Gatling-type rotary cannon. The GAU-12/U is used by the United States, Italy and Spain, which mount the weapon in their attack jets such as the AV-8B Harrier II, airborne gunships such as the Lockheed AC-130, and land-based fighting vehicles.
A lighter four-barrel version, designated GAU-22/A, is mounted on F-35 Lightning II fighter jets.

==Development==
The five-barrel Equalizer cannon was developed in the late 1970s, based on the mechanism of the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger cannon, but firing a new NATO series of 25 mm ammunition. The GAU-12/U cannon is operated by an 11 kW (15 hp) electric motor, or in external mounts supplied by a bleed air driven pneumatic system. Its rate of fire is normally 3,600 rounds per minute, with a maximum of 4,200 rounds per minute. For use in the AC-130 gunship, the fire rate is limited to 1,800 rounds per minute in order to conserve ammunition and reduce barrel wear.

===GAU-22/A===
The GAU-22/A is a four-barrel version of the GAU-12/U designed for use on the F-35 Lightning II. 
The GAU-22/A&#x27;s major difference is the use of four barrels, rather than the GAU-12/U&#x27;s five barrels. The GAU-22/A is lighter and has a reduced rate of fire of 3,300 rounds per minute, but maintains the same, high accuracy of 5 milliradians, 80% circle of the GAU-12 and A-10&#x27;s GAU-8. The weapon is produced by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems.

The Nammo 25 mm PGU-47/U APEX (Armor Piercing with Explosive) projectile has been developed for the GAU-22/A.
It features a tungsten carbide penetrator in the tip and an explosive fragmentation body, to be multi-purpose against both hardened and soft targets. Also, the presence of a clockworking inertia-driven mechanical fuze in the mid-body, protects the round from shocks, misfires and cookoffs, making it safer to handle and fire.

==Uses==
The current principal application for the Equalizer is the AV-8 Harrier IIs of the United States Marine Corps, Italian Navy and Spanish Navy. The Harrier II carries the Equalizer system in a pair of detachable pods mounted on the fuselage underside, with the cannon in the port pod and 300 rounds of ammunition in the starboard pod, fed through a bridge at the aft ends of the pods that also contains the drive system for the gun (unlike previous Harriers which used dual cannons, with each pod containing a 30mm ADEN gun and its own ammunition supply). The complete installation, which includes a double-ended feed system that returns empty cartridges to the magazine, weighs 900 lb (410 kg) empty and 1,230 lb (560 kg) loaded. The detachable pods are located and shaped to be interchangeable with the usual ventral strakes or fences under the Harrier, both serving to help trap a cushion of high-pressure air under the aircraft to add lift while in hover mode. The strakes can easily be removed and the pods attached in their place, serving the same function while adding useful firepower.

RAF and Fleet Air Arm Harriers did not adopt the Equalizer for their Harrier GR7 and GR9s. The British had originally planned a pair of ADEN 25 guns (using the same ammunition as the GAU-12/U, but based on the 30 mm ADEN cannon). That gun was canceled in 1999 after protracted development problems, and British Harrier GR7/9s were without gun armament until retirement.

The Equalizer is also used in the AC-130U Spooky gunship, where one cannon is mounted on the port side, and the U.S. Marine Corps LAV-AD air-defense vehicle. Other applications have been planned for the GAU-12/U, including a mounting for the AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter.

The Equalizer was also used as the basis for the Sea Vulcan 25, a turret mounted gun for naval ship self-defense, although not as a Close-In Weapon System, as the gun was not automatic nor did it use radar tracking. Instead the gun was manually aimed using a digital gun sight and fire control. Sea Vulcan consisted of a 540-round helical drum magazine, a one-piece aluminum turret that can be opened with just a screwdriver, and the main gun. One unique advantage of the system was that it was capable of operating independently of ship&#x27;s power; the gun and ammunition magazine were powered by a pneumatic drive and the turret motor by twin lead–acid batteries.

Intended as a higher-firepower alternative to conventional deck-mounted machine guns and cannon, the weapon employs the Navy&#x27;s Mk 24 target designator and laser range finder for enhanced accuracy. The gun was developed in the mid-1980s as a cost-effective protection for ships smaller than frigate or corvette or patrol boats, but did not enter this service.

The GAU-12 was utilized as the principal armament for the Rutan ARES.

The four-barrel GAU-22 is carried internally by the F-35A (the CTOL version of the F-35) on the port side of the fuselage, with 181 PGU-47/U APEX rounds. In contrast, the F-35B STOVL and C CATOBAR aircraft mount the GAU-22 in a stealthy external gun pod under the fuselage, together with 220 rounds.

<text>Mangrove crabs are crabs that live in and around mangroves. They belong to many different species and families and have been shown to be ecologically significant by burying and consuming leaf litter. Mangrove crabs have a variety of phylogenies because mangrove crab is an umbrella term that encompasses many species of crabs. Two of the most common families are sesarmid and fiddler crabs. They are omnivorous and are predated on by a variety of mammals and fish. They are distributed widely throughout the globe on coasts where mangroves are located. Mangrove crabs have wide variety of ecological and biogeochemical impacts due to the biofilms that live in symbiosis with them as well as their burrowing habits. Like many other crustaceans, they are also a human food source and have been impacted by humans as well as climate change.

== Species and distribution ==
Current estimates place the number of mangrove crab species at 481 in 6 different families, with new species being discovered frequently. Mangrove crabs primarily live in the Indo-West Pacific region in mudflats along tropical coasts. The largest habitats for mangrove crabs are in Southeast Asia, South America, and Northern Australia. As their name suggests, they are primarily found among mangrove tree forests and form symbiotic relationships with the trees, restricting their habitat to where the trees can grow.

=== Phylogeny ===
A variety of different species are what makeup the umbrella term of mangrove crabs. The two main crabs that typically dominate mangrove ecosystems are the sesarmid (Grapsidae) and fiddler crabs (Ocypodidae). The main difference between the two crab groups is their foraging habits. Litter ingested by sesarmid crabs forms fragmented organic material that helps stimulate microbial respiration, in contrast fiddler crabs remove reactive organic carbon. Mangrove crabs are a part of the Animalia kingdom and are put into the Arthropoda phylum, Malacostraca class, and Decapoda order. Mangrove crabs can be classified into six different families: Camptandriidae, Dotillidae, Macrophthalmidae, Ocypodidae, Sesarmidae, and Oziidae.

=== Types of mangrove crabs ===
* Sesarmid crabs
* Fiddler crabs
* &quot;Aratus pisonii&quot;, Americas
* &quot;Haberma&quot;, genus of small mangrove crabs, Indo-Pacific, including:
** &quot;Haberma tingkok&quot;, Hong Kong
* &quot;Metopograpsus messor&quot;, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Metopograpsus thukuhar&quot;, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Neosarmatium meinerti&quot;, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Neosarmatium smithi&quot;, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Parasesarma leptosoma&quot;, western Indian Ocean
* &quot;Perisesarma&quot;, genus with 23 species, primarily Indo-Pacific, with two West African species, including:
** &quot;Perisesarma bidens&quot;, Indo-Pacific
** &quot;Perisesarma guttatum&quot;, western Indian Ocean
* &quot;Scylla serrata&quot;, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Scylla tranquebarica&quot;, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Sesarma&quot;, genus with close to 20 species, many of which live in mangroves, Americas, Indo-Pacific
* &quot;Ucides cordatus&quot;, western Atlantic Ocean
== Ecology and biogeochemistry ==

=== Diet and predators ===
When young, mangrove crabs get most of their nutrients from polychaete worms and a multitude of microorganisms found living in the sediments and leaves of their environment. As they grow older mangrove crabs are generally detritivores with their diet consisting of already dead organic material. Mangrove crabs consume a large amount of plant material but are primarily omnivorous. In the mangrove swamp this includes dead leaves and corpses of other crustaceans, even that of their own species. In some cases, mangrove crabs may also eat fresh mangrove leaves. Mangrove crabs are predated on by wading birds, fish, sharks, monkeys, hawks, and raccoons. The larvae of mangrove crabs is a major source of food for juvenile fish in waterways near the crabs. Adult mangrove crabs are food for the crab plover among other protected species. To protect themselves the crabs can climb trees. The only other crustaceans that climb trees are hermit crabs.

=== Habitat and ecosystem engineering ===

Mangrove crabs often construct and inhabit burrows in mangrove sediment. These burrows aid them in enduring the extremes that can be found in mangroves at high and low tide, allowing them to maintain more constant and ideal temperatures and oxygen levels. These constants can additionally aid other small benthic fauna, like polychaetes and juvenile crabs. Mangrove crabs may plug their burrows at intervals determined by their circadian rhythms, or they may leave them open. The variety in structures and maintenance of these burrows may lead to a variety of different impacts on mangrove sediments, such as increasing or decreasing erodibility. Fiddler crabs generally have very simple 10–40 cm “J-shaped” burrows, while sesarmid crabs that burrow often create complex, branching burrows that can reach over 100 cm in depth. Both types of crab significantly increase the surface area of the sediment and water/air interface to similar extents when scaled for relative abundance. These burrows also result in significant burial and downward travel of mangrove leaves. The burrowing dynamics of mangrove crabs dramatically impacts ecosystems, these dynamics were impacted by both abiotic factors like soil composition, and biotic factors like root depth and tree density.

Mangrove crabs modify particle size, nutrient availability, particle distribution, redox reactions, and organic matter. Aeration allows for additional microbial decomposition, oxidation of iron, and reduction of sulfur by anaerobic microbes. This leads to extremely high pyrite concentrations in mangrove soils, and removal of sulfides that negatively impact plant growth. Surface soils are similarly impacted when mixed by mangrove crab legs.

Depending on its nitrogen content, burial of detritus in crab burrows can stimulate microbial growth and activity and lead to variation in mangrove soils’ carbon dioxide efflux, ammonium content, and nitrate content.

The feces of mangrove crabs may help form a coprophagous food chain which contributes to mangrove secondary production.

=== Biofilms ===
Biofilm endosymbiosis occurs on the gills of some mangrove crabs, namely &quot;Aratus pisonii&quot; and &quot;Minuca rapax&quot;. Each species of these mangrove crabs likely have distinct bacterial compositions. These microbial biofilms are locations of nitrogen transformation, particularly nitrogen fixation. Bacteria like &quot;Cyanobacteria&quot;, &quot;Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria&quot;, and &quot;Bacteroidota&quot; have been found on mangrove crab carapaces&quot;.&quot; The biofilms served as a net nitrogen sink and a source of ammonium and dissolved nitrogen to the environment. The importance of the biofilm may be dependent on if the crabs live primarily in burrows or outside burrows. Crabs that live outside burrows may consume their nitrogen from microphytobenthos, while crabs that live inside their burrows may rely more on their associated microbes.

== Human impacts ==

=== Climate change ===
Ideal mangrove crab habitats rely heavily on coastal depth and surface temperature. Climate change due to anthropogenic activities is likely to create fluctuations in these two factors, driving the mangrove crab habitats to higher latitudes. As a result, it is predicted that mangrove habitats will continually shrink for the majority of crab species. This shrinking of habitat space isolates crab communities and shrinks genetic diversity, making many species more vulnerable to extinction.

=== Crabbing ===
Like many other crustaceans, mangrove crabs have historically been caught, prepared and eaten by people all over the world. Crab meat can be prepared simply by boiling the crab either dead or alive until the shell turns from black to red. This practice may be threatened by human activities, however, as microplastics have been found to be abundantly common in the gills of mangrove crabs due to human pollution. This not only negatively affects the health of the crabs, but could affect the health of humans who consume them.

=== Land use change ===
Around 6,000 km2 of mangrove was deforested between 1996 and 2016, usually redeveloped for fish and shrimp aquaculture, rice cultivation, palm oil plantations, and sometimes urbanization. Diversity of mangrove crabs does not seem to be negatively affected in abandoned aquaculture plots, though logging has significant negative effects on mangrove crab diversity.

<doc id="574880" wikidata="Q5368004" url="?curid=574880" title="Union shop">
<text>In labor law, a union shop, also known as a post-entry closed shop, is a form of a union security clause. Under this, the employer agrees to either only hire labor union members or to require that any new employees who are not already union members become members within a certain amount of time. Use of the union shop varies widely from nation to nation, depending on the level of protection given trade unions in general.

==Canada==
In 1946, Justice Ivan Rand of the Supreme Court of Canada crafted what became known as the &quot;Rand formula&quot;. Appointed as arbiter to settle the Ford Strike of 1945, Rand concluded that both federal and provincial labor law made strong trade unions national policy. If workers were allowed to opt out of paying union dues, the free rider problem would undermine this policy. Rand went further to argue that the free rider problem undermines workplace order by causing resentment between union and non-union employees.

Rand&#x27;s decision required all workers to pay union dues, but protected the right of workers to not join the union or otherwise participate in sustaining it. In the late 1940s and 1950s, many Canadian provinces incorporated the &quot;Rand formula&quot; into their labor laws. By 1997, the federal government and six provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan) imposed the Rand formula on labor relations. Most of the laws provided for a religious exemption that imposed donation to a charity rather than union dues.

By 1994, 9 percent of collective bargaining agreements in Canada required the closed shop, while 42.3 percent required the union shop and 39.2 percent used the Rand formula. Just 3 percent used the agency shop, while 6.5 percent had the open shop. Alberta appointed an investigative committee in 1994 to see if adoption of American-style &quot;right to work&quot; laws would benefit the province. The committee strongly rejected the policy after Albertan employers strongly supported the union shop. Union shop clauses in Canadian collective bargaining agreements were enforceable.

The closed shop is legal in all Canadian jurisdictions as of 2006, and unions may (if they wish) negotiate forms of union security agreements that provide less than the union shop.

==Japan==
Article 7, Section 1 of the Trade Union Act of 1949 of Japan specifically permits the negotiation of union shop provisions, provided that the union represents a majority of workers at the worksite. However, Article 28 of the Constitution of Japan protects freedom of association. Japanese courts have wrestled with the two conflicting legal values, and found that the right to organize is superior to the right to freedom of association. However, court have crafted five conditions for a union shop agreement to be accepted:

#Workers must remain free to join a union that does not represent a majority of workers in the plant.
#If a worker withdraws from the majority union to join the minority union, the union shop agreement may no longer cover the withdrawing worker.
#New workers retain the right to join a union that does not represent a majority of workers in the plant, and cannot be forced to join the majority union.
#The union shop agreement is nullified if a union no longer represents a majority of workers at the worksite.
#If a worker withdraws from the majority union to form a new union, the union shop agreement may no longer cover the withdrawing worker.

Article 17 of the Trade Union Act requires that the collective bargaining agreement be extended to all workers of the same type if 75 percent of that class of the employer&#x27;s workers are already covered by the agreement. Although this may appear to impose the union shop, in practice defining what constitutes a &quot;similar type of worker&quot; has proven too difficult and Section 17 is rarely enforced.

In 1996, 62.1 percent of all Japanese collective bargaining agreements contained a union shop provision. As of 1999, 60 percent did so. Other forms of union security agreements, such as the closed shop and agency shop, are extremely rare.

Japanese labor law treats large employers differently from small employers, and union shop provisions are much less likely to be negotiated in small workplaces. For example, Chalmers cites 1979 data showing that 50 percent of all workplaces in Japan had a union shop provision. But while 73 percent of employers with more than 1,000 workers had such agreements, just 59 percent of employers with 500 to 999 workers did so. Some agreements are ambiguously worded, making their enforcement problematic. Other union shop provisions are tied to various requirements that the union promote &quot;industrial peace&quot;, such as mandatory arbitration for all disputes and a relinquishment of the right to strike.

==United States==
The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (also known as the Taft-Hartley Act) made the closed shop illegal in the United States. The Supreme Court in &quot;Pattern Makers v. NLRB&quot;, 473 U.S. 95 (1985), also held that a union member may resign from the union at any time without notice, thereby enabling the worker to work during a strike without being subject to sanctions from the union. Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), as amended by the Taft-Hartley Act, and held by the Supreme Court in &quot;Communications Workers of America v. Beck&quot;, in a union security agreement, unions are authorized by statute to collect from non-members only those fees and dues necessary to perform its duties as a collective bargaining representative known as agency fees. Compelling payment of agency fees from non-union employees in the public sector was held unconstitutional in &quot;Janus v. AFSCME&quot;, in June 2018. The agency fee is that portion of union dues that is attributable to the cost of representing employees in collective bargaining and in providing services to all represented employees, but not, with certain exceptions, to the union&#x27;s political activities or organizing employees of other employers. Additional restrictions apply to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA) and unionized governmental employees.

The NLRA requires that employees must be given at least 30 days from the date of hire to join the union before they may be subject to being fired for failure to join the union or pay dues; shorter periods apply in the construction industry. The RLA gives employees 60 days to join the union. The union cannot, however, require that an employee become a member &quot;in good standing&quot; — that is, do more than pay dues or their equivalent. While a union shop agreement that, by its literal terms, requires an employee to become a member in good standing might appear to be unlawful on its face and therefore unenforceable, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the courts have uniformly interpreted such clauses to require no more than what the law permits (such as payment of dues).

Under United States labor law, a private sector union can expel a member from the union for any number of reasons, so long as it provides the member with the minimum due process required by the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and does not do so for reasons prohibited by law (such as the member&#x27;s race or protected political activities within the union). The union cannot, on the other hand, use a union shop agreement to require an employer to discharge a member for failure to maintain membership in good standing unless that member has been expelled from the union for failure to pay uniformly required union dues and fees. If the union expels a member for some reason other than failure to pay dues, it effectively terminates any right it might have had to demand that the employee pay dues thereafter or request that the employee be discharged for failure to do so.

The NLRA imposes additional requirements before a union can invoke a union shop agreement clause to require an employer to fire an employee who has failed to pay dues. While the union does not have to give the individual employee the sort of trial-type hearing required by the LMRDA to expel a union member for other reasons, the union must give the employee a detailed written explanation of the amount of delinquent dues that the employee owes and how those dues were calculated, and allow the employee a reasonable opportunity to pay those delinquent dues and fees before it asks that the employee be fired. In addition, the union must give all employees roughly the same opportunity to cure any delinquencies before requesting discharge; if the union gives one employee two weeks to pay delinquent dues, it must do the same for all others. The union is not, on the other hand, required to withdraw a request that an employee be fired for failure to pay delinquent dues if the employee makes the payment after the deadline but before the employer has effected the discharge. A union may owe back pay to employees who have been fired without these procedural protections; the employer may be liable if it effects the discharge when it knew or should have known that the union had not complied with the minimum requirements of the NLRA.

Under the NLRA, the union may demand payment only of those dues for periods when an employee was covered by a collective bargaining agreement that contained a valid union shop agreement. A union shop agreement may not be made retroactive to a period prior to the execution of the agreement. The union may not demand that an employee be fired for failure to pay extraordinary assessments that are not part of regularly, uniformly imposed dues. The LMRDA sets standards for the procedures that the union must follow when asking members to approve an increase in dues.

Union-represented employees covered by a union shop agreement may ask the NLRB to hold a &quot;deauthorization election&quot; to allow all bargaining unit employees to vote to determine whether the clause will continue to remain in effect. No such procedure exists under the RLA.

==United Kingdom==
The term &quot;union shop&quot; is not used in the UK but it appears to be equivalent to a post-entry closed shop. These are not permitted by the Employment Act 1990.

==Holy See==
The lay employees of the Vatican are members of a union shop, the Association of Vatican Lay Workers, making the Vatican the world&#x27;s most unionized sovereign state.

<doc id="574881" wikidata="Q1400206" url="?curid=574881" title="Alien Nation (TV series)">
<text>Alien Nation is a science fiction police procedural television series in the &quot;Alien Nation&quot; franchise that aired on Fox from September 18, 1989 to May 7, 1990. Adapted from the 1988 &quot;Alien Nation&quot; movie, it stars Gary Graham as Detective Matthew Sikes, a Los Angeles police officer reluctantly working with &quot;Newcomer&quot; alien Sam &quot;George&quot; Francisco, played by Eric Pierpoint. Sikes also has an on again-off again flirtation with a female Newcomer, Cathy Frankel, played by Terri Treas.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; included the series in their 2013 list of 60 shows that were &quot;Cancelled Too Soon&quot;.

==Plot==
The series is set in the near future in the United States. In 1990, a flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert containing a race of extraterrestrials, the Tenctonese, escaping from slavery under a cruel Overseer race. They are humanoid but have certain anatomical differences and have been bred with greater physical strength and intelligence. These Newcomers, as they are called, are accepted as the latest immigrants to the US. The series explores issues around their integration into the multicultural society of the US.

The storylines often are morality plays on the evils of racism and bigotry, using Newcomers as the discriminated minority. As fictional extraterrestrial immigrants, the Newcomers could stand in for social issues about various races, as well as sexual minorities such as gays and lesbians, and would invert the usual expectations. For instance, mid-way through the series, George becomes pregnant (the male of his species carrying the fetus for part of its gestation), and during much of the episode, dialog included lines like, &quot;If you females had to feel the pain we males feel during pregnancy, there wouldn&#x27;t be any babies.&quot; The series offers social commentary by illustrating what it means to be human and the often bizarre rituals we observe.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===
In an April 2, 2008 episode of &quot;Fanboy Radio&quot; (#463), creator Johnson explains: Having been responsible for science-fiction television series such as &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, was approached for the television adaptation of the 1988 film &quot;Alien Nation&quot;. He had no interest in the project and agreed to watch the film which left him unimpressed except for one scene when a Newcomer, George, leaves his suburban wife and child and goes to work.
Johnson returned to the network, which envisioned a weekly science-fiction version of &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, and sold them on a different concept of social commentary about what happens when a new minority appears overnight. He intended his version to be more akin to the film &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; than a traditional action film.

===Changes from the movie===

* In the movie version, human detective &quot;Matthew Sykes&quot; is played by James Caan. In the TV series, actor Gary Graham plays the role of &quot;Matthew Sikes&quot;.
* Detective George Francisco, (originally named &quot;Sam Francisco&quot; by the Human immigration authorities) the Newcomer detective, is played by Mandy Patinkin in the movie. Eric Pierpoint plays the character in the TV series.
* Many aspects of Newcomer culture are explored in the TV series, including childbirth, religion, family, history and longing for their home planet. In the movie, Newcomer culture is hinted at but never fully explored or rounded out.
* In the movie, Francisco has a wife named Susan (played by Kendall Conrad) and a son (called &quot;George Jr.&quot; in the credits, although Mandy Patinkin states that within the film, he was named &quot;Richard&quot; after Richard Nixon), played by Brian Lando. In the TV series, his wife is still named Susan (Michele Scarabelli), but his son is named Buck (Sean Six). He also has a daughter, Emily (Lauren Woodland) and gives birth to an additional daughter, Vessna.
* In the movie, Sykes&#x27;s daughter is married. In the TV series, she is unmarried and is of college age with a boyfriend.
* Matt and George both work for Captain Warner (Francis X. McCarthy) in the movie. In the TV series, it is Captain Bryon Grazer (Ron Fassler).

===Cancellation===
The weekly series ran for one season, from 1989 through 1990, and was one of the few successes the fledgling Fox Network had at the time. However, the network suffered from financial shortage caused by lower-than-expected advertising income. As a result, Fox executives cancelled all of their dramatic series for the 1990–1991 season. A second season of &quot;Alien Nation&quot; was clearly expected by the producers, as the season ended with a cliffhanger. The show built a strong fan base, and popular demand led to &quot;Dark Horizon&quot;, the episode that would have begun the second season, being novelized and adapted as a comic book as well as spawning a series of novels. Four years later, after a change of management at Fox, the story of &quot;Alien Nation&quot; continued with five television movies (including all the original cast), picking up with the cliffhanger.

==Episodes==
A spaceship transporting slaves from an alien planet, crash landed on earth. While trying to integrate into human society, the “Newcomers” are accepted by some and hated by others.

==Television movies==
==Home media==
The series was released on DVD by 20th Century Fox on January 3, 2006. The five telefilms that followed after the series was cancelled were released in Region 1 by Best Buy exclusively on September 11, 2007, and worldwide on April 15, 2008.

==Revival==
In June 2009, Syfy (formerly Sci-Fi Channel) announced that they were developing a new take on the series. Tim Minear (&quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;) was announced to pen the series. But later in 2014, it was reported that the series was cancelled by the network in favor of paranormal reality shows and professional wrestling. In 2015, it was reported that a remake of the series was again in the works, with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing the script.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 14,245 and a density of 293.89 persons per km2. The total area was 48.47 km2.

On January 1, 2005, Adogawa, along with the towns of Takashima, Imazu, Makino and Shin&#x27;asahi, and the village of Kutsuki (all from Takashima District), was merged to create the city of Takashima.

Adogawa is one of the more densely populated areas in Takashima City. There are many stores around the JR Adogawa Station.

Adogawa is well known for its fan ribs (the wooden part that comprises the skeleton of traditional Japanese hand fans), and roughly 80% of fan ribs made in Japan come from Adogawa.

In Adogawa, there is one prefectural high school, one junior high school, and five elementary schools. There are plans to create a new prefectural middle school within Adogawa High School by 2008.

Takashima is part of ancient Ōmi Province and has been settled since at least the Yayoi period. The Kofun period Emperor Keitai was born in what is now Takashima, and there are many burial tumuli within the city limits. The city is located on the shortest route between the Asuka and Nara period capitals of Japan and the Sea of Japan coastline and was thus an important thoroughfare for both domestic and international travel and commerce in the ancient period. It was also the site of a major battle of the Jinshin War. From the late Heian period and into the Kamakura period and beyond, the area came under then control of the powerful Sasaki clan and was ruled by a cadet branch of the clan, the Takashima clan, from their stronghold at Shimizuyama Castle. The clan was destroyed by Oda Nobunaga in the wars of the Sengoku period and after the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, much of the city area came under the control of the 20,000 &quot;koku&quot; Ōmizo Domain.

The village of Ōmizo was established within Takashima District, Shiga with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was elevated to town status on November 1, 1902. After merging with neighboring Takashima and Mizuo villages on April 29, 1943, it was renamed the town of Takashima. On January 1, 2005, Takashima merged with the towns of Adogawa, Imazu, Makino and Shin&#x27;asahi, and the village of Kutsuki (all from Takashima District) to form the city of Takashima.

==Government==
Takashima has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 18 members. Takashima contributes two members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Shiga 1st district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<text>was a town located in Takashima District, Shiga Prefecture, Japan.

== Population ==
As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 11,188 and a density of 340.68 persons per km2. The total area was 32.84 km2.

== History ==
On January 1, 2005, Shin&#x27;asahi, along with the towns of Takashima, Adogawa, Imazu and Makino, and the village of Kutsuki (all from Takashima District), was merged to create the city of Takashima.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Shin&#x27;asahi&quot; means &quot;new sunrise&quot; which derives from its western position on Lake Biwa.

== Access ==
Shin&#x27;asahi has a stop on the JR Kosei Line Shin-Asahi Station.

== Attractions ==
Shin&#x27;asahi is famous for it natural clear water that are taken from natural sources close to the town. There is at least one sake brewery in town which takes advantage of the availability of the water.

The area of Lake Biwa is fantastic for its natural surroundings. It has monkeys, bears and giant bamboo. Don&#x27;t be surprised to see children walking to school wearing bear bells, even though bear attacks are much rarer than in other parts of the world.

Water sports including swimming and windsurfing are activities during the summer. Winter activities include snowboarding in the nearby mountains.

<text>Tyrrhenians (Attic Greek: &quot;Turrhēnoi&quot;) or Tyrsenians (Ionic: &quot;Tursēnoi&quot;; Doric: &quot;Tursānoi&quot;) was the name used by the ancient Greeks authors to refer, in a generic sense, to non-Greek people, in particular pirates.

While ancient sources have been interpreted in a variety of ways, the Greeks always called the Etruscans Tyrsenoi, although not all Tyrsenians were Etruscans. Furthermore the languages of Etruscan, Rhaetian and Lemnian cultures have been grouped together as the Tyrsenian languages, based on their strong similarities.

==Earliest references==
The names are believed to be exonyms, only known to have been used by authors of Ancient Greek, though their origin is uncertain and apparently not Greek. They have been connected to (&quot;túrsis&quot;), also a &quot;Mediterranean&quot; loan into Greek, meaning &quot;tower&quot;. Direct connections with &quot;&quot;, the Latin exonym for the Etruscans, from *&quot;Turs-ci&quot;, have also been attempted. The French linguist Françoise Bader has alternatively hypothesized that &quot;Tyrsenoi&quot;–&quot;&quot; derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;to cross&quot;.

The first Greek author to mention the Tyrrhenians is the 8th-century BC Greek poet Hesiod, in his work, the Theogony. He merely described them as residing in central Italy alongside the Latins.

The Homeric hymn to Dionysus has Tyrsenian pirates seizing Dionysus:
After Herodotus&#x27; Histories a party of Lydians, wretched by a persistent famine, decided to migrate. Led by Tyrsenos, son of Atys, king of Lydia, they sailed to the west coast of central Italy where they settled in the region of the Umbri.

==Late references==
The Tyrrhenians are referred to as pirates by Ephorus of Cyme as reported by Strabo. The pirating actions of the Tyrrhenians would not have allowed the Greeks to found their colonies in Sicily before the 8th century BC.

In the 6th and 5th centuries BC, the name referred specifically to the Etruscans for whom the Tyrrhenian Sea is named, according to Strabo. In Pindar, the &quot;Tyrsenoi&quot; appear allied with the Carthaginians as a threat to Magna Graecia:
The name is also attested in a fragment by Sophocles.

The name becomes increasingly associated with the generic Pelasgians. Herodotus places them in Crestonia in Thrace, as neighbours of the Pelasgians. Similarly, Thucydides mentions them together with the Pelasgians and associates them with Lemnian pirates and with the pre-Greek population of Attica.

Lemnos remained relatively free of Greek influence until Hellenistic times, and the Lemnos stele of the 6th century BC was inscribed with a language very similar to Etruscan, which has led to the postulation of a Tyrrhenian language family of Etruscan, Lemnian and Raetic.

There is thus evidence that there was indeed at least a linguistic relationship between the Lemnians and the Etruscans. The circumstances of this are disputed; most scholars would ascribe Aegean Tyrrhenians to the Etruscan expansion from the 8th to the 6th centuries, putting the homeland of the Etruscans in Italy and the Alps, particularly because of their relation to the Alpine Rhaetian population. Another hypothesis connecting the Tyrrhenians and the Etruscans posits that the Etruscans derive at least partially from a 12th century BC invasion from the Aegean and Anatolia imposing itself over the Villanovan culture, with some scholars claiming a relationship or at least evidence of close contact between the Anatolian languages and the Etruscan language and adherents of the latter school of thought point to the legend of Lydian origin of the Etruscans referred to by Herodotus and Livy&#x27;s statement that the Rhaetians were Etruscans driven into the mountains by the invading Gauls. Critics of the theory point to the very scanty evidence of a linguistic relationship of Etruscan with Anatolian and to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who decidedly argues against an Etruscan-Lydian relationship. Furthermore, there is no archaeological evidence from material culture of such a cultural shift and of an eastern origins of the Etruscans, in modern times, all the evidence gathered so far by etruscologists points to an indigenous origin of the Etruscans. Just as the archaeological evidence is against the idea that the Rhaetians are descended from the Etruscans who fled from northern Italy because of the Gallic invasions, as the Rhaetians are archaeologically attested in their Alpine sites long before.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus states that &quot;there was a time when the Latins, the Umbrians, the Ausonians and many others were all called Tyrrhenians by the Greeks, the remoteness of the countries inhabited by these nations making their exact distinctions obscure to those who lived at a distance.&quot;

==Possible connection with Sea Peoples==
It has been hypothesised that the &quot;Teresh&quot;, who appear among other Sea Peoples in a number of Ancient Egyptian inscriptions from 1200 to 1150 BC, may be the same people as the Tyrsenians.

<text>Alien Nation is a 1988 American science fiction action film written by Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon and directed by Graham Baker. The ensemble cast features James Caan, Mandy Patinkin, and Terence Stamp. Its initial popularity inaugurated the beginning of the &quot;Alien Nation&quot; media franchise. The film depicts the assimilation of the &quot;Newcomers&quot;, an alien race settling in Los Angeles, much to the initial dismay of the local population. The plot integrates the neo-noir and buddy cop film genres with a science fiction theme, centering on the relationship between a veteran police investigator (Caan) and an extraterrestrial (Patinkin), the first Newcomer detective. The duo probe a criminal underworld while attempting to solve a homicide. &quot;Alien Nation&quot; explores murder, discrimination and science fiction.

The film was a co-production between American Entertainment Partners and 20th Century Fox, which distributed it theatrically. &quot;Alien Nation&quot; was released in the United States on October 7, 1988, and grossed over $32 million worldwide, becoming a moderate financial success. The film was met with mixed critical reviews before its theatrical release, although it has since gained a cult following. The motion picture spawned a short-lived television series, five television films, a set of comic books, and a number of novels, all in an attempt to continue the character development surrounding its fictional alien culture.

==Plot==
In 1988, a spaceship bearing 300,000 enslaved aliens known as &quot;Newcomers&quot; lands in the Mojave Desert. By 1991, they have settled in Los Angeles and some of them have joined the Los Angeles Police Department. Detective Matthew Sykes&#x27; partner is killed in a shootout with several Newcomers who are robbing a store; they also kill the store owner, the Newcomer Cecil Porter. Sykes&#x27; superior, Captain Warner, informs his squad that they will work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco. Sykes volunteers to team up with Francisco to investigate the homicide of Newcomer Warren Hubley, hoping to also be able to investigate his partner&#x27;s death, something he is officially barred from doing. The two do not work well: Sykes refuses to call him &quot;Sam Francisco&quot; and opts to call him &quot;George&quot; instead, and Francisco predicts Sykes will have difficulties due to his last name sounding like &quot;sai k&#x27;ss&quot; – &quot;shit head&quot; in the Newcomer language.

While at a crime lab, Francisco detects an abnormality on the body of one of the Newcomer criminals who was killed in the robbery. This leads Sykes and Francisco to a nightclub to question Newcomer Joshua Strader, but Strader is murdered by a criminal ring led by Newcomer businessman William Harcourt and his henchman Rudyard Kipling.

While investigating, the men find themselves becoming friendlier to each other. Francisco informs Sykes of a part of the Newcomer body to strike for maximum pain, which Sykes uses later; after discovering Newcomers get intoxicated on spoiled milk, they get drunk together, and Francisco confesses about not understanding the high ideals humans set without being able to attain them, and advises Sykes to reconnect with his estranged daughter.

Harcourt is in the advanced stages of launching a scheme to exploit the Newcomers by mass-producing Jabroka, a drug which was used to pacify Newcomers when they were slaves but has no beneficial effect on humans. The abnormality noticed by Francisco on the body of the Newcomer criminal turns out to be a visual sign of the drug&#x27;s influence. The Newcomers Hubley, Porter, and Strader were involved in the planning phases of the operation, but were later murdered due to Harcourt&#x27;s desire to exclude them from any future profits. When Sykes and Francisco locate the drug lab, Francisco displays a sudden fury at the thought of Jabroka being re-introduced to his people and destroys the lab. Francisco explains that it must be destroyed, and the mere existence of the drug must never be revealed, as it would risk the tenuous existence of every Newcomer on Earth.

Ultimately, Sykes and Francisco track down Harcourt, who is negotiating a timetable for the release of Jabroka. The detectives engage in a car chase with Harcourt and Kipling, ending in a head-on collision that leaves both parties injured. Harcourt escapes on foot; when cornered by Sykes, he takes an overdose of Jabroka that causes him to collapse, seemingly dead. The remaining Jabroka is destroyed, but Francisco reacts in shock when Sykes reports he overdosed; he explains that an overdose would cause a Newcomer to mutate in a larger, more dangerous form, and that humanity must never know Newcomers are capable of this.

Sykes and Francisco pursue Harcourt after he escapes from the coroner&#x27;s vehicle, catching up with him near a fishing pier, and Sykes fights him hand-to-hand on the open sea, eventually knocking him into the water; however, Sykes is pulled into the water as well. Harcourt&#x27;s body disintegrates due to direct contact with salt water, which is hazardous to Newcomer physiology. Francisco commandeers a police helicopter and rescues Sykes even though his arm suffers damage. When the pilot asks what was in the water with Sykes, Sykes responds that it was &quot;just another Slag&quot; - a pejorative term for Newcomers - protecting the secret.

Sykes and Francisco, now friends, attend Sykes&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s wedding together. Sykes has accepted Francisco as his partner and asks him to forgive Sykes for all the stupid things he will do and say in the years to come. Francisco reassures Sykes that he will - &quot;After all...you&#x27;re only human.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Origins and themes===
One out of twenty to twenty-five stories received each week by 20th Century Fox in 1988, Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s original screenplay for &quot;Alien Nation&quot; was submitted as a spec–script to producer Gale Anne Hurd. The agency representing the storyline asked the production staff to view it as quickly as possible due to it also being submitted to other film studios. Both Hurd and her director of development Ellen Collett had the same initial response, seeing the script as a real page-turner. According to Hurd, what really interested her about the film&#x27;s story was the whole approach to the immigrant setting and the extrapolation of that to a science fiction setting. The genre of science fiction, in regards to representing aliens, tends to usually be in the form of one or two beings as shown on network series like &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Typically, large numbers of stand-ins were not common in film since &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; twenty years earlier. Working with co-producer Richard Kobritz, Hurd secured funding from Fox Studios and began casting an experienced makeup team for the creation of the alien society.

Later, Hurd contacted cinematographer Adam Greenberg at his home in Israel to work on the production. Caught by surprise, Greenberg recalled, &quot;I was vacationing on the Dead Sea in a kibbutz (it was 125 degrees) and I got a call from Gale. That was the last thing to expect there.&quot;

Though mostly an action movie, &quot;Alien Nation&quot; was somewhat of a throwback to other similar genre films such as &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Silent Running&quot;. The alien &quot;Newcomers&quot; are relegated to a second-class status. Like other minorities, they live in their own neighborhoods, frequent their own clubs, and develop their own underground. Following the murder of a policeman, a human must partner up with an alien to solve the murder. Their uneasy alliance creates a social mistrust, dealing with issues such as prejudice and racism. By the end of the saga, the two completely different humanoids have combined their talents and overcome their social barriers to complete their task.

===Makeup===
Although several makeup effects companies were considered, 20th Century Fox chose Stan Winston Studios. Winston was not directly involved in the pre-production, but left the task to his top artists–Alec Gillis, Shane Mahan, John Rosengrant, Tom Woodruff, and Shannon Shea. Producer Gale Anne Hurd commented on creating the foundation for the makeup setting saying, &quot;The primary problem was how to sell an alien race that was humanoid without making it look like people in rubber suits—and how to make it affordable. We knew there was going to be a lot of makeup application time and removal time—that was a given.&quot; Artist Gillis recalled his involvement in the project saying, &quot;We were involved in everything from designing and sculpting the aliens to supervising a crew of about thirty people. We sculpted the main characters, supervised the molding and production of their appliances and oversaw the sculpting of the secondary and background characters.&quot; During the design phase, the producers supported the subtlety of the makeup and trying to make the aliens look as human as possible.

A preliminary design sketch for the aliens as described by Mahan, was that &quot;the males were going to have spines on top of their heads–kind of like a rooster&#x27;s comb–and when they got angry, these spines would raise up. That would&#x27;ve required a mechanical headpiece, and Graham Baker thought it was a little too extreme so we went with smooth heads instead.&quot; Coming close to a final design for the headpiece makeup, Woodruff explained how the masks had &quot;heavier brows and a heavier skin texture that looked more leathery, and there were more pronounced lumps on the backs of their heads. After we went into production on these masks, Graham Baker decided that he wanted the aliens to look even more subtle, so we streamlined the design once we started doing the principal characters.&quot;

Mike Spatola was head of the painting crew for the mask design. Hairless by design, the coordinators felt the masks should have spotted marks where hair would be present on humans. Each alien headpiece had to be custom painted with a spotting pattern to match every backup secondary piece used for individual characters. Each of the actors who played aliens also had their hands painted in a spot pattern, as an original plan of supplying them with appliances for hand pieces was discarded.

After the generic alien concept was finalized, each of the effects coordinators worked with a specific actor. Mahan chose to work with Mandy Patinkin, as well as Francisco&#x27;s son. Rosengrant worked with Leslie Bevis who played Cassandra. Woodruff worked on Terence Stamp who played the part of Harcourt. In trying to emphasize the uniqueness of the characters, Mahan commented, &quot;We wanted the audience to be able to recognize the actors immediately. They were all so good, it would have been a shame to cover them up completely.&quot; Other effects coordinators like Gillis remarked, &quot;The actor who played Trent Porter, for example–Brian Thompson–was a really rugged guy, so he came off looking like a really tough character. On the other hand, Kevyn Major Howard–who played Harcourt&#x27;s murderous henchman–had very delicate, boyish kind of features, so we used that quality to create a creepy juxtaposition.&quot; While effects coordinators were struggling to finish the final design and full-scale production of the alien prosthetics, Hurd chose makeup artist Zoltan Elek to supervise the overall application. Elek had previously worked on the film &quot;Mask&quot; and the character &quot;Max Headroom&quot;. Elek insisted that the alien coloration be much more closer to human skin tones rather than the originally chosen yellowish pigment. Elek recalled his disagreement with Winston as Stan felt, &quot;...the aliens should be a totally different color than the humans, with a lot of yellows, blues and grays. To me, that scheme was too monstrous–in fact, we ended up using it on the Harcourt monster at the climax.&quot; Another creative aspect of the makeup was the gradation between the principal and background masks. The crew of &quot;Alien Nation&quot; sought to avoid the same mistakes made in &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; twenty years earlier. As explained by Gillis, &quot;We had what we referred to as &#x27;A-B-C-D&#x27; makeups, ... The &#x27;A&#x27; makeups were those custom designed for the principal actors, while the &#x27;B&#x27; makeups were mix-and-match where we would recombine pieces from other actors to create a new character. Our &#x27;D&#x27; masks–the ones furthest from camera–were overhead slip latex masks &quot;incapable&quot; of changing expression. The &#x27;C&#x27; masks, however, were made of foam latex and could be glued down to get some expression from the characters in the middleground.&quot; Application of the Newcomer makeup known as &quot;spuds&quot; or &quot;potatoheads&quot; on set, required four hours; a task which Patinkin described as being &quot;a pain in the ass.&quot; Masks were manufactured in a production line to meet the enormous demand for the film. Mahan mused, &quot;We would pull the pieces out of the oven, fix them up, paint them and have them ready for pickup that afternoon to be taken to the set. The pieces were barely cold when Zoltan and his crew applied them.&quot;

For the final dramatic scene involving Harcourt&#x27;s demise, the rigged effects were handled in two stages. The first stage involved a dissolving head and body, while the second stage incorporated a flesh-less arm thrusting out of seawater. Rosengrant noted, &quot;While the dissolving makeup had to look extreme, it also had to appear realistic within the limits of the alien anatomy Winston&#x27;s crew had designed. We wanted to avoid the amorphous &#x27;blob-of-blood&#x27; look you see in so many of these slasher and monster pictures. We wanted to be able to see Harcourt&#x27;s bone structure rather than just the glob hanging off of it.&quot; For the visual appearance he added, &quot;Of course, we did use methocel slime to make it wet and nasty-looking, but the basic understructure was rooted in anatomy.&quot; For Harcourt&#x27;s facial disintegration, the coordinators came up with a foam rubber base makeup superimposed with a layer of gelatin appliances. Elek explained, the crew &quot;dug out chunks from the foam rubber pieces, filled the holes with Bromo Seltzer, then laid the gelatin appliances over the whole thing and colored them so you could not see the holes below. Once the stuntman, the camera and everyone else was in position, we took a large syringe filled with hot water and injected it into each of the Bromo Seltzer pockets as the camera started rolling. As the Bromo Seltzer started to fizzle, the hot water began eating its way through the gelatin skin and his face appeared to bubble and melt.&quot; In the end, Mahan remarked, &quot;We figured that going from something like the alien queen in &quot;Aliens&quot; to these straight prosthetic makeups would be simple, but it was really a lot of work.&quot;

===Set design and filming===
Numerous interior and exterior locations used to suit the needs of the story were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a five-month shooting schedule, three weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film, saying &quot;The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs.&quot; The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores on both sides of the street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew &quot;came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, &#x27;enter&#x27; and &#x27;open&#x27;, so that we could repeat them...&quot; while also mentioning how they &quot;brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with.&quot; The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn&#x27;t want to take down, the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties.

Certain fictional locations in the film such as the Encounters Club, was filmed at Club Hollywood on Hollywood Boulevard. Set decorator Jim Duffy, who was involved with the exotic dance scene at the club, used unique Austrian drapes to create a see-through design for actress Bevis who portrayed the character of Cassandra to perform around with. Smaller set areas for Cassandra&#x27;s dressing room, a couple of offices, and a big conference room where Harcourt&#x27;s drug deal was taking place were built on stages at the film studio. A Van Nuys bus stop set stood in as the taco burrito stand for the amusing scene between Francisco and Sykes relating to raw fast food. Some of the stunt scenes involving an action sequence later in the film was shot at a harbor in San Pedro. For certain scenes within that shot, the production crew built their own custom water tank 44 feet in length and 22 feet in width. Two submerged 75 horsepower motors churned to create artificial waves, while separate raised wind machines worked to create the effect of a helicopter hovering over water. Other practical filming locations included Nichols Canyon Beach, the Los Angeles Police Academy and the York Street police station for interiors. A bar called &quot;Monty&#x27;s&quot; in downtown Los Angeles was used for a scene involving the rough alien played by Brian Thompson. The interior of Sykes&#x27;s house was filmed at a home near the studio, while a location in Beverly Glen stood in for a church in the final wedding scene. Some of the more elaborate sets used extensively in the film, were the Millennium Biltmore Hotel and an Anheuser–Busch plant. The alien villain Harcourt, is introduced at the hotel in the elite Crystal Room. The lobby section of the hotel with its very high ceilings and extensive complement of gold motif, was used in an interview scene between the characters of Harcourt, Kipling and the detectives. Alternatively, the beverage plant was used as a disguise for a petroleum factory. Unused portions of the facility containing steel tanks were used as an interesting gloomy background. A methane lab was recreated with translucent tubes running through them, as though drugs were in the process of being refined. Certain visual smoke effects were also created to copy the look of an oil refinery.

As scripted by writer Rockne S. O&#x27;Bannon, &quot;Alien Nation&quot; was originally called, &quot;Future Tense&quot;. The film took some of its concept from the TV series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, &quot;Outer Heat&quot;, which essentially was an amalgam of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; and a 1960s science fiction TV series, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a &quot;space epic&quot; but more of an action film. He admitted, &quot;We did build a spaceship, but it&#x27;s a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background but not a lot of detail...&quot; Collis noted that the film was even &quot;reminiscent of the work I did in &quot;Cocoon&quot;.&quot; An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin&#x27;s original name for his character was set to be &quot;George Jetson&quot;. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn&#x27;t allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, &quot;I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name &quot;couldn&#x27;t&quot; be used.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy&#x27;s name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie&#x27;s whole idea. It&#x27;s a great loss to the piece that we couldn&#x27;t recover, a great misfortune that couldn&#x27;t be solved. It would have helped a lot.&quot; In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name &quot;George&quot; as a substitute. Patinkin added, &quot;Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but &quot;Jetson&quot;. So in our minds, he&#x27;s George Jetson. So as far as I&#x27;m concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they&#x27;re watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him.&quot; To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said &quot;It&#x27;s one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very proud of the fact that he&#x27;s able to be a cop.&quot; In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, &quot;Why would you bring up that?&quot; before stating, &quot;Yeah, well, I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t have too many ... [Hesitates.] I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But ... I don&#x27;t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn&#x27;t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but ... it was just one of those things where, you know, you don&#x27;t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn&#x27;t one of ... I wouldn&#x27;t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular.&quot;

===Cinematography===
Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose previous film credits included &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, &quot;La Bamba&quot; and &quot;Near Dark&quot;, approached the film with a unique documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, &quot;The first ones were a disaster. They didn&#x27;t look good at all. I didn&#x27;t know how to photograph these aliens. It was the first time I had to deal with this kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests.&quot; At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, &quot;I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn&#x27;t going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn&#x27;t let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn&#x27;t believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful.&quot;

On character interactions, Greenberg noted how there was &quot;a lot of dialogue between Jimmy and Mandy in the car. We used a lot of car mounts. I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you could see all the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper.&quot; The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting to identify the aliens with a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, &quot;We ended up with very deep, strong blue – a sort of moonlight blue. We tried to do all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places.&quot; Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, &quot;I figured out from tests that it is better for me to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. I can control the contrast with light, but I have to live with the grain.&quot; Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, &quot;Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras.&quot;

Lighting challenges were abound for Greenberg as most of the film took place at night. One of the simplest techniques for lighting employed by Greenberg was using a car&#x27;s headlights to dramatically produce a scene of terror. Greenberg explained, &quot;We had a scene on Zuma Beach where the bad guys are dragging somebody into the ocean. I wanted to have a very hard, but very natural, and strong look. So, I used the car headlights. It was nice because everything behind the villains fell into darkness. It had a surrealistic look.&quot; Greenberg also remarked how he had a close working relationship with DeLuxe lab in getting the correct color for the extensive night shooting in the film by bluntly saying, &quot;In a movie like this I wanted the blacks to be very black, so I worked closely with DeLuxe lab...&quot; He felt the daily challenges of night shooting visibly enhanced the appeal of &quot;Alien Nation&quot; by figuratively mentioning, &quot;as a cameraman, you can create a lot more at night. Sometimes you have to feel your way. You also have true control at night. If a light is on it is because you turned it on.&quot;

===Music and soundtrack===
The score for the film was originally composed by Jerry Goldsmith, but later rejected in favor of music composed by Curt Sobel. Goldsmith&#x27;s score was however used for the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer. Musical artists Smokey Robinson, The Beach Boys, Michael Bolton, Mick Jagger and David Bowie among others, contributed songs which appear in the film. At the end of the film the theme song &quot;Indestructible&quot; for the characters of Sykes and Francisco was featured by The Four Tops. The audio soundtrack in Compact Disc format composed by Sobel was never officially released, but a limited edition of the original score initially composed by Goldsmith featuring 18 tracks, was released in 2005. The score was entirely synthesized and limited to 3,000 copies. The melody featured throughout the film recorded by Goldsmith, was originally composed for the movie &quot;Wall Street&quot;. After being rejected for both that film project and later &quot;Alien Nation&quot;, the score was used in the 1990 film &quot;The Russia House&quot;. The sound effects in the film were supervised by Mark Mangini. The mixing of the sound elements were orchestrated by David MacMillan and Charles Wilborn.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reported that 53% of 32 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.4 out of 10. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average out of 100 to critics&#x27; reviews, &quot;Alien Nation&quot; was given a score of 45 based on 10 reviews.

Among critics, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun Times&quot;, gave the film two stars in a mostly negative review, saying the film lacked a science fiction theme and was more akin to a police murder revenge flick, musing &quot;they&#x27;ve just taken the standard cop-buddy-drug lord routine and changed some of the makeup. The Newcomers have no surprises.&quot; Regarding the fictional alien culture, he expressed disappointment saying &quot;a feeble attempt is made to invest the Newcomers with interest, by having them get drunk on sour milk instead of booze, and depriving them of any sense of humor.&quot; However, on a slightly complimentary note, Ebert mentioned &quot;the makeup took trouble, the photography looks good, the cast and technical credits are top-drawer.&quot; But overall, he summed it up by declaring &quot;&quot;Alien Nation&quot; feels like a movie made by people who have seen a lot of movies, but don&#x27;t think the audience has.&quot; In agreement with Ebert over the originality of the buddy cop genre with the aliens inserted in as just a new rendition, Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Alien Nation&quot; wants to be &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; as science fiction, but it&#x27;s neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It&#x27;s too dull for one and too dumb for the other.&quot; Kempley did find the first half hour to be suspenseful, though: &quot;...well paced, brawny and intense, looks like it was made by another director. But the rest is the cinematic equivalent of overcooked asparagus.&quot; However, the more enthusiastic staff of &quot;Variety&quot; found originality in the extraterrestrial–injected plot, saying, &quot;Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases&quot; while also adding the film was a &quot;compelling humanhumanoid drama.&quot;

Another positive review centering on the science fiction elements of the film was relayed by Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She praised the theme, saying, &quot;&quot;Alien Nation&quot; has the best science-fiction idea this side of &quot;The Terminator&quot;.&quot; However, Maslin was quick to admit the film &quot;settles down, with remarkable ease, into the routine of a two-cop buddy film, extraterrestrials and all. Matthew and Sam (whom Matthew refuses to address that way, renaming him George) go through all the familiar stages of forging a friendship between partners: cool antipathy, exchanges of insults, growing mutual respect on the job and, finally, an all-night drinking binge to solidify their buddyhood.&quot; On a negative front, author Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; commented on James Caan&#x27;s performance, viewing him as &quot;Looking like a Paul Newman gone wrong...&quot; He went on, further stating that &quot;the film&#x27;s air of enlightenment is only makeup deep. And while &quot;Alien Nation&quot; is no smarter than, say, a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;, it hasn&#x27;t got the juice or the level of sensory jolt a &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; supplies.&quot; Other critics such as Gene Siskel acknowledged the similarities between other police thriller movies, but still found the film to be a &quot;Genuinely entertaining version of that old reliable; a cop buddy picture with two very different detectives.&quot; He explained, &quot;Now this is an example of how you can put a nice twist on a familiar story, and it will work if it&#x27;s been fully written. Caan and Patinkin have special characters to play.&quot; Compelled by the acting, he felt &quot;The buddy combination here worked for me.&quot; He ultimately gave the film a &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; review. Not nearly as impressed with the film was author NF of &quot;TimeOut Magazine&quot;, calling it &quot;worthy, predictable, and dull.&quot; A summation of the negativity was, &quot;Played hard and fast, the film might just have worked, but the decision to soft-pedal the violence merely emphasizes the obviousness of the liberal point-scoring (parallels with Vietnamese or Nicaraguan refugees are so facile as to be crass).&quot; Critic Leonard Maltin referred to the film as &quot;a great concept that doesn&#x27;t quite pay off.&quot; But in a hint of commendation, he remarked how the film contains &quot;many clever touches and terrific performances by Caan and Patinkin.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film of 1988, and received two Saturn nominations for Best Supporting Actor for Mandy Patinkin as well as Best Make-Up for John M. Elliott Jr. and Stan Winston. The film also received two other nominations, among them for Best Dramatic Presentation from the Hugo Awards and Best Film for Graham Baker from the Fantasporto International Fantasy Film Awards.

==In other media==
===TV series===
The following year after the film&#x27;s release, the extraterrestrial plot concept was used as the basis for a television series of the same name. The show attempted to move away from the original film&#x27;s &quot;Buddy Cop&quot; premise, and delve more into the aliens&#x27; distinct culture and characteristics. Premiering on September 18, 1989, the series aired 22 episodes and ran for a single season, ending on May 7, 1990. Gary Graham played the lead role of Matt Sikes, while Eric Pierpoint was chosen to play the character of the Tenctonese newcomer George Francisco. Supporting acting roles were played by Michele Scarabelli, Lauren Woodland and Sean Six. Contributing directors to various episodes included Harry Longstreet, Stan Lathan, Lyndon Chubbuck and Kenneth Johnson. Writing credits were assigned to Steve Mitchell, Kenneth Van Sickle and Kenneth Johnson among others.

===TV films===
Following the demise of the television series in 1990, plans were devised to continue the popularity of the concept surrounding the race of the Newcomers through a string of television films. Premiering on October 25, 1994, the first of five sequels entitled &quot;Alien Nation: Dark Horizon&quot;, was released with a plot surrounding a distinct Newcomer arriving on Earth attempting to lure the aliens back into a life of slavery. The film was written on a screenplay conceived by Andrew Schneider and Diane Frolov. &quot;Alien Nation: Body and Soul&quot; followed on October 10, 1995, with a story revolving around a slaveship medical experiment involving a child who appears to be part human and part Newcomer. A side plot also involves the character of Sikes and a female Tenctonese exploring a relationship. Harry and Renee Longstreet were credited writers for the storyline. The franchise saw two more sequels in 1996. &quot;Alien Nation: Millennium&quot; was released on January 2, 1996, and dealt with a mysterious cult that uses mind-altering alien artifacts to lure Newcomer followers into a doomsday scenario. The film&#x27;s plot was a tie-in to one of the television episodes titled: &quot;Generation to Generation&quot; that premiered on January 29, 1990. &quot;Alien Nation: The Enemy Within&quot; was aired on November 12, 1996, and revolved around a story from which the detectives try to save their city from an alien threat originating from a waste disposal facility. Racism was a key theme encountered by the character of Francisco. The fifth and final sequel appeared on July 29, 1997. &quot;Alien Nation: The Udara Legacy&quot;, finds the detectives trying to stop a resistance group among the Newcomers trying to indoctrinate those among them into causing mayhem. A side plot involved the younger Newcomer &quot;Buck&quot;, played by actor Sean Six, enlisting to become a police officer. All the sequels in the series were directed by producer Kenneth Johnson.

===Comics===
Between 1990 and 1992, Malibu Comics printed several comics adaptations.

===Books===

In 1993, Pocket Books, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, published a novel series, including the Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens&#x27; &quot;Day of Descent&quot;, Peter David&#x27;s &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, along with Barry B. Longyear&#x27;s &quot;The Change&quot; and &quot;Slag Like Me&quot;.

==Remake==
On March 25, 2015, Fox announced a remake with Art Marcum and Matt Holloway writing. On September 9, 2016, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Jeff Nichols will write and direct the film. However, the film was later put on hold. On January 25, 2021, it was announced that Nichols would remake the film as a ten-part television series.

<text>KFI (640 AM) is a radio station in Los Angeles, California, owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc. It began operations in 1922 and became one of the first high-powered, clear-channel Class A stations. It was the first U.S. station west of Chicago to broadcast at 50,000 watts.

Studios and offices are in Burbank, between the Warner Bros. Studios and The Burbank Studios. The transmitter site is in La Mirada near the Artesia Boulevard exit of Interstate 5, the Santa Ana Freeway. By day, its signal can be heard throughout Southern California, with city-grade coverage as far as San Diego, Santa Barbara and Tijuana, and secondary coverage as far as Bakersfield and northwestern Mexico, and at times can be heard some distance into Nevada and Arizona. At night, it can be heard across much of the western half of North America.

KFI and KNX (AM 1070 and 97.1 FM) serve as the primary entry points for the Southern California Emergency Alert System, which are responsible for activation of the EAS when hazardous weather alerts, disaster area declarations, and child abductions are issued.

KFI is licensed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to broadcast in the HD (hybrid) format; however, it was reported that KFI turned off its HD signal as of August 12, 2015. Like other stations owned by iHeartMedia, KFI uses iHeartRadio to stream its webcast.

==Programming==
KFI is one of two iHeartMedia stations in Los Angeles that carry a talk radio format. KFI features mostly local hosts while KEIB (1150 AM) has a schedule of nationally syndicated talk shows. Morning drive time on KFI has been hosted by Bill Handel since 1993. He is followed by Gary Hoffmann and Shannon Farren in middays, John and Ken in early afternoons, Tim Conway, Jr. (son of comedian Tim Conway) in late afternoons and Mo&#x27; Kelly in the evening. One syndicated show is heard overnight, &quot;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot;. Two Los Angeles TV stations do live segments with cameras in KFI&#x27;s studios: KTTV (Bill Handel) and KTLA (John and Ken).

Weekends feature specialty shows, some of which are nationally syndicated from KFI: &quot;Handel on the Law with Bill Handel, Rich DeMuro on Tech&quot; and &quot;The Jesus Christ Show with Neil Saavedra&quot;. Other weekend shows focus on money, psychology, food, home repair and unsolved crimes. KFI has news and traffic updates every 15 minutes and is an affiliate of ABC News Radio.

==History==
===Earle C. Anthony===
Effective December 1, 1921, the U.S. government adopted regulations formally defining &quot;broadcasting stations&quot;. The wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) was designated for entertainment broadcasts, while 485 meters (619 kHz) was reserved for broadcasting official weather and other government reports.

KFI was first licensed on March 31, 1922. It was owned by Earle C. Anthony, Inc. It operated on the 360-meter entertainment wavelength. The KFI call letters were randomly assigned from a roster of available call signs.

The station made its debut broadcast on April 16, 1922. It featured vaudeville performers Eugene and Willie Howard. Earle Anthony had trained as an electrical engineer and in 1903, founded the California Pelican, UC Berkeley″s first humor magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;berkeley/anthony-hall&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was best known as the owner of a Packard automobile dealership.

KFI was originally located at Anthony&#x27;s home, using a 50-watt transmitter Anthony had personally constructed on a kitchen table.&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oldradio/LA/nw4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;earthsignals/Newcomb/WALK&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared time===
1922 saw a rapid expansion in the number of broadcasting stations, most sharing the single entertainment wavelength of 360 meters, which required progressively more complicated time sharing schedules among stations in the same region. In mid-May 1922, KFI was assigned 1:45 to 2:30 and 4:30 to 5:00 p.m. weekdays. An August 1922 schedule reported that KFI was conducting broadcasts, in conjunction with the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, on both the 360-meter &quot;entertainment&quot; wavelength (daily from 1:45-2:15 p.m, with additional hours of Tuesday, 9 to 10 p.m; Wednesday, 6 to 7 p.m; Friday 9 to 10 p.m.; Saturday, 6 to 7 p.m., and Sunday 10:45 to 11:30 a.m. plus 4 to 5 p.m.), and on 510 meters (588 kHz) on Sunday from 7 to 9 p.m. A regional schedule adopted November 1, 1922, listed KFI&#x27;s slots as 1:00 to 1:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday, 2:00 to 3:00 p.m Tuesday and Saturday, 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 4:00 to 5:00 p.m. Sunday, and 9:20 to 10:00 p.m daily.
Anthony moved quickly to expand operations. The station&#x27;s studios and transmitter were moved to the top of the Packard dealership building, formerly located at Tenth and Hope Streets in Los Angeles, with a rooftop &quot;T&quot; antenna mounted between two short towers. This installation reportedly cost $30,000, and included a 500-watt Western Electric transmitter, the most powerful commercially available transmitter at this time. This new facility went into operation on January 27, 1923. In September 1922 the Department of Commerce set aside a second entertainment wavelength, 400 meters (750 kHz) for &quot;Class B&quot; stations that had quality equipment and programming, and KFI was assigned to this more exclusive wavelength, joining KHJ on a timesharing basis. In May 1923 additional &quot;Class B&quot; frequencies were made available, with Los Angeles allocated 640 and 760 kHz, and KFI was reassigned to 640 kHz, with KHJ moving to 760 kHz.

From 1922 to 1926, early programming consisted of such things as reading news from a newspaper and local gossip. Broadcasting hours were very short, since Anthony was involved in many other activities, and programming sources were limited. However, Anthony stressed the need for quality programming that would be in keeping with his status as the seller of luxury automobiles.

===Expanded programming and higher power===

In November 1926, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) was incorporated. When NBC&#x27;s network facilities were extended to the west coast of the United States, KFI immediately became one of its affiliates. In joining this network, KFI had the advantage of NBC&#x27;s vast entertainment and news resources. One of the first NBC programs to originate on the West Coast, and KFI, was the broadcast of the 1927 Rose Bowl Game from Pasadena, California, with announcer Graham McNamee.

On November 11, 1928, the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s (FRC) General Order 40 divided transmitting frequencies into &quot;clear&quot;, &quot;regional&quot; and &quot;local&quot; classifications. 640 kHz was now classified as a &quot;clear channel&quot;, and KFI remained on this frequency, now designated as its dominant station. KFI was allowed to operate with a non-directional antenna at the highest allowable power of 50,000 watts, while other stations on the frequency were required to protect KFI&#x27;s signal from interference.

NBC operated two radio networks, the Red Network and the Blue Network. The Red Network carried sponsored commercial programs, while the Blue Network carried the sustaining ones where the network sold individual commercials within the shows. In 1931, NBC reorganized its West Coast operations, creating regional Orange and Blue networks that replaced its previous Pacific Coast network. KFI was part of the Orange group, along with KGO in Oakland, KGW in Portland, KOMO in Seattle, and KHQ in Spokane.

===50,000 watts===
In July 1931, KFI increased its transmitter power from 5,000 to 50,000 watts, becoming the first U.S. station west of Chicago to broadcast with that power. A special 4-hour program was aired, featuring congratulatory speeches by NBC West Coast vice president and others, joined by entertainers from New York and Chicago on a coast-to-coast live hookup. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Los Angeles mayor John Clinton Porter was comically effusive in his praise.

NBC&#x27;s, and KFI&#x27;s, programming expanded in 1930s and 1940s. The NBC radio network was owned by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which also owned the Keith–Albee–Orpheum vaudeville circuit, later renamed Radio–Keith–Orpheum (RKO). RKO handled many vaudeville comedians and singers, including Jack Benny, Burns and Allen, Fred Allen, Eddie Cantor, and Rudy Vallee, whose programs were highly rated. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many people could not afford movie tickets, but they could purchase a radio where they could listen to commercially sponsored entertainment for free. During its early days, KFI carried such sporting events as the World Series and the Rose Bowl. Although KFI&#x27;s call letters were randomly assigned, many people assumed that the &quot;FI&quot; stood for &quot;Farmers Information&quot;. Every winter evening from 1924 to 1956, KFI delivered a frost report at 8 p.m. telling citrus farmers whether to turn on wind machines or light &quot;smudge pots&quot; to keep their orange and lemon groves from freezing. The frost warnings moved to 7 p.m. until the late 1970s when they were removed from the schedule.

From 1929 to 1944, Earle Anthony also owned KECA, now KABC. KFI was an affiliate of the NBC Red Network, while KECA carried programming from the Blue Network. However, in August 1941 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a &quot;duopoly&quot; rule, which restricted licensees from operating more than one radio station in a given market. Therefore, Anthony sold KECA in 1944 to the Blue Network for $800,000. (In 1942, under the provisions of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, NBC had been required to divest itself of its Blue Network, which later became the Blue Network Incorporated, and subsequently the American Broadcasting Company.)

===World War II===
During World War II, KFI was a prime source for war news in the Los Angeles area. It was feared that an attack on the west coast of the United States was possible, and people were warned to turn off lights and drape black cloths over windows, so that enemy bombers would not see identifying landmarks. Periodically, KFI and the other Los Angeles radio stations signed off so that any hostile aircraft could not use their signals as a guide for bombing attacks, which had been the case in the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.

On November 29, 1944, KFI officials broke ground on Mount Wilson for construction of a new FM and TV facility. The ceremony was broadcast from noon to 12:15 p.m. over KFI. KFI-FM began broadcasting with its first test program on 105.9 MHz in July 1946, although other sources say the station went on the air in 1947. KFI-FM only lasted until 1951, when Earle C. Anthony decided to end operations and returned the station license to the FCC for cancellation. That same year KFI-TV was sold to the General Tire and Rubber Company. This station is now KCAL-TV.

===Full service radio format===
In the 1950s, sponsors began a gradual migration from radio to television, reducing radio advertising revenue, and less money became available for quality radio network entertainment programming. NBC and the other radio networks began dropping large-budget entertainment shows in favor of news and information programming. &quot;NBC News on the Hour&quot; and &quot;Emphasis&quot; became the network staples as entertainment programs were slowly phased out.

NBC radio affiliates like KFI had to decide whether to reduce or eliminate their network connections in order to maintain profits. KFI began using disc jockeys playing phonograph records. KFI programming transitioned during this period from block programming, often featuring 15-minute shows, to a full service middle of the road format. Popular disk jockeys played records and chatted about local events, interspersed with aggressive local news and sports coverage. The station also carried &quot;Monitor&quot;, the NBC network&#x27;s weekend radio service.

In the 1980s, as FM replaced AM radio as the primary source for contemporary music, KFI became a news and information outlet.

KFI was the flagship station for the Los Angeles Chargers professional football team during its inaugural year in the American Football League in 1960, when the team was based in Los Angeles, before spending the next five decades in San Diego. From 1960 to 1973, the station was the radio flagship station of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. KFI aired all the games as well as feeding the play-by-play broadcasts to other stations in the Southwest.

KFI&#x27;s founder, Earle C. Anthony, died on August 6, 1961. In April 1972, KFI celebrated its 50th birthday. Festivities included a 12-hour special, featuring interviews and commentaries from many former NBC Radio personalities.

===Cox Broadcasting ownership===
In 1973, Cox Broadcasting, headquartered in Atlanta, purchased KFI for $15 million, which at the time was the highest amount paid for a radio station. James Wesley, Cox&#x27;s general manager at WIOD in Miami, and that station&#x27;s operations manager, Elliott &quot;Biggie&quot; Nevins, were dispatched to Los Angeles to manage KFI.

Cox instructed Wesley to find an FM station in the Los Angeles market to buy, and a deal was reached with Dallas broadcaster Gordon McLendon to purchase KOST (103.5 FM) for $2.2 million. Wesley also decided against renewing the long term agreement for carrying Dodger baseball, allowing KABC to become the new Dodger radio station in Los Angeles.

===Top 40 format===
Starting in the mid-1970s, KFI switched to top 40 music. Cox Broadcasting hired John Rook as program director. Rook was considered the force behind the success of WLS in Chicago. One of his first hires was Dave Sebastian (Williams), formerly of KHJ, as music director and air personality. Rook&#x27;s first air staff included &quot;The Lohman and Barkley Show&quot; with Al Lohman and Roger Barkley (top-rated in the morning), Mark Taylor (midday), Bob Shannon (afternoon drive time) and music director Dave Sebastian (evenings). Within the first year Dave left abruptly for crosstown Top 40 competitor KTNQ (1020 AM; Ten-Q). John Rook then moved in Eric Chase (midday), Charlie Fox (early evening) and Dave Diamond (late night). KFI shot to #1 in the ratings, at some points being the most listened-to Top 40 station in the nation at 50,000 watts.

By the late 1970s the staff was revised to Lohman &amp; Barkley mornings, Tim &amp; Ev Kelly in middays, Jack Armstrong afternoons, Big Ron O&#x27;Brien evenings and Charlie Fox at night.

===Personality radio format===
Rook and several of the on air personalities left in the early 1980s. At that point, KFI began softening its playlist to adult top 40 (in between top 40 and adult contemporary). By the mid-1980s the station was more news and personality driven than music intensive with a full service format.

In the 1970s and &#x27;80s, the station featured a hybrid format combining adult contemporary music with comedian hosts. In addition to Lohman and Barkley, other hosts included Hudson &amp; Landry, Charlie and Mitzi (Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall of &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In),&quot; and Gary Owens. In winter 1984, KFI began broadcasting in AM stereo, with the Motorola C-QUAM system. The stereo broadcasts ended in January 2000.

===Transition to talk format===
By the mid-1980s ratings began to slip, as music listening switched to the FM band. In the spring of 1984, KFI was ranked 28th in the Los Angeles Arbitron ratings, ahead of only KHJ among the market&#x27;s AM music stations. KFI moved the music to more of a soft gold-based AC and began to play less of it. The talk shows moved from a blend of entertainment, comedy, and lifestyle to more political issues.

Writer/Producer John Thomas was assigned to Lohman &amp; Barkley in 1984 and helped raise their ratings for the morning show to a tie for #1 in the 25-54 demographic in Fall 1985. Shortly after Thomas left KFI for WLS in Chicago the morning show fell apart. Barkley split off from the morning show to go to KABC.

The music was dropped in 1988 as KFI evolved to an issues-oriented talk format. The first hosts were psychologist Dr. Toni Grant, TV game show host Geoff Edwards and Tom Leykis hosted a politically oriented &quot;combat radio&quot; program.
Competitor KABC, which had been doing talk radio for some time, sued KFI in U.S. District Court to have KFI cease and desist using the term &quot;Talk Radio&quot; with the call letters. Therefore, the slogan &quot;More Stimulating Talk Radio&quot; was created. Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s nationally syndicated conservative talk show replaced Edwards in 1988 after Edwards refused to play promotional spots for the controversial Leykis show.

===iHeartMedia ownership===
In 1999, Chancellor Media traded 13 stations to Cox to acquire KFI and KOST. Cox opted to exit the Los Angeles market and focus on medium radio markets and its TV stations.

Chancellor merged with Capstar in 1999 and became known as AMFM Inc. In 2000, AMFM merged with Clear Channel Communications making KFI Clear Channel&#x27;s top AM radio station in Los Angeles. In 2014, Clear Channel changed its corporate name to iHeartMedia to identify its radio stations with its iHeartRadio internet streaming platform. The station license continued to be held by a subsidiary of Capstar.

On the day of the 9/11 attacks, Bill Handel remained on air for seven consecutive hours. Handel hosted his morning show from 5-9 am, then continuted hosting from 9-noon as an emergency fill-in on the syndicated Rush Limbaugh show. Limbaugh was scheduled to be off that day, but his planned fill-in host could not broadcast from New York due to communication problems in the city. Handel&#x27;s broadcast was also carried on the other Clear Channel stations in Los Angeles.

In summer 2004, KFI became the most listened to talk radio station in the United States, beating New York City&#x27;s WABC in cumulative audience during the rating period. That year KFI was named the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; &quot;News &amp; Talk Radio Station of the Year&quot;.

The syndicated &quot;Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; was heard on KFI from July 4, 1988, to January 20, 2014, when it moved to sister station KEIB.

On August 10, 2015, KFI began a simulcast on KOST&#x27;s HD 2 signal.

KFI served as the flagship station of the Los Angeles Chargers, carrying all of the team&#x27;s game day broadcasts from the team&#x27;s return to the Los Angeles market in 2017 until 2020, when games were moved to co-owned 98.7 KYSR.

===Federal Election Commission complaint===
In recent years, especially since the 2003 recall of the Governor of California, afternoon drive hosts John and Ken have become actively involved in several political causes, most notably that of illegal immigration. In the months leading up to the 2004 election, the hosts instigated several political rallies advocating the defeat of Congressmen David Dreier (a Republican) and Joe Baca (a Democrat), both of whom they felt were wrongly supportive of illegal immigration.

As a result, the &quot;John and Ken Show&quot; was the subject of a Federal Election Commission complaint filed by the Republican National Committee, alleging that John and Ken engaged in an illegal campaign against Congressman Dreier. The &quot;Political Human Sacrifice&quot; campaign, as they dubbed it, was not successful, since both Dreier and Baca were re-elected, albeit Dreier by a substantially smaller percentage than in past terms. On March 16, 2006, the complaint was dismissed.

==Transmitter site==

The main transmitter was eventually relocated from Anthony&#x27;s Packard dealership to its present location in La Mirada, California, where a &quot;T&quot; antenna was erected between two medium height towers, and the studios of the KFI and its sister station, KECA, were moved to 610 South Ardmore Avenue. The 610 South Ardmore Avenue building is now gone, replaced by a parking lot. (The Packard dealership site was retained as an emergency transmitter for many years, but powered by a 5,000 watt transmitter.)

In 1948, the &quot;T&quot; antenna was replaced by a vertical tower and a emergency vertical tower, as long before vertical antennas had been determined to be superior to &quot;T&quot; antennas for high-powered stations, although 195 degrees (which would be on 640 kHz) would have been optimum. Competitor KNX employs just such a 195 degree tower, as do many other U.S. Class A non-directional stations, and even some Class B non-directional stations. KFI was relatively late to convert from a horizontal to a vertical antenna: same-market Class A KNX converted to a vertical in 1938, and same-state Class As KGO and KPO (now KNBR) converted to verticals in 1941 and 1949, respectively.

There is an unpatched bullet hole in the ceiling of the transmitter building, where a National Guardsman accidentally discharged a rifle during World War II on December 10, 1941. The bullet hole has been preserved as a monument to KFI&#x27;s wartime service.

===2004 tower collapse===
On Sunday, December 19, 2004, at 9:45 a.m., Jim and Mary Ghosoph were killed when their rented Cessna 182P single engine airplane, traveling from the El Monte Airport to Fullerton Municipal Airport, struck KFI&#x27;s transmission tower. The solid steel truss, originally built in 1948, collapsed upon itself, mostly landing in a parking lot to the north of the site. KFI&#x27;s signal was knocked off the air for approximately one hour.

The Ghosophs had taken off from the El Monte Airport with a planned stop at the Fullerton Airport to pick up two passengers. From there, the plan was to fly to the island of Catalina to spend the day, after which they would make the return route to Fullerton and then to El Monte. Pilots had complained for years to KFI management that it needed to put strobe lights on the tower and highly reflective balls on the guy wire. KFI and Clear Channel Communications management responded by saying the tower was in compliance with FCC and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and that it did not need to make any changes.

Until a replacement was erected, the station transmitted from the auxiliary tower at a power of 25,000 watts, but provisions had been made to transmit from the disused KRKD (KIIS) 1150 AM site just north of downtown Los Angeles, whenever the RF field towards the tower erection crew would exceed safety limits. Work was conducted at the site on November 19, 2006, temporarily interrupting a broadcast of Leo Laporte&#x27;s talk show KFI Tech Guy at 11:55 a.m.

===2008 replacement tower collapse===
At 2:30 p.m. on March 18, 2008, the replacement tower collapsed while under construction. The tower was about tall (the final height was to be when a guy wire support failed, causing the tower to tip over in the opposite direction. There were no major injuries, and only limited collateral damage.

The reason for the failure is assumed to be a combination of factors, including the much higher per unit weight of the new cross-section tower, compared to the 1948 tower which had a cross-section, and the inadequacy of the 1948 pier and guy wire terminations, one of which had previously been modified to a cantilever design to facilitate the passage of vehicles under that termination (and, it was the cantilever termination which catastrophically failed during this erection attempt). All of these structural components were replaced or strengthened in preparation for erection of the third tower, which is identical in design to the (failed) replacement tower.

===Third tower construction===

A new tower began construction at the end of July 2008 and was completed on August 14, 2008, by Eli the Construction Guy (structural engineer). It has a top-loading &quot;capacitance hat&quot;, which electrically extends the tower&#x27;s height another , effectively, without actually needing more tower sections. The tower was also equipped with high intensity strobe lights due to its proximity to the Fullerton Municipal Airport, and additional safety upgrades because of the previous plane crash. It has torque arms which limit the twisting of the tower in high winds. (Local regulation authorities in apparent defiance of electrical engineering principles, and communications law, demanded &quot;a 10 percent reduction in overall height&quot;, otherwise the necessary permits would be refused, not withstanding the federal government&#x27;s primary authority over radio communications, and KFI&#x27;s strategic role as an Emergency Alert System station for the western U.S. region).

The station returned to full 50,000 watt power on September 25, 2008, at 5:00 p.m. The tower has been dedicated to the memory of John Paoli, KFI Chief Engineer from 2000 to 2008, who died suddenly from a previously unknown genetic heart condition soon after overseeing the construction of the new tower. A plaque bearing the words &quot;John A. Paoli, 1958-2008, Memorial Tower. Dedicated on this day, November 18, 2008 to our friend and colleague whose passion and talent brought KFI AM 640 to millions of listeners.&quot; and his likeness now graces the wall around the tower&#x27;s base.

<doc id="574917" wikidata="Q21108636" url="?curid=574917" title="Autocrine signaling">
<text>Autocrine signaling is a form of cell signaling in which a cell secretes a hormone or chemical messenger (called the autocrine agent) that binds to autocrine receptors on that same cell, leading to changes in the cell. This can be contrasted with paracrine signaling, intracrine signaling, or classical endocrine signaling.

==Examples==
An example of an autocrine agent is the cytokine interleukin-1 in monocytes. When interleukin-1 is produced in response to external stimuli, it can bind to cell-surface receptors on the same cell that produced it.

Another example occurs in activated T cell lymphocytes, i.e., when a T cell is induced to mature by binding to a peptide:MHC complex on a professional antigen-presenting cell and by the B7:CD28 costimulatory signal. Upon activation, &quot;low-affinity&quot; IL-2 receptors are replaced by &quot;high-affinity&quot; IL-2 receptors consisting of α, β, and γ chains. The cell then releases IL-2, which binds to its own new IL-2 receptors, causing self-stimulation and ultimately a monoclonal population of T cells. These T cells can then go on to perform effector functions such as macrophage activation, B cell activation, and cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

==Cancer==

Tumor development is a complex process that requires cell division, growth, and survival. One approach used by tumors to upregulate growth and survival is through autocrine production of growth and survival factors. Autocrine signaling plays critical roles in cancer activation and also in providing self-sustaining growth signals to tumors.

===In the Wnt pathway===

Normally, the Wnt signaling pathway leads to stabilization of β-catenin through inactivation of a protein complex containing the tumor suppressors APC and Axin. This destruction complex normally triggers β-catenin phosphorylation, inducing its degradation. De-regulation of the autocrine Wnt signaling pathway via mutations in APC and Axin have been linked to activation of various types of human cancer. Genetic alterations that lead to de-regulation of the autocrine Wnt pathway result in transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other pathways, in turn contributing to proliferation of tumor cells. In colorectal cancer, for example, mutations in APC, axin, or β-catenin promote β-catenin stabilization and transcription of genes encoding cancer-associated proteins. Furthermore, in human breast cancer, interference with the de-regulated Wnt signaling pathway reduces proliferation and survival of cancer. These findings suggest that interference with Wnt signaling at the ligand-receptor level may improve the effectiveness of cancer therapies.

===IL-6===

Interleukin 6 (acronym: IL-6) is a cytokine that is important for many aspects of cellular biology including immune responses, cell survival, apoptosis, as well as proliferation. Several studies have outlined the importance of autocrine IL-6 signaling in lung and breast cancers. For example, one group found a positive correlation between persistently activated tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), found in 50% of lung adenocarcinomas, and IL-6. Further investigation revealed that mutant EGFR could activate the oncogenic STAT3 pathway via upregulated IL-6 autocrine signaling.

Similarly, HER2 overexpression occurs in approximately a quarter of breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. Recent research revealed that IL-6 secretion induced by HER2 overexpression activated STAT3 and altered gene expression, resulting in an autocrine loop of IL-6/STAT3 expression. Both mouse and human in vivo models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers relied critically on this HER2–IL-6–STAT3 signaling pathway. Another group found that high serum levels of IL-6 correlated with poor outcome in breast cancer tumors. Their research showed that autocrine IL-6 signaling induced malignant features in Notch-3 expressing mammospheres.

===IL-7===

A study demonstrates how the autocrine production of the IL-7 cytokine mediated by T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) can be involved in the oncogenic development of T-ALL and offer novel insights into T-ALL spreading. 

===VEGF===

Another agent involved in autocrine cancer signaling is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF, produced by carcinoma cells, acts through paracrine signaling on endothelial cells and through autocrine signaling on carcinoma cells. Evidence shows that autocrine VEGF is involved in two major aspects of invasive carcinoma: survival and migration. Moreover, it was shown that tumor progression selects for cells that are VEGF-dependent, challenging the belief that VEGF&#x27;s role in cancer is limited to angiogenesis. Instead, this research suggests that VEGF receptor-targeted therapeutics may impair cancer survival and invasion as well as angiogenesis.

===Promotion of metastasis===

Metastasis is a major cause of cancer deaths, and strategies to prevent or halt invasion are lacking. One study showed that autocrine PDGFR signaling plays an essential role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) maintenance in vitro, which is known to correlate well with metastasis in vivo. The authors showed that the metastatic potential of oncogenic mammary epithelial cells required an autocrine PDGF/PDGFR signaling loop, and that cooperation of autocrine PDGFR signaling with oncogenic was required for survival during EMT. Autocrine PDGFR signaling also contributes to maintenance of EMT, possibly through activation of STAT1 and other distinct pathways. In addition, expression of PDGFRα and -β correlated with invasive behavior in human mammary carcinomas. This indicates the numerous pathways through which autocrine signaling can regulate metastatic processes in a tumor.

===Development of therapeutic targets===

The growing knowledge behind the mechanism of autocrine signaling in cancer progression has revealed new approaches for therapeutic treatment. For example, autocrine Wnt signaling could provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention by means of Wnt antagonists or other molecules that interfere with ligand-receptor interactions of the Wnt pathway. In addition, VEGF-A production and VEGFR-2 activation on the surface of breast cancer cells indicates the presence of a distinct autocrine signaling loop that enables breast cancer cells to promote their own growth and survival by phosphorylation and activation of VEGFR-2. This autocrine loop is another example of an attractive therapeutic target.

In HER2 overexpressing breast cancers, the HER2–IL-6–STAT3 signaling relationship could be targeted to develop new therapeutic strategies. HER2 kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib, have also demonstrated clinical efficacy in HER2 overexpressing breast cancers by disrupting a neuregulin-1 (NRG1)-mediated autocrine loop.

In the case of PDGFR signalling, overexpression of a dominant-negative PDGFR or application of the cancer drug STI571 are both approaches being explored to therapeutically interference with metastasis in mice.

In addition, drugs may be developed that activate autocrine signaling in cancer cells that would not otherwise occur. For example, a small-molecule mimetic of Smac/Diablo that counteracts the inhibition of apoptosis has been shown to enhance apoptosis caused by chemotherapeutic drugs through autocrine-secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). In response to autocrine TNFα signaling, the Smac mimetic promotes formation of a RIPK1-dependent caspase-8-activating complex, leading to apoptosis.

===Role in drug resistance===

Recent studies have reported the ability of drug-resistant cancer cells to acquire mitogenic signals from previously neglected autocrine loops, causing tumor recurrence.

For example, despite widespread expression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and EGF family ligands in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib have shown limited therapeutic success. This resistance is proposed to be because autocrine growth signaling pathways distinct from EGFR are active in NSCLC cells. Gene expression profiling revealed the prevalence of specific fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors in NSCLC cell lines, and found that FGF2, FGF9 and their receptors encompass a growth factor autocrine loop that is active in a subset of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell lines.

In breast cancer, the acquisition of tamoxifen resistance is another major therapeutic problem. It has been shown that phosphorylation of STAT3 and RANTES expression are increased in response to tamoxifen in human breast cancer cells. In a recent study, one group showed that STAT3 and RANTES contribute to the maintenance of drug resistance by upregulating anti-apoptotic signals and inhibiting caspase cleavage. These mechanisms of STAT3-RANTES autocrine signaling suggest a novel strategy for management of patients with tamoxifen-resistant tumors.

<text>The RIM-7 Sea Sparrow is a U.S. ship-borne short-range anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapon system, primarily intended for defense against anti-ship missiles. The system was developed in the early 1960s from the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile as a lightweight &quot;point-defense&quot; weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships as quickly as possible, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. In this incarnation, it was a very simple system guided by a manually aimed radar illuminator.

After its introduction, the system underwent significant development into an automated system similar to other US Navy missiles like the RIM-2 Terrier. Contemporary improvements being made to the Sparrow for the air-to-air role led to similar improvements in the Sea Sparrow through the 1970s and 80s. After that point the air-to-air role passed to the AIM-120 AMRAAM and the Sea Sparrow underwent a series of upgrades strictly for the naval role. It now resembles the AIM-7 only in general form; it is larger, faster and includes a new seeker and a launch system suitable for vertical launch from modern warships.

Fifty years after its development, the Sea Sparrow remains an important part of a layered air defense system, providing a short/medium-range component especially useful against sea-skimming missiles.
==History==
=== Background ===
High-speed jet aircraft flying at low altitudes presented a serious threat to naval forces in the late 1950s. Approaching under the local horizon of the ships, the aircraft would suddenly appear at relatively close ranges, giving the ships only seconds to respond before the aircraft dropped their payloads and withdrew. This gave the aircraft an enormous advantage over earlier weapons such as dive bombers or torpedo bombers, whose low speed allowed them to be attacked with some effectiveness by anti-aircraft guns. The advantage was so great that when the Royal Navy was faced by the threat of the new Soviet , they responded in a non-linear fashion by introducing the Blackburn Buccaneer aircraft to attack them.

Further improving the capabilities of aircraft against ships were a variety of precision-guided weapons. Early designs were first used in World War II with manually controlled weapons such as the Fritz X, and evolving into semi-autonomous cruise missiles, such as the Raduga KS-1 Komet, that relied on a combination of initial guidance from the launching aircraft and terminal guidance on the missile itself. These systems allowed the aircraft to launch their attacks from outside the range of shipboard anti-aircraft weapons, in relative safety. Only the presence of defensive fighters operating at long ranges from the ships could provide cover against these attacks, by attacking the launch aircraft before they could close on the ships.

US Navy doctrine stressed long-range air cover to counter both high-speed aircraft and missiles, and development of newer short range defenses had been largely ignored. While the Navy was developing expensive long-range fighters like the Douglas F6D Missileer, most ships were left with older weapons, typically Bofors 40 mm guns or Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. By the early 1960s their capability against modern aircraft and missiles was limited; a lack of fast-reacting mounts, gunsight radars of limited accuracy, and long settling times for the fire control systems all meant that the guns were unlikely to be able to respond effectively against high-speed aircraft.

The introduction of sea-skimming missiles dramatically increased the threat against these ships. Unlike the earlier generation of anti-ship missiles (ASMs), sea-skimmers approached at low level, like an attack aircraft, hiding themselves until the last moment. The missiles were relatively small and much harder to hit than an attacking aircraft. While the older defenses might be considered a credible threat to a large aircraft at low altitude or a missile approaching at higher altitudes, against a sea-skimming missile they were useless. To successfully counter this threat, ships needed new weapons able to attack these targets as soon as they appeared, accurately enough to give them a high first-attempt kill probability - there would be little time for a second attempt.

=== Point defense missile system (PDMS) ===
The US Army faced a similar problem defending against attacks by high-speed jet-powered attack aircraft. In this case the local horizon was generally even more limited, blocked by trees and hills, and engagement times could be measured in seconds. They concluded that a gun-based system was simply unusable in this role; by the time the radar had locked-on and the gunsight calculated proper &quot;lead&quot; there would be no time to shoot at the target while it was within a gun&#x27;s relatively short range. Missiles, on the other hand, could progressively tune their approach while they were flying toward the target, and their proximity fuses meant they only needed to get &quot;close enough&quot;.

In 1959 the Army started development of the MIM-46 Mauler, which mounted a new high-speed missile on top of the ubiquitous M113 Armored Personnel Carrier chassis, along with a medium-range search radar and a separate tracking and illumination radar. In order to deal with the quick response times needed, the fire control system was semi-automatic; operators would view targets on the search radar and prioritize them, the fire control system would select ones within attack range and automatically slew the missiles toward them and launch. Since the missile would be operating close to the ground in highly cluttered environments, it used a combination of beam riding along the illumination radar and an infrared seeker in the nose, which allowed tracking as long as either the path in front or in rear of the missile remained free of obstructions.

These same basic engagement parameters - high-speed and the associated fleeting sighting times - applied to sea-skimming aircraft and missiles as well. The Navy intended to adapt the Mauler to shipboard use by removing its search radar and wiring it into the existing ship-borne radar systems instead. The 9-box launcher and illuminator radar would be retained in a relatively compact mount. Development started in 1960 under the &quot;Point Defense Missile System&quot; (PDMS), the naval version to be known as the &quot;RIM-46A Sea Mauler&quot;. The Navy was so confident in the Sea Mauler that they modified the design of their latest frigates, the , to incorporate a space on the rear deck for the Sea Mauler launcher.

The Navy&#x27;s confidence in Mauler proved misplaced; by 1963 the program had been downgraded to a pure technology development effort due to continued problems, and was canceled outright in 1965. All three of the stakeholders, the US Army, US Navy and British Army, started looking for a replacement. While the British took a longer-term approach and developed the new Rapier missile, the US Army and Navy scrambled to find a system that could be deployed as quickly as possible. Facing the problem of guidance in a cluttered environment, the Army decided to adapt the infrared AIM-9 Sidewinder missile into the MIM-72 Chaparral. This was based on the AIM-9D, a tail-chaser, and would be useless for the Navy where its targets would be approaching head on. They required a radar-guided system, and this naturally led to the AIM-7 Sparrow. They also considered Chaparral for smaller ships due to its much smaller size, but no such fits were ever attempted.

=== Basic point defense missile system (BPDMS) ===
Quickly organizing the &quot;Basic Point Defense Missile System&quot;, BPDMS, the then-current AIM-7E from the F-4 Phantom was adapted to shipboard use with surprising speed. The main developments were the new Mark 25 trainable launcher developed from the ASROC launcher, and the Mark 115 manually aimed radar illuminator that looked like two large searchlights. Operation was extremely simple; the operator would be cued to targets via voice commands from the search radar operators, and he then slewed the illuminator onto the target. The relatively wide beam of the radar only needed to be in the general direction of the target, the continuous wave signal being Doppler shifted by the moving target and showing up strongly even if it was not centered in the beam. The launcher would automatically follow the motions of the illuminator, so that when the missile was fired it would immediately see the signal being reflected off the target.

In this form the Sea Sparrow was tested on the destroyer escort starting in February 1967, but this installation was removed when &quot;Bradley&quot; was sent to Vietnam later that year. Testing continued, and between 1971 and 1975 Sea Sparrow was fitted to 31 ships of the &quot;Knox&quot; class, hulls 1052 to 1069 and 1071 to 1083. The &quot;missing ship&quot; in the series, (DE-1070), was instead used to test an upgraded version (see below).

The Sea Sparrow was far from an ideal weapon. Its rocket engine was designed with the assumption that it would be launched at high speed from an aircraft, and therefore is optimized for a long cruise at relatively low power. In the surface-to-air role one would rather have very high acceleration in order to allow it to intercept sea-skimming targets as soon as possible. The power profile is also suitable for cruising in thin air at high altitudes, but at low altitudes it does not produce enough power to overcome drag and dramatically decreases range; some estimates indicate that the Sea Sparrow may be effective only to , about one quarter of the range of the air-launched Sparrow. An engine of much higher power would greatly improve performance, in spite of a shorter burning time.

Another problem is that the Sparrow is steered with its mid-mounted maneuvering wings. These were used on the Sparrow because they required less energy for basic maneuvers during cruise, but this made the missile less maneuverable overall, which was not well suited to the quick-reaction weapon. Additionally, the powered wings meant that they could not easily be adapted to fold, and therefore the launcher cells were sized to the wings instead of the missile body, taking up much more room than required. Although the Sea Sparrow was meant as a small missile system that could be fit to a wide variety of ships, the launcher was relatively large and was deployed only to larger frigates, destroyers and aircraft carriers. Finally, the manually aimed illuminator was of limited use at night or in bad weather, which was hardly encouraging for a ship-borne weapon where fog was a common occurrence.

=== Improved basic point defense missile system (IBPDMS) ===
In 1968, Denmark, Italy, and Norway signed an agreement with the US Navy to use the Sea Sparrow on their ships, and collaborate on improved versions. Over the next few years a number of other countries joined the NATO SEASPARROW Project Office (NSPO), and today it includes 12 member nations. Under this umbrella group, the &quot;Improved Basic Point Defense Missile System&quot; (IBPDMS) program started even while the original version was being deployed.

IBPDMS emerged as the RIM-7H, which was essentially the RIM-7A with the mid-mounted wings modified to be able to fold. This was done in a fashion similar to carrier-based aircraft; the wings were hinged at a point about 50% along the span, with the outer portions rotated back toward the body of the missile. This allowed them to be stored in tighter container tubes in the new Mark 29 launcher, and flip open automatically when they were released from the tube. The other major change was to allow the seeker to work with a variety of illumination radars, including those being used with existing European missile systems.

Production of the RIM-7H began in 1973 as NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System (NSSMS) Block I. For the US Navy&#x27;s use the new Mark 95 illuminator system was also introduced, similar to the original Mark 115 but with automatic guidance that could be used in any weather. The Mark 95 formed the basis of the highly automated Mark 91 fire control system.

===Missile upgrades===
In 1972 Raytheon started a Sparrow upgrade program to arm the upcoming F-15 Eagle, producing the AIM-7F. The F model replaced the older analog guidance system with a solid state version that could operate with the F-15&#x27;s new pulse-doppler radar. The guidance system was much smaller, which allowed the warhead to be moved from its former rear-mounted position to one in front of the mid-mounted wings, and increased in weight to . Moving it forward also allowed the rocket engine to be enlarged, so it was replaced by a new dual-thrust engine that quickly accelerated the missile to higher speeds, and then settled to a lower thrust for cruise. The new missiles were quickly adapted for the naval role in a fashion similar to the RIM-7H, producing the RIM-7F. The new missile used the lower model designation in spite of the newer technology than the H model.

Another major upgrade to the AIM-7 followed, the AIM-7M. The M included a new monopulse radar seeker that allowed it to be shot downward from a higher-altitude aircraft at a target otherwise masked by the ground. The new model also included a completely computerized guidance system that could be updated in the field, as well as further reducing weight for yet another warhead upgrade. The computerized guidance system also included a simple autopilot that allowed the missile to continue flying toward the last known target location even with the loss of a signal, allowing the launch platform to break lock for short periods while the missile was in flight. All of these modifications also improved performance against low-altitude sea-skimming targets as well. The M model entered US operational service in 1983.

The original RIM-7E was capable to fly at about Mach 2+, between , with a range of (depending on the target height). The RIM-7F enhanced the performances, but also the proximity fuse versus low flying targets, as the minimum altitude was reduced to or less. The RIM-7M was able to strike targets at an altitude of , providing some capability against sea-skimming missiles such the Exocet.

While the M model was being worked on, the US Navy also introduced an upgrade for the Mark 91 fire control system, the &quot;Mark 23 Target Acquisition System&quot; (TAS). TAS included a medium-range 2D radar and IFF system that fed information to a new console in the ship&#x27;s combat information center. The Mark 23 automatically detected, prioritized and displayed potential targets, greatly improving reaction times of the system as a whole. The Mark 23 is also used to select targets for most other weapons systems, including gunfire and other missile systems. TAS started entering the fleet in 1980.
The NSPO also used the M series upgrade as an opportunity to upgrade the system to allow it to be launched from a Vertical Launching System (VLS). This modification uses the &quot;Jet Vane Control&quot; (JVC) package that is added to the bottom of the missile. On launch, a small engine in the JVC boosts the missile up above the launching ship, then uses vanes positioned in its own exhaust to quickly slew the missile into the proper alignment with the target, which is fed to the JVC during launch. As far as the Sea Sparrow is concerned, there is no difference between being launched directly from a trainable launcher or using JVC, in both cases the missile becomes active looking directly at the target.

A final upgrade to the Sparrow was the AIM-7P, which replaced the M&#x27;s guidance system with an improved model that allowed mid-course updates to be sent from the launching platform via new rear-mounted antennas. For air-to-air use this allowed the missile to be &quot;lofted&quot; above the target and then be directed down towards it as it approached; this gives the missile greater range as it spends more time in thinner high-altitude air. In naval use, this meant it could also be directly guided against small surface targets that would otherwise not show up well on radar, allowing the ship&#x27;s more powerful search radars to provide guidance until the missile approached the target and the reflected signal grew stronger. This also gave the Sea Sparrow a very useful secondary anti-shipping role that allows it to attack smaller boats.

=== Ground-launched Sea Sparrow ===

Taiwan operates ground based Sea Sparrows as part of the Skyguard SHORAD system. Five hundred missiles entered service in 1991 and are deployed on trailers with four box launchers. In 2012 they were temporarily withdrawn from service following a pair of missile failures during testing as well as the failure of a related AIM-7 in the same exercises.

In January 2023, the United States announced it would transfer Sea Sparrow missiles to Ukraine as part of a military aid package during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Sea Sparrows are fired from Soviet-era 9K37 Buk missile launchers modified by Ukraine to accept them, to counter attacks from cruise missiles and drones. The system, dubbed &quot;FrankenSAM&quot;, utilizes three different air defense missiles—RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, plus Patriot missiles and Patriot sensor elements—in combination air defense systems based on older Ukrainian tracked vehicles and the Buk missile system. FrankenSAM was confirmed to be in use in December 2023, and was first used successfully in combat to bring down a Russian Shahed drone on 17 January 2024 from 9 km distance.

=== Evolved Sea Sparrow missile (ESSM) ===
Although the Navy and Air Force initially planned additional upgrades for the Sparrow, notably the AIM-7R with a combination radar/infrared seeker, these were canceled in favor of the much more advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM in December 1996. With the link between the airborne and shipborne versions of the Sparrow severed, Raytheon proposed a much more extensive set of upgrades to the Sea Sparrow, the RIM-7R Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM). The changes were so extensive that the project was renamed, becoming the RIM-162 ESSM.

The ESSM takes the existing guidance section from the RIM-7P and fits it to an entirely new rear-section. The new missile is in diameter instead of the previous 8 inches, which allows for a much more powerful motor. It also eliminates the mid-mounted wings entirely, replacing them with long fins similar to those on the Standard missile (and practically every other Navy missile since the 1950s) and moves guidance control to the rear fins. The tail-fin based steering of the ESSM uses up more energy but offers considerably higher maneuverability while the engine is still firing.

The Mark 25 quad-missile pack was developed during the 1990s to fit four ESSMs into a single Mk 41 VLS cell. For VLS use, ESSMs are fitted with the same JVC system as the earlier versions.

<text>&quot;The Imperial March (Darth Vader&#x27;s Theme)&quot; is a musical theme present in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. It was composed by John Williams for the film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Together with &quot;Yoda&#x27;s Theme&quot;, &quot;The Imperial March&quot; was premiered on April 29, 1980, three weeks before the opening of the film, on the occasion of John Williams&#x27; first concert as official conductor-in-residence of the Boston Pops Orchestra. One of the best known symphonic movie themes, it is used as a leitmotif throughout the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

&lt;/score&gt;

==Use in &quot;Star Wars&quot;==
&quot;The Imperial March&quot; is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;Darth Vader&#x27;s Theme.&quot; In the movies (except for the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;), the march is often played when Darth Vader appears. It is also played during Darth Sidious&#x27;s arrival on the Death Star in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, though it does segue into the Emperor&#x27;s own theme as he appears.

===Original trilogy===
&quot;The Imperial March&quot; is first heard in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; in low piccolos as the Galactic Empire sends probe droids across the galaxy in search of Luke Skywalker. Its major opening occurs as &quot;Imperial&quot;-class Star Destroyers amass and Darth Vader is first presented in the film, 19 minutes into the movie. The theme and related motifs are also incorporated into tracks such as &quot;The Battle of Hoth&quot; during the eponymous battle, &quot;The Asteroid Field&quot; during the chase sequence involving the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;, and &quot;The Clash of Lightsabers&quot; during Luke and Vader&#x27;s duel on Cloud City over Bespin. &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; makes similar use of the theme, though its final statement is significantly different, making quiet use of a harp as a redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son&#x27;s arms.

===Prequel trilogy===
&quot;The Imperial March&quot; appears on a few occasions in the prequel trilogy, most often used to foreshadow Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s future as Darth Vader. An innocent theme for the nine-year-old Anakin in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; at 1H10 is thematically based on &quot;The Imperial March.&quot; &quot;The Imperial March&quot; is also heard towards the end, as Yoda acknowledges Anakin as Obi-Wan&#x27;s apprentice in saying &quot;The Chosen One, the boy may be. Nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training&quot; at 2H06. It is also heard softly at the end of the final credit roll, where it fades into the character&#x27;s signature breathing, showing that the rest of the prequel trilogy will reveal how Anakin became Darth Vader. In the second prequel, &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, &quot;The Imperial March&quot; is sometimes played subtly when an event foreshadows Anakin&#x27;s future: It is first played when Yoda senses Anakin slaughtering a tribe of Tusken Raiders to avenge his mother&#x27;s death and later with more force when Anakin tells Padmé Amidala what he did. It is played most prominently and recognizably during the final sequence when clone troopers assemble and depart Coruscant, foreshadowing the end of the Republic. Although &quot;Across the Stars&quot; is featured most prominently in the film&#x27;s end credits, several notes from &quot;The Imperial March&quot; are heard beneath it near the end.

In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; &quot;The Imperial March&quot; is first played when Anakin rebukes the Jedi Council for denying him the rank of Jedi Master, although appointing him to the Council at 0H37. The track can also be heard when Anakin tells Mace Windu about Palpatine&#x27;s true identity, Darth Sidious. It is later played when Anakin is dubbed as the Sith Darth Vader, shortly after the death of Mace Windu. &quot;The Imperial March&quot; is quoted when clone troopers find dead Wookiees on Kashyyyk and when Padmé confronts Anakin on Mustafar. A few notes of the &quot;March&quot; are played when Vader arrives on Mustafar to kill the Separatists. The piece is played more clearly during the &quot;Battle of the Heroes&quot; scene between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader at the movie&#x27;s climax and in the simultaneous battle between Yoda and Sidious, as a rearrangement of the version heard in &quot;The Clash of Lightsabers&quot; from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. It is also played when Darth Vader receives his armor at 2H06 and when he looks up at the first Death Star with Sidious at 2H11.

===Sequel trilogy===
In the 2015 &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, two bars from the brass motif of &quot;The Imperial March&quot; are played after antagonist Kylo Ren regards the charred remains of Darth Vader&#x27;s helmet, vowing to finally succeed where the Galactic Empire failed. In the 2017 &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, the track was briefly played after Supreme Leader Snoke compares antagonist Kylo Ren to Darth Vader, saying he saw the potential of &quot;A new Vader.&quot; In the 2019 &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; the track is present in the scenes where the mask of Darth Vader is shown, when Darth Sidious first reveals the Final Order, a massive armada of &quot;Xyston&quot;-class Star Destroyers built by the Sith Eternal, to Kylo Ren, when Rey seeks Sidious&#x27; Sith wayfinder in the Death Star&#x27;s wreckage, and when a Sith Star Destroyer arrives to destroy Kijimi.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot; Anthology===
Trailers for &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot; featured the track prominently; the first notes of &quot;The Imperial March&quot; can be heard at the end of the trailer as the letters turn to reveal the name of the upcoming movie. Prior to this, Darth Vader can be heard breathing and his appearance is seen as a reflection on the floor. In the film proper, scored by Michael Giacchino, the theme can be heard when Vader emerges from his sanctum to confer with Director Orson Krennic, and again after Vader warns Krennic about overstepping his bounds. The theme can be heard once more when Vader attacks the Rebel soldiers trapped in a hallway; it is slowed down enough not to be obvious and joined with a chorus reminiscent of that from &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. The theme is finally heard outright when Vader witnesses the &quot;Tantive IV&quot; fleeing into hyperspace.

The track appears early in &quot;&quot;, transposed into a major key, as diegetic music in the Corellia spaceport as part of a commercial encouraging viewers to join the Imperial Navy, encouraging Han Solo to enlist as his ticket off the planet. This brief appearance marks the first and thus-far only in-universe appearance of &quot;The Imperial March&quot; in a theatrical film.

===&quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;===
&quot;The Imperial March&quot; has influence in short but dark moments revolving around Anakin. For example, in episode 62, &quot;Citadel Rescue&quot;, Anakin and Captain Wilhuff Tarkin both mention during their escape their good relationship with the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. Anakin shakes hands with Tarkin at the end of the episode, while Tarkin says he will inform the Chancellor of Anakin&#x27;s good performance. During that handshake, a hint is to be heard in the music referring to &quot;The Imperial March.&quot; Other episodes that feature the theme include &quot;Brain Invaders&quot; (when Anakin strangles Poggle), &quot;Voyage of Temptation&quot; (when Anakin kills Merrik), &quot;Overlords&quot; (multiple times), &quot;Ghosts of Mortis&quot; (multiple times), &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (when Obi-Wan talks with Anakin and then Ahsoka), &quot;Deception&quot; (multiple times) and &quot;Friends and Enemies&quot; (multiple times), &quot;Crisis on Naboo&quot; (when Anakin argues with Obi-Wan), &quot;The Lawless&quot; (during Darth Sidious scenes), and &quot;The Jedi Who Knew Too Much&quot; (multiple times). The theme is used prominently during the sixth season.

===&quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;===
In &quot;Empire Day&quot;, the episode&#x27;s title referring to the Empire&#x27;s anniversary, &quot;The Imperial Anthem&quot; arrangement of &quot;The Imperial March&quot;, is heard during the parade. The march is also heard in &quot;Call to Action&quot; when Grand Moff Tarkin arrives on Lothal, in the final scene of &quot;Fire Across the Galaxy&quot; when Darth Vader arrives on Lothal, and in multiple scenes in &quot;The Siege of Lothal.&quot;

===&quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;===
In &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;, the march is heard in &quot;Part VI&quot; after Darth Vader&#x27;s contact with Darth Sidious.

<text>Dettifoss () is a waterfall in Vatnajökull National Park in Northeast Iceland, and is reputed to be the second most powerful waterfall in Europe after the Rhine Falls. Dettifoss is situated on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river, which flows from the Vatnajökull glacier and collects water from a large area in Northeast Iceland. The sediment-rich runoff colours the water a greyish white.

The falls are wide and have a drop of down to the canyon Jökulsárgljúfur. It is the second largest waterfall in Iceland in terms of volume discharge (behind the Urriðafoss), having an average water flow of 193 m³/s. The superlative of &quot;most powerful&quot; comes from its water flow multiplied by its fall distance.

==Tourist access==
Dettifoss is served on its west side by Route 862, a tarmac road built in 2011. Road 862 gives access to Dettifoss in all seasons more and less, while an older gravel road (Route 864) serves the east side and is usually passable in summer only.

On the west bank there are minimal facilities, including a pit toilet, maintained hiking path and a view-platform. On the east bank there is an information panel maintained by the staff of Vatnajökull National Park (&quot;&quot;), a public toilet, and a trail to the waterfall.

Dettifoss is located on the Diamond Circle, a popular tourist route around Húsavík and Lake Mývatn in North Iceland.

==In media==
The musical composition &quot;Dettifoss&quot; (Op. 57) by Jón Leifs is inspired by this waterfall.

The waterfall is featured in the 2012 science-fiction film &quot;Prometheus&quot;, standing in as landscape on a primordial Earth-like planet.

<doc id="574933" wikidata="Q634785" url="?curid=574933" title="Countdown to Ecstasy">
<text>Countdown to Ecstasy is the second studio album by American rock band Steely Dan, released in July 1973, by ABC Records. It was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California, except for Rick Derringer&#x27;s slide guitar part for &quot;Show Biz Kids&quot;, which was recorded at Caribou Ranch in Nederland, Colorado. After the departure of vocalist David Palmer from Steely Dan, the group recorded the album with Donald Fagen singing lead on every track.

Although the album was a critical success, it failed to generate a hit single in the United States, and consequently only charted at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart, though it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1978. The album has received perfect scores from music critics in numerous retrospective reviews.

==Musical style==
Like Steely Dan&#x27;s 1972 debut album &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;, &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; has a rock sound that exhibits a strong influence from jazz. It comprises uptempo, four- to five-minute rock songs, which, apart from the bluesy vamps of &quot;Bodhisattva&quot; and &quot;Show Biz Kids&quot;, are subtly textured and feature jazz-inspired interludes. Commenting on the album&#x27;s style and production, music critic Tom Hull said it is &quot;clean, almost slick&quot;, with &quot;no dissonance, no clutter&quot;, reminiscent of 1940s bop and &quot;the overproduced early 60s pop rock&quot;. &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; was the only Steely Dan album written and arranged for a live band.

Bop-style jazz soloing is set in the context of a pop song on &quot;Bodhisattva&quot;. &quot;The Boston Rag&quot; develops from a jazzy song to unrefined playing by the band, including a distorted guitar solo by Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter. &quot;My Old School&quot; features reverent saxophones and aggressive piano riffs and guitar solos. Jim Hodder&#x27;s drumming on the album eschews rock music for pop and jazz grooves.

==Lyrics and themes==
&quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; has similar lyrical themes to &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;. It explores topics such as drug abuse, class envy, and West Coast excess. &quot;Your Gold Teeth&quot; follows a jaded female who uses her attractiveness and cunning to take advantage of others, &quot;My Old School&quot; was inspired by a drug bust involving Walter Becker and Donald Fagen while they were students at Bard College, &quot;King of the World&quot; explores a post-nuclear holocaust United States, and &quot;Show Biz Kids&quot; satirizes contemporary Los Angeles lifestyles. Critic Tom Hull described the lyrics as &quot;a running paste together joke [...] sufraintelligent, witty and slyly devious&quot;, citing as an example the following lyrics from &quot;Show Biz Kids&quot;: &quot;They got the booze they need / All that money can buy / They got the shapely bods / They got the Steely Dan T-shirt / And for the coup de grâce / They&#x27;re outrageous.&quot;

According to Rob Sheffield, Becker and Fagen&#x27;s lyrics on the album portray America as &quot;one big Las Vegas, with gangsters and gurus hustling for souls to steal.&quot; He views it as the first in a trilogy of Steely Dan albums that, along with &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; (1974) and &quot;Katy Lied&quot; (1975), showcase &quot;a film noir tour of L.A.&#x27;s decadent losers, showbiz kids, and razor boys.&quot; Erik Adams of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the album a &quot;dossier of literate lowlifes, the type of character studies that say, &#x27;Why yes, the name Steely Dan is an allusion to a dildo described in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.&#x27; These characters hang around the corners of the entire Steely Dan discography, but they come into their own on &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot;&quot;.

Some songs on the album explore more spiritual concerns. The opening song, &quot;Bodhisattva&quot;, is a parody of the idea that the disposal of one&#x27;s possessions is a prerequisite to enlightenment. Its title refers to Bodhisattva, or people who are of the belief that they have achieved spiritual perfection, but remain in the material world to help others. Fagen summarized the song&#x27;s message as: &quot;Lure of East. Hubris of hippies. Quick fix&quot;. &quot;Razor Boy&quot;, meanwhile, is a bitter, ironic pop song with lyrics that subtly criticize complacency and materialism. According to Ivan Kreilkamp of &quot;Spin&quot;, in the song &quot;Steely Dan speaks to us from that &#x27;cold and windy day&#x27; when the trappings of hipness and sexiness fall away to reveal a lonely figure waiting for a fix. &#x27;Will you still have a song to sing when the razor boy comes and takes your fancy things away?&#x27; Fagen asks a generation stupefied by nostalgia and self-involvement&quot;.

==Title and packaging==
The album&#x27;s title was selected as a joke about attempts to rationalize a state of spirituality. The original cover painting was done by Fagen&#x27;s then girlfriend, Dorothy White. The president of ABC Records, Jay Lasker, disliked it and insisted it be re-drawn. The art proofs were subsequently stolen by Becker and Fagen during an argument over the final layout.

==Marketing and sales==
&quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; was released in July 1973 by ABC Records in the United States and Probe Records in the United Kingdom. It failed to generate a hit single and was less commercially successful than &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;, only charting at number 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. Nonetheless, it spent 34 weeks on the chart and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1978, recognizing the shipment of 500,000 copies in the U.S.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the album in August 1973 for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Logan said that, while it might follow a &quot;formula&quot;, the songs do not become &quot;redundant or superfluous&quot;, and that, though the band&#x27;s &quot;playing is hardly unique and their singing is occasionally hampered by patently ridiculous lyrics, they exhibit a control of the basic rock format that is refreshing and that bodes well for the group&#x27;s long-term success.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented the &quot;studio effect&quot; of the dual guitar playing and found the &quot;grandiloquent vocal blend&quot; catchy. &quot;Stereo Review&quot; called it a &quot;really excellent album&quot; with &quot;witty and tasteful&quot; arrangements, &quot;winning&quot; performances, &quot;high quality&quot; songs, and a &quot;potent and persuasive&quot; mix of rock, jazz, and pop styles. In &quot;Creem&quot;, Robert Christgau made reference to &quot;studio-perfect licks that crackle and buzz when you listen hard&quot; and &quot;invariably malicious&quot; vocals that back the group&#x27;s obscure lyrics, and he named &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; the ninth best album of 1973 in his year-end list for &quot;Newsday&quot;. Tom Hull, in a review published in &quot;Overdose&quot; in April 1975, said the album is &quot;perhaps the most representative, certainly the best realized,&quot; of Steely Dan&#x27;s albums, as far as their &quot;clean, almost slick&quot; style is concerned, and called the overall effect &quot;strange, strangely comfortable, queasy almost&quot;, and the band &quot;a dangerous group, one that should be watched.&quot;

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau said that, thanks to Fagen&#x27;s replacement of Palmer, who Christgau felt did not fit the group, Steely Dan was able to achieve a &quot;deceptively agreeable studio slickness&quot; on the album. Paul Lester described the album in an entry in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Albums&quot; (1998) as a progression from &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot;, and wrote that &quot;Becker and Fagen offered cruel critiques of the self-obsessed &#x27;Me&#x27; decade&quot;, while their &quot;blend of cool jazz and bebop, Brill Building song craft and rock was unparallelled at the time (only Britain&#x27;s 10cc were creating such intelligent pop in the early Seventies).&quot; In his 1999 autobiography &quot;A Cure for Gravity&quot;, British musician Joe Jackson described &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; as a musical revelation for him that bridged the gap between &quot;pure pop&quot; and his jazz-rock and progressive influences and influenced his subsequent attempts at songwriting. Pat Blashill wrote in a review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2003 that the &quot;joy in these excellent songs&quot; and in the band&#x27;s playing revealed Steely Dan to be &quot;human, not just brainy,&quot; &quot;like good stretches of the Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Rob Sheffield called the album &quot;a thoroughly amazing, hugely influential album&quot; with &quot;cold-blooded L.A. studio rock tricked out with jazz piano and tough guitar.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; to be &quot;riskier&quot; musically than the band&#x27;s debut album, and called the songs &quot;rich with either musical or lyrical detail that [Steely Dan&#x27;s] album rock or art rock contemporaries couldn&#x27;t hope to match.&quot; Chris Jones of BBC Music said the ideas on the album are &quot;post-modern&quot; and &quot;erudite&quot;, and asserted that the band was &quot;setting a benchmark that few have ever matched.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; was voted number 307 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="574934" wikidata="Q3273867" url="?curid=574934" title="MacDowell (artists' residency and workshop)">
<text>MacDowell is an artist&#x27;s residency program in Peterborough, New Hampshire. The program was founded in 1907 by composer Edward MacDowell and his wife, pianist and philanthropist Marian MacDowell. Prior to July 2020, it was known as the MacDowell Colony or &quot;The Colony&quot;, but its board of directors shortened the name to remove &quot;terminology with oppressive overtones&quot;.

After Edward MacDowell died in 1908, Marian MacDowell established the artists&#x27; residency program through a nonprofit association in honor of her husband, raising funds to transform her farm into a quiet retreat for creative artists to work. She led the organization for almost 25 years.

Over the years, an estimated 9,000 artists have been supported in residence with nearly 16,000 fellowships, including the winners of at least 102 Pulitzer Prizes, 33 National Book Awards, 31 Tony Awards, 34 MacArthur Fellowships, 18 Grammys, 9 Oscars, 969 Guggenheim Fellowships, and 122 Rome Prizes. The artists&#x27; residency program has accepted visual and interdisciplinary artists, architects, filmmakers, composers, playwrights, poets, and writers, both well-known and unknown. Since January 2020, Nell Painter has served as chair of MacDowell, the first woman to hold the position. In February 2023, Chiwoniso Kaitano was appointed MacDowell&#x27;s executive director, the first black person to serve in the role.

== History ==

In 1896, pianist Marian MacDowell bought Hillcrest Farm in Peterborough, New Hampshire, as a summer residence for herself and her husband, composer Edward MacDowell. She had always been careful to give him a quiet room for his work. They found that the New Hampshire landscape enhanced his work of composing music.

The couple formulated a plan to provide an interdisciplinary experience in a nurturing landscape, by creating an institutionalized residential art colony in the area. In 1904, Edward MacDowell began to show signs of an illness that ended his composing and teaching career. He died in 1908.

In 1907, Marian MacDowell deeded their farm to the Edward MacDowell Association and founded the MacDowell Colony. The first guests arrived that year: sisters Helen Farnsworth Mears, a sculptor, and Mary Mears, a writer. Mears wrote about her time on site for &quot;The Craftsman&quot; in July 1909. MacDowell began by inviting applicants personally, but by the 1920s had consigned the admission process to a committee.

Marian and friends raised funds and found support from industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, former U.S. President Grover Cleveland, financier J. P. Morgan, other prominent people, as well as many others across the country. MacDowell said the most consistent support came from women&#x27;s clubs and professional music sororities (see, for example, the MacDowell Club of New York). At the age of 50, MacDowell began lecturing to women&#x27;s groups to raise funds, resumed her performing career, and became a noted interpreter of her husband&#x27;s work.

Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge organized an effort in 1916 to build and name a studio at MacDowell in memory of her teacher Regina Watson. It was renovated in 1993 and became McDowell&#x27;s first barrier-free studio that was accessible to everyone.

By 1918, 31 of Isabelle Sprague Smith&#x27;s students funded the creation of the Isabelle D. Sprague Smith studio. Through the years more separate studios were built. The program continues in 32 studios scattered over of land.

On March 13, 2020, MacDowell shut in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak and sent artists and fellows home. It was the first time the site had shut since the 1938 New England hurricane. MacDowell reopened its doors in October of 2020.

== Medal Day ==
Every year, MacDowell presents the Edward MacDowell Medal to an artist who has made a significant cultural contribution. Residency at MacDowell is not a requirement. Medal Day is one of the rare occasions when the site is open to the public. The ceremony includes a keynote speech, after which the artists open their studios to visitors.

==Property tax dispute==
MacDowell, a non-profit organization, enjoys the status of a charity, entitling it to exemption from local property taxes, among other things. However, in 2005, the town of Peterborough&#x27;s selectmen (local-government executives) decided to challenge MacDowell&#x27;s charitable status and billed the organization for a &quot;payment in lieu of taxes&quot;. A lawyer for the town argued that &quot;the Colony certainly benefits its artists-in-residence, but that doesn&#x27;t strike us as being the general public.&quot;

The then-Board of Directors paid the bill, then successfully challenged the charge. A 2007 Superior Court opinion found that the MacDowell Colony, by promoting the arts, was a charitable institution, a ruling that was upheld by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in a subsequent appeal. The appeal court found that &quot;Contrary to the Town&#x27;s assertions, MacDowell&#x27;s articles of incorporation oblige it to use its property for its stated charitable purpose.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1962, the site and buildings were designated a National Historic Landmark District.

In 1997, MacDowell Colony was awarded the National Medal of Arts.
