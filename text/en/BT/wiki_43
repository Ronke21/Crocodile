<text>The spot-billed pelican (Pelecanus philippensis) or gray pelican is a member of the pelican family. It breeds in southern Asia from southern Iran across India east to Indonesia. It is a bird of large inland and coastal waters, especially large lakes. At a distance they are difficult to differentiate from other pelicans in the region although it is smaller but at close range the spots on the upper mandible, the lack of bright colours and the greyer plumage are distinctive. In some areas these birds nest in large colonies close to human habitations.

==Taxonomy==
The spot-billed pelican was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other pelicans in the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus philippensis&quot;. Gmelin based his description on &quot;Le pélican des Philippines&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. Brisson&#x27;s specimen had been collected on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==

The spot-billed pelican is a rather large water bird, often the largest or one of the largest native birds in the southern stretches of its range, albeit it is fairly small for a pelican. It is long and a weight of . The wingspan can vary from while the typically large beak measured from . It is mainly white, with a grey crest, hindneck and a brownish tail. The feathers on the hind neck are curly and form a greyish nape crest. The pouch is pink to purplish and has large pale spots, and is also spotted on the sides of the upper mandible. The tip of the bill (or nail) is yellow to orange. In breeding plumage, the skin at the base of the beak is dark and the orbital patch is pink. In flight they look not unlike the Dalmatian pelican but the tertials and inner secondaries are darker and a pale band runs along the greater coverts. The tail is rounder.

The newly hatched young are covered in white down. They then moult into a greyish speckled plumage. The spots on the bill appear only after a year. The full adult breeding plumage appears in their third year.

== Distribution and habitat==

The species is found to breed only in peninsular India, Sri Lanka and in Cambodia. A few birds from India are known to winter in the Gangetic plains but reports of its presence in many other parts of the region such as the Maldives, Pakistan and Bangladesh has been questioned. The main habitat is in shallow lowland freshwaters. The spot-billed pelican is not migratory but are known to make local movements and are more widely distributed in the non-breeding season.

This species is a colonial breeder, often breeding in the company of other waterbirds. The nests are on low trees near wetlands and sometimes near human habitations. Many large breeding colonies have been recorded and several have disappeared over time. In June 1906, C E Rhenius visited a colony in Kundakulam in Tirunelveli district where the villages considered the birds semi-sacred. The same colony was revisited in 1944, and was found to have about 10 nests of pelicans and nearly 200 nests of painted stork.

The Sittang River in Burma was said by E W Oates to have &quot;millions&quot; of pelicans in 1877 and in 1929 E C Stuart Baker reported that they were still nesting in thousands along with greater adjutant storks:
This colony was however reported by B E Smythies to have disappeared between the 1930s and the 1940s.

Another colony was discovered in 1902 at a village called Buchupalle in the Cudappah district, where these pelicans nested along with painted storks during the month of March. This colony was never traced again. The Kolleru Lake colony was discovered by K K Neelakantan in 1946. Nearly 3000 pelicans nested in this colony at the time of discovery. This colony however disappeared around 1975.

Due to habitat loss and human disturbance, the spot-billed pelican&#x27;s numbers have declined and many populations in Southeast Asia (including parts of China) are now extinct. The specific name refers to the Philippines, where the species was abundant in the early 1900s but declined and become locally extinct in the 1960s. The populations in southern India are thought to be on the rise. Estimates suggest that increased protection has since enabled a recovery in their numbers and the status of the species was changed from vulnerable to near threatened in the 2007 IUCN Red List.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

They are very silent although at their nests they can make hisses, grunts or snap their bills. Some early descriptions of nesting colonies have claimed them to be distinctive in their silence but most have noted colonies as noisy.

Like most other pelicans, it catches fish in its huge bill pouch while swimming at the surface. Unlike the great white pelican it does not form large feeding flocks and is usually found to fish singly or in small flocks. Groups may however sometimes line up and drive fish towards the shallows. When flying to their roosts or feeding areas, small groups fly in formation with steady flapping. During the hot part of the day, they often soar on thermals. They may forage at night to some extent.

The birds nest in colonies and the nest is a thick platform of twigs placed on a low tree. The breeding season varies from October to May. In Tamil Nadu, the breeding season follows the onset of the northeast monsoon. The courtship display of the males involves a distention of the pouch with swinging motions of the head up and down followed by sideways swings followed by the head being held back over the back. Bill claps may also be produced during the head swaying movements. The nests are usually built alongside other colonial waterbirds, particularly painted storks. Three to four chalky white eggs is the usual clutch. The eggs become dirty with age. Eggs hatch in about 30–33 days. The young stay in or near the nest from three to five months. In captivity the young are able to breed after two years. Like other pelicans, they cool themselves using gular fluttering and panting.

The trematode parasite &quot;Renicola pelecani&quot; was described from the kidneys of a specimen of a Sri Lankan spot-billed pelican that died at the London zoo.

== In culture ==
This species was once used by fishermen in parts of eastern Bengal as decoys for certain fish. These fishermen believed that an oily secretion from the bird attracted certain fish such as &quot;Colisa&quot; and &quot;Anabas&quot;.

The propensity of these birds to nest close to human habitations has been noted from the time of T C Jerdon:
Several colonies have since been discovered and while many of these have vanished others have been protected and a few villages with nesting colonies have become popular tourist attractions. Well known villages with colonies include Kokrebellur, Koothankulam and Uppalapadu.

<doc id="571061" wikidata="Q3049112" url="?curid=571061" title="Egan v Canada">
<text>Egan v Canada, [1995] 2 SCR 513 was one of a trilogy of equality rights cases published by the Supreme Court of Canada in the second quarter of 1995. It stands today as a landmark Supreme Court case which established that sexual orientation constitutes a prohibited basis of discrimination under section 15 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

==Background==
The plaintiffs—James Egan, a long-time LGBTQ rights activist, and John Norris Nesbit—were a gay couple who had been in a conjugal relationship since 1948. Upon reaching age 65 in 1986, Egan became eligible to receive Old Age Security and a guaranteed income supplement from the government under the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot;.

The &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; provides that a spouse of the pensioner may receive a spousal allowance should their combined income fall below a certain amount. When Nesbit reached 65, he applied to the Department of National Health and Welfare for a spousal allowance. However, he was refused on the basis that &quot;spouse&quot;, defined in section 2 of &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot;, did not include a member of the same sex.

Joseph J. Arvay, Q.C., represented the plaintiffs, who delivered a motion for a declaration of unconstitutionality to the Federal Court of Canada (Trial Division). They alleged the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; under the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; constituted an infringement of their right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law, entrenched in section 15 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, and that such an infringement was discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation. They also alleged the section 15 violation could not be saved under section 1. Nesbit and Egan asked the Court to remedy the alleged &quot;Charter&quot; violation by reading the definition of spouse so as to include same-sex couples.

==Judgment of the Federal Court of Canada, Trial Division==
The trial judge held that although the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; as defined in section 2 of the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; created a distinction, it was merely a distinction between spouses and &quot;non-spouses&quot; (e.g., siblings), the latter being a group which Parliament had allegedly not intended to confer similar benefits upon. The trial judge held the distinction between spouses and &quot;non-spouses&quot; had nothing to do with sexual orientation and therefore could not constitute discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The application was dismissed. This decision was appealed by the plaintiff to the Federal Court of Appeal.

==Judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal==
On April 29, 1993, the Federal Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge&#x27;s judgment and dismissed the appeal by a 2–1 majority.

===Reasons of Robertson JA===
Robertson JA held the definition of &quot;spouse&quot;, as defined by section 2 of the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot;, did not discriminate against the appellants, Egan and Nesbit, by virtue of the fact the definition merely created a &quot;distinction&quot; between spouses and non-spouses. Robertson held the issue in the case was not solely concerned over the question of who may receive spousal allowances, but was in actuality &quot;an indirect challenge to the common law and statutory concept of marriage&quot;. Our &quot;present understanding of the law of discrimination&quot;, Robertson argued, precluded the conclusion &quot;the common law limitations of marriage to persons of the opposite sex&quot; constitutes discrimination under section 15 of the &quot;Charter&quot;.

===Reasons of Mahoney JA===
In a concurring judgment, Mahoney JA adopted the reasoning of the trial judge, holding the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; did not discriminate against the appellants. Mahoney noted there were a broad range of &quot;non-spouses&quot; who lived together. They too are denied a spousal allowance, but on the basis of their &quot;non-spousal status&quot;. Mahoney JA held the &quot;Charter&quot; challenge was misplaced: in his view, the discrimination the appellants alleged was due to &quot;the failure of the definition to comprehend the concept of common law marriage between persons of the same sex&quot; and not on the basis of their sexual orientation.

===Reasons of Linden JA===
In dissent, Linden JA accused the other two justices of engaging in exercises of circular reasoning:
::The issue before this Court is whether the definition of spouse in the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; creates a distinction in the distribution of benefits which is discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation. That issue cannot be resolved simply by stating that the distinction drawn by the &quot;Act&quot; is based on the definition of spouse rather than on sexual orientation. It is, after all, the definition of spouse that is being attacked as discriminatory.

Linden concluded the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; under the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; created a distinction between heterosexuals and homosexuals which constituted discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Linden also concluded the exclusion of same-sex couples from the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; did not minimally impair the appellants&#x27; section 15 rights.

==Judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada==
In a 4–1–4 vote, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal and upheld the constitutionality of the impugned definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot;.

===Majority reasons===
Writing for the majority (Lamer CJ and La Forest, Gonthier and Major JJ), La Forest J held the exclusion of same-sex couples from the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the impugned &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; did not violate section 15 of the &quot;Charter&quot;. La Forest J said the controlling issue in section 15 cases is whether a legislative distinction (based on a protected ground) is &quot;irrelevant&quot; to the objective of the legislation in question and therefore discriminatory. He recognized the objective of the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; was the &quot;support and protection of legal marriage&quot;, an institution which he described as:

::firmly anchored in the biological and social realities that heterosexual couples have the unique ability to procreate, that most children are the product of these relationships, and that they are generally cared for and nurtured by those who live in that relationship. In this sense, marriage is by nature heterosexual.

La Forest J said sexual orientation is inextricably relevant to the objective of the impugned &quot;Act&quot; given the heterosexual nature of marriage. Therefore, he held it was not discriminatory under section 15 of the &quot;Charter&quot;.

La Forest J added in &quot;obiter&quot; that had he found the impugned definition discriminatory, he would have upheld it under section 1 of the &quot;Charter&quot; &quot;for the considerations set forth in my reasons in &quot;McKinney&quot;, &quot;supra&quot;, especially at pp. 316-18 ...&quot;

===Concurring reasons===
Concurring only in the result, Sopinka J disagreed with the plurality&#x27;s reasoning that section 2 of the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot; was not discriminatory. Sopinka J also endorsed the section 15 analysis performed by Cory J. However, Sopinka J argued the Canadian government must be afforded some &quot;flexibility in extending social benefits&quot; and that the government need not be &quot;pro-active in recognizing new social relationships&quot;:

::It is not realistic for the Court to assume that there are unlimited funds to address the needs of all. A judicial approach on this basis would tend to make a government reluctant to create any new social benefit schemes because their limits would depend on an accurate prediction of the outcome of court proceedings under s. 15(1) of the Charter.

Sopinka J cites &quot;McKinney v University of Guelph&quot; in defence of his reasoning, noting there are situations in which legislatures may take an &quot;incremental&quot; approach to address novel issues.

===Dissenting reasons===
The remaining four justices dissented, all rejecting the &quot;irrelevance&quot; approach as articulated by La Forest J and the &quot;incremental&quot; doctrine suggested by Sopinka J.

====Cory and Iacobucci JJ====
In joint reasons, Cory and Iacobucci JJ articulated a section 15 analysis closely following the approach laid out in &quot;Andrews&quot;. Iacobucci, in turn, wrote the Section 1 analysis.

In his section 15 analysis, Cory J disputes this was a case revolving around the concept of &quot;adverse effect discrimination&quot;, that is, a neutral law which discriminates against a group only by the effect of the same application. Rather, he conceded that the law being challenged—the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in lieu of section 2 of the &quot;Old Age Security Act&quot;—&quot;is, quite simply, not facially neutral&quot; at all. Rather, since the impugned &quot;Act&quot; defines a spouse only in opposite sex terms, it &quot;draws a clear distinction between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples&quot;.

To be discriminatory within the meaning of section 15 of the &quot;Charter&quot;, Cory J argued the distinction only had to be made on an enumerated or analogous ground protected by section 15. As such, the appellant did not have to prove the distinction on such a basis is irrelevant to the objective of the legislation.

In this case, Cory J asserted there &quot;can be no doubt that the distinction is related to the personal characteristic of sexual orientation&quot;:

It may be correct to say that being in a same-sex relationship is not necessarily the defining characteristic of being homosexual. Yet, only homosexual individuals will form a part of a same-sex common law couple. It is the sexual orientation of the individuals involved which leads to the formation of the homosexual couple. The sexual orientation of the individual members cannot be divorced from the homosexual couple. To find otherwise would be as wrong as saying that being pregnant had nothing to do with being female. The words &quot;of the opposite sex&quot; in the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; specifically exclude homosexual couples from claiming a spousal allowance.

Cory J argued this distinction was not based on anything other than the appellants&#x27; sexual orientation and was therefore discriminatory.

Regarding the section 1 analysis, Iacobucci J identified the objective of the impugned legislation as &quot;the alleviation of poverty in elderly households&quot;. He held this to be a &quot;pressing and substantial&quot; government objective under the &quot;Oakes&quot; test. However, Iacobucci J held the section 15 violation (the exclusion of same-sex couples from the definition of &quot;spouse&quot;) was not rationally connected to that goal:

If there is an intention to ameliorate the position of a group, it cannot be considered entirely rational to assist only a portion of that group. A more rationally connected means to the end would be to assist the entire group, as that is the very objective which is sought.

Further, Iacobucci balked at the notion the cost of extending such monetary benefits may be justified as a reasonable limitation. He deplored the evidence adduced in support of this notion as &quot;highly speculative and statistically weak&quot; at best. Regardless, he endorsed the view in &quot;Schachter&quot; that &quot;budgetary considerations cannot be used to justify a violation under s. 1&quot;.

Finally, Iacobucci J asserted the suggestion there is precedent for an &quot;incremental approach&quot; as a misrepresentation of the Court&#x27;s view in &quot;McKinney&quot;. He noted the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;McKinney&quot; was far more complex, having the potential to affect &quot;the entire composition of the workforce; the ability of younger people to secure jobs; access to university resources; promotion of academic freedom, excellence and renewal; collective bargaining rights; and the structure of pension plans&quot;. In contrast, he argued the case at hand created no such issue. In addition, he argued the &quot;incremental&quot; approach offered by Sopinka J introduced &quot;two unprecedented and potentially undefinable criteria into s. 1 analysis&quot;. He said such a level of deference to the legislatures carries the potential to completely undermine the effectiveness of the &quot;Charter&quot;.

====L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé====
L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé J wrote her own dissent expounding on what she thought ought to be the appropriate approach in both the sections 15 and 1 analyses. First and foremost, she is extremely critical of the &quot;irrelevance&quot; approach expounded by La Forest. She contends that the approach defeats the very purpose of the equality rights in Section 15 of the Charter, noting that the objective of the Act in question may be discriminatory per se, but would survive constitutional scrutiny.

L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé argues that, for the purpose of the Section 15 analysis, the appellant also need not prove that the distinction is made on one of the enlisted grounds in Section 15 or an analogous ground thereof:

::It is plain from the language of s. 15 that its fundamental purpose is to guarantee to all individuals a certain kind of equality: equality without discrimination. By implication, where &quot;discrimination&quot; is not present, then the Charter guarantee of equality is satisfied. The nine &quot;grounds&quot; enumerated after this basic guarantee of freedom from discrimination are particular applications and illustrations of the ambit of s. 15. They are not the guarantee itself.

Rather, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé preferred an approach giving substantial judicial discretion, in which the appellant must demonstrate that there is (1) &quot;a legislative distinction&quot;, (2) that this distinction leads to a denial of any equality right as per Section 15, and (3) that the distinction is &quot;discriminatory&quot;. That is if the distinction is:

::capable of either promoting or perpetuating the view that the individual adversely affected by this distinction is less capable, or less worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society, equally deserving of concern, respect, and consideration.

In her analysis, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé registers her accord with Cory&#x27;s finding that there is a legislative distinction being made. Furthermore, she concludes that the distinction denies the appellants the equal benefit of the law &quot;as a couple&quot;. Regarding the status of the appellants, she agrees with Cory that they are clearly part of a &quot;highly socially vulnerable group, in that they have suffered considerable historical disadvantage, stereotyping, marginalization and stigmatization within Canadian society.&quot; As for the nature of the interest affected, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé asserts that the appellants have been &quot;directly and completely excluded, as a couple, from any entitlement to a basic shared standard of living for elderly persons cohabiting in a relationship analogous to marriage.&quot; She characterizes the interest involved as &quot;an important facet of full and equal membership in Canadian society.&quot; The message this denial gives, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé argues, seems undeniable:

::Given the marginalized position of homosexuals in society, the metamessage that flows almost inevitably from excluding same-sex couples from such an important social institution is essentially that society considers such relationships to be less worthy of respect, concern and consideration than relationships involving members of the opposite sex.

She finds, therefore, that the exclusion of same-sex couples is indeed discriminatory and in violation of Section 15 of the Charter.

Regarding the Section 1 analysis, L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé registers her agreement with the analysis of Iacobucci and characterizes the &quot;incremental&quot; approach, suggested by Sopinka, as undermining the values that Section 1 sought to protect.

====McLachlin====
McLachlin wrote a succinct dissent registering her &quot;substantial agreement with the reasons of Justices Cory and Iacobucci&quot;.

==Significance of &quot;Egan v. Canada&quot; as a precedent==

===Victory for gay rights===
Although the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal, &quot;Egan v. Canada&quot; created an important precedent for gay rights activists. The Court unanimously held that sexual orientation is an analogous ground under Section 15 of the Charter and is therefore a prohibited ground of discrimination. Writing for the plurality, La Forest noted:

::I have no difficulty accepting the appellants&#x27; contention that whether or not sexual orientation is based on biological or physiological factors, which may be a matter of some controversy, it is a deeply personal characteristic that is either unchangeable or changeable only at unacceptable personal costs, and so falls within the ambit of s. 15 protection as being analogous to the enumerated grounds.

This excerpt has been frequently cited by the Courts in the fallout of &quot;Egan&quot;. The Supreme Court of Canada in particular has explicitly quoted it with approval in &quot;M. v. H.&quot; and in &quot;Vriend v. Alberta&quot;, and has similarly referred to it in &quot;Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada&quot;, &quot;Trinity Western University v. British Columbia College of Teachers&quot;, and &quot;Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36&quot;.

The Ontario Court of Appeal also cited this passage in &quot;Halpern v. Canada&quot;.

===Confusion surrounding the conflicting approaches in Egan===
While it is normally true that majority reasons are usually controlling under the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot; (precedent), &quot;Egan v. Canada&quot; would appear to be an exception. The &quot;irrelevance&quot; approach which prevailed by plurality in &quot;Egan&quot; was also rejected by the majority of the Supreme Court in &quot;Miron v. Trudel&quot;, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418, in which the more &quot;orthodox&quot; &quot;Andrews&quot; approach prevailed by plurality.

The difficulty in determining the &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; that &quot;Egan&quot; established is illustrated by the case &quot;Re Rosenberg et al. v. Attorney General of Canada&quot;. The case is virtually identical:

Nancy Rosenberg, the plaintiff, challenged the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1, as a violation of Section 15 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada conceded that the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot;, in light of &quot;Egan&quot;, violated Section 15 of the Charter. Nonetheless, they contended that since &quot;Egan&quot; could not be distinguished from the case at hand, the violation must be upheld under Section 1 of the Charter as matter of &quot;stare decisis&quot;. The plaintiffs, by contrary, argued that Iacobucci&#x27;s Section 1 analysis was controlling, pointing out that the plurality in &quot;Egan&quot; had only addressed the Section 1 issue &quot;obiter&quot; and it was, therefore, not binding under the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;. The Court held that Section 15 was indeed violated, but was nonetheless saved by Section 1 of the Charter.

On appeal, however, the Ontario Court of Appeal unanimously held that &quot;Egan&quot; clearly established that the exclusion of same-sex couples from the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; was a Section 15 violation. In addition, the Court held that &quot;Vriend&quot; served as the deathblow to the &quot;incremental&quot; approach suggested by Sopinka. Therefore, the violation could not be saved under Section 1 of the Charter and it was no longer necessary to consider whether the Trial Judge had erred in her application of &quot;stare decisis&quot;.

Confusion surrounding the conflicting approaches laid out in &quot;Egan&quot; has subsided with the formulation of a new Section 15 analysis established by a unanimous Supreme Court in &quot;Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)&quot;.

===Dissenting reasons adopted===
In a landmark decision, &quot;M v H&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada employed the new &quot;Law&quot; doctrine. Like &quot;Egan&quot;, it was contended that the exclusion of same-sex couples from a similar definition of &quot;spouse&quot;, as per Section 29 of the &quot;Family Law Act&quot;, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, was a Section 15 violation. The Court held, 8-1, that the exclusion of same-sex couples in the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; was indeed a Section 15 violation and could not be saved under Section 1 of the Charter.

<doc id="571066" wikidata="Q1640969" url="?curid=571066" title="Lisboa e Vale do Tejo">
<text>Lisboa e Vale do Tejo (; ) was one of the five regions of Portugal (NUTS II subdivisions). Today two of the subregions are in the new Lisboa Region, two in the Centro Region and one in the Alentejo Region.

The region still exists as the area of intervention of the CDDR planning region.

It had 3,447,173 inhabitants (2001), and its area was 11,930 km².

==NUTS II region and area of intervention of the CCDR-LVT==

&quot;Despite the territorial configuration for statistical purposes (National Statistical System in Portugal), in force since 2007, matching the NUTS II the Lisbon, Region Greater Lisbon (AML) - composed only NUTSIII Greater Lisbon and Setúbal Peninsula - the area of intervention of the CCDRLVT - Steering Committee and Regional Development, abbreviated to CCDR - (the Lisbon and the Tagus Valley), continues to be composed of 5 NUTSIII (Sub-regions: Greater Lisbon, Setúbal Peninsula, Middle Tagus, and Lezíria West Coast). 

For the Regional Funds, management responsibilities under the policy of the European Union in Portugal, this regions it&#x27;s the region of Lisbon that consists of Grande Lisboa and Península de Setúbal, for regional planning (Run, monitor and evaluate, at regional level, policies on environment, nature conservation, land management and city) the region is called Lisbon and the Tagus Valley (LVT), composed by 5 NUTSIII (Sub-regions: Greater Lisbon, Setúbal Peninsula, Middle Tagus, and Lezíria West Coast).&quot; ()

==Sub-regions==

The region includes five sub-regions (NUTS III subdivisions):
* Grande Lisboa
* Lezíria do Tejo
* Oeste
* Península de Setúbal

About NUTS II only: since 2002, the subregion Lezíria do Tejo was reinstated to the Alentejo Region and Oeste were reinstated to the Centro Region. The region changed the name from Lisboa e Vale do Tejo to Lisboa, its current designation.

==Other subdivisions==
The five subregions together contain 51 municipalities, which have a combined total of 525 parishes.

<text>Bruce Beresford (; born 16 August 1940) is an Australian film director, opera director, screenwriter, and producer. He began his career during the Australian New Wave, and has made more than 30 feature films over a 50-year career, both locally and internationally in the United States. He is a two-time Academy Award nominee, and a four-time AACTA/AFI Awards winner out of 10 total nominations

He was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, and Best Director for &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;. He won AACTA/AFI Awards – Best Direction (2) for &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot; (1976) and &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;, and Best Screenplay (2) for &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; and &quot;The Fringe Dwellers&quot; (1986).

In addition, four of Beresford&#x27;s films have been nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or, and four have been nominated for the Golden Bear. He has also been nominated for two BAFTA Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a Directors Guild of America Award, and won a Genie Award.

==Early life and education==
Beresford was born in Paddington, New South Wales, the son of Lona (née Warr) and Leslie Beresford, who sold electrical goods. He grew up in the then outer-western suburb of Toongabbie, and went to The Meadows Public School and then The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta. He made several short films in his teens including &quot;The Hunter&quot; (1959).

He completed a Bachelor of Arts majoring in English at the University of Sydney, where he graduated in 1964. While at university he made the short film &quot;The Devil to Pay&quot; (1962) starring John Bell and Ron Blair, &quot;It Droppeth as the Gentle Rain&quot; (1963) co-directed by Albie Thoms and starring Germaine Greer, &quot;Clement Meadmore&quot; (1963) with Bell and &quot;King-size Woman&quot; (1965).

==Career==
===Nigeria and England===
Beresford then moved to England in search of film work. He could not break into the British film scene, so he answered an advertisement for an editing job in Nigeria, where he worked for two years, in Enugu.

He then returned to England and worked for the British Film Institute as a producer of short films by first-time directors, including &quot;Magritte: The False Mirror&quot; (1970) and &quot;Paradigm&quot; (1970).

Beresford directed the documentary &quot;Lichtenstein in London&quot; (1968) about Roy Lichtenstein, and &quot;Extravaganza&quot; (1968), &quot;Barbara Hepworth at the Tate&quot; (1970), &quot;The Cinema of Raymond Fark&quot; (1970), and &quot;Arts of Village India&quot; (1972).

===Early feature films===
Beresford returned to Australia to make his first feature film, &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot; (1972), which he also wrote with Barry Humphries. The film, produced by Phillip Adams, was a box office success in England and Australia, but Beresford later said making the film was a &quot;mistake&quot; because reviews were so bad that he had trouble finding other work.

Beresford directed a documentary for TV, &quot;The Wreck of the Batavia&quot; (1973) and did some other TV films, &quot;Poor Fella Me&quot; (1973), and &quot;Monster or Miracle? Sydney Opera House&quot; (1973). These were financed by Reg Grundy who also financed Beresford&#x27;s second feature as director, &quot;Barry McKenzie Holds His Own&quot; (1974), a sequel to &quot;Barry McKenzie&quot;.

Beresford went to England to direct and co-write a comedy, &quot;Side by Side&quot; (1975) starring Humphries and Terry-Thomas and was eventually released on DVD in 2013.

Beresford says his career was at a low ebb when Phillip Adams &quot;saved my life&quot; by offering him the job of directing an acclaimed version of David Williamson&#x27;s play &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot; (1976).

Beresford directed an adaptation of &quot;The Getting of Wisdom&quot; (1977), also produced by Adams.

===SAFC===
Beresford signed a contract with the South Australian Film Corporation for whom he wrote and directed a thriller, &quot;Money Movers&quot; (1979), which was a box office disappointment. He did some uncredited directing on the SAFC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Fin&quot; (1978), then co-wrote and directed &quot;Breaker Morant&quot; (1980). The latter film was a notable success at the box office and earned Beresford an Oscar nomination. It was widely seen in Hollywood and Beresford began to receive US offers.

Beresford directed &quot;The Club&quot; (1980), from another Williamson play, and &quot;Puberty Blues&quot; (1981).

===Early US films===
Beresford received an offer from EMI Films to direct Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;Tender Mercies&quot; (1983). Star Robert Duvall won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance and Beresford earned a Best Director nomination.

He followed it with &quot;King David&quot; (1985) starring Richard Gere, which was a notable box office failure.

Beresford returned to Australia to direct &quot;The Fringe Dwellers&quot; (1986), co-written with his first wife, Rhoisin Beresford. In the US he directed &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot; (1986) from the play by Beth Henley, did a segment of the film &quot;Aria&quot; (1987), and did the comedy thriller &quot;Her Alibi&quot; (1989) with Tom Selleck.

===&quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;===
Beresford directed &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989) with Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy, based on the play by Alfred Uhry. It won the Academy Award for Best Picture, although Beresford was not nominated as director. The film was a commercial and critical success.

Asked if he minded not even being nominated for the Best Director Oscar for &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, Beresford said: &quot;No, not at all. I didn&#x27;t think it was that well directed. It was very well written. When the writing&#x27;s that good, you&#x27;ve really just got to set the camera up and photograph it.&quot;

He directed &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; (1990) in Nigeria, with Edward Woodward; &quot;Black Robe&quot; (1991), an Australian-Canadian film based on the novel by Brian Moore; &quot;Rich in Love&quot; (1992), co-written by Uhry; &quot;A Good Man in Africa&quot; (1994) with Sean Connery from a novel by William Boyd, which in 2015 Beresford called his worst film; &quot;Silent Fall&quot; (1994), which was nominated for the Golden Bear at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival; and &quot;Last Dance&quot; (1996) with Sharon Stone.

He adapted but did not direct &quot;Curse of the Starving Class&quot; (1994).

Beresford returned to Australia to direct &quot;Paradise Road&quot; (1997), which was a commercial disappointment. He directed a documentary, &quot;Sydney: A Story of a City&quot; (1999), then had a hit with the thriller &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; (1999).

===Later films===
Beresford made &quot;Bride of the Wind&quot; (2001); &quot;Evelyn&quot; (2002) with Pierce Brosnan; and &quot;And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself&quot; (2003) with Antonio Banderas.

He spent several years looking for financing for various projects before making &quot;The Contract&quot; (2006) with Freeman and Cusack.

<text>The reed cormorant (Microcarbo africanus), also known as the long-tailed cormorant, is a bird in the cormorant family Phalacrocoracidae. It breeds in much of Africa south of the Sahara, and Madagascar. It is resident but undertakes some seasonal movements.

==Taxonomy==
The reed cormorant was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus africanus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;African shag&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The reed cormorant is now one of five small cormorants placed in the genus &quot;Microcarbo&quot; that was introduced in 1856 by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;M. a. africanus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – inland and coastal Sub-Saharan Africa
* &quot;M. a. pictilis&quot; (Bangs, 1918) – Madagascar (mainly west)

==Description==

This is a small cormorant, in overall length with a wingspan of . It is mainly black, glossed green, in the breeding season. The wing coverts are silvery. It has a longish tail, a short head crest and a red or yellow face patch. The bill is yellow.

The sexes are similar, but non-breeding adults and juveniles are browner, with a white belly. Some southern races retain the crest all year round.

==Distribution and habitat==
This is a common and widespread species, and is not considered to be threatened. It breeds on freshwater wetlands or quiet coasts.

==Behaviour==
The reed cormorant can dive to considerable depths, but usually feeds in shallow water. It frequently brings prey to the surface. It takes a wide variety of fish. It prefers small slow-moving fish, and those with long and tapering shapes, such as mormyrids, catfishes, and cichlids. It will less frequently eat soles (which can be important in its diet locally), frogs, aquatic invertebrates, and small birds.

Two to four eggs are laid in a nest in a tree or on the ground, normally hidden from view by long grass.

<doc id="571080" wikidata="Q3138797" url="?curid=571080" title="Very Short Introductions">
<text>Very Short Introductions (VSI) is a book series published by the Oxford University Press (OUP). The books are concise introductions to particular subjects, intended for a general audience but written by experts. Most are under 200-pages long. While authors may present personal viewpoints, the books are meant to be &quot;balanced and complete&quot; as well as thought provoking.

The series began in 1995, and by March 2023 there were 730 titles, published or announced. The books have been commercially successful, and have been published in more than 25 languages. Institutions can subscribe to an online service to allow their users to read the books.

Most of the books have been written specifically for the series, but around 60 were recycled from earlier OUP publications: several had been in OUP&#x27;s &quot;Past Masters&quot; series, and numbers 17–24 used chapters from &quot;The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain&quot; (1984).

Each book of the series is numbered on its spine. These numbers broadly, but not exactly, correspond with the publication dates. Two books have been removed from the series: #60, &quot;Shakespeare&quot; by Germaine Greer was replaced by &quot;William Shakespeare&quot; by Stanley Wells; and #116, &quot;Anarchism&quot; by Colin Ward was replaced by &quot;Anarchism&quot; by Alex Prichard.

==Reception==
Writing in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; in 2017, Kathryn Schulz praised the diversity of topics covered but noted significant gaps in coverage, including an absence of women and people of colour in its 54 biographies and &quot;a British bias in the choice of subjects&quot;. Schulz also described the quality of the books as variable, favourably comparing the books written about &quot;Teeth&quot;, &quot;Deserts&quot; and &quot;Robotics&quot; against those written on &quot;Mountains&quot;, &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Archaeology&quot;.

In the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, Michelene Wandor said that the series &quot;successfully bridged the gap between academic and trade publishing&quot; and reviewed six volumes.

<text>The Indian cormorant or Indian shag (Phalacrocorax fuscicollis) is a member of the cormorant family. It is found mainly along the inland waters of the Indian Subcontinent but extends west to Sind and east to Thailand and Cambodia. It is a gregarious species that can be easily distinguished from the similar sized little cormorant by its blue eyes, small head with a sloping forehead and a long narrow bill ending in a hooked tip.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian cormorant was formally described in 1826 by English naturalist James Francis Stephens and given the current binomial name &quot;Phalacrocorax fuscicollis&quot;. The specific epithet combines the Latin &quot;fuscus&quot; meaning &quot;dusky&quot; or &quot;brown&quot; with the Modern Latin &quot;-collis&quot; meaning &quot;-necked&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that the Indian cormorant was sister to the little black cormorant. It is estimated that the two species split 2.5–3.2 million years ago during the late Pliocene.

==Description==
This medium-sized bronze brown cormorant is scalloped in black on the upper plumage, lacks a crest and has a small and slightly peaked head with a long narrow bill that ends in a hooked tip. The eyes are blue and it has bare yellow facial skin during the non-breeding season. Breeding birds have a short white ear tuft. In some plumages it has a white throat but the white is restricted below the gape unlike in the much larger great cormorant. Sexes are similar, but non-breeding adults and juveniles are browner.

==Distribution and habitat==
This cormorant fishes gregariously in inland rivers or large wetlands of peninsular India and the northern part of Sri Lanka. It also occurs in estuaries and mangroves but not on the open coast. They breed very locally in mixed species breeding colonies. They extend north-east to Assam and eastward into Thailand, Burma and Cambodia.

==Behaviour==

The breeding season is July to February but depends on rainfall and water conditions. In northern India, they breed from July to February and in Sri Lanka, between November and February. The nest is a platform of twigs placed in the forks of partially submerged trees or of those growing on the islands. The nests are similar to those of other Indian cormorants, storks or waterbirds in dense colonies, often with several tiers of nests. The usual clutch is three to five eggs which are bluish green and with a chalky surface.

The Indian cormorant makes short dives to capture the fish and a group will often fish communally, forming a broad front to drive fish into a corner.

An echinostomatid parasite has been described from Sindh from this species.

<text>A penthouse is an apartment or unit traditionally on the highest floor of an apartment building, condominium, hotel, or tower. Penthouses are typically differentiated from other apartments by luxury features. The term &#x27;penthouse&#x27; originally referred, and sometimes still does refer, to a separate smaller &#x27;house&#x27; that was constructed on the roof of an apartment building. Architecturally it refers specifically to a structure on the roof of a building that is set back from its outer walls. These structures do not have to occupy the entire roof deck. Recently, luxury high rise apartment buildings have begun to designate multiple units on the entire top residential floor or multiple higher residential floors including the top floor as penthouse apartments, and outfit them to include ultra-luxury fixtures, finishes, and designs which are different from all other residential floors of the building. These penthouse apartments are not typically set back from the building&#x27;s outer walls, but are instead flush with the rest of the building and simply differ in size, luxury, and consequently price. High-rise buildings can also have structures known as mechanical penthouses that enclose machinery or equipment such as the drum mechanisms for an elevator.

==Etymology==
The name penthouse is derived from , an Old French word meaning &quot;attached building&quot; or &quot;appendage&quot;. The modern spelling is influenced by a 16th-century folk etymology that combines the Middle French word for &quot;slope&quot; () with the English noun &quot;house&quot; (the meaning at that time was &quot;attached building with a sloping roof or awning&quot;).

==Development==
European designers and architects long recognized the potential in creating living spaces that could make use of rooftops and such setbacks. Penthouses first appeared in US cities in the 1920s with the exploitation of roof spaces for upscale property. The first recognized development was atop the Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park in New York City in 1923. Its success caused a rapid development of similar luxury penthouse apartments in most major cities in the United States in the following years.

The popularity of penthouses stemmed from the setbacks allowing for significantly larger private outdoor terrace spaces than traditional cantilevered balconies. Due to the desirability of having outdoor space, buildings began to be designed with setbacks that could accommodate the development of apartments and terraces on their uppermost levels. 
Modern penthouses may or may not have terraces. Upper floor space may be divided among several apartments, or a single apartment may occupy an entire floor. Penthouses often have their own private access where access to any roof, terrace, and any adjacent setback is exclusively controlled.

==Design==

Penthouses can also differentiate themselves by luxurious amenities such as high-end appliances, finest materials fitting, luxurious flooring system, and more.

Features not found in the majority of apartments in the building may include a private entrance or elevator, or higher/vaulted ceilings. In buildings consisting primarily of single level apartments, penthouse apartments may be distinguished by having two or more levels. They may also have such features as a terrace, fireplace, more floor area, oversized windows, multiple master suites, den/office space, hot-tubs, and more. They might be equipped with luxury kitchens featuring stainless steel appliances, granite counter-tops, breakfast bar/island, and more.

Penthouse residents often have fine views of the city skyline. Access to a penthouse apartment is usually provided by a separate elevator. Residents can also access a number of building services, such as pickup and delivery of everything from dry cleaning to dinner; reservations to restaurants and events made by building staffers; and other concierge services.

Penthouse apartments can also be situated on the corner of a building, providing 90° or more views of the surrounding skyline.

==Cultural references==
Penthouse apartments are considered to be at the top of their markets, and are generally the most expensive, with expansive views, large living spaces, and top-of-the-line amenities. Accordingly, they are often associated with a luxury lifestyle. Publisher Bob Guccione named his magazine &quot;&quot;Penthouse&quot;&quot;, with the trademark phrase &quot;Life on top&quot;.

<text>The little cormorant (Microcarbo niger) is a member of the cormorant family of seabirds. Slightly smaller than the Indian cormorant it lacks a peaked head and has a shorter beak. It is widely distributed across the Indian Subcontinent and extends east to Java, where it is sometimes called the Javanese cormorant. It forages singly or sometimes in loose groups in lowland freshwater bodies, including small ponds, large lakes, streams and sometimes coastal estuaries. Like other cormorants, it is often found perched on a waterside rock with its wings spread out after coming out of the water. The entire body is black in the breeding season but the plumage is brownish, and the throat has a small whitish patch in the non-breeding season. These birds breed gregariously in trees, often joining other waterbirds at heronries.

==Description==
The little cormorant is about long and only slightly smaller than the Indian cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax fuscicollis&quot;). The Indian cormorant has a narrower and longer bill which ends in a prominent hook tip, blue iris and a more pointed head profile. The breeding adult bird has a glistening all black plumage with some white spots and filoplumes on the face. There is also a short crest on the back of the head. The eyes, gular skin and face are dark. In the non-breeding bird or juvenile, the plumage is brownish and the bill and gular skin can appear more fleshy. The crest becomes inconspicuous and a small and well-marked white patch on the throat is sometimes visible. Towards the west of the Indus River valley, its range can overlap with vagrant pygmy cormorants (&quot;Microcarbo pygmaeus&quot;), which can be difficult to differentiate in the field and are sometimes even considered conspecific. The sexes are indistinguishable in the field, but males tend to be larger. Some abnormal silvery-grey plumages have been described.

The species was described by Vieillot in 1817 as &quot;Hydrocorax niger&quot;. The genus &quot;Hydrocorax&quot; literally means water crow. It was later included with the other cormorants in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; but some studies place the smaller &quot;microcormorants&quot; under the genus &quot;Microcarbo&quot;.

==Distribution==
The little cormorant is found across India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and lowland Nepal. It is also found in parts of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Indonesia. It is not found in the Himalayas, but vagrants have been seen in Ladakh. It inhabits wetlands, ranging from small village ponds to large lakes, and sometimes tidal estuaries.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Little cormorants tend to forage mainly in small loose groups and are often seen foraging alone. They swim underwater to capture their prey, mainly fish. A study in northern India found that the little cormorant fished in water which was less than a metre deep and captured fishes of about length. They propel themselves underwater using their webbed feet. Captured fishes are often brought up to the surface to swallow them and during this time other birds including other little cormorants, painted storks, gulls and egrets may attempt to steal them. Indian cormorants tend to fish communally in larger groups. Like all other cormorants, they will emerge from water and will hold out their wings and stay immobile for a while. The behaviour has been suggested to be for wing-drying, but this interpretation is debated. A study in Sri Lanka found that the time spent with spread wings was always after they had spent some time underwater, and that the duration was related to time spent underwater and inversely related to the temperature and dryness of air. These observations support the theory that the studied behaviour aids drying of the wings.

The breeding season of the little cormorant is between July and September in Pakistan and northern India and between November and February in southern India. In Sri Lanka it is December to May. A study in Bangladesh found them to breed from May to October. Males display at the nest site by fluttering their wings while holding their head back and bill raised. They then lower the bill, and after pairing the male also provides food to the female in courtship feeding. Both parents take part in building the nest, which is a platform of sticks placed on trees and sometimes even on coconut palms. They may nest beside Indian pond herons and little egrets in colonies. The nest is built in about two weeks. The whitish eggs turn muddy with age and incubation begins when the first egg is laid. This leads to asynchronous hatching and the chicks in a nest can vary considerably in age. The clutch size can vary from two to six eggs laid at intervals of about two days. The eggs hatch after 15 to 21 days. The downy chicks have a bare red head. The young birds are able to leave the nest after about a month.

Little cormorants are vocal near their nest and roosts where they produce low roaring sounds. They also produce grunts and groans, a low pitched &quot;ah-ah-ah&quot; and &quot;kok-kok-kok&quot; calls. They roost communally often in the company of other waterbirds.

Parasitic bird lice, &quot;Pectinopygus makundi&quot;, have been described from little cormorant hosts. Endoparasitic helminths, &quot;Hymenolepis childi&quot; and &quot;Dilepis lepidocolpos&quot; have been described from Sri Lankan birds while others like &quot;Neocotylotretus udaipurensis&quot; and &quot;Syncuaria buckleyi&quot; have been described from Indian birds.

<text>Kale (), also called leaf cabbage, belongs to a group of cabbage (&quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;) cultivars primarily grown for their edible leaves; it has also been used as an ornamental plant.

== Description ==
Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage). The stems can be white or red, and can be tough even when cooked.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;kale&quot; originates from Northern Middle English &quot;cale&quot; (compare Scots &quot;kail&quot; and German &quot;Kohl&quot;) for various cabbages. The ultimate origin is Latin &quot;caulis&quot; &#x27;cabbage&#x27;.

== Cultivation ==
Derived from wild mustard, kale is considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most domesticated forms of &quot;B. oleracea&quot;.

Kale is usually a biennial plant grown from seed with a wide range of germination temperatures. It is hardy and thrives in wintertime, and can survive in temperatures as low as . Kale can become sweeter after a heavy frost.

=== History ===

Kale originated in the eastern Mediterranean and Anatolia, where it was cultivated for food beginning by 2000 BCE at the latest. Curly-leaved varieties of cabbage already existed along with flat-leaved varieties in Greece in the 4th century BC. These forms, which were referred to by the Romans as Sabellian kale, are considered to be the ancestors of modern kales.

The earliest record of cabbages in western Europe is of hard-heading cabbage in the 13th century. Records in 14th-century England distinguish between hard-heading cabbage and loose-leaf kale.

Russian traders introduced Russian kale into Canada and then into the United States in the 19th century. USDA botanist David Fairchild is credited with introducing kale (and many other crops) to Americans, having brought it back from Croatia, although Fairchild himself disliked cabbages, including kale. At the time, kale was widely grown in Croatia mostly because it was easy to grow and inexpensive, and could desalinate soil.

=== Cultivars ===
One may differentiate between kale varieties according to the low, intermediate, or high length of the stem, along with the variety of leaf types. The leaf colours range from light green to green, dark green, violet-green, and violet-brown.

Classification by leaf type:
* Curly-leaf (Scots kale, blue curled kale)
* Bumpy-leaf (black cabbage, better known by its Italian translation &#x27;cavolo nero&#x27;, and also known as Tuscan Cabbage, Tuscan Kale, lacinato and dinosaur kale)
* Sparkly-leaf (shiny and glossy)
* Plain-leaf (flat-leaf types like red Russian and white Russian kale)
* Leaf and spear, or feathery-type leaf (a cross between curly- and plain-leaf)
*Ornamental (less palatable and tougher leaves)
Because kale can grow well into winter, one variety of &quot;rape kale&quot; is called &quot;hungry gap&quot; after the period in winter in traditional agriculture when little else could be harvested. An extra-tall variety is known as &quot;Jersey kale&quot; or &quot;cow cabbage&quot;. &quot;Kai-lan&quot; or &quot;Chinese kale&quot; is a cultivar often used in Chinese cuisine. In Portugal, the bumpy-leaved kale is mostly called &quot;couve galega&quot; (Galician kale or Portuguese Cabbage).

==== Ornamental kale ====
Many varieties of kale and cabbage are grown mainly for ornamental leaves that are brilliant white, red, pink, lavender, blue, or violet in the interior of the rosette. The different types of ornamental kale are peacock kale, coral prince, kamone coral queen, color up kale, and chidori kale. &quot;Ornamental kale&quot; is as edible as any other variety, but potentially not as palatable. Kale leaves are increasingly used as an ingredient for vegetable bouquets and wedding bouquets.

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===

Raw kale is composed of 84% water, 9% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and 1% fat (table). In a serving, raw kale provides of food energy and a large amount of vitamin K at 3.7 times the Daily Value (DV). It is a rich source (20% or more of the DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, and manganese (see table &quot;Kale, raw&quot;). Kale is a good source (10–19% DV) of thiamin, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, vitamin E, and several dietary minerals, including iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. Boiling raw kale diminishes most of these nutrients, while values for vitamins A, C, and K and manganese remain substantial.

===Phytochemicals===
Kale is a source of the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin. As with broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, kale contains glucosinolate compounds, such as glucoraphanin, which contributes to the formation of sulforaphane, a compound under preliminary research for its potential to affect human health beneficially.

Boiling kale decreases the level of glucosinate compounds, whereas steaming, microwaving, or stir frying does not cause significant loss. Kale is high in oxalic acid, the levels of which can be reduced by cooking.

Kale contains high levels of polyphenols, such as ferulic acid, with levels varying due to environmental and genetic factors.

=== Culinary ===

==== Snack product ====

Kale chips have been produced as a potato chip substitute.

==== Regional uses ====

===== Europe =====
In the Netherlands, a traditional winter dish called &quot;boerenkoolstamppot&quot; is a mix of curly kale and mashed potatoes, sometimes with fried bacon, and served with rookworst (&quot;smoked sausage&quot;).

In Northern Germany, there is a winter tradition known as &quot;Kohlfahrt&quot; (&quot;kale trip&quot;), where a group of people will go on a hike through the woods during the day before gathering at an inn or private residence where kale is served, usually with bacon and Kohlwurst (&quot;kale sausage&quot;). Kale is considered a Northern German staple and comfort food.

In Italy, cavolo nero kale is an ingredient of the Tuscan soup ribollita.

A traditional Portuguese soup, &quot;caldo verde&quot;, combines pureed potatoes, very finely sliced kale, olive oil and salt. Additional ingredients can include broth and sliced, cooked spicy sausage.

In Scotland, kale provided such a base for a traditional diet that the word in some Scots dialects is synonymous with food. To be &quot;off one&#x27;s kail&quot; is to feel too ill to eat.

In Ireland, kale is mixed with mashed potatoes to make the traditional dish &quot;colcannon&quot;. It is popular on Halloween, when it may be served with sausages.

In the United Kingdom, the cultivation of kale (and other vegetables) was encouraged during World War II via the Dig for Victory campaign. The vegetable was easy to grow and provided important nutrients missing from a diet because of rationing.

===== Asia =====
In Sri Lanka, it is known as &quot;kola gova&quot; or ela gova. It is cultivated for edible use. A dish called &#x27;kale mallung&#x27; is served almost everywhere on the island, along with rice.

===== United States =====
For most of the 20th century, kale was primarily used in the U.S. for decorative purposes; it became more popular as an edible vegetable in the 1990s due to its nutritional value.

== In culture ==
The &quot;Kailyard&quot; school of Scottish writers, which included J. M. Barrie (creator of Peter Pan), consisted of authors who wrote about traditional rural Scottish life (&quot;kailyard&quot; = &#x27;kale field&#x27;). In Cuthbertson&#x27;s book &quot;Autumn in Kyle and the charm of Cunninghame&quot;, he states that Kilmaurs in East Ayrshire was famous for its kale, which was an important foodstuff. A story is told in which a neighbouring village offered to pay a generous price for some kale seeds, an offer too good to turn down. The locals agreed, but a gentle roasting on a shovel over a coal fire ensured the seeds never germinated.

<text>Kale , also known as &#x27;, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered in 2001 by astronomers Scott S. Sheppard, D. Jewitt, and J. Kleyna, and was originally designated as &#x27;.

Kale is about in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of in 736.55 days, at an inclination of 165° to the ecliptic (166° to Jupiter&#x27;s equator), in a retrograde direction and with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2011.

It was named in August 2003 after Kale, one of the Charites (, , &#x27;Graces&#x27;), daughters of Zeus (Jupiter). Kale is the spouse of Hephaestus according to some authors (although most have Aphrodite play that role).

It belongs to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between and at an inclination of about 165°.

<doc id="571109" wikidata="Q1192869" url="?curid=571109" title="Dirichlet problem">
<text>In mathematics, a Dirichlet problem asks for a function which solves a specified partial differential equation (PDE) in the interior of a given region that takes prescribed values on the boundary of the region.

The Dirichlet problem can be solved for many PDEs, although originally it was posed for Laplace&#x27;s equation. In that case the problem can be stated as follows:

:Given a function &quot;f&quot; that has values everywhere on the boundary of a region in formula_1, is there a unique continuous function formula_2 twice continuously differentiable in the interior and continuous on the boundary, such that formula_2 is harmonic in the interior and formula_4 on the boundary?

This requirement is called the Dirichlet boundary condition. The main issue is to prove the existence of a solution; uniqueness can be proven using the maximum principle.

==History==

The Dirichlet problem goes back to George Green, who studied the problem on general domains with general boundary conditions in his &quot;Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, published in 1828. He reduced the problem into a problem of constructing what we now call Green&#x27;s functions, and argued that Green&#x27;s function exists for any domain. His methods were not rigorous by today&#x27;s standards, but the ideas were highly influential in the subsequent developments. The next steps in the study of the Dirichlet&#x27;s problem were taken by Karl Friedrich Gauss, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, after whom the problem was named, and the solution to the problem (at least for the ball) using the Poisson kernel was known to Dirichlet (judging by his 1850 paper submitted to the Prussian academy). Lord Kelvin and Dirichlet suggested a solution to the problem by a variational method based on the minimization of &quot;Dirichlet&#x27;s energy&quot;. According to Hans Freudenthal (in the &quot;Dictionary of Scientific Biography&quot;, vol. 11), Bernhard Riemann was the first mathematician who solved this variational problem based on a method which he called Dirichlet&#x27;s principle. The existence of a unique solution is very plausible by the &quot;physical argument&quot;: any charge distribution on the boundary should, by the laws of electrostatics, determine an electrical potential as solution. However, Karl Weierstrass found a flaw in Riemann&#x27;s argument, and a rigorous proof of existence was found only in 1900 by David Hilbert, using his direct method in the calculus of variations. It turns out that the existence of a solution depends delicately on the smoothness of the boundary and the prescribed data.

==General solution==
For a domain formula_5 having a sufficiently smooth boundary formula_6, the general solution to the Dirichlet problem is given by

: formula_7

where formula_8 is the Green&#x27;s function for the partial differential equation, and

: formula_9

is the derivative of the Green&#x27;s function along the inward-pointing unit normal vector formula_10. The integration is performed on the boundary, with measure formula_11. The function formula_12 is given by the unique solution to the Fredholm integral equation of the second kind,

: formula_13

The Green&#x27;s function to be used in the above integral is one which vanishes on the boundary:

: formula_14

for formula_15 and formula_16. Such a Green&#x27;s function is usually a sum of the free-field Green&#x27;s function and a harmonic solution to the differential equation.

===Existence===
The Dirichlet problem for harmonic functions always has a solution, and that solution is unique, when the boundary is sufficiently smooth and formula_17 is continuous. More precisely, it has a solution when

: formula_18

for some formula_19, where formula_20 denotes the Hölder condition.

==Example: the unit disk in two dimensions==
In some simple cases the Dirichlet problem can be solved explicitly. For example, the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the unit disk in R2 is given by the Poisson integral formula.

If formula_21 is a continuous function on the boundary formula_6 of the open unit disk formula_5, then the solution to the Dirichlet problem is formula_24 given by

: formula_25

The solution formula_2 is continuous on the closed unit disk formula_27 and harmonic on formula_28

The integrand is known as the Poisson kernel; this solution follows from the Green&#x27;s function in two dimensions:

: formula_29

where formula_30 is harmonic (formula_31) and chosen such that formula_32 for formula_33.

==Methods of solution==
For bounded domains, the Dirichlet problem can be solved using the Perron method, which relies on the maximum principle for subharmonic functions. This approach is described in many text books. It is not well-suited to describing smoothness of solutions when the boundary is smooth. Another classical Hilbert space approach through Sobolev spaces does yield such information. The solution of the Dirichlet problem using Sobolev spaces for planar domains can be used to prove the smooth version of the Riemann mapping theorem. has outlined a different approach for establishing the smooth Riemann mapping theorem, based on the reproducing kernels of Szegő and Bergman, and in turn used it to solve the Dirichlet problem. The classical methods of potential theory allow the Dirichlet problem to be solved directly in terms of integral operators, for which the standard theory of compact and Fredholm operators is applicable. The same methods work equally for the Neumann problem.

==Generalizations==
Dirichlet problems are typical of elliptic partial differential equations, and potential theory, and the Laplace equation in particular. Other examples include the biharmonic equation and related equations in elasticity theory.

They are one of several types of classes of PDE problems defined by the information given at the boundary, including Neumann problems and Cauchy problems.

==Example: equation of a finite string attached to one moving wall==

Consider the Dirichlet problem for the wave equation describing a string attached between walls with one end attached permanently and the other moving with the constant velocity i.e. the d&#x27;Alembert equation on the triangular region of the Cartesian product of the space and the time:
: formula_34
: formula_35
: formula_36

As one can easily check by substitution, the solution fulfilling the first condition is
: formula_37

Additionally we want
: formula_38

Substituting

: formula_39

we get the condition of self-similarity

: formula_40

where

: formula_41

It is fulfilled, for example, by the composite function
: formula_42

with

: formula_43

thus in general

: formula_44

where formula_45 is a periodic function with a period formula_46:

: formula_47

and we get the general solution

: formula_48

<text>This is a survey of the postage stamps and postal history of New South Wales, a former British colony now part of Australia.

==Pre-stamp era==
New South Wales was the first part of Australia to be settled by Europeans, and the first to operate a postal service, which in 1803 was carrying letters between Sydney and Parramatta for a 2d charge. In 1809 a collecting office in Sydney was established to receive mail from passing ships, and in 1825 the postal service was expanded. Mail coach service began in 1830, and in 1835 a new Postage Act superseded the 1825 statute and set rates based on weight and distance travelled.

The postmaster of the time, James Raymond, was in communication with Rowland Hill in England and worked to encourage the prepayment of letters in NSW. In 1838, Raymond introduced envelopes embossed with the seal of the colony, and available for local mail for 1¼ pence each instead of the 2d charged letters paid for in cash. They are thus regarded as precursors of the Penny Black. However, the envelopes were not popular, and in 1841 Raymond was unable to develop official interest in postage stamps for the colony.

==First stamps==

In 1842 regular mail service was carried by steamer between Melbourne and Sydney, and the first mail packet from Britain arrived in 1844. An act of 1848 reformed the postal system and authorised the use of stamps; the first stamps appeared on 1 January 1850. They were locally produced, and depicted a scene of Sydney and its harbour, thus becoming known as the &quot;Sydney Views&quot;. The 1d, 2d, and 3d stamps were separately engraved, and then re-engraved and retouched over the next year, yielding dozens of varieties.

In 1851 the colony switched to a more conventional design, a profile of Queen Victoria wearing a laurel wreath, first in a somewhat crude rendition, then a better one in 1853. The colony also took the unusual step of using paper watermarked with the denomination, a practice that resulted in a number of mismatches between watermark and printed denomination that are rare and highly prized today.

In 1854 the colony issued 6d and 1/- stamps printed locally, from plates engraved by Perkins Bacon in England. These were large square stamps with the standard profile of Victoria wearing a diadem, framed with a hexagon and octagon respectively. The designs were reused for 5d and 8d in 1855.

In 1856 a Perkins Bacon design was also adopted for the lower values as well. The inking of all these was highly variable, and there are dozens of distinct colour varieties. The use of perforation began in 1860; unfortunately for collectors, the stamps were very closely spaced, the perforating process not well controlled, and it is unusual to find stamps from before 1899 where the perforation does not touch or cut into the design on one or more sides.
The first 5-shilling stamp was issued in 1861, and it was notable for being a round design resembling a medallion. In 1861, new designs were created by De La Rue and printed both in London and the colony.

In 1871 a watermark reading &quot;NSW&quot; surmounted by a crown began to replace the numerals, and in 1885 a need for high-values prompted the overprinting of 5/-, 10/-, and one-pound revenue stamps with &quot;POSTAGE&quot;.
New South Wales celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1888 with an issue of what is widely considered to be the first commemorative stamps. The set of eight, each with a different design, were all inscribed &quot;ONE HUNDRED YEARS&quot;. Among the designs were a view of Sydney, an emu, Captain Cook, a lyrebird, and a kangaroo. The 20/- value included portraits of both Arthur Phillip the first governor, and the then-governor Lord Carrington.

A 2½d stamp depicting an allegorical figure of Australia appeared in 1890, while ½d, 7½d, and 12½d values were produced in 1891 as surcharges on existing stamps.
In 1897 two early semi-postal stamps were issued, paying 1d and 2½d rates, but sold for 1/- and 2/6 respectively, the additional proceeds going to a Consumptives&#x27; Home. In the same year a set of three stamps marked Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

The formation of the Commonwealth had no immediate effect on the NSW postal system. Although the new constitution granted the commonwealth power to run a national postal service, unification was not immediate. The systems gradually merged during the 1900s. In 1903 a 9d stamp in two colors (brown and blue) was inscribed &quot;COMMONWEALTH&quot; and mentioned the initials of each member along with its year of founding. In 1905 the stamps began to be printed on paper watermarked with a crown and the letter &quot;A&quot;, with reprintings of existing designs occurring into 1910.

In 1913 the stamps of New South Wales were superseded by those of Australia.

Most of the stamps of New South Wales are readily available today, but it is somewhat complex to collect; there are a dozen types of watermarks, multiple perforations, and numerous colour shades. While the Scott catalog distinguishes about 200 major types, it calls out many more minor varieties, and the Stanley Gibbons catalog totals some 400 distinct varieties.

== Numeral cancellations ==
Numeral cancellations on New South Wales postage stamps are also of interest to collectors. Ninety-six post offices had already been opened when the first postage stamps were issued on 1 January 1850. Numeral obliterators were allocated to these post offices to cancel stamps on outgoing mail. Sydney itself had no number and used dumb obliterators. The first allotment of numbers was based on the pattern of roads radiating outward from Sydney.

Numerals and obliterators continued to be allocated to opening post offices up to the beginning of 1904 with 2099 (Toolijooa) probably the last number assigned. The patterns of allocation provide a way of tracking the history of settlement of the state, although made complex by re-allocations as post offices closed or jurisdiction was transferred, as happened when Queensland became a separate colony. 

Larger post offices also impressed a date-stamp on covers with the name of the originating office. This means that covers or stamps torn from covers or pairs of stamps can be used to tie numbers to mailing offices where official records are missing. Even so, as many as 300 New South Wales numbers are still untied.

There can be many variations of numeral cancellations depending on the type of obliterator used. The first obliterators allocated had horizontal bars. These were followed by &quot;ray&quot; types. The colour of the ink used might also vary. The Sydney obliterators also exist in many variations. 

Most collectors of numerical cancellations ignore the stamp itself, which may appear upside-down or sideways in albums or stock cards.

== Postal stationery ==
New South Wales issued its own postal stationery until the Commonwealth of Australia stationery was made available in 1911. Envelopes were issued in 1838 for local use within Sydney, New South Wales and were used till 1857. Between 1870 and 1911 eleven different envelopes were produced and issued. Registration envelopes were first made available to the public in 1880 and a total of 14 different were produced. Newspaper wrappers were available from 1864, New South Wales being the second postal administration after the United States to issue newspaper wrappers. A total of 12 different wrappers are known. Letter cards were in use from 1894 and a total of 11 different letter cards were produced. Postcards were available from 1875 and, by the time the Australian Commonwealth postcards were introduced, New South Wales had produced a total of 34 different items.

<text>Société Aircalin, also known as Air Calédonie International, is the flag carrier of the French collectivity of New Caledonia, with its headquarters in Nouméa. It operates scheduled services from its main hub at La Tontouta International Airport to destinations across Oceania and Asia, as well as domestic services in Wallis and Futuna. The airline is 99% owned by the Government of New Caledonia, with the remaining 1% held by minority owners, including the airline&#x27;s employees.

== History ==
The airline was established in September 1983 as &quot;Air Calédonie International&quot;, an international airline to complement New Caledonia&#x27;s domestic airline, Air Calédonie. Between 1983 and 1985, the airline operated flights from Nouméa by leasing aircraft from other airlines including Air Nauru and Qantas. In 1985, the airline acquired a Sud Aviation Caravelle from Corsair, which it used to open routes to Sydney and Auckland until 1988, when the airline replaced the Caravelle with a Boeing 737-300. In 1986, the airline began operating in Asia until 1997 due to the Asian Financial Crisis, specifically operated from Nouméa to Kagoshima via Manila and Hong Kong, shortly after, it began flying to Honolulu from Nouméa via Guam and Wake Island until 1999 due to unprofitability. In 1987, the airline also acquired a de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter to operate services in Wallis and Futuna. In 1996, the airline rebranded as &quot;Aircalin&quot;, unveiling a new corporate image and logo.

In April 2000, Aircalin agreed on a three-year interim lease with Airbus for an Airbus A310-300 previously operated by Swissair as its first widebody aircraft. This allowed the airline to trial the viability of long-haul services, with the airline&#x27;s first long-haul destination being Osaka. The next year, the airline ordered two Airbus A330-200s from Airbus, which were to begin delivery upon the expiration of its Airbus A310 lease. The airline also considered the replacement of its single Boeing 737-300 with an Airbus A320-200. Aircalin&#x27;s first Airbus A330-200 proceeded to begin service in late 2002, replacing the leased Airbus A310, while the second A330-200 allowed the airline to open a new route to Tokyo, taking over Air France&#x27;s service between Tokyo and Nouméa. On 9 February 2004, the airline received its first Airbus A320-200, which replaced its Boeing 737-300.

On 1 July 2014, Aircalin unveiled a new livery with the delivery of its second Airbus A320-200, the livery incorporating shades of blue inspired by New Caledonia&#x27;s lagoon and skies, as well as traditional symbols. In October 2017, the airline ordered two Airbus A320neo and two A330-900 aircraft, with the intent of replacing its two Airbus A320-200 and two A330-200 aircraft. Aircalin&#x27;s first Airbus A330-900 was delivered on 30 July 2019, and the airline subsequently planned the retirement of its Airbus A330-200 operations for September 2019. Following the initial retirement of the airline&#x27;s Airbus A330-200 aircraft, Aircalin returned one of its Airbus A330-900 aircraft to Airbus in November 2019, citing noxious fumes in the cabin during operation, similar to issues reported by TAP Air Portugal for their own A330-900 aircraft. One of the airline&#x27;s A330-200 aircraft was temporarily returned to operation for six weeks, during which the A330-900 was being investigated by Airbus and engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce until December 2019.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Aircalin in May 2020 reported a 93% drop in passenger demand since March 2020, postponed all operations outside of French repatriation flights, and announced plans to cut staffing costs by 20% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations. The airline also announced the suspension of its routes to Melbourne and Osaka from Nouméa, and the postponement of its Airbus A320neo deliveries from 2020 to 2023. The airline initially in July 2020 scheduled the resumption of services to Osaka for March 2021, but flights to Osaka never resumed. Despite previous reports that its Airbus A320neo deliveries would be postponed to 2023, Aircalin accepted its first of two A320neos in December 2020, before retiring its remaining Airbus A320-200s by April 2021.

<text>China Eastern Airlines (branded as China Eastern) is a major airline in China, headquartered in Changning, Shanghai. It is one of the three major airlines in the country, along with Air China and China Southern Airlines.

China Eastern&#x27;s main hubs are Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport both located in Shanghai. In terms of passenger traffic, it is the country&#x27;s second largest airline after China Southern Airlines. In 2021, its operational revenue was 67,127 million RMB with assets totaling 286,548 million RMB. China Eastern (along with its subsidiary Shanghai Airlines) became the 14th member of SkyTeam on June 21, 2011.

==History==
China Eastern Airlines was established on June 25, 1988, under the Civil Aviation Administration of China Huadong Administration. In 1997, China Eastern took over the unprofitable China General Aviation and also became the country&#x27;s first airline to offer shares on the international market. In 1998, it founded China Cargo Airlines in a joint venture with COSCO. In March 2001, it completed the takeover of Great Wall Airlines. China Yunnan Airlines and China Northwest Airlines merged into China Eastern Airlines in 2003. The company slogan is &quot;World-Class Hospitality with Eastern Charm&quot; ().
The Chinese government has a majority ownership stake in China Eastern Airlines (61.64%), while some shares are publicly held (H shares, 32.19%); A shares, 6.17%. On April 20, 2006, the media broke the news of a possible sale of up to 20% of its stake to foreign investors, including Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Japan Airlines, with Singapore Airlines confirming that negotiations were underway.

After receiving approval from the State Council of China, it was announced that on September 2, 2007, Singapore Airlines and Temasek Holdings (holding company which owns 55% of Singapore Airlines) would jointly acquire shares of China Eastern Airlines. On November 9, 2007, investors signed a final agreement to buy a combined 24% stake in China Eastern Airlines: Singapore Airlines would own 15.73% and Temasek Holdings an 8.27% stake in the airline.
Singapore Airlines&#x27; pending entry into the Chinese market prompted the Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific to attempt to block the deal by buying a significant stake in China Eastern and voting down the deal together with Air China (which already held an 11% stake in China Eastern) at the shareholders&#x27; meeting in December 2007. However, on September 24, Cathay Pacific announced that it had abandoned these plans.

Air China&#x27;s parent company, state-owned China National Aviation Corporation, announced in January 2008 that it would offer 32% more than Singapore Airlines for the 24% stake in China Eastern, potentially complicating the deal that Singapore Airlines and Temasek had proposed by Beckett Saufley. However, minority shareholders declined the offer made by Singapore Airlines. It is thought that this was due to the massive effort made by Air China to buy the 24% stake.

On June 11, 2009, it was announced that China Eastern Airlines would merge with Shanghai Airlines. The merger of China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines was expected to reduce excess competition between the two Shanghai-based carriers while consolidating Shanghai&#x27;s status as an international aviation hub. In February 2010, the merger was completed. Shanghai Airlines became a wholly owned subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines. However, Shanghai Airlines retained its brand and livery. The new combined airline was expected to have over half of the market share in Shanghai, the financial hub of China. China Eastern Airlines also acquired China United Airlines in October 2010.

In March 2012, it was announced that China Eastern was forging a strategic alliance with the Qantas Group to set up Jetstar Hong Kong, a new low cost airline to be based at Hong Kong International Airport, which would commence operations in 2013. China Eastern would hold a 50% stake in the new airline, with the Qantas Group holding the other 50%, representing a total investment of US$198 million. However, in June 2015, the Hong Kong Air Transport Licensing Authority refused to issue an operating license to Jetstar Hong Kong. China Eastern and Qantas subsequently announced the end of the investment.

In April 2013, China Eastern received a temporary permit to operate in the Philippines, but the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines required them to obtain a technical permit and an airport slot.

In 2012, China Eastern was awarded the “Golden Ting Award” at the China Capital Market Annual Conference 2012, recognizing it as one of the 50 most valuable Chinese brands by WPP and ranking in the top ten of FORTUNE China&#x27;s CSR ranking 2013.

On September 9, 2014, China Eastern introduced a new logo and new livery. In 2015, the airline entered a partnership with Delta Air Lines in which Delta will buy a 3.55% share in China Eastern for $450 million.

In 2017, China Eastern Airlines reported a net profit of CNY6.4 billion ($983 million), up 41% over net income of CNY4.5 billion in 2016.

On February 26, 2020, China Eastern Airlines launched OTT Airlines as a subsidiary to operate domestically produced aircraft, such as the Comac C919 and Comac ARJ21, in the Yangtze Delta region in addition to business jet operations.

In 2015, they entered into an equity partnership, with Delta investing $450 million for a 3.55% stake in China Eastern. This led to significant achievements, including an expanded network with over 170 city pairs and the launch of Trans-China baggage check-through service. The partnership has brought numerous benefits to both airlines and their customers.

<doc id="571125" wikidata="Q7928300" url="?curid=571125" title="Vienna station (Washington Metro)">
<text>Vienna station is a Washington Metro station on the Orange Line near Fairfax, Virginia. The station is in the median of Interstate 66 at Nutley Street, also known as Virginia State Route 243, near Fairfax.

The station can be accessed from I-66 without merging onto Nutley Street by a series of ramps that transport commuters to the station&#x27;s north and south side parking complexes. From the parking areas, riders use elevated walkways that bridge the east and westbound lanes of I-66 to reach the platform and mezzanine. The station provides easy access to the nearby Town of Vienna, the City of Fairfax, and the main campus of George Mason University. Service began on June 7, 1986.

== History ==
Although originally identified as the western terminus of the Orange Line in the 1968 plan, by 1978, Fairfax County was debating whether the initial terminus should be at the Vienna location or at another location in Tysons. After much public debate and public comment, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors endorsed the Vienna routing. The endorsement was made after determining it would cost an additional $59 million and take another five years to complete the line to Tysons. Metro service to Tysons Corner was later established as part of the Silver Line, which opened in 2014.

The groundbreaking for the station took place on September 8, 1982. At the time, the final facility was to have cost $17.6 million with parking for 2,000 vehicles. After nearly four years of construction, the station opened on June 7, 1986, as the western terminus of the Orange Line. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail from the station and the opening of the , , and stations.

By 1993, officials in Fairfax City were looking to add &quot;Fairfax&quot; to the station name. In March 1999, the station name was changed to Vienna/Fairfax–GMU, which was misleading because a drive or ride on an infrequent CUE Bus or Metrobus is required to reach Fairfax City and GMU.
In November 2011, the Metro Board adopted guidelines limiting station names to nineteen characters. Stations with longer names were split in two: Vienna&#x27;s &quot;primary name&quot; returned to &quot;Vienna&quot; and &quot;Fairfax–GMU&quot; became a &quot;secondary name&quot; on Metro maps.
In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platforms at the Vienna station would be rebuilt starting in mid-2020.

From May 23 until September 7, 2020, this station was closed due to the platform reconstruction project, which closed stations west of Ballston–MU.

On June 3, 2023, this station was closed for track replacement, affecting stations west of Ballston–MU. Service resumed on July 17, 2023.

On June 22, 2024, many Fairfax Connector bus routes to points west (Centreville, Chantilly, Fair Oaks, and Penderbrook) stopped serving the station as part of the agency&#x27;s CCVT (Centreville-Chantilly-Vienna-Tysons) Phase 1 service changes. Many of them were canceled or changed to end at the new Monument Drive Transit Center, with express/limited-stop routes 660/663/671 (weekday peak hours) and 662/672 (all other times) providing all replacement service between Monument Drive Transit Center and Vienna at higher frequencies than before. Some passengers can also transfer between routes at Stone Road and Stringfellow Road.

== Transit-oriented development ==
In line with high-density development, the Fairlee Metro-West project aims to increase the housing density around the Vienna station from 60 single-family homes to 2,250 condominiums and townhouses. This development has been controversial, as many Orange Line commuters believe the system will be pushed beyond capacity during rush hours. As of May 2009, the project is under construction.

==Station Layout==
The Vienna station consists of a single island platform located in the median of the I-66 freeway, with a mezzanine containing fare gates and other station equipment located above the platform. Track K1 is the nominal eastbound track, while K2 is the nominal westbound track. As the western terminal of the Orange Line, trains utilize a crossover just east of the platform to access whichever track is open when approaching and to switch onto the eastbound K1 track when departing. Access to the station is via two bridges crossing the freeway to the north and south, serving bus bays and parking garages on both sides of the station. Tail tracks extend a considerable length to the west of the station, used both as train storage and as a provision for a future western extension.

<doc id="571128" wikidata="Q572179" url="?curid=571128" title="Kult (band)">
<text>Kult is a Polish rock band formed in 1982 in Warsaw.

Kult&#x27;s early works were strongly influenced by alternative, progressive and punk rock, as well as the British new wave, but the band gradually incorporated more diverse and innovative styles in their music. The music of the band is primarily associated with strong lyrics by Staszewski and distinct wind section. From the start, the group has had an instantly recognizable sound and is distinguished by the voice and provocative lyrics of the lead singer, Kazik Staszewski.

Kult became famous for the atmosphere they created at their concerts and the unorthodox message in their songs. Kult&#x27;s songs attack &#x27;the system&#x27;, understood as a conglomerate of the communist state apparatus, the Catholic Church, and others. In the nineties Kult took on the &#x27;new system&#x27;, which was seen as founded on pseudo-democratic leaders, the clergy and corporations.

== History ==

Before forming the band, all members of the original quartet had been playing together in either Poland or Novelty Poland, two bands led by Staszewski between 1979 and 1981. In July 1982 the band performed at its first concert at the Remont Club in Warsaw. The first concert of the new band in July 1982 sold only 14 tickets. However, in 1986 the band recorded its first album (named eponymously &quot;Kult&quot;; released the following year), which attracted much attention and included early punk-inspired hits &quot;Krew Boga&quot;, &quot;O Ani&quot; and &quot;Wspaniała nowina&quot;. Initially the censorship office did not allow for release of many songs by Staszewski, clearly aimed against &quot;the system&quot;. Also in 1987 a second album, the slightly more psychedelic &quot;Posłuchaj to do Ciebie&quot; was released. Since then the band gained much popularity in Poland, with songs such as &quot;Do Ani&quot;, &quot;Arahja&quot; and &quot;Krew Boga&quot; reaching #1 on Polish Radio 3 chart (LP3).

After 1989 and the end of Communist rule in Poland Kult enjoyed great success, with each of a series of albums bringing new hits to the tops of the radio charts. The &quot;Generał Ferreira / Rząd oficjalny&quot; from the 1991 album &quot;Your Eyes&quot; reached No. 1 on LP3 and stayed in the Top20 for 33 consecutive weeks. &quot;Dziewczyna bez zęba na przedzie&quot;, &quot;Komu bije dzwon&quot;, &quot;Gdy nie ma dzieci&quot; and &quot;Lewy czerwcowy&quot; (from the 1998 album &quot;Ostateczny krach systemu korporacji&quot;) all reached No. 1 and stayed in the Top20 for 37, 38, 30 and 23 weeks, respectively. In addition, &quot;Gdy nie ma dzieci&quot; spent 9 weeks at #1, a former record among Polish artists, surpassed by Artur Rojek&#x27;s &quot;Syreny&quot; in 2014.

Although the post-2000 albums by Kult enjoyed less popularity, Kult remains one of the best-known Polish musical groups. The band released a total of 17 studio albums and five live albums, including the 2010 recording of a MTV Unplugged concert.

== Members ==

<text>Dunn Loring station is a Washington Metro station in Fairfax County, Virginia, on the Orange Line. The station is in Merrifield, with a Vienna mailing address. The station is in the median of Interstate 66 at Gallows Road, just outside the Capital Beltway, and is accessed by a footbridge over the eastbound lanes.

==History==
The station opened on June 7, 1986. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail west of the Ballston–MU station and the opening of the , and stations. By 1993, officials in Fairfax City were looking to add &quot;Merrifield&quot; to the station name. In 1998, the station name was changed to Dunn Loring–Merrifield. On November 3, 2011, the station returned to its original name, with &quot;Merrifield&quot; listed as a subtitle.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platforms at the Dunn Loring station would be rebuilt starting in mid-2020.

From May 23 until September 7, 2020, this station was closed due to the platform reconstruction project which closed stations west of Ballston–MU station.

On June 3, 2023, this station was closed for track replacement, affecting stations west of Ballston–MU station. Service resumed on July 17, 2023.

==Development project==
In August 2011, Mill Creek Residential Trust, in cooperation with WMATA, began development on a new mixed-use development area known as Alexan Dunn Loring. The project was required to not reduce the number of parking spaces available to Metro riders. The first completed step was to remove the existing kiss and ride area, as well as the bus bays. This area became the primary Metro parking lot, while the old parking lot was built into a new parking garage. The new parking garage opened in August 2013. After the parking garage opened, construction began on the mixed-use development in the area of the temporary parking lot. Phase 1 of the mixed-use development project was scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. Construction was expected to be completed in 2015.

<text>State Route 520 (SR 520) is a state highway and freeway in the Seattle metropolitan area, part of the U.S. state of Washington. It runs from Seattle in the west to Redmond in the east. The freeway connects Seattle to the Eastside region of King County via the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge on Lake Washington. SR 520 intersects several state highways, including Interstate 5 (I-5) in Seattle, I-405 in Bellevue, and SR 202 in Redmond.

The original floating bridge was opened in 1963 as a replacement for the cross-lake ferry system that had operated since the late 19th century. In 1964, SR 520 was designated as a freeway connecting I-5 to I-405. An extension to Redmond was proposed later in the decade. In the 1970s and 1980s, sections of the freeway between Bellevue and Redmond were opened to traffic, replacing the temporary designation of SR 920.

Since the 1990s, SR 520 has been expanded with high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) and new interchanges to serve the Overlake area. In 2016, the original Evergreen Point Floating Bridge was replaced by a wider bridge, as part of a multibillion-dollar expansion program that is scheduled to be completed in the 2020s. The program also includes the construction of new bus infrastructure at Montlake and on the Eastside, as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path along most of the highway&#x27;s length.

==Route description==
SR 520 begins at an interchange with I-5 in northern Seattle near Roanoke Park. The interchange provides access to both directions of I-5 as well as a westbound off-ramp to Harvard Avenue and Roanoke Street. SR 520 travels east across the south end of Portage Bay and its wetlands on the Portage Bay Viaduct, entering the Montlake neighborhood. In Montlake, the highway intersects Montlake Boulevard (SR 513) and Lake Washington Boulevard just south of the University of Washington campus and Husky Stadium. The freeway gains a set of HOV lanes and continues east on a pair of causeways through the marshlands of Union Bay and Foster Island, at the north end of the Washington Park Arboretum.

From Seattle, SR 520 crosses Lake Washington on the six-lane Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is the longest floating bridge in the world. Tolls are collected electronically using the state&#x27;s Good to Go pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and the vehicle&#x27;s number of axles. , tolls for Good to Go users range from a minimum of $1.35 between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. and a maximum of $4.90 during the morning and evening peak periods; tolls paid by mail are charged an additional $2. The freeway reaches the eastern end of Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a landscaped park lid and next to a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR 520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point lid and bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor. SR 520 continues along the north side of the Bel-Red industrial area and enters the Overlake area of Redmond.

Within Overlake, SR 520 turns north and passes under a pedestrian bridge connecting to Overlake Village station on the 2 Line, a light rail line that follows the highway. The freeway then passes several office parks, including the headquarters campus of Microsoft and the Nintendo of America branch office. To serve exits at Northeast 40th Street and Northeast 51st Street, SR 520 gains a set of collector–distributor lanes, separated from other lanes by a concrete barrier. The freeway crosses the Sammamish River and turns east, passing to the south of the Redmond Town Center mall and Bear Creek and to the north of Marymoor Park. East of downtown Redmond, SR 520 intersects SR 202 and terminates; the road continues north as Avondale Road towards Cottage Lake. Portions of the corridor from Montlake to Downtown Redmond are also paralleled by a shared-use trail for bicycles and pedestrians.

SR 520&#x27;s entire route is designated as part of the National Highway System, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. The State of Washington also designates the SR 520 corridor as a Highway of Statewide Significance, a category of highways that connect major communities throughout the state. SR 520 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state&#x27;s highways to measure traffic volume in terms of annual average daily traffic. In 2016, WSDOT calculated that 80,000 vehicles traveled on SR 520 near its interchange with SR 202 in Redmond and 47,000 vehicles used it at SR 513 in Seattle, the highest and lowest traffic counts along the highway, respectively. The highway is noted for its lack of a &quot;reverse commute&quot;, with roughly equal amounts of traffic in both directions during peak periods.

==History==

===Ferries and proposed floating bridge===

New towns along the eastern shore of Lake Washington were established in the late 19th century and initially served by steamship ferries, bringing passengers and goods to and from Seattle. By 1913, the steam ferry &quot;Leschi&quot; was transporting automobiles and pedestrians between Seattle and the docks in Bellevue, Kirkland, and Medina. In 1940, the Lake Washington Floating Bridge was opened between Seattle and Mercer Island, carrying the Sunset Highway (later I-90) from Seattle towards Bellevue and the Eastside. The new bridge allowed the Eastside to develop rapidly into bedroom communities in the 1940s and 1950s; the bridge also replaced the ferry system, which ceased operation in 1950, shortly after the removal of tolls on the bridge.

In the late 1940s, the state government conducted a feasibility study for a second floating bridge across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the Mercer Island bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved the construction of a second floating bridge, using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the floating bridge was to connect to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later I-5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship Canal Bridge, as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway (later the R.H. Thompson Expressway) at Montlake. The east end was to connect to the planned north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area (later I-405), with an optional connection to the Stevens Pass Highway. Two alignments for the floating bridge were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by the state government and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project&#x27;s citizen committee.

===Opening of floating bridge and freeway===
Construction of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge began on August 29, 1960, and assembly of the bridge&#x27;s pontoons began the following year. The bridge and its approach highways, connecting the main branch of Primary State Highway 1 in Seattle to its Eastside branch near Bellevue, were added to the state highway system in March 1961. Construction of the western approach, an expressway between the Roanoke Interchange, Portage Bay, Montlake, and the Washington Park Arboretum, began in early 1962. The eastern approach was constructed between 1962 and 1963, connecting the bridge to Medina, Secondary State Highway 2A in southern Houghton, and Northup Way—a local road that continued east towards Redmond.

The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge opened on August 28, 1963, along with the Roanoke Expressway, part of the Seattle Freeway, and the eastern approach to Houghton and Bellevue up to a temporary interchange with 104th Avenue Northeast. The bridge and its approaches, constituting a state highway, were re-designated as Sign Route 520 (later SR 520) under the new state highway numbering system adopted in 1964. SR 520 would use a temporary route on Northup Way (Northeast 20th Street) and Bel-Red Road between Bellevue and SR 202 in Redmond until the planned freeway was completed by the late 1970s. A section of SR 520 between the Evergreen Point Bridge toll plaza and 104th Avenue Northeast was expanded in 1973 to accommodate a bus-only lane at the request of Metro Transit, which had begun operating express buses over the bridge.

===Extension to Redmond===

The Northup Interchange, where SR 520 intersects I-405, was opened on November 22, 1966. The highway was also extended east from 104th Avenue Northeast to 124th Avenue Northeast, serving the Bel-Red industrial area. The state government announced plans in 1968 to begin construction on the remaining freeway to Redmond, via a northeastward course through the Overlake area and across Marymoor Park. Construction of a segment between 124th Avenue Northeast and 148th Avenue Northeast in Overlake began in February 1972 and was completed in December 1973.

The planned route of SR 520 along the north side of Marymoor Park in Redmond was given the temporary designation of SR 920 in 1975. The two-lane expressway, connecting West Lake Sammamish Parkway (SR 901) and SR 202, was opened in July 1977 after several months of construction. Completion of the last segment of SR 520, between 148th Avenue Northeast and SR 920, was given priority by Eastside cities and civic groups in the mid-1970s. However, the City of Bellevue asked that the state government build a reversible bus lane on the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge before completing the last segment, due to increased traffic on the bridge. The City of Redmond opposed the request, leading to a dispute between the two cities that was later resolved with a compromise to place completion of SR 520 ahead of the bus lane.

The state government approved funding for the Redmond project in 1977, extending SR 520 by at an estimated cost of $10 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars), funded using part of a statewide gasoline tax increase of two cents per gallon. Contract bidding for the last segment was halted in 1978 by a lawsuit filed by a group of Eastside residents in opposition to the freeway, claiming that its environmental impact had been improperly assessed. U.S. District Judge Morell Edward Sharp ruled in favor of the state government in March 1979, allowing for the bid to be awarded to a contractor. The segment was opened to traffic on December 18, 1981. The SR 920 designation was removed from the state highway system in 1985, and the section was re-signed as part of SR 520. A traffic signal at the intersection of SR 520 and Northeast 51st Street remained in place until 1986, when it was replaced with an interchange.

===Freeway widening and new interchanges===

The completion of SR 520 spurred new development in Downtown Redmond and the Overlake area, contributing to major traffic congestion on the freeway. In 1994, the state government approved $81.1 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in highway improvements for the SR 520 corridor, including lane expansions and the addition of HOV lanes. The segment from West Lake Sammamish Parkway to SR 202 was widened from two to four lanes in September 1995, and included the construction of a new bridge across the Sammamish River. In late 1996, the highway&#x27;s terminus at SR 202 was converted from a signalized intersection to an interchange, including an overpass connecting to Avondale Road. SR 520&#x27;s HOV lanes between I-405 and West Lake Sammamish Parkway were opened in 1999 after a $40 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) expansion project. The new lanes were restricted to two persons per vehicle, while the older HOV lanes between I-405 and the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge had a three-person requirement. A new interchange was built at Northeast 40th Street in 2000 to serve the Microsoft Redmond Campus and other nearby employers, along with a set of collector–distributor lanes through the area, and ramp meters to manage traffic flow. Between 1994 and 2002, portions of a multi-use pedestrian and bicycle path on the north side of the freeway were completed and opened, forming a trail from northern Bellevue to Marymoor Park in Redmond.

In the late 2000s, WSDOT completed several highway improvement projects on the segment of SR 520 between West Lake Sammamish Parkway and SR 202 in Downtown Redmond. In August 2008, a flyover ramp from westbound SR 202 to westbound SR 520 was opened to traffic, replacing a pair of onramp traffic signals. SR 520 was widened to four lanes in each direction in 2010, in a multi-phase project that added HOV and merge lanes, as well as reconstructed ramps at West Lake Sammamish Parkway. In addition to the Downtown Redmond projects, a new lid-like overpass at Northeast 36th Street in Overlake was opened in 2010 to improve traffic in the area. The overpass&#x27;s $30 million cost (equivalent to $ million in dollars) was funded mostly by Microsoft, along with contributions from the City of Redmond and federal stimulus funding.

Additional projects were funded by the Connecting Washington funding package, which was approved by the state legislature in 2015. An additional ramp is being added to the 148th Avenue Northeast interchange in Overlake, connecting eastbound traffic to the Overlake Village area via a set of new streets and an underpass. It began construction in 2021 and was opened in December 2023 at a cost of $68 million. The package also funded $40.9 million to engineer and acquire land for an expanded interchange at 124th Avenue Northeast in Bellevue to serve the Spring District.

===Bridge replacement and corridor improvement program===
Since the opening of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several proposals from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic retrofit, and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend its life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.

The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking alternatives for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. The non-bridge elements of the project on the Eastside would be centered on lidding the freeway; a proposal to build a lid over the entire section between Lake Washington and I-405 was rejected due to its projected cost of $2 billion. In 2003, the alternatives were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle. WSDOT chose the project&#x27;s preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, in 2011. The $5.69 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR 520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.

Construction of the SR 520 corridor project began in April 2011 on the Eastside, where WSDOT expanded the freeway to six lanes and added HOV lanes. The project, completed in 2014, also included the construction of new bus stations and direct access ramps, new interchanges, park lids covering SR 520, and a multi-use trail. Construction of the new floating bridge began in 2012, and it was dedicated on April 2, 2016, as the longest floating bridge in the world. The westbound lanes opened on April 11 and the eastbound lanes were opened on April 25. The new, bridge features four general purpose lanes and two HOV lanes, as well as a multi-use trail on its north side that opened on December 20, 2017. Demolition of the former bridge was completed in early 2017. The western approach was partially replaced with a new bridge for westbound traffic in August 2017, with the eastbound lanes temporarily remaining on the old approach bridge. As part of the project, several &quot;ghost ramps&quot; in the Washington Park Arboretum for the cancelled R.H. Thomson Expressway were demolished in 2017, despite calls to preserve them in memory of the protests that cancelled the projects in the 1960s. A park with one preserved set of columns is planned to be constructed in the 2030s, but remains unfunded by Seattle Parks and Recreation.

Improvements to the remaining segment of the SR 520 corridor, between I-5 and the floating bridge, were initially left unfunded, but underwent design and environmental review. In 2015, the state legislature approved $1.64 billion in funding for the &quot;Rest of the West&quot; program, which will be constructed between 2018 and 2029. The first phase of the program, planned to be completed by 2024, included construction of the eastbound lanes of the western approach bridge and a new Montlake Boulevard interchange with HOV lane ramps, a relocated bus station, and a park lid. The eastbound approach to the floating bridge was opened to limited traffic in July 2023 and expanded to carry three lanes in its permanent configuration the following month. The HOV access ramps to Montlake Boulevard were opened in September 2024.

The second phase, to be constructed between 2020 and 2031, will include a new bridge across Portage Bay, a park lid near Roanoke Park, and a new HOV lane ramp to the I-5 reversible express lanes. The express lane ramp, planned to cost $68 million, was expected open in early 2024, but it was later delayed to 2030 due to the inability to increase transit service on the corridor. The Portage Bay bridge and Roanoke lid are expected to begin construction in late 2024 and be finished in 2031, in tandem with the express lane ramp, at a cost of up to $1.4 billion. The third phase is a planned second bascule bridge over the Montlake Cut that parallels the existing Montlake Bridge to increase vehicular capacity.

==Mass transit==

The SR 520 corridor is served by Sound Transit Express Route 545, as well as other Sound Transit Express, King County Metro, and Community Transit bus routes. The corridor averaged about 24,500 weekday riders in 2016, using 700 bus trips on 18 routes. During peak periods, buses travel on SR 520 every one to four minutes between the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and I-405.

Sound Transit began Link light rail service along the Redmond portion of the SR 520 corridor in April 2024, with the opening of the 2 Line to Redmond Technology station. Approved by voters in 2008, the line will connect Redmond Technology station at Northeast 40th Street and Overlake Village station at 152nd Avenue Northeast to Seattle and Downtown Bellevue, crossing Lake Washington on the I-90 floating bridge. The line is scheduled to be extended along SR 520 to Downtown Redmond in 2025, using funding from the Sound Transit 3 program approved by voters in 2016. The rebuilt floating bridge was also designed to accommodate a future light rail extension, requiring supplemental pontoons and new approaches.

<text>Canandaigua Lake State Marine Park is a New York state park and boat launch located on the north shore of Canandaigua Lake in Ontario County, New York.

The park is 1 of 80 New York State Parks that are in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with the park experiencing 2 minutes and 51 seconds of totality.

==Facilities==
The park offers three concrete boat ramps, with room for six boats to launch or be removed from the water simultaneously. A short canal allows boat access to Canandaigua Lake. Parking is available for up to 110 cars and trailers.

Between September 2011 and May 2012, the park was closed to allow for the complete reconstruction of the boat launch area.

Although the park&#x27;s primary purpose is to serve as a boat launch facility, fishing from shore is also permitted at the park. A small picnic area near a duck pond is also available.

<doc id="571140" wikidata="Q5391941" url="?curid=571140" title="West Falls Church station">
<text>West Falls Church station is a Washington Metro station in Idylwood, Virginia on the Orange Line, the first station inside the Capital Beltway on the Orange Line going east. It is one of only two stations in the system to have three tracks, the other being the station. The center track is used for storage and relaying trains to the adjacent Falls Church Yard.

==Facilities==

The station serves the suburban community of Falls Church and the Northern Virginia Center operated by Virginia Tech. Although Virginia Tech previously shared the space with the University of Virginia, as of June 2020, the University of Virginia has left the center. While the station has a street address on Haycock Road, it is physically located in the median of Interstate 66 near Virginia State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike); riders access the platform and mezzanine using an elevated walkway from the parking area.

This is a suburban transfer station, as commuter buses that serve communities near the Dulles Toll and Access Roads (Virginia State Route 267) connect to the Metro system at West Falls Church using a bus-only exit from the Access Road. These buses include Fairfax Connector to points within Fairfax, including Reston and Herndon, Metrobus to Tysons Corner, and Loudoun County Transit reverse commute routes to businesses including AOL and MCI and transfer points in Dulles.

With the opening of the Silver Line on July 26, 2014, many commuter bus routes that formerly terminated at West Falls Church were rerouted to instead terminate at locations along the new Silver Line stations in Tysons and Reston. West Falls Church was also the original staging point for Washington Flyer buses to Dulles Airport, but this shifted to Wiehle-Reston East with the opening of the Silver Line.

The Silver Line joins the Orange Line via a flying junction immediately east of this station but does not serve the station. Plans originally called for the Silver Line to stop at West Falls Church, but it was cut out of the final plan.

==History==
The station opened on June 7, 1986. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail west of the station and the opening of the , and stations.

In 1999, the station was renamed West Falls Church–VT/UVA when the acronym for Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia were added to the station&#x27;s name, two years after the dedication of the shared graduate center. These initialisms were moved to a subtitle location on November 3, 2011.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The West Falls Church station platforms would be rebuilt starting in late 2020.

From May 23 until August 15, 2020, this station was closed due to the platform reconstruction project which closed stations west of Ballston–MU station. On August 16, 2020, the station reopened as the Orange Line terminus when Silver and Orange Line trains were able to bypass East Falls Church station.

Per request by the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, the initials for the University of Virginia were dropped from the station&#x27;s secondary name on September 11, 2022, to reflect its departure from the nearby Northern Virginia Center.

On June 3, 2023, this station was closed for track replacement, affecting stations west of Ballston–MU station. Service resumed on June 26, 2023.

<text>Charles Augustus &quot;Charlie&quot; Semlin (December 4, 1836 – November 2, 1927) was a Canadian politician and rancher.

Born near Barrie, Upper Canada, Semlin worked there as a schoolteacher until 1862 when he moved to British Columbia during the gold rush to become a prospector. Failing at that, he took work under Clement Francis Cornwall at the Ashcroft Manor Ranch. With Philip Parke he established the Cache Creek Hotel. In 1869 he purchased the Dominion Ranch and became a rancher. He entered politics when British Columbia became a province of Canada, in 1871, winning the Yale riding in the provincial legislature in 1871 and was defeated in 1876, though won election again in 1882. He was Leader of the Opposition in 1884. While in politics Semlin was instrumental in the building and operating of a boarding school in Cache Creek. The site was chosen there as Cache Creek was the midpoint between the Cariboo region to the north and the populated areas of the Lower Mainland to the south. He lost his seat in 1875 but returned to the assembly in 1882. In 1894 he became leader of the opposition and finally the 12th premier of British Columbia in August 1898. His government lasted only two years and resigned to make way for the rump regime of Joseph Martin, who was defeated in the election of 1900.

He died on November 2, 1927, at his ranch, which is just east of Cache Creek, British Columbia. Semlin raised a daughter, Mary, and left much of his estate, valued at just over $50,000 and consisting mainly of stock in the Dominion Ranch to her.

==Legacy==
His name features in the Cache Creek area in the Canadian Pacific Railway railway-point name Semlin, on the south bank of the Thompson River near Cache Creek and in the name of the Semlin Valley which stretches east from Cache Creek on the north side of the Thompson, and is the route of the Trans-Canada Highway today. It was the location of his Dominion Ranch. A street in East Vancouver, Semlin Drive, bears his name.

<text>East Falls Church station is an island platformed Washington Metro station in Arlington County, Virginia, on the Orange and Silver Lines. East Falls Church station is the last aboveground, at-grade, or open-cut station for eastbound trains until Minnesota Avenue. East of this station, the trains enter tunnels.

The station serves the communities of Falls Church, Seven Corners, and Arlington. It is located in the median of Interstate 66 near Lee Highway (U.S. Route 29). Service began on June 7, 1986. A parking lot with 422 spaces sits on the Lee Highway side of the station.

==Transit-oriented development==
East Falls Church has the least transit-oriented development of the six stations on the Orange Line in Arlington County. Unlike the stations from Rosslyn to Ballston, East Falls Church station is in the median of Interstate 66, where it is difficult to access for pedestrians. As of 2018, Arlington County was considering plans to develop the site.

==History==
The station was built as part of the final westward extension of the Orange Line to Vienna., a stretch west of the Ballston–MU station. It opened on June 7, 1986, along with the West Falls Church, Dunn Loring, and Vienna stations.

When the Silver Line began service on July 26, 2014, East Falls Church became the final transfer point before its split with the Orange Line.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at 20 stations. The East Falls Church station platform was to have been be rebuilt starting in early 2021. However, due to low ridership caused by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, platform reconstruction began one year early, along with other maintenance and repair projects on all stations to the west. This station was one of 19 WMATA stations closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The station was further closed due to the platform reconstruction and Silver Line phase two tie-in projects that closed stations west of Ballston–MU station. Shuttle buses began serving the station on June 28, 2020. Trains began bypassing the station on August 16, 2020, when work was nearly done. The station was reopened on August 23, 2020.

From June 3 to 26, 2023, the station was closed for track replacement, along with other stations west of Ballston–MU station.

==Station layout==
Similar to all stations within the Interstate 66 median apart from West Falls Church, East Falls Church has a simple island platform setup with two tracks. An exit in the central part of the platform leads to a mezzanine on the western side of North Sycamore Street. The station&#x27;s parking lot and bus bays are to the north of this exit at the southwestern corner of the intersection of North Sycamore Street and North Washington Boulevard. Bike parking is available directly south of the station&#x27;s entrance, alongside bike lockers near the entrance.

<text>Maximilien Luce (; 13 March 1858 – 6 February 1941) was a prolific French Neo-impressionist artist, known for his paintings, graphic art, and his anarchist activism. Starting as a wood-engraver, he then concentrated on painting, first as an Impressionist, then as a Pointillist, and finally returning to Impressionism.

==Early life and education==

Maximilien-Jules-Constant Luce was born on 13 March 1858 in Paris. His parents, of modest means, were Charles-Désiré Luce (1823–1888), a railway clerk, and Louise-Joséphine Dunas (1822–1878). The family lived in the Montparnasse, a working-class district of Paris. Luce attended school at l&#x27;Ecole communale, beginning in 1864.

In 1872, the fourteen-year-old Luce became an apprentice with wood-engraver Henri Théophile Hildebrand (1824–1897). During his three-year xylography apprenticeship, he also took night classes in drawing from instructors Truffet and Jules-Ernest Paris (1827–1895). During this period, Luce started painting in oils. He moved with his family to the southern Paris suburb of Montrouge. His art education continued as he attended drawing classes taught by Diogène Maillard (1840–1926) at the Gobelins tapestry factory.

Luce began working in the studio of (1844–1900) in 1876, producing wood-engravings for various publications, including &quot;L&#x27;Illustration&quot; and London&#x27;s &quot;The Graphic&quot;. He took additional art courses, at l&#x27;Académie Suisse, and also in the studio of portrait painter Carolus-Duran (1837–1917). Through Froment&#x27;s studio, Luce became friends with Léo Gausson and Émile-Gustave Cavallo-Péduzzi. These three artists spent time around Lagny-sur-Marne creating Impressionist landscapes.

==Work==

Luce spent four years in the military, starting in 1879, serving in Brittany at Guingamp. The next year, he received a promotion to corporal, and he became friends with Alexandre Millerand, who, in 1920, assumed the office of President of France. In 1881 he requested the restoration of his lower rank of soldier, second class. Carolus-Duran used his influence to get a transfer for Luce to Paris barracks. His stint in the military came to a close in 1883.

The prevalence of the new zincography printing process rendered xylography nearly obsolete as a profession. When the opportunities for employment as an engraver became scarce, Luce shifted his focus to painting full-time in about 1883.

Gausson and Cavallo-Péduzzi introduced Luce in about 1884 to the Divisionist technique developed by Georges Seurat. This influenced Luce to begin painting in the Pointillist style. In contrast to Seurat&#x27;s detached manner, Luce&#x27;s paintings were passionate portrayals of contemporary subjects, depicting the &quot;violent effects of light&quot;. He moved to Montmartre in 1887. Luce joined the Société des Artistes Indépendants and participated in their third spring exhibition, where Paul Signac purchased one of his pieces, &quot;La Toilette&quot;. Camille Pissarro and critic Félix Fénéon were also impressed by the seven Luce works displayed in the show. Fénéon characterized Luce as a &quot;coarse, honest man, with a rough and muscular talent.&quot; In addition to Pissarro and Signac, he met many of the other Neo-impressionists, including Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross, Charles Angrand, Armand Guillaumin, Hippolyte Petitjean, Albert Dubois-Pillet, and Pissarro&#x27;s son Lucien. A &quot;New York Times&quot; critic declared this Pointillist period to be the pinnacle of Luce&#x27;s artistic career, singling out the radiant 1895 painting &quot;On the Bank of the Seine at Poissy&quot; as an example. He described the skillfully executed painting as &quot;a lyrical celebration of nature.&quot;

With the exception of the years 1915 to 1919, Luce exhibited in every show at Les Indépendants from 1887 until he died in 1941, including a thirty-year retrospective held in 1926. In 1909, he was elected vice president of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, and was elected president in 1935, following the death of Signac, who had held the post since 1908. However, in 1940 he resigned from the position as a protest against the Vichy regime&#x27;s laws which would have prohibited Jewish artists from participating in the group. Luce had his first solo exhibition, arranged by Fénéon, in July 1888, exhibiting ten paintings at the &quot;La Revue indépendante&quot; offices. He showed six paintings at the 1889 Les XX exhibition in Brussels. While there, he met Les XX official Octave Maus, as well as Symbolist poet Emile Verhaeren and fellow Neo-impressionist painter Théo van Rysselberghe. Luce&#x27;s work was also featured in the ninth Les XX exhibition, in 1892.

In the spring of 1892 Luce traveled with Pissarro to London. Later that year, he visited Saint-Tropez with Signac, and in the summer of 1893, he went to Brittany.

Starting near the early part of the twentieth century, his identification with the Neo-impressionists began to disappear, as he became less active politically, and his artistic style shifted from Neo-impressionism, and he resumed painting in an Impressionist manner. Some of his paintings during this period depicted wounded World War I soldiers arriving from the battlefront to Paris.

Luce depicted a diverse range of subjects in his works over a long career. He most frequently created landscapes, but his other works include portraits, still lifes (especially florals), domestic scenes, such as bathers, and images of welders, rolling mill operators, and other laborers.

==Anarchism==
Luce aligned with the Neo-impressionists not only in their artistic techniques, but also in their political philosophy of anarchism. Many of his illustrations were featured in socialist periodicals, notably &quot;La Révolte&quot;, Jean Grave&#x27;s magazine which was later called &quot;Les Temps nouveaux&quot;. Other socialist/anarchist publications which he contributed to include &quot;Le Père Peinard&quot;, &quot;Le Chambard&quot;, and &quot;La Guerre sociale&quot;. On 8 July 1894, Luce, suspected of involvement in June assassination of President of France Marie François Sadi Carnot, was arrested and was confined to Mazas Prison. He was released forty two days later, on 17 August, following his acquittal at the Procès des trente. He published &quot;Mazas&quot;, an album consisting of ten lithographs documenting the experiences of himself and other political prisoners incarcerated in Mazas; accompanying the lithographs was text by Jules Vallès. In 1896, while King Alfonso XIII of Spain was visiting Paris, the police detained Luce on the grounds that he was a &quot;dangerous anarchist&quot;.

Luce&#x27;s choice of subject matter for his art was often rooted in his political beliefs. Through his paintings, he passionately demonstrated empathy and fellowship with the proletariat.

==Family==
In 1893, Luce met Ambroisine &quot;Simone&quot; Bouin in Paris. She became his model, companion, common-law wife, and wife. Bouin was usually referred to as &quot;Madame Luce&quot;, even before their eventual marriage. She was frequently a model for him, appearing in many of his works, often partially or fully nude, other times depicted in scenes such as on a balcony or combing her hair. The couple&#x27;s first son, Frédérick, was born on 5 June 1894, but he died fifteen months later, on 2 September 1895. Their second child, whom they also named Frédérick, was born in 1896, and in 1903 they adopted Ambroisine&#x27;s nephew Georges Édouard Bouin, who had become orphaned. The couple got married on 30 March 1940 in Paris; just a few months later, Ambroisine died, in Rolleboise, on 7 June 1940.

==Death and assessment==
Luce died at his Paris home on 7 February 1941, at the age of 83. He was buried in Rolleboise. In May 1941, the Bibliothèque nationale de France held a memorial exhibition, and another memorial exhibition was mounted at Les Indépendants from March to April 1942.

Luce was among the most productive of the Neo-impressionists, creating over two thousand oil paintings, a comparably large number of watercolors, gouaches, pastels, and drawings, plus over a hundred prints.

The Musée d&#x27;Orsay assesses Luce as &quot;one of the best representatives of the neo-impressionist movement&quot;. Although he had had many solo exhibitions of his work in France, the first one in the United States did not occur until a 1997 retrospective at Wildenstein &amp; Company in Manhattan.

&quot;Notre Dame de Paris&quot;, painted in 1900, sold at auction in May 2011 for , setting a record for a Luce work.

<doc id="571148" wikidata="Q3563745" url="?curid=571148" title="Ballston–MU station">
<text>Ballston–MU station is a side-platformed Washington Metro station in the Ballston section of Arlington County, Virginia. The station opened on December 1, 1979, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station is part of the Orange and Silver Lines and serves the transit-oriented community of Ballston, Ballston Quarter, and Marymount University (MU).

Ballston–MU is also a central Metrobus transfer station. The station entrance is at North Fairfax Drive and North Stuart Street, near Wilson Boulevard and North Glebe Road. West of this station, the tracks rise above the ground inside the median of Interstate 66.

== History ==
Originally to be called Glebe Road, the station was renamed Ballston by the Metro board in March 1977. After several years of construction, the station opened on December 1, 1979, as the western terminus of the Orange Line. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail west of the Rosslyn station and the opening of the Court House, Clarendon and Virginia Square stations. Ballston served as the western terminus of the Orange Line from its opening through the opening of its extension to the Vienna station on June 7, 1986. The station remains as the final underground station for westbound travelers since its completion.

Known simply as Ballston since its opening, in December 1995, the Metro board voted unanimously to rename the station Ballston–MU, with the &quot;MU&quot; standing for the adjacent Marymount University. The $85,000 required for the change was paid for by Arlington County.

The station was the western terminus for Orange Line trains for several months in 2020 due to platform reconstructions at stations west of Ballston. On August 16, 2020, all Orange Line trains were extended to West Falls Church station when it reopened, bypassing East Falls Church station.

=== Western entrance ===
Since at least 2005, the Arlington County government has planned for an additional western entrance to Ballston station, to be located on the south side of Fairfax Drive at North Vermont Street, intended to relieve crowding at the main entrance, serve the dense residential and office developments in that part of the neighborhood and serve buses coming from Interstate 66. It would have escalators and elevators leading to a new mezzanine with faregates at the western end of the station platform. Developer JBG Cos. agreed to build the entrance in 2005 as part of a new development at 4420 Fairfax Dr., in exchange for a higher density allowance than usual. But as of 2024, JBG had not started the development project.

In September 2013, the Arlington County Board approved a funding plan for the county&#x27;s share of revenue generated by Virginia&#x27;s new transportation legislation. The plan calls for $500,000 to be allocated to planning for the new western entrance, which at the time was forecast to be completed in 2018.

In 2022, the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority approved a $80 million grant to the county for the project. Plans for the entrance were published in October 2024, with construction planned for 2026 to 2029 at a cost of $177 million.

<doc id="571151" wikidata="Q3101629" url="?curid=571151" title="George Hargreaves">
<text>George Hargreaves (born November 12, 1952) is a landscape architect. Under his design direction, the work of his firm has received numerous national awards and it has been published and exhibited nationally and internationally. He was an artist in residence at the American Academy of Rome in 2009. Hargreaves and his firm designed numerous sites including the master plan for the Sydney 2000 Olympics, The Brightwater Waste Water Treatment Facility in Seattle, Washington, and University of Cincinnati Master Plan.

==Education==

According to Ken Gwertz&#x27;s article &quot;Landscape Alchemist,&quot; George Hargreaves&#x27; interest in Landscape Architecture was partially due to a summer trip that he went on when he was 18 years old. During the trip to the Rocky Mountains, George Hargreaves climbed Flat Top Mountain where he experienced a life changing scene. Hargreaves describes the sense, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just the mountains or the trees or any of the individual elements. It was something about the sense of space itself. When I got back home I tried to explain this to my uncle...and he said, &#x27;Have you ever thought about going into landscape architecture?&#x27;&quot; In 1973, George Hargreaves attended the School of Environment and Design at the University of Georgia. Four years later, he graduated second in his class, magna cum laude, with a Bachelor of Landscape Architecture. Soon after getting his bachelor&#x27;s degree, George went to Harvard University Graduate School of Design. He graduated with distinction and received a master&#x27;s degree in Landscape Architecture.

==Professional experience==

In 1983, Hargreaves Associates, now Hargreaves Jones, was founded. George and Hargreaves Associates have worked on many well known designs over the years. George Hargreaves is an important part of every design.

Hargreaves Jones (previously Hargreaves Associates) is a professional consulting firm composed of landscape architects and planners with offices in San Francisco, California, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. The work includes a wide range of urban design, waterfronts, public parks, academic, corporate, institutional, and residential planning and design projects. According to Hargreaves, &quot;Convention is easy to slip into, to keep making the same pictures. What I try to find are those magic moments of clarity when you hear what the site is whispering to you.&quot; Landscape Alchemist

In the Introduction of the 2009 publication on his practice, Landscape Alchemy, Hargreaves cites that the firm seldom encounters project sites that are a greenfield or “natural” but are more likely to be brownfields, often flat, devoid of any significant vegetation or other natural features, yet close to city centers. Mostly late 20th century and early 21st century sites, they differ greatly from the majority of the sites for the great parks realized from the 17th to early 20th century that had much more obvious character where glacial terrain with remnant countryside provided what Hargreaves likes to call “good bones”. Additionally, he points out that “our design strategies is a continuing search for the way to conceptually enter the site and create bones where there are none”, and that while each Hargreaves project integrates sustainability, phenomena and process, site histories, adjacencies and overlays, “none should operate singularly - they all interact on the same site as we strive to put bones in our projects that will give them life for decades or centuries to come”.

At his presentation to the Forum for Urban Design Spring Conference 2009: the 21st Century Park &amp; Contemporary City held at the Modern Museum of Art, Hargreaves emphasized that &quot;distressed sites, whether abandoned, polluted, neglected, or all three, are the dross from which 21st Century dreams are woven&quot;.

==Academic experience==

George Hargreaves started his academic career shortly after he started Hargreaves Associates. He first taught at universities such as Cal Poly, University of Illinois Champaign, and University of Virginia Charlottesville. In 1986, George began to teach at Harvard University Graduate School of Design where he became a tenured professor and continued teaching there for over twenty years. He was the chair for the Department of Landscape Architecture from 1996 through 2003. Prior to resigning from his position at Harvard to focus on his practice, he was the Peter Louis Hornbeck Professor in Practice of Landscape Architecture and taught advanced and theoretical design classes and core studios.

An important piece of his academic work is the book he co-wrote with Julia Czerniak. The book is &quot;Large Parks&quot;. &quot;Large Parks&quot; is compilation of eight essays on large urban parks. These essays talk about the complexity of the parks and how they are a part of society. &quot;Large Parks&quot; is only the latest in a long line of publications that he has written and was awarded the J. B. Jackson Book Prize by the Foundation for Landscape Studies for having contributed significantly to the understanding of landscape studies.

<doc id="571154" wikidata="Q2471075" url="?curid=571154" title="2nd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)">
<text>The 2nd Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army that was formed and disestablished numerous times between 1809 and 2012. It was raised by Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley for service in the Peninsular War (part of the Coalition Wars of the Napoleonic Wars) as the 2nd Division. It was disestablished in 1814, but re-formed the following year for service in the War of the Seventh Coalition. The formation fought at the Battle of Waterloo and played an important role in defeating the final French attack of the day. It then marched into France and became part of the Army of Occupation, and was the only British force allowed to march through Paris. In December 1818, the division was disbanded once again.

During the mid- to late-19th century, several formations bearing the name 2nd Division were formed. Only two such were considered part of the division&#x27;s lineage by Everard Wyrall, who compiled its First World War history. The first was created in 1854 to take part in the Crimean War against the Russian Empire, fighting in the Battle of Inkerman and throughout the Siege of Sevastopol. In 1856, after the conclusion of hostilities, it was stood down. The second incarnation was raised in 1899 for the Second Boer War. It took part in all the battles that made up the Relief of Ladysmith, before advancing into Boer territory. At the end of 1900, when conventional warfare ended, the division was broken up so its forces could be reassigned to mobile columns or to garrison towns in an effort to combat the Boer guerrilla tactics.

The division was re-formed in 1902, but this time as a permanent formation and not on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis for a particular emergency. It was based at Aldershot, in southern England, before the First World War. In 1914 it was deployed to France a few weeks after the start of the war, as part of the British Expeditionary Force. The formation served on the Western Front and suffered heavy casualties. After the war, the division returned to Aldershot where it remained throughout the inter-war period. During the Second World War, the formation was again deployed to France in the opening stages of the conflict. In the subsequent Battle of France it was forced back to the port of Dunkirk and evacuated to the United Kingdom. It then served in Burma, and ended the war in British India. The division remained within the British order of battle in the post-war years, and formed part of the British Army of the Rhine in Germany. In 1976 the formation was transformed into the 2nd Armoured Division and maintained this role until the end of 1982. It was then disbanded in Germany, and the 2nd Division was re-formed in York, England, in 1983. Following the end of the Cold War and the decrease in the size of the British Army, it was again disbanded; only to be re-raised in the mid-1990s. At the turn of the millennium the division moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, and was most recently disbanded in 2012.

==Napoleonic Wars==
===Peninsular War===
During the French Revolutionary Wars and early in the Napoleonic Wars, the brigade was largest organised formation used by the British Army during campaigns. These consisted of two or more battalions grouped together under the command of a major-general, and suited the small size of the army and the operations it conducted. When needed, larger forces were assembled on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis; these included multiple brigades that were grouped into &quot;lines&quot; or &quot;columns&quot;. As the army and its operations grew, it implemented divisions—a single formation of two or more brigades that was usually commanded by a lieutenant-general. The division concept was not new and had been used by other European armies towards the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). On 18 June 1809 Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley, commander of British forces in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War, reorganised his force into four divisions: the 1st, the 2nd, the 3rd, and the 4th.
Major-General Rowland Hill was given command of the newly formed 2nd Division, which was around 3,900 men strong. It first saw action at the Battle of Talavera (27–28 July 1809), and suffered 888 casualties over two days of fighting. The division, now 10,000-strong and including embedded Portuguese troops, was present at the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September 1810 but did not see combat. By October it was manning redoubts in the Torres Vedra defensive line, near Alhandra. While French forces skirmished with the division&#x27;s pickets, the main position was not engaged. In November, Hill, who was suffering from fever, was replaced by Major-General William Stewart; one of the division&#x27;s brigade commanders. Detached from Wellesley&#x27;s main force, the division missed most of the major battles during the 1811–12 period and acquired the nickname the &quot;Observing Division&quot;. Despite this, the division was involved in several battles during that period. At the Battle of Albuera Stewart received criticism for his handling of the division and ignoring orders. As the division moved to take position alongside engaged Spanish forces, Stewart ordered his lead brigade to strike the flank of the attacking French. Stewart ignored a request by the brigade commander to establish his own flank guard, thus leaving it vulnerable. While the brigade was engaged in this manoeuvre, and concealed by a blinding hailstorm, 800 Polish lancers had approached the brigade&#x27;s open flank. The lancers charged into the British flank, inflicting 1,248 casualties, or 75 per cent of the brigade&#x27;s strength. The total divisional losses in the battle amounted to 2,868. On 28 October 1811 the divisionwith attached Spanish cavalrytook part in the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos, where it captured Arroyo dos Molinos, scattered the garrison and took around 1,300 prisoners with a loss of 101 men. On 19 May 1812, at the Battle of Almaraz, 900 men of the division entered Fort Napoleon by surprise. After a fierce, closely fought battle they forced the garrison to retreat. The fort&#x27;s guns were used to subdue the garrison of nearby Fort Ragusa, which the division occupied, and then secured an important river crossing over the Tagus. The fighting resulted in around 400 French casualties, and the division suffered 189 casualties including 37 killed. In late 1812, while it covered the retreat of coalition forces, the division failed to fully destroy a bridge. This allowed French forces to cross the Tagus faster than anticipated.

The following year, on 21 June, the division fought at the Battle of Vitoria, where it formed part of the British right flank and suffered 1,110 casualties. In July the division briefly took part in the Siege of Pamplona, before it fought numerous engagements during the Battle of the Pyrenees. The most notable was the Battle of Maya. During the morning of 25 July 1813 French forces attacked to the south of the division&#x27;s position. This attracted Stewart&#x27;s attention, and he left to investigate without leaving instructions or informing anyone where he had gone. Oman wrote Stewart &quot;must also be given the discredit of the very inadequate arrangements that had been made for the defence&quot; of the Maya pass. French troops, who had made use of the terrain, advanced undetected towards the division, attacked, and overran five light infantry companies. The division then conducted several piecemeal counter-attacks. In the afternoon Stewart returned and organised a withdrawal to a new position, fended off new attacks, and ended the day in a strong position that blocked the pass despite having lost possession of it. Despite this, Stewart was ordered to withdraw after dark by Hill, who was now his corps commander. The fighting resulted in the division suffering 1,320 casualties, which also included Stewart who was wounded. Over the rest of July and into August, the division lost a further 516 casualties. The division next defended the Pyrenees passes at Roncesvalles over the following months, before it fought in several engagements during the advance into France. These included the Battle of Nivelle, a bloody engagement at Saint Pierre that cost 903 casualties, and fighting at Orthez and Aire-sur-l&#x27;Adour with relatively few casualties. The division played no further major role in the campaign, which concluded after the capture of Toulouse on 12 April 1814. Meanwhile, Napoleon, Emperor of the French, had abdicated following the capture of Paris on 31 March. With the War of the Sixth Coalition over, the division was broken up. The troops marched to Bordeaux, where they either returned to the United Kingdom or were transported to North America to take part in the ongoing War of 1812.

===Waterloo===

At the end of the war, British and Hanoverian troops moved into the Southern Netherlands (previously Austrian Netherlands), as part of an Anglo-Dutch effort to secure the territory while they awaited a political outcome at the Congress of Vienna. Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton arrived in late 1814 to command and train these forces. On 11 April 1815, after the outbreak of the War of the Seventh Coalition upon Napoleon&#x27;s return to power, elements of this force became the 2nd Division under Clinton&#x27;s command. This force comprised one brigade of British light infantry and riflemen, one brigade of the King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL)a British unit consisting mainly of expatriate German troops, and one brigade of recently raised Hanoverian &quot;Landwehr&quot;.

At the Battle of Waterloo, on 18 June 1815, the division formed part of Hill&#x27;s 2nd Corps. The division&#x27;s 6,450 men started the day in reserve and protected the right flank of the British position. During the afternoon, when French skirmishers attacked British cannons, the division&#x27;s light infantry brigadeunder the command of Major-General Frederick Adammoved forward to drive them back and protect the guns. Afterwards, it and the KGL brigade advanced to a position behind Château d&#x27;Hougoumont, an important tactical strongpoint in front of the British line. Formed into infantry squares and under fire from French skirmishers, the brigades assisted in the château&#x27;s defence, and fired at French cavalry attacking other British forces. The KGL brigade also fended off several direct cavalry attacks. Around 19:30 the final French attack began when the Imperial Guard&#x27;s Middle Guard advanced on the British right flank and engaged the British Foot Guard regiments. Adam responded by wheeling his brigade left into a line to face the French flank. His troops, particularly the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot, fired volleys into the French in a fierce firefight, and then charged. This, in conjunction with the resistance of the British foot guards, halted the French attack and caused the Middle Guard to retreat. With Hanoverian troops covering their flank, Adam&#x27;s brigade advanced after the French before a general advance by the Anglo–Dutch army. With the French in retreat, the Hanoverian and KGL troops cleared the woods around the Château d&#x27;Hougoumont, while other elements of the Hanoverian brigade advanced. Adam&#x27;s brigade, with one Hanoverian battalion in support, advanced towards the La Belle Alliance inn, the centre of the French position. Near the inn, Imperial Guard units, including elements of the Old Guard, had formed a square as a rearguard. Adam&#x27;s troops engaged them and forced them to retreat. They halted at dusk, which heralded the close of the battle, during which the division had suffered 1,563 casualties.

Following the battle, the division marched into France with the rest of the coalition force. It arrived at Saint-Denis, on the outskirts of Paris, on 1 July. Six days later, Adam&#x27;s brigade entered Paris and marched along the Champs-Élysées, the only British troops to enter the capital. In October the Army of Occupation was formed and included the 2nd Division. By the end of the year the German elements of the division had left, and a newly formed British brigade had replaced them. Clinton remained in command of the division until it and the Army of Occupation were disbanded in December 1818, when they left France for the UK.

==Victorian Era==
Everard Wyrall, the official historian of the 2nd Division during the First World War, described the division&#x27;s lineage as including the Peninsular War, the Battle of Waterloo, the Crimean War, and the Second Boer War. Outside of this lineage, other 2nd Divisions were raised during the 19th century, each on an ad hoc basis. A 1,250-strong 2nd Division was organised in 1851 under Colonel George Mackinnon, during the Eighth Xhosa War. In 1857 an expeditionary force was formed from the Indian Army for service in the Second Opium War. The force contained a 2nd Division, which was under the command of Major-General Robert Napier. Major-General George Jackson Carey took command of a 2nd Division, which was around 10,000 men strong and had been formed in September 1871 solely for training manoeuvres in England. In 1879 Major-General Edward Newdegate commanded a 2nd Division during the Anglo-Zulu War. During the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, Lieutenant-General Edward Bruce Hamley commanded another newly established 2nd Division.

===Crimean War===

On 28 March 1854, in support of the Ottoman Empire, the British and the Second French Empire declared war on the Russian Empire. Anglo-French forces landed at Gallipoli, to be in a position to defend Constantinople if needed. In mid-June the British force advanced to Varna, on the Black Sea coast of Ottoman Bulgaria. At Varna they were reorganised into divisions, and the expeditionary force suffered from a cholera outbreak. Sir George de Lacy Evans was given command of the division, which was around 3,500 men strong, on 20 June. Clive Ponting, a historian, described him as &quot;the only British commander with even the remotest experience of European war&quot;, based on his service in the Peninsular War and Spanish Carlist Wars of the 1830s. During this period, British strategic policy was to destroy the Russian Black Sea Fleet based at Sevastopol to end the war and carry out long-term British goals. The French also adopted this immediate goal.

On 14 September the Anglo-French expeditionary landed north of Sevastopol. They marched south and encountered the Russians at the Alma River, which blocked further progress. Communication between the British and French was poor, and the British expeditionary force&#x27;s commander did not communicate the overall battle plan. On 20 September the division formed the right wing of the British advance with the French on their right. In the afternoon, it attacked across the river, fended off a counter-attack, and pushed the Russians from their positions, suffering 498 casualties during the day including Evans who was wounded. The advance resumed on 23 September, and the expeditionary force surrounded the Russian port in October. This began the Siege of Sevastopol. On 26 October the division fended off a Russian attack, and inflicted around 270 casualties for 100 of their own. During this action, Evans was injured when he fell from his horse, and Major-General John Pennefather, one of his brigade commanders, replaced him. On 5 November, under heavy fog, the 2nd Division was assailed by an overwhelming Russian force and played an important role during the Battle of Inkerman. Pennefather ordered his force to counter-attack, and they inflicted heavy losses on the Russians that saw close range bayonet fighting. The division continued to fight throughout the day following subsequent Russian attacks and suffered at least 744 casualties, including 194 killed. Although the battle ended in an Allied victory, it created the conditions that dragged the siege on through the winter into 1855. After the city had been subjected to several major cannonades, the division launched several failed attacks on Russian defensive positions, leading up to, and including the Battle of the Great Redan in 1855. This marked the division&#x27;s final effort of the campaign. The expeditionary force remained in the Crimea until the war ended in 1856, after which the army demobilised.

===Second Boer War===
Following the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71) the British Army reviewed and attempted to implement a similar organisation to that used by the Prussian Army. The resultant 1875 mobilisation scheme called for twenty-four divisions spread across eight army corps. These formations did not exist, and the scheme looked for scattered units to coalesce in a time of crisis. The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October 1899, after tensions rose between the British Empire and the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. In response, and to reinforce their military presence in southern Africa, the British Government mobilised the Natal Field Force. This force, also known as the First Army Corps, corresponded with the ICorps of the 1875 mobilisation scheme, and include the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions.

On mobilisation, the 2nd Division consisted of the 3rd (Highland) and the 4th Brigade, and was commanded by Major-General Francis Clery. Before the division arrived in southern Africa, the Boers invaded the British Cape and Natal colonies, and besieged Kimberley and Ladysmith respectively. As there was no strategic plan in place for the use of the First Army Corps, it was used piecemeal as it arrived. The Highland Brigade was assigned to the Kimberley relief column, while the 4th Brigade was dispatched to Natal to relieve Ladysmith. Clery, promoted to lieutenant-general, arrived at Frere, south of the Ladysmith, on 2 December.
The 2nd Division swelled to include four brigades, seven mounted infantry companies, engineers, and artillery. This force totalled 16,000 men and 44 artillery pieces. Clery intended to use this force to push across the Tugela River, punch through the entrenched Boer positions on the opposite bank and relieve Ladysmith. At the subsequent Battle of Colenso this effort was defeated. Before the fighting, an artillery battery had moved close to the river and the Boer positions. This resulted in many of the crew being rendered casualties once the Boer onslaught started. General Redvers Buller, commander of the First Army Corps, was present at the battle and had left Clery to command. Once the artillery became endangered, Buller asserted himself. He ordered the guns retrieved, and the withdrawal of the division. In the fighting, Clery&#x27;s command suffered 1,127–1,138 casualties. Colenso was one of a string of defeats that the British suffered in a one-week period, which became known as Black Week. In January 1900 the force was reorganised so that the 2nd Division comprised just the 2nd and 5th Brigades. On 6 January the division bombarded Boer positions at Colenso. Two days later the 2nd and the 5th Divisions took part in the second attempt to relieve Ladysmith. On 18 January the division crossed the river near Springfield and outflanked Colenso to the west. It then fought two subsequent actions: one the next day, the other on 22 January. The advance resulted in defeat at the Battle of Spion Kop, although the division did not take part in the battle. On 5 February, at the Battle of Vaal Krantz, the 2nd Division established a bridgehead across the Tugela. Buller denied Clery&#x27;s request for approval to further advance, and the Boers seized the high ground and penned the division against the river. The position was held, under artillery fire, until 7 February when the division was withdrawn after suffering 290 casualties. The division next saw action on 17 February at the Battle of the Tugela Heights, where it captured a strategically important hill with the loss of 170 men. Further actions were fought on 24 and 26–27 February. The Battle of the Tugela Heights saw the Boers defeated, and the siege of Ladysmith lifted.

The division rested in Natal until May, then spearheaded Buller&#x27;s corps advance to the South African Republic capital of Pretoria. It arrived near Johannesburg, south of Pretoria, in the first week of July and linked up with the main British force that had already arrived following their advance from Kimberley. The division moved east and fought an action on 8 August and then occupied Amersfoort. Four days later the division took the surrender of a 182-strong Boer commando unit. Along with the rest of the main British force, it advanced farther east in pursuit of Boer commandos who had retreated. This marked the end of the conventional stage of warfare, as the Boers adopted guerrilla warfare tactics. During this period, the main British force had employed looting and burning farms as a tactic; Buller forbade his troops from doing similar. The division moved back to guard the lines of communication, and was then spread out between Ladysmith and Heidelberg, near Johannesburg, during September. By the end of 1900 the field divisions had been broken up to disperse the troops to garrison towns and create more mobile forces to counter the new Boer tactics.

==Reform period==
In response to the lessons learnt from the war, which included the army&#x27;s failings in the opening months, the Secretary of State for War, St John Brodrick, set out to reform the standing army. He intended to create six army corps, three of which would be composed of permanent standing formations that consisted of the army&#x27;s regulars. They would be ready for immediate dispatch in light of an imperial crisis or in the event of European war. In 1902 three corps were formed that would allow up to nine divisions, each of two brigades, to be created. This included the 2nd Division formed on 1 April 1902, under the command of Major-General Charles Douglas. The division consisted of the 3rd and the 4th Brigades, and was based in Aldershot. The division was part of the 1st Army Corps, of only two divisions (the 3rd Division would be mobilised in the event of war). In 1907 the Haldane Reforms further restructured the regular army into six infantry divisions, each with three brigades. These would form the basis of any British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that would be dispatched to Europe in the case of war. This included the 2nd Division, which then consisted of the 4th (Guards), the 5th, and the 6th Brigades. The 1st and the 2nd Divisions were allocated to Aldershot Command, a military district based at Aldershot. On the outbreak of war, Aldershot Command would form the nucleus of a new I Corps, which would then be dispatched with the BEF. The 2nd Division took part in the Army Manoeuvres of 1912 and 1913.

==First World War==
===1914===
On 28 July 1914 the First World War began and a week later Germany invaded Belgium, and the British Empire entered the war against the German Empire. The same day, reservists were called-up and ordered to join the division to bring it up to full strength. The war establishment of each of the BEF&#x27;s divisions was 18,179 men. This process took until 9 August. Three days later, the majority of the division embarked ships at Southampton and began landing at Le Havre the following day. By 21 August the division had fully arrived in France and had assembled on the Belgian border along with the rest of the BEF.

The next day, the BEF advanced into Belgium with the French Fifth Army. The divisional reconnaissance elements made contact with German forces on 23 August on the outskirts of Mons. This resulted in the division&#x27;s first casualties of the war, as well as the first of eighteen Victoria Cross that would be earned by members of the division during the war. While IICorps saw the brunt of the fighting during the Battle of Mons, the division entrenched around south of the city and contended with shellfire and false reports of German movements. At nightfall, following a strategic reverse, the division and the BEF were ordered to retreat; a move known as the Great Retreat. Forced to abandon large quantities of supplies, the division withdrew and fought several rearguard actions. These included fighting at Landrecies, France, on 25 August; the rearguard affair of Le Grand Fayt the following day; and the rearguard actions of Villers-Cotterêts on 1 September. After a retreat, the division arrived at Fontenay, near Paris, on 5 September. Owing to a strategic change in the Anglo-French and German dispositions, the BEF was ordered to counter-attack during the First Battle of the Marne. With the exception of skirmishing, the division saw little fighting. They advanced after the retreating Germans, who had been defeated largely by the French. The division fought several actions against German rearguards during early September. It then fought in the First Battle of the Aisne, which saw the first trench networks begun. It suffered 843 casualties and upwards of 1,000 more were recorded as missing. During the First Battle of Ypres, which now saw both sides entrenched within extensive networks, the division fought numerous actions. In five weeks of battle, the division suffered 5,769 casualties and was reduced to 11,500 men. This brought the division&#x27;s total casualties in 1914 to 10,069. For the rest of the year, the division rested, refitted, undertook training, manned and repaired trenches, and engaged in mutual artillery bombardments. On 3 December the division was reviewed by George V and the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII). The latter returned to stay with the division later in the month, for two days, and reviewed troops in the trenches.

===1915===
During February 1915 the division launched minor attacks and captured several German positions. Trench raids followed, until the 2nd Division took part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March, and suffered over 600 casualties. Trench raids were sandwiched between the division&#x27;s activities in the Battle of Festubertpart of the Second Battle of Artoisin May, and the Battle of Loos (September–October). The bloody fighting of the former saw minor advances made, heavy casualties inflicted on the Germans, and a further 5,446 divisional casualties. At Loos the division deployed chemical weapons for the first time. Due to light wind the gas clouds hung along the division&#x27;s line. The first day&#x27;s attack had mixed results, and ranged from an attack that stalled as soon as the men left their trenches, to sections of the German first line of trenches being captured. Afterwards, minor attacks were launched and German counter-attacks fended off. By the end of the battle the division had lost 3,400 men with the majority inflicted on the first day.

===1916===
In early 1916 the division played a minor defensive role during the German attack on Vimy Ridge. The next major action came during the summer of 1916, when the division fought in the Battle of the Somme, in particular the Battles of Delville Wood, Guillemont and Ancre. The division entered the offensive on 26 July to retake Deville Wood, which had been captured and then lost to a German counter-attack. In a two-day battle the division cleared the wood. It fended off several German counter-attacks over the following days. On 30 July the division launched an attack to capture Guillemont and the nearby Falfemont Farm. these actions met with mixed results. After five days of fighting, by 31 July, the division had suffered over 3,000 casualties and reported that only one battalion was ready for further offensive operations. The division remained on the line, subject to heavy shelling and trench raids, before it renewed efforts to take Guillemont on 8 August. This effort, alongside the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, lasted through 9 August and failed. The division was relieved and moved to a different sector of the front. It engaged in mutual bombardments and trench raids. On 13 November the Battle of Ancre began and was the final stage of the Somme fighting. The division assisted in the Capture of Beaumont-Hamel, and suffered almost 3,000 casualties. With the conclusion of the Somme offensive, the division was withdrawn from the line for rest and to train.

===1917===
During the opening months of 1917 the division conducted trench raids and minor attacks in the Ancre Valley. On 16 March the Germans undertook a planned retreat to the Hindenburg Line, and the division advanced after them. In April the division took part in the Battle of Arras, the British part of the Nivelle offensive. In particular, the division fought between 27 and 29 April, in the Battle of Arleux, and between 3 and 4 May in the Battle of the Scarpe. After a period of rest and training the division returned to the frontline and re-engaged in trench warfare. In October the additions to the division were put through intensive musketry training to bring them up the standard of the remaining pre-war regulars. The division started to enter the trenches on the front, during the Battle of Cambrai on 27 November. On the tenth day of the battle, 30 November, the division fought in a defensive action against a determined German counter-attack. Results of the fighting were mixed: some units held their positions, and others were forced back up to . During the fighting, one battery of eight machine-guns fired 70,000 rounds and another two batteries fired 100,000 between them. The division suffered around 2,000 casualties during the day, and included the entire DCompany of the 13th Battalion, Essex Regiment being killed or taken prisoner. For the remainder of the year, the division manned the front and engaged in trench warfare. Total casualties for 1917 amounted to 8,770.

===1918===
By 1918 the number of front-line infantry within the British Army in France had decreased because of casualties and a lack of eligible reinforcements, leading to a manpower crisis. To consolidate manpower and to increase the ratio of machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was reduced from twelve to nine; with each brigade being reduced from four to three battalions. This reduced the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. For the 2nd Division, this change took place in February when three battalions were disbanded. The troops from one were redistributed to other units within the division, while the others left. Major-General Cecil Pereira, the division&#x27;s commander during this period, said &quot;The old soldiers who have survived many a fight are very hard hit by this.&quot; During the opening months of the year, the division again manned the frontline. Its last week in the line, which ended on 20 March, saw the division suffer 3,000 casualties from the German use of gas.

On 21 March Germany launched Operation Michael. This attack, which became the opening salvo of their spring offensive, aimed to deliver a single, decisive, war-winning blow. The Germans intended to strike the southern British flank, to separate the British and French armies and then move north to engage the bulk of the British forces in France in a battle of annihilation. The aim was to inflict such a defeat upon the British that the country would abandon the war, which in turn would force the French to sue for peace. As a result, the greatly weakened division reentered the line on 21 March and engaged in heavy fighting through April. When the division was relieved on 4 April it had suffered 4,000 casualties and been reduced to a fighting strength of around 6,000. Wyrall wrote, &quot;fighting divisions with such fine records as that held by the 2nd Division were not allowed long out of the line&quot;. Consequently, the division returned to the frontline by 15 April, and was soon engaged in more back and forth fighting. By 6 June the German offensive had ended. The division rebuilt its strength, trained, and tutored newly arrived American troops.

On 8 August the Allied armies launched the Battle of Amiens that began the Hundred Days Offensive, the culminating offensive of the war. On 21 August the division took part in the Third Battle of Albert, part of the Second Battle of the Somme, and liberated several villages. This was followed by fighting at Arras, between 2–3 September, and then an advance to the Canal du Nord. Over the course of the rest of the month, the division took part in preliminary operations for the Battle of Havrincourt and then the Battle of the Canal du Nord. In October the division fought at Second Battle of Cambrai and liberated the village of Forenville. By this point of the offensive, divisional casualties had reached 3,900. The Battle of the Selle followed, between 17 and 25 October, and the division reached the outskirts of Forêt de Mormal. Wyrall noted that some of the division&#x27;s old hands had last marched through this forest in 1914. The division carried out its last trench raid of the war on 1 November, before it moved into reserve and ended the war near Le Quesnoy, France. Casualties in the final year of the war amounted to 10,201. Don Farr, a historian, wrote the division had &quot;an excellent reputation&quot; and continued &quot;to be rated as one of the BEF&#x27;s best&quot; throughout the war.

==Inter-war period==
After the conclusion of fighting, the division advanced into Germany to join the occupation force, the British Army of the Rhine. It entered Germany on 9 December and arrived between Düren and Cologne on 27 December. On 17 February 1919 the division was demobilised. The six regular army battalions within the division, along with the artillery and one engineer unit, were ordered home. The division, with the troops remaining in Germany, was re-designated as the Light Division and the 2nd Division ceased to exist. On 28 June 1919 the 2nd Division was re-formed in Aldershot, and included the same brigades as before the First World War.

==Second World War==
===Battle of France and home defence===
On 3 September 1939 the UK declared war on Germany, in response to the German invasion of Poland. The division landed at Cherbourg on 21 September 1939 and arrived on the Franco–Belgian border on 3 October. Along with the three other divisions of the BEF, it was based east of Lille. During the rest of the year and into 1940, the division trained and assisted in the construction of field fortifications. David Fraser, a historian and former British general, wrote that the regular formations of the BEF were well-trained in small arms, but lacked tactical skill. Though mobile, the formations lacked specialist weapons, ammunition, spare parts, and communication equipment because of the budget cuts of the inter-war period.
On 10 May 1940 Germany invaded Belgium. In response Anglo–French armies moved into Belgium in accordance with the Allied Dyle Plan. The division reached the River Dyle without difficulties. Although the division achieved tactical success in its first action on 15 May, strategic developments forced the BEF withdraw the next day. The division retreated within 27 hours. As the strategic situation grew worse, several divisions were ordered to form a cordon around the BEF&#x27;s line of retreat. The La Bassée Canal and the river Aa, in France, were the only defensible positions that covered the BEF&#x27;s southern and western flank. The 2nd Division defended part of the canal and engaged in several actions on 25–26 May. On 26 May, with the majority of the BEF bound within a closing perimeter on the French coast and lacking the ability to hold the position, the decision was made to evacuate from Dunkirk, the only remaining port in British hands. The 2nd Division was ordered to maintain its position at the canal, to allow other formations to retreat. Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, a historian, wrote this was &quot;the most difficult assignment handed to any unit in the BEF&quot; and that the difficulty of this task &quot;can be gauged by the small number of soldiers who returned home&quot;. On 28 May, the 2nd Division was assailed by the 3rd and 7th Panzer Divisions, the SS Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, and also came under air attack. The heavy fighting saw the 2nd Division reduced from 13,000 men to around 2,500, those who were not killed were taken prisoner by the Germans. By the time the 5th Brigade&#x27;s 1st Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders was evacuated, it had been reduced to 79 men. To this point in the campaign, this was the highest number of casualties suffered by a single battalion within the BEF. After the fighting had ended, 97 members of the 2nd Division were murdered in the Le Paradis massacre. Lionel Ellis, who wrote the volume focused on the BEF in France for the History of the Second World War, stated the division &quot;had indeed sacrificed itself to keep open the line of retirement&quot;, delayed the Germans, and ensured French formations were not trapped. During the night of 28–29 May, the division withdrew into the Dunkirk perimeter, from where it evacuated.

On returning to England the division was dispatched to Yorkshire. Through April 1942, the division was assigned to the defence of the county. It was also rebuilt, trained, and assisted in coastal defence duties. On 15 April the 16,000-strong division left the UK. It had been intended that the division to reinforce the British Eighth Army in the North African Western Desert. In May the convoy was ordered to sail for British India because of increasing civil tension there.

===India and Burma===
The division arrived in July 1942, and was based initially at Poona before it established itself at Ahmednagar. In Asia, following the Empire of Japan&#x27;s entry into the war in December 1941 and the conclusion of the Malayan campaign and the Battle of Singapore, the Burma campaign was the primary theatre of operations where British forces were engaged against those of Japan. Because of the logistical issues at the time, the division could not be employed in Burma. Instead, the division formed part of the British strategic reserve in Asia. In July, as a result of the German advance into the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union, the 2nd and the 5th Divisions were selected to be deployed to the Kingdom of Iraq if German forces entered the Middle East. Concurrently, an Axis advance into Egypt was stopped at the First Battle of El Alamein, in July 1942. In August the two divisions were again offered as reinforcements to move into the Middle East. No move was undertaken, as a result of the defeat of the Axis forces at the Second Battle of El Alamein (October and November 1942). This battle followed the defeat of German forces during the Battle of Stalingrad (August 1942 – February 1943), removed the threat to the Middle East. In November 1942 the division&#x27;s 6th Infantry Brigade was detached and assigned to several British Indian Army formations, and fought in the Arakan Campaign in Burma. It returned to the division in June 1943.

The 2nd Division spent 1942 to 1944 training at its Ahmednagar base. It dispatched one brigade at a time to conduct jungle warfare training near Belgaum, and also sent troops to Bombay to undertake combined operations training. Amphibious warfare training took place as well, as the division has been assigned to take part in Operation Anakim. This operation, scheduled for November 1943, was a proposed landing that would take place at Rangoon as part of a larger effort to retake Burma. Developments around the other theatres of the war caused a shortage of shipping to India, which resulted in the continued postponement to this operation. During 1943, the division made preliminary preparations for a move to Tehran, Iran, but ultimately did not go. Shifting Allied plans for the reconquest of Burma saw the division, by late 1943, assigned to Operation Bullfrog. Rather than an assault on Rangoon, this proposed amphibious landing would take place near Akyab, on the Arakan coastline of Burma. Like Anakim, this would be in conjunction with a new offensive into Burma. By January 1944 this and all amphibious operations had been cancelled along with the proposed deployment of the division.

The following month, the British frontline started to prepare for an expected Japanese offensive. In March Japan invaded India, and then besieged Imphal and Kohima. In response the 2nd Division was assigned to the British Fourteenth Army and ordered to move to Chittagong. As a result of the fighting at Kohima, the division was diverted to the province of Assam. After a move of , the division launched a counter-attack on 12 April. In conjunction with the 7th Indian Infantry Division, the division broke the Japanese siege of Kohima and forced them to retreat. Advancing towards Imphal, the division fought several actions with Japanese forces. On 20 June the division linked up with British Indian forces who had advanced from Imphal, which ended that siege. In the course of this fighting, the division assisted in the destruction of the Japanese 31st Division, and suffered 2,125 casualties.

British infantry reinforcements within India were scarce. To maintain the division in the field and make up losses, several British anti-aircraft units in the theatre were disbanded. This released around 3,500 British soldiers, of whom 2,500 were dispatched to the 2nd Division. In November the division started to move towards Burma, and by 7 December was concentrated across the border at Yazagyo. As part of Operation Capital, the 2nd Division then advanced and captured several important airfields that were required for the supply effort for the advance to Mandalay. At the end of 1944 the division was near Shwebo, north of Mandalay. Heavy rain delayed progress, and the city was not captured until 11 January 1945. In the opening three months of 1945, the division took part in the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay. This culminated with the capture of the latter on 21 March, in part by the division. While the main advance proceeded to Rangoon, the division cleared bypassed Japanese positions near Mandalay. As the reconquest of Burma entered its final stage, those forces that were not going to be used were withdrawn to India. The 2nd and the 36th Infantry Divisions were selected to be relieved because of the increasing shortage of British manpower in Asia, which impeded the ability to maintain them at full strength. This was, in part, the result of the &quot;python&quot; scheme that aimed to repatriate soldiers who had served in Asia for at least three years and eight months back to the UK. The 2nd Division left their transport in Burma, and the troops were flown to India between 10 and 20 April.

In India, the division was transported to Calcutta, where it was re-equipped and assigned to Operation Draculaan amphibious assault on Rangoon. In the event, the city was liberated by other forces and the 2nd Division did not depart for the port. With Burma retaken, the British set their sights on the recapture of Malaya. An amphibious landing, codenamed Operation Zipper, aimed to land forces along the Malayan coastline and then liberate Singapore. The 2nd Division was not chosen to take part in this operation, as 10,000 of its troops were due to repatriated during 1945, but did provide communication and administrative assistance. The surrender of Japan forestalled this endeavour, and the division ended the war back at Poona.

==The post-war and Cold War period==
At Poona the division was joined by the 36th Infantry Division. In August 1945 the 2nd Division absorbed the 36th Division, and the latter then ceased to exist. The 5th Infantry Brigade left the division and was dispatched to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. In November, the 2nd Division arrived in Malaya. It occupied Singapore and key locations throughout Malaya in an effort to maintain law and order, which had broken down following the Japanese surrender. The division remained in Malaya until 1946, when it was disbanded.

At the end of the Second World War the UK was allocated an occupation zone in northwest Germany and formed a new British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) to administer its occupation forces. The 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division was part of this army until February 1947. At that point it was renumbered as the 2nd Infantry Division. Some troops from Malaya, who had been part of the earlier 2nd Division, were shipped to Germany to bring the new division up to strength. The division remained part of the BAOR until the 1980s. The division was headquartered at Düsseldorf, and later at Bunde. In 1958 the &quot;infantry&quot; designation was dropped from the division&#x27;s title. In the early 1960s the division, with its headquarters at Lubbecke, comprised the 6th and 12th Infantry Brigade Groups.

By the 1970s the UK had to reconcile its decreased resources with its commitments, as well as the increased threat from the Soviet Union. The 1975 Mason Review, a Government white paper that outlined a new defence policy, called for BAOR to be restructured. This included the elimination of the brigade level of command. This political change coincided with a BAOR doctrinal change that had started in the 1960s, and was pioneered by the 1st Division in the early 1970s. The restructure increased BAOR to four divisions, for the first time since the end of the 1950s, each composed of two armoured regiments, three mechanised infantry battalions, and two artillery regiments. On 1 September 1976, as part of this restructure, the 2nd Division was re-designated as the 2nd Armoured Division.

==2nd Armoured Division, 1976–1982==


The 2nd Armoured Division was the first of the four BAOR divisions to be reorganised. After the process was completed, it was 8,600 men strong, and equipped with 132 Chieftain tanks (with 12 other tanks in reserve). In a time of war, the division was expected to be reinforced by reserve and Territorial Army (TA) personnel who would arrive from the UK. These troops would be assigned to the division&#x27;s existing units. For example, an infantry battalion was around 650 strong during peace. During a crisis, the reinforcements would increase the battalion to around 800 strong. With this method, the division would increase to 14,000. The divisional headquarters was based in Lübbecke, West Germany, and its signal regiment was in Bünde. As well as tanks, the division had three mechanised infantry battalions with the troops carried in FV432 armoured personnel carriers; an armoured reconnaissance regiment equipped with FV101 Scorpions and FV107 Scimitars; two regiments of self-propelled artillery; an anti-tank battery equipped with Swingfire anti-tank missiles; anti-aircraft units equipped with Blowpipe missiles; an aviation regiment equipped with scout helicopters; and support services: divisional engineers, medical, provost; transport, ordnance, and field workshop units. The actual units that comprised the division were not fixed. During the Cold War, the British Army rotated units through BAOR. For example, infantry battalions would generally serve a four-year tour with BAOR, before they were rotated to another theatre; armoured units could serve up to eight years. A number of the division&#x27;s units were also rotated through Northern Ireland. Units sent there were a constant drain on the whole of BAOR. For example, the 2nd Armoured Division Engineer Regiment was deployed to Northern Ireland in December 1979.

BAOR was tasked with conducting &quot;a mobile and intense armoured battle&quot; against invading Soviet forces. To conduct this battle, doctrine required the division to fight a mobile defensive battle by defending key attack routes that Soviet armoured forces would more than likely use. The Soviet forces would then be lured into a killing zone where they would suffer disproportionate losses at the hands of British anti-tank guided missile-equipped infantry and tanks in hull-down defensive positions. The division would keep moving, fighting this aggressive delaying battle from the East German border. The doctrine envisioned that this attritional battle would allow the BAOR to resist a Soviet advance and buy enough time for one of several contingencies to be implemented. This would be either a diplomatic solution the arrival of reinforcements to allow further conventional warfare to be maintained, or a threat to use tactical nuclear weapons.

With the removal of the brigade level, it was intended that the division could form up to five battlegroups with each based around the headquarters of either an armoured regiment or infantry battalion. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The reforms intended that the divisional commander would oversee these battlegroups, but early training showed this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (wartime strength) including two brigadiers, who would each command a flexible task force that would be formed by the general officer commanding (GOC). The 2nd Armoured Division&#x27;s task forces were Task Force Charlie and Task Force Delta. The task force approach allowed the GOC to tailor his forces to meet unforeseen events and execute the killing area doctrine. These task forces were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure, and they had no administrative responsibilities. In structuring the division in this manner, it allowed a reduction of 700 men. David John Anthony Stone, a historian, commented the system was &quot;designed to allow the commander maximum flexibility and [to] take precise account of the operational or tactical task to be achieved&quot;.

In November 1976 the BAOR held Exercise Spearpoint76. It was designed to test the 2nd Armoured Division and included troops from Denmark and the United States. The exercise demonstrated the improvement of the new organisation, but highlighted that the divisional headquarters would become inefficient as combat fatigue took over if there was prolonged combat. Following the exercise, further refinements to the organisation took place into 1977, and more armour and infantry units were transferred, bringing the formation up to strength. The Task Force concept lasted until the end of the decade, when it was replaced with brigade commands as it had not met expectations. The division then comprised the 4th and the 12th Armoured Brigades.

In 1981 John Nott, the Secretary of State for Defence for the government elected in 1979, wrote the 1981 Defence White Paper. It, like the Mason Review, aimed to balance the British military in line with the nation&#x27;s financial resources. Nott&#x27;s paper called for the BAOR to be restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades, into a force of three divisions of three brigades. The intent was to save manpower and money, while only losing one divisional headquarters. Nott called for a new division to be formed in the UK, which would be made up primarily of TA personnel. The new formation would reinforce BAOR on the outbreak of war. In July 1981, the 2nd Armoured Division was chosen as the formation to be disbanded. In December 1982 the division ceased to exist, and its personnel, equipment, and units were dispersed among other BAOR formations.

==End of the Cold War and into the 21st century==
On 1 January 1983 the 2nd Infantry Division was re-formed, based at Imphal Barracks, in York, England. The re-formed division was assigned the territorial 15th Brigade at Alanbrooke Barracks, Topcliffe, North Yorkshire; the territorial 49th Brigade, based in Nottingham; the regular army 24th Brigade, at Catterick Garrison; and the 29th Engineer Brigade, based in Newcastle upon Tyne.

Following the end of the Cold War, the division was disbanded in early 1992 as part of the British Government&#x27;s Options for Change plan. In 1994 the 2nd Division was re-established in York as a training formation and replaced the existing Eastern District. In 1998 the division was 28,500 strong. As part of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the British Army restructured its forces within the UK to cut costs. In line with this, in April 2000, the 2nd Division absorbed Scotland District. The division headquarters was then moved to Craigiehall, near Edinburgh. The division then comprised the 15th (North East) Brigade based in York; the 42nd (North West) Brigade based in Preston; the 51st (Scottish) Brigade based in Stirling; and the 52nd Infantry Brigade based in Edinburgh. Elements of the division were also based in Chester. The division was around 2,100 men strong in 2002 and was responsible for the administration and training of soldiers in the north of England and in Scotland. If war broke out, it was to expand to 16,000–18,000 men, in line with the army&#x27;s combat formations of that time. In April 2012, as part of a further restructure, the division was disbanded.

==Insignia==
In 1916, during the First World War, the British Army divisions adopted formation signs. The design the 2nd Division chose, represented &quot;The Second Division of the First Corps&quot;, which was indicated by two white stars (the division) either side of a single larger red star that represented ICorps. In 1940, during the Second World War, a new insignia was adopted. Major-General Charles Loyd, who had taken command of the division in 1939, designed it. He had previously commanded the 1st (Guards) Brigade before his appointment to the division, and they had used a single key as a brigade insignia. Loyd updated that design for his new command, by adding a second key. The design was used throughout the Second World War, through the Cold War, and until the division was disbanded in 2012. It has also been highlighted that the insignia resembles the coat of arms of the Archbishop of York, and could reference troop recruitment in that area.

==Memorials==
There are three monuments to 2nd Division in Aldershot, the division&#x27;s peacetime base for many years. A World War I memorial cross was erected at the junction of Hospital Road and Knollys Road in 1923. The design incorporated the division&#x27;s insignia as the memorial rested on a central red star flanked by two white stars. A memorial tablet was placed in the Royal Garrison Church, listing the units that fought with the division during World War I, and also incorporating the three stars. A set of memorial gates to 1st and 2nd Divisions was unveiled on 29 July 1958.

While the division was stationed in Malay after World War II, the Kohima War Cemetery was established in India and dedicated to the division.

On 24 June 1987 Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a memorial to the division in York, its later base, at the site of the medieval palace of the Archbishop of York.

<doc id="571162" wikidata="Q223165" url="?curid=571162" title="3rd (UK) Division">
<text>The 3rd (United Kingdom) Division, also known as The Iron Division, is a regular army division of the British Army. It was created in 1809 by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, as part of the Anglo-Portuguese Army, for service in the Peninsular War, and was known as the Fighting 3rd under Sir Thomas Picton during the Napoleonic Wars. The division fought at the Battle of Waterloo, as well as during the Crimean War and the Second Boer War. As a result of bitter fighting in 1916, during the First World War, the division became referred to as the 3rd (Iron) Division, or the Iron Division or Ironsides. During the Second World War, the division (now known as the 3rd Infantry Division) fought in the Battle of France including a rearguard action during the Dunkirk Evacuation, and played a prominent role in the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944. The division was to have been part of a proposed Commonwealth Corps, formed for a planned invasion of Japan in 1945–46, and later served in the British Mandate of Palestine. During the Second World War, the insignia became the &quot;pattern of three&quot; — a black triangle trisected by an inverted red triangle.

==Napoleonic Wars==

The division was part of the Allied British and Portuguese forces that took part in the Peninsular War. It fought at the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810, the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro in May 1811 and the Battle of El Bodón in September 1811, before further combat at the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January 1812, the Siege of Badajoz in March 1812 and the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. It also fought at the Siege of Burgos in September 1812 and the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813. It then pursued the French army into France and saw action at the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813, the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813 and the Battle of the Nive in December 1813. After that it fought at the Battle of Orthez in February 1814 and the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814.

According to Picton, the fighting by the 3rd was so intense at the Battle of Vitoria, that the division lost 1,800 men (over one third of all Allied losses at the battle) having taken a key bridge and village, where they were subjected to fire by 40 to 50 cannons, and a counter-attack on the right flank (which was open because the rest of the army had not kept pace). The 3rd held their ground and pushed on with other divisions to capture the village of Arinez.
The 3rd Division was also present at the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo in the Waterloo campaign under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Alten K.C.B. (Count Carl von Alten).

==Crimean War==
The 3rd Division took part in the Crimean War and fought in the Battle of Alma and the Siege of Sevastopol. It was under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Richard England.

==Second Boer War==
During the Second Boer War (1899–1902) the division began under the command of General Gatacre. In 1902 the army was restructured, and a 3rd Infantry division was established permanently at Bordon as part of the 1st Army Corps, comprising the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades.

==First World War==
During the First World War the 3rd Division was a permanently established Regular Army division that was amongst the first to be sent to France at the outbreak of the war as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The 3rd Division served on the Western Front in France and Belgium for four years, from 1914 to 1918. During this time, it was nicknamed &quot;The Iron Division&quot;. Its first commander during the war, Major-General Hubert Hamilton, was killed by shellfire near Béthune in October 1914. The division served in many major battles of the war, including the Battle of Mons and the subsequent Great Retreat, and later the First Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Passchendaele.

==Inter-war period==
After the end of the First World War, the division was stationed in southern England where it formed part of Southern Command. In 1937, one of its brigades, the 9th Infantry Brigade, was commanded by Brigadier Bernard Montgomery. He assumed command of the 3rd Division shortly before Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939.

==Second World War==
===France 1940===

The 3rd Infantry Division, under the command of Major-General Bernard Montgomery was sent overseas to France in late September 1939, just under a month after the outbreak of the Second World War. There the division became part of Lieutenant General Alan Brooke&#x27;s II Corps of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).

In May 1940, after several months of relative inactivity, the German Army launched its attack in the west which resulted in the BEF being split up from the French Army, evacuated from Dunkirk. Due to Montgomery&#x27;s strict training regime, the 3rd Division suffered comparatively few casualties and earned a reputation as one of the best British divisions in France. During the evacuation Montgomery was promoted to temporary command of II Corps and Brigadier Kenneth Anderson took temporary control of the division before, in July, Major General James Gammell assumed command.

For over a year after Dunkirk the composition of 3rd Division remained largely unchanged (except that the motorcycle battalion was converted into 3rd (RNF) Reconnaissance Regiment, Reconnaissance Corps). Then, in September 1941, the 7th Guards Brigade was transferred to help create the Guards Armoured Division, and, in November, the 37th Infantry Brigade Group joined the 3rd Division and was renumbered 7th Brigade with the following composition: The brigade anti-tank companies were disbanded during 1941 and 92nd (Loyals) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, formerly the 7th Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire), joined the division in March 1942. In June 1942, 3rd Infantry Division was reorganised as a &#x27;Mixed&#x27; Division, with 33rd Tank Brigade replacing 7th Infantry Brigade. By early 1943, the experiment with &#x27;mixed&#x27; divisions was abandoned, and division reverted to being an infantry formation, 33rd Tank Brigade being replaced by 185th Infantry Brigade.

===France 1944 ===

The 3rd British Infantry Division was the first British formation to land at Sword Beach on D-Day, 6 June 1944, as part of the invasion of Normandy, part of the larger Operation Overlord. For the assault landing, 3rd British Division was organised as a Division Group, with other formations temporarily under its command. These included 27th Armoured Brigade (Sherman DD amphibious tanks of 13/18th Hussars, and the Sherman tanks of the Staffordshire Yeomanry and East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry) , 1st Special Service Brigade and No. 41 (Royal Marine) Commando, with 5th Royal Marine Independent Armoured Support Battery (Centaur IV close support tanks), and specialist units of the 79th Armoured Division: 22nd Dragoons (Sherman Crab mine clearing tanks), Royal Engineers 77 and 79 Assault Squadrons of 5th Assault Regiment (Churchill AVRE tanks for obstacle demolition).

The division&#x27;s own artillery were all self-propelled (the artillery field regiments with M7 Priest; the anti-tank regiment: M10 tank destroyer) and the SP field guns and RM Centaurs were able to fire from their landing craft during the run-in to the beach. In addition, 3rd Division had 101 Beach Sub-Area HQ and No. 5 and No. 6 Beach groups under command for the assault phase: these included additional engineers, transport, pioneers, medical services and vehicle recovery sections which would hold and manage the beach landing area after the initial assault.

The 3rd Division&#x27;s brigades were organised as brigade groups for the assault, with 8 Brigade Group making the first landing, followed by 185 Brigade Group and 9 Brigade Group in succession during the morning and early afternoon.

The 3rd Infantry Division fought through the Battle for Caen, in Operation Charnwood and Operation Goodwood.

=== Low countries and Germany ===
The division participated in the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine and fought in the Netherlands and Belgium and later the Allied invasion of Germany. For the campaign in Normandy, the division was commanded by Major-General Tom Rennie until he was wounded on 13 June 1944; Major-General &#x27;Bolo&#x27; Whistler, a highly popular commander, took command on 23 June 1944. During the campaign in Normandy, two posthumous Victoria Crosses were awarded to units under its command. In August 1944, corporal Sidney Bates of 1st Battalion, Royal Norfolk Regiment and in March 1945 Private James Stokes of the 2nd Battalion, King&#x27;s Shropshire Light Infantry, both units part of the 185th Infantry Brigade.
During the often intense fighting from Sword Beach to Bremen, the 3rd Division suffered 2,586 killed with over 12,000 wounded. Following the German surrender, the division moved towards central Germany. It was then ordered to Berlin, to become part of the Western Allied garrison, but before a move could be made it was sent to Belgium. It was intended that the division would be flown to the United States, from where it would join the assault on Japan. With the surrender of Japan and the end of the Second World War, the move was cancelled.

==Post-war and Cold War==

The division remained in Europe until October 1945, when it left for the Middle East. After spending time in Egypt and undertaking internal security operations during the Jewish insurgency, it was disbanded in June 1947. Sources differ on the specifics. The Imperial War Museum stated it was disbanded in Palestine while historians Lord and Watson stated the division first returned to the UK in April 1947 before being disbanded. However, they also note that at least one source (although not specified by the authors) claimed that the division was still active in Palestine until February 1948.

With the outbreak of the Korean War and the need for a divisional-sized strategic reserve based in the UK, the 3rd Infantry Division was reformed at Colchester, England, on 14 December 1950. In April 1951, the division helped form the signals regiment for the 1st Commonwealth Division, which served in the Korean War. In November, the entire formation was dispatched to Egypt to garrison the Suez Canal Zone. During this period, the Egyptian government abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which was the basis for British troops to remain in the canal area. The ensuing political landscape saw increased animosity to the British presence, eventually resulting in an agreement to withdraw. The division departed for the UK during 1954, where it returned to Colchester and its role as the British Army&#x27;s strategic reserve. March 1955 saw troops deployed to Cyprus, during the Cyprus Emergency. The following year, the division was mobilised for Operation Musketeer, the attack on Egypt during the Suez Crisis. In the event of a successful invasion, the division would have severed as a follow-up formation and occupied Port Said. Only the divisional headquarters was dispatched, and the division was ultimately not deployed. In April 1959, the divisional headquarters moved from Colchester to Bulford.

In 1961, elements of the division were dispatched to Kuwait to deter an Iraqi invasion; signals personnel were sent to assist with the British Cameroons referendum; and other troops were sent to Kenya. Exercises in Libya followed in 1963, which also established the division in an air-portable role. Elements were dispatched to Cyprus, in February 1964, to support the forming United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus. That lasted until August, when the UN force was activated. On 1 April 1968, the Army Strategic Command was formed in the UK, with a goal of supporting NATO forces from as far north as Norway to as far south as Turkey; to provide internal security operations world-wide; and to undertake limited operations in conjunction with allies. The 3rd Division was assigned to this command, and from 1969 onwards was the primary British formation that would reinforce European-based NATO forces in the event of the Cold War heating up. Under Operation Banner, the division also deployed troops to Northern Ireland for four-month tours of duty. During 1974, the division returned to Cyprus in response to the Turkish invasion.

==Armoured division==
The 1975 Mason Review, a government white paper, outlined a new defence policy that removed the UK-based divisional-sized strategic reserve and also resulted in the restructure of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). With its role eliminated, the 3rd Division was disbanded. It was reformed in Soest, Germany, on 1 September 1977, as the 3rd Armoured Division. Its reformation increased the BAOR to four divisions, for the first time since the end of the 1950s. Each division consisted of two armoured regiments, three mechanised infantry battalions, and two artillery regiments.

The Mason Review removed brigades and replaced them with a concept of task forces or battlegroups. It was intended that the division could form up to five battlegroups, with each commanded by either an armoured regiment or an infantry battalion. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The divisional commander (general officer commanding (GOC)) would oversee these battlegroups, but early training showed this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (wartime strength) and included two brigadiers. Each officer would command a flexible task force, which consisted of the battlegroups the GOC had formed. The division&#x27;s task forces were named Task Force Echo and Task Force Foxtrot. These were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure and had no administrative responsibilities. The approach intended to provide greater flexibility in tailoring forces to meet unforeseen events and allow for an overall reduction in the size of a division by 700 men. The task force concept was dropped by the end of the decade, having been deemed to have not met expectations. The division then comprised the 6th and the 33rd Armoured Brigades, with each made up of two mechanised infantry battalions and one armoured regiment.

In 1981, John Nott, the Secretary of State for Defence for the government elected in 1979, announced the 1981 Defence White Paper. It, like the Mason Review, aimed to balance the British military in line with the nation&#x27;s financial resources and save manpower. Resultingly, the BAOR was restructured from four armoured divisions of two brigades, into a force of three divisions of three brigades. The division then comprised the 4th (based in Münster), the 6th (Soest), and the 33rd Armoured Brigades (Paderborn). During the 1980s, the 33rd Armoured Brigade joined the 4th Armoured Division and in exchange the 3rd Armoured Division received the 19th Infantry Brigade (Colchester, England). During 1983, the 6th Armoured Brigade converted into the 6th Airmobile Brigade and maintained that role until 1988.

The end of the 1980s saw the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. In July 1990, the British government announced Options for Change. This framework sought to restructure the British military based on the new strategic situation, allow for further cost saving measures to be enacted, and to reduce the BAOR by half. During September and October 1992, the division relocated from Germany to Bulford, Wiltshire where it was reorganised as a mechanized infantry division known as the 3rd (United Kingdom) Division.

==Post–Cold War==
Following its reorganisation, the 3rd (United Kingdom) Division (also referred to as the 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division) was assigned to the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, a newly formed NATO HQ that was administered by the UK. Around 8,400 strong, it comprised the 1st (Tidworth) and the 19th (Mechanised) Brigades (Catterick), in conjunction with the 5th (Airborne) Brigade (Aldershot), the 2nd (National Communications) Brigade (Corsham), and the 43rd (Wessex) Brigade (Exeter). The 1st and 19th Brigades each contained a Challenger 1 tank-equipped armoured regiment, an armoured infantry battalion carried in Warrior tracked armoured vehicles, and two mechanised infantry battalions carried in Saxon armoured personnel carriers. In the event of a major emergency, as part of agreements between the UK and Italy, the division could be reinforced by the 132nd Armored Brigade &quot;Ariete&quot;. During the 1990s, the division deployed troops to Angola, the Falkland Islands, Kosovo, Northern Ireland as part of Operation Banner, and Rwanda. Most notably, in December 1995, following the signing of the Dayton Agreement, the division was the first British formation deployed as part of the Implementation Force to serve as peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina and remained through 1996. The British contribution to this force eventually came under the guidance of the Multi-National Division (South-West), which was administered by the 3rd Division for six months. Command then rotated to the 1st (UK) Armoured Division. During 1999, the 5th Airborne Brigade was converted into the 12th Mechanised Brigade (still based at Aldershot). The division&#x27;s tanks were replaced by 165 Challenger 2s. By the early 2000s, the formation&#x27;s strength ranged from 18–21,600, depending on the source.

==Afghanistan and Iraq==

Following the United States invasion of Afghanistan, in December 2001, the divisional headquarters was dispatched to Kabul as part of the International Security Assistance Force. It oversaw a multinational brigade until command was handed over to other NATO forces. From 2006 onwards, Task Force Helmand (based on a reinforced brigade) was formed to conduct stabilisation and counter-insurgency missions in Helmand Province. Between April and October 2007, the division&#x27;s 12th Mechanised Brigade was deployed to serve as the core of Task Force Helmand; it was replaced by the division&#x27;s newly added 52nd Infantry Brigade from October through to April 2008; the 19th Brigade deployed between April and October 2009; the 4th Mechanised Brigade undertook a tour between April and October 2010; the 12th Brigade returned between April and October 2021; followed by the 4th Brigade (joined the division in 2008) until April 2013; and the division&#x27;s final deployment to Task Force Helmand came between April and October 2013, when then the 1st Brigade was dispatched. The task force was maintained until 2014, consisting of 1st Armoured Division units, when it was disbanded following the British withdrawal.

In June 2003, following the initial stage of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and start of security and stabilisation responsibilities, the 19th Mechanised Brigade was deployed to Basra, Iraq, to replace the 1st (UK) Armoured Division&#x27;s 7th Armoured Brigade. This was followed by the divisional headquarters, which replaced the 1st (UK) Armoured Division on 11 July. The Multi-National Division (South-East) was subsequently formed to oversee all Multi-National Forces in southern Iraq. The British portion of this force was based around a reinforced brigade, which came from different parent formations and were rotated through several deployments. The 3rd Division held operational control of the Multi-National Division until December 2003, when it passed command to other forces. The 3rd Division&#x27;s headquarters undertook additional tours of Iraqi between July 2006 and January 2007 as well as in 2008, during these periods it also controlled the Multi-National Division. Between April and November 2004, the division&#x27;s 1st Mechanised Brigade was dispatched to Iraq under the oversight of the Multi-National Division; the 12th Mechanised Brigade was deployed between April and October 2005; the 19th Brigade between November 2006 and June 2007; the 1st Mechanized Brigade returned between June and December 2007; and the division&#x27;s final deployment, under the oversight of the Multi-National Division, was made by the newly added 4th Mechanised Brigade between December 2007 and June 2008. 

==Army 2020==
On 1 January 2005, the 19th Mechanised Brigade was converted into the 19th Light Brigade. It then moved from Catterick to Northern Ireland in 2008. The following year, the 4th Mechanised Brigade moved from Germany and joined the division. This was followed, during April 2007, with the addition of the 52nd Infantry Brigade. By the late 2000s, the division comprised the 1st Mechanised Brigade (based at Tidworth), the 12th Mechnised Brigade (Aldershot), the 19th Light Brigade, and the 52nd Infantry Brigade (Edinburgh). In 2013, the 19th Brigade was disbanded leaving the division with just four brigades.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010 outlined the Army 2020 plan. This project aimed to restructure the army from one optimized for the War in Afghanistan, to one that was more flexible and included the establishment of a &quot;Reaction Force&quot; and an &quot;Adaptable Force&quot;. The latter would be based around the 1st (United Kingdom) Division, while the 3rd Division would serve as the basis for the Reaction Force. The division&#x27;s new role required it to be held in a state of high readiness, ready to be deployed to undertake operations on short notice, and all its forces were concentrated around the Salisbury Plain Training Area. The restructured division then contained the 1st, 12th, and 20th Brigades. These were all renamed from &quot;Mechanised&quot; brigades to &quot;Armoured Infantry&quot; brigades, with each containing an armoured cavalry regiment for reconnaissance, an armoured regiment equipped with Challenger 2 main battle tanks, two armoured infantry battalions carried in Warriors, and one infantry battalion carried in Mastiff infantry mobility vehicles (this battalion being described as a &#x27;heavy protected mobility&#x27; battalion). The division also included the 101st Logistic Brigade, and could be supported by the 16 Air Assault Brigade as part of the reaction force. By 2016, the division had a strength of around 16,000 personnel.

Further changes occurred following the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review, which resulted in Army 2020 Refine that was implemented in 2019. Army 2020 Refine saw the 1st Artillery Brigade, the 25th Engineer Group, and the 7th Air Defence Group all added to the division.

In 2024, the 7th Air Defence Group was resubordinated to HQ ARRC.

==The Iron Division nickname==
During the First World War, the division obtained the nickname &quot;the ironsides&quot; and &quot;The Iron Division. Norman Scarfe, the divisional historian for the period 1943-1945, argued against a continuation of the nickname beyond the First World War. He wrote that while it was a complement to be associated with the term, it was a nickname &quot;earned by quite different groups of units in quite different circumstances, not by the 3rd Division in its Assault form. &#x27;Ironsides&#x27; is surely another not entirely justifiable reference to East Anglia, where Cromwell did his recruiting; and Iron, a symbol of strength and resolution of the 3rd Division in the Four Years&#x27; War, can also suggest inflexibility and cruelty, rust and robots. The distinction of being British [in comparison to the 3rd Canadian Division], on the other hand, is open to only one interpretation. It is the most suitable of all titles. There was only one 3rd British Division fighting in Europe, and from D-Day until the Germans were defeated the men of the division deserved the honour of their name.&quot; The separation of traditions was also suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel T. F. Furnell, secretary of the Association of the 3rd (Iron) Division, who in a reunion speech to Second World War 3rd Division veterans stated &quot;You of the 3rd British Division have more than lived up to the tradition of the Iron Division.&quot; The Imperial War Museum highlighted that while the nickname was earned during the First World War, it continued on through the Second World War and indicated Major-General Bernard Montgomery (who took command in 1939) referred to the division as such. Per Patrick Delaforce, Montgomery told an officer &quot;I knew it in the last war – it was known as the &#x27;Iron Division&#x27; then and it is going to be known as the &quot;Iron Division&quot; in this war.&quot; The modern-day division still refers to itself as such.

<text>The Virginian Railway was a Class I railroad located in Virginia and West Virginia in the United States. The VGN was created to transport high quality &quot;smokeless&quot; bituminous coal from southern West Virginia to port at Hampton Roads.

==History==

Early in the 20th century, William Nelson Page, a civil engineer and coal mining manager, joined forces with a silent partner, industrialist financier Henry Huttleston Rogers (a principal of Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest men in the world), to develop the Deepwater Railway, a modest 85-mile long short line railroad to access untapped bituminous coal reserves in some of the most rugged sections of southern West Virginia. When Page was blocked by collusion of the bigger railroads, who refused to grant reasonable rates to interchange the coal traffic, he did not quit. As he continued building the original project, to provide their own link, using Rogers&#x27; resources and attorneys they quietly incorporated another intrastate railroad in Virginia, the Tidewater Railway. In this name, they secured the right-of-way needed all the way across Virginia to reach Hampton Roads, where a new coal pier was erected at Sewell&#x27;s Point.

The two projects were legally joined and renamed the Virginian Railway in early 1907. Despite efforts to stop them, they then built the &quot;Mountains to Sea&quot; railroad under the noses of the big railroads and the elite group of a few industrialists (so-called &quot;robber barons&quot;) who controlled them. Completed in 1909, the Virginian Railway was largely financed with Rogers&#x27; personal fortune. It was a modern, well-engineered railroad with all-new infrastructure and could operate more efficiently than its larger competitors.

Throughout a profitable 50-year history, VGN continued the Page-Rogers philosophy of &quot;paying up front for the best.&quot; It achieved best efficiencies in the mountains, rolling piedmont, and flat tidewater terrain. Known for operating some of the largest and best steam, electric, and diesel motive power, it was nicknamed &quot;Richest Little Railroad in the World.&quot; Merged into the Norfolk and Western Railway in 1959, a large portion of the former VGN remains in service in the 21st century for the Norfolk Southern Railway, a Class I railroad headquartered in Atlanta.

==Building the Virginian Railway==
The Virginian Railway (VGN) was conceived early in the 20th century by two men. One was a civil engineer, coal mining manager, and entrepreneur, William Nelson Page. His partner was millionaire industrialist, Henry Huttleston Rogers. Together, they built a well-engineered railroad that was virtually a &quot;conveyor belt on rails&quot; to transport high quality &quot;smokeless&quot; bituminous coal from southern West Virginia to port on Hampton Roads, near Norfolk, Virginia.

The Virginian Railway transported coal from West Virginia Coalfields to ports in Hampton Roads. It grew in spite of competition from monopolies. While other railroads curved and went over hills to get to each town, the Virginian was built mostly for coal and was built as straight and steady in grade as possible.

===Partnership: The idea man from Ansted and a self-made multi-millionaire===
William Nelson Page (1854–1932) was a civil engineer and entrepreneur. Page, who was born in Virginia and educated at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, originally came to West Virginia in the 1870s to help build the double-track Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) in the New and Kanawha River Valleys.

A colorful man by all accounts, Colonel Page, as he came to be known, soon became involved in many coal and related enterprises in the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia, settling in the tiny mountain hamlet of Ansted in Fayette County, West Virginia.

Col. Page was one of the more successful men who developed West Virginia&#x27;s rich bituminous coal fields in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and built railroads to transport the coal. With his training and experience as a civil engineer, Page was well prepared to utilize southern West Virginia&#x27;s resources. Former West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew &quot;the land as a farmer knows his fields.&quot; He was also an energetic entrepreneur. Author H. Reid summed it up by labeling Col. Page &quot;The idea man from Ansted.&quot;

Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840–1909) was a financier and industrialist who was raised in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, the son of Rowland Rogers, a former ship captain, bookkeeper, and grocer. He began working while young, working part-time in his father&#x27;s grocery store and delivering newspapers. After graduating from high school, Rogers worked as a brakeman on the Fairhaven Branch Railroad while saving his money. In 1861 he and a friend went to the mountains of Pennsylvania, and helped develop oil and natural gas resources there during the U.S. Civil War, eventually becoming one of the key men with John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Trust and a multi-millionaire. One of the wealthiest men in the US, Rogers was an energetic entrepreneur, much like the younger Page, and was also involved in many rail and mineral development projects.


Rogers became acquainted with Page while the latter was president of Gauley Mountain Coal Company, among many other ventures. Page knew of rich untapped bituminous coal fields lying between the New River Valley and the lower Guyandotte River in southern West Virginia in an area not yet reached by C&amp;O and its major competitor, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway (N&amp;W). While the bigger railroads were preoccupied in developing nearby areas and shipping coal via rail to Hampton Roads, Page formed a plan to take advantage of the undeveloped coal lands, with Rogers and several others as investors. A powerful partnership had been formed.

=== Deepwater Railway and Tidewater Railway ===
Originally, the Page-Rogers scheme was a short line railroad, the Deepwater Railway, formed in 1898, an intrastate line intended to be only in West Virginia. Eventually, after establishing relationships to interchange coal traffic with the bigger railroads failed, the Deepwater&#x27;s right-of-way was extended to reach the West Virginia-Virginia state line near Glen Lyn, Virginia. Important points on the Deepwater Railway were Page, Mullens and Princeton in West Virginia.

In Virginia, another intrastate railroad, the Tidewater Railway, was formed in 1904, with right-of-way across the southern tier of Virginia from Giles County (which borders West Virginia) to Norfolk County on Hampton Roads. The principal points were Roanoke, Victoria, Suffolk, and Sewell&#x27;s Point, a rural location where a new coal pier was located on the harbor near Norfolk.

===Victoria is created===
Late in 1906, near the halfway point on the Tidewater Railway between Roanoke and Sewell&#x27;s Point, a new town with space set aside for railroad offices and shops was created in Lunenburg County, Virginia. It was named Victoria, in honor of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, who was admired by Henry Rogers.

Victoria was the location of a large equipment maintenance operation, with roundhouse, turntable, coaling and water facilities for servicing steam locomotives, and a large yard. Offices for the VGN&#x27;s Norfolk Division were built by adding a second floor to the passenger station building a few years later.

=== 1907: Virginian railway is born ===
The Virginian Railway Company was formed in Virginia on March 8, 1907, to combine the Deepwater Railway in West Virginia and the Tidewater Railway in Virginia into a single interstate railroad, only a few months after Victoria was incorporated. On April 15, 1907, William Nelson Page became the first president of the new Virginian Railway.

Work progressed on the VGN throughout 1907 and 1908 using construction techniques not available when the larger railroads had been built about 25 years earlier. By paying for work with Henry Rogers&#x27; personal fortune, the railway was built with no public debt. This feat, a key feature of the successful secrecy in securing the route, was not accomplished without some considerable burden to Rogers.
Rogers suffered some financial setbacks in the Financial Panic of 1907 which began in March. Then, a few months later that year, he experienced a debilitating stroke. He was largely disabled for five months. Rogers recovered his health, at least partially, and saw to it that construction was continued on the railroad until it was completed early in 1909.

===Last spike, celebrations===
The last spike in the Virginian Railway was driven on January 29, 1909, at the west side of the massive New River Bridge at Glen Lyn, near where the railroad crossed the West Virginia-Virginia state line.

In April 1909, Henry Huttleston Rogers and Mark Twain, old friends, returned to Norfolk, Virginia together once again for a huge celebration of the new &quot;Mountains to the Sea&quot; railroad&#x27;s completion.

Rogers departed the next day on his first (and only) tour of the new railroad. He died suddenly six weeks later at the age of 69 at his home in New York. By then, the work of the Page-Rogers partnership to build the Virginian Railway had been completed.

While neither William Page or Henry Rogers operated the railway, it was arguably a crowning achievement for each man. Together, they had conceived and built a modern, well-engineered railroad from the coal mines of West Virginia to tidewater at Hampton Roads. The Virginian Railway operated more efficiently than its larger competitors, had all-new infrastructure, and no debt. It was an accomplishment unparalleled in US railroading, before or since.

==Operating and Electrifying &quot;the Richest Little Railroad in the World&quot;==

Mr. Rogers left his heirs and employees with a marvelous new railroad which remained closely held until 1937; his son and sons-in-law such as Urban H. Broughton and William R. Coe were among its leaders. Coe served almost its entire history. Throughout that profitable 50-year history, the VGN continued to follow the Page-Rogers policy of &quot;paying up front for the best.&quot; It became particularly well known for treating its employees and vendors well, another investment that paid rich dividends. The VGN sought (and achieved) best efficiencies in the mountains, rolling piedmont and flat tidewater terrain. The profitable VGN experimented with the finest and largest steam, electric, and diesel locomotives. It was well known for operating the largest and best equipment, and could afford to. It became nicknamed &quot;the richest little railroad in the world.&quot;

The VGN had a very major grade at Clark&#x27;s Gap, West Virginia, and tried large steam locomotives before turning to an alternative already in use by one of its neighboring competitors, Norfolk &amp; Western Railway: a railway electrification system. With work authorized beginning in 1922, a 134-mile portion of the railroad in the mountains from Mullens, West Virginia over Clark&#x27;s Gap and several other major grades to Roanoke, Virginia was equipped with overhead wires supported by a catenary system at 11,000 volts. The VGN built its own power plant at Narrows, Virginia. The electrification was completed in 1925 at a cost of $15 million, equal to $ today. A link was established with Norfolk &amp; Western to share electricity from its nearby electrification during contingencies. ALCO and Westinghouse supplied the electric locomotives, which were equipped with pantographs. The 36 initial units were normally linked in groups of three as one set, and had much greater load capacity than the steam power they replaced. In 1948, four huge EL-2B twin-unit locomotives were purchased, followed by twelve EL-C rectifier locomotives in 1955.

The seemingly remotely located terminal Page and Rogers planned and built at Sewell&#x27;s Point played an important role in 20th-century U.S. naval history. Beginning in 1917 the former Jamestown Exposition grounds adjacent to the VGN coal pier was an important facility for the United States Navy. The VGN transported the high quality &quot;smokeless&quot; West Virginia bituminous coal favored by the US Navy for its ships, though all ships not built for fuel oil were converted to fuel oil well before WW II.

In the mid-1950s VGN management realized that the company&#x27;s devotion to coal as its energy source (for steam locomotives and the power plant at Narrows for the electrification system) was becoming overshadowed by the economies of diesel-electric locomotives and a scarcity of parts for the older steam locomotives. Between 1954 and 1957 a total of 66 diesel-electric locomotives were purchased, including 25 Fairbanks-Morse H-24-66 Train Masters, and 40 H-16-44 smaller road switchers, two with steam generators to haul passenger trains. The last steam locomotive operated in June, 1957.

At the end of 1925 VGN operated 545 route-miles on 902 miles of track; at the end of 1956 mileages were 611 and 1089.

== End of steam: decline at servicing points ==

Beginning in 1903 Page, West Virginia, named for Col. William Page, was the site of a switching yard, roundhouse, and station on the Deepwater Railway and later the Virginian Railway. After the railroad eliminated steam locomotives in 1957 and the area&#x27;s coal mines were largely depleted, the facilities at Page were unneeded. Mullens and Princeton in West Virginia, and Roanoke, Victoria and Sewell&#x27;s Point in Virginia were other locations where extensive steam locomotive servicing facilities and roundhouses were also no longer needed after 1957.

The passenger trains in the system&#x27;s final decade, the 1950s, consisted of separate runs from Page, West Virginia to Roanoke; and then between August, 1952 and July, 1955, from Roanoke to Norfolk. The last remaining passenger service on the line was discontinued by 1956. The latter route was on a more southerly and more rural itinerary than mainline of the Virginian&#x27;s major competitor, Norfolk and Western, whose main line went through Lynchburg and Petersburg.

==Merger with Norfolk &amp; Western==
During World War I, VGN was jointly operated with its adjacent competitor, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway (N&amp;W), under the USRA&#x27;s wartime takeover of the Pocahontas Roads. The operating efficiencies were significant. After the war, the railroads were returned to their respective owners and competitive status. However, N&amp;W never lost sight of VGN and its low-grade routing through Virginia.

After World War I there were many attempts by C&amp;O, N&amp;W, and others to acquire the Virginian Railway. However, the US Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) turned down attempts at combining the roads until the late 1950s, when a proposed Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and Virginian Railway merger was approved in 1959. Electric operation ended June 30, 1962.

==Legacy==
Two years after the merger, a book written by author and historian H. Reid, &quot;The Virginian Railway&quot;, was published. Reid stated that &quot;There will always be a Virginian.&quot;

Today, major portions of the VGN low-gradient route are the preferred eastbound coal path for N&amp;W&#x27;s successor Norfolk Southern Railway. Other portions of VGN right-of-way in eastern Virginia now transport fresh water and are under study for future high speed passenger rail service to South Hampton Roads from Richmond and Petersburg. The former VGN property at Sewell&#x27;s Point is part of the US Naval Station, Norfolk.

Although one of the smaller fallen flags of U.S. railroads, the Virginian Railway continues to have a loyal following of former employees, modelers, authors, photographers, historians and preservationists. Preservationists have saved VGN passenger stations in Suffolk and Roanoke, Virginia. The Suffolk Passenger Station, which was also used by the Seaboard railroads, has been restored and is in use as a museum. Similar plans are underway by the local chapter of the National Railway Historical Society in Roanoke for the Virginian Railway Passenger Station. The Oak Hill Railroad Depot in Oak Hill, West Virginia, the only remaining Virginian station in West Virginia, has also been restored by the local chapter of the National Railway Historical Society. In May 2003, the Virginian Railway Yard Historic District at Princeton was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Three of VGN&#x27;s locomotives and numerous cabooses and other rolling stock survive. One steam and one electric locomotive have been cosmetically restored, and are on display at the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia.

In October 2002 VGN authors and enthusiasts restored the Mullens, West Virginia Caboose Museum which had been ravaged in one of West Virginia&#x27;s notorious floods. The work was funded by sale of handmade models and contributions. In April 2004 children of Boonsboro Elementary School in nearby Bedford, Virginia and the local Kiwanis group in Lynchburg, Virginia teamed to raise funds and work to save the railroad&#x27;s only surviving original (circa 1910) class C-1 wooden caboose. In December 2004, a fully restored and equipped VGN caboose, C-10 No. 342, built by VGN employees in the former Princeton (WV) Shops, was moved to newly laid rails at Victoria, where it is the centerpiece of a new rail heritage park, dedicated in summer 2005.

In May 2003 a Gathering of Rail Friends was held at Victoria, Virginia, home to a museum, with a park with historical interpretations of the roundhouse and turntable sites under development. The Norfolk Southern Railway sent its exhibition train to nearby Crewe for the event.

In October 2004, the &quot;Roanoke Times&quot; ran a feature story about the weekly meetings of the &quot;Takin&#x27; Twenty with the Virginian Brethren&quot; group of retired VGN employees, prominently displaying the model of a modern GE locomotive in Virginian Railway livery, which they hope the railroad will use as a basis for a special painting of current-day Norfolk Southern Railway locomotive to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 1907 founding of their favorite railroad, the Virginian Railway.

In April 2005, the Virginian Railway Coalfield Seminar was held for three days at Twin Falls State Park, near Mullens, West Virginia. Railfriends from many parts of the United States toured coal mining and railroad facilities for three days on several buses, and participated in presentations and group seminars with a Congressman, local officials, several noted authors and historians. The delegation of retirees based in Roanoke also attended.

In early 2012, Norfolk Southern announced a program to paint selected units of new GE ES44AC and EMD SD70ACe orders into heritage paint schemes for predecessor roads. Virginian Railway was chosen among 19 other former railroads represented in the program. NS SD70ACe 1069 was painted to match the original yellow and black paint scheme worn by VGN&#x27;s Fairbanks-Morse diesels. As of June 2023, the engine is in Altoona, PA being repainted with fresh paint.

In 2015, a portion of the former Virginian in the state of West Virginia, was mothballed by Norfolk Southern due to a decline in coal shipments. In May 2016, WATCO Companies entered an agreement with Norfolk Southern to lease most of the remaining active line in West Virginia between Maben and Deepwater and operate it under the Kanawha River Railroad (KNWA) to load trains from Norfolk Southern at three mines on their system. The section between Maben and Mullens remains under Norfolk Southern control, with trackage rights for KNWA trains to interchange with NS at Elmore Yard.

<text>North Melbourne is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Melbourne local government area. North Melbourne recorded a population of 14,953 at the 2021 census.

North Melbourne is bounded by the CityLink freeway to the west, Victoria Street to the south, O&#x27;Connell and Peel Streets to the east and Flemington Road to the north. Since July 2008 its local government area has been the City of Melbourne, when it took over the administration of parts of Kensington and North Melbourne that were previously under the City of Moonee Valley, resulting in an increase of approximately 4760 residents and almost 3000 workers (2006 Census).

Formerly known as Hotham, it was essentially a working class area, with some middle class pockets, and was one of the first towns in Victoria to be granted Municipal status.

Today it continues to undergo gentrification, noted for its Victorian architecture, cosmopolitan demographic, commercial and older industrial areas.

==History==

North Melbourne&#x27;s first institutions were built in the 1840s, beginning with a cattle yard. At this time the area was not well defined and included Parkville and Royal Park, as well as a part of West Melbourne.

In the 1850s a Benevolent Asylum was built between Abbotsford and Curzon Streets, coinciding with the desire to find space to accommodate the growing population from the gold rush. (The Asylum remained a feature of the area until its move to Cheltenham in 1911.) In 1859 the area separated from the City of Melbourne and proclaimed as the municipal Borough of Hotham, after the Governor of Victoria Charles Hotham. Hotham Post Office opened on 20 March 1860.

By 1861, Hotham had a population of over 7,000.

In 1869, some of these decided to form the Hotham Football Club that later became a foundation member of the VFA (Australian rules football), today known as the North Melbourne Kangaroos. On 26 August 1887, the Borough was renamed North Melbourne. By this time it included an imposing North Melbourne Town Hall and the Metropolitan Meat Market, both designed by the architect George Raymond Johnson.

Although there were pockets of middle class housing in the wider tree-lined streets such as Dryburgh, Chapman and Brougham, by the 1880s the suburb had become a predominantly working class area with most of the male population employed in local industry.

In the 1890s tram routes had entered the area as far as Abbotsford Street, walking distance from the Arden Street Oval.

In 1905 North Melbourne was absorbed once again into the City of Melbourne.

In the 1930s many areas of North Melbourne, in particular the laneways, became overcrowded and defined as slums. As such, large government housing development projects were proposed, which were eventually completed in the 1960s.

The North Melbourne Court of Petty Sessions closed on 1 January 1968 and the former courthouse was sold to a private buyer in 1981.

==Commercial centre==

The main shopping strip of Errol Street is located largely between North Melbourne Town Hall and Victoria Street, with some further shops to the east, west and north of the intersection of Errol and Queensberry.

==Demographics==
North Melbourne&#x27;s real estate is above the Melbourne median and the suburb remains an overwhelmingly middle-class community. However, the median weekly household income was $1,236 at the , which was lower than the national median of $1,438.

The presence of recent migrants is evident, including many refugees from countries such as Somalia and Eritrea who often live around the government-owned housing estates near the Melrose Street area, on the suburb&#x27;s fringe. At the , 41.7% of residents reported being born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.7%; the next most common countries of birth were China 13.5%, Malaysia 2.9%, Vietnam 2.4%, England 2.3% and New Zealand 2.2%.

Residents of North Melbourne are significantly younger than most other areas of Australia; their median age was 28 years, whereas the national median age is 38. Children aged under 15 years made up 10.5% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up just 7.1% of the population.

===Religion===
The most common religious affiliation in North Melbourne was &quot;No Religion&quot; and accounted for 46.6% of responses at the 2016 census. Notable churches in North Melbourne include the Curzon Street Church (now known as St Mark the Evangelist), St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Church and the ornate Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral, built in 1963, on the high section of Dryburgh Street. The Catholic Church and Parish Primary School of St Michaels are also located in North Melbourne.

===Housing===

Historically, the predominant housing types were old Victorian-style terrace houses, warehouses, and some low-rise apartments. By the time of the , this had changed and 65.5% of private dwellings were flats, units or apartments. 27% were semi-detached (row or terrace houses, townhouses etc.), 6.2% were separate houses, and 0.4% were classified as &quot;other dwellings&quot;.

North Melbourne was slower to gentrify than other inner suburbs, due to established families resisting the sale of their homes for decades. A younger generation finally began to move in the 1980s, capitalising on the proximity to the Melbourne City Centre. Many of the old factories and warehouses were converted into fashionable loft-style apartments in 1990s. Since 2000, there has been a large increase in new medium density apartment complexes being built and house prices now exceed Melbourne&#x27;s median.

, the median house price was $882,500 at an annual growth of 7.25%. The median price of units was $487,500, having grown at 5.72%.

In the 12-month period to January 2020 North Melbourne reported a median house price of A$1.38 million for a three bedroom house.

==Culture==

&quot;Spring Fling&quot; is an annual festival for North and West Melbourne.

The heritage listed town hall and former Meat Market are both theatre and arts spaces.

===Sport===
The North Melbourne Football Club is still active and plays in the national Australian football competition, the Australian Football League. The club&#x27;s football department and training sessions are based at its traditional home ground at North Melbourne Cricket Ground, which has recently been redeveloped. Since 2019 both AFLW and VFL teams once again play there, bringing football back after a 34-year absence

==Transport==

Major roads include Flemington Road, Elizabeth Street and Victoria Street.

The suburb is served by two railway stations, and , both on the Upfield line. Despite the naming, the North Melbourne railway station is actually in the adjacent suburb of West Melbourne, while the Flemington Bridge railway station is within North Melbourne boundaries and not in Flemington. Arden railway station is planned to be built on Arden Street within North Melbourne&#x27;s industrial area, as part of the Melbourne Metro Rail Project.

North Melbourne is serviced by three tram routes:
* 57 – West Maribyrnong to Flinders Street station; travels down Flemington Road, and then Abbotsford, Queensberry, Errol, and Victoria Streets.
* 58 – West Coburg to Toorak; travels through Royal Park, and then down Flemington Road.
* 59 – Airport West to Flinders Street station; travels down Flemington Road.

It also has a number of bus routes.

<text>The Victorian Legislative Assembly is the state lower house of the bicameral Parliament of Victoria in Australia; the state upper house being the Victorian Legislative Council. Both houses sit at Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne. The main colour used for the upholstery and carpets furnishing the Chamber of the Legislative Assembly is green. 

The presiding officer of the Legislative Assembly is the Speaker. There are presently 88 members of the Legislative Assembly elected from single-member divisions.

==History==
Victoria was proclaimed a Colony on 1 July 1851 separating from the Colony of New South Wales by an act of the British Parliament. The Legislative Assembly was created on 13 March 1856 with the passing of the &quot;Victorian Electoral Bill&quot;, five years after the creation of the original unicameral Legislative Council. The Assembly first met on 21 November 1856, and consisted of sixty members representing thirty-seven multi and single-member electorates. On the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901, the Parliament of Victoria continued except that the colony was now called a state.

In 1917, the Nationalist government in Victoria introduced compulsory preferential voting before the 1917 state election. This enabled the factions in the party to field competing candidates without splitting the vote by keeping preferences within the party.

== Procedure ==
Most legislation is initiated in the Legislative Assembly. The party or coalition with a majority of seats in the lower house is invited by the Governor to form government. The leader of that party subsequently becomes Premier of Victoria, and their senior colleagues become ministers responsible for various portfolios. As Australian political parties traditionally vote along party lines, almost all legislation introduced by the governing party will pass through the legislative assembly.

===Committees===
Committees are formed of members from one house or both houses. Committees hold inquiries into particular issues and call for input from the wider community. 
* Privileges Committee
* Standing Orders Committee
* Economy and Infrastructure Committee
* Environment and Planning Committee
* Legal and Social Issues Committee

==Officials==
===Speaker===
At the beginning of each new parliamentary term, the Legislative Assembly elects one of its members as a presiding officer, known as the Speaker. The House may re-elect the incumbent speaker merely by passing a motion; otherwise, a secret ballot is held. In practice, the Speaker is usually a member of the governing party or parties, who have the majority in the House. The Speaker continues to be a member of their political party, but it is left to their individual discretion as to whether or not they attend party meetings. The Speaker also continues to carry out their ordinary electorate duties as a member of Parliament and must take part in an election campaign to be re-elected as a member of Parliament.

A Deputy Speaker is also elected by the Assembly, who supports and assists the Speaker in the execution of their duties.

===Non-member officials===
The Legislative Assembly is also supported by a department of civil servants who provide procedural and administrative advice on the running of the Assembly, and performs other functions. The head of the department is the Clerk of the Assembly, who is assisted by a deputy clerk, an assistant clerk committees and an assistant clerk procedure.

The Assembly is also assisted by a serjeant-at-arms, who at present also holds the position of assistant clerk procedure.

==Membership and elections==
The Legislative Assembly presently consists of 88 members, each elected in single-member electoral districts, more commonly known as electorates or seats. This is done using preferential voting, which is the same voting system used for the federal lower house, the Australian House of Representatives. Members represent approximately the same population in each electorate.

Since 2006, members of the Legislative Assembly are elected for a fixed term of 4 years, with elections occurring on the last Saturday of November every 4 years. There are no limits to the number of terms for which a member may seek election. Casual vacancies are filled at a by-election.

==Current distribution of seats==


* 44 votes as a majority are currently required to pass legislation.

==2022 election==

<doc id="571179" wikidata="Q1049218" url="?curid=571179" title="Southbank, Victoria">
<text>Southbank is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of the Melbourne central business district, located within the Cities of Melbourne and Port Phillip local government areas. Southbank recorded a population of 22,631 at the 2021 census.

Its southernmost area is considered part of the central business district of the city. Southbank is bordered to the north by the Yarra River, and to the east by St Kilda Road. Southbank&#x27;s southern and western borders are bounded by Dorcas Street, Kings Way, Market Street, Ferrars Street, and a triangle bordered by Gladstone Street, Montague Street and the West Gate Freeway.

Southbank was formerly a mostly industrial area, and simply part of the locality of South Melbourne, and the City of South Melbourne.

It was transformed into a densely populated district of high rise apartment and office buildings beginning in the early 1990s, as part of an urban renewal program. With the exceptions of the cultural precinct along St Kilda Road, few of the older industrial buildings were identified for retention.

Today, Southbank is dominated by high-rise development and is now the most densely populated areas of Melbourne, with a large cluster of apartment towers. It is home to many of Australia&#x27;s tallest buildings including the tallest measured to its highest floor, the Australia 108 and the former tallest Eureka Tower. It is one of the primary business centres in Greater Melbourne, being the headquarters of Treasury Wine Estates, Crown Resorts, Alumina, Incitec Pivot, The Herald and Weekly Times Pty Ltd, as well as regional offices of many major corporations, in a cluster of towers with over 340,000 square metres of office space in 2008.

Southbank Promenade and Southgate Restaurant and Shopping Precinct, on the southern bank of the Yarra River, extending to Crown Casino, is one of Melbourne&#x27;s major entertainment precincts. Southgate&#x27;s landmark &quot;Ophelia&quot; sculpture by Deborah Halpern has been used to represent Melbourne in tourism campaigns.

==History==

Before European settlement, the area now called South Melbourne was a series of low lying swamps inhabited by Aboriginal tribes. With the establishment of Melbourne in 1835 on the opposite bank of the river, the area remained undeveloped for some time, although shipping used berths along the river west of what is now the Queens Bridge. St Kilda Road, connecting to Princes Bridge, was developed as the major thoroughfare to the southern suburbs of Melbourne on the east side, and the track from the shipping piers of Port Melbourne to the city was formalised as City Road. After the Port Melbourne railway line was built across the area in 1854, the swamps were filled and the land, still much of which was in government hands, was developed as an industrial area. In 1888 the rail line was rebuilt, including the present Sandridge Bridge, and in 1890 Queensbridge was built creating another access to City Road, allowing cable tram access to Port Melbourne. By this time the riverside west of Queensbridge was lined with wharves and shipping sheds and maritime businesses including the Duke &amp; Orr drydock, now housing the Polly Woodside maritime museum (this small area including the Exhibition Centre was separated off as its own suburb South Wharf in 2008). Princes Bridge was rebuilt in 1888, allowing cable trams to reach the southern suburbs along St Kilda Road, and raising the road level at the river&#x27;s edge, with gardens established either side, the western one known as the Snowden Gardens.

A wide range of industries and warehousing occupied much of the area, mainly low scale shed-like light industrial buildings, but also heavy engineering works such as Austral Otis elevators on Kings Way (formerly Hannah Street), multi level store houses such as the Tea House on Clarendon Street, as well as the Castlemaine Brewery. By 1940 businesses included the Allen&#x27;s factory opposite Flinders Street station (with its famous animated neon sign), the Malvern Star bicycle works, and numerous car sales and maintenance businesses. By 1900 what is now the Victorian Arts Centre had become an entertainment precinct, with the Green Mill dance hall and circus site, and a large cinema and the Glacarium ice skating rink along City Road. In the 1920s the YMCA was built where City Road joined St Kilda Road, and in the 1960s two high rise office towers were built between City Road and Allen&#x27;s. Replacing the amusement area, the National Gallery of Victoria was opened in 1968, with the Arts Centre eventually opening in the early 1980s. In 1987 the elevated West Gate Freeway was extended to Kings Way, and by 1999 was extended to join the CityLink tunnels, carving a line across Southbank with a large area occupied by off ramps.

St Kilda Road was soon lined with a series of important institutions including the Police Barracks, Prince Henry&#x27;s Hospital and the Victoria Barracks. It also contained amusements such as a circus and dance halls where the Arts Centre is now.

In the 1980s the &quot;give the Yarra a go&#x27; campaign was intended to create public awareness of the possibilities of making the south bank of the river a more useful part of the city, rather than the city &#x27;turning its back&#x27; on the river. Planning toward this goal began under Planning Minister Evan Walker, and the first projects were the construction of a footbridge, the first such project in the city, now known as the Evan Walker Footbridge, designed by Cocks Carmichael Whitford, and the Southbank Promenade, designed by Denton Corker Marshall, opening in 1990. The two projects together won the RVIA Urban Design Award in 1991.

The Southgate development, which includes a shopping precinct, the Sheraton Towers hotel and new office buildings for the Herald &amp; Weekly Times and IBM were built soon after in stages between 1990 and 1993, and combined with a new Sunday arts and crafts market, attracted tourists to the area. Further buildings including the Esso headquarters were built between 1992 and 1995. In 1987 the Port Melbourne railway line was closed and converted to light rail, running up Clarendon Street and into the city, freeing up the land of the raised viaduct, and with the State Government combining surrounding land which it already owed, allowed the development along the Yarra River westward, with the Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre in 1996 and Crown Casino in 1997.

From the 1970s, the old Police Barracks had been home to the Victorian College of the Arts, and in the late 1980s an old Malthouse in City Road was converted into the Malthouse Theatre. Other institutions have joined since the 2000s to create the Melbourne Arts Precinct including award-winning buildings for the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art in 2002, the Southbank Theatre, Melbourne Recital Centre, and the Iwaki Auditorium at the ABC Centre

In the early 2000s, a new headquarters for the State Emergency Service was built in City Road.

Central Equity was a leader in the development of the area with apartment towers beginning in the mid-1990s, including Riverside Place, The Summit, Sentinel, Victoria Tower, Melbourne Tower and City Tower in the streets behind the waterfront. Central Equity apartments are aimed at both the owner occupier and rental market with management provided by Melbourne Inner City Management (MICM), a fully owned subsidiary of Central Equity. The 91 floor Eureka Tower was begun in 2002, aimed at being the tallest residential tower in the world and was completed in 2006. As part of the initial construction of Southgate, St Johns Lutheran Church relocated from the land that is now the site of the Herald &amp; Weekly Times building a few metres up City Road, to 20 City Road, and serves the Southbank community as a church and spiritual centre. The Church can be accessed either from City Rd or from the Southgate Shopping complex. The Queensbridge Precinct began development in 2005 with Freshwater Place. A plaza linked to the north bank and Flinders Street railway station via a pedestrian and cycle path developed on the Sandridge Bridge. Having been disused since the closure of the railway line in 1987, it was spared from demolition and was opened to the public on 12 March 2006, just in time for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. The Northbank promenade was completed later in 2006 linking other promenades on the north side of the river. 
An increasing number of corporations began opening their offices in Southbank. PwC relocated its office from Spring Street to Freshwater Place in 2005. JB Hi-Fi relocated its corporate headquarters from Chadstone Shopping Centre to Southgate in 2020, after its acquisition of The Good Guys. Other names on the list include Fujitsu, and Foster&#x27;s. In May 2008 the Victorian Government created the new suburb place and name South Wharf, in the western end of Southbank (now encompassing the Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre and the Polly Woodside National Trust museum). South Wharf is home to several large apartment buildings, along with a hotel and a large shopping centre precinct. Southbank and South Wharf share the same postcode (3006).


==Heritage==
Despite being dominated by modern apartments and office towers Southbank has a number of significant retained heritage buildings. Along St Kilda Road they include the 19th Century Victoria Barracks and the attached former Repatriation Commission Outpatient Clinic, the Victorian Arts Centre and National Gallery of Victoria, parts of the Victorian College of the Arts campus. Some individual heritage buildings in the wider Southbank precinct include the 1888 Jones Bond Store (25-43 Southbank Boulevard), the 1888 Tea House on Clarendon Street, the 1885 JH Boyd High School on City Road (now a community centre), and the former Castlemaine Brewery on Queensbridge Street.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census, there were 22,631 people in Southbank. 33.3% people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were India 9.4%, China (excludes SARs &amp; Taiwan) 8.9%, Colombia 3.9%, Malaysia 3.7% &amp; England 3%. 45.4% spoke only English at home. Language used at home, top responses other than English were, Mandarin 11.6%, Spanish 5.3%, Hindi 4%, Cantonese 3.1% &amp; Indonesian 2.1%. 

In the 2016 Census, the most common response for religion was No Religion at 41.9%.

==Media==

Southbank is home to the Melbourne headquarters of C31 Melbourne, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation including the studios for ABC Radio Melbourne, Radio National, ABC NewsRadio, ABC Classic FM, Triple J, ABV-2 and ABC Australia TV. The Herald and Weekly Times Tower (headquarters of the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper) is also located in Southbank. The suburb also has its own local newspaper the Southbank Local News, which circulates monthly.

==Promenade and footbridge==

The Southbank Promenade, completed in 1990, was designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall, and runs from Princes Bridge along to Queens Bridge Street and Queens Bridge. The Evan Walker Footbridge was also built at this time. The Yarra Promenade further to the west up to the Spencer Street Bridge was developed along with the Crown Entertainment Complex, completed in 1997, including Queensbridge Square, and running underneath the King Street Bridge.

The Southbank art and craft market occurs on the promenade near the Arts Centre every Sunday. The promenade is also home to several buskers and a pavement chalk artists.

==Transport==

Southbank has a network of major roads running through it and is often heavily congested with traffic and limited mainly to off-street multi-storey parking. The West Gate Freeway runs along the south border which has numerous interchanges to Southbank&#x27;s roads. The main north–south arterials leading into the Melbourne City Centre are Kingsway, Clarendon Street and Queensbridge/Moray Street. Secondary internal main roads include Southbank Boulevard, Sturt Street and Power Street. The main east–west arterials are City Road (east–west) and Normanby Road (which curves south into Whiteman Street). Many smaller roads allow one-way traffic only, to limit congestion.

Almost all southbound tramlines run along the St Kilda Road boundary, however the following tram lines run through Southbank:

* Route 1: Along Sturt Street
* Route 12: Along Clarendon Street
* Route 58: Along Queensbridge Street and Kings Way
* Route 96: Along Clarendon Street and Whiteman Street
* Route 109: Along Clarendon Street and Normanby Road

Although Southbank promenade forms part of the Capital City Bicycle Trail, the large number of pedestrians in the area means bicycle riding at high speed is hazardous; speed restrictions affecting cyclists are in place, with Victoria Police enforcing the speed limit.

<text>Vasily Kirillovich Trediakovsky (; – ) was a Russian poet, essayist and playwright who helped lay the foundations of classical Russian literature.

==Biography==
The son of a poor priest, Trediakovsky became the first Russian commoner to receive a humanistic education abroad, at the Sorbonne in Paris (1727–1730) where he studied philosophy, linguistics and mathematics. Soon after his return to Russia, he became acting secretary of the Academy of Sciences and &quot;de facto&quot; court poet.

In 1735, Trediakovsky published &quot;A New and Brief Way for Composing of Russian Verses&quot; (), a highly theoretical work for which he is best remembered. It discussed for the first time in Russian literature such poetic genres as the sonnet, the rondeau, the madrigal, and the ode.

In 1740, Trediakovsky received a physical beating at the hands of the imperial minister Artemy Volynsky. Volynsky was arrested on charges of conspiracy and misconduct, but Trediakovsky became, &quot;a subject of constant mockery&quot;, according to Elif Batuman: &quot;His very propensity for receiving physical abuse became a popular comic premise.&quot;

In 1748, his &quot;A Conversation on Orthography&quot; () appeared, which was the first study of the phonetic structure of the Russian language. He continued his advocacy of poetic reform in &quot;On Ancient, Middle, and New Russian Poetry&quot; () in 1752.

Trediakovsky was also a prolific translator of classical authors, medieval philosophers, and French literature. His translations frequently aroused the ire of the censors, and he fell into disfavour with his Academy superiors and conservative court circles. In 1759, he was dismissed from the Academy. His last major work was a translation of François Fénelon&#x27;s (1766; ), which he rendered in Russian hexameters. His works marked the transition from syllabic versification to metric verse, more suited to the sound of the Russian tongue.

<text>Russian orthography has been reformed officially and unofficially by changing the Russian alphabet over the course of the history of the Russian language. Several important reforms happened in the 18th–20th centuries.

==Early changes==
Old East Slavic adopted the Cyrillic script, approximately during the 10th century and at about the same time as the introduction of Eastern Christianity into the territories inhabited by the Eastern Slavs. No distinction was drawn between the vernacular language and the liturgical, though the latter was based on South Slavic rather than Eastern Slavic norms. As the language evolved, several letters, notably the &quot;yuses&quot; (Ѫ, Ѭ, Ѧ, Ѩ) were gradually and unsystematically discarded from both secular and church usage over the next centuries.

The emergence of the centralized Russian state in the 15th and 16th centuries, the consequent rise of the state bureaucracy along with the development of the common economic, political and cultural space necessitated the standardization of the language used in administrative and legal affairs. It was due to that reason that the earliest attempts at standardizing Russian, both in terms of the vocabulary and in terms of the orthography, were made initially based on the so-called Moscow chancery language. From then and on the underlying logic of language reforms in Russia reflected primarily the considerations of standardizing and streamlining language norms and rules in order to ensure the language&#x27;s role as a practical tool of communication and administration.

==18th-century changes==
The printed Russian alphabet began to assume its modern shape when Peter I introduced his &quot;civil script&quot; () type reform in 1708. The reform was not specifically orthographic in nature. However, with the replacement of Ѧ with and the effective elimination of several letters (Ѯ, Ѱ, Ѡ) and all diacritics and accents (with the exception of ) from secular usage and the use of Arabic numerals instead of Cyrillic numerals there appeared for the first time a visual distinction between Russian and Church Slavonic writing. With the strength of the historic tradition diminishing, Russian spelling in the 18th century became rather inconsistent, both in practice and in theory, as Mikhail Lomonosov advocated a morphophonemic orthography and Vasily Trediakovsky a phonemic one.

==19th-century changes==
Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, miscellaneous adjustments were made &quot;ad hoc&quot;, as the Russian literary language came to assume its modern and highly standardized form. These included the introduction of the letter &#x27; (yo) and the gradual loss of &#x27; (izhitsa, corresponding to the Greek &quot;upsilon&quot; υ and the Latin y), in favor of &#x27; or &#x27; (both of which represented ); and &#x27; (fita, corresponding to the Greek &quot;theta&quot; θ), in favor of &#x27; or &#x27;. (The standard Russian language neither has nor ever had a voiceless dental fricative. The &#x27; was used only for foreign words, particularly Greek.)

By 1917, the only two words still spelled with &#x27; in common use were (, , &#x27;chrism&#x27;) and (, , &#x27;synod&#x27;). The &#x27; remained more common, though it became quite rare as a &quot;Western&quot; (French-like) pronunciation had been adopted for many words; for example, (, , &#x27;theater&#x27;) became (, ).
Attempts to reduce spelling inconsistency culminated in the 1885 standard textbook of Yakov Karlovich Grot, which retained its authority through 21 editions until the Russian Revolution of 1917. His fusion of the morphological, phonetic, and historic principles of Russian orthography remains valid to this day, though both the Russian alphabet and the writing of many individual words have been altered through a complicated but extremely consistent system of spelling rules that tell which of two vowels to use under all conditions.
==Post-revolution reform==
The most recent major reform of Russian spelling was prepared by Aleksey Shakhmatov and implemented shortly after the Bolshevik revolution of November 1917.

Shakhmatov headed the Assembly for Considering Simplification of the Orthography whose proposals of 11 May 1917 formed the basis of the new rules soon adopted by the Ministry of Popular Education.

===Specific changes===

Russian orthography was made simpler and easier by unifying several adjectival and pronominal inflections, conflating the letter &#x27; (Yat) with &#x27;, &#x27; with &#x27;, and &#x27; and &#x27; with &#x27;. Additionally, the archaic mute &quot;yer&quot; became obsolete, including the &#x27; (the &quot;hard sign&quot;) in final position following consonants (thus eliminating practically the last graphical remnant of the Old Slavonic open-syllable system). For instance, became (&quot;Rybinsk&quot;).

Examples:
* to (children)
* to (Jesus Christ)
* to (marathon)
* to (Petrograd)
* to (region/district)
* to (Russia)
* to – The United States of America (, popular pre-revolutionary name of the United States in Russia)
* to (synod)

In a complex system of cases, the genitive adjectival ending was replaced with after &quot;ж, ц, ч, ш&quot;, and &quot;щ&quot; ( → ), in other instances was replaced with , with (e.g., → , → ).

19th-century spelling prescriptions distinguished feminine and neuter plural adjectival endings from masculine plural endings (with no difference in pronunciation). Although Old East Slavic distinction of genders in the plural (masculine feminine neuter ) had died in speech long ago, 18th-century writers still tried to distinguish genders in the spelling, and Mikhail Lomonosov&#x27;s variant was chosen as the standard. The reform gave the uniform , for all the three genders ( → ).

19th-century spelling prescriptions gave the spellings for feminine plural forms, but for masculine and neuter plural forms. Although these forms were prescribed to be pronounced differently, the difference was not usually observed in everyday speech; pronunciations were used interchangeably, the one with и being more common. The reform gave the uniform spelling for all genders. However, when were pronounced according to the spelling in poetic rhymes, modern editions write them as .

19th-century spelling prescriptions gave the spelling of the feminine pronoun in the genitive case, but in the accusative case, whereas it was usually pronounced as in both cases. The reform gave uniform spelling for both cases: (or , with the optional letter Ё). However, sometimes was pronounced according to the spelling in poetic rhymes. In that case, it is not changed in modern editions.

Prefixes ending with underwent a change: now all of them (except ) end with before voiceless consonants and with before voiced consonants or vowels (, but ). Previously, the prefixes showed concurrence between phonetic (as now) and morphological (always &quot;з&quot;) spellings; at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the standard rule was: &quot; &quot; were always written in this way; other prefixes ended with &quot;с&quot; before voiceless consonants except &quot;с&quot; and with &quot;з&quot; otherwise (, but ). Earlier 19th-century works also sometimes used &quot;з&quot; before &quot;ц, ч, ш, щ&quot;.

===Practical implementation===
In December 1917, the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education, headed by A. V. Lunacharsky, issued a decree stating, &quot;All state and government institutions and schools without exception should carry out the transition to the new orthography without delay. From 1 January 1918, all government and state publications, both periodical and non-periodical to be printed in the new style.&quot; The decree was nearly identical to the proposals put forth by the May Assembly, and with other minor modifications formed the substance of the decree issued by the Soviet of People&#x27;s Commissars in October 1918.

In this way, private publications could formally be printed using the old (or more generally, any convenient) orthography. The decree forbade the retraining of people previously trained under the old norm. A given spelling was considered incorrect only if it violated both the old and the new norms.
However, in practice, the Soviet government rapidly set up a monopoly on print production and kept a very close eye on the fulfillment of the edict. A common practice was the forced removal of not just the letters , , and from printing offices, but also . Because of this, the usage of the apostrophe as a dividing sign became widespread in place of (e.g., , instead of , ), and came to be perceived as a part of the reform (even if, from the point of view of the letter of the decree of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, such uses were mistakes). Nonetheless, some academic printings (connected with the publication of old works, documents or printings whose typesettings predated the revolution) came out in the old orthography (except title pages and, often, prefaces) up until 1929.

Russian – and later Soviet – railroads operated locomotives with designations of &quot;, &quot; and &quot;&quot;. (Although the letter Ѵ was not mentioned in the spelling reform, contrary to the statement in the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;, it had already become very rare prior to the revolution.) Despite the altered orthography, the series names remained unchanged up until these locomotives were discontinued in the 1950s.

Some Russian émigré publications continued to appear in the former orthography until the 1970s.

===Simplification===
The reform reduced the number of orthographic rules having no support in pronunciation—for example, the difference of the genders in the plural and the need to learn a long list of words which were written with yats (the composition of said list was controversial among linguists, and different spelling guides contradicted one another).

The reform resulted in some economy in writing and typesetting, due to the exclusion of at the end of words—by the reckoning of Lev Uspensky, text in the new orthography was shorter by one-thirtieth.

The reform removed pairs of completely homophonous graphemes from the Russian alphabet (i.e., and ; and ; and the trio of , and ), bringing the alphabet closer to the Russian language&#x27;s actual phonological system.

===Criticism===

According to critics, the choice of &quot;Ии&quot; as the only letter to represent that side and the removal of &quot;Іі&quot; defeated the purpose of &#x27;simplifying&#x27; the language, as &quot;Ии&quot; occupies more space and, furthermore, is sometimes indistinguishable from &quot;Шш&quot;.

The reform also created many homographs and homonyms, which used to be spelled differently. Examples: есть/ѣсть (is/to eat) and миръ/міръ (peace/world) became &quot;есть&quot; and &quot;мир&quot; in both instances.

Replacement of онѣ, однѣ, ея by они, одни, её was especially controversial, as these feminine pronouns were deeply rooted in the language and extensively used by writers and poets.

===Comparison===
The following is the same opening paragraph from &quot;The Bronze Horseman&quot; by Alexander Pushkin in its original version (left) and post-reform version (right):


== Mid-20th-century changes ==
While there have not been any significant changes since the 1918 decree, debates and fluctuations have to some degree continued.

In December 1942, the use of letter Ё was made mandatory by Decree No. 1825 of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education. Since then, Ё is taught in schools as the seventh letter of the Russian alphabet (before 1942, it was usually considered a modification of Е and not a separate letter). However, the consistent use of Ё did not consolidate its grip in general publication; the usual typographic practice reverted to selective use of Ё (to show pronunciation of rare words and to distinguish words that are otherwise homographs). By 1952, normatives on checking school works, the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot;, and the reference book for typographers by K. I. Bylinsky had declared the letter Ё to be optional.

A codification of the rules of Russian orthography and punctuation and the &quot;Spelling Dictionary of the Russian Language&quot; were published in 1956 but only a few minor orthographic changes were introduced at that time. Those editions gave end to a number of variant spellings that existed in dictionaries and in usage of typographers and best writers at that time. The 1956 codification additionally included a clarification of new rules for punctuation developed during the 1930s, and which had not been mentioned in the 1918 decree.

A notable instance of renewed debate followed A. I. Efimov&#x27;s 1962 publication of an article in &quot;Izvestia&quot;. The article proposed extensive reform to move closer to a phonetic representation of the language. Following the renewed discussion in papers and journals, a new Orthographic Commission began work in 1962, under the Russian Language Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. The Commission published its report, (Proposal for the Improvement of Russian Orthography), in 1964. The publication resulted in widespread debate in newspapers, journals, and on radio and television, as well as over 10,000 letters, all of which were passed to the institute.

Responses to the article pointed to the need to simplify Russian spelling due to the use of Russian as the language of international communication in the Soviet Union and an increased study of Russian in the Eastern Bloc as well as in the West. That instruction for non-native speakers of Russian was one of the central concerns of further reform is indicated in the resistance to Efimov&#x27;s proposal to drop the terminal &quot;ь&quot; (soft sign) from feminine nouns, as it helps learners identify gender category. Additionally, Efimov claimed that a disproportionate amount of primary school class time was devoted to orthography, rather than phonetics and morphology. Efimov asserted that the existing orthography was essentially unchanged since Grot&#x27;s codification, and that only by bringing orthography closer to phonetic realization, and eliminating exceptions and variants, could appropriate attention be paid to stylistics and the &quot;development of speech culture&quot;. The state&#x27;s focus on proper instruction in Russian, as the national language of ethnic Russians, as the state language, and as the language of international communication continues to the present day. Eventually, the 1964 project remained a dead proposal.

<text>The 4th Infantry Division was a regular infantry division of the British Army with a very long history, seeing active service in the Peninsular War and Waterloo Campaign, the Crimean and Boer Wars and both World Wars. It was disbanded after the Second World War and reformed in the 1950s as an armoured formation before being disbanded and reformed again and finally disbanded on 1 January 2012.

==Napoleonic Wars==
The 4th Division was originally formed in 1809 by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, as part of the Anglo-Portuguese Army, for service in the Peninsular War. It fought in the Battles of Talavera, Salamanca, Roncesvalles, Vitoria, the Pyrenees, Orthez, and Toulouse, and the siege of Badajoz.

===Peninsular War order of battle===
The order of battle from January 1812 was as follows:

Major General Sir Charles Colville (to April 1812)
Major General Lowry Cole (from June 1812)
* 1st Brigade: Major General James Kemmis
** 3/27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot
** 1/40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot
** 1/48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot (from October 1812)
** 2nd Provisional Battalion (2nd &amp; 1/53rd Regiments of Foot) (from December 1812)

===Waterloo===
At the Battle of Waterloo it was tasked with holding Wellington&#x27;s right flank and, with the exception of its 4th brigade, took no active part in the fighting, but did capture the town of Cambrai afterwards. The commanding general at this time was Charles Colville. In his novel &quot;Les Misérables&quot; Victor Hugo credits Colville with asking for the surrender of the Imperial Guard at Waterloo and receiving General Cambronne&#x27;s reply of &quot;Merde&quot;.

==Second Boer War==
The Army Corps sent from Britain on the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899 comprised three divisions (six brigades) while the troops already in South Africa were intended to constitute a 4th Division of three brigades. However, the troops intended to form the 7th and 8th Brigades became caught up in the Siege of Ladysmith. (The 9th Brigade fought at the Battle of Modder River under Lord Methuen and later joined his 1st Division.) It was only after the Relief of Ladysmith in March 1900 that the 4th Division under the command of Lieutenant-General the Hon Neville Lyttelton was formed from the garrison and joined the Natal Field Force. It was sometimes known as the &#x27;Ladysmith Division&#x27;.
===Order of Battle===
The division was constituted as follows:

7th Brigade
* Brigadier-General Walter Kitchener
* 1st Battalion, Devonshire Regiment
* 1st Battalion, Manchester Regiment
* 2nd Battalion, Gordon Highlanders
* 2nd Battalion, Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own)

8th Brigade
* Major-General Francis Howard
* 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s (Liverpool Regiment)
* 1st Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment
* 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers – &quot;not from the Ladysmith Garrison&quot;
* 1st Battalion, King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps

Divisional troops
* 2nd Brigade-Division, Royal Field Artillery 
** 21st, 42nd and 53rd Batteries
* 2 x Naval 12-pounder guns
* 23rd Company, Royal Engineers

===Service===
The troops of 4th Division were still sickly after the Siege of Ladysmith, and it played little part in Sir Redvers Buller&#x27;s operations to clear the Boers out of Natal in May and June. It was then left to defend Natal when Buller advanced into Transvaal in July. The division was not complete until 5 August when Walter Kitchener&#x27;s 7th Brigade caught up. It marched out next day with Buller towards Balmoral to link up with Lord Roberts&#x27;s Army. The division fought an engagement with the Boers on the way to Amersfoort on 7 August, then carried out a 10-day march via Ermelo, skirmishing every day, with the opposition increasing as the column advanced. On 22 August Walter Kitchener was detached with part of his brigade to clear some troublesome Kopjes on the flank, and next day section of 21st Battery, RFA, was heavily engaged with Boer guns. The division joined up with Roberts on 27 August, when 7th Brigade assaulted an entrenched position on the Berg-en-dal kopje.

The Battle of Bergendal was the last set-piece action of the war, but was followed by a long period of Guerrilla warfare. British forces were increasingly dispersed into &quot;ad hoc&quot; columns pursuing small Boer forces. Lyttelton&#x27;s division was reduced to five-and-a-half battalions and a Mounted infantry detachment for Buller&#x27;s advance to Lydenburg in September. On 5 September 7 Brigade&#x27;s camp came under long range artillery fire, but Howard and the artillery cleared the Boers away. The column entered Lydenburg on 7 September, then attacked Paardeplaats next day, when Lyttelton with his four remaining battalions attacked the Boer right. Buller&#x27;s column then marched into the rugged country of North East Transvaal through the &#x27;Devil&#x27;s Knuckles&#x27; and &#x27;Hell&#x27;s Gate&#x27; before returning to Lydenburg on 2 October, capturing a large Boer supply column on the way.

Roberts and Buller returned to the UK In early October and Lyttelton took over command of Buller&#x27;s forces scattered in small garrisons guarding the Natal–Delagoa Bay Railway. The brigade and divisional organisation was abandoned for the rest of the war.

==First World War==
As a permanently established Regular Army division it was amongst the first to be sent to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of the First World War. It served on the Western Front for the duration of the war and was present during all the major offensives including the Battle of the Marne, Battle of Ypres, Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Passchendaele.

==Second World War==
===France and Belgium===

Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 the 4th Division, under Major General Dudley Johnson, who had won the Victoria Cross (VC) in the Great War, was sent to the border between France and Belgium as part of Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke&#x27;s II Corps of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). All three of the division&#x27;s brigades were commanded by distinguished soldiers, the 10th by Brigadier Evelyn Barker, the 11th by Brigadier Kenneth Anderson and the 12th by Brigadier John Hawkesworth. After the disastrous Battle of France in May–June 1940, where the division sustained heavy losses, and the evacuation at Dunkirk, it spent the next two years in the United Kingdom on anti-invasion duties and training for its next deployment.

In June 1942 the division, now under Major General John Hawkesworth, was selected to be converted into a &#x27;mixed&#x27; division, consisting of two infantry brigades and one tank brigade. As a result of this change, the divisions&#x27; 11th Infantry Brigade left the division and was replaced by the 21st Army Tank Brigade.

===North Africa===
The division departed for North Africa in early 1943, arriving in Tunisia in March, coming under Lieutenant-General John Crocker&#x27;s IX Corps, part of the British First Army. During the Tunisian Campaign it was involved in Operation Vulcan, the final ground attack against Axis forces in North Africa which ended the North African Campaign, with the surrender of nearly 250,000 German and Italian soldiers. During the assault the division suffered heavy losses, with four battalions sustaining over 300 casualties. After the Axis defeat in North Africa, in May 1943, the division was to remain there for the next 9 months, during which time it was converted back into a standard infantry division, with the 28th Infantry Brigade, consisting mainly of Regular Army battalions who had served on garrison duties in Gibraltar, arriving to replace the 21st Tank Brigade.

===Italy===
The division arrived on the Italian Front in late February 1944, relieving the British 46th Infantry Division, initially coming under command of Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery&#x27;s British X Corps, then serving under the U.S. Fifth Army. In March the division transferred to Lieutenant-General Sidney Kirkman&#x27;s British XIII Corps, part of the British Eighth Army. The division, now under the command of Major-General Alfred Dudley Ward, fought with distinction at the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino in May 1944, and later in severe fighting in the battles for the Gothic Line. During the battle of Cassino Captain Richard Wakeford of the 2/4th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment was awarded the Victoria Cross.

===Greece===
However, in November 1944 it was dispatched, with the rest of III Corps, to Greece to provide assistance during the Greek Civil War, and was to remain there until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.

==Post War and Cold War==
The 4th Infantry Division remained in Greece, during the Greek Civil War. During its time in Greece, the division was deployed to Attica. In February 1946, it moved to the northern part of the country after the 4th Indian Division returned to India. It was relieved by the 13th Infantry Division in Attica. The following month, it was disbanded while still in Greece.

In Germany, on 1 April 1956, the 4th Infantry Division was reformed at Herford following the conversion and redesignation of the 11th Armoured Division (the latter division&#x27;s 91st Lorried Infantry Brigade was reorganised as the 12th Infantry Brigade in the process of joining the 4th Infantry Division). The newly formed division, now part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), was also allocated the lorried infantry brigades of the 6th and the 7th Armoured Divisions. Two years later, following the disbanding of different BAOR formations and further restructuring, the division comprised the 4th (Guards), the 5th Infantry, and the 20th Armoured Brigades. Around this time period, the term &quot;infantry&quot; was dropped from the division&#x27;s title so that it was known simply as the 4th Division. During February 1963, the division undertook Exercise Iron Bar, which trialed merging the divisional headquarters with the divisional signal regiment. It proved successful and became permanent in 1965, followed by Exercise Open Glove to further test the arrangement. By the 1970s, the division consisted of the 6th and 20th Armoured Brigades.

==Armoured division==
The 1975 Mason Review, a government white paper, outlined a new defence policy that restructured the BAOR. As a result, on 1 January 1978, the 4th Division was renamed the 4th Armoured Division. It then restructured to consist of two armoured regiments, three mechanised infantry battalions, and two artillery regiments, as the Mason Review had removed brigades and replaced them with a concept of task forces or battlegroups. It was intended that the division could form up to five battlegroups, with each commanded by either an armoured regiment or an infantry battalion. These groups were to be formed for a specific task and allocated the required forces needed. The divisional commander (general officer commanding (GOC)) would oversee these battlegroups, but early training showed this to be impractical. To compensate, the divisional headquarters was increased to 750 men (wartime strength) and included two brigadiers. Each officer would command a flexible task force, which consisted of the battlegroups the GOC had formed. The division&#x27;s task forces were named Task Force Golf and Task Force Hotel. These were not a reintroduction of a brigade command structure and had no administrative responsibilities. The approach intended to provide greater flexibility in tailoring forces to meet unforeseen events and allow for an overall reduction in the size of a division by 700 men. The task force concept was dropped by the end of the decade, having been deemed to have not met expectations. With the reintroduction of brigades, the division consisted of the 11th Armoured Brigade (based at Minden) that comprised one armoured regiment and two mechanised infantry battalions, and the 20th Armoured Brigade (located in Detmold) that consisted of two armoured regiments and one mechanised infantry battalion.

By 1983, the division had been assigned the 19th Infantry Brigade, which was located in Colchester, England. This brigade was subsequently switched with the 3rd Armoured Division&#x27;s 33rd Armoured Brigade (based at Paderborn), to bring the 4th Armoured Division up to a strength of three armoured brigades and with all its troops located in Germany. The end of the 1980s saw the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. In July 1990, the British government announced Options for Change. This framework sought to restructure the British military based on the new strategic situation, allow for further cost saving measures to be enacted, and to reduce the BAOR by half. In July 1993, this resulted in the division being redesignated and becoming the 1st (UK) Armoured Division, and the 4th Armoured Division ceased to exist.

==Final decades==
During the mid-1990s, the British Army further restructured. Various regional districts were replaced by several regionally based divisions, which included the reformed 4th Division. Alongside the 2nd and the 5th Divisions, the 4th was dubbed a &quot;regenerative&quot; formation; holding administrative and training responsibilities for all non-deployed forces located within its geographical boundaries (the south east and parts of eastern England, excluding the Greater London area). In the event of a major international crisis, the formation would be used as the core to form a combat-ready division around. On reformation (1 April 1995), the division was headquartered at Aldershot and adopted a tiger as its insignia. It comprised the 2nd Brigade (headquartered at Shorncliffe Army Camp), the 24th Airmobile Brigade (Colchester), and the 145th Infantry Brigade (Aldershot). At the time, it was between 13,400–14,400 strong and the largest British formation based in the UK. It also contained 26 Challenger I tanks, 154 artillery pieces, in addition to other weapon systems and vehicles.

The 1998 Strategic Defence Review resulted in several changes. The 24th (Airmobile) Brigade was merged with the 5th (Airborne) Brigade to form the 16 Air Assault Brigade in 1999. While this brigade was administered by the division, its operational command was held by Land Command. On 1 April 2000, the boundaries of the division were expanded so that it then over oversaw London District (for budgetary purposes) and it took command of the 49th (Eastern) Brigade. During 2007, the division&#x27;s boundaries were again changed, resulting in the loss of Colchester Garrison (as well as administering the 16th Air Assault Brigade based there) and the 49th (Eastern) Brigade. In return the formation&#x27;s region was expanded west, so that it gained the 43rd (Wessex) Brigade. The 145th Infantry Brigade was renamed the 145th (South) Brigade, and the division was given administrative control over the Brunei garrison and the British Gurkhas Nepal organisation.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010 identified that the army had had become optimised for operations in Afghanistan, but in order to meet potential future threats would need to be reorgnised to become more flexible. This restructure was called Army 2020 and resulted in the decision to disband the three regional regenerative divisions, to be replaced by Support Command, with the aim of making the home-based forces better able to support any deployed troops. During January 2012, the 4th Division was disbanded (followed by the 2nd and the 5th Divisions in April).

<doc id="571191" wikidata="Q462760" url="?curid=571191" title="Watcher in the Water">
<text>The Watcher in the Water is a fictional creature in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth; it appears in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the first volume of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Lurking in a lake beneath the western walls of the dwarf-realm Moria, it is said to have appeared after the damming of the river Sirannon, and its presence was first recorded by Balin&#x27;s dwarf company 30 or so years before the beginning of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. 

The origins of the creature are not described in Tolkien&#x27;s works, but critics have compared it to the legendary kraken and to Odysseus&#x27;s passage between the devouring Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis. Its presence in combination with the barrier lake and the formidable Doors of Durin have been likened to the multiple obstacles often found in Norse mythology.

== Literature ==

In &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Fellowship of the Ring are on a quest to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron. During their journey, they face two evil choices to cross the Misty Mountains: over the mountain of Caradhras through the Redhorn Gate pass, or through Moria, a dark labyrinth of tunnels and pits. They first try the mountain pass, but the weather proves too severe, and the Fellowship turn back and approach Moria&#x27;s West Gate, beside which the Watcher lived in a lake. 
It is said to have appeared after the damming of the local river Sirannon, and its presence was first recorded by Balin&#x27;s dwarf company 30 or so years before the beginning of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. When the party approaches the Gate, the Watcher seizes Frodo Baggins with a long, pale-green, luminous, fingered tentacle, succeeded by twenty more. The Company rescue Frodo and retreat into Moria, and the Watcher seals the Doors of the West Gate shut. As Gandalf commented, &quot;Something has crept or been driven out of the dark water under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than orcs in the deep places of the world.&quot; He privately notes that the creature reached for Frodo, the Ring-bearer, first out of all the members of the company. 

Later, the Fellowship find the Book of Mazarbul, a record of Balin&#x27;s failed expedition of Dwarves to reclaim Moria. In the last pages of the book, the scribe, revealed to be Ori, relates: &quot;We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They [the Orcs] have taken the Bridge and second hall. ... the pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin. We cannot get out. The end comes ... drums, drums in the deep ... they are coming.&quot;

== Concept and creation ==

The &quot;Watcher in the Water&quot;, or just &quot;the Watcher&quot;, is the only name Tolkien gave to this creature.

An early version of the Fellowship&#x27;s encounter with the Watcher is found in &quot;The Return of the Shadow&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s account of the creature at this stage is practically the same as in the final published version. Its emergence, physical appearance, abilities, attack on the Fellowship, and the breaking of the Moria Gate are already present in his initial writings.

== Analysis ==

In &quot;The Complete Tolkien Companion&quot;, J. E. A. Tyler suggests that the Watcher was a cold-drake: &quot;these dragons rely on their strength and speed alone (the creature that attacked the Ring-bearer near the Lake of Moria may have been one of these)&quot;. 

The essayist Allison Harl writes that the Watcher may be a kraken created and bred by Morgoth in Utumno, and that it represents a gatekeeper whose goal, in the context of the archetypal journey, is to keep the heroes from entering into new territory, psychologically or spiritually. This &quot;guardian theory&quot; has been echoed by writers such as Joseph Campbell.

The scholar of English literature Charles A. Huttar suggests possible origins for the Watcher in the Classical world. He compares the combination of the tentacled monster and the &quot;clashing gate&quot; when the Fellowship pass through the Doors of Durin, only to have the Watcher smash the rocks behind them, to Greek mythology&#x27;s Wandering Rocks near the opening of the underworld, and to Odysseus&#x27;s passage between the devouring Scylla and the whirlpool Charybdis.

The scholar Jonathan Evans describes the monster as &quot;the vague Watcher in the Water&quot; and &quot;a many-tentacled creature&quot;. He notes Gandalf&#x27;s description, and compares this with Gandalf&#x27;s later statement that &quot;the world is gnawed by nameless things&quot; in Moria&#x27;s deepest places, older even than Sauron &quot;and unknown even to him&quot;.

Marjorie Burns, a scholar of English literature, situates the Watcher in the Water as part of a triple obstacle to entering Moria: &quot;ominous obstructing waters, the Watcher within, and highly resistant doors&quot;. She comments that such a &quot;piling up of opposition&quot; is characteristic of Norse mythology, in which it is common for there to be massive obstacles, unwelcoming gates, aggressive dogs and &quot;persistent guardians&quot;.

Norbert Schürer writes in &quot;Mythlore&quot; that Tolkien effectively describes the state of the water, the nature of the Watcher, and the situation of the Company of the Ring on their dangerous quest all at once, the aquatic environment &quot;symbolically represent[ing]&quot; the difficulty of the choice to be made.

== Adaptations ==

The Watcher in the Water appears in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001). In Jackson&#x27;s adaptation, the Watcher is portrayed as a colossal, octopus-like monster. Jackson stated in the commentaries that the original idea was to have the Watcher drag Bill the pony, who was carrying the party&#x27;s baggage, underwater. In the concept art gallery feature on the DVD, the artists John Howe and Alan Lee explain that the Watcher was one of the most difficult creatures to design as Tolkien had written so little about it.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game&quot; by Games Workshop, based on Jackson&#x27;s film, calls the Watcher in the Water the &quot;Guardian of the Doors of Durin&quot;.

<text>Blockley is a village, civil parish and ecclesiastical parish in the Cotswold district of Gloucestershire, England, about northwest of Moreton-in-Marsh. Until 1931 Blockley was an exclave of Worcestershire.

The civil and ecclesiastical parish boundaries are roughly coterminous, and include the hamlets of Draycott, Paxford and Aston Magna, the residential development at Northwick and the deserted hamlets of Upton and Upper Ditchford.

Blockley village is on Blockley Brook, a tributary of Knee Brook. Knee Brook forms the northeastern boundary of the parish and is a tributary of the River Stour.

==History==
===Manor===
In AD 855 King Burgred of Mercia granted a monastery at Blockley to Ealhhun, Bishop of Worcester for the price of 300 solidi. In 1086 the Domesday Book recorded that the Bishop of Worcester held an estate of 38 hides at Blockley. The Bishops of Worcester retained the estate until 1648, during the English Civil War, when the Parliamentary Trustees sold it. After the restoration of the English monarchy the estate was restored to the Bishop of Worcester, whose successors held the manor until at least 1781.

===Churches===

The Church of England parish church of St. Peter and St. Paul is late Norman, built in about 1180. The ecclesiastical parish now forms part of the Vale and Cotswold Edge team of Church of England churches, with the Team Vicar remaining responsible for Blockley and its outlying villages of Paxford, Draycott and Aston Magna, as well as the parish of Bourton-on-the-Hill.

The church is used as St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in the &quot;Father Brown&quot; television series and the vicarage as the presbytery, Father Brown&#x27;s residence.

The Baptist Chapel was built in 1835.

===Economic and social history===
In 1715 the Vicar, the Rev. Dr. Erasmus Saunders, had a new school built for the parish. Blockley still has a Church of England primary school.

Much of the parish was farmed under an open field system until 1772, when an Act of Parliament provided for the enclosure of the remaining common lands.

The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway, built between 1845 and 1851, passes through the parish. Blockley railway station was more than northeast of the village and nearer to Paxford. British Railways closed Blockley railway station in 1966 but the railway remains open as part of the Cotswold Line. The nearest railway station still open is .

Blockley is home to Watsonian Squire, the largest UK manufacturer of sidecars and trailers for motorbikes. It has been based in the village since 1984.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward has the same area and population as the civil parish.

==Amenities==

Blockley has two public houses. The Crown Inn and Hotel is a former coaching inn. The Great Western Arms belongs to the Hook Norton Brewery.

Blockley Sports &amp; Social Club is the local sports club which has Hockey, Cricket and Football sections. The post office closed in 2007. In May 2008, under a co-operative agreement, the village residents opened a new local not for profit store that is a grocer, newsagent, post office, off-licence and café.

<doc id="571196" wikidata="Q398300" url="?curid=571196" title="Ophiocordyceps sinensis">
<text>Ophiocordyceps sinensis (synonym Cordyceps sinensis), known colloquially as caterpillar fungus, is an entomopathogenic fungus (a fungus that grows on insects) in the family Ophiocordycipitaceae. It is mainly found in the meadows above on the Tibetan Plateau in Tibet and the Himalayan regions of Bhutan, India, and Nepal. It parasitizes larvae of ghost moths and produces a fruiting body which is valued in traditional Chinese medicine as an aphrodisiac. Caterpillar fungus contains the compound cordycepin, an adenosine derivative. However, naturally harvested fruiting bodies often contain high amounts of arsenic and other heavy metals, making them potentially toxic. As a result, their sale has been strictly regulated by China&#x27;s State Administration for Market Regulation since 2016.

&quot;O. sinensis&quot; parasitizes the larvae of moths within the family Hepialidae, specifically genera found on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas, between elevations of . The fungus germinates in the living larva, kills and mummifies it, and then a dark brown stalk-like fruiting body which is a few centimeters long emerges from the corpse and stands upright.

&quot;O. sinensis&quot; is classified as a medicinal mushroom, and its use has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine as well as in traditional Tibetan medicine. The hand-collected, intact fungus-caterpillar body is valued by herbalists as medicine, and because of its cost, its use is also a status symbol.

The fruiting bodies of the fungus are not yet cultivated commercially, but the mycelium form can be cultivated in vitro. Overharvesting and overexploitation have led to the classification of &quot;O. sinensis&quot; as an endangered species in China. Additional research needs to be carried out in order to understand its morphology and growth habits for conservation and optimum utilization.

==Taxonomic history and systematics==
===Morphological features===
&quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; consists of two parts, a fungal endosclerotium (within the caterpillar) and stroma. The stroma is the upper fungal part and is dark brown or black, but can be a yellow color when fresh, and longer than the caterpillar itself, usually 4–10 cm. It grows singly from the larval head, and is clavate, sublanceolate or fusiform, and distinct from the stipe (stalk). The stipe is slender, glabrous, and longitudinally furrowed or ridged.

The fertile part of the stroma is the head. The head is granular because of the ostioles of the embedded perithecia. The perithecia are ordinally arranged and ovoid. The asci are cylindrical or slightly tapering at both ends, and may be straight or curved, with a capitate and hemispheroid apex, and may be two to four spored. Similarly, ascospores are hyaline, filiform, multiseptate at a length of 5–12 μm and subattenuated on both sides. Perithecial, ascus and ascospore characters in the fruiting bodies are the key identification characteristics of &quot;O. sinensis&quot;.

&quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; (Petch) Kobayasi species produce whole ascospores and do not separate into part spores. This is different from other &quot;Cordyceps&quot; species, which produce either immersed or superficial perithecia perpendicular to stromal surface, and the ascospores at maturity are disarticulated into part spores. Generally &quot;Cordyceps&quot; species possess brightly colored and fleshy stromata, but &quot;O. sinensis&quot; has dark pigments and tough to pliant stromata, a typical characteristic feature of most of the &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; species.

===Developments in classification===
The species was first described scientifically by Miles Berkeley in 1843 as &quot;Sphaeria sinensis&quot;; Pier Andrea Saccardo transferred the species to the genus &quot;Cordyceps&quot; in 1878. The fungus was known as &quot;Cordyceps sinensis&quot; until 2007, when molecular analysis was used to amend the classification of the Cordycipitaceae and the Clavicipitaceae, resulting in the naming of a new family Ophiocordycipitaceae and the transfer of several &quot;Cordyceps&quot; species including &quot;C. sinensis&quot; to the genus &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot;.

===Common names===
In Tibet, it is known as yartsa gunbu, (, &quot;summer grass winter worm&quot;). The name was first recorded in the 15th century by the Tibetan doctor Zurkhar Namnyi Dorje. In colloquial Tibetan yartsa gunbu is often shortened to simply &quot;bu&quot; or &quot;yartsa&quot;. The Tibetan name is transliterated in Nepali as यार्चागुन्बू, यार्चागुन्बा, yarshagumba, yarchagumba or yarsagumba. The transliteration in Bhutan is .

In India, it is known as keera jhar, keeda jadi, keeda ghas or in Nepali, Hindi and Garhwali.

It is known in Chinese as &#x27; (冬蟲夏草), meaning &quot;winter worm, summer grass&quot;, which is a literal translation of the original Tibetan name. In traditional Chinese medicine, its name is often abbreviated as chong cao (蟲草 &quot;insect plant&quot;), a name that also applies to other &quot;Cordyceps&quot; species, such as &quot;C. militaris&quot;. In Japanese, it is known by the Japanese reading of the characters for the Chinese name, . Strangely, sometimes in Chinese English-language texts &quot;Cordyceps sinensis&quot; is referred to as aweto&quot;&quot;&#x27;, which is the Māori name for &quot;Ophiocordyceps robertsii&quot;, a species from south-eastern Australia and New Zealand.

The English term &quot;vegetable caterpillar&quot; is a misnomer, as no plant is involved. &quot;Caterpillar fungus&quot; is a preferred term.

===Nomenclature of the anamorph===
Since the 1980s, 22 species in 13 genera have been attributed to the anamorph (asexually reproducing mold-like form) of &quot;O. sinensis&quot;. Of the 22 species, &quot;Cephalosporium acreomonium&quot; is the zygomycetous species of &quot;Umbelopsis&quot;, &quot;Chrysosporium sinense&quot; has very low similarity in RAPD polymorphism, hence it is not the anamorph. Likewise, &quot;Cephalosporium dongchongxiacae&quot;, &quot;C. sp.&quot; &quot;sensu&quot;, &quot;Hirsutella sinensis&quot; and &quot;H. hepiali&quot; and &quot;Synnematium sinnense&quot; are synonymous and only &quot;H. sinensis&quot; is only validly published in articles. &quot;Cephalosporium sinensis&quot; possibly might be synonymous to &quot;H. sinensis&quot; but there is lack of valid information. &quot;Isaria farinosa&quot; is combined to &quot;Paecilomyces farinosus&quot; and is not the anamorph. Several isolates of &quot;Isaria sp., Verticella sp., Scydalium sp.&quot; and &quot;Stachybotrys sp.&quot; were identified only up to generic level, and it is dubious that they are anamorph. &quot;Mortierella hepiali&quot; is discarded as anamorph as it belongs to Zygomycota. &quot;Paecilomyces sinensis&quot; and &quot;Sporothrix insectorum&quot; are discarded based on the molecular evidence. &quot;P. lingi&quot; appeared only in one article and thus is discarded because of incomplete information. &quot;Tolypocladium sinense, P. hepiali&quot;, and &quot;Scydalium hepiali&quot;, have no valid information and thus are not considered as anamorph to &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis. V. sinensis&quot; is not considered anamorph as there is no valid published information. Similarly, &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot; is not considered anamorph as it has widely distributed host range, and is not restricted only in high altitude.

Thus &quot;Hirsutella sinensis&quot; is considered the validly published anamorph of &quot;O. sinensis, Cordyceps nepalensis&quot; and &quot;C. multiaxialis&quot; which had similar morphological characteristics to &quot;O. sinensis&quot;, also had almost identical or identical ITS sequences and its presumed anamorph, &quot;H. sinensis&quot;. This also confirms &quot;H. sinensis&quot; to be anamorph of &quot;O. sinensis&quot; and suggests &quot;C. nepalensis&quot; and &quot;C. multiaxialis&quot; are synonyms. Evidence based on microcyclic conidiation from ascospores and molecular studies support &quot;H. sinensis&quot; as the anamorph of the caterpillar fungus, &quot;O. sinensis&quot;.

==Ecology and life cycle==

The caterpillars prone to infection by &quot;O. sinensis&quot; generally live underground in alpine grass and shrub-lands on the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas at an altitude between . The fungus is reported from the northern range of Nepal, Bhutan, and also from the northern states of India, apart from northern Yunnan, eastern Qinghai, eastern Tibet, western Sichuan, southwestern Gansu provinces. Fifty-seven taxa from several genera (37 &quot;Thitarodes&quot;, 1 &quot;Bipectilus&quot;, 1 &quot;Endoclita&quot;, 1 &quot;Gazoryctra&quot;, 3 &quot;Pharmacis&quot;, and 14 others not correctly identified to genus) are recognized as potential hosts of &quot;O. sinensis&quot;.

The stalk-like dark brown to black fruiting body (or mushroom) grows out of the head of the dead caterpillar and emerges from the soil in alpine meadows by early spring. During late summer, the fruiting body disperses spores. The caterpillars, which live underground feeding on roots, are most vulnerable to the fungus after shedding their skin, during late summer. In late autumn, chemicals on the skin of the caterpillar interact with the fungal spores and release the fungal mycelia, which then infects the caterpillar.

The infected larvae tend to remain underground vertical to the soil surface with their heads up. After invading a host larva, the fungus ramifies throughout the host and eventually kills it. Gradually the host larvae become rigid because of the production of fungal sclerotia. Fungal sclerotia are multihyphal structures that can remain dormant and then germinate to produce spores. After overwintering, the fungus ruptures the host body, forming the fruiting body, a sexual sporulating structure (a perithecial stroma) from the larval head that is connected to the sclerotia in the dead larva below ground and grows upward to emerge from the soil to complete the cycle.

The slow growing &quot;O. sinensis&quot; grows at a comparatively low temperature, i.e., below 21 °C. Temperature requirements and growth rates are crucial factors that distinguish &quot;O. sinensis&quot; from other similar fungi. Climate change is suspected to be negatively affecting the mountain organism.

== Use in traditional Asian medicines ==

The use of caterpillar fungus as folk medicine apparently originated in Tibet and Nepal. So far the oldest known text documenting its use was written in the late 15th century by the Tibetan doctor Zurkhar Nyamnyi Dorje (Wylie: ) [1439–1475]) in his text: (&quot;Instructions on a Myriad of Medicines&quot;), where he describes its use as an aphrodisiac.

The first mention of &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; in traditional Chinese medicine was in Wang Ang’s 1694 compendium of materia medica, &quot;Ben Cao Bei Yao&quot;. In the 18th century it was listed in Wu Yiluo&#x27;s &quot;Ben cao cong xin&quot; (&quot;New compilation of materia medica&quot;). The ethno-mycological knowledge on caterpillar fungus among the Nepalese people is documented. The entire fungus-caterpillar combination is hand-collected for medicinal use.

In traditional Chinese medicine, it is regarded as having an excellent balance of yin and yang as it is considered to be composed of both an animal and a vegetable. They are now cultivated on an industrial scale for their use in traditional Chinese medicine. However, no one has succeeded so far in rearing the fungus by infecting cultivated caterpillars; all products derived from cultured &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; are derived from mycelia grown on grains or in liquids.

==Economics and impact==
In rural Tibet, &quot;yartsa gunbu&quot; has become the most important source of cash income. The fungi contributed 40% of the annual cash income to local households and 8.5% to the GDP in 2004. Prices have increased continuously, especially since the late 1990s. In 2008, one kilogram traded for US$3,000 (lowest quality) to over US$18,000 (best quality, largest larvae). The annual production on the Tibetan Plateau was estimated in 2009 at 80–175 tons. The Himalayan &quot;Ophiocordyceps&quot; production might not exceed a few tons.

In 2004 the value of a kilogram of caterpillars was estimated at 30,000 to 60,000 Nepali rupees in Nepal, and about Rs 100,000 in India. In 2011, the value of a kilogram of caterpillars was estimated at 350,000 to 450,000 Nepali rupees in Nepal. A 2012 BBC article indicated that in north Indian villages a single fungus was worth Rs 150 (about £2 or $3), which is more than the daily wage of a manual labourer. In 2012, a pound of top-quality yartsa had reached retail prices of $50,000.
The price of &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; is reported to have increased dramatically on the Tibetan Plateau, about 900% between 1998 and 2008, an annual average of over 20% (after inflation). However, the value of large caterpillar fungus has increased more dramatically than small &quot;Cordyceps&quot;, regarded as lower quality.
Because of its high value, inter-village conflicts over access to its grassland habitats has become a headache for the local governing bodies and in several cases people were killed. In November 2011, a court in Nepal convicted 19 villagers over the murder of a group of farmers during a fight over the prized aphrodisiac fungus. Seven farmers were killed in the remote northern district of Manang in June 2009 after going to forage for Yarchagumba.

Its value gave it a role in the Nepalese Civil War, as the Nepalese Maoists and government forces fought for control of the lucrative export trade during the June–July harvest season. Collecting &quot;yarchagumba&quot; in Nepal had only been legalised in 2001, and now demand is highest in countries such as China, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea and Japan. By 2002, the &#x27;herb&#x27; was valued at R 105,000 ($1,435) per kilogram, allowing the government to charge a royalty of R 20,000 ($280) per kilogram.

The search for &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; is often perceived to threaten the environment of the Tibetan Plateau where it grows. While it has been collected for centuries and is still common in such areas, current collection rates are much higher than in historical times.

In the Kingdom of Bhutan, &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; is recently also being harvested. The quality of the Bhutanese variety has been shown to be equal to the Tibetan one.

Cultivated &quot;O. sinensis&quot; mycelium is an alternative to wild-harvested &quot;O. sinensis&quot;, and producers claim it may offer improved consistency. Artificial culture of &quot;O. sinensis&quot; is typically by growth of pure mycelia in liquid culture (in China) or on grains (in the West).

In Vietnam, according to the statistics of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the production of cultivated &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; in Vietnam in 2022 reached about 1,000 tons, an increase of five times compared to 2017. The selling price of fresh &quot;O. sinensis&quot; ranges from 10-20 million VND/kg, while dried &quot;O. sinensis&quot; ranges from 100-200 million VND/kg. Therefore, the economic value of cultivated &quot;O. sinensis&quot; in Vietnam is estimated to be around 10,000 billion VND/year. In the period 2017-2022, the production of cultivated &quot;O. sinensis&quot; has grown at an average rate of 40%/year..

In India, fuelwood cutting by &quot;Ophiocordyceps sinensis&quot; collectors near the treeline is reported to be depleting populations of tree species such as of Himalayan birch &quot;Betula utilis&quot;&quot;.&quot;

==Second Boer War==

On the outbreak of war in 1899 an Army Corps of three divisions was sent to South Africa from the UK; the troops already there constituted the 4th Division. The rapid deterioration of the situation led the War Office to announce on 11 November 1899 that a 5th Division was to be formed and sent out. This consisted of the 10th and 11th (Lancashire) Brigades and concentrated at Estcourt on 8 January 1900. Under the command of Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Warren, 5th Division joined up with the Natal Field Force shortly after the Battle of Colenso and was a part of the relieving army of the besieged Ladysmith.

==First World War==
The 5th Division was a permanently established Regular Army division that was amongst the first to be sent to France as part of the original British Expeditionary Force (BEF) at the outbreak of the First World War. It served on the Western Front for most of the war except for a brief period on the Italian Front from 27 November 1917 to 1 April 1918. The 5th Division, as a Regular Army formation (one of the Old Contemptibles) fought in many of the major battles of the Western Front from the Battle of Mons in 1914, the later stages of the Somme offensive, including the first battle using tanks, up to the Battle of the Selle in 1918.

===Insignia===
The 5th Division was unusual among other British divisions in that no battle patches were worn on their tunics or helmets, aside from those briefly worn by New Army battalions bringing them from their former division.

==Interwar period==
During the interwar period, the division spent time based in Egypt and then in Palestine. The latter occurred during the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine.

==Second World War==
Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, the 5th Infantry Division was a Regular Army formation, commanded by Major-General Harold Franklyn, who had been in command since 1938. The division was based at Catterick under Northern Command. Both of its infantry brigades (the 13th and 15th) went to France to join the rest of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in early October 1939 as independent infantry brigades, but the divisional Headquarters crossed to France on 19 December 1939, coming under the command of Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke&#x27;s II Corps from 23 December. By the new year of 1940 the division was reformed with three infantry brigades –the 13th, 15th and 17th, all commanded by men who would achieve high rank in the next few years.

===Globe Trotting===
Throughout the early months of 1940 the division saw some changing of units, as the Territorial Army (TA) divisions began to arrive in France from the United Kingdom. This was part of official BEF policy, based on experience from the Great War, and was intended to strengthen the inexperienced TA formations with experienced Regulars, although at the same time diluting the strength of the Regular divisions with inexperienced TA units. Despite this, the division still maintained its integrity as a Regular formation. The next few months were spent in training, although this was hampered by severe shortages of modern equipment. Due to the lack of immediate action many soldiers believed the war would amount to very little. Despite this, morale in the division was high. This period of inactivity was known as the &quot;Phoney War&quot;.

In mid-April the 15th Brigade was sent to Norway and fought, very briefly, in the unsuccessful Norwegian campaign, evacuating from there and arriving in the United Kingdom in early May, although it did not rejoin the 5th Division until 3 July 1940. In early May the 25th Infantry Brigade came temporarily under command of the division in France. The German Army launched its attack in the West on 10 May 1940 and the 5th Division saw action in the battles of Belgium and France in May–June 1940 including the Battle of Arras, supported by the 1st Army Tank Brigade, on 21 May 1940 and at the Battle of the Ypres-Comines Canal from 26 to 28 May 1940, and then was withdrawn to Dunkirk, along with the rest of the BEF, where they were evacuated to England, with most of the division arriving on 1 June. Lieutenant-General Brooke, commanding II Corps, wrote in his diary that there &quot;is no doubt that the 5th Div in its fight on the Ypres-Comines canal saved the II Corps and the BEF&quot;.

The division, having sustained very heavy losses, remained in the United Kingdom for the next 21 months, with most of 1940 being spent in Scotland under Scottish Command, reforming in numbers and being brought up to strength with large numbers of conscripts, alongside training in anti-invasion duties and preparing for Operation Sea Lion, the German invasion of the United Kingdom which never arrived. In late March 1941 the division, now under the command of Major-General Horatio Berney-Ficklin, who had taken over in July 1940 (and previously commanded the 15th Brigade), was sent to Northern Ireland, coming under command of Lieutenant-General James Marshall-Cornwall&#x27;s III Corps, under overall control of British Troops Northern Ireland, and, as in Scotland, continued training to repel a German invasion there (see Operation Green).

The division left Northern Ireland on 16 March 1942 and served and travelled in so many regions of the world that they were known as the &quot;Globe Trotters&quot;, and became the most travelled division of the British Army during the Second World War. In April 1942 the 13th and 17th Infantry Brigades and a portion of the divisional troops were detached to &#x27;Force 121&#x27; for Operation Ironclad, the invasion of Vichy French held Madagascar. The division was not complete again until August 1942. It was sent from the United Kingdom to India for three months and then to Middle East Command, where it trained in mountain warfare.

In mid-February 1943 the division was sent to Syria, remaining there for the next four months, and later Egypt, where it came under the command of British XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey (who earlier had commanded the 13th Brigade in France and Belgium in 1940), which was part of the British Eighth Army, under General Sir Bernard Montgomery. The division, serving again alongside the 50th Division, began training in amphibious operations in preparation for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.

===Sicily, Italy and North-Western Europe===
The 5th Division saw action during the invasion of Sicily where, towards the end of the campaign, in early August, the divisional commander, Major-General Berney-Ficklin, who had commanded the division since July 1940, was replaced by Major-General Gerard Bucknall. The division was pulled out of the line and absorbed replacements, and invaded the Italian mainland in Operation Baytown on 3 September (four years since Britain&#x27;s entry into the war), still as part of XIII Corps of the Eighth Army, but now serving alongside the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, and advanced up the spine of Italy. Later in the year, the division fought in the Moro River Campaign, although sustaining relatively light casualties in comparison to the other Allied formations involved.

Progress for the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI), commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander, towards the end of 1943 had slowed down considerably, due mainly to a combination of worsening weather, stiffening German resistance and the Winter Line (also known as the Gustav Line, a series of formidable defences the Germans had created). The Eighth Army, operating on the Adriatic coast, had already pierced the Gustav Line at its eastern end. However, the appalling weather conditions forbade further progress and so operations there were closed down. As a result, the relatively intact 5th Division was available elsewhere. Therefore, in early January 1944 the division was transferred from the Eighth Army, now under Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, to the western side of Italy to join Lieutenant-General Richard McCreery&#x27;s British X Corps. X Corps, stationed along the Garigliano river, was part of Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark&#x27;s U.S. Fifth Army. The division, now commanded by Major-General Philip Gregson-Ellis and with the veteran 201st Guards Brigade now under command, crossed the Garigliano river as part of the First Battle of Monte Cassino where it gained considerable territory.

In March 1944 the division, after holding its positions that it gained during the battle, was transferred again, this time to the Anzio bridgehead (or, more appropriately, beachhead) where they came under command of Major General Lucian Truscott&#x27;s U.S. VI Corps and relieved the battered 56th Division, which was returning to the Middle East. Although by this time the major battles for the Anzio beachhead were over, the division was involved in minor skirmishing and operating in conditions more reminiscent of the trench warfare of the First World War. In May the division participated in Operation Diadem and the breakout from Anzio, which led to the capture of the Italian capital of Rome in early June. During the fighting, Sergeant Maurice Rogers of the 2nd Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the first and only to be awarded to the 5th Division during the Second World War. Soon afterwards the division, having sustained just under 3,000 casualties since its arrival at Anzio three months before, was then withdrawn to Palestine, arriving there in mid-July. The division then came under command of Persia and Transjordan Command.

The division, now commanded by the relatively young Major-General Richard Hull, who, at the age of 37, was the youngest division commander in the British Army (and later destined to become Chief of the General Staff and Chief of the Defence Staff), returned to Italy in early 1945 where they relieved the 1st Infantry Division, which had fought alongside the Globetrotters at Anzio. Soon afterwards, however, the division was transferred to the Western Front in March 1945 to participate in the final stages of the North West Europe campaign. Arriving in Belgium just after the British crossing of the Rhine, the division came under command of VIII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Evelyn Barker, part of the British Second Army, under Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey, and took part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, closely supported by elements of the 6th Guards Armoured Brigade.

Throughout the Second World War, the British 5th Infantry Division used a &#x27;Y&#x27; on a khaki background as its insignia.

==Post War and Cold War==

The division remained in Germany, undertaking occupation duties, into the immediate post-war period. Major-General John Churcher was the final commander, taking command in July 1947 and the division was disbanded two months later in September. In April 1958, as part of a restructure undertaken by the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), the 7th Armoured Division was converted into and became the newly revived 5th Division and was headquartered at Verden an der Aller, Germany. This incarnation of the division lasted until 30 June 1960. The following day, 1 July, it was redesignated as the 1st Division and took on that formation&#x27;s lineage and insignia.

On 1 April 1968, the Army Strategic Command was formed in the UK, with a goal of supporting NATO forces from as far north as Norway to as far south as Turkey; to provide internal security operations world-wide; and to undertake limited operations alongside allied forces. In conjunction with this command being formed, the 5th Division was resurrected at Wrexham. During this period, it consisted of the 2nd, the 8th, and the 39th Infantry Brigades. However, with the onset of Operation Banner, the deployment of British troops to Northern Ireland during The Troubles, the division was disbanded on 26 February 1971 as it was no longer needed.

==Final decades==
During the mid-1990s, the British Army restructured and disbanded various regional districts, which were replaced by several regionally based divisions. This included the reformed 5th Division, alongside the 2nd and the 4th Divisions. These formations were all dubbed &quot;regenerative&quot; divisions, and held administrative and training responsibilities for all non-deployed forces located within their geographical boundaries. For the 5th Division, this included Wales, the West Midlands, and North West England. In the event of a major international crisis, the formation would be used as the core to form a combat-ready division around. On reformation (April 1995), the division was headquartered in Shrewsbury and comprised the 42nd Brigade (headquartered in Preston, Lancashire), the 143rd Brigade (Shrewsbury), and the 160th Infantry Brigades (Brecon). At the time, it was around 4,600 strong and also contained 97 artillery pieces, one multiple launch rocket system, two helicopters, and 123 tracked vehicles.

As part of its training mandate, the division dispatched troops to train in Belize, was the first British formation to undertake training operations in Slovakia, and regularly worked with the Army Cadet Force. In addition to training, the division was held responsible for environmental conservation in areas that it oversaw. It also conducted a number of UK-based humanitarian missions in the early 2000s. During Operation Waterfowl, the division assisted those effected by the Autumn 2000 Western Europe floods. In 2001, the division supported farmers across the country, as well as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, during the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak (its deployment falling under the codename Operation Peninsular). The same year, it also sent troops to join the Stabilisation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Operation Palatine).

By the mid-2000s, the division&#x27;s boundaries had changed. The 2nd Division was assigned northern England and the 42nd Brigade. In turn, the 5th Division&#x27;s area of responsibility was expanded so that it stretched from Wales, across the Midlands, and included the East of England. It also took command of the 49th (East) Brigade. The opening decade of the millennium saw the outbreak of the War on terror, which resulted in British deployments to Afghanistan (Operation Herrick) and Iraq (Operation Telic and the division prepared troops for deployments to these conflicts. It also sent troops to the Falkland Islands.

The Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010 identified that the army had had become optimised for operations in Afghanistan, but in order to meet potential future threats would need to be reorgnised to become more flexible. This restructure was called Army 2020 and resulted in the decision to disband the three regional regenerative divisions, to be replaced by Support Command, with the aim of making the home-based forces better able to support any deployed troops. The 5th Division was disbanded alongside the 2nd during April 2012, with the 4th Division preceding them in January.

<text>The Manchester Evening News (MEN) is a regional daily newspaper covering Greater Manchester in North West England, founded in 1868. It is published Monday–Saturday; a Sunday edition, the MEN on Sunday, was launched in February 2019. The newspaper is owned by Reach plc (formerly Trinity Mirror),[2] one of Britain&#x27;s largest newspaper publishing groups.

Since adopting a &#x27;digital-first&#x27; strategy in 2014, the &quot;MEN&quot; has experienced significant online growth, despite its average print daily circulation for the first half of 2021 falling to 22,107. In the 2018 British Regional Press Awards, it was named Newspaper of the Year and Website of the Year.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;The Guardian&quot; ownership===
The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; was first published on 10 October 1868 by Mitchell Henry as part of his parliamentary election campaign, its first issue four pages long and costing a halfpenny. The newspaper was run from a small office on Brown Street, with approximately a dozen staff. Upon the newspaper&#x27;s launch, Henry said: &quot;In putting ourselves into print, we have no apology to offer, but the assurance of an honest aim to serve the public interest.&quot; Henry&#x27;s quote is displayed on the entrance wall to the newspaper&#x27;s modern offices.

With his Parliamentary bid unsuccessful, Henry lost interest in the business, selling the publication to John Edward Taylor Jr., the son of newspaper proprietor John Edward Taylor, founder of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; (now &quot;The Guardian&quot;). The newspaper became the evening counterpart and sister title to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; and the two titles began sharing an office, located on Cross Street, from 1879. Taylor brought his brother-in-law Peter Allen in as a partner in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and, after Taylor&#x27;s death in 1907, the &quot;Guardian&quot; was sold to its editor C. P. Scott while the &quot;Evening News&quot; passed into the hands of the Allen family. In 1924, C. P. Scott&#x27;s son John Russell Scott reunited the papers, buying out the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and forming The Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd, which in turn later became the Guardian Media Group (GMG).
In 1936, John Russell Scott formed the Scott Trust in order to protect the company from death duties, following the deaths of his father and younger brother Ted in close succession. The contents of the original deeds were not disclosed by the company, but a copy obtained by &quot;The Independent&quot; revealed the terms compelled trustees to &quot;use their best endeavours to procure that the [...] &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; and &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; [...] shall be carried on as nearly as may be upon the same principles as they have heretofore.&quot;

During the editorship of William Haley (who later became the Director-General of the BBC and subsequently the editor of &quot;The Times&quot;) in the 1930s, the newspaper&#x27;s circulation grew to over 200,000. By 1939 the publication was the largest provincial evening newspaper in the country. The newspaper was a cash cow for its parent company and kept its stablemate &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; afloat. The financial success of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; was reflected in Haley&#x27;s salary, which was even greater than John Scott&#x27;s, with Scott himself acknowledging, &quot;after all, you make the money we spend.&quot;

In 1961, The Manchester Guardian and Evening News Ltd bought out the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;″s ailing rival, the &quot;Manchester Evening Chronicle&quot;, and two years later, merged the papers. Following this, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;″s circulation increased to over 480,000.

From 2004 until July 2009, the newspaper collaborated with Channel M to produce that Manchester-area TV station&#x27;s flagship programme, the 5pm weeknight edition of &quot;Channel M News.&quot; The programme later expanded to include bulletins at breakfast, lunchtime and late evening, a weekly review programme, and also occasional live specials.

===Trinity Mirror acquisition===
In December 2009, GMG confirmed it had held &quot;exploratory talks&quot; about selling the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, following a report by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which named Trinity Mirror as a potential buyer and claimed the &quot;disposal would amount to a fire sale&quot; due to the current value of the business. The title estimated the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; alone to be worth about £200m prior to the collapse in newspaper advertising.
In February 2010, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; was sold along with GMG&#x27;s 31 other regional titles to Trinity Mirror, severing the historic link between &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;. The sale was valued at £44.8m – £7.4m in cash and the remainder from GMG extricating itself from a £37.4m decade-long contract with Trinity Mirror to print its regional titles. The sale of GMG&#x27;s regional arm was negotiated to offset company losses, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; and its Sunday title &quot;Observer&quot; accruing losses of £100,000 a day. The sale was described by stockbrokers Numis as &quot;the deal of the decade&quot; for Sly Bailey, Trinity Mirror&#x27;s chief executive, while &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Steve Busfield said the sale was indicative of the declining business value of regional media, comparing the sale to that of Johnston Press&#x27;s acquisition of 53 regional titles including &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot; eight years earlier, for £560m.

In the year prior to the newspaper&#x27;s sale, GMG had reduced the number of journalists at the newspaper to 50. Judy Gordon, the National Union of Journalists mother of the chapel, said: &quot;&quot;The Guardian&quot; has not got any money of its own. It has only got what other people give it. We&#x27;ve made all those changes to stem the fact that our profits are dropping. Then they ask: &#x27;How much can you give us now? Nothing? OK, Bye.&#x27;&quot;

The &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; headquarters were relocated from Scott Place in the Spinningfields area of Manchester city centre to an existing Trinity Mirror plant in Chadderton, where other Trinity Mirror titles in North West England are printed. In 2013, the title surpassed 10 million monthly online readers for the first time, recording 10,613,119 visitors.

==Editions==

Despite its &quot;evening&quot; title, the newspaper began publication of a morning edition in November 2004, a controversial move which brought union members to the brink of strike action over new work rotas.

===&quot;Football Green&quot; and &quot;Football Pink&quot;===
For years the paper was famous for its &quot;Football Green&quot; edition. After the MEN merged with the rival &quot;Manchester Evening Chronicle&quot; in the 1960s, its more popular &quot;Sporting Pink&quot; was adopted as the &quot;Football Pink&quot;. The &quot;Football Pink&quot; was first issued in 1904 as part of the &quot;Manchester Evening Chronicle&quot;, which was owned by Manchester City chairman Sir Edward Hulton, 1st Baronet.

The &quot;Green&quot; and &quot;Pink&quot; names came from being printed in paper of those colours. In the 1970s the Saturday sports paper began using white newsprint, which had become by then the industry standard. The football results were added to a pre-printed newspaper using small presses in newspaper vans usually parked near the stadiums. The final edition of the &quot;Football Pink&quot; was dated 12 August 2000.

===MEN Lite===
In March 2005 the paper launched a cut-down afternoon version of the paper titled &quot;MEN Lite&quot;, which was distributed free to commuters within Manchester&#x27;s city centre.

===Part-free===
On 2 May 2006 the &quot;Evening News&quot; dropped the &quot;Lite&quot; edition in favour of a &quot;part-free, part-paid&quot; distribution model for the main paper. Copies were free in Manchester city centre, while readers outside that area continued to pay for the paper.

In December 2006, the paper also began free distribution at Manchester Airport and hospitals throughout Greater Manchester.

In December 2009, the newspaper announced that as of January 2010 the paper would no longer be handed out free Monday to Wednesday in the city centre and other selected locations. Instead they would be handed out free as previously on Thursdays and Fridays, but would regain their paid-for status in these locations at all other times.

===&quot;Manchester Weekly News&quot;===
A free weekly version of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, the &quot;Manchester Weekly News&quot;, was launched 2 April 2015. The paper is delivered to over 265,000 homes in Greater Manchester.

===&quot;City Life&quot; affiliation===
&quot;City Life&quot; – originally an independent political and cultural magazine for the Manchester area – was acquired by GMG in 1989. In December 2007, &quot;City Life&quot; ceased independent publication, subsequently becoming a 20-page supplement to the Friday issue of the &quot;Manchester Evening News.&quot;

<text>Dame Elizabeth Jane Campion (born 30 April 1954) is a New Zealand filmmaker. She is best known for writing and directing the critically acclaimed films &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; (2021), for which she has received two Academy Awards (including Best Director for the latter), two BAFTA Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. Campion was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DNZM) in the 2016 New Year Honours, for services to film.

Campion is a groundbreaking female director, the only woman to be nominated twice for Academy Award for Best Director (winning once), and the first female filmmaker to receive the Palme d&#x27;Or (for &quot;The Piano&quot;, which also won her the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay). She made history at the 94th Academy Awards when she won Best Director for &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot; (2021), as the oldest female director to win and the first woman to win Academy Awards for both directing and screenwriting in her different films. She broke the same barrier at the 78th Venice International Film Festival when she won the Silver Lion award. She is the third woman to win the Directors Guild of America Award for Feature Film.

Campion is also known for directing the films &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1990), &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot; (1996), &quot;Holy Smoke!&quot; (1998), and &quot;Bright Star&quot; (2009). She also co-created the television series &quot;Top of the Lake&quot; (2013) and received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

==Early life==
Campion was born in Wellington, New Zealand, the second daughter of Edith Campion (born Beverley Georgette Hannah), an actress, writer, and heiress; and Richard M. Campion, a teacher, and theatre and opera director. Her maternal great-grandfather was Robert Hannah, a well-known shoe manufacturer for whom Antrim House was built. Her father came from a family that belonged to the fundamentalist Christian Exclusive Brethren sect. She attended Queen Margaret College and Wellington Girls&#x27; College. Along with her sister, Anna, a year and a half her senior, and brother, Michael, seven years her junior, Campion grew up in the world of New Zealand theatre. Their parents founded the New Zealand Players. Campion initially rejected the idea of a career in the dramatic arts and graduated instead with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology from Victoria University of Wellington in 1975.

In 1976, she enrolled in the Chelsea Art School in London and travelled throughout Europe. She earned a graduate diploma in visual arts (painting) from the Sydney College of the Arts at the University of Sydney in 1981. Campion&#x27;s later film work was shaped in part by her art school education; she has, even in her mature career, cited painter Frida Kahlo and sculptor Joseph Beuys as influences.

Campion&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the limitations of painting led her to filmmaking and the creation of her first short, &quot;Tissues,&quot; in 1980. In 1981, she began studying at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, where she made several more short films and graduated in 1984.

Campion&#x27;s first short film, &quot;Peel&quot; (1982), won the Short Film &quot;Palme d&#x27;Or&quot; at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival, and other awards followed for the shorts &quot;Passionless Moments&quot; (1983), &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Own Story&quot; (1984), and &quot;After Hours&quot; (1984). After leaving the Australian Film and Television School, she directed an episode for ABC&#x27;s light entertainment series &quot;Dancing Daze&quot; (1986), which led to her first TV film, &quot;Two Friends&quot; (1986), produced by Jan Chapman. Her feature debut, &quot;Sweetie&quot; (1989), won international awards.

=== 1990–2006 ===
Further recognition came with &quot;An Angel at My Table&quot; (1990), a biopic about the life of New Zealand writer Janet Frame, from a screenplay written by Laura Jones. Widespread recognition followed with &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993), which won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, Best Director from the Australian Film Institute, and an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1994. At the 66th Academy Awards, Campion was the second woman ever to be nominated for Best Director for her movie &quot;The Piano&quot;.

Campion&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;The Portrait of a Lady&quot;, based on the Henry James novel, featured Nicole Kidman, John Malkovich, Barbara Hershey and Martin Donovan. &quot;Holy Smoke!&quot; (1999) saw Campion teamed with Harvey Keitel for a second time (the first being &quot;The Piano&quot;), this time with Kate Winslet as the female lead. &quot;In the Cut&quot; (2003), an erotic thriller based on Susanna Moore&#x27;s bestseller, provided Meg Ryan an opportunity to depart from her more familiar onscreen persona. In 2006 she produced &quot;&quot;.

=== 2009–present ===
Her 2009 film &quot;Bright Star,&quot; a biographical drama about poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw) and his lover Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. In an interview with Jan Lisa Huttner, Campion discussed how she focused on Fanny&#x27;s side of the story, pointing out that only two of the film&#x27;s scenes did not feature her. Campion created, wrote, and directed the TV mini-series &quot;Top of the Lake&quot;, which received near universal acclaim, won numerous awards—including, for its lead actress Elisabeth Moss, a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries—and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. Campion was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.

She was the head of the jury for the Cinéfondation and Short Film sections at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and the head of the jury for the main competition section of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. When Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan received the Prix du Jury for his film &quot;Mommy&quot;, he said that Campion&#x27;s &quot;The Piano&quot; &quot;made me want to write roles for women—beautiful women with soul, will and strength, not victims or objects.&quot; Campion responded by rising from her seat to give him a hug. In 2014, it was announced that Campion was nearing a deal to direct an adaptation of Rachel Kushner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Flamethrowers&quot;.

In 2015, Campion confirmed that she would co-direct and co-write a second season of &quot;Top of the Lake&quot; with the story moved to Sydney and Harbour City, Hong Kong, and with Elisabeth Moss reprising her role as Robin Griffin. The sequel series titled &quot;Top of the Lake: China Girl&quot; was released in 2017. Shot and set in Sydney, &quot;Top of the Lake: China Girl&quot; features Alice Englert, Campion&#x27;s daughter, in a lead role as Robin&#x27;s biological daughter. The series also features Ewen Leslie, David Dencik and Nicole Kidman.

In 2019, Campion&#x27;s first film in a decade was announced, an adaptation of Thomas Savage&#x27;s novel &quot;The Power of the Dog&quot;. The film was written and directed by her and was released in 2021, having premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival, where Campion was awarded the Silver Lion for Best Direction. The film was critically acclaimed internationally, winning numerous awards and nominations for the direction, screenplay, and performance of the cast of actors. Campion earned three nominations in the respective categories for Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture at the Golden Globe Awards, AACTA International Awards, Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards, and Satellite Awards. Campion issued an apology to Serena and Venus Williams following criticism of her acceptance speech for Critics Choice for Best Director, in which Campion said, &quot;And you know, Serena and Venus, you are such marvels. However, you do not play against the guys — like I have to.&quot; Her apology included, &quot;I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved,&quot; she said. &quot;I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world-class athletes.&quot; In February 2022, the film received 12 nominations at the 94th Academy Awards, leading that year&#x27;s Oscar nominations. The film was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor for Benedict Cumberbatch, Best Supporting Actress for Kirsten Dunst, and Best Supporting Actor for both Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons. Campion became the first woman to receive multiple Best Director nominations, and she won Best Director for the film. She is also the first woman to win Best Director without also winning a corresponding Best Picture.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Campion married Colin David Englert, an Australian who worked as a second unit director on &quot;The Piano&quot;. Their first child, Jasper, was born in 1993 but lived for only 12 days. Their second child, Alice Englert, was born in 1994; she is an actress. The couple divorced in 2001.

==Reception==
Her work, according to the critic bell hooks, &quot;seduces and excites audiences with its uncritical portrayal of sexism and misogyny. Reviewers and audiences alike seem to assume that Campion&#x27;s gender, as well as her breaking of traditional boundaries that inhibit the advancement of women in film, indicate that her work expresses a feminist standpoint.&quot; Accordingly, Campion&#x27;s work has received praise from other critics. In V.W. Wexman&#x27;s &quot;Jane Campion: Interviews&quot; (1999), critic David Thomson describes Campion &quot;as one of the best young directors in the world today.&quot; In Sue Gillett&#x27;s &quot;More Than Meets The Eye: The Mediation of Affects in Jane Campion&#x27;s &quot;Sweetie&quot;&quot;, Campion&#x27;s work is described as &quot;perhaps the fullest and truest way of being faithful to the reality of experience&quot;; by utilising the &quot;unsayable&quot; and &quot;unseeable&quot;, she manages to catalyze audience speculation. Campion&#x27;s films tend to gravitate around themes of gender politics, such as seduction and female sexual power. This has led some to label Campion&#x27;s body of work as feminist; however, Rebecca Flint Marx argues that &quot;while not inaccurate, [the feminist label] fails to fully capture the dilemmas of her characters and the depth of her work.&quot;

==Honours and accolades==

Campion was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DNZM) in the 2016 New Year Honours, for services to film.

==Construction==
&quot;Ajax&quot; was built by Cammell Laird of Birkenhead. She was laid down, with the yard number 1285, as a to be called &quot;Fowey&quot; on 19 October 1959, but in 1960 it was decided to complete the ship as one of the new &quot;Leander&quot; class, with the new name &quot;Ajax&quot;. &quot;Ajax&quot; was launched on 16 August 1962 and was commissioned on 11 December 1963. Total construction cost was £4,800,000

The ship was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a maximum draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired boilers fed steam at and to a pair of double reduction geared steam turbines that in turn drove two propeller shafts, with the machinery rated at , giving a speed of .

A twin Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward. While the &quot;Leander&quot; class was planned to be fitted with the Sea Cat surface-to-air missile, &quot;Ajax&quot; was completed with two Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns as a temporary substitute until Sea Cat could be fitted. A Limbo anti-submarine mortar was fitted aft to provide a short-range anti-submarine capability, while a hangar and helicopter deck allowed a single Westland Wasp helicopter to be operated, for longer range anti-submarine and anti-surface operations.

As built, &quot;Ajax&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 974 navigation radar carried on the ship&#x27;s foremast. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar, while the ship was designed to carry a Type 199 variable depth sonar (VDS), this was not installed on &quot;Ajax&quot;.

==Service history==
In early 1964 &quot;Ajax&quot; assisted the Swedish &quot;MV Solklint&quot; after it collided with the &quot;Cissoula&quot; in the English Channel. Later in 1964, &quot;Ajax&quot; was deployed to the Far East, becoming the leader of the 24th Escort Group. It was a long deployment, and she did not return to the UK until 1968. Activities included taking part in the Beira Patrol, covering the withdrawal of British forces from operations off Aden, and acting as guardship for Hong Kong. In 1970, &quot;Ajax&quot; became the Gibraltar guard ship, a required deployment at that time due to the tense fears of invasion by General Franco.

In September 1970, &quot;Ajax&quot; began a modernisation at Devonport Dockyard that lasted until 1973, having her 4.5-inch gun turret replaced by an Ikara anti-submarine missile system. A pair of quadruple GWS22 SeaCat launchers were fitted aft while the two Bofors guns were retained but moved forward to abreast the ship&#x27;s mainmast. The Limbo anti-submarine mortar and Wasp helicopter were retained. The long-range Type 965 radar was removed, with improved navigation and target indicating radars fitted, and the ADAWS 5 computer-aided combat direction system added to direct Ikara operations, while the Type 199 VDS was restored.

Following her conversion she became leader of the 8th Frigate Squadron. In 1974, she assisted in the evacuation of British citizens after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. In 1976, while on a visit to Canada, &quot;Ajax&quot; visited the town of Ajax, Ontario, which had been named in honour of her predecessor, the &quot;Leander&quot;-class cruiser &quot;Ajax&quot; made famous by the Battle of the River Plate during the Second World War. The &#x27;new&#x27; &quot;Ajax&quot; was granted the freedom of the city.

In 1977, &quot;Ajax&quot; underwent a refit at Devonport Dockyard, deploying in 1979 to the Mediterranean. In 1980, she underwent a refit at Gibraltar which was completed in 1981. That year, &quot;Ajax&quot; became the leader of the 1st Frigate Squadron. She did not take part in the 1982 Falklands War, but was deployed as Persian Gulf guard ship; she later completed a four-month deployment around the Falklands as part of the South Atlantic Protection Force in 1984. She participated in further deployments that culminated in the highlight of her final year in 1985 when she escorted , which took a number of the Royal Family on a tour of Italy.

==Fate==
She was decommissioned 31 May 1985, then replaced as a static training ship at Devonport. On 3 August 1988, &quot;Ajax&quot; arrived at Millom, Cumbria to be broken up.

Her anchor is now located at the local Royal Canadian Legion Branch (Hunt Street) and bell hangs in the Ajax Town Council Chamber in Ajax, Ontario.

<text>Serenoa repens, commonly known as saw palmetto, is a small palm, growing to a maximum height around . 

== Taxonomy ==
It is the sole species in the genus Serenoa. The genus name honors American botanist Sereno Watson.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It is endemic to the subtropical and tropical Southeastern United States as well as Mexico, most commonly along the south Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains and sand hills. It grows in clumps or dense thickets in sandy coastal areas, and as undergrowth in pine woods or hardwood hammocks.

==Description==
Erect stems or trunks are rarely produced, but are found in some populations. It is a hardy plant; extremely slow-growing, and long-lived, with some plants (especially in Florida) possibly being as old as 500–700 years.

Saw palmetto is a fan palm, with the leaves that have a bare petiole terminating in a rounded fan of about 20 leaflets. The petiole is armed with fine, sharp teeth or spines that give the species its common name. The teeth or spines are easily capable of breaking the skin, and protection should be worn when working around a saw palmetto. The leaves are light green inland, and silvery-white in coastal regions. The leaves are 1–2 m in length, the leaflets 50–100 cm long. They are similar to the leaves of the palmettos of genus &quot;Sabal&quot;. The flowers are yellowish-white, about 5 mm across, produced in dense compound panicles up to 60 cm long.

== Ecology ==
The fruit is a large reddish-black drupe and is an important food source for wildlife and historically for humans. The plant is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species such as &quot;Batrachedra decoctor&quot;, which feeds on the plant, including the interior of the inflorescence.

==Medical research==
Saw palmetto extract has been studied as a possible treatment for people with prostate cancer and for men with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). As of 2023, there is insufficient scientific evidence that saw palmetto extract is effective for treating cancer or BPH and its symptoms.

One 2016 review of clinical studies with a standardized extract of saw palmetto (called &quot;Permixon&quot;) found that the extract was safe and may be effective for relieving BPH-induced urinary symptoms compared against a placebo.

==Ethnobotany==
Indigenous names are reported to include: or (&quot;palmetto&#x27;s uncle&quot;) in Choctaw; (Timucua); (Koasati); (&quot;big palm&quot;, Alabama); (&quot;big palm&quot;, Creek); (&quot;big palm&quot;, Mikasuki); and (Taíno, possibly). Saw palmetto fibers have been found among materials from indigenous people as far north as Wisconsin and New York, strongly suggesting this material was widely traded prior to European contact. The leaves are used for thatching by several indigenous groups, so commonly that a location in Alachua County, Florida, is named Kanapaha (&quot;palm house&quot;). The fruit may have been used to treat an unclear form of fish poisoning by the Seminoles and Lucayans.

<text>Robert Bellarmine Carl Katter (born 22 May 1945) is an Australian politician who has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1993. He was previously active in Queensland state politics from 1974 to 1992. Katter was a member of the National Party until 2001, when he left to sit as an independent. He formed his own party, Katter&#x27;s Australian Party, in 2011.

Katter was born in Cloncurry, Queensland. His father, Bob Katter Sr., was also a politician. Katter was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the 1974 state election, representing the seat of Flinders. He was elevated to cabinet in 1983, under Joh Bjelke-Petersen, and was a government minister until the National Party&#x27;s defeat at the 1989 state election.

Katter left state politics in 1992, and the following year was elected to federal parliament standing in the Division of Kennedy (his father&#x27;s old seat). He resigned from the National Party in the lead-up to the 2001 federal election, and has since been re-elected four more times as an independent and another four times for his own party. His son, Robbie Katter, is a state MP in Queensland, the third generation of the family to be a member of parliament.

==Early life, education and career==
Katter was born on 22 May 1945 in Cloncurry, Queensland. He is the one of three children born to Mabel Joan () and Robert Cummin Katter; his mother died in 1971 and his father had three more children with his second wife, including Carl.

Katter&#x27;s father was raised in Cloncurry where he ran a clothing shop and managed a local cinema. He was elected to Cloncurry Shire Council in 1946 and to federal parliament in 1966. Katter is of Lebanese descent through his paternal grandfather Carl Robert Katter (originally spelled &quot;Khittar&quot;), who was born in Bsharri and immigrated to Australia with his parents in 1898. He was naturalised in 1907, after previously being refused naturalisation under the White Australia policy. 

Katter received his early education in Cloncurry, where he was one of only six at his school who finished year 12. He attended Mount Carmel College in Charters Towers. He went on to the University of Queensland, where he studied law, but later dropped out without graduating. While at university, Katter was President of the University of Queensland Law Society and St Leo&#x27;s College. As a university student, Katter pelted the Beatles with rotten eggs during their 1964 tour of Australia, declaring in a later meeting with the band that he undertook this as &quot;an intellectual reaction against Beatlemania&quot;. He also served in the Citizens Military Forces, with the rank of second lieutenant.

Returning to Cloncurry, he worked in his family&#x27;s businesses, and as a labourer with the Mount Isa Mines.

==State politics (1974–1992)==
Katter&#x27;s father was a member of the Australian Labor Party until 1957, when he left during the Labor split of that year. He later joined the Country Party, now the National Party. The younger Katter was a Country Party member of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland from 1974 to 1992, representing Flinders in north Queensland. He was Minister for Northern Development and Aboriginal and Islander Affairs from 1983 to 1987, Minister for Northern Development, Community Services and Ethnic Affairs from 1987 to 1989, Minister for Community Services and Ethnic Affairs in 1989, Minister for Mines and Energy in 1989, and Minister for Northern and Regional Development for a brief time in 1989 until the Nationals were defeated in that year&#x27;s election.

Katter was a strong supporter of Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. In August 1989 he abruptly resigned from the cabinet of Bjelke-Petersen&#x27;s successor Mike Ahern, along with fellow cabinet ministers Russell Cooper and Paul Clauson. Their resignation was reportedly an attempt to force Ahern&#x27;s removal as party leader. Bjelke-Petersen subsequently endorsed Katter to succeed Ahern as leader and premier.

Katter returned to cabinet after only a month, following Cooper&#x27;s successful ouster of Ahern in September 1989. As mines minister, he was the subject of a no-confidence motion from the Queensland Chamber of Mines in November 1989, following his proposed changes to mining legislation that were perceived as favouring the interests of graziers over mining companies. His term as a minister ended following the government&#x27;s defeat at the 1989 state election.

==Federal politics (1993–present)==
===Nationals MP (1993–2001)===
Following his father&#x27;s retirement from federal parliament, Katter was an unsuccessful candidate for National Party preselection for the seat of Kennedy prior to the 1990 federal election.

Katter did not run for re-election to state Parliament in 1992. He ran as the National candidate in his father&#x27;s former seat of Kennedy at the 1993 federal election, facing his father&#x27;s successor, Labor&#x27;s Rob Hulls. Despite name recognition, Katter trailed Hulls for most of the night. On the eighth count, a Liberal candidate&#x27;s preferences flowed overwhelmingly to Katter, allowing him to defeat Hulls by 4,000 votes. He would not face another contest nearly that close for two decades.

In 1994, Katter advocated against the &quot;Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994&quot;, a federal law that bypassed Tasmania&#x27;s anti-gay laws, claiming the government was &quot;helping the spread of AIDS&quot; and legitimizing &quot;homosexual behavior&quot;. He also believed the laws jeopardized states&#x27; rights in Australia.

Katter was re-elected with a large swing in 1996, and was re-elected almost as easily in 1998. However, when he transferred to federal politics, he found himself increasingly out of sympathy with the federal Liberal and National parties on economic and social issues, with Katter being opposed to neoliberalism and social liberalism.

===Independent MP (2001–2011)===
In 2001, Katter resigned from the National Party and easily retained his seat as an independent at the general elections of 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010, each time ending up with a percentage vote in the high sixties after preferences were distributed.

In the aftermath of the 2010 hung federal election, Katter offered a range of views on the way forward for government. Two other former National Party MPs, both independents from rural electorates, Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott decided to support a Labor government. Katter presented his &quot;20 points&quot; document and asked the major parties to respond before deciding which party he would support. As a result, he broke with Windsor and Oakeshott and supported the Liberal/National Coalition for Government. On 7 September 2010, Katter announced his support for a Liberal/National Party coalition minority government.

===Katter&#x27;s Australian Party (2011–present)===
On 5 June 2011, Katter launched a new political party, Katter&#x27;s Australian Party, which he said would &quot;unashamedly represent agriculture&quot;. He made headlines after singing to his party&#x27;s candidates during a meeting on 17 October 2011, saying it was his &quot;election jingle&quot;.

In the 2013 election, however, Katter faced his first serious contest since his initial run for Kennedy in 1993. He had gone into the election holding the seat with a majority of 18 percent, making it the second-safest seat in Australia. However, reportedly due to anger at his decision to back Kevin Rudd (ALP) for Prime Minister following Julia Gillard&#x27;s (Prime Minister) live cattle export ban (Rudd, within weeks, reopened the live export market), Katter still suffered a primary-vote swing of over 17 points. His name heavily associated with Rudd. In the end, Katter was re-elected on Labor preferences, suffering a two-party swing of 16 points to the Liberal National party.

In the 2016 election, Katter retained his seat of Kennedy, with an increased swing of 8.93 points toward him.

On 15 August 2017 Katter announced that the Turnbull government could not take his support for granted in the wake of the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, which ensued over concerns that several MPs held dual citizenship and thus may be constitutionally ineligible to be in Parliament. Katter added that if one of the affected MPs, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, lost his seat, the Coalition could not count on his support for confidence and supply.

In November 2018, Katter secured funds for three inland dam-irrigation schemes in North Queensland.

In the 2019 election, Katter was returned to his seat of Kennedy with a swing of 2.9 points towards him, in spite of an unfavourable redistribution of his electorate. In the 2022 election, he was re-elected again, and became the Father of the Australian House of Representatives following the retirement of Kevin Andrews.

In July 2024 it was announced that a portrait of Katter may be commissioned and hung in the Federal Parliament.

==Political views==

Katter is an agrarian socialist and social conservative. Like his father, his views on economic matters echo 1950s &quot;Old Labor&quot; policy as it was before the 1955 DLP split. He opposes privatisation and economic deregulation and strongly supports traditional Country Party statutory marketing. In an interview in 1994, he cited his political heroes as ALP figures Jack Lang and Ted Theodore and U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt, but said Lang was ultimately a failure and he was &quot;aiming to be a John McEwen&quot;. The sobriquet &#x27;Mad Katter&#x27; was coined by his opponents to describe his nationalistic developmentalism.

As of 2020, Katter described himself as belonging to the &quot;hard left,&quot; citing his continuing membership of the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union. In a 2022 interview with &quot;The Chaser&quot;, Katter claimed that he had never pledged allegiance to the Queen of Australia when entering parliament.

===Abortion===
In 1980, Katter seconded a motion by Don Lane calling on the Queensland state government to &quot;protect the lives of unborn Queensland children being killed by abortion&quot;.

In 2006, Katter voted against a federal bill which would increase the availability of abortion drugs.

===Environment===
Katter has opposed enacting climate change legislation to control emissions. He advocates for measures that reduce carbon footprints. Katter has championed the mandating of ethanol fuel content. He has additionally pioneered protests against imported bananas, and is an opponent of the concentration of the Australian supermarket industry amongst Coles and Woolworths.

===Gun laws===
An opponent of the tougher gun control laws introduced in the wake of the 1996 massacre in Port Arthur, Tasmania, Katter was accused in 2001 of signing a petition promoted by the Citizens Electoral Council (CEC), an organisation that claims the Port Arthur massacre was a conspiracy. He has stated that he always and still believes there was no conspiracy.

===Immigration===
In 2017, Katter called for a &quot;Trump-like travel ban&quot; in Australia after a New South Welshman was arrested on terrorism charges. That same year, Katter repeated a pledge used by the far-right organisation &quot;Proud Boys&quot;, including that he was &quot;a proud western chauvinist&quot;. When asked about the incident when it was publicised in 2019, Katter distanced himself from the group, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know who this group is or anything about it&quot;.

===Indigenous Australians===
In 1987, as Queensland minister for Aboriginal and Islander affairs, Katter credited the state government with reducing Aboriginal deaths in custody by introducing &quot;new detention procedures to divert people arrested for minor offences away from traditional custody after a three-hour cooling off period&quot;. In 1989 he opposed installing condom vending machines in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to reduce the spread of AIDS, describing the plan instead as an attempt at eugenics, or &quot;racist genocide&quot;.

Katter is also an opponent of voter identification laws, denouncing the Coalition&#x27;s proposed introduction of them in 2021 as a racist system that would disenfranchise Aboriginal communities. In 2022, he announced that would not support an Indigenous Voice to Parliament proposal, but did believe that the indigenous people of Australia deserved a referendum on how they should be represented in parliament.

===North Queensland statehood===

Katter supports North Queensland statehood.

===LGBT rights===
In November 1989, Katter claimed there were almost no homosexuals in North Queensland. He promised to walk backwards from Bourke across his electorate if they represented more than 0.001 percent of the population. Katter also said &quot;mind you, if there are more, then I might take to walking backwards everywhere!&quot;&quot; Katter voted against the , which decriminalised homosexuality in Tasmania. He does not support same-sex marriage. His response to the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey result was the subject of international attention, as in response he declared that the issue of crocodiles killing people in North Queensland was more pressing than same-sex marriage. Therefore he declared that &quot;I ain&#x27;t spending any time on it!&quot; on the latter issue. In December 2017, Katter was one of only four members of the House of Representatives to oppose the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill 2017 legalising same-sex marriage in Australia.

==Personal life==
Katter occasionally identifies as being an Aboriginal Australian and has described himself as a blackfella in federal parliament, in interviews, during television appearances and at public events. Katter claims that in his youth he was accepted as a member of the Kalkadoon tribe in the Cloncurry area, otherwise known as the &quot;Curry mob&quot;, and said he has long since felt a deep connection with Aboriginal people.

His son Robbie has been a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly since 2012, representing Mount Isa from 2012 to 2017, and Traeger since 2017. He represents much of the territory that his father represented in state parliament.

Katter supports the North Queensland Cowboys in the National Rugby League (NRL).

<text>The Walla Walla River is a tributary of the Columbia River, joining the Columbia just above Wallula Gap in southeastern Washington in the United States. The river flows through Umatilla County, Oregon, and Walla Walla County, Washington. Its drainage basin is in area.

==Course==
The headwaters of the Walla Walla River lie in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon. The river originates as the North and South Forks of the Walla Walla River. The surrounding forested land holds a network of hiking and mountain-biking trails.

The confluence of the North and South Forks lies east of Milton–Freewater, Oregon. The river flows eastward to reach Milton–Freewater, which is built along its banks, and then flows northward through Milton–Freewater. Irrigation water is drawn from the river here and at numerous locations along the river.

The Walla Walla River flows southwest of the city of Walla Walla in the Walla Walla valley. Mill Creek, which flows through the city of Walla Walla, joins the Walla Walla River at the Whitman Mission west of the city of Walla Walla.

The Touchet River joins the Walla Walla at the town of Touchet, Washington. The annual mean discharge of the Walla Walla River just below the Touchet River confluence is . The maximum recorded discharge was in 1964.

The river enters the Columbia a mile south of the town of Wallula just north of Wallula Gap. The section of the Columbia River is called Wallula Lake, the reservoir impoundment created by McNary Dam.

==History==

The Walla Walla tribe occupied the region around the Walla Walla river prior to white settlers entry to the region.

The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806) was the first United States overland expedition to the Pacific coast and back—the return expedition stopped at the mouth of the Walla Walla and stayed with the Walla Walla tribe for a portion of the journey, proceeding from there overland to the Snake River. British explorer David Thompson was the first European to navigate the entire length of the Columbia River, to the Pacific Ocean, in 1811.

Fort Nez Percés (later known as Fort Walla Walla) was a fortified fur trading post on the Columbia River on the territory of modern-day Wallula, Washington. It was in operation from 1818 until 1857 on the eastern shore of the Columbia River, immediately north of the mouth of the Walla Walla River. The Oregon Treaty ended joint U.S.A. - British occupation that had been effect since the Treaty of 1818. The fort was abandoned in 1857 when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company gave up its Columbia District business in the Oregon Territory.

The Whitman Mission was established in 1836. It lies near the banks of the river to the west of the modern city of Walla Walla.

==Fish==
The Walla Walla River supports populations of spring Chinook salmon, summer steelhead, and bull trout among other species. There is a sport fishery for steelhead in the river.
It also holds channel catfish and smallmouth bass in the summer.

==Science==
Work done by Oregon and Washington State governments, federal and state environmental agencies and local watershed councils and groups on the Walla Walla River &amp; the overall catchment area has produced a wide range of studies. The Walla Walla Basin Watershed Council (WWBWC www.wwbwc.org) has both electronic and paper copies of many of these reports that date back to the 1930s. Considerable work has gone into the assessment of water quantity and quality for the purpose of salmon recovery and sustainable irrigation supply. A highly-connected alluvial groundwater system and its over-abstraction through over-allocated irrigation usage have also acted to influence flows and quality in the Walla Walla River.

The promise of the Walla Walla River lies in its integrated water-management strategy using Managed Aquifer Recharge (Or Shallow Aquifer Recharge) to utilise available non-irrigation season water to replenish groundwater supplies and the over-allocation of groundwater resources by both state governments. The Walla Walla partnership along with the WWBWC set a national example with this innovative and low-cost alternative to surface storage using dams.

<text>De-Anne Margaret Kelly (née Park; born 21 March 1954) is an Australian former politician.

Kelly was a National Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1996 until November 2007, representing the Division of Dawson, Queensland.

She was the first female member of the National Party to win a seat in the House of Representatives.

==Personal life==
Kelly was born in Rockhampton, Queensland to parents Ian Park and Margaret Park (née Bauman). Kelly&#x27;s uncle was Kerrod Park, who was known for his involvement with local government in Queensland, having served as the chairman of Duaringa Shire Council from 1973 to 1994.

Kelly grew up on a cattle property where she obtained her primary education from her mother who taught her at the kitchen table. She then attended high school in Rockhampton and after winning a scholarship to study electrical engineering, Kelly attended the University of Queensland.

After graduating, Kelly worked as an engineer before she bought a small manufacturing business with her husband. Seven years later, she and her husband purchased a cattle property near Dingo where they lived in a shed with their infant son.

In 2004, she and her husband owned and operated a sugar cane farm at Mirani, near Mackay.

==Parliamentary career==
In her first parliamentary speech, Kelly paid tribute to her late father Ian Park who she commended for having a &quot;girls can do anything&quot; attitude. She also said she owed her character and convictions to her father. In her speech, Kelly also said she drew inspiration from Lady Florence Bjelke-Petersen who had taught her some &quot;valuable lessons&quot;.

Kelly was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade between October 2003 and October 2004, at which time she was appointed Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs. She gained the additional position of Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence in November 2004, but was demoted to Parliamentary Secretary (Trade) in January 2006. Kelly served in this position until September 2006, when she was reappointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.
At the 2007 general election, Kelly was unseated by Labor candidate and City of Mackay councillor James Bidgood. Kelly went into the election sitting on a majority of over 10 percent. However, as part of the Labor wave that swept through Queensland in that election, Bidgood defeated her on a swing of more than 13 per cent. Kelly&#x27;s defeat came as a surprise to most commentators; due to her large majority, there was no hint she was in any danger.

<doc id="571235" wikidata="Q11790893" url="?curid=571235" title="New York Point">
<text>New York Point (New York Point: ) is a braille-like system of tactile writing for the blind invented by William Bell Wait (1839–1916), a teacher in the New York Institute for the Education of the Blind. The system used one to four pairs of points set side by side, each containing one or two dots. (Letters of one through four pairs, each with two dots, would be .) The most common letters are written with the fewest points, a strategy also employed by the competing American Braille.

Capital letters were cumbersome in New York Point, each being four dots wide, and so were not generally used. Likewise, the four-dot-wide hyphen and apostrophe were generally omitted. When capitals, hyphens, or apostrophes were used, they sometimes caused legibility problems, and a separate capital sign was never agreed upon. According to Helen Keller, this caused literacy problems among blind children, and was one of the chief arguments against New York Point and in favor of one of the braille alphabets.

New York Point competed with the American Braille alphabet, which consisted of fixed cells two points wide and three high. Books written in embossed alphabets like braille are quite bulky, and New York Point&#x27;s system of two horizontal lines of dots was an advantage over the three lines required for braille; the principle of writing the most common letters with the fewest dots was likewise an advantage of New York Point and American Braille over English Braille.

Wait advocated the New York System as more logical than either the American Braille or the English Braille alphabets, and the three scripts competed in what was known as the &quot;War of the Dots&quot;. Around 1916, agreement settled on English Braille standardized to French Braille letter order, chiefly because of the superior punctuation compared with New York Point, the speed of reading braille, the large amount of written material available in English Braille compared with American Braille, and the international accessibility offered by following French alphabetical order.

Wait also invented the &quot;Kleidograph&quot;, a typewriter with twelve keys for embossing New York Point on paper, and the &quot;Stereograph&quot;, for creating metal plates to be used in printing.

==Alphabet==
New York Point is not supported by Unicode, as of version 14.0. Like braille, there are contractions: single letters in New York Point that correspond to sequences of letters in print.

New York Point is read from left to right. A symbol consists of one to four consecutive cells that are each two points high and one point wide. Capital letters all consist of four cells. Each capital letter is derived from the corresponding lower-case letter by adding at the end a horizontal line consisting of as many points as are needed for the capital letter to be four points wide (i.e. a line of three points to a lower-case letter that is one cell wide, a line of two points to a lower-case letter that is two points wide, and one point to a lower-case letter that is three points wide). The points are added in the lower halves of the cells if the final cell of the lower-case letter only has a point in the upper half; otherwise, the points are added in the upper halves of the cells.

==Punctuation==
Like in braille, there is a number sign that converts letters to digits. The ten digits are the same four-dot patterns found in braille, but with entirely different values:

The only punctuation marks three-dots wide are the number sign above and the quotation mark, which has the same form as the letter &quot;q&quot;. The dash, hyphen, and apostrophe are four dots wide.

==Musical notation==

Notes are made by combining two &#x27;primitives&#x27;, which are the digits 1–7:
 is thus a whole C note, a quarter D note, etc. In chords, the length is only given for the first note mentioned.

These may be prefixed by ♯, ♭, or ♮, and suffixed by dot (length × 1½). These may be doubled, as in print. 

The note is preceded by its octave, which is written as the number plus an upper dot: 5th 8va, 2nd 8va, etc.

Rests are two lower dots plus the length: a whole rest, a half rest, etc.

Chords are written as intervals, which is the number plus a lower dot: is a third, etc. The sign signals a change in octave. Thus a chord of three notes spanning the 4th to 5th octaves is
:4th-8va C-whole 5th-inv&#x27;l with 5th-8va E

See Wait&#x27;s publications for additional conventions.

<text>Jacqueline Marie Kelly (born 18 February 1964) is an Australian former politician who served as a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1996 until November 2007, representing the Division of Lindsay, New South Wales.

==Early career==
Kelly was born in Upper Hutt, New Zealand, and attended the Monte Sant&#x27; Angelo Mercy College, in North Sydney. She obtained a law degree from the University of Queensland, where she also attained a &#x27;full blue&#x27; for rowing, and later represented Australia in the sport.

In 1987, she commenced work with the Corrective Services Department of Queensland and worked as a probation and parole officer. In May 1989, she was admitted to practice as a barrister of the Supreme Court of Queensland. From 1989 to 1996, she was a legal officer (Squadron Leader) with the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and in June 1995, she was awarded the Helsham prize for her services to the RAAF Legal Department.

==Political career==
===Federal politics===
At the 1996 federal election, Kelly was elected to the Australian parliament for the seat of Lindsay, based around the suburb of Penrith, on the western fringe of Sydney. However, her election was invalidated six months later on 11 September 1996 because her employment by the RAAF contravened Section 44 (iv) of the Australian Constitution, which disqualifies from election those who hold an office of profit under the Crown. As well, she still held New Zealand citizenship, in contravention of Section 44 (i).

After resigning from the RAAF and renouncing her New Zealand citizenship, she was re-elected at the 1996 Lindsay by-election with an increased majority. At the 1998 federal election, which was largely a referendum on the proposal by Liberal-National Coalition government for a goods and services tax, she was re-elected with a slim majority, but she increased her majority at the 2001 federal election and maintained that margin at the 2004 election.

Kelly was the Minister for Sport and Tourism from October 1998 to November 2001, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games from October 1998 to January 2001, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister from November 2001 to October 2004.

In 1999, Kelly hosted the International Drugs in Sport Summit, which dealt with the doping problem ahead of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Although the first sitting Australian federal parliamentarian to give birth to a child was Ros Kelly in 1983, in 2000 Kelly became the first serving Australian federal minister to give birth to a child (a daughter named Dominique).

In 2001, Kelly was attacked by the Transport Workers Union for describing the collapse of Ansett Airlines as being &quot;about getting over a little blip and getting back into the very, very bright future that is ahead for tourism&quot;. When she was the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister (for the Office of the Status of Women), Kelly was instrumental in the development and implementation of the &#x27;Baby Bonus&#x27; scheme, introduced in 2002.

In 2006, she was paired with Pavel Aubrecht when she competed on &quot;Torvill and Dean&#x27;s Dancing on Ice&quot; and was eliminated third.

In May 2007, Kelly announced her intention to retire from federal politics at the election to be held later that year.

=== Pamphlet scandal ===
On 21 November 2007, three days before the federal election, an anonymous member of the Liberal Party contacted the assistant secretary of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), Luke Foley, with information that Liberal Party members would be distributing a flyer to letterboxes throughout the suburb of St Marys, linking the ALP with a fictional Islamic organisation. (Due to a redistribution of electoral boundaries, St Marys had been moved from the safe Labor seat of Chifley into Kelly&#x27;s seat of Lindsay.) Kelly&#x27;s husband, Gary Clark, and four other people, were caught when they were about to letter-box the pamphlets, which thanked the ALP for supporting Muslim terrorists. Two Liberal Party members (including Jeff Egan, and the husband of the Liberal candidate for Lindsay Greg Chijoff) were forced to resign from the party.

Having already retired, Kelly categorically denied any knowledge of the pamphlets prior to their distribution. When confronted by media at her children&#x27;s school drop-off the following morning, she stated: &quot;My view is that it is a bit of a Chaser-style prank&quot;, referring to the time the satirical TV program, &quot;The Chaser&quot;, had done a stunt in Mosman that involved claiming a mosque was to be built in the neighbourhood, and asking for comments from people on the street.

===State politics===
In February 2014, Kelly unsuccessfully contested the Liberal pre-selection for the seat of Penrith in the NSW parliament, held by Liberal Stuart Ayres. In October 2014, she resigned her Liberal Party membership, stating: &quot;There&#x27;s no local voice in the Liberal Party, there&#x27;s no reason to be a member because the lobbyists are running the party&quot;, and also blaming the performance of the party&#x27;s State Executive.

Kelly then contested Penrith at the 2015 New South Wales state election as an independent but was unsuccessful against Liberal incumbent Ayres. She did, however, direct preferences to the ALP&#x27;s candidate Emma Husar. That contributed to a significant swing away from Ayres on a two-party preferred basis. Husar later won Kelly&#x27;s old federal seat of Lindsay in 2016 and held it for one term.

== Other ==
=== Sporting achievements ===
Kelly was part of Australia&#x27;s elite rowing program. She was in line for selection for the Australian rowing team to the Seoul Olympics in 1988, but Rowing Australia opted not to send a women&#x27;s team. In 1986, Kelly represented Australia in the under 23s rowing, in scull and double scull, as well as the Nationals. She competed in the 1994 World Masters rowing in Brisbane, winning 2 gold, 1 silver and 2 bronze medals, the 1997 Australian Masters Rowing Championships in Canberra, winning 1 gold and 1 bronze, and the 1997 World Masters Rowing Championships in Adelaide, winning 2 gold.

=== Personal life ===
Kelly married Gary Clark, a local orthodontist, on 5 December 1998. They have two children, Dominique and Lachlan.

<doc id="571244" wikidata="Q2822847" url="?curid=571244" title="British Empire Economic Conference">
<text>The British Empire Economic Conference (also known as the Imperial Economic Conference or Ottawa Conference) was a 1932 conference of British colonies and dominions held to discuss the Great Depression. It was held between 21 July and 20 August in Ottawa.

The conference saw the group admit the failure of the gold standard and abandon attempts to return to it. The meeting also worked to establish a zone of limited tariffs within the British Empire, but with high tariffs with the rest of the world. This was called &quot;Imperial preference&quot; or &quot;Empire Free-Trade&quot; on the principle of &quot;home producers first, empire producers second, and foreign producers last&quot;. The result of the conference was a series of bilateral agreements that would last for at least 5 years. This abandonment of open free trade led to a split in the British National Government coalition: the Official Liberals under Herbert Samuel left the Government, but the National Liberals under Sir John Simon remained.

The conference was especially notable for its adoption of Keynesian ideas such as lowering interest rates, increasing the money supply, and expanding government spending.

According to a 2024 study, the impact of the agreement on Canada was limited, as Canada already had a highly protectionist trade policy.

==Heads of delegations==

The conference was hosted by the Governor General of Canada, The Earl of Bessborough, representing King George V and included the Prime Ministers and other leaders of the Empire and members of their respective cabinets:

<text>A Streaker is a type of sailing dinghy designed in 1975 by Jack Holt. It is a light (minimum weight only 48 kg) one-person boat with a uni-rig stayed sail plan. It is sailed mainly in Britain and the Philippines, and over 2200 have been built. At first all boats were built of plywood, but since 1998 fibreglass, and fibreglass variants have been used, and now over half of new boats are of fibreglass or composite (fibreglass and wood) construction.

The hull design is a double chine hull, with little freeboard. The boat incorporates an unconventional raking daggerboard. Recent developments have included a smaller sail, known as the &#x27;Wave Sail&#x27; for use by lighter crews or in strong winds.

<doc id="571250" wikidata="Q3236763" url="?curid=571250" title="Chandni Chowk">
<text>The Chandni Chowk (meaning Moonlight Square) is one of the oldest and busiest markets in Old Delhi, India. Located close to the Old Delhi railway station, the Mughal-era Red Fort is located at the eastern fringes of Chandni Chowk. It was built in 1650 by the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, and designed by his daughter, Jahanara. The street spanning the market was historically divided by canals, engineered to reflect moonlight. These canals have since been closed, leaving behind a transformed urban landscape. It remains one of India&#x27;s largest wholesale markets.

== History ==
The market&#x27;s history dates to the founding of the capital city of Shahjahanabad when Emperor Shah Jahan established the Red Fort on the banks of the Yamuna River, hemming his new capital.

===Original Chandni Chowk===

The original Chandni Chowk, half-moon-shaped square, was situated before the Townhall; its reflection used to shimmer in the moonlit water pool located at the front. A shallow water channel, whose source was the Yamuna, ran through the middle of the straight street now referred to as the Chandni Chowk bazaar, with roads and shops on either side of the channel. This road had three bazaars. Chandni Chowk (&quot;moonlight square&quot;) and its three bazaars were designed and established by Princess Jahanara Begum, Shah Jahan&#x27;s favourite daughter, in 1650. Originally consisting of 1,560 shops, the bazaar was 40 yards wide and 1,520 yards long. The bazaar, fashion to resemble a square, was accorded ample elegance by the presence of a pool at the complex&#x27;s center. The pool glimmered under the moonlight, a characteristic that inspired its name. The shops were originally arranged in a distinctive half-moon pattern, a design that has since been lost or altered over time. The bazaar gained renown for its thriving silver trade, leading to its association with silver merchants. This prominence earned it the moniker Silver Street—a name rooted in its Hindi counterpart, wherein silver is called &quot;Chandi&quot;. The term &quot;Chandni&quot;, which is closely derived from &quot;Chandi&quot;, further emphasizes the cultural and linguistic connection to the bazaar&#x27;s identity. 

The pool at the square was replaced by a clock tower (Ghantaghar) in the 1870s. The centre of the market is still referred to as Ghantaghar. Chandni Chowk was once the grandest Indian market. Chandni Chowk was a significant route for Mughal imperial processions, hosting the grand displays of emperors and their entourages, highlighting its importance in the empire&#x27;s cultural and architectural heritage. The tradition of grand processions through Chandni Chowk continued during the Delhi Durbar of 1903. Meanwhile, the British contributed to the area&#x27;s architectural heritage by constructing the Delhi Town Hall in 1863.

===Original three bazaars===
The term &quot;Chandni Chowk&quot; previously referred only to the square that hosted the reflecting pool. Today, the entirety of the stretch that runs spans the middle of the walled city, from Lahori Gate of the Red Fort to the Fatehpuri Masjid, is known as Chandni Chowk. The road was subsequently trifurcated into the following bazaars:

* Urdu Bazar: the stretch spanning from Lahori Gate of Red Fort to &quot;Chowk Kotwali&quot; near Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib was called Urdu Bazaar, i.e., the encampment market. The Urdu language received its name from this encampment. Ghalib noted the destruction of this market during the disturbances of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and its aftermath.
* Johri Bazar: the &quot;Chowk Kotwali&quot; to &quot;Chandni Chowk&quot; section of the straight road was originally called &quot;Johri Bazar&quot;.
* Fatehpuri Bazar: &quot;Chandni Chowk&quot; to Fatehpuri Masjid section of the straight road was originally called the Fatehpuri Bazar.

While the contemporary market is blighted with congestion, the market still retains its historical character.

=== Kucha, katra and havelis ===
The road now called Chandni Chowk had several streets branching off of it, which were referred to as &quot;kuchas&quot; (streets/wings). Each &quot;kucha&quot; usually had several &quot;katras&quot; (cul de sac or guild houses), which in turn had several havelis. The following terms are generally used to describe the buildings and the streets:

* Mohalla (neighborhood): a residential neighbourhood with &quot;kuchas&quot; and &quot;katras&quot; within &quot;kuchas&quot;.
* Kucha or &quot;Gali&quot; (street): Kucha in the Persian language is synonymous with &quot;Gali&quot; or street in the Hindi language. It is a street or a zone with houses whose owners shared some common attributes, usually their occupation. Hence the names &quot;Kucha Maliwara&quot; (the gardeners&#x27; street) and &quot;Kucha Ballimaran&quot; (the oarsmen&#x27;s street). Kuchas either had rows of large Havelis or gated cul de sac (dead end) &quot;Katra&quot; marketplaces along with them.
* Kucha mahajani: is one of the biggest gold-trading hubs and wholesale jewellery markets in Asia.
* Katra (gated cul-de-sac courtyard market-cum-residential complex in a street): are one-room quarters around a court with a single narrow entrance and inhabited by people of the same caste or occupation i.e. a zone with houses whose owners shared some common attribute, usually their occupation, hence the name. Katra refers to a separate wing of tradesmen and craftsmen belonging to the same trade. They usually lived and worked together in a gated cul de sac, the doors of which could be closed at night for the protection of the merchandise, equipment, workers and their families. It is a system similar to the guild housing in Amsterdam such as Handboogdoelen and Voetboogdoelen.
* Haveli (mansion): A normal haveli has a big courtyard (atrium) surrounded on four sides by spacious rooms and often another walled courtyard around the exterior. Historic havelis include:
** Begum Samru&#x27;s palace built in 1806, now called Bhagirath Palace, see.
** Dharampura Haveli, Gali Guliyan, designed in late Mughal style although parts show the influence of 20 Century architecture. During Mughal and late Mughal Period, a large numbers of Havelis were built by courtiers. With increasing interest in Old Delhi by tourists, and to revive the old world charm of Purani Dilli, Haveli Dharmpura houses an Indian restaurant serving specialities of Mughal era with a contemporary touch, which you can enjoy with classical dance.
** Chunnamal haveli in Katra Neel
** Ghalib ki Haveli of Mirza Ghalib, Gali Qasim Jan (Gali Ballimaran)
** Haksar Haveli in Sita Ram Bazar, where Jawaharlal Nehru was married on 8 February 1916 to Kamla Nehru. She was born here, and her family sold it in the 1960s. Haveli used to host mushairas
** Haveli Banarsi Bhawan with a water well is situated near to Shree Digambar Meru Jain Temple in the Masjid Khajoor area.
** Haveli Naharwali, Kucha Sadullah Khan, where Pervez Musharraf, former president of Pakistan was born and his grandfather sold it to Prem Chand Gola after whom this area is now called Gola Market. This was originally owned by the Raja Nahar Khan a Hindu convert of Mewat who converted to Islam during the era of Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1355, hence the name.
**Khazanchi haveli, the Khajanchi were the accountants of Shah Jahan. A street is named after them called &quot;Gali Khajanchi&quot;, a long tunnel connects the haveli and the Red Fort, so that money could be transferred safely. It is close to the entrance of Chandni Chowk, from the Red Fort walk towards Fatehpuri, turn left on road to Dariba and the haveli is at the end of the road that connects Dariba and Esplanade Road.
** Haveli Raja Jugal Kishore, a grand mansion with an imposing gate, which was adorned with a large ghanta-bell. Located adjacent to the gate, a room in the haveli opening towards the street, was given to Lala Sukhlal by the owners of the haveli as a philanthropic gesture to open a sweet shop, which came to be identified as ghante ke neechewala halwaii. (see Ghantewala). A street is named after the haveli; Kucha-i-Haveli Raja Jugal Kishore between Kucha Maliwara and Kotwali Chabutra.
**Naughara Mansions in Naughara Gali off Kinari Bazaar has 18th century Jain mansions. It is a street with nine (nau) continuous havelies with brightly painted floral designs on the facade. Each of the havelies used to have a gharha (water pot) placed at door for the thirsty passersby. There is a white marble Jain Svetambara Temple at the end of the street with stone elephant heads at the door, intricate carvings on walls and pillars, a museum on the ground floor with rare manuscripts embroidered in pure gold and silver threads and a black image of Lord Parasanath in the rare kasauti stone on the first floor. Office of Atma Prakash Aggrawal at the beginning of the street houses numerous antiques and should not be mistaken as an antique shop.
** Zeenat Mahal Haveli, Lal Kuan Bazar

Some other commonly used terms are &quot;Chatta&quot; (the upper floor which arches over the street below), &quot;phatak&quot; (door, usually to a katra or street which could be locked at night), &quot;mahal&quot; (a palace, as in Taj Mahal), &quot;kamra&quot; (a room), &quot;kuan&quot; is waterwell, etc.

=== Historic religious buildings ===
Delhi&#x27;s most famous mosque, Jama Masjid, built-in 1650 in the vicinity, is near other religious shrines, belonging to multiple religions. Starting from the Red Fort, the buildings include:

* The Sri Digambar Jain Lal Mandir, established in 1656 with a bird hospital established in 1929. A Naya Mandir was built in 1807 in Dharampura, as the first temple with a Shikhar.
* The Gauri Shankar Temple was built by a Maratha general Appa Gangadhar according to one of the legends.
* The Central Baptist Church, it was built-in 1814.
* The Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib. The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur and his followers Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Dyal Das and Bhai Sati Das were executed nearby by the Mughals in 1675. The Gurudwaras in the form of memorials were built in 1783 after Delhi, the then Mughal capital was captured by the Khalsa (the corporate body of Sikhs) under the command of Baghel Singh. Present Building was however built later in 1930.
* The Sunehri Masjid was built in 1721 by Roshan-Ud-Daula Zafar Khan in the reign of Mohammad Shah. Persian invader Nader Shah spent several hours on the top of the mosque on 11 March 1739 to observe the Katl-e-Aam (the killing of everyone in sight) that he had ordered, which resulted in 30,000 deaths.
* The Fatehpuri Masjid was built by Fatehpuri Begum in 1650, one of the queens of Shah Jahan.

== Present ==
On both sides of the wide Chandni Chowk are historical residential areas served by narrow lanes (&quot;gali&quot;), several of which are teeming with the peddlers, street vendors, street food and bazaars.

Chandni Chowk&#x27;s speciality is its variety and authenticity: food, delicacies and sweets of more than 1,000 kinds, sarees with chikan and zari. Narrow lanes host shops that sell books, clothing, electronics, consumer goods, shoes and leather goods. It is the location of the original Haldiram&#x27;s and brands such as Giani&#x27;s.

== Redevelopment ==

Chandni Chowk was redeveloped as heritage trail to stimulate tourism, seeking inspiration from the inception of the Heritage Street in Amritsar. The Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation, under the auspices of the Government of Delhi, is the agency entrusted with this ambitious task. The redevelopment plan includes the incorporation of walkways to render the area more pedestrian-friendly. No motorized traffic will be allowed to ply on Chandni Chowk from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid during daylight hours. Certain streets will be barricaded. The redevelopment plan was supposed to have been completed before the inauguration of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but got delayed. The plan also envisions parking space for 1500 cars.

As a part of the redevelopment, the construction of a multilevel parking-cum-commercial complex is underway at Gandhi Maidan in Chandni Chowk. 

This multilevel parking-cum-commercial complex, an eight-story building with three basements spanning 18,524 square meters, is being developed at a cost of ₹1,000 crore under a PPP model in collaboration with a real estate developer. The project will have the capacity to accommodate over 2,300 cars.

<text>Minimal music (also called minimalism) is a form of art music or other compositional practice that employs limited or minimal musical materials. Prominent features of minimalist music include repetitive patterns or pulses, steady drones, consonant harmony, and reiteration of musical phrases or smaller units. It may include features such as phase shifting, resulting in what is termed phase music, or process techniques that follow strict rules, usually described as process music. The approach is marked by a non-narrative, non-teleological, and non-representational approach, and calls attention to the activity of listening by focusing on the internal processes of the music.

The approach originated on the West Coast of the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly around the Bay Area, where La Monte Young, Terry Riley and Steve Reich were studying and living at the time. After the three composers moved to the East Coast, their music became associated with the New York Downtown scene of the mid-1960s, where it was initially viewed as a form of experimental music called the &quot;New York Hypnotic School.&quot; In the Western art music tradition, the American composers Moondog, La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass are credited with being among the first to develop compositional techniques that exploit a minimal approach. The movement originally involved dozens of composers, although only five (Young, Riley, Reich, Glass, and later John Adams) emerged to become publicly associated with American minimal music; other lesser known pioneers included Dennis Johnson, Terry Jennings, Richard Maxfield, Pauline Oliveros, Phill Niblock, and James Tenney. In Europe, the music of Louis Andriessen, Karel Goeyvaerts, Michael Nyman, Howard Skempton, Éliane Radigue, Gavin Bryars, Steve Martland, Peter Michael Hamel, Henryk Górecki, Arvo Pärt and John Tavener exhibits minimalist traits.

It is unclear where the term &quot;minimal music&quot; originates. Steve Reich has suggested that it is attributable to Michael Nyman, an assertion that two scholars, Jonathan Bernard, and Dan Warburton, have also made in writing. Philip Glass believes Tom Johnson coined the phrase.

==Brief history==
The word &quot;minimal&quot; was perhaps first used in relation to music in 1968 by Michael Nyman, who &quot;deduced a recipe for the successful &#x27;minimal-music&#x27; happening from the entertainment presented by Charlotte Moorman and Nam June Paik at the ICA&quot;, which included a performance of &quot;Springen&quot; by Henning Christiansen and a number of unidentified performance-art pieces. Nyman later expanded his definition of minimal music in his 1974 book &quot;Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond&quot;. Tom Johnson, one of the few composers to self-identify as minimalist, also claims to have been first to use the word as new music critic for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. He describes &quot;minimalism&quot;:

The idea of minimalism is much larger than many people realize. It includes, by definition, any music that works with limited or minimal materials: pieces that use only a few notes, pieces that use only a few words of text, or pieces written for very limited instruments, such as antique cymbals, bicycle wheels, or whiskey glasses. It includes pieces that sustain one basic electronic rumble for a long time. It includes pieces made exclusively from recordings of rivers and streams. It includes pieces that move in endless circles. It includes pieces that set up an unmoving wall of saxophone sound. It includes pieces that take a very long time to move gradually from one kind of music to another kind. It includes pieces that permit all possible pitches, as long as they fall between C and D. It includes pieces that slow the tempo down to two or three notes per minute.

Already in 1965 the art historian Barbara Rose had named La Monte Young&#x27;s &quot;Dream Music&quot;, Morton Feldman&#x27;s characteristically soft dynamics, and various unnamed composers &quot;all, to a greater or lesser degree, indebted to John Cage&quot; as examples of &quot;minimal art&quot;, but did not specifically use the expression &quot;minimal music&quot;.

The most prominent minimalist composers are La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, John Adams, and Louis Andriessen. Others who have been associated with this compositional approach include Terry Jennings, Gavin Bryars, Tom Johnson, Michael Nyman, Michael Parsons, Howard Skempton, Dave Smith, James Tenney, and John White. Among African-American composers, the minimalist aesthetic was embraced by figures such as jazz musician John Lewis and multidisciplinary artist Julius Eastman.

The early compositions of Glass and Reich are somewhat austere, with little embellishment on the principal theme. These are works for small instrumental ensembles, of which the composers were often members. In Glass&#x27;s case, these ensembles comprise organs, winds—particularly saxophones—and vocalists, while Reich&#x27;s works have more emphasis on mallet and percussion instruments. Most of Adams&#x27;s works are written for more traditional European classical music instrumentation, including full orchestra, string quartet, and solo piano.

The music of Reich and Glass drew early sponsorship from art galleries and museums, presented in conjunction with visual-art minimalists like Robert Morris (in Glass&#x27;s case), and Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman, and the filmmaker Michael Snow (as performers, in Reich&#x27;s case).

==Early development==
The music of Moondog of the 1940s and &#x27;50s, which was based on counterpoint developing statically over steady pulses in often unusual time signatures influenced both Philip Glass and Steve Reich. Glass has written that he and Reich took Moondog&#x27;s work &quot;very seriously and understood and appreciated it much more than what we were exposed to at Juilliard&quot;.

La Monte Young&#x27;s 1958 composition &quot;Trio for Strings&quot; consists almost entirely of long tones and rests. It has been described as an origin point for minimalist music.

One of the first minimalist compositions was &quot;November&quot; by Dennis Johnson, written in 1959. A work for solo piano that lasted around six hours, it demonstrated many features that would come to be associated with minimalism, such as diatonic tonality, phrase repetition, additive process, and duration. La Monte Young credits this piece as the inspiration for his own magnum opus, &quot;The Well-Tuned Piano.&quot;

In 1960, Terry Riley wrote a string quartet in pure, uninflected C major. In the early 1960s, Riley made two electronic works using tape delay, &quot;Mescalin Mix&quot; (1960-1962) and &quot;The Gift&quot; (1963), which injected the idea of repetition into minimalism. In 1964, Riley&#x27;s &quot;In C&quot; made persuasively engaging textures from the layered performance of repeated melodic phrases. The work is scored for any group of instruments and/or voices. Keith Potter writes &quot;its fifty-three modules notated on a single page, this work has frequently been viewed as the beginning of musical minimalism.&quot; Inspired by his work with Terry Riley on the premiere of &quot;In C&quot;, Steve Reich produced three works—&quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot; and &quot;Come Out&quot; for tape, and &quot;Piano Phase&quot; for live performers—that introduced the idea of phase shifting, or allowing two identical phrases or sound samples played at slightly different speeds to repeat and slowly go out of phase with each other. Starting in 1968 with &quot;1 + 1&quot;, Philip Glass wrote a series of works that incorporated additive process (form based on sequences such as 1, 1 2, 1 2 3, 1 2 3 4) into the repertoire of minimalist techniques; these works included &quot;Two Pages&quot;, &quot;Music in Fifths&quot;, &quot;Music in Contrary Motion&quot;, and others. Glass was influenced by Ravi Shankar and Indian music from the time he was assigned a film score transcription of music by Ravi Shankar into western notation. He realized that in the West time is divided like a &quot;slice of bread&quot;; Indians and other cultures take small units and string them together.

==Style==
According to Richard E. Rodda, Minimalist&#x27; music is based upon the repetition of slowly changing common chords [chords that are diatonic to more than one key, or else triads, either just major, or major and minor—see: common tone] in steady rhythms, often overlaid with a lyrical melody in long, arching phrases...[It] utilizes repetitive melodic patterns, consonant harmonies, motoric rhythms, and a deliberate striving for aural beauty.&quot; Timothy Johnson holds that, as a style, minimal music is primarily continuous in form, without disjunct sections. A direct consequence of this is an uninterrupted texture made up of interlocking rhythmic patterns and pulses. It is in addition marked by the use of bright timbres and an energetic manner. Its harmonic sonorities are distinctively simple, usually diatonic, often consist of familiar triads and seventh chords, and are presented in a slow harmonic rhythm. Johnson disagrees with Rodda, however, in finding that minimal music&#x27;s most distinctive feature is the complete absence of extended melodic lines. Instead, there are only brief melodic segments, thrusting the organization, combination, and individual characteristics of short, repetitive rhythmic patterns into the foreground.

Leonard B. Meyer described minimal music in 1994:
Because there is little sense of goal-directed motion, [minimal] music does not seem to move from one place to another. Within any musical segment, there may be some sense of direction, but frequently the segments fail to lead to or imply one another. They simply follow one another.
As Kyle Gann puts it, the tonality used in minimal music lacks &quot;goal-oriented European association[s]&quot;.

David Cope lists the following qualities as possible characteristics of minimal music:
* Silence
* Concept music
* Brevity
* Continuities: requiring slow modulation of one or more parameters [implying length]
* Phase and pattern music, including repetition [implying length]

Famous pieces that use this technique are the &quot;number&quot; section of Glass&#x27; &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, Reich&#x27;s tape-loop pieces &quot;Come Out&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot;, and Adams&#x27; &quot;Shaker Loops&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Robert Fink offers a summary of some notable critical reactions to minimal music: 

Elliott Carter maintained a consistent critical stance against minimalism and in 1982 he went so far as to compare it to fascism in stating that &quot;one also hears constant repetition in the speeches of Hitler and in advertising. It has its dangerous aspects.&quot; When asked in 2001 how he felt about minimal music he replied that &quot;we are surrounded by a world of minimalism. All that junk mail I get every single day repeats; when I look at television I see the same advertisement, and I try to follow the movie that&#x27;s being shown, but I&#x27;m being told about cat food every five minutes. That is minimalism.&quot; Fink notes that Carter&#x27;s general loathing of the music is representative of a form of musical snobbery that dismisses repetition more generally. Carter has even criticised the use of repetition in the music of Edgard Varèse and Charles Ives, stating that &quot;I cannot understand the popularity of that kind of music, which is based on repetition. In a civilized society, things don&#x27;t need to be said more than three times.&quot;

Ian MacDonald claimed that minimalism is the &quot;passionless, sexless and emotionally blank soundtrack of the Machine Age, its utopian selfishness no more than an expression of human passivity in the face of mass-production and The Bomb&quot;.

Steve Reich has argued that such criticism is misplaced. In 1987 he stated that his compositional output reflected the popular culture of postwar American consumer society because the &quot;elite European-style serial music&quot; was simply not representative of his cultural experience. Reich stated that 

Kyle Gann, himself a minimalist composer, has argued that minimalism represented a predictable return to simplicity after the development of an earlier style had run its course to extreme and unsurpassable complexity. Parallels include the advent of the simple Baroque continuo style following elaborate Renaissance polyphony and the simple early classical symphony following Bach&#x27;s monumental advances in Baroque counterpoint. In addition, critics have often overstated the simplicity of even early minimalism. Michael Nyman has pointed out that much of the charm of Steve Reich&#x27;s early music had to do with perceptual phenomena that were not actually played, but resulted from subtleties in the phase-shifting process. In other words, the music often does not sound as simple as it looks.

In Gann&#x27;s further analysis, during the 1980s minimalism evolved into less strict, more complex styles such as postminimalism and totalism, breaking out of the strongly framed repetition and stasis of early minimalism, and enriching it with a confluence of other rhythmic and structural influences.

==In popular music==

Minimal music has had some influence on developments in popular music. The experimental rock act The Velvet Underground had a connection with the New York down-town scene from which minimal music emerged, rooted in the close working relationship of John Cale and La Monte Young, the latter influencing Cale&#x27;s work with the band. Terry Riley&#x27;s album &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot; (1969) was released during the era of psychedelia and flower power, becoming the first minimalist work to have crossover success, appealing to rock and jazz audiences. Music theorist Daniel Harrison coined the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; (1967) an experimental work of &quot;protominimal rock&quot;, elaborating: &quot;[The album] can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition.&quot; The development of specific experimental rock genres such as krautrock, space rock (from the 1980s), noise rock, and post-rock was influenced by minimal music.

Philip Sherburne has suggested that noted similarities between minimal forms of electronic dance music and American minimal music could easily be accidental. Much of the music technology used in dance music has traditionally been designed to suit loop-based compositional methods, which may explain why certain stylistic features of styles such as minimal techno sound similar to minimal art music. One group who clearly did have an awareness of the American minimal tradition is the British ambient act The Orb. Their 1990 production &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; features a sample from Steve Reich&#x27;s work &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot; (1987). Further acknowledgement of Steve Reich&#x27;s possible influence on electronic dance music came with the release in 1999 of the &quot;Reich Remixed&quot; tribute album which featured reinterpretations by artists such as DJ Spooky, Mantronik, Ken Ishii, and Coldcut, among others.
