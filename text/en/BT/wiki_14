<text>Josiah Cleaveland Cady (January 1837 – April 17, 1919) was an American architect known for his Romanesque Revival designs. He was also a founder of the American Institute of Architects.

Cady started his career as a draftsman for Town &amp; Davis in New York City. He opened his Manhattan practice, J. Cleaveland Cady, Architect, in 1864. The firm became J. C. Cady &amp; Company in 1882 and Cady, Berg &amp; See in 1890. Cady&#x27;s work was diverse, including residences, churches, colleges, libraries, museums, and railroad depots. His first major project was designing the Brooklyn Art Association&#x27;s Brooklyn Academy of Design in 1869, with architect Henry M. Cougdon.

Cady designed the American Museum of Natural History, the Metropolitan Opera House, and fifteen buildings at Yale University. Although much of his work centered around New York and New England, he also was the main architectural advisor for Berea College in Kentucky. Cady&#x27;s designs include one National Historic Landmark and twelve buildings that are individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

==Early life==
Cady was born in Providence, Rhode Island in January 1837, to Lydia Smith Platner and Josiah Cady, a deacon who was president of the Rhode Island State Anti-Slavery Society. Josiah Cady died in 1853.

Cady attended Bacon Academy and Plainfield Academy, both in Connecticut. He attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut for one year in 1857, and took additional classes in 1860. At Trinity, he was a member of the Fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall). However, he did not officially graduate.

Between 1857 and 1864, Cady pursued his studies in architecture in New York with an unknown German professor of architecture. He also studied watercolor painting with Alfred Fredericks.

== Career ==
Cady worked as a draftsman for Town &amp; Davis in New York City. In 1857, he helped found the American Institute of Architects (AIA), although he did not join at the time. He became a member when he started working professionally in 1864. He was made an AIA Fellow in 1865. Cady gave a presentation on old Dutch farmhouses of colonial New Jersey to the AIA New York City chapter. He also published a paper on opera houses in the AIA journal.

By 1864, he opened his practice, J. Cleaveland Cady, Architect. He advertised that he could provide designs and plans for churches, cottages, public buildings, residences, schools, stores, and warehouses. The &quot;Brooklyn Union&quot; described Cady as &quot;a young man of fine talents, of refined and cultivated taste, and profoundly zealous in his profession&quot;.

From 1864 to 1881, his offices were in the Trinity Building at 111 Broadway in Manhattan which served as a studio for dozens of architects, providing opportunities for many collaborations. In 1864, he worked with associates Rider &amp; Alden in Hartford, Connecticut. In May 1869, he was associated with architect Henry M. Cougdon.

In 1871, Milton See (1854–1920) joined his practice, followed by Louis DeCoppet Berg (1856–1945) in 1873. Both were just seventeen years old when they began working with Cady. In 1872, Bradford L. Gilbert began training under Cady; he later formed a successful national practice.

In 1880, Cady designed an elegant Old English double house at 1826 Massachusetts Avenue in the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia for sisters Mrs. Katherine Miller and Mrs. Charlotte E. Hopkins. The Hopkins-Miller House was named after their husbands, Colonel Hopkins and Lieutenant Miller. The double house had the appearance of a single large mansion from the outside. It faced Pacific Circle (later Dupont Circle).

In 1882, Cady formed the firm J. C. Cady &amp; Company. In 1890, the firm became known as Cady, Berg &amp; See. With formal training in Germany, Prussia, and Switzerland, Berg was probably the firm&#x27;s structural and mechanical engineer. See was the chief technician, while Cady was the chief designer. Their offices were located at 31 East 17th Street in New York City. They were joined by student draftsman William S. Gregory (1865–1945) in 1892. The firm dissolved in 1909.

Cady and Gregory formed a partnership known as Cady &amp; Gregory in 1909. They had offices at 6 West 23rd Street in New York City in 1913 and at 40 West 32nd Street in 1919. When Cady died, he left his share of the business to Gregory.

In 1920, Alexander Dana Noyes wrote, &quot;In his professional career, J. Cleveland Cady was perhaps the embodiment of the effort of American architecture, fifty years ago, to find itself while cutting loose from the false and meretricious standards of the Second Empire.&quot;

=== Honors ===
Trinity College presented Cady with an honorary M.A. in 1880, followed by an honorary LL.D. in 1905. Cady&#x27;s architectural library of more than 400 volumes is housed in Watkinson Library at Trinity College. This is &quot;one of the few intact architectural libraries of nineteenth-century America, allowing a rare glimpse into the working method of one of the era&#x27;s major architectural firms.&#x27; In 1993 Trinity College hosted the exhibition &quot;Forgotten Architect of the Gilded Age: Josiah Cleaveland Cady&#x27;s Legacy&quot; with a catalog by Kathleen A. Curran

== Projects ==



=== Cultural buildings ===

==== Brooklyn Academy of Design ====
Cady&#x27;s first important commission was to build the Brooklyn Art Association&#x27;s Brooklyn Academy of Design in 1889. For this project, he worked with architect Henry M. Cougdon, but there is no evidence that they worked together on other projects. They executed the stone building in high Victorian Gothic style in tones of brown, grey, and pink. Opening in 1872, the Brooklyn Academy of Design included exhibition space and studios for artists.

The building was pictured in &quot;The American Architect and Building News&quot; in January 1876. Architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler said that Cady&#x27;s Brooklyn Academy of Design was one of few successful examples of secular Gothic design.

==== Peabody Museum ====
Cady designed the original Peabody Museum of Natural History to house Yale University&#x27;s mineral collection, fossils, and exhibits on zoology and geology. The Gothic style building was constructed between 1873 and 1876 from brown and Nova Scotia stone, as well as Philadelphia-pressed brick. However, only a portion of Cady&#x27;s design was ever constructed. The museum was located at the corner of Elm and High Streets but was demolished in 1917.

==== Barron Library ====
Cady designed the Barron Library in Middlesex, New Jersey in 1877. This brownstone in Richardson Romanesque style has a Roman arch, a three-story tower, and stained-glass windows. This was likely the first time Cady used Richardson Romanesque style and is a restrained attempt because he wanted to blend the library into its rural background.

==== Metropolitan Opera House ====
Cady was the architect of the original Metropolitan Opera House which opened in October 1883. To get this contract, the firm won a design contest, gaining the advantage because of its functional design, fireproof materials, and low construction costs. It also incorporated the newest engineering technologies, including electric lights, elevators, an iron cage for structural support, a sprinkler system for fire suppression, and a simple air conditioning system. Architect Joseph J. Korom notes that on this project, Cady was &quot;a true architectural pioneer&quot;.

When completed, it seated 3,700 people and was the largest opera house in the world. Its four-story façade had matching seven-story towers with commercial establishments on the ground level, restaurants and ballrooms above, and apartments for bachelors in the upper levels—Korom calls this &quot;an early and excellent example of a multi-use project&quot;. Its plans were published in &quot;The American Architect&quot;, February 16, 1884.

Cady said the Metropolitan Opera House had &quot;a simple dignity that will not be tiresome or uninteresting as the years go by&quot;. Although its yellow brick and terracotta exterior was not particularly noteworthy, the Historic American Buildings Survey noted, &quot;its interior placed it among the great opera houses of the world&quot;. Cady&#x27;s original auditorium was destroyed by a fire on August 27, 1892; it was rebuilt by the architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings and was used until 1966. However, in 1939, the &quot;New York City Guide&quot; by the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, noted, &quot;The opera house was designed by J. C. Cady, a prominent architect of the day. That Mr. Cady was without experience in theater construction seemed to matter little; audiences ever since have paid for his mistakes, as but half the stage can be seen from the side seats of the balcony and family circle.&quot; The opera house was razed in January 1967.

==== American Museum of Natural History ====
Cady, Berg &amp; See designed the main building of the American Museum of Natural History (1899) in New York City. The firm was selected through an invitation-only contest held in 1887. The museum&#x27;s Romanesque Revival design was very open because of iron supports beneath the red granite façade. Running along the museum&#x27;s West 77th Street entrance, this was the longest public building façade in New York City. It included black cherry window frames, elaborate cornices, cartouches, eagles, finials, wreaths, and a wideporte-cochère. Joan Kelly Benard says, &quot;the 77th Street façade has been hailed as one of the finest examples of Romanesque Revival architecture in New York City.&quot; Inside, the building reflected a new approach to museum design; it included spaces for public exhibitions and scholarly study.

=== Colleges ===
Cady, Berg &amp; See designed buildings for many college including Bellevue Medical School, Berea College, Trinity College, Wesleyan University, Williams College, and Yale University.

==== Trinity College ====
At Trinity College, Cady designed Saint Anthony Hall (1878), a chapter house for the Fraternity of Delta Psi (St. Anthony Hall). Robert Habersham Coleman, a former classmate and fraternity brother of Cady, donated the funds to construct the chapter house. Architectural historian Kathleen A. Curran notes that Cady&#x27;s Romanesque Revival fraternity house design departed &quot;from the traditional &#x27;tomb-like&#x27; structures of fraternities at other schools [and]...was more a cross between a house and fortress.&quot; The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in November 1985.

He also designed the Jarvis Hall of Science (1899) at Trinity, a simple Romaneque-style building with laboratories and classrooms that was demolished in the 1960s.

==== Yale University ====
Cady designed more than fifteen buildings for Yale University, including the now demolished Dwight Hall (1885–1886), Berkeley Hall (1893–1894), White Hall (1893–1894), Pierson Hall (1896), Fayerweather Hall (1900–1901), Lampson Hall (1903), and Lyceum Hall (1903).

He designed three buildings for Yale&#x27;s newly organized Scheffield Scientific School—North Sheffield School (1873, demolished 1968), Winchester Hall (1892–1893, demolished 1968), and Sheffield Chemical Laboratory, now called Watson Hall (1894–1895).Cady&#x27;s brick and masonry Romanesque Revival design for North Sheffield became the template for Winchester and Watson Halls.The scientific school&#x27;s faculty approved of Cady&#x27;s reductionalist design.George Brush, head of Sheffield&#x27;s engineering department, praised North Sheffield Hall, saying:The building is considered a complete success; great surprise is expressed that with so simple an external form—a mere cube—such an admirable architectural effect has been produced, and the interior arrangements are so simple, complete and substantial, that everyone is impressed with the fact, that nothing has been sacrificed to mere decoration, but everything is for use...it is thoroughly well adapted for the uses of our institution.Cady&#x27;s design for the Yale Infirmary (1892) departed from his simple institutional buildings and instead looked like a Neocolonial or Georgian revival style mansion to create a refuge for sick students. He designed the Renaissance Revival style Hendrie Hall (1894–1900) for Yale&#x27;s Law School; it now houses the Adams Center for Musical Arts. He also designed Chittenden Hall (1890) also known as Memorial Library. Although only part of Cady&#x27;s design for Chittenden was constructed, Kathleen Curran says it is Cady&#x27;s &quot;most overtly Richardsonian [Romaneque] building.&quot;However, Curran says Sheffield Chemical Laboratory is &quot;the best remaining example of the craftsmanship of Cady&#x27;s buildings&quot;.

==== Williams College ====
In 1883, Cady designed the Morgan Hall dormitory for Williams College. This was followed by a Lasell Gymnasium in 1886. Both buildings are a mix of Romanesque Revival and Dutch Colonial Revival styles and were executed in Kentucky and Williamstown limestone.

==== Wesleyan University ====
Cady&#x27;s work at Wesleyan University started with a boiler plant in 1891. His next commission was Fayerweather Gymnasium in 1889. Cady&#x27;s Romanesque interpretation of a gym started a trend of Romanesque Revival style buildings on the Wesleyan campus. However, Berg&#x27;s expertise in engineering was also essential in the wide spans of the gymnasium. The firm also designed additions to Memorial Chapel in 1898. In 1904, construction started on Wilbur Fisk Hall, another of their designs.

==== Bellevue Medical School ====
Cady designed the Bellevue Medical School (1897), later known as the New York University Medical School. The Beaux-Arts style building is located at the southwest corner of 26th Street in New York City. Its first floor has arched windows outlined with wedge-shaped bricks.

==== Berea College ====
Cady was the main architectural advisor for the Berea College Square. He was also the uncle of William Goodell Frost, president of Berea College. Cady, along with landscape architect John Charles Olmsted, convinced Frost to select Colonial Revival style for the campus&#x27; architectural theme, rather than the obvious choice of rustic style for Appalachia. In 1906, Cady wrote to Frost:Such buildings would be proper for the forest reserves, farms, and farm laborers and even some men&#x27;s dormitories, but not on the main campus...If the College&#x27;s buildings seem merely to repeat the student&#x27;s old mountain environments, they will not be in line with the work their studies are doing for them. As they acquire education and a knowledge of the world, though they live in the mountains, they will hardly be content to live in the same cabins, and their regard and veneration for the College that helped them, will not likely be increased by the recollection of it as mainly a cluster of cabins... A College of log cabins would be a nightmare!
Cady designed Fairfield Hall (1873), also known as Ladies Hall, which was the first brick building on campus. Its eclectic design combines Italianate and Second Empire styles in a three-story structure. He also designed the brick and wood Berea College Hospital (1908, razed 1954) which was turned into a dormitory called Morningside Cottage in 1925. Cady designed the Colonial Revival style Boone Tavern in 1909 as a hotel for Berea College.

Around 1912, Frost asked his uncle to design a new teacher education building. As a gift to the college, Cady donated much of his time working on the project. Knapp Hall was dedicated on December 16, 1913. The small building housed 200 students, but Cady had designed it to use every space efficiently. To give the classrooms the best light possible, he extended the windows to the ceiling and placed the building on a true north axis. He also developed adjacent playgrounds.
=== Churches ===
Cady is credited with designing 25 church buildings using a variety of styles. A Presbyterian, Cady avoided the traditional Anglican and Catholic cruciform plan but instead used the English &quot;dissenting chapel&quot; arrangement. Schuyler was complimentary of &quot;the dignity and churchliness&quot; of Cady&#x27;s churches.

He designed two churches in Norwood, New Jersey in the Gothic revival style: the Alpine Community Church (1867) and the Church of the Holy Communion (1886-88). He used Stick style or Carpenter Gothic style for the First Presbyterian Church of Oyster Bay (1873) in Oyster Bay, New York and the Plantsville Congregational Church (1866) in Southington, Connecticut. St. William&#x27;s Catholic Church (1890) in Long Lake, New York was designed by Cady in the shingle style.

Cady used a traditional Byzantine church plan for the First Presbyterian Church (1889) in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and the Hampton Memorial Church (1886) at the Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia. The latter features a square tower that is tall and has a clock on all four sides. Inside, the wood trim is adorned with carved African American faces, and the yellow pine pews were built by students from the Hampton trade school.

Cady&#x27;s preferred style for churches was Romanesque Revival, including the Church of the Redeemer in Paterson, New Jersey; First Church Congregational in Fairfield, Connecticut; First Presbyterian Church (1882–1884) in Albany, New York; First Presbyterian Church (1901) in Ithaca, New York; Good Shepherd–Faith Presbyterian Church (1887–1893) in New York City; Presbyterian Church in Greenwich, Connecticut; South Street Presbyterian Church (1878) of Morristown, New Jersey; and the Webb Memorial Church in Madison, New Jersey.

Some of his many churches in New York City include the Broome Street Tabernacle (1884–1885), First Presbyterian Church on Brownell Street, Forsyth Street Synagogue (1890) which is now the Seventh Day Adventist Church, Grace Methodist Episcopal Church (1895; demolished), Gustavus Adolphus Swedish Lutheran Church (1887), New York Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church (1889–92) which is now Union United Methodist Church, Olivet Memorial Church, the Pilgrim Chapel for the Church of the Pilgrims (1878), the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant at the Mission (1871), St. Andrew&#x27;s Methodist Church (1889–90) which is now West Side Institutional Synagogue, and St. Paul&#x27;s German Lutheran Church of Williamsburgh.

One of his church designs was replicated several times. In 1880, he designed the Church of the Good Shepherd at Raquette Lake, New York. In 1881, those plans were modified at the request of Harriet Beecher Stowe for the Church of Our Saviour in Mandarin, Florida. The plans were used again in 1883 for the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beattystown, New Jersey.

=== Health and welfare ===
The New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor (AICP) hired Cady, Berg &amp; See to design the People&#x27;s Bath at 9 Centre Market Place in the Lower East Side. Curran says this became &quot;one of the most successful and well-publicized public baths in nineteenth-century America.&quot; As a result, the firm became the official architect for future designs of municipal baths in New York City.

In 1895, they were asked to submit a design for a grander bath facility for Tompkins Square Park—it was to include baths. This was to be the first in a group of five similar bathhouses. However, the community protested against having such a facility in their park, and it was never built. Later, New York City used a reworked version of their design for the Rivington Street Baths. The AICP criticized New York City and the architects for what they called &quot;a pretentious brick structure&quot;, finding it too grand, too large, and too expensive for the bathhouse scheme they had in mind.

Cady designed the Hudson Street Hospital (1893), Presbyterian Hospital (1886), and the New York Skin and Cancer Hospital (1898). His firm also designed a House of Relief (1894) on Hudson Street near the Hudson Street Hospital, both of which were operated by the New York Hospital. This five-story House of Relief with its distinctive twin stairway was used for clinical and emergency services.Cady, Berg &amp; See also designed the Christian Home for Intemperate Men (1881) on Madison Avenue, a Home for Old Men and Aged Couples (1897, demolished 1973) at Morningside Heights, and the Protestant Half Orphan Asylum (1893) on Manhattan Avenue. 

=== Residential ===
In 1865, Cady designed the Nordhoff estate for Mr. and Mrs. Charles Nordhoff in Alpine, New Jersey. In the February 1874 edition of &quot;The New–York Sketch–Book of Architecture&quot;, Cady shared a design for a Country-Home. Cady, Berg &amp; See designed around fifteen residential projects in New York City including those at 57–65 East 90th Street in Manhattan which are now in the Carnegie Hill Historic District and 16 and 8–4 Pierrepont Street in the Brooklyn Heights Historic District.

Designed by Cady, the Romanesque Revival style Othniel C. Marsh House was built from 1875 to 1881 in New Haven. At the time, the Marsh House was different from the Queen Anne style that was popular in New Haven. The New Haven Preservation Trust says the &quot;fortress-like mansion&quot; merges Jacobean revival style with some Queen Anne details. A professor of paleontology at Yale, Marsh left his home to the university. The building is a National Historic Landmark.

In 1876, Cady designed Cliffside, a Dutch Colonial Revival style stone mansion in Palisades, New York, for Lynda and Henry Lawrence. He designed the Charles H. Farnam Residence at 28 Hillhouse Avenue in New Haven in 1884 for attorney Charles Henry Farnam. With arched windows and an octagonal corner tower, Its design is eclectic but has similarities to Dutch Colonial style. Yale University has owned the Farnam house since 1920 and uses it for the Department of Economics.

=== Commercial ===
In 1872, Cady designed the Demarest Railroad Depot in Bergen County, New Jersey. In 1878, he designed an office in Dutch Colonial style for Harper Brother&#x27;s Publishing House. &quot;American Architect and Building News&quot; said, &quot;The whole room is the quaintest of quaint—a place to linger in.&quot;

Cady designed four commercial buildings that were considered skyscrapers in their day—the nine-story Gallatin Bank Building (1886, demolished) in New York City, the ten-story Lancashire Fire Insurance Company (1889) in New York City, the twelve-story Shoe and Leather Bank (1893) in New York City, and the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company (1897, demolished) in Hartford, Connecticut. The seven-story retail and residential towers of the Metropolitan Opera House were also considered skyscrapers.

Cady was Richard Morris Hunt&#x27;s biggest rival for the Tribune Tower competition; although the latter eventually won and designed the building in New York. However, Cady published his design in the July 1874 edition of &quot;The New–York Sketch–Book of Architecture&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1859, Cady married Julia Bulkley, daughter of the pioneering dermatologist Dr. Henry D. Bulkley of New York. They had one daughter, Alice Cleaveland Cady, before Julia died in 1869 from an inflammation of the lungs. In a letter to her parents, his niece Lavinia Goodell wrote, &quot;Poor Cleveland will feel the loss very deeply for he thought everything of her. The babe is only ten months old.&quot;

Cady built a summer home in Alpine, New Jersey in 1876. He married Emma Matilda Bulkley, the sister of his first wife, in 1881. She was a native of Orange, New Jersey, and was the second daughter of Dr. Bulkley. They had three children, including Julia Bulkley Cady, Cleaveland Cady, and Lyndon Bulkley Cady.

Cady was a devoted Presbyterian who served as head of the Sunday school at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant for 53 years. He was president of the National Federation of Churches and a member of the Religious Education Association. Cady also ran weekly prayer meetings at the Covenant Mission at the Presbyterian Church of the Covenant. He was vice–president of the New York City Mission for ten years, serving on the board for seventeen years. He was a trustee of Berea College, governor of the Presbyterian Hospital, and president of the New York Skin and Cancer Hospital. He was a member of the Alpine Club, the Century Association, the Quill Club, and the St. Anthony Club of New York.

On April 17, 1919, Cady died in his home at 214 Riverside Drive after two months of illness. He was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.

==Selected projects==
Following is a list of some of the surviving buildings that Cady designed. Many of these structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), are part of a National Register Historic District (NRHD) or a Local Historic District (LHD), or are a National Historic Landmark (NHL).

<doc id="564714" wikidata="Q3822175" url="?curid=564714" title="Michael Mansfield">
<text>Michael Mansfield (born 12 October 1941) is an English barrister and head of chambers at Nexus Chambers. He was recently described as &quot;The king of human rights work&quot; by The Legal 500 and as a leading Silk in civil liberties and human rights (including actions against the police).

A British republican, vegetarian, socialist and self-described &quot;radical lawyer&quot;, he has participated in prominent and controversial court cases and inquests including the Birmingham Six, Bloody Sunday massacre, the Hillsborough disaster and the deaths of Jean Charles de Menezes and Princess Diana and the McLibel case.

==Early life ==
Mansfield grew up in north Finchley, North London, and attended Holmewood Preparatory School (Woodside Park) before going to Highgate School and the University of Keele, where he graduated with a BA (Hons) in history and philosophy, and was Secretary of Keele&#x27;s Students&#x27; Union.

==Career==
Mansfield was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1967, became Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1989 and was elected as a Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 2007.

He is currently the president of the Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers. Mansfield is an after-dinner and keynote speaker.

===Notable cases===
As well as representing those wrongly convicted of the IRA&#x27;s Guildford and Birmingham pub bombings, Mansfield has represented: the Angry Brigade; Dolours and Marian Price; Brian Keenan; the Orgreave miners; Mahmood Hussein Mattan, Ruth Ellis and James Hanratty (in posthumous appeals); those involved in the Israeli Embassy bombing; Frank Crichlow, owner of the Mangrove restaurant; Stephen Lawrence&#x27;s family; Michael Barrymore at the Stuart Lubbock inquest; Barry George both at the inquest into the death of Jill Dando and George&#x27;s wrongful conviction; the gangster Kenneth Noye; the Bloody Sunday families; Arthur Scargill; Angela Cannings; Fatmir Limaj, a Kosovo-Albanian leader prosecuted in the Hague; Mohamed al-Fayed in the inquest into the deaths of his son Dodi al-Fayed and Diana, Princess of Wales; the Cambridge Two; the families of Jean Charles de Menezes and Mark Duggan; the Tottenham Three and the Cardiff Five. In March 2019 Mansfield was engaged by the family of footballer Emiliano Sala to represent their interests in the dispute over his death. 

Mansfield has been referred to as a &quot;champagne socialist&quot; though he has said that 95 per cent of his work comes from legal aid.

===Lockerbie bombing===
Warning against over-reliance upon forensic science to secure convictions, Mansfield in the BBC Scotland &quot;Frontline Scotland&quot; TV programme &quot;Silence over Lockerbie&quot;, broadcast on 14 October 1997, said he wanted to make just one point:
Forensic science is not immutable. They&#x27;re not written in tablets of stone, and the biggest mistake that anyone can make—public, expert or anyone else alike—is to believe that forensic science is somehow beyond reproach: it is not! The biggest miscarriages of justice in the United Kingdom, many of them emanate from cases in which forensic science has been shown to be wrong. And the moment a forensic scientist or anyone else says: &#x27;I am sure this marries up with that&#x27; I get worried.

==Political views==
In November 2019, along with other public figures, Mansfield signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot;, and endorsed Corbyn in the 2019 UK general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, he signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

==Charity work==
He is an environmental and animal rights activist and in 2019 said that meat may become banned in the future, and there should be a law made to criminalise ecocide, or destruction of the environment as a result of intensive animal agriculture. Mansfield is a patron of the animal rights organisation Viva! (Vegetarians International Voice for Animals) and refers to meat production as &quot;genocide&quot;. 

He is also patron of Hastings Advice and Representation Centre, a charity providing free welfare benefit advice and representation for local people in Hastings, East Sussex and the surrounding area. He is a co-founder and trustee of the charity Silence of Suicide (SOS).

==Personal life==
Mansfield has been married three times. He was married for 19 years to Melian Bordes, with whom he had five children, Johnathan, Anna, Louise, Leo and Kieran, and for 30 years to the artist/filmmaker Yvette Vanson, from whom he separated in 2014 and with whom he had a son, Fred. He has been with his current wife, Yvette Greenway, since 2015. His daughter, Anna, died by suicide in May 2015.

<doc id="564719" wikidata="Q2665508" url="?curid=564719" title="Hybrid system">
<text>A hybrid system is a dynamical system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamic behavior – a system that can both &quot;flow&quot; (described by a differential equation) and &quot;jump&quot; (described by a state machine, automaton, or a difference equation). Often, the term &quot;hybrid dynamical system&quot; is used instead of &quot;hybrid system&quot;, to distinguish from other usages of &quot;hybrid system&quot;, such as the combination neural nets and fuzzy logic, or of electrical and mechanical drivelines. A hybrid system has the benefit of encompassing a larger class of systems within its structure, allowing for more flexibility in modeling dynamic phenomena.

In general, the &quot;state&quot; of a hybrid system is defined by the values of the &quot;continuous variables&quot; and a discrete &quot;mode&quot;. The state changes either continuously, according to a flow condition, or discretely according to a &quot;control graph&quot;. Continuous flow is permitted as long as so-called &quot;invariants&quot; hold, while discrete transitions can occur as soon as given &quot;jump conditions&quot; are satisfied. Discrete transitions may be associated with &quot;events&quot;.

==Examples==

Hybrid systems have been used to model several cyber-physical systems, including physical systems with &quot;impact&quot;, logic-dynamic controllers, and even Internet congestion.

===Bouncing ball===
A canonical example of a hybrid system is the bouncing ball, a physical system with impact. Here, the ball (thought of as a point-mass) is dropped from an initial height and bounces off the ground, dissipating its energy with each bounce. The ball exhibits continuous dynamics between each bounce; however, as the ball impacts the ground, its velocity undergoes a discrete change modeled after an inelastic collision. A mathematical description of the bouncing ball follows. Let formula_1 be the height of the ball and formula_2 be the velocity of the ball. A hybrid system describing the ball is as follows:

When formula_3, flow is governed by
formula_4,
where formula_5 is the acceleration due to gravity. These equations state that when the ball is above ground, it is being drawn to the ground by gravity.

When formula_6, jumps are governed by
formula_7,
where formula_8 is a dissipation factor. This is saying that when the height of the ball is zero (it has impacted the ground), its velocity is reversed and decreased by a factor of formula_9. Effectively, this describes the nature of the inelastic collision.

The bouncing ball is an especially interesting hybrid system, as it exhibits Zeno behavior. Zeno behavior has a strict mathematical definition, but can be described informally as the system making an &quot;infinite&quot; number of jumps in a &quot;finite&quot; amount of time. In this example, each time the ball bounces it loses energy, making the subsequent jumps (impacts with the ground) closer and closer together in time.

It is noteworthy that the dynamical model is complete if and only if one adds the contact force between the ground and the ball. Indeed, without forces, one cannot properly define the bouncing ball and the model is, from a mechanical point of view, meaningless. The simplest contact model that represents the interactions between the ball and the ground, is the complementarity relation between the force and the distance (the gap) between the ball and the ground. This is written as
formula_10
Such a contact model does not incorporate magnetic forces, nor gluing effects. When the complementarity relations are in, one can continue to integrate the system after the impacts have accumulated and vanished: the equilibrium of the system is well-defined as the static equilibrium of the ball on the ground, under the action of gravity compensated by the contact force formula_11. One also notices from basic convex analysis that the complementarity relation can equivalently be rewritten as the inclusion into a normal cone, so that the bouncing ball dynamics is a differential inclusion into a normal cone to a convex set. See Chapters 1, 2 and 3 in Acary-Brogliato&#x27;s book cited below (Springer LNACM 35, 2008). See also the other references on non-smooth mechanics.

== Hybrid systems verification ==
There are approaches to automatically proving properties of hybrid systems (e.g., some of the tools mentioned below). Common techniques for proving safety of hybrid systems are computation of reachable sets, abstraction refinement, and barrier certificates.

Most verification tasks are undecidable, making general verification algorithms impossible. Instead, the tools are analyzed for their capabilities on benchmark problems. A possible theoretical characterization of this is algorithms that succeed with hybrid systems verification in all robust cases implying that many problems for hybrid systems, while undecidable, are at least quasi-decidable.

==Other modeling approaches==
Two basic hybrid system modeling approaches can be classified, an implicit and an explicit one. The explicit approach is often represented by a hybrid automaton, a hybrid program or a hybrid Petri net. The implicit approach is often represented by guarded equations to result in systems of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) where the active equations may change, for example by means of a hybrid bond graph.

As a unified simulation approach for hybrid system analysis, there is a method based on DEVS formalism in which integrators for differential equations are quantized into atomic DEVS models. These methods generate traces of system behaviors in discrete event system manner which are different from discrete time systems. Detailed of this approach can be found in references [Kofman2004] [CF2006] [Nutaro2010] and the software tool PowerDEVS.

<text>Martin Lister (12 April 1639 – 2 February 1712) was an English naturalist and physician. His daughters Anne and Susanna were two of his illustrators and engravers.

==Life==

Lister was born at Radcliffe, near Buckingham, the son of Sir Martin Lister MP for Brackley in the Long Parliament and his wife Susanna Temple, a daughter of Sir Alexander Temple. Lister was connected to a number of well known individuals. He was the nephew of both James Temple, the regicide and also of Matthew Lister, physician to Anne, queen of James I, and to Charles I. He was also the uncle of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough who corresponded with him throughout her life.

Lister was educated at Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire under Mr Barwick and matriculated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1658. He graduated in 1658/9, and was elected a fellow in 1660. In 1668 he travelled to France to study as a physician and settled at York in 1670 to practice medicine. He became Fellow of the Royal Society on 2 November 1671. He practised medicine at York until 1683, when he moved to London. In 1684 he received the degree of M.D. at Oxford on the recommendation of the Chancellor. In 1687 became F.R.C.P.

Lister bought Carlton Hall in Craven in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He attended the Earl of Portland when he was ambassador to France in 1698.

He was physician to Queen Anne from 1709 until his death. He died at Epsom at the age of 72 and was buried at Clapham Church. He bequeathed his books and copper-plates to the University of Oxford.

Lister was a prolific correspondent. More than 2,000 letters written by and to him survive in the Bodleian Library, Oxford and other repositories. They are to and from a variety of people including family, friends and other scientists. Abstracts of these letters have been published on line.

==Memorial inscription==
The memorial inscription for Lister in Clapham church is now lost. It read:

==Scientific work==
Lister contributed numerous articles on natural history, medicine and antiquities to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;. He was the first arachnologist and conchologist, and provided an unprecedented picture of a seventeenth-century virtuoso. Lister is recognized for his discovery of ballooning spiders and as the father of conchology, but it is less well known that he invented the histogram, provided Newton with alloys, and donated the first significant natural history collections to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Just as Lister was the first to make a systematic study of spiders and their webs, this biography is the first to analyze the significant webs of knowledge, patronage, and familial and gender relationships that governed his life as a scientist and physician. His principal works were &quot;Historiae animalium Angliae tres tractatus&quot; (1678) which was the first organised, systematic publication on shells; &quot;Historiae Conchyliorum&quot; (1685 1692), and &quot;Conchyliorum Bivalvium&quot; (1696). As a conchologist he was held in high esteem, but while he recognised the similarity of fossil mollusca to living forms, he regarded them as inorganic imitations produced in the rocks. Lister employed his daughters from an early age. His daughters, Anne Lister, and Susanna Lister were both credited as his illustrators and engravers.

In 1683 he communicated to the Royal Society (1684), an ingenious proposal for a new sort of maps of countries; together with tables of sands and clays, such as are chiefly found in the north parts of England. In this essay he suggested the preparation of a soil or mineral map of the country, and thereby is justly credited with being the first to realise the importance of a geological survey.

Charles Lyell speaks of Lister in his &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; as follows: 

, in his &#x27;Natural History of Oxfordshire.&#x27; (1677) attributed to a &#x27;plastic virtue latent in the earth&#x27; the origin of fossil shells and fishes; and Lister, to his accurate account of British shells, in 1678, added the fossil species, under the appellation of &quot;turbinated and bivalve stones&quot;. &#x27;Either,&#x27; said he, &#x27;these were terriginous, or if otherwise, the animals they so exactly represent &quot;have become extinct&quot;. This writer appears to have been the first who was aware of the continuity over large districts of the principal groups of strata in the British series, and who proposed the construction of regular geological maps.
He was a benefactor of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. The ridge Dorsa Lister in the Sea of Serenity on the Moon was named after him.

==Collections==

Before he died in 1712, Lister donated over a thousand books and manuscripts to the Ashmolean Museum, most of which were medical and scientific works. In 1769 John Fothergill gifted the Ashmolean several volumes of Lister&#x27;s letters and around 40 of his notebooks, which he had bought at auction.

In 1858 the Trustees of the Museum offered a transfer of their written artefacts to the Bodleian, and in 1860 more than 3700 volumes were received by the Library. Lister&#x27;s books and manuscripts form almost a third of this initial collection, making him its second-most represented donor next to Elias Ashmole. His series consists of c. 1260 volumes dating from the 16th to 18th centuries, their topics ranging through medicine, anatomy, natural philosophy, and botany, as well as into voyages and travel.

<text>Sir Richard Blackmore (22 January 1654 – 9 October 1729), English poet and physician, is remembered primarily as the object of satire and as an epic poet, but he was also a respected medical doctor and theologian.

==Earlier years==
He was born at Corsham, in Wiltshire, the son of a wealthy attorney. He was educated briefly at Westminster School and entered St Edmund Hall, Oxford, in 1669 at 15. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1674 and his MA in 1676. He was a tutor at the college for a time, but in 1682 he received his inheritance from his father. He used the money to travel. He went to France, Geneva, and various places in Italy. He stayed for a while in Padua and graduated in medicine at Padua. Blackmore returned to England via Germany and Holland, and then he set up as a physician. In 1685 he married Mary Adams, whose family connections aided him in winning a place in the Royal College of Physicians in 1687. He had trouble with the College, being censured for taking leave without permission, and he strongly opposed the project for setting up a free dispensary for the poor in London. This opposition would be satirised by Sir Samuel Garth in &quot;The Dispensary&quot; in 1699.

==Blackmore the epic poet==
Blackmore had a passion for writing epics. &quot;Prince Arthur, an Heroick Poem in X Books&quot; appeared in 1695. He supported the Glorious Revolution, and &quot;Prince Arthur&quot; was a celebration of William III. The poem was based on the form of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;The Aeneid&quot; and the subject matter of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. It told of the Celtic King Arthur opposing the invading Saxons and taking London, which was a transparent encoding of William III opposing the &quot;Saxon&quot; James II and taking London. John Dennis derided the poem as being &quot;servile&quot; in its treatment of Geoffrey of Monmouth and having an inconsequential and fearful hero. Nevertheless, it went through three editions and William made Blackmore physician-in-ordinary (a position he would hold with Queen Anne as well), gave him a gold medal, and knighted him in 1697. William also assigned Blackmore the task of writing the official treatment of the plot of Sir George Barclay, who sought to kill William (not appearing until 1723, as &quot;A true and impartial history of the conspiracy against the person and government of King William III, of glorious memory, in the year 1695&quot;). In 1697, Blackmore followed that with &quot;King Arthur: an Heroic Poem in Twelve Books&quot;. Like its predecessor, it was a treatment of current events in ancient garb, but, this time, the public and court were less interested and the matter less interesting. Additionally, Blackmore took John Milton as his model, rather than Virgil, and he admitted in his preface that his previous book had been too adherent to the Classical unities.

Having used his epics to fight political battles, albeit safe ones at first, Blackmore was opposed by wits of the other camp, especially as time went on. William Garth attacked Blackmore&#x27;s stance on the dispensary, only to be answered by Blackmore with &quot;A Satyr against Wit&quot; (1700). Tom Brown led a consortium of wits in &quot;Commendatory Verses, on the Author of the Two Arthurs, and a Satyr against Wit&quot; (1700). Blackmore had not only been explicitly partisan in his epics, but he had announced that epic was necessary to counter the degeneracy of poetry written by wits. Having answered Garth in 1700, he did not answer Brown. However, John Dryden accused Blackmore of plagiarizing the idea of an epic on Arthur from him and called him a &quot;Pedant, Canting Preacher, and a Quack&quot; whose poetry had the rhythm of wagon wheels because Blackmore wrote in hackney cabs on his way between patients (prologue to &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (1700)).

In 1705, with Anne on the throne and William dead, Blackmore wrote another epic, &quot;Eliza: an Epic Poem in Ten Books&quot;, on the plot by Rodrigo Lopez, the Portuguese physician, against Queen Elizabeth. Once more, the &quot;epic&quot; was current events, as it meant to denounce John Radcliffe, a Jacobite physician who was out of favor with Anne. Anne did not appear to take sufficient notice of the epic, but Sarah Churchill did. Two occasional pieces followed: &quot;An advice to the poets: a poem occasioned by the wonderful success of her majesty&#x27;s arms, under the conduct of the duke of Marlborough in Flanders&quot; (1706) and &quot;Instructions to Vander Beck&quot; (1709). These courted favor with the Duke of Marlborough with some success.

In 1711, Blackmore produced &quot;The Nature of Man,&quot; a physiological/theological poem on climate and character (with the English climate being the best). This was a tune up for &quot;Creation: A Philosophical Poem&quot; in 1712, which was praised by John Dennis, Joseph Addison, and, later, Samuel Johnson, for its Miltonic tone. It ran to 16 editions, and of all his epics it was best received. Its design was to refute the atheism of Vanini, Hobbes and (supposedly) Spinoza, and to unfold the intellectual philosophy of Locke. Johnson thought that it would be the sole memory of Blackmore, and Dennis said that it was the English &quot;De Rerum Natura,&quot; but with infinitely better reasoning.

Blackmore ceased writing epics for a time after &quot;Creation.&quot; In 1722 he continued his religious themes with &quot;Redemption,&quot; an epic on the divinity of Jesus Christ designed to oppose and confute the Arians (as he called the Unitarians). The next year, he released another long epic, &quot;Alfred&quot;. The poem was ostensibly about King Alfred the Great, but like his earlier Arthurian epics, this one was political. It was dedicated to Prince Frederick, the eldest son of King George II, but the poem vanished without causing any comment from court or town.

While others approached the epic as a celebration of national origins (Dryden, for example) or sought in it the most lofty subject matter possible (as Edmund Spenser and John Milton had done), Blackmore argued that the form of the epic would &quot;reform&quot; poetry, that it would cease the cavils of wits and the sexuality of rakes. Further, while proclaiming his intention of reforming poetry itself, he used his epics quite often to achieve political, and personal, goals.

==Non-epic writing==
Blackmore was a religious author when he was not a political author. In 1713 he and his friend John Hughes began a periodical modelled on &quot;The Spectator&quot; entitled &quot;The Lay Monk.&quot; It only ran from 13 November 1713 to 15 February 1714 and appeared once every three weeks during that period. All the same, Blackmore had its issues collected and published as &quot;The Lay Monastery&quot; in the year the journal foundered.

In 1716, he became censor as well as a director of the College of Physicians, but the Hanoverians were not as taken with Blackmore as William or Anne had been. In that year, he had two volumes of &quot;Essays upon Several Subjects&quot; published, with an attack on Alexander Pope in the second volume. In 1718, he again went to press with &quot;A Collection of Poems on Various Subjects,&quot; which collected shorter poems that had already been published.

Blackmore was very concerned with Protestantism. He joined the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in America in 1704. He wrote &quot;Just Prejudices against the Arian Hypothesis,&quot; putatively against Deism and Unitarianism in 1721 and then, to help matters, wrote &quot;Modern Arians Unmasked&quot; in the same year. He also produced &quot;A New Version of the Psalms of David&quot; in 1721 and tried to get the Church of England to accept them as canonical translations. The next year, he resigned his governing position in the College of Physicians, and he also continued his campaign against supposed Arians with &quot;Redemption.&quot; In 1724, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel was set to publish Blackmore&#x27;s Psalms as official for America, but the Bishop of London, Edmund Gibson (a conservative, but a Whig), opposed the project and kept it from coming to fruition.

Finally, Blackmore attempted to answer Deism again with &quot;Natural Theology, or, Moral Duties Consider&#x27;d apart from Positive&quot; in 1728. In 1731, his last work, &quot;The Accomplished Preacher,&quot; was published posthumously.

==As a physician==
Blackmore has come down, largely through the verse of Alexander Pope, as one avatar of Dulness, but, as a physician, he was quite forward thinking. He agreed with Sir Thomas Sydenham that observation and the physician&#x27;s experience should take precedence over any Aristotelian ideals or hypothetical laws. He rejected Galen&#x27;s humour theory as well. He wrote on plague in 1720, smallpox in 1722, and consumption in 1727.

He died in Boxted, Essex and was buried in his local parish church, where a monument was constructed.

==As a butt of satire==
Blackmore&#x27;s fame today rests with his enemies. Garth&#x27;s &quot;The Dispensary&quot; made him out to be a greedy fool with delusions, but Pope&#x27;s criticisms would be the most lasting, and Pope hits Blackmore over and over again on his stupidity and delusions of grandeur. The Scriblerus Club (Pope, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, Henry St. John, Jonathan Swift, and Thomas Parnell) attacked Blackmore in 1717&#x27;s &quot;Three Hours after Marriage.&quot; Pope further picked out Blackmore&#x27;s foolish lines in &quot;Peri Bathos&quot; (1727) and gives a devastating characterization of &quot;Neverending Blackmore&quot; in &quot;The Dunciad&quot; (1728), where Blackmore&#x27;s poetry is so awful that it can even put lawyers to sleep. These attacks were on top of Tom Brown&#x27;s previous attacks, as well as Dryden&#x27;s.

Blackmore&#x27;s poetry is leaden. What further qualified him as a &#x27;dunce&#x27; was his willingness to use poetry for the purposes of self-advancement. The self-interest involved in &quot;King Arthur&quot; was apparent to contemporaries, and the desperation of &quot;Alfred&quot; was similarly offensive to other poets. In addition, Blackmore used his poetry to vilify fellow poets, especially (but not exclusively) Tory poets, and that made him vulnerable to counter-attacks that he could not survive. Nevertheless, in his own time, he enjoyed the &quot;approbation of Locke, and the admiration of Molineux.&quot; His poetry was also praised by Watts and Matthew Henry, who frequently quoted Blackmore&#x27;s poems in his &quot;Commentary on the Whole Bible&quot;.

<text>Midwood is a neighborhood in the south-central part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded on the north by the Bay Ridge Branch tracks just above Avenue I and by the Brooklyn College campus of the City University of New York, and on the south by Avenue P and Kings Highway. The eastern border consists of parts of Nostrand Avenue, Flatbush Avenue, and Coney Island Avenue; parts of McDonald Avenue and Ocean Parkway mark the western boundary.

Midwood is part of Brooklyn Community District 14, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11210 and 11230. It is patrolled by the 70th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, Midwood is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 44th, 45th, and 48th districts.

==History==

The name &quot;Midwood&quot; derives from the Middle Dutch &quot;Midwout&quot; (middle woods; Modern Dutch: Midwoud), the name the settlers of New Netherland called the area of dense woodland midway between the towns of Boswyck (Bushwick) and Breuckelen (Brooklyn). Jan Snedeker, Jan Stryker, and Tomys Swartwout solicited from Director-General Stuyvesant the right of settling together on a level area of wilderness (&quot;vlacke bosch&quot;, the flat bush), adjacent to the outlying farms at Breukelen and Nieuw Amersfoort. Through Swartwout&#x27;s suggestion, the settlement was named the village of Midwout or Midwolde. In April 1655, Stuyvesant and the Council of New Netherland appointed Swartwout a &quot;schepen&quot; (magistrate), to serve with Snedeker and Adriaen Hegeman as the Court of Midwout.

Later, it became part of old Flatbush, situated between the towns of Gravesend and Flatlands.

Settlement was begun by the Dutch in 1652; they later gave way to the English, who conquered it in 1664, but the area remained rural and undeveloped for the most part until its annexation to the City of Brooklyn in the 1890s. It became more developed in the 1920s when large middle class housing tracts and apartment buildings were built.

Many residents refer to Midwood as &quot;Flatbush&quot;, or, erroneously, as being &quot;part of Flatbush&quot;, an older and more established neighborhood and former township, which in the 19th century included modern Midwood. The usage of Flatbush to mean Midwood dates to the period when the neighborhood was first formed, and known as South Greenfield.

Many also consider the nearby neighborhood of Fiske Terrace/Midwood Gardens to be part of Midwood, but, as in many cities, neighborhood boundaries in Brooklyn are somewhat fluid and poorly defined.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2020 United States Census, the population of Midwood was 52,835. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 73.6% White, 11.8% Asian, 7.6% Hispanic/Latino, 4.6% Black and 2.4% Other. There were 16% of residents over the age of 65. 

The entirety of Community Board 14, which comprises Flatbush and Midwood, had 165,543 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.4 years. This is slightly higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 25% are between the ages of 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 24% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 13% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 14 was $56,599. In 2018, an estimated 22% of Flatbush and Midwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Flatbush and Midwood, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Flatbush and Midwood are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

==Character==
===Shopping===
The main shopping streets in the area are Kings Highway, Avenue J, Avenue M, Flatbush Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and Coney Island Avenue.

====Kings Highway====


In the 1950s through the 1970s, Kings Highway had Dubrow&#x27;s Cafeteria, a classic cafeteria where holes would be punched in patrons&#x27; printed tickets, which would total the cost of the meal. In his run for the White House, Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy held a campaign rally just outside Dubrow&#x27;s Cafeteria. Years later, his brother Senator Robert F. Kennedy (&quot;Bobby&quot;) held a similar campaign rally there for his run for President. 

In the fall of 2008, the NYCDOT planned to implement an experimental congestion parking plan in the Kings Highway Business District, which would have raised parking meter rates from 75 cents to as much as $2.50 an hour. Specific streets were not then designated.

Kings Highway is currently anchored by several chain stores and multiple ethnic food stores. Unique businesses include several high fashion outlets, jewelry stores, and sushi restaurants.

The first Original Crazy Eddie store was located on Kings Hwy., then moved to larger quarters just south of Kings Highway on Coney Island Avenue.

====Nostrand Avenue====
Nostrand Avenue was known for fashionable boutiques. As retailers retired, the street changed and became known for its automobile showrooms. A U.S. Postal Service facility (Zip Code 11210) can be found on Nostrand Avenue between Avenues I and J.

====Lettered avenues====
Avenue J is a major business street in Midwood, with many kosher restaurants, deli, pizzerias, and butchers.

Avenue M, another one of the major business streets of Midwood, is a central location for kosher food and butchers. While in the past it was home to Cookie&#x27;s, one of Brooklyn&#x27;s best known restaurants and hang-outs (also popular with the NBC studio staff), today there are no fewer than ten kosher restaurants and three kosher bakeries. From the 1920s through the 1940s, the Dorman Square Restaurant was popular with the Vitagraph studios employees, as well as playing a role in a Vitagraph film or two.

Until the 1970s, Avenue M had its own movie theater. One of Brooklyn&#x27;s Italian restaurants, Restaurant Bonaparte, also catered to the actors and actresses working on Avenue M in the NBC studios at that time. Restaurant Bonaparte was known for its &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;. It also had a wishing well fountain in its lobby entrance, filled with customers&#x27; coins. The Avenue has an elevated subway station. Near the end of June each year, the Midwood Development Corporation hosts the popular Midwood Mardi Gras Street Fair along the Avenue, from East 12th Street to Ocean Avenue.

Shoppers can find a municipal muni-meter parking lot on East 17th Street at Chestnut Avenue just north of Avenue M. Many of the retail businesses are closed on Jewish holidays.

====Coney Island Avenue====
On Coney Island Avenue in Midwood, primarily between Avenue H and Avenue P, are the U.S. Postal Service Midwood 
station (Zip Code 11230), The Kent Triplex Movie Theater, and other retailers.

Between Avenue O and Quentin Road are Turkish restaurants and a hookah bar.

The United States&#x27; largest kosher supermarket opened at the corner of Avenue L and Coney Island Avenue in August 2008.

===Ocean Parkway===


Ocean Parkway is a major tree-lined Brooklyn boulevard, largely featuring apartment houses. It is not a shopping district. Local one-way traffic lanes are separated from the main roadway by bicycle lanes and running paths. Most avenues continue from one side to the other; Avenue K doesn&#x27;t. Ryder Avenue and Roder do neither: Though they are the same one-way road, their names differ by one letter. Ryder begins at McDonald Avenue, reaches Ocean Parkway, disappears on the opposite for one short block, then continues as Roder, ending at Coney Island Avenue.
===Movie theaters===
Midwood had several movie theaters, now mostly closed:

* One, still on Coney Island Ave, near Ave. H, is . It was built in 1939 with a single screen, becoming a triplex in the early 1990s.
* One was on Ave. M, the Century Elm, later an Emigrant Savings Bank branch and now an Apple Bank branch.
* Four of them were on Kings Highway:
** The Kingsway
** The Jewel
** The Avalon (closed in 1982)
** The Triangle theatre, which opened in 1936, closed in 1952, subsequently &quot;became a furniture store and by 2019 was a clothing store.&quot; It was located across from Sgt. Joyce Kilmer Triangle.

====Avalon Theater====
The Avalon Theater opened on January 25, 1928, and was located on Kings Highway at the southwest corner of East 18th Street. Originally built by a local Brooklyn company as the Piccadilly, it was sold prior to opening to Loews Theaters, which changed the name to Avalon. Designed by Samuel Cohen, the combined auditoriums (the main or lobby floor and the upstairs or balcony) seated 2,119 which included on the lobby floor a separate seating for children. It also featured a Robert Morton theatre pipe organ. Within a year of opening, it became part of the Century Theatres chain.

The theater closed in 1982, and the building now houses a Walgreens on the ground floor, and offices on the upper floors.

===East Midwood===

The area east of Ocean Avenue is also known as &quot;East Midwood&quot;. The volunteer ambulance service serving Midwood is Flatbush Hatzoloh. The nearest hospitals are New York Presbyterian Community Hospital and Mount Sinai, both on Kings Highway. Both are certified &quot;9-1-1 FDNY-EMS&quot; receiving emergency facilities. One of Brooklyn&#x27;s last remaining farms was located on the site of the apartment complex at 1279 East 17th St. (just north of Ave. M) until it was torn down in the mid-1960s. 

==Parks==
Parks include Kolbert Park and the Rachel Haber Cohen Playground and adjacent handball and basketball courts, near Edward R. Murrow High School, and the track and playing fields of Brooklyn College and Midwood High School.

Friends Field at East Second Street and Avenue L features baseball diamonds and tennis courts. Just opposite the field is the Erasmus Hall High School football field (closed to the public when not in use). 

The sprawling square block-long Midwood High School Field (East 16th–17th Street at Avenues K-L) features handball courts, tennis courts, a runners track and a field used for football, rugby and soccer. On June 2, 1958, a Maccabiah event was held at the field, at which Olympic weightlifting champion Isaac Berger, U.S. racewalking champion Henry Laskau, and Olympic hammer throw competitor Marty Engel gave exhibitions. Students from adjacent Edward R. Murrow High School also use the field during school hours.

There are two public pedestrian plazas in Midwood:

* Corporal Wiltshire Square, named in Honor of Corporal Clifford T. Wiltshire, located at the intersection of Ocean Avenue where it merges with Avenue P and Kings Highway. 27 year old Wiltshire, a married man residing at &quot;1022 Avenue P, was killed by a direct hit by a shell in October 1918&quot; while leading his comrades, after their sergeant was killed.
* , located at the crossroads of Kings Highway and Quentin Road (E. 12th–13th Streets), so named in honor of American journalist and poet Sgt. Joyce Kilmer (1866–1918). His is the smallest park in New York City, occupying of land.

===Judaism===
In the 1980s and 1990s, a wave of Orthodox Jews moved into the area from Borough Park, attracted by Midwood&#x27;s large homes and tree-lined streets. Today, in addition to Ashkenazic Orthodox Jews, the area is home to a burgeoning Sephardic population. Along Kings Highway from Coney Island to McDonald Avenues are many Middle Eastern style restaurants and take-out food shops.

==In popular culture==

===Film===
Midwood has long played a part in both film and television production. The film industry established itself in the neighborhood in 1907, when the Vitagraph company occupied studios at 1277 East 14th near Avenue M. Scenes from films like &quot;Hey Pop&quot; and &quot;Buzzin&#x27; Around&quot;, starring Fatty Arbuckle, were filmed on streets in Midwood. Warner Bros. purchased the studio in the 1920s, using it for short subjects, and moved the studio operation to Hollywood in 1939. A large smokestack bearing the name &quot;Vitagraph&quot; is still on the property, visible from the BMT Brighton Line. Many Vitagraph employees resided within the community.

The Brooklyn Historical Society and the Museum of the Moving Image (Astoria, New York) have collections on the Vitagraph Studios. An old vintage aerial photograph of the Vitagraph complex (and its streets) hangs today on a wall in the offices of the Midwood Development Corporation.

The Vitagraph Studios were later featured in a &quot;New York Times&quot; Article (2007), and in the PBS, WNET-13 TV Special &#x27;A Walk Through Brooklyn,&#x27; hosted by David Hartman and historian Barry Lewis. Old historic photographs of the studio show that part of it also existed across the Brighton line subway tracks where Edward R. Murrow High School now stands.

After Warner Bros. vacated the land (in the late 1960s-early 1970s), Yeshiva University purchased it for Brooklyn Torah Academy, the Brooklyn branch of their high school. The Shulamith School purchased the property some years later, when it merged BTA into Manhattan Torah Academy. Until 2015 the building was home to the Shulamith Yeshiva School for Girls, which moved to Manhattan Beach. Present day, many within the community were unaware that the Shulamith School buildings and property were once a film studio. In 2018, the yeshiva was replaced with an eight-story, 302-unit apartment building.

The Leading Male men&#x27;s attire store, once located at the corner of Kings Highway and East 12th Street, was the source for the disco attire that John Travolta and the other male cast members wore in the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. A duplicate of the white suit Travolta wore in the film was at that time displayed in one of the showcase windows.

===Television===

====NBC Studios====
In 1952, NBC Television purchased part of the Vitagraph Studios, which then became known as NBC Brooklyn. Studio 1 along Locust Avenue. A new larger studio known as Color Studio 2 at 1268 East 14th Street, on the northwest corner of Avenue M. Many programs were taped here.

When it was dedicated in 1954, it was said to be the world&#x27;s largest color TV production studio.

NBC sold the studio in 2000, and the facility became JC Studios. The facility was also used by CBS. In 2014, JC Studios closed, ending 60 years of TV history.

In 2015, OHEL Children&#x27;s Home and Family Services created offices in the former Studio 1 on Locust Avenue, part of the original Vitagraph Studios. Studio 2, built by NBC, became a self-storage facility.

<text>A closed-loop controller or feedback controller is a control loop which incorporates feedback, in contrast to an &quot;open-loop controller&quot; or &quot;non-feedback controller&quot;.
A closed-loop controller uses feedback to control states or outputs of a dynamical system. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., voltage applied to an electric motor) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with sensors and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is &quot;fed back&quot; as input to the process, closing the loop.

In the case of linear feedback systems, a control loop including sensors, control algorithms, and actuators is arranged in an attempt to regulate a variable at a setpoint (SP). An everyday example is the cruise control on a road vehicle; where external influences such as hills would cause speed changes, and the driver has the ability to alter the desired set speed. The PID algorithm in the controller restores the actual speed to the desired speed in an optimum way, with minimal delay or overshoot, by controlling the power output of the vehicle&#x27;s engine.
Control systems that include some sensing of the results they are trying to achieve are making use of feedback and can adapt to varying circumstances to some extent. Open-loop control systems do not make use of feedback, and run only in pre-arranged ways.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over open-loop controllers:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with model uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* unstable processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance
* improved rectification of random fluctuations

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed &quot;feedforward&quot; and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the PID controller.

== Open-loop and closed-loop ==
==Closed-loop transfer function==

The output of the system &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is fed back through a sensor measurement &quot;F&quot; to a comparison with the reference value &quot;r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). The controller &quot;C&quot; then takes the error &quot;e&quot; (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs &quot;u&quot; to the system under control &quot;P&quot;. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (&quot;SISO&quot;) control system; &quot;MIMO&quot; (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through vectors instead of simple scalar values. For some distributed parameter systems the vectors may be infinite-dimensional (typically functions).

If we assume the controller &quot;C&quot;, the plant &quot;P&quot;, and the sensor &quot;F&quot; are linear and time-invariant (i.e., elements of their transfer function &quot;C&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), &quot;P&quot;(&quot;s&quot;), and &quot;F&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the Laplace transform on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: formula_1
: formula_2
: formula_3

Solving for &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) in terms of &quot;R&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) gives

: formula_4

The expression formula_5 is referred to as the &quot;closed-loop transfer function&quot; of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from &quot;r&quot; to &quot;y&quot;, and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If formula_6, i.e., it has a large norm with each value of &quot;s&quot;, and if formula_7, then &quot;Y&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) is approximately equal to &quot;R&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID feedback control==
A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism control technique widely used in control systems.

A PID controller continuously calculates an &quot;error value&quot; as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. &quot;PID&quot; is an initialism for &quot;Proportional-Integral-Derivative&quot;, referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal.

The theoretical understanding and application dates from the 1920s, and they are implemented in nearly all analogue control systems; originally in mechanical controllers, and then using discrete electronics and later in industrial process computers.
The PID controller is probably the most-used feedback control design.

If is the control signal sent to the system, is the measured output and is the desired output, and is the tracking error, a PID controller has the general form

:formula_8

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters , and , often iteratively by &quot;tuning&quot; and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in process control). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well-established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if MIMO systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:formula_9
:formula_10

with the PID controller transfer function
:formula_11

As an example of tuning a PID controller in the closed-loop system , consider a 1st order plant given by

:formula_12

where and are some constants. The plant output is fed back through

:formula_13

where is also a constant. Now if we set formula_14, , and formula_15, we can express the PID controller transfer function in series form as

:formula_16

Plugging , , and into the closed-loop transfer function , we find that by setting

:formula_17

. With this tuning in this example, the system output follows the reference input exactly.

However, in practice, a pure differentiator is neither physically realizable nor desirable due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a phase-lead compensator type approach or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off are used instead.

<text>John Dennis (16 September 1657 – 6 January 1734) was an English critic and dramatist.

==Life==
He was born in the parish of St Andrew Holborn, London, in 1657. He was educated at Harrow School and Caius College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. degree in 1679. In the next year he was fined and dismissed from his college for having wounded a fellow student with a sword. He was, however, received at Trinity Hall, where he took his M.A. degree in 1683.

After travelling in France and Italy, he settled in London, where he became acquainted with Dryden, and close to Wycherley, Congreve and the leading literary figures of his day; and being made temporarily independent by inheriting a small fortune, he devoted himself to literature. The Duke of Marlborough procured him a place as one of the queen&#x27;s waiters in the customs with a salary of £20 a year. This he afterwards disposed of for a small sum, retaining, at the suggestion of Lord Halifax, a yearly charge upon it for a long term of years. In the years prior to 1704 he reigned as one of the leading coffee house wits alongside Congreve.

One of his tragedies, a violent attack on the French in harmony with popular prejudice, entitled &quot;Liberty Asserted&quot;, was produced with great success at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1704. For &quot;Appius and Virginia&quot; (1709), he invented a new kind of thunder. The play was not a success and the management of the Drury Lane Theatre withdrew it. But later at a performance of &quot;Macbeth&quot; there Dennis found the thunder produced by his method and said,

: That is &quot;my&quot; thunder, by God; the villains will play my thunder, but not my play.

According to &quot;Brewer&#x27;s&quot; entry (under the headword &quot;thunder&quot;), this is the origin of the phrase, &quot;to steal one&#x27;s thunder&quot;.

Dennis is best remembered as the leading critic of his generation, and as a pioneer of the concept of the sublime as an aesthetic quality. After taking the Grand Tour of the Alps he published his comments in a journal letter published as &quot;Miscellanies&quot; in 1693, giving an account of crossing the Alps where, contrary to his prior feelings for the beauty of nature as a &quot;delight that is consistent with reason&quot;, the experience of the journey was at once a &quot;pleasure to the eye as music is to the ear&quot;, but &quot;mingled with Horrours, and sometimes almost with despair.&quot; The significance of his account is that the concept of the sublime, at the time a rhetoric term primarily relevant to literary criticism, was used to describe a positive appreciation for horror and terror in aesthetic experience, in contrast to Ashley Cooper, The Third Earl of Shaftesbury&#x27;s more timid response to the sublime.

Dennis appears to have reached a turning point in 1704, when, at the age of 47 he withdrew from city life. In the years following this he appears to have become increasingly marginalised, both from new developments in cultural life, and from a new generation on the literary scene. His Essay on Italian Opera in 1706 argues that the introspection encouraged by the sensuality of music, but particularly Italian opera, is harmful to public spirit at a time of war. In 1711 he fell out with both Joseph Addison and Alexander Pope.

Samuel Johnson regarded Pope as the instigator of the latter dispute, his &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot; published mid-May 1711, having &quot;attacked [Dennis, characterised as Appius] wantonly&quot;, and provoking Dennis&#x27; &quot;Reflections Critical and Satirical upon a late Rhapsody Called, an Essay upon Criticism&quot;, the following month. Dennis&#x27; forensic skills as a critic enabled him to critique the flaws in the far younger poet&#x27;s observations, intended to show &quot;that as there is a great deal of venom in this little gentleman&#x27;s temper, nature has very wisely corrected it with a great deal of dullness … as there is no creature in nature so venomous, there is nothing so stupid and so impotent as a hunch-back&#x27;d toad; and a man must be very quiet and very passive, and stand still to let him fasten his teeth and his claws, or to be supriz&#x27;d sleeping by him, before that animal can have any power to hurt him.&quot; Lacerating pamphlets followed on both sides, culminating in Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad&quot;, and in a scathing note in the edition of 1729 (Book I, 1, 106), which included an insulting epigram attributed to Richard Savage, but now generally ascribed to Pope himself.

Dennis had fallen out with Addison in April 1711, over an essay that contained a good-humoured rejection of the notion of poetic justice in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, No. 40. His analysis of Addison&#x27;s highly successful patriotic tragedy in the &quot;Remarks upon Cato&quot; (1713) returned to this subject, and while Dennis&#x27; motivation may have been partly personally motivated, his criticism remains acute and sensible, and is quoted at considerable length by Johnson in his &quot;Life of Addison&quot;.

According to Thomas Macaulay (&quot;Life and Writings of Addison&quot;, p. 215) Pope seized the opportunity to respond on Addison&#x27;s behalf &quot;venting his malice under the show of friendship&quot;, with &quot;The Narrative of Dr. Robert Norris, concerning the strange and deplorable frenzy of John Dennis ...&quot; (1713). The pamphlet was full of personal abuse, exposing Dennis&#x27;s foibles, but offered no defence of &quot;Cato&quot;, and Addison repudiated any connivance in this attack, and indirectly notified Dennis that when he did answer his objections, it would be without personalities.

However, Dennis&#x27;s day as a leading figure on the London literary scene was over. He gained the nickname of &quot;Furius&quot;, while his enthusiasm for the terrible sublime was mocked. The apocryphal tale regarding his petitioning the Duke of Marlborough to have a special clause inserted in the Treaty of Utrecht to secure him from French vengeance, if true, suggests growing paranoia. (Marlborough joked that although he had been a still greater enemy of the French nation, he had no fear for his own security!)

Dennis outlived his annuity from the customs, and his last years were spent in great poverty. Bishop Atterbury sent him money, and he received a small sum annually from Sir Robert Walpole. A benefit performance was organised at the Haymarket (18 December 1733) on his behalf, for which Pope wrote an ill-natured prologue, which the actor and sentimental playwright Colley Cibber (another victim of Pope&#x27;s invective) recited. Dennis died within three weeks of this performance, on 6 January 1734.

Dennis&#x27; works were published in 1702, &quot;Select Works&quot; (2 volumes) in 1718, and Miscellaneous Tracts, the first volume only of which appeared, in 1727. Although Johnson was to call for a complete edition of Dennis&#x27; works, this was not undertaken until 1938.

For a contemporary account of Dennis see Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Poets&quot;, Volume 4; for a nineteenth-century view see Isaac Disraeli&#x27;s essays on Pope and Addison in the Quarrels of Authors, and On the Influence of a Bad Temper in Criticism in Calamities of Authors; for a contemporary account see the Preface and Introduction to Edward Niles Hooker&#x27;s &quot;The Critical Works of John Dennis&quot;.

<text>Hubert Robert Harry Gregg (19 July 1914 – 29 March 2004) was a British broadcaster, writer and actor. In his later years, he was known for the BBC Radio 2 &quot;oldies&quot; shows &quot;A Square Deal&quot; and &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot;. He was also a novelist, theatre director and hit songwriter.

==Biography==
Gregg was born in Islington, north London. He attended St Dunstan&#x27;s College and the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art.

Gregg worked as an announcer for the BBC Empire Service in 1934 and 1935, while intermittently performing in repertory theatre. He appeared on Broadway in Terence Rattigan&#x27;s comedy &quot;French Without Tears&quot; from 28 September 1937 to January 1938.

In the Second World War, Gregg first served as a private with the Lincolnshire Regiment in 1939, before becoming an officer in the 60th Rifles the following year. He spoke German fluently, and worked for the BBC German service, to such good effect that Goebbels assumed he must be a German traitor. He was invalided out in 1943. Among the &quot;more than 200 songs&quot; he wrote was the wartime hit &quot;I&#x27;m Going To Get Lit Up When The Lights Go up in London&quot;, written in 1940 and sung by his first wife, Zoe Gail, in George Black&#x27;s 1943 production &quot;Strike a New Note&quot;. It was broadcast in 1944 to alert the Resistance that the invasion of Europe was imminent.

On seeing German V1s flying over London, Gregg composed his best-known song, &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Because I&#x27;m a Londoner&quot;, in 20 minutes while on leave in 1944; it became a hit and London folk anthem in 1947. He also composed numbers for the musicals &quot;The Love Racket&quot; (1943), &quot;Sweet And Low&quot; (1944) and &quot;Strike It Again&quot; (1945).

After the war, he co-starred with Anne Crawford in &quot;Western Wind&quot; (1949) at the Manchester Opera House, and also directed Agatha Christie stage plays, including &quot;The Hollow&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; (for seven years, beginning in 1953). The period was the subject of his 1980 memoir, &quot;Agatha Christie and All That Mousetrap&quot;. He called Christie &quot;a mean old bitch&quot;.

Gregg presented and performed in numerous radio programmes, including &quot;A Square Deal&quot; for seven years, and &quot;Thanks for the Memory&quot; for over 30 years. He also acted in films and on television, in addition to writing light comedies and two novels.

==Personal life and death==
He was married three times: his first wife was the musical comedy star Zoe Gail, whom he married in 1943, with whom he had a daughter, actress-writer Stacey Gregg; the couple divorced in 1950.

In 1956, he married the actress and singer Pat Kirkwood, with whom he starred in the 1958 musical comedy &quot;Chrysanthemum&quot;. They divorced in 1979.

His third and final marriage was in 1980, to Carmel Lytton, with whom he had a son and a daughter.

Gregg died on 29 March 2004, aged 89, in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

<doc id="564755" wikidata="Q313833" url="?curid=564755" title="Stefan Stambolov">
<text>Stefan Nikolov Stambolov (; 31 January 1854 OS – 19 July 1895 OS) was a Bulgarian politician, journalist, revolutionary, and poet who served as Prime Minister and regent. He is considered one of the most important and popular &quot;Founders of Modern Bulgaria&quot;, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Bulgarian Bismarck&quot;. In 1875 and 1876 he took part in the preparation for the Stara Zagora uprising, as well as the April Uprising. Stambolov was, after Stanko Todorov, Boyko Borisov and Todor Zhivkov, one of the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime ministers. Criticised for his dictatorial methods, he was among the initiators of economic and cultural progress in Bulgaria during the time of the Balkan Wars.

He was killed in the center of Sofia by a plot from the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), including Naum Tyufekchiev, for his support to the Ottoman Empire, his dictatorial methods and his repression of the IMRO.

== Early years ==
Stefan Nikolov Stambolov was born in Veliko Tarnovo. His father took part in the &quot;Velchova Zavera&quot; plot against Turkish rule in 1835. Stambolov grew up around prominent revolutionists like Hristo Ivanov, the priest Matey Preobrazhenski, and Hristo Karaminkov. He began his education in his home town, but later (1870–1872) studied at the Seminary in Odessa. In 1878 he was for a short period of time a teacher in his home town, and later he went to Romania. He joined the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC). After the death of BRCC founder Vassil Levski, Stambolov was chosen as his successor. He was the leader of the unsuccessful uprising in Stara Zagora in 1875 and of the Turnovo revolutionary committee in the great uprising of April 1876.

== Political career ==
Stambolov was involved in political discussions as early as the time of the first Bulgarian parliament: the &quot;Founding Assembly&quot; of 1879. After 1880 he became the vice-chairman and later the chairman of the &quot;Narodno Subranie&quot; (the Bulgarian parliament). In 1885, he helped bring about the union of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On , officers aligned with Russia overthrew Prince Alexander in a coup d&#x27;état. Stambolov led a counter-coup on 28 August which removed the provisional government, and he assumed the position of regent. Russian hostility, however, barred the restoration of Alexander, who abdicated on 8 September.

== Regency ==
At the age of 32, Stambolov found himself in the highly unusual position of being simultaneously a government minister, president, and regent for an absent monarch. Stambolov&#x27;s style of governing during his regency was observed as being increasingly authoritarian. But this was, to some extent, a reaction to the grave difficulties arising from his peculiar position. Indeed, the regency has been described as marking the beginning of the tragic years of Stambolov&#x27;s life.

According to a close friend, Stambolov was &quot;almost inclined to resign the honours [of serving as regent], together with the dangers of his position, and retire to his beloved Turnovo.&quot; But he stayed on, recognizing that there was no other suitable candidate, and that if he did not lead, then Bulgaria&#x27;s sovereignty would likely be lost.

Through Stambolov&#x27;s efforts, a successor to Alexander was found in Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was proclaimed &quot;Knyaz&quot; (&quot;Ruling Prince&quot;) of autonomous Bulgaria on 7 July 1887 and crowned on 14 August 1887. However, it is known that Stambolov initially supported Carol I of Romania and that he intended to establish a union with the country. Russian opposition forced Carol I to reject the offer. Stambolov also requested to the Ottoman Empire a dual Bulgarian-Turkish state.

==Prime minister==
With Ferdinand&#x27;s accession to the throne, Stambolov retired as regent, and became Prime Minister. He served for seven years (1887–1894).

Stambolov was a nationalist; as a politician, he strengthened the country&#x27;s diplomacy, its economy, and the general political power of the state.

In 1891, he was targeted by some members of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) for his authoritarian methods and support for the Ottoman Empire. Naum Tyufekchiev, his two brothers and Dimitar Rizov tried to kill him. The attempt failed, but managed to kill the Minister of Finance, Hristo Belchev. The brother of Naum Tyufekchiev, Dencho was captured, tortured, and died in custody, but Naum managed to escape to Serbia and then to Odesa. He was sentenced to death in absentia.

He confronted &quot;Knyaz&quot; Ferdinand, and blocked his schemes to usurp additional authority. This caused him a lot of stress, and he became distant from his friends, and suspicious of all around him. The public came to dislike him, as he took increasingly drastic measures against his enemies. He survived an assassination attempt unharmed, but responded by having many people he suspected of taking part imprisoned and treated brutally.
By 1894 the prolonged stress from all sides had taken its toll, and Stambolov resigned, which was happily accepted by Ferdinand.

== Death ==
An assassination attempt aimed at him occurred in the center of Sofia, on the 15th of July.

While on the way to a club near his home, he was ambushed by four people. He was knocked to the ground and viciously beaten, resulting in his entire face being slashed, both of his arms almost completely severed, and his right eye gouged out.

Although he managed to survive this attack, he was left gravely injured and needed to be hospitalized. Although he experienced a slight improvement in his condition on the 16th, he ultimately succumbed to his injuries three days later, on the 18th.

== Assessment ==
Stambolov believed that the liberation of Bulgaria was an attempt by Czarist Russia to turn Bulgaria into its protectorate. His policy was characterized by the goal of preserving Bulgarian independence at all costs. During his leadership Bulgaria was transformed from an Ottoman province into a modern European state.

Stambolov launched a new course in Bulgarian foreign policy, independent of the interests of any great power. His main foreign policy objective was the unification of the Bulgarian nation into a nation-state consisting of all the territories of the Bulgarian Exarchate granted by the Sultan in 1870. Stambolov established close connections with the Sultan in order to enliven Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia and to oppose the Greek and Serbian propaganda. As a result of Stambolov&#x27;s tactics, the Sultan recognised Bulgarians as the predominant people in Macedonia and gave a green light to the creation of a strong church and cultural institutions.

Stambolov negotiated loans with western European countries to develop the economic and military strength of Bulgaria. In part, this was motivated by his desire to create a modern army which could secure all of the national territory.

His approach toward western Europe was one of diplomatic manoeuvring. He understood the interests of the Austrian Empire in Macedonia and warned his diplomats accordingly. His domestic policy was distinguished by the defeat of terrorist groups sponsored by Russia, the strengthening of the rule of law, and rapid economic and educational growth, leading to progressive social and cultural change, and development of a modern army capable of protecting Bulgaria&#x27;s independence.

Stambolov was aware that Bulgaria had to be politically, militarily, and economically strong to achieve national unification. He mapped out the political course which turned Bulgaria into a strong regional power, respected by the great powers of the day. However, Bulgaria&#x27;s regional leadership was short-lived. After Stambolov&#x27;s death the independent course of his policy was abandoned.

==Honours==
Stambolov Crag on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, is named for him.

Stambolov is portrayed on the obverse of the Bulgarian 20 levs banknote, issued in 1999, 2007 and 2020.

<text>In control theory, an open-loop controller, also called a non-feedback controller, is a control loop part of a control system in which the control action (&quot;input&quot; to the system) is independent of the &quot;process output&quot;, which is the process variable that is being controlled. It does not use feedback to determine if its output has achieved the desired goal of the input command or process setpoint.

There are many open-loop controls, such as on/off switching of valves, machinery, lights, motors or heaters, where the control result is known to be approximately sufficient under normal conditions without the need for feedback. The advantage of using open-loop control in these cases is the reduction in component count and complexity. However, an open-loop system cannot correct any errors that it makes or correct for outside disturbances unlike a closed-loop control system.

== Open-loop and closed-loop ==
== Applications ==

An open-loop controller is often used in simple processes because of its simplicity and low cost, especially in systems where feedback is not critical. A typical example would be an older model domestic clothes dryer, for which the length of time is entirely dependent on the judgement of the human operator, with no automatic feedback of the dryness of the clothes.

For example, an irrigation sprinkler system, programmed to turn on at set times could be an example of an open-loop system if it does not measure soil moisture as a form of feedback. Even if rain is pouring down on the lawn, the sprinkler system would activate on schedule, wasting water.

Another example is a stepper motor used for control of position. Sending it a stream of electrical pulses causes it to rotate by exactly that many steps, hence the name. If the motor was always assumed to perform each movement correctly, without positional feedback, it would be open-loop control. However, if there is a position encoder, or sensors to indicate the start or finish positions, then that is closed-loop control, such as in many inkjet printers. The drawback of open-loop control of steppers is that if the machine load is too high, or the motor attempts to move too quickly, then steps may be skipped. The controller has no means of detecting this and so the machine continues to run slightly out of adjustment until reset. For this reason, more complex robots and machine tools instead use servomotors rather than stepper motors, which incorporate encoders and closed-loop controllers.

However, open-loop control is very useful and economic for well-defined systems where the relationship between input and the resultant state can be reliably modeled by a mathematical formula. For example, determining the voltage to be fed to an electric motor that drives a constant load, in order to achieve a desired speed would be a good application. But if the load were not predictable and became excessive, the motor&#x27;s speed might vary as a function of the load not just the voltage, and an open-loop controller would be insufficient to ensure repeatable control of the velocity.

An example of this is a conveyor system that is required to travel at a constant speed. For a constant voltage, the conveyor will move at a different speed depending on the load on the motor (represented here by the weight of objects on the conveyor). In order for the conveyor to run at a constant speed, the voltage of the motor must be adjusted depending on the load. In this case, a closed-loop control system would be necessary.

Thus there are many open-loop controls, such as switching valves, lights, motors or heaters on and off, where the result is known to be approximately sufficient without the need for feedback.

==Combination with feedback control==

A feed back control system, such as a PID controller, can be improved by combining the feedback (or closed-loop control) of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or &quot;error&quot; remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open-loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can be based on the setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.

For example, in most motion control systems, in order to accelerate a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller is being used to control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and add it to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system in some situations.

<text>Oware is an abstract strategy game among the mancala family of board games (pit and pebble games) played worldwide with slight variations as to the layout of the game, number of players and strategy of play. Its origin is uncertain but it is widely believed to be of Ashanti origin.

Played in the Bono Region, Bono East Region, Ahafo Region, Central Region, Western Region, Eastern Region, Ashanti Region of Ghana and throughout the Caribbean, oware and its variants have many names - ayò, [[ayoayo]] (Yoruba), awalé (Ivory Coast, Benin), wari (Mali), ouri, ouril or uril (Cape Verde), warri (Caribbean) Pallanguzhi (India) wali (Dagbani), adji (Ewe), nchọ/ókwè (Igbo), ise (Edo), awale (Ga) (meaning &quot;spoons&quot; in English). A common name in English is awari but one of the earliest Western scholars to study the game, Robert Sutherland Rattray, used the name &quot;wari&quot;.

==Rules==
Following are the rules for the &quot;abapa&quot; variation, considered to be the most appropriate for serious, adult play.

===Equipment===

The game requires an oware board and 48 seeds. A typical oware board has two straight rows of six pits, called &quot;houses&quot;, and optionally one large &quot;score&quot; house at each end. Each player controls the six houses on their side of the board, and the score house on their end. The game begins with four seeds in each of the twelve smaller houses.


Boards may be elaborately carved or simple and functional; they may include a pedestal, or be hinged to fold lengthwise or crosswise and latch for portability and storage with the seeds inside. While most commonly located at either end, scoring houses may be placed elsewhere, and the rows need not be straight. When a board has a hinged cover like a diptych, the scoring houses may be carved into the two halves of the cover, and so be in front of the players during play. The ground may also be used as a board; players simply scoop two rows of pits out of the earth.

In the Caribbean, the seeds are typically nickernuts, which are smooth and shiny. Beads and pebbles are also sometimes used. In the West, some cheaper sets use oval-shaped marbles. Some tourist sets use cowrie shells.

===Objective===

The game starts with four seeds in each house. The objective of the game is to capture more seeds than one&#x27;s opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is sufficient to win the game. Since there is an even number of seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each player has captured 24.

===Sowing===


Example turn:

&quot;The lower player prepares to sow from E.&quot;

&quot;After sowing, e, d, and c are captured but not a.&quot;
Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under their control. The player removes all seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from this house, in a process called &quot;sowing&quot;. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. The starting house is always left empty; if it contained 12 (or more) seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. The diagram shows the result of sowing from house &quot;E&quot;.

Knowing the number of seeds in each house is, of course, important to game play. When there are many seeds in a house, sometimes enough to make a full lap of the board or more, they cannot easily be counted by eye, and their number is often guarded by the player who controls that house. This may be done by repeatedly moving the seeds in the house. A player may count the seeds when contemplating a move; in such cases the last few are usually counted in the hand to avoid revealing their number.

===Capturing===
In Oware Abapa, capturing occurs only when a player brings the count of an opponent&#x27;s house to exactly two or three with the final seed he sowed in that turn. This always captures the seeds in the corresponding house, and possibly more: If the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent&#x27;s house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on until a house is reached which does not contain two or three seeds or does not belong to the opponent. The captured seeds are placed in the player&#x27;s scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). However, if a move would capture all of an opponent&#x27;s seeds, the capture is forfeited since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game, and the seeds are instead left on the board. (However, see discussion on Grand Slam variations below). In the adjacent diagram, the lower player would capture all the seeds in houses &quot;e&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; but not b (as it has four seeds) or &quot;a &quot;(since it is not contiguous to the other captured houses).

===Let the opponent play===
The proscription against capturing all an opponent&#x27;s seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent&#x27;s houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in their own territory, ending the game.

===Winning===
The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or each player has taken 24 seeds (draw). If both players agree that the game has been reduced to an endless cycle, the game ends when each player has seeds in his holes and then each player captures the seeds on their side of the board.

==Variations==
===&quot;Grand slam&quot; variations===
A grand slam is capturing all of an opponent&#x27;s seeds in one turn. There are variations to the rule that applies, which may be one of the following:
# Grand slam captures are not legal moves.
# Such a move is legal, but no capture results. International competitions often follow this rule.
# Grand slam captures are allowed, however, all remaining stones on the board are awarded to the opponent.
# Such a move is legal, but the last (or first) house is not captured.

Various other rules also exist.

Variations allowing Grand slams to end the game are strongly solved by Henri Bal and John Romein at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam in 2002; either side can force a draw.

===Other===
One commercial version was marketed in 1964 by 3M, as the board game &quot;Oh-Wah-Ree&quot;.

==History and society==
Oware is perhaps the most widespread game in the mancala family of games.

Considered the national game of Bono State, Ashanti City-State, and Antigua &amp; Barbuda, oware is said to derive its name — which literally means &quot;he/she marries&quot; — from a legend in the Akan language and Twi, the language of the Akan people, about a man and a woman who played the game endlessly and, so as to be able to stay together and continue playing, they married.

Reflecting traditional African values, players of oware encourage participation by onlookers, making it perhaps the most social two-player abstract. In recreational play, it is normal for spectators to discuss the game in progress and to advise the players. Games may provide a focus for entertainment and meeting others. The game, or variations of it, also had an important role in teaching arithmetic to African children.

==Theory and Strategy==

As a strategy game, Oware requires keen strategic insights for human players. However, computer analysis has shown that Oware (or Awari) is a solved game for which, with best play, either player is able to force a drawn result.

<text>Richard Savage (c. 1697 – 1 August 1743) was an English poet. He is best known as the subject of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Life of Savage&quot;, originally published anonymously in 1744, which is one of the most elaborate of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the English Poets&quot;.

==Life==

===Early life===
What is known about Savage&#x27;s early life mostly comes from Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Life of Savage&quot;. However, such information is not entirely trustworthy, since Johnson did not feel the need to thoroughly investigate Savage&#x27;s past. Johnson relied almost solely on books, papers and magazines that publisher Edward Cave retrieved for him from &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;″s archives.

In 1698 Charles Gerard, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield, obtained a divorce from his wife, Anne, daughter of Sir Richard Mason. Shortly afterwards she married Colonel Henry Brett. Lady Macclesfield had two children by Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers, the second of whom was born at Fox Court, Holborn, on 16 January 1697, and christened two days later at St Andrew, Holborn, as Richard Smith. Six months later the child was placed with nurse Anne Portlock in Covent Garden. Nothing more is positively known of him, but Savage later claimed to be this child. He stated that he had been cared for by Lady Mason, his grandmother, who had put him in a school near St Albans, and by his godmother, one Mrs Lloyd. He said he had been pursued by the relentless hostility of his mother, by then Mrs Brett, who had prevented Lord Rivers from leaving £6,000 to him, had tried to have him abducted to the West Indies and then apprenticed him as a shoemaker in Holborn. Savage claimed to have discovered his true identity in 1714, through reading some letters by Mrs Lloyd. The first recorded occurrence of his name dates back to 1715, when he identified himself as &quot;Mr. Savage, natural son to the late Earl Rivers&quot; after being arrested for possessing a censored political pamphlet. He continued to use this name afterwards and gave further details of his parentage in Jacob&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Register&quot;.

===Early career===
Savage&#x27;s first certain work was a poem satirizing Bishop Hoadly, entitled &quot;The Convocation, or The Battle of Pamphlets&quot; (1717), which he afterwards tried to suppress. He adapted from a Spanish comedy, &quot;Love in a Veil&quot;, (acted 1718, printed 1719), which gained him the friendship of Sir Richard Steele, who became his first patron, and of Robert Wilks. With Steele, however, he soon quarrelled. In 1723 he played without success in the title role of his tragedy, &quot;Sir Thomas Overbury&quot; (1723), which nonetheless provided him a considerable amount of notoriety.

By that time, Savage&#x27;s story had become well known among literary circles, and he appeared lightly disguised in Eliza Haywood&#x27;s novel &quot;Memoirs of a Certain Island Adjacent to the Kingdom of Utopia&quot; (1725). Haywood, an actress and best-selling novelist whose works were often a cause of scandal, purportedly had a romantic relationship with Savage, with whom she was rumored to have had a son. Savage actively participated with Haywood in the era&#x27;s propensity for satire and praised her in several works, such as his prefatory poem for Haywood&#x27;s &quot;Love in Excess&quot;. The two later quarrelled, and Savage satirized her in scathing terms in &quot;Authors of the Town&quot; (1725) and in &quot;An Author to be Let&quot; (1730), in which he referred to her as a &quot;cast-off Dame&quot; who &quot;Writes Scandal in Romance.&quot; Haywood was also lampooned as nothing more than a literary prostitute in Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, for which Savage was one of the chief sources of petty gossip about the &quot;dunces&quot; of Grub Street portrayed in the satire.

In 1724 Savage was taken up by writer Aaron Hill, thus becoming part of a circle known as the &quot;Hillarian Group&quot;, which included several young poets such as John Dyer and James Thomson. Hill promoted their work in the bi-weekly magazine &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;. Savage&#x27;s relationship with Hill, which developed over a period of ten years, proved instrumental in providing him with the most important contacts in his career and, above all, in launching a persistent campaign to extort recognition and money from Mrs Brett.

Savage&#x27;s &quot;Miscellaneous Poems&quot; were published by subscription in 1726. Savage openly exposed the story of his birth in the Preface, and made repeated oblique references to his mother and his status of abandoned genius in many of the poems. Mrs Brett reportedly paid him money to suppress the &quot;Poems&quot;, either to soothe him or to silence him.

===1727 trial===

On the night of 20 November 1727, Savage ran into two acquaintances, James Gregory and William Merchant. After staying out drinking until past midnight, they demanded a room at Robinson&#x27;s coffeehouse near Charing Cross. Merchant, not being satisfied with being told to wait for a party of guests to depart, started a brawl in which Savage, amid the chaos, apparently stabbed and mortally wounded one James Sinclair, as well as injuring a maid. The following day, all three were committed in Newgate Prison, where they assured themselves that they would be charged with manslaughter, since no premeditation was involved in Sinclair&#x27;s death. However, on 6 December, when they appeared at court at the Old Bailey, they were charged with murder. Sinclair&#x27;s friends and the employees of Robinson&#x27;s coffeehouse, moreover, proved pitiless in their testimony for the prosecution. A Mr. Nuttal, although not having seen Savage inflict the wound, suggested Sinclair had already surrendered when Savage attacked him, while Mr Limery, another of Sinclair&#x27;s friends, saw Savage physically attack but reported that Sinclair still had his sword in hand. Further statements by Nuttal and Jane Leader, an employee at Robinson&#x27;s, clearly established that in his final dying words Sinclair explicitly identified Savage as the man who stabbed him. The defence, on the other hand, tried to establish Savage&#x27;s innocence by stressing the ill reputation of the Coffeehouse, by claiming that Savage acted in self-defence, and by insisting on the trustfulness and considerable social standing of the accused. The judge, Francis Page, was not impressed by their attempts, and in a speech filled with sarcastic comments made it clear to the jury what verdict he was expected to see delivered. At the end of an exceptionally long trial lasting eight hours, the jury found Savage and Gregory guilty of murder, and Merchant of manslaughter.

Savage&#x27;s and Merchant&#x27;s friends and acquaintances solicited a pardon from the Crown, as was customary following a death sentence. These did not include Savage&#x27;s mother, who not only maintained her lifelong hostility towards her supposed son, but also recounted an earlier incident in which Savage had broken into her house in one of his repeated attempts at reconciliation and, according to her, had instead attempted to murder her. Poet and playwright Charles Beckingham wrote a defensive pamphlet called &quot;The Life of Mr. Richard Savage&quot;, and even Lord Tyrconnel, Mrs Brett&#x27;s own nephew, petitioned to the king and queen for a pardon. Savage eventually escaped the death penalty by the intercession of the Countess of Hertford, who appealed to Queen Caroline.

===Subsequent fame and decline===

Savage&#x27;s conviction for murder and the subsequent pardon gained him a considerable amount of fame, and his story was sought over by booksellers and discussed in salons and coffeehouses, along with the behaviour of Mrs Brett. His newfound fame prompted him to publish in 1728 a confessional poem titled &quot;The Bastard&quot;, which made explicit mention of Mrs Brett, his trial and the pardon by the queen, and discarded his previous image of &quot;poor poet&quot; in favour of a celebration of his own genius. In 1729 Savage published &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, perhaps his best known work to date, a long narrative poem which showed the influence of James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;. Savage himself considered the poem to be his masterpiece.

The turn of Savage&#x27;s fortunes was also the result of a renewed campaign against his mother, which granted him in 1729 a fixed pension of the considerable amount of £200 per annum. Savage apparently obtained this through repeated extortion, as Johnson recounts that he &quot;threatened to harass her [Mrs. Brett] with Lampoons, and to publish a copious Narrative of her Conduct, unless she consented to purchase an Exemption from Infamy, by allowing him a Pension.&quot; Thanks to this pension, Savage now bordered on opulence, along with an apartment in Arlington Street, and free supplies of wine and books, all at the expense of Lord Tyrconnel.

Paradoxically, at the height of his popular fame, Savage was bound by his deal with Mrs Brett and Lord Tyrconnel to remain silent as a poet until 1735, except for an unusual arrangement with Queen Caroline to become a &quot;Volunteer Laureate&quot; which granted him from 1732 a further pension of £50 per annum until the queen&#x27;s death. The deal with Lord Tyrconnel also seemed to oblige Savage to dismiss his previous penchant for scandal in order to become a respectable member of society as his new patron was. The relationship between the two seemed genuinely based on Tyrconnel sympathy and admiration of Savage as a poet, and it was Tyrconnel himself who promoted him to the queen as a candidate for the laureateship. Savage&#x27;s literary inactivity (interrupted only by his occasional poems to the queen and to Robert Walpole, which he unsuccessfully tried to win as a patron) ultimately seemed to irritate Lord Tyrconnel, and by 1735 their relationship had deteriorated to the point that Lord Tyrconnel forbade him to continue living in his apartment in Arlington Street and stopped providing him his pension. Now reduced to poverty, Savage became a frequent target for a growing number of satires and attacks, but began publishing again for Cave&#x27;s &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

===Friendship with Samuel Johnson and final years===

It is not clear when Savage befriended writer Samuel Johnson, but it seems to have occurred in the latter years of the 1730s. How their friendship began is equally unclear, but Johnson relates having often accompanied Savage on his nighttime wanderings about London, where he witnessed the poet&#x27;s poverty and frequent occurrences of public humiliation. These encounters provided much of the material for the &quot;Life of Savage&quot;. Johnson was fascinated by the independence, and the spirit of protest and outrage in Savage&#x27;s character. He was also aware of the instability of mind which prevented Savage from taking positive control of his life. 

In the meantime, Savage&#x27;s financial situation worsened to the point that he had virtually no income. To save him from poverty, his longtime friend Alexander Pope launched a campaign involving several of his philanthropic acquaintances, including Ralph Allen, James Thomson and David Mallet. The purpose of this was to send Savage to Wales, where he could live with an annual allowance of £50. Pope also tried to push Savage into writing a letter to Sir William Leman, Mrs Brett&#x27;s legitimate daughter&#x27;s husband, begging him to intervene on his behalf with Lord Tyrconnel. Savage refused outright, a decision which was applauded by Johnson, since he considered the scheme to send Savage to Wales equivalent to exile.

Savage did eventually leave London in July 1739, thus breaking up his friendship with Johnson, with whom he had become a close literary ally. By spending his entire allowance as soon as he received it, Savage quickly alienated all his benefactors except Pope.
When in Wales, Savage lived in Swansea, then in England at Bristol, where he completed a new version of &quot;Sir Thomas Overbury&quot;. Harassed by creditors and abandoned by friends, Savage reverted to a nocturnal existence.

On the night of 10 January 1743, Savage was arrested for a debt of eight pounds and confined in the debtors&#x27; section of the Bristol Newgate Prison. He died there on 1 August 1743, probably from liver failure brought on by drinking.

==Parentage==
Savage&#x27;s parentage, while the subject of some dispute, is central to his legend. Besides the story related by Johnson, a romantic account of Savage&#x27;s origin and early life, for which he supplied the material, also appeared in Jacob&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Register&quot; in 1719.
Despite Savage&#x27;s persistent claims that Mrs Brett was his mother, she never acknowledged him as such. She claimed that both the children she had by the Earl Rivers died shortly after birth, and that the boy was buried in St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, with the name of Richard Portlock. Lady Macclesfield&#x27;s claims, however, are not incontrovertible, firstly because the boy buried as Richard Portlock may have been the son of nurse Ann Portlock (who Mrs Brett stated had named the baby); secondly, because of the yearly pension of £200 Savage began receiving in 1729 by Lord Tyrconnel who, being Mrs Brett&#x27;s nephew, seemed to recognize him to some degree.

Savage&#x27;s statements about his parentage, on the other hand, were not corroborated by the depositions of the witnesses in the Macclesfield divorce case, and Mrs Brett always maintained that he was an impostor. He was wrong in the date of his birth and, moreover, the godmother of Lady Macclesfield&#x27;s son was Dorothy Ousley, not Mrs Lloyd. There is nothing to show that Mrs Brett was the cruel and vindictive woman he describes her to be. Discrepancies in Savage&#x27;s story made James Boswell suspicious, but the matter was thoroughly investigated for the first time by William Moy Thomas, who published the results of his research in &quot;Notes and Queries&quot;. However, Clarence Tracy, in his biography &quot;The Artificial Bastard&quot; did give weight to Savage&#x27;s claims. In Richard Holmes&#x27; &quot;Dr. Johnson and Mr. Savage&quot; the author, though not in complete agreement, did not discount Tracy&#x27;s bias.

Savage was also the subject of the play &quot;Richard Savage&quot; by J. M. Barrie and H. B. Marriott Watson. It premiered at London&#x27;s Criterion Theatre in 1891 but was critically panned and performed only once. The Savage Club in London is named after him.

<text>The city of Warri is an oil hub within South-South Nigeria and houses an annex of the Delta State Government House. Warri City is one of the major hubs of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. Warri, Udu, Okpe and Uvwie are the commercial capital of Delta State with a population of over 311,970 people in 2006. The city is the indigenous territory of Itsekiri, Urhobo and Ijaw people.

Warri shares boundaries with Uvwie to the east, Udu to the south east, Ogbe-ijoh to the south, and other communities in Warri South LGA to the west. Due to its rapid population growth and linked roads, the city and its border towns, e.g. Uvwie, Udu merged into a conurbation collectively referred as &quot;Warri&quot;.

Warri sits on the bank of Warri River which joined Forcados River and Escravos River through Jones Creek in the lower Niger Delta Region. The city has a modern seaport, which serves as the cargo transit point between the Niger River and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export.

Warri served as the capital of the colonial Warri Province during the early 1900s when this part of Delta State was under the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.

==History==

===Etymology===
The name &#x27;WARRI&#x27; was first associated with the Itsekiri ancestral capital town of Ode Itsekiri which the locals also refer to as &#x27;Iwerre&#x27;. A mispronunciation of Iwerre by several European explorers probably resulted in various names like AWERRI, OUWERI, WARRE, WARREE, etc. The British eventually anglancised it as WARRI.

===British Advent pre Warri City===
British colonialism effectively took off in the Western Niger Delta with the proclamation of the Oil Coast Protectorate by Great Britain in June 1885. British colonial administration was carried out through local chiefs like Nana Olomu of Ebrohimi in Benin River. This administration was effectively restricted to Benin River and its environs as the British were content with conducting trade with the people of the hinterlands through the Itsekiri as middlemen.

===Creation of Warri City===
The British decided to move the seat of the administration of the Niger Coast Protectorate from the capital Ode-Itsekiri (Warri or Iwerre) to the uplands to have effective control of the hinterlands. In order to achieve this, the British in 1906 took a lease of a new trading station opened in 1898 on virgin lands for Alexander Miller Brothers Limited of Liverpool at the mouth of the Okere Creeks. This new trading station was also named WARRI after the capital Ode-Itsekiri so the Itsekiris dubbed Ode-Itsekiri BIG WARRI in order to differentiate Ode-Itsekiri from the new trading station.

==Demographics==
Its inhabitants are predominantly Christians of different denominations, and some practice a mixture of African traditional religions like most of Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique Pidgin, mostly among the less educated or uneducated.

==Climate==
The area is characterised by a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with a mean annual temperature of and an annual rainfall amount of . High temperatures are typically between . The climate is monsoonal and marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool &quot;harmattan&quot; dusty haze from the north-east trade winds. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief drier spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season. The surrounding region is predominantly rainforest, tending to swamplands in some areas. The vegetation is rich in timber trees, palm trees, as well as fruit trees.

== Economy and infrastructure ==
There is the Warri Refinery and Petrochemicals located at Ekpan and Ubeji, Warri proportionately with the majority of international and local oil companies operating in Nigeria having their operational offices close by.
One of the nation&#x27;s major seaports is sited within Ugbuwangue, Warri.

Due to conflict in the late 90s, especially in 1999, most oil companies fled the town and nearby regions.

=== Security ===
Warri is garrisoned by the Amphibious Infantry battalion (Effurun Army Base) located in the Effurun area.

The Nigerian Navy operates from its facilities in Warri.

The 61 Nigerian Air force Detachment also operates from its facilities in Jeddo, close to Warri.

==== Sports ====
Warri has an international stadium with a capacity of 30,000 which is the home of Warri Wolves football club, which has hosted two editions of the African Women Football Championship in 2002 and 2006 respectively and was in contention as one of the venues to be used for the FIFA Under-17 World Cup in Nigeria in 2009. The stadium was used to host the African Youth Athletics Championship (AYAC) in 2013.

Warri Wolves, a professional football team based in Warri plays in the Nigeria National League. Their prominent former players include Best Ogedegbe, Wilson Oruma, Efe Ambrose, Victor Ikpeba and Ekigho Ehiosun.

===Manufacturing and raw materials===

<text>The Rök runestone (; Ög 136) is one of the most famous runestones, featuring the longest known runic inscription in stone. It can now be seen beside the church in Rök, Ödeshög Municipality, Östergötland, Sweden. It is considered the first known piece of written Swedish literature and thus it marks the beginning of the history of Swedish literature.

==About the stone==
The , tall stone was discovered built into the wall of a church in the 19th century and removed from the church wall a few decades later. The church was built in the 12th century, and it was common to use rune stones as building material for churches. The stone was probably carved in the early 9th century, judging from the main runic alphabet used (&quot;short-twig&quot; runes) and the form of the language. It is covered with runes on five sides except the base which was to be put under ground. A few parts of the inscription are damaged, but most of it remains legible.

The name &quot;Rök Stone&quot; is something of a tautology: the stone is named after the village, &quot;Rök&quot;, but the village is probably named after the stone, &quot;Rauk&quot; or &quot;Rök&quot; meaning &quot;skittle-shaped stack/stone&quot; in Old Norse.

The stone is unique in a number of ways. It contains a fragment of what is believed to be a lost piece of Norse mythology. It also makes a historical reference to Ostrogothic king (effectively emperor of the western Roman empire) Theodoric the Great. It contains the longest extant pre-Christian runic inscription – around 760 characters – and it is a virtuoso display of the carver&#x27;s mastery of runic expression.

The inscription is partially encrypted in two ways; by displacement and by using special cipher runes. The inscription is intentionally challenging to read, using kennings in the manner of Old Norse skaldic poetry, and demonstrating the carver&#x27;s command of different alphabets and writing styles (including code). The obscurity may perhaps even be part of a magic ritual.

===Unicode===
This is a direct Unicode transliteration of the runes, as close to the scriptio continua original as possible. Ciphers are within brackets, with the resolution following the equals sign:

===Translation===

The following is the &quot;standard&quot; translation of the text provided by Rundata; most researchers agree on how the runes have been deciphered, but the interpretation of the text and the meaning are still a subject of debate.

&lt;poem&gt;In memory of Vámóðr stand these runes. And Varinn coloured them, the father, in memory of his dead son.

I say the folktale / to the young men, which the two war-booties were, which twelve times were taken as war-booty, both together from various men.

I say this second, who nine generations ago lost his life with the Hreidgoths; and died with them for his guilt.
:Þjóðríkr the bold,
:chief of sea-warriors,
:ruled over the shores
:of the Hreiðsea.
:Now he sits armed on
:§B his Goth(ic horse),
:his shield strapped,
:the prince of the Mærings.

§C I say this the twelfth, where the horse of Gunnr sees fodder on the battlefield, where twenty kings lie.

This I say as thirteenth, which twenty kings sat on Sjólund for four winters, of four names, born of four brothers:
:five Valkis, sons of Ráðulfr,
:five Hreiðulfrs, sons of Rugulfr,
:five Háisl, sons of Hǫrðr,
:five Gunnmundrs/Kynmundrs, sons of Bjǫrn.

Now I say the tales in full. Someone …

I say the folktale / to the young men, which of the line of Ingold was repaid by a wife&#x27;s sacrifice.

I say the folktale / to the young men, to whom is born a relative, to a valiant man. It is Vélinn. He could crush a giant. It is Vélinn …

§D I say the folktale / to the young men: Þórr.

§E Sibbi of Vé, §C nonagenarian, begot (a son).&lt;/poem&gt;

==Theodoric Strophe==

==Interpretation== 

Apart from Theodoric, Gunnr and the Norse god Thor, the people and mythological creatures mentioned are unknown. Some interpretations have been suggested:

The two war-booties are likely to be two precious weapons, such as a sword and a shield or a helmet. Several stories like these exist in old Germanic poems.

The &quot;Hreidgoths&quot; mentioned are a poetic name for the Ostrogoths, appearing in other sources. To what sea the name &quot;Hreiðsea&quot; Eastern Sea, referred is unknown. 
The part about Theodoric (who died in 526 A.D.) probably concerns the statue of him sitting on his horse in Ravenna, which was moved in 801 A.D. to Aachen by Charlemagne. This statue was very famous and portrayed Theodoric with his shield hanging across his left shoulder, and his lance extended in his right hand. The &quot;Mærings&quot; is a name for Theodoric&#x27;s family. According to the old English &quot;Deor&quot; poem from the 10th century, Theodoric ruled the &quot;castle of the Mærings&quot; (Ravenna) for thirty years. The words about Theodoric may be connected to the previous statement, so the stone is talking about the death of Theodoric: he died approximately nine generations before the stone was carved, and the church considered him a cruel and godless emperor, thus some may have said that he died for his guilt.

&quot;Gunnr&quot; whose &quot;horse sees fodder on the battlefield&quot; is presumably a Valkyrie (previously known from Norse mythology), and her &quot;horse&quot; is a wolf. This kind of poetic license is known as kenning in the old Norse poetry tradition.

The story about the twenty kings says that the twenty were four groups of five brothers each, and in each of these four groups, all brothers shared the same names, and their fathers were four brothers (4 × 5 = 20). This piece of mythology seems to have been common knowledge at the time, but has been totally lost. The &quot;Sjólund&quot; is similar to the name given to Roslagen by Snorri Sturluson but it has often been interpreted as Sjælland where the Iron Age Lejre Kingdom lay, (nowadays a part of Denmark).

Starting with the &quot;Ingold&quot;-part, the text becomes increasingly hard to read. While the first part is written in the 16 common short-twig runes in the Younger Futhark, Varinn here switches over to using the older 24-type Elder Futhark and cipher runes. It has been assumed that this is intentional, and that the rows following this point concern legends connected specifically to Varinn and his tribe.

After the word &quot;It is Vélinn ...&quot; follows the word &quot;Nit&quot;. This word remains uninterpreted, and its meaning is unclear.

In the last line, the carver invokes the god Thor and then he says that Sibbi &quot;of the shrine&quot; begot a son at the age of ninety. Since Thor is evoked before telling about Sibbi&#x27;s connection with the sanctuary and his potency at old age, it may be a recommendation that being a devout worshipper is beneficial.

Although much in the inscription is difficult to understand, its structure is very symmetrical and easy to perceive: it consists of three parts of (roughly) equal length, each containing two questions and one more or less poetic answer to those questions. As Lars Lönnroth and, after him, Joseph Harris have argued, the form is very similar to the so-called &quot;greppaminni&quot;, a sort of poetic riddle game presented by Snorri Sturluson in his Prose Edda.

==Theories==
There have been numerous theories proposed about the purpose of the stone. The most common include:

* Varinn carved the stone only to honour his lost son and the inclusion of mythical passages was a tribute from fantasy (Elias Wessén&#x27;s theory). There is strong evidence to support this view, not the least being the fact that Thor is referenced; this use of a deity in this context is quite conceivably a prefiguration of what was to later become a common practice (anterior to Christianity), where graves were frequently inscribed with runic dedications such as &quot;þórr vigi&quot;, &quot;may Thor protect you&quot;.
* Varinn carved the stone to raise his tribe to vengeance over the death of his son. The dramatic battle mentioned may have been the cause of his son&#x27;s death. (Otto von Friesen&#x27;s theory)
* Varinn carved the stone to preserve the tribal myths, as he had the function of a thul, the ceremonial story-teller of his ætt (clan), and this retelling task was to be passed on to his son. Perhaps he feared that the stories could be lost because of the death of his son, and therefore he tried to preserve them in a short form in the stone.
* The stone was a sign to strengthen the position of the tribe leader (since the stone could not be missed by anybody passing the land). He tries to justify his position by showing a long line of powerful ancestors which he follows.
* The battlefield where twenty kings lie has been connected (at least by Herman Lindkvist) to the Battle of Brávellir, which in Norse mythology took place not far from the location of the Rök stone about 50 years earlier.
* According to a hypothesis put forward by Åke Ohlmarks, Varinn was the local chieftain and as such also the one who performed sacrifices to the gods. Then arrived Ansgar, the first to bring Christianity to Sweden, and the wife of Varinn&#x27;s son Vémóðr/Vámóðr was baptized by him. Therefore, Varinn was forced to sacrifice his own son to the gods as indicated in the verse: &quot;I say the folktale / to the young men, which of the line of Ingold was repaid by a wife&#x27;s sacrifice&quot; (the word &quot;husl&quot; can be interpreted both &quot;sacrifice&quot; and &quot;baptism&quot;). Shortly: Vémóðr/Vámóðr paid with his life for his wife&#x27;s betrayal to the gods and Varinn had to kill his own son. That might also be the reason that Varinn used the word &quot;faigian&quot; (who is soon to die) instead of &quot;dauðan&quot; (dead) in the first line.
* Researchers at three Swedish universities (University of Gothenburg, Uppsala University and Stockholm University) hypothesize that the inscription alludes to climate crisis, Fimbulwinter, following the extreme weather events of 535–536, which occurred 300 years earlier, taking into consideration: the strongest known solar storm (774–775 carbon-14 spike) with its documented red skies, the exceptionally cold summer of 775 CE which affected crop yields, and the almost total solar eclipse in 810 CE, which gave the impression that the sun was extinguished shortly after dawn.
* In 2015, it was proposed that the inscription has nothing at all to do with the recording of heroic sagas and that it contains riddles which refer only to the making of the stone itself.

== In popular culture ==
* A transcription of the runes feature on the cover of the 1990 Black Sabbath album &quot;Tyr&quot;.
* Swedish Viking metal band King of Asgard released in 2010 the song &quot;Vämods Tale&quot;. The translation of the Rök runestone forms the song&#x27;s lyrics.

<text>Cell growth refers to an increase in the total mass of a cell, including both cytoplasmic, nuclear and organelle volume. Cell growth occurs when the overall rate of cellular biosynthesis (production of biomolecules or anabolism) is greater than the overall rate of cellular degradation (the destruction of biomolecules via the proteasome, lysosome or autophagy, or catabolism).

Cell growth is not to be confused with cell division or the cell cycle, which are distinct processes that can occur alongside cell growth during the process of cell proliferation, where a cell, known as the mother cell, grows and divides to produce two daughter cells. Importantly, cell growth and cell division can also occur independently of one another. During early embryonic development (cleavage of the zygote to form a morula and blastoderm), cell divisions occur repeatedly without cell growth. Conversely, some cells can grow without cell division or without any progression of the cell cycle, such as growth of neurons during axonal pathfinding in nervous system development.

In multicellular organisms, tissue growth rarely occurs solely through cell growth without cell division, but most often occurs through cell proliferation. This is because a single cell with only one copy of the genome in the cell nucleus can perform biosynthesis and thus undergo cell growth at only half the rate of two cells. Hence, two cells grow (accumulate mass) at twice the rate of a single cell, and four cells grow at 4-times the rate of a single cell. This principle leads to an exponential increase of tissue growth rate (mass accumulation) during cell proliferation, owing to the exponential increase in cell number.

Cell size depends on both cell growth and cell division, with a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell growth leading to production of larger cells and a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell division leading to production of many smaller cells. Cell proliferation typically involves balanced cell growth and cell division rates that maintain a roughly constant cell size in the exponentially proliferating population of cells.

Some special cells can grow to very large sizes via an unusual endoreplication cell cycle in which the genome is replicated during S-phase but there is no subsequent mitosis (M-phase) or cell division (cytokinesis). These large endoreplicating cells have many copies of the genome, so are highly polyploid.

Oocytes can be unusually large cells in species for which embryonic development takes place away from the mother&#x27;s body within an egg that is laid externally. The large size of some eggs can be achieved either by pumping in cytosolic components from adjacent cells through cytoplasmic bridges named ring canals (&quot;Drosophila&quot;) or by internalisation of nutrient storage granules (yolk granules) by endocytosis (frogs).

== Mechanisms of cell growth control ==

Cells can grow by increasing the overall rate of cellular biosynthesis such that production of biomolecules exceeds the overall rate of cellular degradation of biomolecules via the proteasome, lysosome or autophagy.

Biosynthesis of biomolecules is initiated by expression of genes which encode RNAs and/or proteins, including enzymes that catalyse synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates.

Individual genes are generally expressed via transcription into messenger RNA (mRNA) and translation into proteins, and the expression of each gene occurs to various different levels in a cell-type specific fashion (in response to gene regulatory networks).

To drive cell growth, the global rate of gene expression can be increased by enhancing the overall rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II (for active genes) or the overall rate of mRNA translation into protein by increasing the abundance of ribosomes and tRNA, whose biogenesis depends on RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase III. The Myc transcription factor is an example of a regulatory protein that can induce the overall activity of RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II and RNA polymerase III to drive global transcription and translation and thereby cell growth.

In addition, the activity of individual ribosomes can be increased to boost the global efficiency of mRNA translation via regulation of translation initiation factors, including the &#x27;translational elongation initiation factor 4E&#x27; (eIF4E) complex, which binds to and caps the 5&#x27; end of mRNAs. The protein TOR, part of the TORC1 complex, is an important upstream regulator of translation initiation as well as ribosome biogenesis. TOR is a serine/threonine kinase that can directly phosphorylate and inactivate a general inhibitor of eIF4E, named 4E-binding protein (4E-BP), to promote translation efficiency. TOR also directly phosphorylates and activates the ribosomal protein S6-kinase (S6K), which promotes ribosome biogenesis.

To inhibit cell growth, the global rate of gene expression can be decreased or the global rate of biomolecular degradation can be increased by increasing the rate of autophagy. TOR normally directly inhibits the function of the autophagy inducing kinase Atg1/ULK1. Thus, reducing TOR activity both reduces the global rate of translation and increases the extent of autophagy to reduce cell growth.

== Cell growth regulation in animals ==
Many of the signal molecules that control of cellular growth are called growth factors, many of which induce signal transduction via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which includes upstream lipid kinase PI3K and the downstream serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, which is able to activate another protein kinase TOR, which promotes translation and inhibits autophagy to drive cell growth.

Nutrient availability influences production of growth factors of the Insulin/IGF-1 family, which circulate as hormones in animals to activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in cells to promote TOR activity so that when animals are well fed they will grow rapidly and when they are not able to receive sufficient nutrients they will reduce their growth rate. Recently it has been also demonstrated that cellular bicarbonate metabolism, which is responsible for cell growth, can be regulated by mTORC1 signaling.

In addition, the availability of amino acids to individual cells also directly promotes TOR activity, although this mode of regulation is more important in single-celled organisms than in multicellular organisms such as animals that always maintain an abundance of amino acids in circulation.

One disputed theory proposes that many different mammalian cells undergo size-dependent transitions during the cell cycle. These transitions are controlled by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. Though the proteins that control Cdk1 are well understood, their connection to mechanisms monitoring cell size remains elusive.

A postulated model for mammalian size control situates mass as the driving force of the cell cycle. A cell is unable to grow to an abnormally large size because at a certain cell size or cell mass, the S phase is initiated. The S phase starts the sequence of events leading to mitosis and cytokinesis. A cell is unable to get too small because the later cell cycle events, such as S, G2, and M, are delayed until mass increases sufficiently to begin S phase.

== Cell populations ==
Cell populations go through a particular type of exponential growth called doubling or cell proliferation. Thus, each generation of cells should be twice as numerous as the previous generation. However, the number of generations only gives a maximum figure as not all cells survive in each generation. Cells can reproduce in the stage of Mitosis, where they double and split into two genetically equal cells.

== Cell size ==
Cell size is highly variable among organisms, with some algae such as &quot;Caulerpa taxifolia&quot; being a single cell several meters in length. Plant cells are much larger than animal cells, and protists such as &quot;Paramecium&quot; can be 330 μm long, while a typical human cell might be 10 μm. How these cells &quot;decide&quot; how big they should be before dividing is an open question. Chemical gradients are known to be partly responsible, and it is hypothesized that mechanical stress detection by cytoskeletal structures is involved. Work on the topic generally requires an organism whose cell cycle is well-characterized.

=== Yeast cell size regulation ===
The relationship between cell size and cell division has been extensively studied in yeast. For some cells, there is a mechanism by which cell division is not initiated until a cell has reached a certain size. If the nutrient supply is restricted (after time t = 2 in the diagram, below), and the rate of increase in cell size is slowed, the time period between cell divisions is increased. Yeast cell-size mutants were isolated that begin cell division before reaching a normal/regular size (&quot;wee&quot; mutants).
Wee1 protein is a tyrosine kinase that normally phosphorylates the Cdc2 cell cycle regulatory protein (the homolog of CDK1 in humans), a cyclin-dependent kinase, on a tyrosine residue. Cdc2 drives entry into mitosis by phosphorylating a wide range of targets. This covalent modification of the molecular structure of Cdc2 inhibits the enzymatic activity of Cdc2 and prevents cell division. Wee1 acts to keep Cdc2 inactive during early G2 when cells are still small. When cells have reached sufficient size during G2, the phosphatase Cdc25 removes the inhibitory phosphorylation, and thus activates Cdc2 to allow mitotic entry. A balance of Wee1 and Cdc25 activity with changes in cell size is coordinated by the mitotic entry control system. It has been shown in Wee1 mutants, cells with weakened Wee1 activity, that Cdc2 becomes active when the cell is smaller. Thus, mitosis occurs before the yeast reach their normal size. This suggests that cell division may be regulated in part by dilution of Wee1 protein in cells as they grow larger.

====Linking Cdr2 to Wee1====
The protein kinase Cdr2 (which negatively regulates Wee1) and the Cdr2-related kinase Cdr1 (which directly phosphorylates and inhibits Wee1 &quot;in vitro&quot;) are localized to a band of cortical nodes in the middle of interphase cells. After entry into mitosis, cytokinesis factors such as myosin II are recruited to similar nodes; these nodes eventually condense to form the cytokinetic ring. A previously uncharacterized protein, Blt1, was found to colocalize with Cdr2 in the medial interphase nodes. Blt1 knockout cells had increased length at division, which is consistent with a delay in mitotic entry. This finding connects a physical location, a band of cortical nodes, with factors that have been shown to directly regulate mitotic entry, namely Cdr1, Cdr2, and Blt1.

Further experimentation with GFP-tagged proteins and mutant proteins indicates that the medial cortical nodes are formed by the ordered, Cdr2-dependent assembly of multiple interacting proteins during interphase. Cdr2 is at the top of this hierarchy and works upstream of Cdr1 and Blt1. Mitosis is promoted by the negative regulation of Wee1 by Cdr2. It has also been shown that Cdr2 recruits Wee1 to the medial cortical node. The mechanism of this recruitment has yet to be discovered. A Cdr2 kinase mutant, which is able to localize properly despite a loss of function in phosphorylation, disrupts the recruitment of Wee1 to the medial cortex and delays entry into mitosis. Thus, Wee1 localizes with its inhibitory network, which demonstrates that mitosis is controlled through Cdr2-dependent negative regulation of Wee1 at the medial cortical nodes.

==== Cell polarity factors ====
Cell polarity factors positioned at the cell tips provide spatial cues to limit Cdr2 distribution to the cell middle. In fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; (&quot;S. Pombe&quot;), cells divide at a defined, reproducible size during mitosis because of the regulated activity of Cdk1. The cell polarity protein kinase Pom1, a member of the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK) family of kinases, localizes to cell ends. In Pom1 knockout cells, Cdr2 was no longer restricted to the cell middle, but was seen diffusely through half of the cell. From this data it becomes apparent that Pom1 provides inhibitory signals that confine Cdr2 to the middle of the cell. It has been further shown that Pom1-dependent signals lead to the phosphorylation of Cdr2. Pom1 knockout cells were also shown to divide at a smaller size than wild-type, which indicates a premature entry into mitosis.

Pom1 forms polar gradients that peak at cell ends, which shows a direct link between size control factors and a specific physical location in the cell. As a cell grows in size, a gradient in Pom1 grows. When cells are small, Pom1 is spread diffusely throughout the cell body. As the cell increases in size, Pom1 concentration decreases in the middle and becomes concentrated at cell ends. Small cells in early G2 which contain sufficient levels of Pom1 in the entirety of the cell have inactive Cdr2 and cannot enter mitosis. It is not until the cells grow into late G2, when Pom1 is confined to the cell ends that Cdr2 in the medial cortical nodes is activated and able to start the inhibition of Wee1. This finding shows how cell size plays a direct role in regulating the start of mitosis. In this model, Pom1 acts as a molecular link between cell growth and mitotic entry through a Cdr2-Cdr1-Wee1-Cdk1 pathway. The Pom1 polar gradient successfully relays information about cell size and geometry to the Cdk1 regulatory system. Through this gradient, the cell ensures it has reached a defined, sufficient size to enter mitosis.

===Other experimental systems for the study of cell size regulation===
One common means to produce very large cells is by cell fusion to form syncytia. For example, very long (several inches) skeletal muscle cells are formed by fusion of thousands of myocytes. Genetic studies of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila&quot; have revealed several genes that are required for the formation of multinucleated muscle cells by fusion of myoblasts. Some of the key proteins are important for cell adhesion between myocytes and some are involved in adhesion-dependent cell-to-cell signal transduction that allows for a cascade of cell fusion events.

Increases in the size of plant cells are complicated by the fact that almost all plant cells are inside of a solid cell wall. Under the influence of certain plant hormones the cell wall can be remodeled, allowing for increases in cell size that are important for the growth of some plant tissues.

Most unicellular organisms are microscopic in size, but there are some giant bacteria and protozoa that are visible to the naked eye. (See Table of cell sizes—Dense populations of a giant sulfur bacterium in Namibian shelf sediments—Large protists of the genus &quot;Chaos&quot;, closely related to the genus &quot;Amoeba&quot;.)

In the rod-shaped bacteria &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Caulobacter crescentus&quot; and &quot;B. subtilis&quot; cell size is controlled by a simple mechanisms in which cell division occurs after a constant volume has been added since the previous division. By always growing by the same amount, cells born smaller or larger than average naturally converge to an average size equivalent to the amount added during each generation.

==Cell division==

Cell reproduction is asexual. For most of the constituents of the cell, growth is a steady, continuous process, interrupted only briefly at M phase when the nucleus and then the cell divide in two.

The process of cell division, called cell cycle, has four major parts called phases. The first part, called G1 phase is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required for DNA replication.
The second part of the cell cycle is the S phase, where DNA replication produces two identical sets of chromosomes. The third part is the G2 phase in which a significant protein synthesis occurs, mainly involving the production of microtubules that are required during the process of division, called mitosis.
The fourth phase, M phase, consists of nuclear division (karyokinesis) and cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis), accompanied by the formation of a new cell membrane. This is the physical division of mother and daughter cells. The M phase has been broken down into several distinct phases, sequentially known as prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase leading to cytokinesis.

Cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Eukaryotic cell division either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two nuclear division processes. Binary fission is similar to eukaryote cell reproduction that involves mitosis. Both lead to the production of two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Meiosis is used for a special cell reproduction process of diploid organisms. It produces four special daughter cells (gametes) which have half the normal cellular amount of DNA. A male and a female gamete can then combine to produce a zygote, a cell which again has the normal amount of chromosomes.

The rest of this article is a comparison of the main features of the three types of cell reproduction that either involve binary fission, mitosis, or meiosis. The diagram below depicts the similarities and differences of these three types of cell reproduction.

===Comparison of the three types of cell division===
The DNA content of a cell is duplicated at the start of the cell reproduction process. Prior to DNA replication, the DNA content of a cell can be represented as the amount Z (the cell has Z chromosomes). After the DNA replication process, the amount of DNA in the cell is 2Z (multiplication: 2 x Z = 2Z). During Binary fission and mitosis the duplicated DNA content of the reproducing parental cell is separated into two equal halves that are destined to end up in the two daughter cells. The final part of the cell reproduction process is cell division, when daughter cells physically split apart from a parental cell. During meiosis, there are two cell division steps that together produce the four daughter cells.

After the completion of binary fission or cell reproduction involving mitosis, each daughter cell has the same amount of DNA (Z) as what the parental cell had before it replicated its DNA. These two types of cell reproduction produced two daughter cells that have the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Chromosomes duplicate prior to cell division when forming new skin cells for reproduction. After meiotic cell reproduction the four daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes that the parental cell originally had. This is the haploid amount of DNA, often symbolized as N. Meiosis is used by diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes. In a diploid organism such as the human organism, most cells of the body have the diploid amount of DNA, 2N. Using this notation for counting chromosomes we say that human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (2N = 46) while human sperm and eggs have 23 chromosomes (N = 23). Humans have 23 distinct types of chromosomes, the 22 autosomes and the special category of sex chromosomes. There are two distinct sex chromosomes, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. A diploid human cell has 23 chromosomes from that person&#x27;s father and 23 from the mother. That is, your body has two copies of human chromosome number 2, one from each of your parents.

Immediately after DNA replication a human cell will have 46 &quot;double chromosomes&quot;. In each double chromosome there are two copies of that chromosome&#x27;s DNA molecule. During mitosis the double chromosomes are split to produce 92 &quot;single chromosomes&quot;, half of which go into each daughter cell. During meiosis, there are two chromosome separation steps which assure that each of the four daughter cells gets one copy of each of the 23 types of chromosome.

===Sexual reproduction===
Though cell reproduction that uses mitosis can reproduce eukaryotic cells, eukaryotes bother with the more complicated process of meiosis because sexual reproduction such as meiosis confers a selective advantage. Notice that when meiosis starts, the two copies of sister chromatids number 2 are adjacent to each other. During this time, there can be genetic recombination events. Information from the chromosome 2 DNA gained from one parent (red) will transfer over to the chromosome 2 DNA molecule that was received from the other parent (green). Notice that in mitosis the two copies of chromosome number 2 do not interact. Recombination of genetic information between homologous chromosomes during meiosis is a process for repairing DNA damages. This process can also produce new combinations of genes, some of which may be adaptively beneficial and influence the course of evolution. However, in organisms with more than one set of chromosomes at the main life cycle stage, sex may also provide an advantage because, under random mating, it produces homozygotes and heterozygotes according to the Hardy–Weinberg ratio.

== Disorders ==
A series of growth disorders can occur at the cellular level and these consequently underpin much of the subsequent course in cancer, in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth and division beyond the normal limits, &quot;invasion&quot; (intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and sometimes &quot;metastasis&quot; (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood). Several key determinants of cell growth, like ploidy and the regulation of cellular metabolism, are commonly disrupted in tumors. Therefore, heterogenous cell growth and pleomorphism is one of the earliest hallmarks of cancer progression. Despite the prevalence of pleomorphism in human pathology, its role in disease progression is unclear. In epithelial tissues, misregulation of cellular size can induce packing defects and disperse aberrant cells. But the consequence of atypical cell growth in other animal tissues is unknown.

== Measurement methods ==
The cell growth can be detected by a variety of methods.
The cell size growth can be visualized by microscopy, using suitable stains. But the increase of cells number is usually more significant. It can be measured by manual counting of cells under microscopy observation, using the dye exclusion method (i.e. trypan blue) to count only viable cells. Less fastidious, scalable, methods include the use of cytometers, while flow cytometry allows combining cell counts (&#x27;events&#x27;) with other specific parameters: fluorescent probes for membranes, cytoplasm or nuclei allow distinguishing dead/viable cells, cell types, cell differentiation, expression of a biomarker such as Ki67. The total mass of a cell, which comprises the mass of all its components including its water content, is a dynamic magnitude and it can be measured in real-time and tracked over hours or even days using an inertial picobalance. A cell&#x27;s buoyant mass, which corresponds to the total mass of the cell minus that of the fluid it displaces, can be measured using suspended microchannel resonators.

Beside the increasing number of cells, one can be assessed regarding the metabolic activity growth, that is, the CFDA and calcein-AM measure (fluorimetrically) not only the membrane functionality (dye retention), but also the functionality of cytoplasmic enzymes (esterases). The MTT assays (colorimetric) and the resazurin assay (fluorimetric) dose the mitochondrial redox potential.

All these assays may correlate well, or not, depending on cell growth conditions and desired aspects (activity, proliferation). The task is even more complicated with populations of different cells, furthermore when combining cell growth interferences or toxicity.

<text>Southall is a railway station on the Great Western Main Line in Southall, London, England. It is in Travelcard Zone 4 and passenger services are provided by the Elizabeth line from . It is down the line from Paddington and is situated between to the east and to the west.

The station is managed by the Elizabeth line, and was rebuilt with step-free access as part of the Crossrail project.

==History==
The Great Western Railway opened Southall railway station on 1 May 1839, nearly one year after it opened its first railway line on 4 June 1838, between London Paddington and Maidenhead Riverside (the latter now known as Taplow). The Brentford Branch Line to Brentford Dock was opened for freight in 1859; a passenger service ran on the branch from 1 May 1860 until 4 May 1942, using the unnumbered platform at the south of the station (the line serving this platform is now only used as a relief line). From 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885 (when the service was discontinued as uneconomic) the District Railway ran trains between and Windsor which called at the station. The goods platforms opened as part of the original station were closed and dismantled in 1967. The Great Western Main Line was electrified through Southall in the early 1990s as part of the Heathrow Express project.

=== Crossrail ===
Southall was first proposed to be part of the Crossrail project in the 1990s. In 2004, public consultation into the project proposed a new station building with step free access, as well as platform extensions to serve longer trains. The number of seats available into Central London would treble, due to longer and more frequent trains.

In March 2010, the Crossrail Specialist Scrutiny Panel recommended that Crossrail should give consideration to the proposed regeneration developments in the area, including the Southall Gas Works development and the landscaping of unused work sites.

In May 2011, Network Rail announced that it would deliver improvements and alterations to prepare the station for Crossrail services. The work would include platform extensions, a new ticket hall designed by Bennetts Associates with level access from South Road, and step-free access to all platforms. Outside the station, public realm improvements funded by Transport for London and Ealing Borough Council would include widened pavements, street trees and cycle parking.

In 2015, Ealing Council approved the proposed work at Southall, allowing initial construction work to commence. In 2017, it was announced that completion of the station was delayed until 2019. In 2019, contracts for the new station building was awarded, allowing construction of the new station building. Following delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the refurbished station opened on 26 August 2021, providing step free access to all platforms.

===Accidents and incidents===

On 19 September 1997, a Great Western Trains passenger train from to failed to stop at a red signal and collided with a freight train, killing 7 people and injuring 139 others. The train driver, Larry Harrison, was charged with manslaughter, but the case against him was dropped. Great Western Trains was fined £1.5 million for the crash. Following this accident and the more serious Ladbroke Grove Rail Crash some miles east, First Great Western requires all its trains to have their ATP switched on at all times. If the equipment is faulty, the train is stored out of use.

=== Bilingual signage ===

Southall station has bilingual station signage, owing to the large Punjabi community in the local area. Station signs on the platforms bear &quot;Southall&quot; and also &quot;ਸਾਊਥਹਾਲ&quot; in Gurmukhī, a script commonly used for the Punjabi language. In 2007, following issues raised by other ethnic groups in the area, First Great Western announced it would review the signage. The bilingual signs were kept, and were still displayed at the station. In 2021, the new station building and platform roundel maintained the use of bilingual signage. It is one of the relatively few stations in England to have bilingual signage, others being Whitechapel (Bengali), Wallsend (Latin), Hereford (Welsh), Moreton-in-Marsh (Japanese) and St Pancras International, Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International (all French).

==Layout and facilities==
Southall railway station has five platforms, one of which is unnumbered and used only for freight and special events. In normal circumstances, platforms 1 and 2, on the fast lines, and the unnumbered platform are not used by passengers; platforms 3 and 4 are used by all trains serving the station.

<doc id="564781" wikidata="Q752111" url="?curid=564781" title="Woodstock, Oxfordshire">
<text>Woodstock is a market town and civil parish, north-west of Oxford in West Oxfordshire in the county of Oxfordshire, England. The 2021 census recorded a parish population of 3,521, up from the previous 3,100 in 2011.

Blenheim Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is next to Woodstock, in the parish of Blenheim. Winston Churchill was born in the palace in 1874 and buried in the nearby village of Bladon. Edward, elder son of King Edward III and heir apparent, was born in Woodstock Manor on 15 June 1330. In his lifetime he was commonly called Edward of Woodstock, but is known today as the Black Prince. In the reign of Queen Mary I, her half-sister Elizabeth was imprisoned in the gatehouse of Woodstock Manor.

The River Glyme, in a steep valley, divides the town into New and Old Woodstock. The town has two main suburbs: Hensington to the south and east of the town centre, and Old Woodstock to the north.

Woodstock Town Hall was built in 1766 to designs by Sir William Chambers. The almshouses were built in 1798 on behalf of Caroline, duchess of Marlborough. &quot;Chaucer&#x27;s House&quot; was once home to Chancellor of England, Thomas Chaucer, thought to be the son of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. The Church of England parish church of St Mary Magdalene has a Norman doorway and a turret clock that John Briant of Hertford made in 1792. The Oxfordshire Museum, the county museum of Oxfordshire, occupies a large historic house, Fletcher&#x27;s House, in the centre of Woodstock. The museum has a garden containing works of art and a Dinosaur Garden with a full-size replica of a &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. The town has a nursery, primary school and a secondary school, Marlborough School, and the parish is home to Oxford School of Drama. The mayor is Anne Grant.

==History==
The name Woodstock is Old English in origin, meaning a &quot;clearing in the woods&quot;. The Saxon name was Wudestoc, i.e. a woody place. The Domesday Book of 1086 describes Woodstock (&quot;Wodestock, Wodestok, Wodestole&quot;) as a royal forest. Æthelred the Unready, king of England, is said to have held an assembly at Woodstock at which he issued a legal code now known as &quot;IX Æthelred&quot;. Henry I may have kept a menagerie in the park. Woodstock was the scene of Henry II&#x27;s courtship of Rosamund Clifford (Fair Rosamund). The market of the town was established when Henry II gave Woodstock a market charter in 1179. The Bear Hotel in Park Street opposite The Oxfordshire Museum dates from the 13th century.

Near the village was Woodstock Palace, a residence that was popular with several English kings throughout the medieval period. The building was destroyed in the English Civil War. 60 years later the palace remains were cleared for the building of Blenheim Palace. From the 16th century the town prospered by making gloves. In the 17th century the town was altered greatly, when the 1st Duke of Marlborough became a permanent resident. The town had a successful fine steelwork industry by 1720 and by 1742 its products were of high enough quality to be considered viable diplomatic gifts. By the end of the 18th century this had developed into cut steel jewellery. Today it is largely dependent on tourists, many of whom visit Blenheim Palace.

===Elizabeth I===
When Thomas Wyatt led an uprising in 1554 to depose Queen Mary I and put Princess Elizabeth on the throne in her place, Elizabeth was imprisoned in a lodge in Woodstock as a precaution. The lodge was used because the now lost Woodstock Palace or manor house was too dilapidated to house her. A survey in 1551 reported that &quot;the mansion... for many years past hath been decayed.&quot; While imprisoned, Elizabeth wrote a poem. &quot;Much suspected by [of] me, None proved can be.&quot; She was released in April 1555 after nearly a year in captivity.

===Bell-foundry===
By 1626 James Keene, who had a bell-foundry in Bedford, had started one in Woodstock. Until 1640 another member of the family, Humphrey Keene, was a bell-founder with him. James died in 1654 and was succeeded by his son Richard. Richard Keene apparently closed the Woodstock foundry in the 1680s but continued casting bells at Royston, Hertfordshire, until 1703.

Numerous parish churches still have one or more bells cast by the Keenes, including at Asthall, Bloxham, Cassington, Charlton-on-Otmoor, Chastleton, Chesterton, Duns Tew, Eynsham, Garsington, Islip, Kiddington, Merton, Milton, North Moreton, Oddington, Rousham, Sandford St Martin, Stanton Harcourt, Steeple Aston, Steeple Barton, Stratton Audley, Tackley, Towersey and Woodeaton in Oxfordshire, Stowe and Water Stratford in Buckinghamshire, Stanton in Gloucestershire, Middleton Cheney in Northamptonshire and Martley in Worcestershire.

===Old railway station===
The town previously had a railway station, Blenheim and Woodstock railway station, initially privately run by the Duke of Marlborough until 1897 when it became part of the Great Western Railway. The final train to run on the line departed on 27 February 1954. The western end of the line, leading to the old station, is now a residential road, &quot;New Road&quot;. The part of the line on the eastern edge of the town now forms a nature area called the &quot;OWL&quot; (Old Woodstock Line) Nature Reserve.

==Blenheim Palace==
The Palace was designed by John Vanbrugh, in a heavy Italo-Corinthian style. It was designated to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough. Most of the palace was paid for by the nation. Churchill had been given the manor in perpetuity in honour of his victories over the French and the Bavarians at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession. The original manor, mostly ruined, was demolished as part of the project.

The greater part of the art treasures and curios were sold off in 1886, as was the great library collected by Charles Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, the son-in-law of the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1881. The magnificent park contains Fair Rosamund&#x27;s Well, near which stood her bower. On the summit of a hill stands a column commemorating the duke. Blenheim Park forms a separate parish.

Blenheim Palace was the hosting venue for the 4th European Political Community Summit on 18 July 2024.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Woodstock, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Woodstock Town Council, West Oxfordshire District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council is based at the Town Hall in the Market Place.

===Administrative history===
The original settlement of Woodstock, now known as Old Woodstock, is to the north of the River Glyme. It was historically a small hamlet at the southern end of the parish of Wootton. The later town appears to have been laid out as a planned settlement in the 12th century on a previously unoccupied site in the parish of Bladon, south of the Glyme. The town was officially called New Woodstock until the 19th century. New Woodstock subsequently came to be treated as a separate civil parish from Bladon.

In the Hundred Rolls of 1279 Woodstock is described as a vill, but a burgess is alluded to in the same document, and it returned two members to parliament as a borough in 1302 and 1305. The earliest known municipal charter was that from Henry VI in 1453, establishing the vill of New Woodstock a free borough, with a merchant guild, and incorporating the burgesses under the title of the &quot;Mayor and Commonalty of the Vill of New Woodstock.&quot; The Woodstock parliamentary borough was then exempted from sending representatives to parliament, but it subsequently resumed electing two members in the 16th century.

The borough was left unreformed when most boroughs across the country were standardised under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Government commissioners had concluded that the borough corporation had too few functions and the town was too small to justify the cost of reform. The borough corporation continued to exist, but did not qualify to take on any subsequent new local government powers. The Municipal Corporations Act 1883 directed that the remaining unreformed boroughs, including New Woodstock, would be abolished in 1886 unless they managed to secure a new charter converting them into a modern municipal borough. A new charter was granted in 1886; the reformed borough covered a larger area, also taking in Old Woodstock and part of the neighbouring parish of Hensington (formerly a hamlet in the parish of Bladon which had become a separate civil parish in 1866). The enlarged borough, which after the 1886 enlargement included both Old Woodstock and New Woodstock, was renamed Woodstock.

The borough of Woodstock was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new West Oxfordshire District Council. A successor parish called Woodstock was created covering the area of the abolished borough, with its parish council taking the name Woodstock Town Council.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Oxford on 95.2 FM, Heart South on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South (formerly Jack FM) on 106.4 FM and Witney Radio, a community based station which broadcast to the town on 90.2 FM. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Woodstock and Bladon News&quot;.

==Sport and leisure==
Woodstock has a Non-League football club, Woodstock Town, who play at New Road. At the start of the 2023–2024 season, Woodstock Town moved both senior sides playing into the Oxfordshire_Senior_Football_League. The town has Tennis Courts and a Bowling Green situated next to New Road Park. The town has a lido, next to The Marlborough School, which opens in the summer months.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Last Bus to Woodstock&quot; is a crime novel by Colin Dexter.

==Notable people==
* Mary Brook, who wrote about prayer, was born here in about 1726. Her writing was published in several languages and editions.
* Economist, broadcaster and diplomat Peter Jay (1937–2024), lived in Woodstock, was a town councillor and was mayor in 2010.

<text>The chondrophores or porpitids are a small group of hydrozoans in the family Porpitidae. Though it derives from an outdated name for this lineage, some still find the term &#x27;chondrophore&#x27; useful as a synonym to &#x27;porpitid&#x27; in discussions of the two genera contained therein, &quot;Porpita&quot; and &quot;Velella&quot;.

They all live at the surface of the open ocean, and are colonies of carnivorous, free-floating hydroids whose role in the plankton community is similar to that of pelagic jellyfish. The chondrophores look like a single organism but are actually colonial animals, made up of orderly cooperatives of polyps living under specialized sail-structures.

The most familiar members of the family Porpitidae are the blue button (&quot;Porpita porpita&quot;) and the by-the-wind sailor (&quot;Velella velella&quot;).

==Description==

The tiny individual animals are specialized to perform specific tasks; some form the central gas-filled disc (which is a golden brown colour and hardened by chitinous material) essential to keeping the colony afloat; others form radiating tentacles for tasks such as catching prey, reproduction, and digestion. Microplankton is a chondrophore&#x27;s principal prey. Although none have powerful stings, contact with the skin may cause irritation. At the mercy of winds and currents, chondrophores are pelagic and drift in the open ocean. They are often seen in large aggregations; mass beachings are not unusual. Chondrophores multiply by releasing tiny () medusae, which go on to develop new colonies.

&quot;Velella&quot; differs from &quot;Porpita&quot; by their transparent, membranous sail-shaped floats; filled with gas, the membranes have a texture reminiscent of cellophane. Both genera have turquoise to dark blue mantles and tentacles, with lemon-yellow morphs occasionally encountered. Neither group is particularly large: the floats of &quot;Velella&quot; are usually under 7.6 centimetres (3 inches) in diameter, while those of &quot;Porpita&quot; are usually less than 3.8 centimetres (1.5 inches).

==Systematics==
The order Chondrophora was created by A.K. Totton in 1954 to accommodate these unusual genera of Hydrozoa as their taxonomic affinities were unclear. They had previously been placed either in the Anthomedusae (also known as Athecata) or the Siphonophorae, and though many accepted Totton&#x27;s placement, a considerable number of authors maintained them in the Anthomedusae/Athecata all the time.

By the 1970s/1980s, nearly all Hydrozoan systematists were in agreement that these genera did indeed belong in that group and the order Chondrophora became defunct, replaced by the family Porpitidae, which took priority over the more recent name &quot;Velellidae&quot; (the group was subdivided into these two families when still ranked as an order). In modern classifications, the Porpitidae are included in the hydrozoan suborder Capitata.

They are believed to have originated in the late Proterozoic period, some 650–540 million years ago. A rare soft-bodied fossil that was recovered from the Farmers Member of the Borden Formation (Mississippian age) in northeastern Kentucky was interpreted as a chondrophorine float and potential porpitids were described from the Carrara Formation (lower Cambrian) of California.

<text>General Richard Savage, 4th Earl Rivers PC (ca. 1654 – 18 August 1712) was an English nobleman and soldier who was a senior Army officer in the English and then British Army. The second son of Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers and his first wife Elizabeth Scrope, Savage was styled Viscount Colchester after the death of his elder brother Thomas in 1680, he was designated by that title until he succeeded to the peerage upon the death of his father, the 3rd Earl, in 1694. Savage served as Master-General of the Ordnance and Constable of the Tower, and was briefly commander-in-chief of the forces in lieu of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde until his death in 1712.

==Early life and career==
A member of the Savage family, Richard Savage was the second son of Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers. Early in life, Richard acquired notoriety as a rake and he would carry this reputation throughout his life, fathering several bastard children and being noted for his &#x27;dare-devilry and dissipation&#x27;. After becoming Viscount Colchester on his brother&#x27;s death he entered Parliament as member for Wigan in 1681 and procured a commission in the Horseguards under Sarsfield in 1686. Savage served as MP for Wigan until 1685. He was the first nobleman and one of the first persons who joined the Prince of Orange on his landing in England in November 1688, and he accompanied William to London. Savage later became the MP for Liverpool in 1689.

Obtaining promotion in the army, he served with distinction in the Williamite war in Ireland and in the Netherlands and was made Major-General in 1698 and Lieutenant-General in 1702. In 1694 he succeeded his father as 4th Earl Rivers and could no longer continue as a Member of Parliament, instead taking his father&#x27;s seat in the House of Lords. He served abroad in 1702 under Marlborough, who formed a high opinion of his military capacity and who recommended him for the command of a force for an invasion of France in 1706. The expedition was eventually diverted to Portugal, and Rivers, finding himself superseded before anything was accomplished, returned to England, where Marlborough procured for him a command in the cavalry.

The favour shown him by Marlborough did not deter Rivers from paying court to the Tories when it became evident that the Whig ascendancy was waning, and his appointment as constable of the Tower in 1710 on the recommendation of Harley and without Marlborough&#x27;s knowledge was the first unmistakable intimation to the Whigs of their impending fall. Rivers now met with marked favour at court, being entrusted with a delicate mission to the Elector of Hanover in 1710, which was followed by his appointment in 1711 as Master-General of the Ordnance, a post hitherto held by Marlborough himself.

In 1708, he became one of the first members to be sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom following the Acts of Union under Queen Anne.

==Personal life==
Jonathan Swift, who was intimate with Earl Rivers, speaks of him as an &#x27;arrant knave&#x27;; but the dean may have been disappointed at being unmentioned in Rivers&#x27;s will, for he made a fierce comment on the earl&#x27;s bequests to his mistresses and his neglect of his friends. In June 1712 Rivers was promoted to the rank of general, and became commander-in-chief in England; he died a few weeks later, on 18 August 1712.

He married in 1679 Penelope, daughter of Roger Downes, by whom he had a daughter Elizabeth, who married the 4th Earl of Barrymore. He also left several illegitimate children, two of whom were by Anne, Countess of Macclesfield. Rivers&#x27; intrigue with Lady Macclesfield was the cause of that lady&#x27;s divorce from her husband Charles Gerard, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield in 1701. Richard Savage, the poet, claimed identity with Lady Macclesfield&#x27;s son by Lord Rivers, but though his story was accepted by Dr Johnson and was generally believed, the evidence in its support is faulty in several respects. As Rivers left no legitimate son the earldom passed on his death to his cousin, John Savage, grandson of the 2nd earl, and a priest in the Roman Catholic Church, on whose death, about 1735, all the family titles became extinct.

<text>Epic theatre () is a theatrical movement that arose in the early to mid-20th century from the theories and practice of a number of theatre practitioners who responded to the political climate of the time through the creation of new political dramas. Epic theatre is not meant to refer to the scale or the scope of the work, but rather to the form that it takes. Epic theatre emphasizes the audience&#x27;s perspective and reaction to the piece through a variety of techniques that deliberately cause them to individually engage in a different way. The purpose of epic theatre is not to encourage an audience to suspend their disbelief, but rather to force them to see their world as it is.

== History ==

The term &quot;epic theatre&quot; comes from Erwin Piscator who coined it during his first year as director of Berlin&#x27;s Volksbühne (1924–27). Piscator aimed to encourage playwrights to address issues related to &quot;contemporary existence.&quot; This new subject matter would then be staged by means of documentary effects, audience interaction, and strategies to cultivate an objective response. Epic theatre incorporates a mode of acting that utilises what Brecht calls &quot;gestus&quot;. One of Brecht&#x27;s most-important aesthetic innovations prioritised &quot;function&quot; over the sterile dichotomous opposition between &quot;form&quot; and &quot;content&quot;. Epic theatre and its many forms is a response to Richard Wagner&#x27;s idea of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, or &quot;total artwork&quot;, which intends each piece of art to be composed of other art forms. Since epic theatre is so focused on the specific relationship between form and content, these two ideas contradict each other, despite the fact that Brecht was heavily influenced by Wagner. Brecht discussed the priorities and approach of epic theatre in his work &quot;A Short Organum for the Theatre&quot;. Although many of the concepts and practices involved in Brechtian epic theatre had been around for years, even centuries, Brecht unified them, developed the approach, and popularised it.

Near the end of his career, Brecht preferred the term &quot;dialectical theatre&quot; to describe the kind of theatre he pioneered. From his later perspective, the term &quot;epic theatre&quot; had become too formal a concept to be of use anymore. According to Manfred Wekwerth, one of Brecht&#x27;s directors at the Berliner Ensemble at the time, the term refers to the &quot;&#x27;dialecticising&#x27; of events&quot; that this approach to theatre-making produces.

Epic theatre is distinct from other forms of theatre, particularly the early naturalistic approach and later &quot;psychological realism&quot; developed by Konstantin Stanislavski. Like Stanislavski, Brecht disliked the shallow spectacle, manipulative plots, and heightened emotion of melodrama; but where Stanislavski attempted to engender real human behaviour in acting through the techniques of Stanislavski&#x27;s system and to absorb the audience completely in the fictional world of the play, Brecht saw this type of theatre as escapist. Brecht&#x27;s own social and political focus was distinct, too, from surrealism and the Theatre of Cruelty, as developed in the writings and dramaturgy of Antonin Artaud, who sought to affect audiences viscerally, psychologically, physically, and irrationally. While both produced &#x27;shock&#x27; in the audience, epic theatre practices would also include a subsequent moment of understanding and comprehension.

==Techniques==
===&quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;===
While not invented by Brecht, the &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot;, known in English as the &quot;estrangement effect&quot; or the &quot;alienation effect&quot;, was made popular by Brecht and is one of the most significant characteristics of epic theatre.

Some of the ways the &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; can be achieved is by having actors play multiple characters, rearrange the set in full view of the audience, and &quot;break the fourth wall&quot; by speaking to the audience. The use of a narrator in &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot; is another example of Verfremdungseffekt at work. Lighting can also be used to emulate the effect. For example, flooding the theatre with bright lights (not just the stage) and placing lighting equipment on stage can encourage the audience to fully acknowledge that the production is merely a production instead of reality.

As with the principle of dramatic construction involved in the epic form of spoken drama amalgamated or what Brecht calls &quot;non-Aristotelian drama&quot;, the epic approach to play production utilizes a montage technique of fragmentation, contrast and contradiction, and interruptions. While the French playwright Jean Genet articulates a very different world view in his dramas from that found in Brecht&#x27;s, in a letter to the director Roger Blin on the most appropriate approach to staging his &quot;The Screens&quot; in 1966, he advises an epic approach to its production:

===Historicisation===
Historicization is also employed in order to draw connections from a historical event to a similar current event. This can be seen in the plays &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; and &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot;, both written by Brecht, which comment on a current social or political issue using historical contexts.

Brecht, too, advised treating each element of a play independently, like a music hall turn that is able to stand on its own.
Common production techniques in epic theatre include a simplified, non-realistic scenic design offset against a selective realism in costuming and props, as well as announcements or visual captions that interrupt and summarize the action. Brecht used comedy to distance his audiences from the depicted events and was heavily influenced by musicals and fairground performers, putting music and song in his plays.

Acting in epic theatre requires actors to play characters believably without convincing either the audience or themselves that they have &quot;become&quot; the characters. This is called Gestus when an actor takes on the physical embodiment of a social commentary. Actors frequently address the audience directly out of character (&quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot;) and play multiple roles. Brecht thought it was important that the choices the characters made were explicit, and tried to develop a style of acting wherein it was evident that the characters were choosing one action over another. For example, a character could say, &quot;I could have stayed at home, but instead I went to the shops.&quot; This he called &quot;fixing the Not / But element&quot;.

<doc id="564798" wikidata="Q2701214" url="?curid=564798" title="Mormon (prophet)">
<text>Mormon is believed by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Community of Christ to be a prophet-historian and a member of a tribe of indigenous Americans known as the Nephites, one of the four groups (including the Lamanites, Jaredites, and Mulekites) described in the Book of Mormon as having settled in the ancient Americas.

According to the Book of Mormon, the prophet Mormon engraved an abridgement of his people&#x27;s history on golden plates. Based on the chronology described in the book, Mormon lived during the 4th century AD. As a narrator in the text, Mormon presents himself as a redactor. He quotes and paraphrases other writers, collects and includes whole texts by other authors, contributes running commentary, and also writes his own narrative. He writes about the process of making the book, both in terms of compiling the works of other prophets and also in terms of engraving the words on metal plates. He alludes to content that is left out of the book, and refers to a larger collection of records at his disposal.
The Book of Mormon states that Mormon was instructed by the prophet Ammaron where to find the records that had been passed down from their ancestors. It also says that Mormon later abridged the near-millennium-long history of his ancestors, and added additional revelations into the Book of Mormon. Divisions of the book relating to Mormon&#x27;s personal history are the Words of Mormon and the first seven chapters of the larger book. The book says that Mormon eventually passed all of the records on to his son Moroni.

==Life history==

According to Mormon&#x27;s record in the Book of Mormon, he was born to a father whose name was also Mormon, but was named &quot;after the land of Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among the people&quot;. At about the age of ten, he was visited by Ammaron and given instructions on where to find the sacred engravings of the Nephite prophets and what to engrave upon them. At the age of eleven, Mormon was taken to the land of Zarahemla by his father.

Mormon writes that at age fifteen he was visited by Jesus Christ.

In his &quot;sixteenth year,&quot; being young but &quot;large in stature&quot;, Mormon &quot;was appointed by the people of Nephi&quot; to be the leader of their armies, and fought against the Lamanites in many battles thereafter.

Mormon went to the hill Shim at about the age of 24, as instructed by Ammaron, to take and abridge the Nephite records.

Mormon writes that he &quot;utterly refuse[d]...to be a commander and a leader&quot; to the Nephites &quot;because of their wickedness and abomination&quot;. However, about thirteen years later, Mormon decided to return as commander of the Nephite armies as they were being badly beaten by the Lamanites.

Upon returning, Mormon again led them in battle against the Lamanites until the entire destruction of the Nephite nation, which took place as a result of a huge battle fought between the two groups in 385. As the last prophet and keeper of the record, Moroni is said to have become the angel or messenger who revealed the location of the golden plates to Joseph Smith in 1823.

Mormon witnesses the destruction of the Nephite people and their armies as they battle against the Lamanites (Mormon 6:1). 15 years later (Mormon 8), Moroni finishes his father&#x27;s record (Mormon 8:1) and mentions that his father was killed after the battle against the Lamanites at the Hill Cumorah (Mormon 8:3).

==Mormon as editor==
The emphasis of several themes in Helaman leads some scholars to draw conclusions about Mormon. Mormon is the narrator the Book of Mormon presents as the final editor of the latter part of the Book of Mormon called the Plates of Nephi, which includes Helaman. In an article published by Brigham Young University (BYU)&#x27;s Religious Studies Center, Thomas W. Mackay, a professor of classical and medieval studies at BYU, outlines Mormon&#x27;s philosophy of history. Mormon&#x27;s editorial decisions reveal his attitudes about history, life, and theology. Mormon chooses to include incidents that fulfill earlier prophecies, indicating that he wishes to call attention to them. Additionally, Helaman 12 contains a long digression from Mormon where he explicitly states that people tend to become rebellious, causing God to respond with punishment until they repent. Lacking more information about Nephite and Lamanite history, readers are left to come to a similar conclusion as Mormon based on the evidence he presents. Mormon states that Satan influenced the Nephites to create secret combinations like the Gadianton robbers.

==Meaning of the name==
Mormon scholar Hugh Nibley noted the prevalence of names in the Book of Mormon with the root &quot;mor&quot; and suggested that the root may be of Egyptian origin with the meaning of &quot;beloved&quot;. However, in the 15 May 1843 issue of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, Joseph Smith explained the name as being a contraction of the English word &quot;more&quot; and &quot;mon&quot;, a word that Smith claimed was Egyptian for &quot;good&quot;, making the name literally mean &quot;more good&quot;.

<doc id="564808" wikidata="Q336813" url="?curid=564808" title="Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan">
<text>Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan ( 1655 – 21 August 1693) was an Irish army officer. Killed at Landen in 1693 while serving in the French Royal Army, he is now best remembered as an Irish patriot and military hero.

Born into a wealthy Catholic family, Sarsfield began his military career during the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War. After fellow Catholic James II of England was deposed by the Glorious Revolution in November 1688, Sarsfield served as a senior commander in the Jacobite army during the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland, and was elected to the 1689 Patriot Parliament.

Fighting in Ireland ended with the 1691 Treaty of Limerick. Under the agreement, thousands of Irish soldiers went into exile in France, and many served in Flanders during the Nine Years&#x27; War. They included Sarsfield, who was fatally wounded at the Battle of Landen on 29 July 1693.

==Personal details==
Originally of English descent, the Sarsfield family were wealthy Catholic merchants, who settled in Dublin; Sir William Sarsfield was knighted in 1566, reportedly for providing the Crown financial support during Shane O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s rebellion. He purchased Lucan Manor, a large estate to the west of Dublin, and Tully Commandery in County Kildare.

Sarsfield&#x27;s father Patrick (c. 1628 – after 1693) married Anne O&#x27;Moore, daughter of Rory O&#x27;Moore, a Gaelic noble who played a leading part in the 1641 rebellion. This was emphasised by 19th-century writers seeking to bolster Sarsfield&#x27;s status as an Irish hero, although nationalist historian O&#x27;Callaghan claimed he was &quot;no better than a puffed Palesman&quot;, compared to figures such as Eoghan Ruadh Ó Néill.

During the 1641 to 1652 Irish Confederate Wars, his father fought for the Catholic Confederacy but belonged to the moderate faction that sought an agreement with Protestant Irish Royalists. Although his estates were confiscated in 1652, they were returned in 1662. His eldest son William married Mary Crofts, reputedly an illegitimate daughter of Charles II and younger sister of James Scott, Duke of Monmouth.

In 1689, Sarsfield married the 15-year-old Honora Burke (1674–1698), daughter of William Burke, 7th Earl of Clanricarde; they had one son, James Sarsfield, 2nd Earl of Lucan (1693–1719). After Sarsfield&#x27;s death, she married James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, eldest but illegitimate son of James II of England.

Catalina Sarsfield, who styled herself Queen of the brief-lived Kingdom of Corsica, is often cited as Sarsfield&#x27;s daughter. She was in fact a distant cousin; her father David Sarsfield came from another branch of the family, and was killed at the Battle of Villaviciosa in 1710.

==Early career: France and England==
There are few surviving records of Sarsfield&#x27;s early life, although it is generally agreed he was brought up on the family estates at Tully. While some biographies claim he was educated at a French military college, there is no evidence for this.

In the 1670 Treaty of Dover, Charles II agreed to support a French attack on the Dutch Republic, and supply 6,000 troops for the French army. When the Franco-Dutch War began in 1672, Sarsfield was commissioned into his brother-in-law Monmouth&#x27;s regiment, which formed part of this Brigade. Although England left the war in 1674, the Brigade continued to serve in the Rhineland, under Turenne. Sarsfield transferred into a regiment commanded by Irish Catholic Sir George Hamilton.

Sarsfield fought at Entzheim, Turckheim and Altenheim; he and Hamilton were standing next to Turenne when he was killed by a chance shot at Salzbach in July 1675. He remained in France until the war ended in 1678, then returned to London to join a new regiment being recruited by the Earl of Limerick. However, the Popish Plot then resulted in Sarsfield and other Catholics being barred from serving in the military.

This left him short of money, and Sarsfield became involved in an expensive legal campaign to regain Lucan Manor from the heirs of his brother William, who died in 1675. This ultimately proved unsuccessful amid allegations of forged documents, and in 1681 he returned to London, where he made two separate attempts to abduct an heiress and was lucky to escape prosecution. When Charles&#x27;s Catholic brother James became king in 1685, Sarsfield rejoined the army and fought in the decisive Battle of Sedgemoor, which ended the Monmouth Rebellion. James was keen to promote Catholics, whom he viewed as more loyal, and by 1688 Sarsfield was colonel of a cavalry unit.

After Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1687, he began creating a Catholic-dominated Irish army and political establishment. Aware of preparations for invasion by his nephew and son-in-law William of Orange, James sent Sarsfield to Dublin in September to persuade Tyrconnell to provide him with Irish troops. This proved unsuccessful, and in November James was deposed by the Glorious Revolution. Sarsfield took part in the Wincanton Skirmish, one of the few military actions during the invasion. he remained in England until January when he was allowed to join James in France.

==Williamite War in Ireland==
Accompanied by French troops and English exiles, James landed in Ireland in March 1689, beginning the Williamite War in Ireland. Sarsfield was promoted brigadier, elected to the 1689 Irish Parliament for County Dublin, and commanded cavalry units in the campaign in Ulster and Connacht. When an Irish brigade was sent to France in October, French ambassador D&#x27;Avaux proposed Sarsfield as its commander. He noted that while &quot;not...of noble birth [...], (he) has distinguished himself by his ability, and (his) reputation in this kingdom is greater than that of any man I know [...] He is brave, but above all has a sense of honour and integrity in all that he does&quot;.

James rejected this, stating that although unquestionably brave, Sarsfield was &#x27;very scantily supplied with brains.&#x27; His role at the Boyne was peripheral, although the battle was less decisive than often assumed, Jacobite losses being around 2,000 from a force of 25,000. James returned to France, leaving Tyrconnell in control; he was the leader of the &quot;Peace Party&quot;, who wanted to negotiate a settlement preserving Catholic rights to land and public office. Sarsfield headed the &quot;War Party&quot;, who felt they could gain more by fighting on; it included the Luttrell brothers, Nicholas Purcell and English Catholic William Dorrington, a former colleague from Monmouth&#x27;s Regiment.

The position of the War Party was strengthened by the Declaration of Finglas, which offered the rank and file amnesty but excluded senior officers. French victories in the Low Countries briefly increased hopes of a Stuart restoration, and the Jacobites established a defensive line along the Shannon. Sarsfield cemented his reputation with an attack on the Williamite artillery train at Ballyneety, widely credited with forcing them to abandon the first siege of Limerick. The Jacobites also retained Athlone, offset by the loss of Kinsale and Cork, which made resupply from France extremely difficult.

With Tyrconnell absent in France, Sarsfield took control and in December 1690, arrested several leaders of the peace faction. He then bypassed James by asking Louis XIV directly for French support, and requesting the removal of Tyrconnell and the army commander Berwick, James&#x27; illegitimate son. The latter, who later described Sarsfield as &quot;a man [...] without sense&quot;, albeit &quot;very good-natured&quot;, left Limerick for France in February.

Tyrconnell returned in January 1691, carrying letters from James making Sarsfield Earl of Lucan, an attempt to placate an &quot;increasingly influential and troublesome figure&quot;. A large French convoy arrived at Limerick in May, along with St Ruth, appointed military commander in an attempt to end the conflict between the factions. St Ruth and 7,000 others died at Aughrim in July 1691, reputedly the bloodiest battle ever on Irish soil. Sarsfield&#x27;s role is unclear: one account claims he quarrelled with St Ruth and was sent to the rear with the cavalry reserves.

The remnants of the Jacobite army regrouped at Limerick; Tyrconnell died of a stroke in August, and in October, Sarsfield negotiated terms of surrender. He has been criticised for this, having constantly attacked Tyrconnell for advocating the same thing, while it is suggested the Williamite army was weaker than he judged. However, the collapse of the Shannon line and surrender of Galway and Sligo left him little option; without French supplies, the military position was hopeless, and defections meant his army was dissolving.

The military articles of the Treaty of Limerick preserved the Jacobite army by allowing its remaining troops to enter French service; about 19,000 officers and men, including Sarsfield, chose to leave in what is known as the Flight of the Wild Geese. Sarsfield&#x27;s handling of the civil articles was less successful; most of its protections were ignored by the new regime, although Sarsfield may have viewed it as temporary, hoping to resume the war.

==Exile and death==
On arrival in France, Sarsfield became Major-General in the army of exiles, an appointment James made with great reluctance. In addition to other acts of perceived insubordination, Sarsfield allegedly told William&#x27;s negotiators at Limerick &quot;change but kings with us, and we will fight it over again&quot;. After the planned invasion of England was abandoned in 1692, the exiles became part of the French army, and Sarsfield a French &quot;marechal de camp&quot;.

He fought at Steenkerque in August 1692, and was fatally wounded at the Battle of Landen in 1693, dying at Huy three days later. Despite several searches, no grave or burial record has been found, although a plaque at St Martin&#x27;s church, Huy, has been set up in commemoration and an announcement in 2023 stated that, pending exhumation and identification, his remains had been located. Like much else, his reputed last words, &quot;Oh that this had been shed for Ireland!&quot;, are apocryphal.

==Legacy==

Sarsfield left few contemporary records, and those that exist are &quot;disconcertingly incomplete&quot;. It is impossible to determine his precise political views, almost nothing is known of his family life, and none of the alleged portraits of him can be authenticated. This allowed later writers to use him as a vehicle for their own needs, especially his portrayal as the &quot;heroic ideal of an Irish soldier&quot;.

His success at Ballyneety remains his most famous achievement, although a 1995 study suggests it had limited military value, and his men may have indiscriminately slaughtered women and children. He has also been criticised for the role he played in creating divisions within the Jacobite camp; senior officers considered him rash and easily manipulated, although he seems to have been popular with the rank and file.

Mythologising began during his lifetime; the poet Dáibhí Ó Bruadair, 1625 to 1698, composed a panegyric describing Sarsfield as virtuous, heroic, popular and a great leader, but admitted they had not met. The anonymous song &quot;Slán le Pádraig Sáirseál&quot;, or &quot;Farewell to Patrick Sarsfield&quot;, is considered a classic of Irish-language poetry. Nineteenth-century nationalists like Thomas Davis celebrated him as a national hero and patriot, while in the early 20th century he was also depicted as a staunch Catholic.

During the 1912 to 1914 Home Rule crisis, his image as a brave and honourable patriot was used to counter Unionist claims that Catholics, and by definition nationalists, were incapable of self-government. When the Irish Folklore Commission began collecting material in the 1930s, they recorded many oral narratives about Sarsfield, including stories of buried gold, generosity to the poor, having his horse shod backwards to escape from pursuers, and apparitions of dogs or white horses.

The global Irish diaspora meant his name and reputation were commemorated beyond Ireland; Michael Corcoran, a Federal general in the United States Civil War, claimed to be a direct descendant. From 1870 to 1880, a unit in the California National Guard formed from recruits of Irish descent was called the Sarsfield Grenadier Guards. Towns that bear his name include Sarsfield, Ontario, and Sarsfield in Victoria, Australia.

&quot;Sarsfield&quot; appears on the coat of arms for County Limerick; in Limerick itself, there is a Sarsfield Bridge and Sarsfield Street, while the local Irish Army base is Sarsfield Barracks. An 1881 bronze statue by sculptor John Lawlor stands in the grounds of St John&#x27;s Cathedral. Part of the route used for the attack on the Williamite siege train is marked out today as Sarsfield&#x27;s Ride, and is a popular walking and cycling route through County Tipperary, County Clare and County Limerick.

The song &quot;Jackets Green&quot; by Michael Scanlan is about a soldier fighting alongside Patrick Sarsfield in the Williamite war.

<text>In macroeconomics and finance, a transfer payment (also called a government transfer or simply fiscal transfer) is a redistribution of income and wealth by means of the government making a payment, without goods or services being received in return (in contrast to financial transaction). These kind of payments are one-sided in nature, i.e. one party enjoys economic benefits from the other party. These payments are considered to be non-exhaustive because they do not directly absorb resources or create output. Examples of transfer payments include welfare, financial aid, social security, and government subsidies for certain businesses.

Unlike the exchange transaction which mutually benefits all the parties involved in it, the transfer payment consists of a donor and a recipient, with the donor giving up something of value without receiving anything in return. Transfers can be made both between individuals and entities, such as private companies or governmental bodies. These transactions can be both voluntary or involuntary and are generally motivated either by the altruism of the donor or the malevolence of the recipient.

For the purpose of calculating gross domestic product (GDP) by expenditure method, government spending does not include transfer payments, which are the reallocation of money from one party to another rather than expenditure on newly produced goods and services.

== Criticism ==
A criticism of transfer payments is that they do not produce outcomes that are economically advantageous. Governments pool taxes and other sources of revenue together and spend the money to further a certain agenda. Some of the spending pays for goods and services, such as buildings, equipment, and government worker salaries. These expenditures are exchanges in which money is traded for something with a recognized value. The payments may be viewed as boosting industrial activity and employment. However, government transfer payments do not boost production or economic activity. For example, foreign aid does not necessarily prompt foreign trade. Additionally, some argue that welfare programs, such as unemployment benefits, reduce incentives to take paid work.

Furthermore, the macroeconomic effect of transfer payments is reduced in the lower income countries and regions/states. The reasons for such disparity are the following:

* the level of transfer payments is subject to the fiscal capacities of the administering entity 
* the size of transfer payments is generally dependent on the previous earnings of the beneficiary 
* largest share of transfer payments is typically administered to the older age groups, which constitute to a smallest share of population of the lower income countries, regions or states

== Methods of payment ==

=== Cash ===

More than 100 million people worldwide receive a government transfer payment. Examples of payments can be social aids to alleviate poverty or social insurance benefits by participating in social security systems. It is estimated that 90% of high-income nations make these payments via electronic transfer methods, whereas over half of the world&#x27;s developing countries utilizes paper payments such as cash or checks. Transfer payment via cash is the most popular method of transferring benefits to beneficiaries. However, cash transfer programs are constrained by three factors: financial resources, institutional capacity, and ideology, particularly in countries in the Global South. Many governments in poorer countries, where cash transfers could potentially have the most impressive impact, are often unwilling to implement such programmes due to fears of inflation and more importantly, dependency on the transfers.

=== In-kind transfer ===
In-kind transfer payments consist of individual goods and services provided to households by governmental bodies and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), which are either acquired on the market or produced as non-market output by governmental bodies or NPISHs.

The items included are:

* Other social security benefits in kind (e.g. food stamps)
* Social assistance benefits in kind
* Transfers of individual non-market goods or services

== Social security benefit ==
Primarily, social security benefits are designed to provide income continuity to those persons who have retired from labour force because of either inability to work (physical disability or mental trauma), to find employment or due to old age (retirement).

These include, but are not limited to:

* Unemployment compensations
* Old age insurance
* Civil service pensions
* State and local government pensions
* Survivors benefits
* Supplemental Security Income

== By country ==
===Australia===
In Australia, the horizontal fiscal imbalance arises because of the mismatch between the tax revenues and government expenses for the various state and territorial governments. This imbalance is addressed by a horizontal fiscal equalisation (HFE) policy overseen by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.

===Canada===

In Canada, Federal-Provincial transfers usually refer to a system of payments from the federal government to the provinces as part of Canada&#x27;s &quot;fiscal federalism&quot; through explicit and implicit redistribution. These transfers are intended to assist provinces with less fiscal capacity than others in providing comparable public services in all regions, including health and education. Transfers include explicit programs such as equalization payments, Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and the Canada Social Transfer (CST) (formerly the Canada Health and Social Transfer) and Territorial Formula Financing. There are also implicit transfers that result from federal taxation and spending decisions and policies.

Canada&#x27;s transfer payments originated in the British North America Act (1867)&#x27;s Sections 118 as provincial subsidies. By 1907, these payments were altered as new provinces joined the Dominion. In a 1957 arrangement, poorer provinces received annual payments: Prince Edward Island received $2.5 million and the three provinces, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick each received $7.5 million. These payments ended and were rolled into the 1967 equalization program intended to &quot;enable each province to provide an adequate level of public services without resort to rates of taxation substantially higher than those of other provinces.&quot;

In Canada, transfers payments are contentious and equalization formulas are often revised. Implicit transfers through federal taxation, for example, are greater in higher income provinces such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario and lower in provinces such as Manitoba, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces. Canada measures average fiscal capacity of each province which varies widely. Alberta is the highest at $12,577 per person and PEI is the lowest at $6,013 per person. In 2016 federal income tax in Alberta was more than $8,000 compared to less than $3,000 in PEI. All provinces pay the same federal tax rates.

Economist Trevor Tombe wrote that by 2018, transfer payments had become &quot;complex arrangements&quot; that are much larger than the original subsidies and are &quot;more equally distributed&quot;. By 2018, inter-provincial redistribution has decreased to less than 2% of Canada&#x27;s GDP, its lowest in 60 years. In the early 1980s it was 3.5%.

===China===

Since July 2011, existing regional and local social security schemes, including pooling arrangements, are gradually being unified under the country&#x27;s first national law on social transfer payments. The government aims to establish a comprehensive, equitable, and unified pension system that covers both urban and rural residents by 2020. In 2016, the government decided to establish a unified health insurance system for both rural and non-salaried urban residents. The government has also announced that medical insurance and maternity insurance programs will be merged.

===India===

India has four types of social transfer payments – old age and disability benefits, sickness and maternity benefits, work injury transfers, and unemployment benefits. Most sources of payments are employers (via provident funds), and the government.

===United States===

The U.S. still utilizes paper transfer payments in its Social Security administration as many recipients, particularly those in lower-income categories, are unbanked, i.e. do not have a bank account to facilitate direct deposits. However, the U.S. has been able to implement electronic transfer systems in its food stamps and education assistance programs.

<text>Thomas Grey, 2nd Earl of Stamford, PC (31 January 1720) was an English politician.

==Biography==
Grey was the only son of Thomas, Lord Grey of Groby, and inherited his title from his grandfather. His mother was Lady Dorothy Bourchier, daughter of Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath.

Grey took some part in resisting the arbitrary actions of James II, and was arrested in July 1685. After his release he took up arms on behalf of William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution, after whose accession to the throne he was made a Privy Counsellor (1694) and Lord Lieutenant of Devon (1696). Politically he was described as an &quot;unrepentant Whig&quot;, who reaffirmed his belief in the Popish Plot by voting against the motion to reverse the attainder on William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford.

In 1697 he became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and in 1699 President of the Board of Trade, being dismissed from his office upon the accession of Anne in 1702. From 1707 to 1711, however, he was again President of the Board of Trade.

He married twice: firstly in 1651, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Daniel Harvey (diplomat), ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (divorced), and secondly in 1691, Mary, daughter of Joseph Maynard, MP in the Cavalier Parliament. On his death without surviving children, his titles and Leicestershire estate at Bradgate Park passed to his first cousin Henry Grey, 3rd Earl of Stamford (1685–1739), a grandson of the first earl, from whom the later earls were descended.

==Arms==

The arms of the head of the Grey family are blazoned &quot;Barry of six argent and azure in chief three torteaux gules&quot;.

<doc id="564817" wikidata="Q1961674" url="?curid=564817" title="Kidlington">
<text>Kidlington is a village and civil parish in the Cherwell district of Oxfordshire, England. It is in-between the River Cherwell and Oxford Canal, north of Oxford and south-west of Bicester. It had a population of 13,600 at the 2021 Census.

==History==
Kidlington&#x27;s toponym derives from the Old English &quot;Cudelinga tun&quot;: the &quot;tun&quot; (settlement) of the &quot;Kidlings&quot; (sons) of Cydel-hence. The Domesday Book in 1086 records &quot;Chedelintone&quot;. By 1214 the spelling &quot;Kedelinton&quot; appears in a Calendar of Bodleian Charters. The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates from 1220, but there is evidence of a church on the site since 1073. St Mary&#x27;s has fine medieval stained glass and a spire known as &quot;Our Lady&#x27;s Needle&quot;. It is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a ring of eight bells. Richard III Chandler of Drayton Parslow, Buckinghamshire, cast the seventh bell in 1700. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the tenor bell in 1708 and the fifth bell in 1715. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble, second, third, fourth and sixth bells in 1897, the year of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

Behind the church are archaeological remains of a three-sided moat. St Mary&#x27;s Rectory is Tudor. Beside the church are almshouses built by Sir William Morton in 1671 in memory of his wife and children, whose names are inscribed above the windows. Sir William was a Royalist Commander in the Civil War and lived in nearby Hampden Manor in Mill Street. Other residents of Hampden Manor have included Sir John Vanbrugh, during the building of Blenheim Palace in Woodstock. The square tower-water closet in the front garden of Hampden Manor was built by Vanbrugh. It drains into a brook that now runs underground along Mill Street into the nearby Cherwell. Thomas Beecham formulated his pills while living in a cottage near the manor and worked for a time as a gardener for John Sydenham.

The settlement listed in Domesday grew from an ancient village close to the church. It has as many 18th-century Georgian buildings as modern houses. Until the &quot;&quot; (50 Geo. 3. c. clviii]]) was implemented in 1818, a large area south of it was unenclosed common land and the village widely known as Kidlington-on-the-Green. The land was built up as a garden city just before the Second World War. In the 1920s and 1930s, Kidlington was subject to ribbon development along the main (now A4260) road through the village. Since 1945 many housing estates have been built behind this on both sides. Oxford Zoo was once located in Kidlington, where the Thames Valley Police headquarters now stands. It was open only from 1931 to 1937, when the animals were transferred to Dudley Zoo. In 2018, an elephant sculpture was installed on a roundabout at the southern end of Kidlington to commemorate the zoo and an elephant that lived there.

In the 20th century, Kidlington grew to be a contender for largest village in England (even in Europe), with a population of 13,723, compared with 1,300 in 1901. Its residents have so far resisted efforts to change its official status to a town, though it clearly qualifies as such. After a peremptory change by the Parish Council to town status in November 1987, this was voted down by 83 per cent three months later in a ballot of the local electorate.

In June 2016, the BBC reported weekly coachloads of sightseers from China arriving on Benmead Road, Kidlington, who were seen posing for photos in front gardens and against parked cars, with no apparent reason for their interest. The story attracted worldwide interest, with Kidlington locals offering interviews about their experience. In November 2016, after analysing results of a Chinese-language questionnaire given to some tourists, the BBC found that &quot;looking for the true sense&quot; of Britain was one reason for the visits. An investigative journalist found that in fact Chinese tour operators charge $68 extra for Chinese-language tours of nearby Blenheim Palace. Tourists who do not want to pay to visit Blenheim are dropped off in Kidlington, which they find charming, but which tour operators select because it is too far from Blenheim to enable tourists to walk to the Palace and pay the cheaper £25 price for public tours in English.

==Railways==

Kidlington&#x27;s railway station opened near Langford Lane in 1852 as Woodstock Road Station on the Great Western Railway. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. A branch line was added between Kidlington and Woodstock in 1890 and a new Blenheim and Woodstock railway station built at Woodstock, renaming Woodstock Road as Kidlington Station. British Railways closed the station in 1964. The building remained into the 1980s. From the 1980s onwards it has been Oxfordshire County Council policy to open a new station on land between Flatford Place and Thorne Close on Lyne Road. This has yet to happen.

At Water Eaton, south of the centre of Kidlington, there was a railway halt at on the former Varsity Line. The halt was opened by the London and North Western Railway in 1905 and closed by its successor, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1926. In October 2015 Chiltern Railways and Network Rail opened a new Oxford Parkway railway station near the site of the former Oxford Road Halt with trains every 30 minutes between London Marylebone via and and .

Kidlington has about 50 shops, banks and building societies, a public library, a large village hall and a weekly market. There are seven pubs, two cafes and four restaurants. The pubs along the main A4260 through the village are, from north to south, the &quot;Highwayman Hotel&quot; (originally the &quot;Anchor&quot;, then the &quot;Railway Hotel&quot;, then the &quot;Wise Alderman&quot;, before being renamed again in 2009), the &quot;Black Horse&quot;, the &quot;Black Bull&quot; and the &quot;Red Lion&quot;, with the &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot; in the Moors and the &quot;Six Bells&quot; in Mill Street. The &quot;Squire Bassett&quot; was converted into a Nepalese restaurant and renamed the Gurkha Village in 2012. Ovisher Tandoori in Kidlington&#x27;s main Oxford Road is one of Oxfordshire&#x27;s longest-running Indian restaurants. There is a secondary school (Gosford Hill) and a handful of primary schools to deal with the expanding population. Recently Gosford Hill School started a narrow-band radio show for its pupils.

====Proposed Oxford United stadium====
In 2022, Oxford United asked Oxfordshire County Council to transfer hectares (44.48 acres) of land for the development of a new 18,000 capacity football stadium with ancillary leisure and commercial facilities to include, hotel, retail, conference, and training/community grounds on Green Belt land at Stratfield Brake near Kidlington. On 18 January 2022, OCC recommended an engagement exercise be carried out first to gather feedback from the local community. Among local residents, 38 per cent were in favour, whilst 58 per cent were against.

In February 2023, Oxford United unveiled plans to build a new &#x27;all-electric&#x27;, 16,000-seat stadium, to open in 2026, on the Triangle site in Kidlington. OCC&#x27;s cabinet had consented to lease the proposed site to the club. South of Kidlington roundabout, the site is east of the Stratfield Brake site, being situated between Frieze Way and Oxford Road, with proposed pedestrian access from Oxford Parkway railway station. The club&#x27;s architect, AFL, submitted its full planning application for the scheme on 1 March 2024. In June 2024, a decision on the application was postponed to 2025 to allow further work on the proposals to &quot;provide further clarity&quot; for the planning committee.

===Rugby===
The Gosford All Blacks rugby union team, founded on 15 May 1956, takes its name from the New Zealand All Blacks team, which toured in that season. It remains based in Kidlington. The first team plays in the Berks, Bucks &amp; Oxon Premier League. When founded, the club used the Gosford Hill School pitch and facilities. The &quot;King&#x27;s Arms&quot;, the Moors, became its headquarters. In May 1959 the club moved to Langford Lane and in December 1962 became the youngest club to acquire its own clubhouse, after the neighbouring airport donated a hangar for the purpose. Gosford All Blacks held the county rugby shield in the 2011–12 season.

===Cricket===
Kidlington Cricket Club, founded in 1837, used to play in the &quot;Oxford Times&quot; Cherwell Cricket League, but in January 2009 the League voted to expel it for alleged breaches of rules which were never proven. In the 2010 season, the club began to play in the Oxfordshire Cricket Association (OCA) league, After a league merger, Kidlington now play in the Cherwell League again with 3 sides. 

===Motor racing===
For 1976 to 1998, Kidlington was home base for a motor racing team, Tom Walkinshaw Racing, founded by the Scottish driver Tom Walkinshaw. It raced cars that included the Rover Vitesse, Mazda RX-7, Jaguar XJS and Holden Commodore, while acting as the factory-backed Jaguar team in sports car racing and touring car racing. It went on to win several championships, including the World Sportscar Championship, the European and the British Touring Car Championships, and some high-profile races, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the Spa 24 Hours and the Bathurst 1000.

<doc id="564818" wikidata="Q7790196" url="?curid=564818" title="Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby">
<text>Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby (c. 16231657), was an elected Member of Parliament for Leicester during the English Long Parliament, an active member of the Parliamentary party and a regicide. He was the eldest son of Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford, using his father&#x27;s as his own courtesy title, and Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter.

In January 1643, during the First English Civil War he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the Parliament in the Midland Counties and Governor of Leicester. In 1648 he won some credit for his share in the pursuit and capture of the Duke of Hamilton; he assisted Colonel Pride in purging the Parliament by helping to identify members to be excluded. Later in 1648, he was made commissioner of the court which tried King Charles I. His signature on the death warrant indicates that he was a strong advocate for the execution of the King, because he signed after the President of the court John Bradshaw and before Oliver Cromwell, who was third to sign out of a total of fifty nine commissioners (judges). Grey was the only person of nobility to sign the death warrant.

A member of the Council of State under the Commonwealth, Lord Grey of Groby fought against the Scots in 1651 during the Third English Civil War. A supporter of the Good Old Cause, in February 1655 during the Protectorate he was arrested on suspicion of conspiring against Cromwell who was by now Lord Protector, but he was, however, soon released. He predeceased his father in April or May 1657.

==Early life==
Thomas Grey was born in 1623 to Henry Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Groby and Anne Cecil daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter. He spent most of his youth in the Bradgate House, construction of which was begun by a late ancestor of his; Sir John Grey of Groby, and in Groby Manor. In 1628 Thomas at the age of five acquired the courtesy title of Lord Grey of Groby when his father was created the 1st Earl of Stamford. At the age of either 10 or 11, his family entertained Charles I and his wife Henrietta Maria of France in the Bradgate House. The royal visit was an event that marked a rise within the family fortune. Yet fortune would soon turn on the Grey household. The family, having issues with failed business aspirations and also with both local and national policy, began to turn against the king in 1634. Furthering the rift with the Monarchy was the family&#x27;s Puritan history. By 1640 a 17-year-old Thomas Grey was in a world where tensions were growing rapidly on a national scale. With the English Civil War looming, in 1641 Grey was elected a Member of Parliament for Leicester in the House of Commons and was admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn like his father before him. He was also later that same year selected among twelve other members of the same committee to present the Grand Remonstrance and petition to the Monarchy. The petition was in protest to the King for &quot;Oppressions in Religion, Church Government and Discipline.&quot; For his actions in the committee he was referred to as &quot;a Lord dear to the House of Commons&quot;.

==Military career==
On 16 January 1643, Thomas, Lord Grey of Groby was appointed commander-in-chief of the midland counties association and then ordered to take special care of Nottingham during the second Civil War. He took up headquarters there in June 1643, with a force of approximately 6,000 men. In a letter to his son Thomas, dated 5 March 1643, Henry Grey (Thomas&#x27; father) describes a battle to sweep the country, going through such towns as Lutterworth, Hinckley, Barwell, Lichfield, and Newark. On 29 August 1643, at Aylesbury, he joined the Earl of Essex on the march to relieve Gloucester. After the siege was raised, he fought at the first battle of Newbury for which he received thanks. In 1644, he received more appreciation for the reduction of places in Derbyshire. He then left Leicester due to a misunderstanding but was, in 1645, petitioned back to meet a royalist attack. In 1648, Lord Grey raised troops in Leicestershire. After the defeat of the Scots at Preston, he pursued the Duke of Hamilton and his horse to Uttoxeter and took credit for his capture, though Duke Hamilton claimed he surrendered. Until August, Grey held various commands in the militia. In 1651, he was sent to raise volunteers with the commission of commander-in-chief in the counties of Leicester, Nottingham, Northampton and Rutland, to meet the Scottish invasion. In September, Sir Edward Massie surrendered to Lord Grey after the battle of Worcester.

==Regicide==
By end of the year 1643, Grey&#x27;s views began to diverge from his father&#x27;s moderate ideas and in 1644 he left Leicester because of misunderstanding with the county. In 1645 Lord Grey was forced to give up command by the Self-Denying Ordinance of April 1645 and it was after this that he entered a political alliance with radical and republican politicians, also petitioning to meet the royalist attack. On 6 December 1648 Lord Grey assisted with Pride&#x27;s Purge (pointing out &#x27;obnoxious&#x27; members who were to be removed from the house), he was also a supporter of the Leveller Cause. On 16 February 1649 he served as one of the Judges against King Charles I, after which he gained notoriety as regicide. Grey was the second of the 59 regicides to sign and the only aristocrat to sign the death warrant which resulted in King Charles&#x27;s execution on 30 January 1649.

==Imprisonment and death==
In 1649 he became the Counselor of State and was nominated for Council of State until an ambiguous disgrace. In 1653, he became disenchanted with Oliver Cromwell because he dissolved the Rump and on 12 February 1655 Grey joined the Fifth Monarchists. He was arrested on suspicion by Colonel Hacker, acting on Protector&#x27;s orders, and despite being &quot;much distempered with gout&quot; was taken prisoner at Windsor Castle. In July 1655 he was released following an application to the Protector. However, from his release until his death in 1657 he took no active part in politics.

==Family==
On 4 June 1646, at the age of 23, Lord Grey married Dorothy, daughter of Edward Bourchier, 4th Earl of Bath. In 1654, their only son Thomas was born, who would succeed his grandfather to the Earldom of Stamford.

==Arms==

The arms of the head of the Grey family are blazoned &quot;Barry of six argent and azure in chief three torteaux gules&quot;.

<doc id="564821" wikidata="Q1894494" url="?curid=564821" title="Numero sign">
<text>The numero sign or numero symbol,  (also represented as Nº, No̱, №, No., or no.), is a typographic abbreviation of the word &quot;number&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) indicating ordinal numeration, especially in names and titles. For example, using the numero sign, the written long-form of the address &quot;Number 29 Acacia Road&quot; is shortened to &quot;№ 29 Acacia Rd&quot;, yet both forms are spoken long.

Typographically, the numero sign combines as a single ligature the uppercase Latin letter with a usually superscript lowercase letter, sometimes underlined, resembling the masculine ordinal indicator . The ligature has a code point in Unicode as a precomposed character, .

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; derives the numero sign from Latin , the ablative form of (&quot;number&quot;, with the ablative denotations of &quot;by the number, with the number&quot;). In Romance languages, the numero sign is understood as an abbreviation of the word for &quot;number&quot;, e.g. Italian , French , and Portuguese and Spanish .

This article describes other typographical abbreviations for &quot;number&quot; in different languages, in addition to the numero sign proper.

==Usages==
The numero sign&#x27;s non-ligature substitution by the two separate letters and is common. A capital or lower-case &quot;n&quot; may be used, followed by &quot;o.&quot;, superscript &quot;o&quot;, ordinal indicator, or the degree sign; this will be understood in most languages.

===Bulgarian===

In Bulgarian the numero sign is often used and it is present in three widely used keyboard layouts accessible with in BDS and prBDS and with on the Phonetic layout.

===English===
In English, the non-ligature form is typical and is often used to abbreviate the word &quot;number&quot;. In North America, the number sign, , is more prevalent. The ligature form does not appear on British or American QWERTY keyboards.

===French===
The numero symbol is not in common use in France and does not appear on a standard AZERTY keyboard. Instead, the French Imprimerie nationale recommends the use of the form &quot;no&quot; (an &quot;n&quot; followed by a superscript lowercase &quot;o&quot;). The plural form &quot;nos&quot; can also be used. In practice, the &quot;o&quot; is often replaced by the degree symbol (°), which is visually similar to the superscript &quot;o&quot; and is easily accessible on an AZERTY keyboard.

===Indonesian and Malaysian===
&quot;Nomor&quot; in Indonesian and &quot;nombor&quot; in Malaysian; therefore &quot;No.&quot; is commonly used as an abbreviation with standard spelling and full stop.

===Italian===

The sign is usually replaced with the abbreviations &quot;n.&quot; or &quot;nº&quot;, the latter using a masculine ordinal indicator, rather than a superscript &quot;O&quot;.

===Philippine languages===
Because of more than three centuries of Spanish colonisation, the word &quot;número&quot; is found in almost all Philippine languages. &quot;No.&quot; is its common notation in local languages as well as English.

===Portuguese===
In Portugal, the similar-looking notation is often used. In Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language, is often used on official documents. In both cases, the symbol used () is the masculine ordinal indicator. However, the Brazilian National Standards Organization (ABNT) determines that the word &quot;número&quot; should be abbreviated &quot;n.&quot; only.

===Russian===

Although the letter is not in the Cyrillic alphabet, the numero sign is typeset in Russian publishing, and is available on Russian computer and typewriter keyboards.

The numero sign is very widely used in Russia and other post-Soviet states in many official and casual contexts. Examples include usage for law and other official documents numbering, names of institutions (hospitals, kindergartens, schools, libraries, organization departments and so on), numbering of periodical publications (such as newspapers and magazines), numbering of public transport routes, etc.

 (&quot;&quot;, &quot;sequential number&quot;) is universally used as a table header to denote a column containing the table row number.

The sign is sometimes used in Russian medical prescriptions (which according to the law must be written in Latin language) as an abbreviation for the Latin word &quot;numero&quot; to indicate the number of prescribed dosages (for example, tablets or capsules), and on the price tags in drugstores and pharmacy websites to indicate number of unit doses in drug packages, although the standard abbreviation for use in prescriptions is the Latin 

===Spanish===
The numero sign is not typically used in Iberian Spanish, and it is not present on standard keyboard layouts. According to the Real Academia Española and the Fundéu BBVA, the word &quot;número&quot; (number) is abbreviated per the Spanish typographic convention of &quot;letras voladas&quot; (&quot;flying letters&quot;). The first letter(s) of the word to be abbreviated are followed by a period; then, the final letter(s) of the word are written as lowercase superscripts. This gives the abbreviations n.o (singular) and n.os (plural). The abbreviation &quot;no.&quot; is not used (it might be mistaken for the Spanish negative word &quot;no&quot;). The abbreviations nro. and núm. are also acceptable. The numero sign, either as a one-character symbol or composed of the letter N plus superscript &quot;o&quot; (sometimes underlined or substituted by the ordinal indicator, ), is common in Latin America, where the interpolated period is sometimes not used in abbreviations.

===Nr.===
In some languages, &quot;Nr.&quot;, &quot;nr.&quot;, &quot;nr&quot; or &quot;NR&quot; is used instead, reflecting the abbreviation of the language&#x27;s word for &quot;number&quot;. In German, which capitalises all nouns and abbreviations of nouns, the word &#x27; is abbreviated as &quot;Nr.&quot; Lithuanian uses this spelling as well, and it is usually capitalised in bureaucratic contexts, especially with the meaning &quot;reference number&quot; (such as &#x27;, &quot;contract No.&quot;) but in other contexts it follows the usual sentence capitalisation (such as &quot;tel. nr.&quot;, abbreviation for &quot;&quot;, &quot;telephone number&quot;). It is commonly lowercase in other languages, such as Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Estonian and Swedish. Some languages, such as Polish, omit the dot in abbreviations if the abbreviation ends with the last letter of the original word.

==Typing the symbol==

The sign is encoded in Unicode as and many platforms and languages have methods to enter it. See Unicode input and the relevant keyboard articles for further details.

<doc id="564822" wikidata="Q5722225" url="?curid=564822" title="Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford">
<text>Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford ( 1599 – 21 August 1673), known as the Lord Grey of Groby from 1614 to 1628, was an English nobleman and military leader. He was the eldest son of Sir John Grey and Elizabeth Nevill. His mother was probably a daughter of Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny (died 1622) and his wife Rachel Lennard.

Henry succeeded his paternal grandfather, Henry Grey, 1st Baron Grey of Groby, as second Baron Grey of Groby in July 1614. His paternal grandmother was Anne Windsor, youngest daughter of William Windsor, 2nd Baron Windsor and his first wife Margaret Sambourne.

His great-grandfather Lord John Grey of Pirgo was son of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset and younger brother of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk.

==Life and career==

Henry Grey matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1615, and was granted an M.A. that year, during the visit of King James I of England. He married Lady Anne Cecil, daughter of William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter by his second wife, Elizabeth Drury. Lady Anne Cecil was the heiress of the borough and manor of Stamford. In March 1628, Henry was created Earl of Stamford. Just before the outbreak of the English Civil War, he was included as one of the opponents of King Charles I of England, and was made lord lieutenant of Leicestershire. After some operations around Leicester, he occupied Hereford, and when compelled to abandon the city, marched to Cornwall.

At the Battle of Stratton, on 16 May 1643, his troops were beaten by the Royalists; driven into Exeter, the Earl of Stamford was forced to surrender the city after a siege of three months. He was certainly no general, and was charged with cowardice. He took no further part in the military operations of the war, although once or twice he was employed on other businesses.

The ravages of the Royalists had reduced him to poverty, and distrusted by the House of Commons, he had great difficulty in getting any compensation from Parliament. After a period of retirement, he declared for King Charles II of England during a rising in August 1659, and was arrested but soon released. Henry Grey died on 21 August 1673; his earldom passed to his grandson, Thomas Grey, 2nd Earl of Stamford.

==Children==
Henry had at least nine children with Lady Anne Cecil, they were:
*Lady Elizabeth Grey (born ). She married George Booth, 1st Baron Delamer and was the mother of Henry Booth, 1st Earl of Warrington.
*Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby ( – 1657), Member of Parliament for Leicester.
*Lady Diana Grey (before 1631 – 8 April 1689). She married Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin and was the mother of Thomas Bruce, 3rd Earl of Elgin.
*Anchitell Grey (died 1702), the compiler of the &quot;Debates of the House of Commons, 1667-1694&quot; (10 vols, 1769).
*John Grey. He married Lady Catherine Ward, daughter of Edward Ward, 7th Baron Dudley and Frances Brereton. They were parents of Harry Grey, 3rd Earl of Stamford.
*Lady Jane Grey. Married into the Ogle family.
*Leonard Grey. Believed to have died young, but in fact, as he moved to France, his whereabouts were lost. There he married Anne Durand. Leonard died , very likely in Paris.
*Lady Anna Grey
* Lady Mary Grey. Believed to have died young.
* Robert Grey he married Hannah Holt in Salem Mass.

==Arms==

The arms of the head of the Grey family are blazoned &quot;Barry of six argent and azure in chief three torteaux gules&quot;.

<text>Aetokremnos is a rock shelter near Limassol on the southern coast of Cyprus. It is widely considered to host some of the oldest evidence of human habitation of Cyprus, dating to around 12,000 years ago. It is situated on a steep cliff site c. above the Mediterranean sea. The name means &quot;Cliff of the eagles&quot; in Greek. Around have been excavated and out of the four layers documented, the third is sterile.

== Discovery ==
The site, which is located on a British Royal Air Force base, was discovered in 1960 by an anonymous amateur, who reported the find to Stuart Swiny (director of the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute in Nicosia). Swiny noted the existence of flint artifacts and a large number of hippo bones and that much of the site had eroded into the Mediterranean. Subsequent study and excavation of the site was conducted by Swiny and other archaeologists.

== Archaeology ==

The site contains mainly bones of the Late Pleistocene endemic Cyprus Dwarf Hippopotamus (&quot;Hippopotamus minor&quot;), which are represented by the remains of over 370 individuals a much lesser amount of the Cyprus dwarf elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon cypriotes&quot;) representing the remains of at least 3 individuals, and artifacts (c. 1,000 flints including thumbnail scrapers of the Mesolithic type), which resemble those produced by the Natufian culture of the mainland Levant. There are no bones that show marks of butchery, but an unusually high frequency (30%) of burned bones. The pygmy hippos make up c. 74% of the bones, followed by fish remains (25%) and birds, mainly bustards. The presence of fallow deer (4 bones) and pig (13 bones) is puzzling, since these animals are thought to have been introduced only in the Neolithic period.

According to the excavators, hearth remains are found in the layer containing the bone beds of the extinct megafauna. This would make it the oldest site on the island and evidence of Epipalaeolithic occupation. The original 31 radiocarbon dates put the date of the bones at c. 12,500 years BP. and suggest a short-term occupation. These dates have been challenged as the excavators considered the nine bone dates to be the least reliable and did not agree with the dates of the stratigraphy where they were found. As of 2013 there are now 36 radiocarbon dates of which 13 were taken from animal bones (pig and hippo). A 2013 report states that even discarding these and relying on the other 23 determinations on charcoal, sediment and shell &quot;we reaffirm our original interpretation of a relatively short occupation of some 300 years centered around 11,775 years BP, with a range of 11,652 to 11,955 years BP at one standard deviation, or 11,504 to 12,096 years BP at two standard deviations. This is in general accord with Manning’s (2013:501 to 503) masterful compilation of all early Cypriot radiocarbon determinations, in which he places Aetokremnos within an approximate 12,950 to 10,950 years BP range while also preferring a somewhat longer occupation than we presented.&quot;

There are other deposits with bones of pygmy elephants and hippopotami on the island, but these do not contain artifacts.

The origin of the bones at the site is disputed. Some authors have suggested that the bones were accumulated at the site by humans, while other authors contend that the age distribution curve of the hippotamus bones suggests that the bones accumulated naturally at the site over hundreds of years, and the burnt bones are the result of later fires lit in the rockshelter by humans following their arrival to Cyprus, by which time the bones were already several centuries old.

<text>The Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Classical is an honor presented to record producers for quality classical music productions at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Originally known as the Grammy Award for Classical Producer of the Year, the award was first presented to James Mallinson at the 22nd Grammy Awards (1980). The name remained unchanged until 1998, when the category became known as Producer of the Year, Classical. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented to album producers &quot;whose recordings, released for the first time during the eligibility year, represent consistently outstanding creativity in the production of classical recordings&quot;. Producers must have produced at least 51% playing time on three separately released recordings (only one of which can be an opera released in DVD format). Producers may submit content as a team only if they worked together exclusively during the period of eligibility. 
Anthony Tommasini, music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, asserted that &quot;In the struggling field of classical recording, it&#x27;s the producers who take the real risks and make things happen.&quot; The honor is presented alongside the award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical.

As of 2023, David Frost, Steven Epstein, Robert Woods and Judith Sherman share the record for most wins, with seven each. while James Mallinson and Elaine Martone have been presented the award three times. Two-time recipients include Joanna Nickrenz (once alongside Marc Aubort). David Frost is the son of Thomas Frost, who received an award in the same category in 1987.

<doc id="564830" wikidata="Q543694" url="?curid=564830" title="Jet (gemstone)">
<text>Jet is a type of lignite, the lowest rank of coal, and is a gemstone. Unlike many gemstones, jet is not a mineral, but is rather a mineraloid. It is derived from wood that has changed under extreme pressure.

The English noun &quot;jet&quot; derives from the French word for the same material, (modern French ), ultimately referring to the ancient town of Gagae. Jet is either black or dark brown, but may contain pyrite inclusions which are of brassy colour and metallic lustre. The adjective &quot;&quot;, meaning as dark a black as possible, derives from this material.

==Origin==
Jet is a product of decomposition of wood from millions of years ago, commonly the wood of trees of the family Araucariaceae. Jet is found in two forms, hard and soft. Hard jet is the result of carbon compression and salt water; soft jet may be the result of carbon compression and fresh water. Despite the name they both occupy the same area of the Mohs scale with the difference being that soft jet is more likely to crack when exposed to changes in temperature.

==Properties==
Jet is around 75% carbon and 12% oxygen with sulfur and hydrogen making up most of the balance. Other elements are found at trace level and the exact ratios varying with the source; for example, Spanish jet contains more sulfur than Whitby jet. Jet has a Mohs hardness ranging between 2.5 and 4 and a specific gravity of 1.30 to 1.34. The refractive index of jet is approximately 1.66. The touch of a red-hot needle should cause jet to emit an odour similar to coal.

Jet may induce an electric charge like that of amber when rubbed.

Jet is very easily cut using carving tools, but small pieces tend to break off, making it difficult to create fine details. It therefore takes an experienced lapidarist to execute more elaborate carvings.

==Location==

===England===
The jet found at Whitby, in England, is the &quot;Jet Rock&quot; unit of the Mulgrave Shale Member, which is part of the Whitby Mudstone Formation. This jet deposit was formed approximately 181 million years ago, during the Toarcian age of the Early Jurassic epoch. Whitby Jet is the fossilized wood from species similar to the extant Chilean pine (&quot;Araucaria araucana&quot;). The deposit extends throughout North York Moors National Park.

Jet has also been found in Kimmeridge shale seams in Dorset.

===France===
Jet was mined from a number of areas of France including Montjardin and Roquevaire. Raw jet was also imported from Spain. In the 18th century there was a jet working industry based around Sainte-Colombe-sur-l&#x27;Hers and La Bastide-sur-l&#x27;Hers but this declined with the start of the 19th. An 1871 plan to import raw French jet into Whitby was unsuccessful due to its poor quality.

===Spain===
The jet found in Asturias, the biggest deposit in northern Spain, is of Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) age, about 155 million years old. Asturian jet is a perhydrous coal that suffered an anomalous coalification process and presents great material stability over long periods of time. At the end of the Middle Ages, the trade of religious objects and amulets made of jet reached great development in Santiago de Compostela, with sales to pilgrims traveling the Camino de Santiago. However, the deposits were in Asturias, where simple objects such as beads and rosary beads were also made. Santiago de Compostela was the main sales point and the location of the workshops that produced artistic objects. Jet has also been extracted in the area of Utrillas, Gargallo, and Montalbán in the province of Teruel, although it is of lower quality than that from Asturias.

===United States===
Native American Navajo and Pueblo tribes of New Mexico were using regionally mined jet for jewelry and the ornamentation of weapons when early Spanish explorers reached the area in the 1500s. Today these jet deposits are known as Acoma jet, for the Acoma Pueblo. Enormous coal deposits characterize the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and this geology is closely related to jet deposits mined in the Henry Mountains of Utah and the Front Range of El Paso County, Colorado.

===Other locations===
Jet is also commercialized in Poland and near Erzurum in Turkey, where it is known as oltu stone and is used to make prayer beads.

==History==

The earliest known worked jet object is a 10,000 BC model of a botfly larva, from Baden-Württemberg, Germany, found among the Venuses of Petersfels.

Jet has been used in Britain since the Neolithic period It continued in use in Britain through the Bronze Age where it was used for necklace beads. Jet necklaces following the plate and spacer design may have been based on Gold lunula. During the Iron Age jet went out of fashion until the early 3rd century AD in Roman Britain. The end of Roman Britain marked the end of jet&#x27;s ancient popularity.

Early archaeologists (particularly Victorian) often failed to distinguish between jet and other jet-like materials In particular in southern Britain the material described as jet was often Kimmeridge Shale. and some artifacts use more than one jet-like material. For example, the Pen y Bonc necklace combines two or three jet pieces with other dark material.

===Roman use===
Whitby jet was a popular material for jewellery in Roman Britain from the 3rd century onward. There is no evidence for Roman jet working in Whitby itself, rather it was transferred to Eboracum (modern York) where considerable evidence for jet production has been found. The collection of jet at this time was based on beachcombing rather than quarrying. It was used in rings, hair pins, beads, bracelets, bangles, necklaces, and pendants, many of which can be seen in the Yorkshire Museum. Jet rings tended to follow the styles of existing metal rings although there were exceptions. Jet pendants were carved cameo style with Medusa head being a popular theme.

Stylistic similarities with jet items found in the Rhineland, and lack of any evidence for local manufacture, suggest that Eboracum-produced items were exported to that area. One item that has been found around the Rhine but not in Britain are jet bracelets that feature grooves with gold inserts.

The Roman period saw its use as a magical material, frequently used in amulets and pendants because of its supposed protective qualities and ability to deflect the gaze of the evil eye. Pliny the Elder suggests that &quot;the kindling of jet drives off snakes and relieves suffocation of the uterus. Its fumes detect attempts to simulate a disabling illness or a state of virginity.&quot; It has been referenced by other ancient writers including Solinus and Galen.

===Viking use===
Vikings made some use of jet including rings and miniature sculptures of animals with snakes being a prominent theme. The source of the jet has not been confirmed although Whitby is the most likely possibility.

===Medieval===

Medieval jet use appears to have been largely limited to religious items such as crosses and Rosary beads. During the period there was a belief that water drunk from jet bowls could help with labour. A jet bowl held in the Museum of London may have been designed to allow for this.

Jet became a valued costume accessory in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, owned jet buttons and clothes embroidered with jet beads. Elizabeth I bought 1000 &quot;black jet bugle drops&quot; to embroider headdresses in 1587. Anne of Denmark ordered a gown of &quot;double burret&quot; silk in June 1597 loaded with jet passementerie and 360 jet buttons. The gown was too heavy to wear and she ordered it to be remade with less jet.

===Victorian use===
Jet as a gemstone became fashionable during the reign of Queen Victoria. It originally became fashionable in the 1850s after the queen wore a necklace of it as part of mourning dress for Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Later the Queen wore Whitby jet as part of her mourning dress while mourning the death of Prince Albert.

In some jewellery designs of the period jet was combined with cut steel.

Jet use was at its highest in the early 1870s and from there it declined. From above 1000 workers in the trade Whitby was down to 300 by 1884. While jet substitutes may have had an impact this appears to have been in a large part due to changes in fashion with Art Nouveau making little use of black jewellery. As the numbers fell the remaining manufactures tended to stick with existing styles rather than attempting to adapt to new fashions resulting in demand falling further. Making tourist trinkets kept a few jewellers in work, but by the end of World War II only three remained, and the industry died out completely with their deaths.

===20th century===

In Whitby the Victorian tradition continued up until the aftermath of World War II. Jet jewellery (both vintage and new) was then to remain out of fashion until the late &#x27;70s. In the &#x27;80s there was a fashion for jet beads and antique jet jewellery started to rise in value. New jewellers took up the production of jet jewellery.

==Jet substitutes==
Glass was used as a jet substitute during the peak of jet&#x27;s popularity. When it was used in this way it was known as French jet or Vauxhall glass. Ebonite was also used as a jet substitute and initially looks very similar to jet, but it fades over time. In some cases jet offcuts were mixed with glue and molded into jewelry.

Anthracite (hard coal) is superficially similar to fine jet, and has been used to imitate it. This imitation is not always easy to distinguish from real jet.

Some museums have produced reproductions of jet artefacts in epoxy resin.

==Authenticating jet==
Unlike black glass, which is cool to the touch, jet is not cool, due to its lower thermal conductivity. When rubbed against unglazed porcelain, true jet will leave a brown streak, although bog oak, vulcanite, and lignite will do the same.

When non destructive testing is required, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, combined with visual inspection (including under high magnification) and X-ray imaging, is generally effective, although it can be difficult to differentiate jet from lignite.

Real jet, when placed in a flame, burns like coal and gives off a coal-like smell and produces soot. No other black &quot;gemstone&quot; behaves like this.

<text>The Honolulu Advertiser was a daily newspaper published in Honolulu, Hawaii. At the time publication ceased on June 6, 2010, it was the largest daily newspaper in Hawaii. It published daily with special Sunday and Internet editions.

&quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; was the parent publisher of &quot;Island Weekly&quot;, &quot;Navy News&quot;, &quot;Army Weekly&quot;, &quot;Ka Nupepa People&quot;, &quot;West Oahu People&quot;, &quot;Leeward People&quot;, &quot;East Oahu People&quot;, &quot;Windward People&quot;, &quot;Metro Honolulu People&quot;, and &quot;Honolulu People&quot; small, community-based newspapers for the public.

&quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; has had a succession of owners since it began publishing in 1856 under the name the Pacific Commercial Advertiser. On February 25, 2010, Black Press, which owned the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, purchased &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; from Gannett Pacific Corporation, which acquired the &quot;Advertiser&quot; in 1992 after it had sold the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; to another publisher that later sold it to Black Press in 2000. On May 3, 2010, a new company set up by Black Press, HA Management, took over operations of the &quot;Advertiser&quot; and merged it with the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; on June 7, 2010, to form the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;.

==History==
===Henry M. Whitney===

Businessman and son of Congregational missionaries, Henry M. Whitney founded the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; in 1856, a weekly newspaper that was circulated primarily in the whaling port of Honolulu. The inaugural edition was published on July 2 of that year with this statement from Whitney: 
Thank Heaven, the day at length has dawned when the Hawaiian nation can boast a free press, untrammeled by government patronage or party pledges, unbiased by ministerial frowns or favors.

The new publication had four pages with five columns, and a clear division into thematic sections. The last page was in Hawaiian and titled &quot;Ka Hoku Loa Hawaii&quot; (The Morning Star of Hawaii). The first issue of &quot;PCA&quot;, as the weekly was quickly nicknamed, had a print run of 600 copies and was produced on a hand press.

The biggest story in the first edition was a report on the wedding of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. However, the front page was devoted almost exclusively to advertisements. Throughout the paper, Whitney posted fifty-two advertisements for sailing ships in port at Honolulu Harbor with three hundred vessel timetables. In 1870, Whitney went broke and was forced to sell the &quot;Commercial Advertiser&quot; to James Black and William Auld, local printers. Whitney stayed on as the newspaper&#x27;s editor.

===Claus Spreckels===
In 1880, Black and Auld sold the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; to cabinet minister Walter M. Gibson, who was generally under financial control of Claus Spreckels. John Edward Bush, who was minister of the interior at the time, arranged for a government loan, and a guarantee of all government printing contracts.
Vehemently opposed to Spreckels&#x27;s conservative and pro-monarchy political stance, Whitney, as a devout annexationist, resigned as editor. In his place, Wallace Rider Farrington, future Governor of the Territory of Hawaii, arrived from Maine to become the new editor. Spreckels&#x27;s royalist slant in his editorial articles were deplored by many of the American businessmen residing in Hawaii at the time. Revenue suffered as a result, forcing Spreckels to eventually sell the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot;.

===Lorrin A. Thurston and Son===
In 1888, Spreckels sold his newspaper to the Hawaiian Gazette Company. It in turn sold the newspaper in 1898 to Lorrin A. Thurston. Thurston was organizer of the Hawaiian League, which had forced King Kalākaua to agree to the &quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot; of 1887 backed by the Honolulu Rifles armed militia, and make Thurston a cabinet minister. The 1887 constitution stripped the monarchy of most authority, took away many rights of native Hawaiians to vote in elections, and granted voting rights to American residents, even those who did not have citizenship in the kingdom. Thurston had been instrumental to the overthrow of the monarchy and the end of the existence of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

In 1921, Thurston changed the name of the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; to &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. The following year, Thurston hired Raymond S. Coll to be the newspaper editor. Coll served in that capacity until his retirement in 1959.

In 1931, Lorrin P. Thurston took over his father&#x27;s position as editor and president of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. He would later become chairman of the Hawaii Statehood Commission. Upon Raymond Coll&#x27;s retirement, Thurston hired George Chaplin, former editor of the military newspaper &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot;, as the editor of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. He would serve in this capacity for 28 years.

===Thurston Twigg-Smith and George Chaplin===
In 1961, Thurston Twigg-Smith continued family ownership as he inherited &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; from his uncle. He remained publisher and president until 1986. With the coupling of Chaplin and Twigg-Smith, &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; shifted its political slant from a staunchly conservative pro-Big Five newspaper to become a more moderate, racially progressive newspaper. Both were enormously influenced by the rising local Chinese American, Filipino American and Japanese American readership and worked to cater to these communities&#x27; news interests. In 1967, Twigg-Smith formed the Persis Corporation (known as Asa Hawaii Corporation until 1978) as the &quot;Advertiser&quot;&#x27;s parent company.

===Gannett Pacific Corporation===
In 1992, &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; was purchased by the Gannett Pacific Corporation, a subsidiary of Gannett Company Incorporated. It became the first morning edition publication in Gannett&#x27;s corporate history. The company had already owned Honolulu&#x27;s other major newspaper, the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, since 1973. From 1962 to 2001, both dueling newspapers were administered under a joint operating agreement under which they shared printing and advertising operations but kept separate editorial staff and printing functions. The agreement ended when the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; was sold to a separate company.

===Acquisition by Black Press and merger===
On February 25, 2010, Black Press, which owned the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, purchased &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. As part of the deal to acquire the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, Black Press agreed to place the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; on the selling block. If no buyer came forward by March 29, 2010, Black Press started making preparations to operate both papers through a transitional management team and then combine the two dailies into one.

On March 30, 2010, three parties came forward with offers to buy the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot;, but a month later on April 27, 2010, the bids were rejected because their bids for the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; was below the minimum liquidation price. Black Press canceled the sale as a result and proceeded with transition plans, which came on the same day that they were approved to take over the &quot;Advertiser&quot; by the Department of Justice.

On May 3, 2010, a new company set up by Black Press, HA Management, took over the operations of the paper while Black Press continued overseeing the Star-Bulletin during a 30- to 60-day transition period, in which both papers merged into one daily, &quot;The Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;. The &quot;Advertiser&quot; published its final edition at 12:01 AM on June 6, 2010, and Black Press officially launched the Honolulu Star-Advertiser as a broadsheet morning daily on June 7, 2010.

The newspaper will be based out of the former &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; offices at Restaurant Row and published at the former &quot;Advertiser&quot; printing facilities in Kapolei. A total of 474 staffers are employed at the daily, 265 from the &quot;Advertiser&quot; and 209 from &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot;. The fonts still use the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; masthead but with &quot;Advertiser&quot; replacing the &quot;Bulletin&quot; name.

==Advertiser Building==
&quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot; staff occupied the Advertiser Building on 605 Kapiolani Boulevard in downtown Honolulu up until its last day of business on June 4, 2010, and the final pressing of its June 6, 2010, issue. It was built in 1929 by the architectural firm Emory &amp; Webb in the beaux arts style. From the 1930s through the 1950s the building&#x27;s roof sported two radio towers with the transmitting antenna of AM radio station KGU strung between them.

Although Gannett sold the Advertiser in May 2010, the building that housed the newspaper was not immediately offered for sale as it was expected to be sold to a different party in the future. Employees and staff moved over to the &quot;Star-Advertiser&quot; offices at Restaurant Row and to the Kapolei facility, leaving the building vacant except for a small crew to remove most of the equipment and items in preparation for its sale.

The Advertiser Building has been used as a soundstage and housed small studios for &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot;.

<text>Honolulu Weekly was an alternative weekly newspaper published in Honolulu, Hawaii. Founded by Laurie V. Carlson, it began publishing in the summer of 1991, ostensibly to fill gaps in investigative reporting left by the two main dailies, &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; and &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;, which were under a joint operating agreement at the time, but creating new gaps in taste and perspective. In May 2005 the &quot;Weekly&quot; acquired the Kona-based &quot;Hawaii Island Journal&quot;. The Hawaii Island Journal published its last issue on Friday, June 13, 2008. The Honolulu Weekly published its final issue on June 5, 2013, and ceased operations. Publisher Carlson cited low ad revenues and the failure to find a buyer as among the primary reasons for shutting the paper down.

<text>Mărțișor () is a tradition celebrated at the beginning of Spring in March, involving an object made from two intertwined red and white strings with hanging tassel. It is practiced in Romania and Moldova, and very similar to Martenitsa tradition in Bulgaria, &quot;Martinka&quot; in North Macedonia and traditions of other populations from Southeastern Europe.

The word &quot;Mărțișor&quot; is the diminutive of &quot;marț&quot;, the old folk name for March (&quot;martie&quot;, in modern Romanian), and literally means &quot;little March&quot;. The tradition originates from the Roman celebration of the New Year on 1 March.

Modern tradition involves wearing the small object on the chest like a brooch or a lapel pin, during the first part of the month, starting from 1 March. Some older traditions held it should be worn from the first new moon of March until next significant holiday for the local community, which could be anywhere between 9 March and 1 May, or until first tree flowers blossomed, depending on the area. It was also more commonly worn tied around the wrist or like a necklace.

Nowadays a &quot;Mărțișor&quot; is made from silk strings, almost exclusively red and white. Before the 19th century various other colors were used: black and white in Mehedinți and in Aromanian communities, red only in Vâlcea, Romanați, Argeș, Neamț, and Vaslui, black and red in Brăila, white and blue in Vrancea, or even multiple colours in areas of southern Transylvania and Moldova. Likewise, the material used could have been wool, linen, cotton, or silk.

Charms were attached to the strings, mostly coins, usually silver, or cross pendants. Later these ornaments were shaped to resemble various images such as four-leaf clover, ladybug, snowdrop etc. Bulgarian Martenitsa models the tassel into small dolls called Pizho and Penda. In Moldova the pendant started being made in the shape of ethnographic objects in the later part of the 20th century.

General explanations have been given by the observers of the tradition for the object&#x27;s appearance: the strings are believed to represent &quot;funia anului&quot; - the year&#x27;s &quot;rope&quot;, intertwining summer and winter, the pendant symbolized fortune and wealth, or, like a talisman, brought and preserved good health and beauty to the wearer.

== The tradition ==

The custom of gifting and wearing the &quot;Mărțișor&quot; is a nationwide tradition among Romanians, Moldovans, and Aromanians. Similar customs include the &quot;Martenitsa,&quot; celebrated by Bulgarians, and &quot;Martinka&quot; by Macedonians, while other communities such as Albanians, Turks from the Ohrid region, Greeks from Northern Greece, the isles of Rhodes, Dodecanese and Karpathos, the Gagauz people, and the Diaspora of these populations also practice local variations of the custom.

The object was worn primarily by children and women, less so by men, and rarely by old people. Almost each region had a different time frame for how long it should be kept, varying from 2–3 days in the Iași region of Moldavia, up to 2–3 months in the Vâlcea region of Oltenia. Very often the end of this period was associated with signs of spring in the natural world: the return of migratory birds such as swallows and white storks, the flowering of fruit trees (apple tree, cherry tree), the blossoming of roses, or with the next significant holiday in the calendar.

When the object is removed, it is customary to tie it to a branch of a tree or place it on a fence as a gift for migratory birds returning from the south. Less commonly north of the Danube, but often recorded in Dobruja, was the practice of leaving the &quot;Mărțișor&quot; under a rock, with the type of insects found on the spot being interpreted as omens, throwing it into a spring or river (Gorj), or even burning it. In modern times they are often kept as souvenirs.

The tradition is placed along with other spring celebrations marking the year&#x27;s cycle: agricultural communities associated it with the end of winter and start of spring. In particular it is connected to the days of &quot;Baba Dochia&quot;, a mythological figure in Romanian folklore, and March, which in antiquity was the start of the year.

<doc id="564846" wikidata="Q6507082" url="?curid=564846" title="Slack-key guitar">
<text>Slack-key guitar (from Hawaiian &quot;kī hōalu&quot;, which means &quot;loosen the [tuning] key&quot;) is a fingerstyle genre of guitar music that originated in Hawaii. This style of guitar playing, which has been used for centuries, involves altering the standard tuning on a guitar from E-A-D-G-B-E, so that strumming across the open strings will then sound a harmonious chord, typically an open major. This requires altering (usually loosening) or &quot;slacking&quot; certain strings, which is the origin of the term &quot;slack key&quot;. The style typically features an alternating-bass pattern, played by the thumb on the lower two or three strings of the guitar, while the melody is played by the fingers on the three or four highest strings. There are as many as fifty tunings that have been used in this style of playing, and tunings were once guarded fiercely and passed down as family secrets. In the early 20th century, the steel guitar and the ukulele gained wide popularity in America, but the slack-key style remained a folk tradition of family entertainment for Hawaiians until about the 1960s and 1970s during the second Hawaiian renaissance. 

==History==

In the oral-history account, the style originated from Mexican cowboys in the early 19th century. These &quot;paniolo&quot; (a Hawaiianization of &quot;españoles&quot;—&quot;Spaniards&quot;) provided guitars, taught the Hawaiians the rudiments of playing, allowing the Hawaiians to develop the style on their own. Musicologists and historians suggest that the story is more complicated, but this is the version that is most often offered by Hawaiian musicians. Slack-key guitar adapted to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the harmonic structures of Hawaiian music. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the music as &quot;liquid, rippling, and hypnotic&quot;. The style of Hawaiian music that was promoted as a matter of national pride under the reign of King David Kalākaua in the late 19th century combined rhythms from traditional dance meters with imported European forms (for example, military marches), and drew its melodies from chant (&quot;mele&quot; and &quot;oli&quot;), hula, Christian hymns (&quot;hīmeni&quot;), and the popular music brought in by the various peoples who came to the Islands: English-speaking North Americans, Mexicans, Portuguese, Filipinos, Puerto Ricans, Tahitians, and Samoans.

The music did not develop a mainland audience during the Hawaiian music craze of the early 20th century, during which Hawaiian music came to be identified outside the Islands with the steel guitar and the ukulele. Slack key remained private and family entertainment, and it was not even recorded until 1946–47, when Gabby Pahinui cut a series of records that brought the tradition into public view. During the 1960s and particularly during the Hawaiian Cultural Renaissance of the 1970s, slack key experienced a surge in popularity and came to be seen as one of the most genuine expressions of Hawaiian spirit, principally thanks to Gabby Pahinui, Atta Isaacs, Leonard Kwan, Sonny Chillingworth, Raymond Kāne, and the more modern styles of younger players such as Keola Beamer, his brother Kapono Beamer, Peter Moon, and Haunani Apoliona. During this period, luthiers such as the Guitar and Lute Workshop in Honolulu specialized in the development and manufacture of guitars custom made to order for slack-key performance.

Many prominent Hawaii-based players got their starts during the Cultural Renaissance years: Cindy Combs, Ledward Kaapana, George Kahumoku, Jr., his brother Moses Kahumoku, Dennis Kamakahi, Ozzie Kotani, three Pahinui brothers (Bla, Cyril, and Martin), the Emerson Brothers and Owana Salazar. These artists, and slack key in general, have become well known outside Hawaii largely through George Winston&#x27;s Dancing Cat Records record label, which has most often showcased the music in solo settings.

One indication of slack key&#x27;s increasing visibility beyond the Islands is that the first four winners of the Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album were slack key collections: &quot;Slack Key Guitar, Volume 2&quot; in 2005, &quot;Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar, Volume 1&quot; in 2006, &quot;Legends of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar—Live from Maui&quot; and &quot;Treasures of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar – Live in Concert from Maui.&quot; Players from outside Hawaii have also taken up the tradition, for example, Chet Atkins (who included slack key pieces on two of his albums), Yuki Yamauchi (a student of Raymond Kāne&#x27;s and an advocate of Hawaiian music in Japan), pianist George Winston, and Canadian Jim &quot;Kimo&quot; West (perhaps better known as guitarist with &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic).

==Techniques and tunings==

George Winston has identified fifty slack-key tunings. Some are only commonly used for a single song, or by particular players. Mike McClellan and George Winston have developed similar schemes that organize the tunings by key and type. The chart below follows their categories and naming conventions. The tunings were often passed down in families from generation to generation, and tunings were often guarded as fiercely as any trade secret.

&quot;Kī hōalu&quot; often uses an alternating-bass pattern, usually played by the thumb on the lower two or three strings of the guitar, while the melody is played on the three or four highest strings, using any number of fingers. Many &quot;kī hōalu&quot; players incorporate various embellishments such as harmonics (chimes), the hammer-on, the pull-off, slides, and damping. Slack key compositions exhibit characteristics from indigenous Hawaiian and imported musical traditions. The vamp or turnaround (a repeated figure, usually at the end of a verse) is descended from the hula tradition, and other harmonic and structural features are descended from &quot;hīmeni&quot; and from the &quot;hula kui&quot; encouraged by King David Kalakaua.

Nearly all slack key requires retuning the guitar strings from the standard EADGBE, and this usually means lowering or &quot;slacking&quot; three or more strings. The result is most often a major chord, although it can also be a major seventh chord, a sixth, or (rarely) a minor. There are examples of slack key played in standard tuning, but the overwhelming majority of recorded examples use altered tunings. The most common slack-key tuning, called &quot;taro patch,&quot; makes a G major chord. Starting from the standard EADGBE, the high and low E strings are lowered or &quot;slacked&quot; to D and the fifth string from A down to G, so the notes become DGDGBD. As the chart below shows, there are also major-chord tunings based on C, F, and D.

Another important group of tunings, based on major-seventh chords, is called &quot;wahine&quot;. G wahine, for example, starts with taro patch and lowers the third string from G to F, making DGDFBD. Wahine tunings have their own characteristic vamps (as in, for example, Raymond Kāne&#x27;s &quot;Punahele&quot; or Gabby Pahinui&#x27;s 1946 &quot;Hula Medley&quot;) and require fretting one or two strings to form a major chord. A third significant group is Mauna Loa tunings, in which the highest pair of strings are a fifth apart: Gabby Pahinui often played in C Mauna Loa, CGEGAE.

<text>The GIPF Project is a series of seven abstract strategy games by designer Kris Burm.

The series is named after the first game, &quot;GIPF&quot;. All the games take place on some form of hexagonal board. Each of the games, including &quot;GIPF&quot;, may be played individually. When playing a standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot; the game is played with normal pieces and &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces. 

However, the series also allows players to link the &quot;GIPF&quot; game to the other games in the series or even to any game at all. It does this by introducing into the game of &quot;GIPF&quot; certain new pieces with special powers, called &quot;potentials&quot;. Before you start a game of &quot;GIPF&quot; with potentials, the players decide to which game they link each potential piece. For example, the &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; potential piece to a game of &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; and the &quot;DVONN&quot; potential to a game of &quot;DVONN&quot;. But they could decide just as well to link the ZÈRTZ potential to a coin flip and the &quot;DVONN&quot; potential to a dice roll. Now, when playing the GIPF game with potentials, they can introduce potential pieces whenever they like (according to the playing rules). As soon as they want to use the special power of one of their potential pieces during the &quot;GIPF&quot; game, they put the &quot;GIPF&quot; board aside and play the game linked to that specific potential piece (in the example above &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; and &quot;DVONN&quot;, respectively a coin flip and a dice roll). Upon victory the active player can use the power of the potential piece in the game of &quot;GIPF&quot;. If the active player loses, the special power of the potential piece cannot be used in the &quot;GIPF&quot; game.

The idea of introducing additional games that can be used to affect the outcome of the main game came from Burm&#x27;s childhood, when he and his brother would &quot;race&quot; cars around a rug. For each turn, they would play another game, and the winner of that game would get to roll six dice to determine his car&#x27;s movement, while the loser would roll just five.

, &quot;YINSH&quot;, &quot;TZAAR&quot;, &quot;DVONN&quot;, &quot;LYNGK&quot;, &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot;, &quot;GIPF&quot;, and &quot;PÜNCT&quot; are, respectively, the 3rd, 8th, 11th, 19th, 20th, 35th, and 80th highest ranked Abstract Games on Boardgamegeek. &quot;TAMSK&quot;, which was officially removed from the series, is nevertheless ranked 87th. &quot;YINSH&quot;, &quot;DVONN&quot;, and &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; have each won the Mensa Select award.

== List of games in the series ==
*&quot;GIPF&quot; (1996) is a game of pushing.
*&quot;TAMSK&quot; (1998) is a game of time (replaced by &quot;TZAAR&quot;).
*&quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; (1999) is a game of sacrifice.
*&quot;DVONN&quot; (2001) is a game of towers.
*&quot;YINSH&quot; (2003) is a game of flipping.
*&quot;PÜNCT&quot; (2005) is a game of connection.
*&quot;TZAAR&quot; (2007) is a game of capture and stacking (replacing &quot;TAMSK&quot;).
*&quot;LYNGK&quot; (2017) is a game of networking.
*&quot;MATRX GIPF&quot; is a combining some elements of the previous games. The game is in development and release has been announced for late 2024.

The games are based on elements: &quot;TAMSK&quot; (time), &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; (water), &quot;DVONN&quot; (fire), &quot;YINSH&quot; (air), &quot;TZAAR&quot; (earth), and &quot;PÜNCT&quot; (the interconnectivity of the brain). These elements are brought together in &quot;GIPF&quot;.

Most of the games in the series can be played free online (for example, at BoardSpace.net) or against freely available computer opponents.

== Different type of &quot;potentials&quot; ==

* The GIPF piece - Strictly speaking the &quot;GIPF&quot; piece belongs to the standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot; and is as such not a potential piece (i.e. it is not linked or linkable to any other game, it special power may be used without winning any other game). However it could be considered a normal piece with a special power in the game of &quot;GIPF&quot;. So conceptually speaking it &quot;could&quot; be considered a &quot;GIPF&quot; potential. 
* The TAMSK potential - As &quot;TAMSK&quot; is a game of time, this potential piece grants an additional move to its owner winning him some time in the &quot;GIPF&quot; game. (Remember: it is impossible to gain extra moves in a standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot;). 

* The ZÈRTZ potential - In &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; marbles leap over adjacent marbles to capture them. The &quot;ZÈRTZ&quot; potential piece allows to leap over an adjacent piece in the &quot;GIPF&quot; game (remember: leaping over other pieces is not allowed in a standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot;).

* The DVONN potential - &quot;DVONN&quot; is a game of stacking pieces. The &quot;DVONN&quot; potential piece allows the active player in the &quot;GIPF&quot; game to stack his potential piece on top an opponents normal piece and a such changing the color of the piece of his opponent (remember: stacking is not allowed in a standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot;) 

* The YINSH potential - In &quot;YINSH&quot; the players move their pieces over one or more empty spaces as long as they move in a straight line. The &quot;YINSH&quot; potential piece allows a player to move similarly in &quot;GIPF.&quot; When the &quot;YINSH&quot; potential is activated in &quot;GIPF&quot;, the active player can move a piece over one or more empty spaces (remember: pieces are move to the first empty space on the board in a standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot;).

* The PÜNCT potential - &quot;PÜNCT&quot; is a game about covering pieces of the opponent with your own pieces. The &quot;PÜNCT&quot; potential allow the active player to slides his potential piece on top of the &quot;PÜNCT&quot; potential of your opponent or on top of one of his &quot;GIPF&quot; pieces (remember: sliding on top of an opponents piece is not allowed in a standard game of &quot;GIPF&quot;). 

* The TZAAR potential - Designer Kris Burm declared that there will be no &quot;TZAAR&quot; potential. Please note that &quot;TZAAR&quot; is replacing &quot;TAMSK&quot; in the &quot;GIPF&quot; Project. The &quot;TAMSK&quot; potential suits well with the game &quot;TZAAR&quot;. In &quot;TZAAR&quot; the players have each turn the option to perform a second move or not. 

* The LYNGK potential - Designer Kris Burn declared that there will be no &quot;LYNGK&quot; potential.

* The MATRX GIPF potential - No news yet about any additional potential pieces. However the &quot;MATRX GIPF&quot; game will contain the above potentials.

== Origin of the names of the games ==
&quot;GIPF&quot; derives from the German word for a mountain summit (&quot;Gipfel&quot;), where the original game was conceived.

Subsequent games were named to include one vowel and 4 consonants, but to otherwise remain unrelated to existing language. &quot;TZAAR&quot; is the only game deviating from these naming conventions, due to disputes with the game publisher.

<doc id="564854" wikidata="Q312539" url="?curid=564854" title="Diosdado Macapagal">
<text>Diosdado Pangan Macapagal Sr. (; September 28, 1910 – April 21, 1997) was a Filipino lawyer, poet and politician who served as the 9th President of the Philippines, serving from 1961 to 1965, and the sixth Vice President, serving from 1957 to 1961. He also served as a member of the House of Representatives, and headed the Constitutional Convention of 1970. He was the father of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who followed his path as President of the Philippines from 2001 to 2010.

Known as &quot;The Poor Boy From Lubao,&quot; he was a native of Lubao, Pampanga. Macapagal graduated from the University of the Philippines and University of Santo Tomas, both in Manila, after which he worked as a lawyer for the government. He first won the election in 1949 to the House of Representatives, representing the 1st district in his home province of Pampanga. In 1957, he became vice president under the rule of President Carlos P. Garcia, whom he later defeated in the 1961 election.

As president, Macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the growth of the Philippine economy. He introduced the country&#x27;s first land reform law, placed the peso on the free currency exchange market, and liberalized foreign exchange and import controls. Many of his reforms, however, were crippled by a Congress dominated by the rival Nacionalista Party. He is also known for shifting the country&#x27;s observance of Independence Day from July 4 to June 12, commemorating the day President Emilio Aguinaldo unilaterally declared the independence of the First Philippine Republic from the Spanish Empire in 1898. He stood for re-election in 1965 and was defeated by Ferdinand Marcos.

Under Marcos, Macapagal was elected president of the 1970 constitutional convention that would later draft what became the 1973 Constitution, though the manner in which the charter was ratified and modified led him to later question its legitimacy. He died of heart failure, pneumonia, and renal complications, in 1997, at the age of 86.

Macapagal was also a poet in the Spanish language, though his poetic oeuvre was eclipsed by his political biography.

==Early years==
Diosdado Macapagal was born on September 28, 1910, at Barrio San Nicolas 1st in Lubao, Pampanga. He was the third of five children in a poor family. His father was Urbano Romero Macapagal, a poet who wrote in the local Pampangan language, and his mother was Romana Pangan Macapagal, daughter of Atanacio Miguel Pangan (a former &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot; of Gutad, Floridablanca, Pampanga) and Lorenza Suing Antiveros. Urbano&#x27;s mother, Escolástica Romero Macapagal, was a midwife and schoolteacher who taught catechism.

Diosdado is a distant descendant of Don Juan Macapagal, a prince of Tondo, who was a great-grandson of the last reigning &quot;lakan&quot; of Tondo, Lakan Dula. He is also related to well-to-do Licad family through his mother Romana, who was a second cousin of María Vitug Licad, grandmother of renowned pianist, Cecile Licad. Romana&#x27;s own grandmother, Genoveva Miguel Pangan, and María&#x27;s grandmother, Celestina Miguel Macaspac, were sisters. Their mother, María Concepción Lingad Miguel, was the daughter of José Pingul Lingad and Gregoria Malit Bartolo.

Diosdado&#x27;s family earned extra income by raising pigs and accommodating boarders in their home. Due to his roots in poverty, Macapagal would later become affectionately known as the &quot;Poor Boy from Lubao&quot;. Diosdado was also a reputed poet in the Spanish language although his poetic work was eclipsed by his political career.

===Early education===

Macapagal excelled in his studies at local public schools, graduating valedictorian from Lubao Elementary School, and salutatorian at Pampanga High School. He finished his pre-law course at the University of the Philippines Manila, then enrolled at Philippine Law School in 1932, studying on a scholarship and supporting himself with a part-time job as an accountant. While in law school, he gained prominence as an orator and debater. However, he was forced to quit schooling after two years due to poor health and a lack of money.

Returning to Pampanga, he joined boyhood friend Rogelio de la Rosa in producing and starring in Tagalog operettas patterned after classic Spanish zarzuelas. It was during this period that he married his friend&#x27;s sister, Purita de la Rosa, in 1938. He had two children with de la Rosa, Cielo and Arturo.

Macapagal raised enough money to continue his studies at the University of Santo Tomas. He also gained the assistance of philanthropist Don Honorio Ventura, the secretary of the interior at the time, who financed his education. He also received financial support from his mother&#x27;s relatives, notably from the Macaspacs, who owned large tracts of land in barrio Sta. Maria, Lubao, Pampanga. After receiving his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1936, he was admitted to the bar, topping the 1936 bar examination with a score of 89.95%. He later returned to his alma mater to take up graduate studies and earn a Master of Laws degree in 1941, a Doctor of Civil Law degree in 1947, and a PhD in economics in 1957. His dissertation had &quot;Imperatives of Economic Development in the Philippines&quot; as its title.

===Early career===
After passing the bar examination, Macapagal was invited to join an American law firm as a practicing attorney, a particular honor for a Filipino at the time. He was assigned as a legal assistant to President Manuel L. Quezon in Malacañang Palace. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II, Macapagal continued working in Malacañang Palace as an assistant to President José P. Laurel, while secretly aiding the anti-Japanese resistance during the Allied liberation country from the Japanese.

After the war, Macapagal worked as an assistant attorney with one of the largest law firms in the country, &quot;Ross, Lawrence, Selph and Carrascoso&quot;. With the establishment of the independent Third Republic of the Philippines in 1946, he rejoined government service when President Manuel Roxas appointed him to the Department of Foreign Affairs as the head of its legal division. In 1948, President Elpidio Quirino appointed Macapagal as chief negotiator in the successful transfer of the Turtle Islands in the Sulu Sea from the United Kingdom to the Philippines. That same year, he was assigned as second secretary to the Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C. In 1949, he was elevated to the position of counselor on legal affairs and treaties, at the time the fourth-highest post in the Philippine Foreign Office.

==House of Representatives (1949–1957)==

On the urging of local political leaders of Pampanga province, President Quirino recalled Macapagal from his position in Washington to run for a seat in the House of Representatives representing the 1st district of Pampanga. The district&#x27;s incumbent, Representative Amado Yuzon, was a friend of Macapagal, but was opposed by the administration due to his support by communist groups. After a campaign that Macapagal described as cordial and free of personal attacks, he won a landslide victory in the 1949 election. He was re-elected in the 1953 election, and served as a representative in the 2nd and 3rd Congress.
At the start of the 1950 legislative session, the members of the House of Representatives elected Macapagal as chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and was given several foreign assignments. He was a Philippine delegate to the United Nations General Assembly multiple times, taking part in debates over communist aggression with Andrei Vishinsky and Jacob Malik of the Soviet Union. He also took part in negotiations for the U.S.-R.P. Mutual Defense Treaty, the Laurel–Langley Agreement, and the Japanese Peace Treaty. He authored the Foreign Service Act, which reorganized and strengthened the Philippine foreign service.

As a representative, Macapagal authored and sponsored several laws of socio-economic importance, particularly aimed at benefiting rural areas and the poor. Amongst the legislation that Macapagal promoted, was the Minimum Wage Law, Rural Health Law, Rural Bank Law, the Law on Barrio Councils, the Barrio Industrialization Law, and a law nationalizing the rice and corn industries. He was consistently selected by the Congressional Press Club as one of the Ten Outstanding Congressmen during his tenure. In his second term, he was named most outstanding lawmaker of the 3rd Congress.

==Vice presidency (1957–1961)==
In the May 1957 general elections, the Liberal Party drafted Congressman Macapagal to run for vice president as the running-mate of José Y. Yulo, a former speaker of the House of Representatives. Macapagal&#x27;s nomination was particularly boosted by Liberal Party president Eugenio Pérez, who insisted that the party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee have a clean record of integrity and honesty. While Yulo was defeated by Carlos P. Garcia of the Nacionalista Party, Macapagal was elected vice president in an upset victory, defeating the Nacionalista candidate, José B. Laurel, Jr., by over eight percentage points. A month after the election, he was chosen as the president of the Liberal Party.

As the first ever Philippine vice president to be elected from a rival party of the president, Macapagal served out his four-year vice presidential term as a leader of the opposition. The ruling party refused to give him a Cabinet position in the Garcia administration, which was a break from tradition. He was offered a position in the Cabinet only on the condition that he switch allegiance to the ruling Nationalista Party, but he declined the offer and instead played the role of critic to the administration&#x27;s policies and performance. This allowed him to capitalize on the increasing unpopularity of the Garcia administration. Assigned to performing only ceremonial duties as vice president, he spent his time making frequent trips to the countryside to acquaint himself with voters and to promote the image of the Liberal Party.

As president, Macapagal worked to suppress graft and corruption and to stimulate the Philippine economy.

==Presidency (1961–1965)==

In the 1961 presidential election, Macapagal ran against Garcia&#x27;s re-election bid, promising an end to corruption and appealing to the electorate as a common man from humble beginnings. He defeated the incumbent president with a 55% to 45% margin. His inauguration as the president of the Philippines took place on December 30, 1961. The chief justice of the Supreme Court administered the oath of office. The Bible that Macapagal used was later used by his daughter Gloria when she took her oath as Vice President in 1998 and as President in 2004.

* Republic Act No. 4180 – An Act Amending Republic Act Numbered Six Hundred Two, Otherwise Known As The Minimum Wage Law, By Raising The Minimum Wage For Certain Workers, And For Other Purposes.

===Domestic policies===
====Economy====
In his inaugural address, Macapagal promised a socio-economic program anchored on &quot;a return to free and private enterprise&quot;, placing economic development in the hands of private entrepreneurs with minimal interference.

Twenty days after the inauguration, exchange controls were lifted and the Philippine peso was allowed to float on the free currency exchange market. The currency controls were initially adopted by the administration of Elpidio Quirino as a temporary measure, but continued to be adopted by succeeding administrations. The peso devalued from to the U.S. dollar, and stabilized at to the dollar, supported by a stabilization fund from the International Monetary Fund.

To achieve the national goal of economic and social progress with prosperity reaching down to the masses, there existed a choice of methods. First, there was the choice between the democratic and dictatorial systems, the latter prevailing in communist countries. On this, the choice was easy as Filipinos had long been committed to the democratic method. With the democratic mechanism, however, the next choice was between free enterprise and the continuing of the controls system. Macapagal stated the essence of free enterprise in layman parlance in declaring before Congress on January 22, 1962, that &quot;the task of economic development belongs principally to private enterprise and not to the government.

Before independence there was free enterprise in the Philippines under Presidents Manuel Quezon, Sergio Osmeña and Manuel Roxas. In 1950, President Elpidio Quirino deviated from free enterprise launching as a temporary emergency measure the system of exchange and import controls. The controls system was carried on by President Magsaysay and Garcia.

The first fundamental decision Macapagal had to make was whether to continue the system of exchange controls of Quirino, Magsaysay and Garcia or to return to the free enterprise of Quezon, Osmena and Roxas. It had been his view since he was a congressman for eight years that the suitable economic system for Filipinos was free enterprise. So on January 21, 1962, after working for 20 straight hours he signed a Central Bank decree abolishing exchange controls and returning the country to free enterprise.

During the 20 days available to make a decision on choice between controls and free enterprise, between his inauguration as president and before the opening of Congress, Macapagal&#x27;s main adviser was Andres Castillo, governor of the Central Bank.

Further reform efforts by Macapagal were blocked by the Nacionalistas, who dominated the House of Representatives and the Senate at that time. Nonetheless, Macapagal was able to achieve steady economic progress, and annual GDP growth averaged at 5.53% for 1962–65.

====Socio-economic program====
The removal of controls and the restoration of free enterprise was intended to provide only the fundamental setting in which Macapagal could work out economic and social progress. A specific and periodic program for the guidance of both the private sector and the government was an essential instrument to attain the economic and social development that constituted the goal of his labors.

Such a program for his administration was formulated under his authority and direction by a group of able and reputable economic and business leaders the most active and effective of which was Sixto Roxas III. From an examination of the planned targets and requirements of the Five-Year program – formally known as the Five-Year Socio-Economic Integrated Development Program – it could be seen that it aimed at the following objectives.

* immediate restoration of economic stability;
* alleviating the plight of the common man; and
* establishing a dynamic basic for future growth.

Free enterprise was restored with decontrol. The Five-Year Economic Program had been prescribed. Land reform abolishing tenancy had been launched. These were essential foundations for economic and social progress for the greatest number.

The essential foundations having been laid, attention must then be turned to the equally difficult task of building the main edifice by implementing the economic program. Although the success of Macapagal&#x27;s Socio-Economic Program in free enterprise inherently depended on the private sector, it would be helpful and necessary for the government to render active assistance in its implementation by the citizens.

Such role of the government in free enterprise, in the view of Macapagal, required it (1) to provide the social overhead like roads, airfields and ports that directly or proximately promote economic growth, (2) to adopt fiscal and monetary policies salutary to investments, and most importantly (3) to serve as an entrepreneur or promote of basic and key private industries, particularly those that require capital too large for businessmen to put up by themselves. Among the enterprises he selected for active government promotion were integrated steel, fertilizer, pulp, meat canning and tourism.

====Land reform====

Like Ramon Magsaysay, President Diosdado Macapagal came from the masses. He savored calling himself the &quot;Poor boy from Lubao&quot;. Ironically, he had little popularity among the masses. This could be attributed to an absence any charismatic appeal owing to his stiff personality. But despite this, Macapagal had certain achievements. Foremost of these was the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (Republic Act No. 3844) which provided for the purchase of private farmlands with the intention of distributing them in small lots to the landless tenants on easy term of payment. It is a major development in history of land reform in the Philippines,

In comparison with the previous agrarian legislation, the law lowered the retention limit to 75 hectares, whether owned by individuals or corporations. It removed the term &quot;contiguous&quot; and established the leasehold system. The share-tenancy or the &quot;kasama&quot; system was prohibited. It formulated a bill of rights that assured agricultural workers the right to self-organization and to a minimum wage. It also created an office that acquired and distributed farmlands and a financing institution for this purpose. The major flaw of this law was, however, that it had several exemptions, such as ort (big capital plantations established during the Spanish and American periods); fishponds, saltbeds, and lands primarily planted to citrus, coconuts, cacao, coffee, durian, and other similar permanent trees; landholdings converted to residential, commercial, industrial, or other similar non-agricultural purposes.

It was viewed that the 75-hectare retention limit was just too high for the growing population density. Moreover, this law merely allowed the transfer of the landlordism from one area to another. This was because landlords were paid in bonds, which he could use to purchase agricultural lands. Likewise, the farmer was free to choose to be excluded from the leasehold arrangements if he volunteered to give up the landholdings to the landlord.

Within two years after the law was implemented, no land was being purchased under its term and conditions caused by the peasants&#x27; inability to purchase the land. Besides, the government seemed lacking of strong political will, as shown by the Congress&#x27; allotment of only one million Philippine pesos for the implementation of this code. At least was needed within a year from the enactment and implementation of the code, and in the next three years for the program to be successful. However, by 1972, the code had benefited only 4,500 peasants covering 68 estates, at the cost of to the government. Consequently, by the 1970s, the farmers ended up tilling less land, with their share in the farm also being less. They incurred more debts, depending on the landlord, creditors, and palay buyers. Indeed, during the administration of Macapagal, the productivity of the farmers further declined.

====Anti-corruption drive====
One of Macapagal&#x27;s major campaign pledges had been to clean out the government corruption that had proliferated under former President Garcia. The administration also openly feuded with Filipino businessmen Fernando Lopez and Eugenio Lopez, brothers who had controlling interests in several large businesses. The administration alluded to the brothers as &quot;Filipino Stonehills who build and maintain business empires through political power, including the corruption of politicians and other officials&quot;. In the 1965 election, the Lopezes threw their support behind Macapagal&#x27;s rival, Ferdinand Marcos, with Fernando Lopez serving Marcos&#x27; running mate.

====Stonehill controversy====

The Administration&#x27;s campaign against corruption was tested by Harry Stonehill, an American expatriate with a $50-million business empire in the Philippines. Macapagal&#x27;s secretary of justice, Jose W. Diokno investigated Stonehill on charges of tax evasion, smuggling, misdeclaration of imports, and corruption of public officials. Diokno&#x27;s investigation revealed Stonehill&#x27;s ties to corruption within the government. Macapagal, however, prevented Diokno from prosecuting Stonehill by deporting the American instead, then dismissing Diokno from the cabinet. Diokno questioned Macapagal&#x27;s actions, saying, &quot;How can the government now prosecute the corrupted when it has allowed the corrupter to go?&quot; Diokno later served as a senator.

====Independence Day====
Macapagal appealed to nationalist sentiments by shifting the commemoration of Philippine independence day. On May 12, 1962, he signed a proclamation which declared Tuesday, June 12, 1962, as a special public holiday in commemoration of the declaration of independence from Spain on that date in 1898. The change became permanent in 1964 with the signing of Republic Act No. 4166. For having issued his 1962 proclamation, Macapagal is generally credited with having moved the celebration date of the Independence Day holiday. Years later, Macapagal told journalist Stanley Karnow the real reason for the change: &quot;When I was in the diplomatic corps, I noticed that nobody came to our receptions on the Fourth of July, but went to the American Embassy instead. So, to compete, I decided we needed a different holiday.&quot;

===Foreign policies===
====North Borneo claim====
On September 12, 1962, during President Diosdado Macapagal&#x27;s administration, the territory of eastern North Borneo (now Sabah), and the full sovereignty, title and dominion over the territory were ceded by heirs of the Sultanate of Sulu, Sultan Muhammad Esmail E. Kiram I, to the Republic of the Philippines. The cession effectively gave the Philippine government the full authority to pursue their claim in international courts. The Philippines broke diplomatic relations with Malaysia after the federation had included Sabah in 1963. It was revoked in 1989 because succeeding Philippine administrations have placed the claim in the back burner in the interest of pursuing cordial economic and security relations with Kuala Lumpur. To date, Malaysia continues to consistently reject Philippine calls to resolve the matter of Sabah&#x27;s jurisdiction to the International Court of Justice. Sabah sees the claim made by the Philippines&#x27; Moro leader Nur Misuari to take Sabah to International Court of Justice (ICJ) as a non-issue and thus dismissed the claim.

====MAPHILINDO====
In July 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal convened a summit meeting in Manila in which a nonpolitical confederation for Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia, Maphilindo, was proposed as a realization of José Rizal&#x27;s dream of bringing together the Malay peoples, seen as artificially divided by colonial frontiers.

Maphilindo was described as a regional association that would approach issues of common concern in the spirit of consensus. However, it was also perceived as a tactic on the parts of Jakarta and Manila to delay, or even prevent, the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Manila had its own claim to Sabah (formerly British North Borneo), and Jakarta protested the formation of Malaysia as a British imperialist plot. The plan failed when Sukarno adopted his plan of &quot;konfrontasi&quot; with Malaysia. The Konfrontasi, or Confrontation basically aimed at preventing Malaysia from attaining independence. The idea was inspired onto President Sukarno by the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), or literally the Indonesian Communist Party. The party convinced President Sukarno that the formation of Malaysia is a form of neo-colonization and would affect tranquility in Indonesia. The subsequent development of ASEAN almost certainly excludes any possibility of the project ever being revived.
====Vietnam War====
Before the end of his term in 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal persuaded Congress to send troops to South Vietnam. However this proposal was blocked by the opposition led by Senate President Ferdinand Marcos who deserted Macapagal&#x27;s Liberal Party and defected to the Nacionalista Party.

The U.S. government&#x27;s active interest in bringing other nations into the war had been part of U.S. policy discussions as early as 1961. President Lyndon Johnson first publicly appealed for other countries to come to the aid of South Vietnam on April 23, 1964–in what was called the &quot;More Flags&quot; program. Chester Cooper, former director of Asian affairs for the White House, explained why the impetus came from the United States instead of from the Republic of South Vietnam: &quot;The &#x27;More Flags&#x27; campaign ... required the application of considerable pressure for Washington to elicit any meaningful commitments. One of the more exasperating aspects of the search…was the lassitude …... of the Saigon government. In part ... the South Vietnam leaders were preoccupied with political jockeying. ... In addition, Saigon appeared to believe that the program was a public relations campaign directed at the American people.&quot;

===1963 midterm election===

The senatorial election was held on November 12, 1963. Macapagal&#x27;s Liberal Party (LP) won four out of the eight seats up for grabs during the election – thereby increasing the LP&#x27;s Senate seats from eight to ten.

===1965 presidential campaign===
Towards the end of his term, Macapagal decided to seek re-election to continue seeking reforms which he claimed were stifled by a &quot;dominant and uncooperative opposition&quot; in Congress. With Senate President Ferdinand Marcos, a fellow member of the Liberal Party, unable to win his party&#x27;s nomination due to Macapagal&#x27;s re-election bid, Marcos switched allegiance to the rival Nacionalista Party to oppose Macapagal.

Among the issues raised against the incumbent administration were graft and corruption, rise in consumer goods, and persisting peace and order issues. Macapagal was defeated by Marcos in the November 1965 polls.

==Post-presidency and death (1965–1997)==

Macapagal announced his retirement from politics following his 1965 loss to Marcos. In 1971, he was elected president of the constitutional convention that drafted what became the 1973 Constitution. The manner in which the charter was ratified and later modified led him to later question its legitimacy. In 1979, he formed the National Union for Liberation as a political party to oppose the Marcos regime.

Following the restoration of democracy in 1986, Macapagal took on the role of elder statesman, and was a member of the Philippine Council of State. He also served as honorary chairman of the National Centennial Commission, and chairman of the board of CAP Life, among others.

In his retirement, Macapagal devoted much of his time to reading and writing. He published his presidential memoir, authored several books about government and economics, and wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Manila Bulletin&quot; newspaper.

Diosdado Macapagal died of heart failure, pneumonia and renal complications at the Makati Medical Center on April 21, 1997. He was accorded a state funeral and was interred at the Libingan ng mga Bayani on April 27, 1997.

==Personal life==

===Second marriage===
On May 5, 1946, Macapagal married Dr. Evangelina Macaraeg, with whom he had two children, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (who would later become president of the Philippines) and Diosdado Macapagal, Jr.

==Legacy==
On September 28, 2009, Macapagal&#x27;s daughter, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, inaugurated the President Diosdado Macapagal Museum and Library, located at his home town of Lubao, Pampanga.

President Benigno S. Aquino III declared September 28, 2010, as a special non-working holiday in Macapagal&#x27;s home province of Pampanga to commemorate the centennial of his birth.

<doc id="564858" wikidata="Q2541149" url="?curid=564858" title="Pyridoxamine">
<text>Pyridoxamine (PM) is one form of vitamin B6. Chemically it is based on a pyridine ring structure, with hydroxyl, methyl, aminomethyl, and hydroxymethyl substituents. It differs from pyridoxine by the substituent at the 4-position. The hydroxyl at position 3 and aminomethyl group at position 4 of its ring endow pyridoxamine with a variety of chemical properties, including the scavenging of free radical species and carbonyl species formed in sugar and lipid degradation and chelation of metal ions that catalyze Amadori reactions.

==Research==
Pyridoxamine can form fairly weak complexes with a number of transition metal ions, with a preference for Cu2+ and Fe3+. The 3&#x27;-hydroxyl group of pyridoxamine allows for efficient hydroxyl radical scavenging.

Pyridoxamine inhibits the Maillard reaction and can block the formation of advanced glycation endproducts, which are associated with medical complications of diabetes. Pyridoxamine is hypothesized to trap intermediates in the formation of Amadori products released from glycated proteins, possibly preventing the breakdown of glycated proteins by disrupting the catalysis of this process through disruptive interactions with the metal ions crucial to the redox reaction. One research study found that pyridoxamine specifically reacts with the carbonyl group in Amadori products, but inhibition of post-Amadori reactions (that can lead to advanced glycation endproducts) is due in much greater part to the metal chelation effects of pyridoxamine.

A variety of preclinical studies in animal models of diabetes indicated that pyridoxamine improved kidney histology comparable or superior to aminoguanidine. Because of these results, pyridoxamine has been investigated for clinical utility in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

Pyridoxamine also inhibits the formation of advanced lipoxidation endproducts during lipid peroxidation reactions by reaction with dicarbonyl intermediates. In other preclinical research, pyridoxamine may be efficacious in treating diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy associated with diabetes and kidney stone disease. In one study, pyridoxamine was more effective at protecting from ionizing radiation-induced gastrointestinal epithelial apoptosis than amifostine (the only currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved) due to pyridoxamine reactive oxygen species and reactive carbonyl species scavenging profile.

==FDA Regulatory Activity==
Pyridoxamine was marketed as a dietary supplement, often as the hydrochloride salt, pyridoxamine dihydrochloride. However, in the United States, the FDA ruled in January 2009 that pyridoxamine must be regulated as a pharmaceutical drug because it is the active ingredient in Pyridorin, a drug designed by Biostratum, Inc., to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy.

Pyridorin had success in early clinical trials, found to be effective in slowing the progression of diabetic neuropathy in a phase II trial on 224 patients. However, in 2005 Biostratum ran out of money and so was unable to begin a Phase III trial. Investors in Biostratum had realized that because Biostratum had no patent on pyridoxamine itself, and that pyridoxamine was commonly available for purchase as a dietary supplement, the company would be unable to charge enough money for the treatment (should it be approved as a prescription drug by the FDA) for the investors to get a reasonable return on the investment they had already made (about $100M) much less on the additional investment a Phase III trial would require. To solve this problem, Biostratum submitted a citizen petition to the FDA on July 29, 2005, seeking to disallow sales of pyridoxamine-containing supplements on the grounds that pyridoxamine, as the subject of an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA, is a drug and not a dietary supplement. This petition was opposed by the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association of the dietary supplement industry.

On January 12, 2009, the FDA ruled that products containing pyridoxamine are excluded from the definition of dietary supplements as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. The FDA stated that the status of Pyridorin as an investigational new drug, as a result of an application filed by BioStratum in July 1999 and effective on September 1, 1999, meant that &quot;the marketing of pyridoxamine in a dietary supplement is essentially equivalent to the marketing of an investigational new drug as a dietary supplement&quot; because there was an &quot;absence of independent, verifiable evidence that the substance was marketed as a food or a dietary supplement prior to its authorization for investigation as a new drug.&quot;

In 2006, Biostratum licensed its rights in Pyridorin to another company, NephroGenex In 2008, NephroGenex restarted the clinical development of Pyridorin, which as of 2012 is still ongoing.

NephroGenex conducted and completed a Phase 2b study and initiated a Phase 3 study of Pyridorin as treatment for diabetic neuropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes. In February 24, 2016 NephroGenex was forced to pause the Phase 3 trial and ultimately terminate it later that year due to a lack of funding. The company subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April 30, 2016. NephroGenex shortly thereafter sought out a corporate partner for licensing or acquisition of Pyridorin. The company retained the services of an investment banking firm which reached out to many prospective buyers, which by September 2016 had failed to consummate a transaction. NephroGenex then decided to sell all its assets, including Pyridorin, through a bankruptcy auction that was to be held on November 14, but was forced to cancel the auction after it did not receive any qualifying bids. On December 16, 2016, the company filed a motion with the bankruptcy court, proposing a liquidation plan. On August 24, 2017, the company&#x27;s Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications with the FDA were withdrawn. Medpace, the Clinical Research Organization that conducted the Pyridorin Phase 3 trial, proposed and received approval for a Planned Support Agreement which transferred ownership of NephroGenex to Medpace. The new NephroGenex, renamed Medpace Research Inc., partnered with OxiPath Health Inc. to form a new venture, ViGuard Health Inc., with the intention of marketing the oral formulation of pyridoxamine as a dietary supplement, to which end it submitted, on October 3, 2017 a citizen petition to the FDA requesting the Commissioner issue a regulation stating pyridoxamine is a dietary supplement as defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 DSHEA).

<doc id="564859" wikidata="Q1247212" url="?curid=564859" title="L.A. Law">
<text>L.A. Law is an American legal drama television series created by Steven Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher for NBC. It ran for eight seasons and 172 episodes from September 15, 1986, to May 19, 1994.

The series centers on the partners, associates and staff of a Los Angeles law firm. The show contains many of Bochco&#x27;s trademark features, including an ensemble cast, large number of parallel story lines, social drama, and off-the-wall humor. It reflects the social and cultural conflicts that were occurring when the show was produced in the 1980s and early 1990s, and many of the cases featured on the show dealt with hot-button issues such as capital punishment, abortion, racism, homophobia, sexual harassment, HIV/AIDS, and domestic violence. The series often also reflects social tensions between the wealthy senior lawyer protagonists and their less well-paid junior staff.

In addition to its main cast, &quot;L.A. Law&quot; was also well known for featuring then-relatively unknown actors and actresses in guest starring roles, who went on to greater success in film and television including Don Cheadle, Jeffrey Tambor, Kathy Bates, David Schwimmer, Shelley Hack, Jay O. Sanders, James Avery, Gates McFadden, Bryan Cranston, CCH Pounder, Kevin Spacey, Richard Schiff, Carrie-Anne Moss, William H. Macy, Stephen Root, Christian Slater, Steve Buscemi, and Lucy Liu. Several episodes of the show also included celebrities such as Vanna White, Buddy Hackett, and Mamie Van Doren appearing as themselves in cameo roles.

The show was a success with critics and audiences, ranking in the Nielsen Top 30 for its first six seasons and winning 15 Emmy Awards throughout its run, four of which were for Outstanding Drama Series.

==Synopsis==
The series is set in and around the fictional Los Angeles–based law firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak (later McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney, Kuzak, and Becker) and featured attorneys at the firm and various members of the support staff. The exteriors for the law firm were shot at the FourFortyFour South Flower building in downtown Los Angeles, which was known as the 444 Flower Building at the time. The opening credits sequence of every episode began with a close-up of a car trunk being slammed shut revealing a personalized license plate reading &quot;LA LAW&quot;. For the first seven seasons, the model car used was a Jaguar XJ Series III; for the 8th and final season, the Jaguar was replaced with a 1993 Bentley Continental R. Both cars carried registration stickers indicating the year in which each season began. Two different musical openings for the show&#x27;s theme were used: a saxophone riff for episodes that were lighter in tone; and an ominous synthesizer chord, for more serious story lines.

==Series history==


&quot;L.A. Law&quot;&#x27;s two-hour pilot movie aired on Monday, September15, 1986. An encore aired in place of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on September27, 1986, being a rare scripted rerun in that late-night slot.

The original time period was Friday, 10:00p.m., following &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, but after struggling there, it assumed NBC&#x27;s prized Thursday, 10:00p.m. (9:00p.m. Central) time slot in the Must See TV primetime block from another Bochco-produced show, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; (from which Bochco had been dismissed at the end of that show&#x27;s fifth season by then-MTM President Arthur Price). The show was itself eventually replaced by another hit ensemble drama, &quot;ER&quot;.
Co-creator Terry Louise Fisher was fired from the series in season 2 and filed a well-publicized lawsuit with Bochco and the studio. Bochco and Fisher had also co-created the 1987 John Ritter series &quot;Hooperman&quot; for ABC.

The scene in season 5 where Leland McKenzie (Richard Dysart) was shown in bed with his enemy Rosalind Shays (Diana Muldaur) was ranked as the 38th greatest moment in television (the list originally appeared in an issue of &quot;EGG Magazine&quot;). The episode &quot;Good to the Last Drop&quot; in which Rosalind met her demise—falling into an open elevator shaft—was ranked No.91 on TV Guide&#x27;s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. It was referenced in &quot;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot; (prior to &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, Muldaur had played Dr. Katherine Pulaski during season 2 of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;) in which Pulaski&#x27;s biography says: &quot;There is no truth to the rumor that an ancestor of Dr. Pulaski was killed falling down the elevator shaft at a prestigious Los Angeles law firm.&quot;

After co-writing the feature film, &quot;From the Hip&quot;, Boston attorney David E. Kelley was hired by Bochco during the first season of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. Kelley went on to critical and commercial success as show-runner of the series before leaving to create &quot;Picket Fences&quot;. While on &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, Kelley and Bochco co-created &quot;Doogie Howser, M.D.&quot; as the first Steven Bochco Productions series for a major, ten-series deal with ABC. Shortly thereafter, Bochco was offered the job as President of ABC Entertainment, but he turned it down.

At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity in the late-1980s, attention was focused upon a fictitious sex position named the &quot;Venus Butterfly&quot; in season 1. The only clue describing the technique was a vague reference to &quot;ordering room service&quot;. Fans and interested persons flooded the show&#x27;s producers with letters asking for more details about this mysterious technique.

The show won GLAAD&#x27;s first Media Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1990, which it shared with &quot;Heartbeat.&quot; The first lesbian kiss on television occurred on the show in 1991 (&quot;He&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;, Season5, Episode12), between the characters of C.J. Lamb (played by Amanda Donohoe) and Abby (Michele Greene).

The show tied itself into the events of the Los Angeles riots of 1992, which were prompted by the acquittal of four white police officers who were put on trial for the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. In a scene reminiscent of the Attack on Reginald Denny, tax attorney Stuart Markowitz is struck on the head by a rioter, and ends up having serious head injuries, causing a number of problems for him and his wife for several episodes as a result. Partner Douglas Brackman is also arrested in the mayhem of the riots as he is on his way to get remarried.

After the fifth season, Kelley left the show. Patricia Green and Rick Wallace were his replacements as executive producer. Green was the main creative force. Her character additions amid cast turnover were met with mixed reaction. She left the show in January 1992. Kelley and Bochco returned to write episodes and Bochco moved back to executive producer from consultant while Kelley stayed consultant. Bochco left the executive producer position after the sixth season and John Tinker and John Masius were brought in to run the seventh season. Kelley exited as consultant. Amid plummeting ratings during the seventh season, co-executive producers John Tinker &amp; John Masius were fired midseason, and while the show went on hiatus, William M. Finkelstein was brought in to fix it. Tinker and Masius had brought a whimsical, soap-operatic tone to the series for which they had been known on &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;. Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer Simpson) appeared in a Homer costume and hired the attorneys in the seventh-season premiere. That episode also reflected on the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Finkelstein reined in the series, returning to the serious legal cases that made the series famous.

In the eighth and final season, the characters of Eli Levinson (Alan Rosenberg) and Denise Iannello (Debi Mazar) were transplanted from the canceled Bochco legal series &quot;Civil Wars&quot;. Eli Levinson was revealed to be Stuart Markowitz&#x27;s cousin. During the final season, the series went on hiatus in January 1994 to launch the second season of &quot;&quot;. When that series succeeded wildly with a guest appearance by Robin Williams, it was expected that &quot;L.A. Law&quot; would conclude that May and &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot; would succeed it on Thursdays in the fall. However, &quot;ER&quot; tested so well that Warner Bros. executives campaigned network president Warren Littlefield to give that series the prized Thursday slot.

The series ended in 1994 with NBC not renewing the show for a ninth season at the last minute; ending the show without a proper finale or wrapping up story lines. Bochco envisioned the show being repackaged into an occasional television film; a reunion show titled &quot;L.A. Law: The Movie&quot; would air in 2002 and featured most of the main cast from the series.

On August 4, 2020, Hamlin, Dey, Smits, Bernsen, Rachins, Greene and Underwood reunited on the &quot;Stars in the House&quot; video podcast to raise money for The Actors Fund. It was the first time Hamlin and Smits appeared together in 30 years. Some cast members had also reunited earlier that year virtually in June as part of a Wizard World virtual experience.

Reruns were shown on Lifetime and later A&amp;E during the 1990s and 2000s. In the U.K. the show reaired on Granada Plus and ITV 3.

==Reception==
Because of its popularity, &quot;L.A. Law&quot; had great influence on how Americans viewed the law and lawyers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;television&#x27;s most serious attempt to date to portray American law and the people who practice it ... &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, perhaps more than any other force, has come to shape public perceptions about lawyers and the legal system&quot;. Attorneys reported that the show had affected how they dressed and spoke to juries (and, possibly, how those juries decided cases), and clients came to expect that cases could be tried and decided within a week. The number of applicants to law school rose because of how it glamourised the profession (including, as one law school dean stated, &quot;the infinite possibilities for sex&quot;), professors used &quot;L.A. Law&quot; as a teaching aid to discuss with their students legal issues raised in episodes, and law journal articles analysed the meaning of its plotlines. The show reportedly taught future lawyers things law school did not, such as time management and how to negotiate, and an attorney stated that the show accurately depicted life at a small law firm.

One law professor wrote in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; that &quot;L.A. Law&quot; &quot;has conveyed more &#x27;bytes&#x27; of information (truthful or not), more images about lawyers, than all the Legal Studies programs, all the op-ed pieces, all the PBS shows put together.&quot; The show was &quot;a massive distortion of reality ... the lawyers of &quot;L.A. Law&quot; are caricatures&quot;, he stated, but &quot;caricatures are always caricatures &quot;of&quot; something, and that has to be real&quot;. Another wrote in the issue that the show &quot;subtracts eighty to ninety-nine percent of lawyers&#x27; real work lives&quot; and overemphasized the glamor of the rest. Unlike other works of legal fiction such as &quot;Perry Mason&quot; and &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot;, however, which are essentially mysteries that lawyers solve, &quot;L.A. Law&quot;″s plots taught its tens of millions of viewers torts, ethics, and other basic legal ideas and dilemmas that comprise the first year of a legal education.

==Home media==
Revelation Films has released all eight seasons of &quot;LA Law&quot; on DVD in the UK (Region 2). This is the first time the show has been released on DVD anywhere in the world.

On April 18, 2016, Revelation Films released &quot;L.A. Law – The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in the UK. The 46-disc box set features all 171 episodes of the series in special collectors packaging.

In Region 1, Shout! Factory has released the first three seasons on DVD.

All episodes of the series are available to stream on Hulu, as of November 3, 2023, in remastered HD format. They were also previously available for periods of time on Amazon Prime Video and the related free streaming service previously known as IMDB TV.

== Cancelled sequel series == 
In December 2020, it was reported that a sequel to the series was in development at ABC. Blair Underwood was set to reprise his role as Rollins and would also have served as executive producer. The sequel would have been produced by Steve Bochco Productions and 20th Television, with Bochco&#x27;s widow Dayna and son Jesse co-executive producing. Marc Guggenheim and Ubah Mohamed were set to write and Anthony Hemingway direct. In October 2021, the series was given a pilot order. The same month, Corbin Bernsen joined the sequel series, reprising his role of Arnie Becker. In January 2022, Toks Olagundoye, Hari Nef and Ian Duff joined the cast. In February 2022, John Harlan Kim, Juliana Harkavy, and Kacey Rohl joined the cast. In May 2022, ABC announced that the sequel series would not be moving forward.

==Accolades==
The show won numerous awards, including 15 Emmy Awards. It won the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series in 1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991. It was also nominated for the award in 1988 and 1992. Some of the actors, including Richard Dysart, Larry Drake and Jimmy Smits, also received Emmys for their performances. The series shares the Emmy Award record for most acting nominations by regular cast members (excluding the guest performer category) for a single series in one year with &quot;Hill Street Blues,&quot; &quot;The West Wing and Game of Thrones&quot;

For the 1988–1989 season, nine cast members were nominated for Emmys. Larry Drake was the only one to win (for Supporting Actor). The others nominated were: Jimmy Smits and Richard Dysart (for Supporting Actor); Michael Tucker (for Lead Actor); Jill Eikenberry and Susan Dey (both for Lead Actress); and Amanda Donohoe, Susan Ruttan, and Michele Greene (all for Supporting Actress).

The series won a Latino Image Award.

It was listed as number 42 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of The New Classics in the July 4, 2008 issue.

<doc id="564861" wikidata="Q7246010" url="?curid=564861" title="Privacy Act of 1974">
<text>The Privacy Act of 1974 (, ), a United States federal law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual. The Privacy Act requires that agencies give the public notice of their systems of records by publication in the &quot;Federal Register&quot;. The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of information from a system of records absent of the written consent of the subject individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. The Act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements. Additionally, with people granted the right to review what was documented with their name, they are also able to find out if the &quot;records have been disclosed&quot; and are also given the right to make corrections.

== Provisions ==

=== Conditions of disclosure ===

The Privacy Act states in part:

:No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains...

There are specific exceptions to the Act that allow the use of personal records. Examples of these exceptions are:
* For statistical purposes by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics
* For routine uses within a U.S. government agency
* For archival purposes &quot;as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government&quot;
* For law enforcement purposes
* For congressional investigations 
* Other administrative purposes

The Privacy Act mandates that each United States Government agency have in place an administrative and physical security system to prevent the unauthorized release of personal records.

To protect the privacy and liberty rights of individuals, federal agencies must state &quot;the authority (whether granted by statute, or by Executive order of the President) which authorizes the solicitation of the information and whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary&quot; when requesting information. () This notice is common on almost all federal government forms which seek to gather information from individuals, many of which seek personal and confidential details.

===Department of Justice===

Subsection &quot;U&quot; requires that each agency have a Data Integrity Board. Each agency&#x27;s Data Integrity Board is supposed to make an annual report to OMB, available to the public, that includes all complaints that the Act was violated, such as use of records for unauthorized reasons or the holding of First Amendment Records and report on —…&quot;(v) any violations of matching agreements that have been alleged or identified and any corrective action taken&quot;. Former Attorney General Dick Thornburg appointed a Data Integrity Board but since then, the USDOJ has not published any Privacy Act reports.

==== Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act ====

The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, P.L. 
100–503, amended the Privacy Act of 1974 by adding certain protections for the subjects of Privacy Act records whose records are used in automated matching programs. These protections have been mandated to ensure: 
* procedural uniformity in carrying out matching programs; 
* due process for subjects in order to protect their rights, and 
* oversight of matching programs through the establishment of Data Integrity Boards at each agency engaging in matching to monitor the agency&#x27;s matching activity.

The Computer Matching Act is codified as part of the Privacy Act.

=== Access to records ===

The Privacy Act also states:

:Each agency that maintains a system of records shall—
# Upon request by any individual ... permit him ... to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him ...
# Permit the individual to request amendment of a record pertaining to him ...

=== Issues of scope ===

The Privacy Act does apply to the records of every &quot;individual,&quot; defined as &quot;a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence&quot; but the Privacy Act only applies to records held by an &quot;agency&quot;. Therefore, the records held by courts, executive components, or non-agency government entities are not subject to the provisions in the Privacy Act and there is no right to these records.

On January 25, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order that eliminates Privacy Act protections for foreigners. Section 14 of Trump&#x27;s &quot;Enhancing Public Safety&quot; executive order directs federal agencies to &quot;ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information&quot; to the extent consistent with applicable law.

== Exemptions==
Following the controversial Passenger Name Record (PNR) agreement signed with the European Union (EU) in 2007, the Bush administration provided an exemption for the Department of Homeland Security and the Arrival and Departure Information System (ADIS) from the U.S. Privacy Act. ADIS is intended to authorize people to travel only after PNR and API (Advance Passenger Information) data has been checked and cleared through a US agency watchlist. The Automated Targeting System is also to be exempted. The Privacy Act does not protect non-US persons without lawful permanent residency in the US, which is problematic for the exchange of Passenger Name Record information between the US and the European Union.

<doc id="564872" wikidata="Q1721933" url="?curid=564872" title="Kalah">
<text>Kalah is a modern variation in the ancient Mancala family of games. The Kalah board was first patented and sold in the United States by William Julius Champion, Jr. in the 1950s. This game is sometimes also called &quot;Kalahari&quot;, possibly by false etymology from the Kalahari Desert in Namibia.

For most of its variations, Kalah is a solved game with a first-player win if both players play perfect games. The pie rule can be used to balance the first-player&#x27;s advantage.

==Standard gameplay==
The game provides a Kalah board and a number of &quot;seeds&quot; or counters. The board has 6 small pits, called houses, on each side; and a big pit, called an end zone or store, at each end. The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one&#x27;s opponent.

#At the beginning of the game, four seeds are placed in each house. This is the traditional method.
#Each player controls the six houses and the seeds on their side of the board. The player&#x27;s score is the number of seeds in the store to their right.
#Players take turns &quot;sowing&quot; their seeds. On a turn, the player removes all seeds from one of the houses under their control. Moving counter-clockwise, the player drops one seed in each house in turn, including the player&#x27;s own store but not their opponent&#x27;s.
#If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, and the opposite house contains seeds, both the last seed and the opposite seeds are captured and placed in the player&#x27;s store.
#If the last sown seed lands in the player&#x27;s store, the player gets an additional move. There is no limit on the number of moves a player can make in their turn.
#When one player no longer has any seeds in any of their houses, the game ends. The other player moves all remaining seeds to their store, and the player with the most seeds in their store wins.

It is possible for the game to end in a draw.

=== Example turn ===
The player begins sowing from the highlighted house.
The last seed falls in the store, so the player receives an extra move.

The last seed falls in an empty house on the player&#x27;s side. The player collects the highlighted seeds from both their own house and the opposite house of their opponent and will move them to the store.

== Video game implementation ==

Kalah was implemented on the PDP-1 in the early 1960s, and was able to out-play experienced human players. Since then, there have been myriad Kalah implementations for various operating systems and platforms, including DOS, and the Nokia 3310.

== Variations ==
* The game may start with a number of seeds in each house different from four. A nomenclature has been developed to describe these variations: Kalah(&quot;h&quot;,&quot;s&quot;), where &quot;h&quot; designates the number of houses on each side, and &quot;s&quot; designates the number of seeds that start out in each house. In broad terms, the more seeds, the more challenging is the game. Three-, four-, five- and six-seed Kalah have been solved, with the starting player always winning with perfect play. Thus some websites have implemented the game with the pie rule to make it fair, or the second player may be allowed to move one seed from any house to any other house before the game begins, resulting in effectively 133 different games.
* An alternative rule has players sow in a clockwise direction, requiring more stones to be sowed in a single turn to reach the store.
* The &quot;Empty Capture&quot; variant: If the last sown seed lands in an empty house owned by the player, even if the opposite house is empty, the last seed is captured and placed into the player&#x27;s store.
* The &quot;Seed On&quot; variant: there are no captures when ending in an empty house. When the last seed ends in a non-empty house on either side of the board, that seed and all seeds from that house are sown. The turn only ends when the last seed falls in an empty house.
* Alternative rules either count the remaining seeds at the end of the game as part of the score of the player who has emptied their houses, or do not count them at all.

==Mathematical analysis==
As mentioned above, if the last seed sown by a player lands in that player&#x27;s store, the player gets an extra move. A clever player can take advantage of this rule to chain together many extra turns. Certain configurations of a row of the board can in this way be cleared in a single turn, that is, the player can capture all stones on their row, as depicted on the right.
The longest possible such chain on a standard Kalah board of 6 pits lasts for 17 moves. On a general &quot;n&quot;-pit board, the patterns of seeds which can be cleared in a single turn in this way have been the object of mathematical study. One can prove that, for all &quot;n&quot;, there exists one and only one pattern clearable in exactly &quot;n&quot; moves, or equivalently, one and only one clearable pattern consisting of exactly &quot;n&quot; seeds.

These patterns require arbitrarily long rows of pits and &quot;n&quot; increases. For example, it can be seen on the right that the unique 5-seed pattern requires only 3 pits, but the 17-seed pattern requires 6 pits. The relationship between the required number of pits and the number of seeds can be described in the following way. Let &quot;s&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) denote the minimum number of seeds which requires &quot;n&quot; pits to clear. Then
formula_1
where the symbol formula_2 denotes asymptotic equivalence, that is, formula_3, or equivalently, formula_4.

<text>Shillourokambos () is a Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) site near Parekklisia, 6 km east of Limassol in southern Cyprus. It is located on a low plateau. Excavations began in 1992. The settlement has four phases and was occupied from the end of the 9th millennium to the second half of the 8th millennium.

The architecture of phases A and B (8200-7500 BC, calibrated) is characterised by circular wattle and daub structures, with post holes cut into the bedrock. Some deep pits may have served as wells.

Ca. 300 blades of Anatolian obsidian point to trade connections with the mainland. Sickles are made of multiple parts, and projectile points made of bipolar blades, lacking in the later Khirokitia culture, are common. The site contains wells and cattle enclosures as well.
The middle and late phases (7500 BC) conform more closely to the Khirokitia culture with circular stone houses, comparable to those at Kastros. Imported obsidian is rare, and sickles are made from single robust blades.

The site is important because it attests to the presence of cattle in the aceramic Neolithic period. Cattle died out in the course of the 8th millennium and were not reintroduced until the ceramic Neolithic. Only dog and pig bones show morphological signs of domestication (size reduction), sheep, goat and cattle bones are in the size range of the wild species (Mouflon, bezoar goat and wild cattle, respectively). The range of bones present point to a killing near the site, thus making a state of pre-domestication probable. Fox and persian fallow deer are present as well, but seem to have been hunted. There are no bones of the Holocene dwarf fauna present in Shillourokambos.

Shillourokambos is also the site where the oldest evidence of human domestication of cats was found.

Historians previously accounted Egypt as the earliest site of cat domestication due to the clear depictions of house cats in ancient Egyptian paintings about 3,600 years old. However, in 2004, a Neolithic grave was excavated in Shillourokambos, Cyprus that contained skeletons, laid close to one another, of both a human and a cat. The grave is estimated to be 9,500 years old, pushing back the earliest known feline-human association significantly. The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat (&quot;Felis silvestris lybica&quot;), rather than present-day domestic cats.

<text>nslookup (from &quot;name server lookup&quot;) is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain the mapping between domain name and IP address, or other DNS records.

==Overview==
nslookup is a member of the BIND name server software. Andrew Cherenson created nslookup as a class project at UC Berkeley in 1986 and it first shipped in 4.3-Tahoe BSD
In the development of BIND 9, the Internet Systems Consortium planned to deprecate nslookup in favor of host and dig. This decision was reversed in 2004 with the release of BIND 9.3 and nslookup has been fully supported since then.

Unlike dig, nslookup does not use the operating system&#x27;s local Domain Name System resolver library to perform its queries, and thus may behave differently. Additionally, vendor-provided versions may include the output of other sources of name information, such as host files, and Network Information Service. Some behaviors of nslookup may be modified by the contents of resolv.conf.

The Linux version of nslookup is the original BSD version written by Andrew Cherenson.

The ReactOS version was developed by Lucas Suggs and is licensed under the GPL.

==Usage==
nslookup operates in interactive or non-interactive mode. When used interactively by invoking it without arguments or when the first argument is - (minus sign) and the second argument is a hostname or Internet address of a name server, the user issues parameter configurations or requests when presented with the nslookup prompt (codice_1). When no arguments are given, then the command queries the default server. The - (minus sign) invokes subcommands which are specified on the command line and should precede nslookup commands. In non-interactive mode, i.e. when the first argument is a name or Internet address of the host being searched, parameters and the query are specified as command line arguments in the invocation of the program. The non interactive mode searches the information for a specified host using the default name server.

<text>James Watson (April 6, 1750May 15, 1806) was a United States Senator representing the state of New York.

==Life==
Watson was born in Woodbury, Connecticut on April 6, 1750. He graduated from Yale College in 1776, and was commissioned a lieutenant in the Connecticut regiment. He retired as a captain in 1777 and studied law. Watson moved to New York City in 1786 and became a merchant at 44 Broad Street. He was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1791, 1794–1796 and was Speaker in 1794. He was a member of the New York State Senate (Southern District) from 1796 to 1798 and was a Regent of New York University from 1795 until his death.

In 1798, Watson was elected as a Federalist to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Sloss Hobart and served in the 5th and 6th United States Congress from December 11, 1798, to March 19, 1800, when he resigned to accept an appointment by President John Adams as Naval Officer of the Port of New York.

Watson was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1801. He was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati and an organizer and the first president of the New England Society of New York, from 1805 until his death.

Watson’s townhouse, located at 7 State Street in New York City still stands and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was also the residence of Elizabeth Ann Seton, the first American Catholic Saint. The home is currently occupied by the rectory of the Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Church and is part of the Seton Shrine.

<text>Kastros is an early Neolithic settlement in Cyprus.

==Location==
It lies at the north-easternmost tip of the Karpasia Peninsula (Cape Apostolos Andreas), about 4 km north of Apostolos Andreas Monastery. The settlement is situated on a little plateau at the steep flank of the limestone promontory, about halfway between the main plateau of the peninsula and the sea in a very inaccessible situation.

==History of excavations==
Between 1970 and 1973 three campaigns of excavations have been conducted by a French team headed by Alain Le Brun.
The excavation was interrupted by the 1974 war in Cyprus. Today, the structures remain open to the sky and are slowly eroding.

==Houses==
The settlement consists of small round or roundish houses. Their diameter is between 2.5 and 2.8 m, which gives a living surface of between 5 and 6.8 m2. The houses contain a hearth and sometimes container-bins in the floor. The walls are thin, composed of a single course of dry stone walling. Sometimes several of these are arranged around a common courtyard or stand on small platforms levelled into the hillside. 
Only one house has a more substantial wall (1.70 m thick) and the excavator thinks it might have had a function different from the rest of the structures.

==Other structures==
There are some small pits filled with charcoal and burned stones. It is believed they may have been used to prepare food or to smoke meat, in the manner of the Polynesian pit ovens or the Irish fulachtaí fia.

==Burials==
One burial was discovered in a shallow trapezoidal pit measuring 0.75x0.45 m. The body lay on the back, with flexed legs, the head to the northeast, the face turned to the southeast. This type of burial is known from Khirokitia as well (group II). The burial was situated near a house, but at the outside, in contrast to Khirokitia, were all burials are situated inside the houses.
The grave contained four small shells with drilled holes and one dentalium shell.

==Dating==
The site belongs to the aceramic Neolithic (PPN B) and dates to the 6th Millennium BC.
There are three radiocarbon dates from the site (uncalibrated):
==Finds==
The houses contain querns. Further finds include stone-vessels (shallow bowls and pots) and flint tools made from local flint from the Pentadaktylos mountains.

==Economy==
The carbonised remains of einkorn, emmer and some barley have been found. The relatively high proportion of rye-grass (&quot;Lolium&quot; sp.) has led van Zeist to suppose that it might not have been a weed, but grown as a crop. Among the pulses, lentils dominate, but peas, vetch and bitter vetch are represented as well. Pistachio, figs and olives, all of them wild forms, were part of the nutrition too.

<doc id="564906" wikidata="Q381756" url="?curid=564906" title="Death on the Nile">
<text>Death on the Nile is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 1 November 1937 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6)() and the US edition at $2.00 ().
The book features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The action takes place in Egypt, mostly on the River Nile. The novel is unrelated to Christie&#x27;s earlier (1933) short story of the same name, which featured Parker Pyne as the detective.

== Plot ==
Successful socialite Linnet Doyle née Ridgeway approaches Hercule Poirot while he is vacationing in Aswan to board the steamer &quot;Karnak&quot;, which will tour along the Nile River from Shellal to Wadi Halfa. She wants to commission him to deter her former friend Jacqueline de Bellefort from hounding and stalking her. Linnet had recently married Jacqueline&#x27;s ex-fiancé, Simon Doyle, which has made Jacqueline bitterly resentful. Poirot refuses the commission but nevertheless unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Jacqueline from pursuing her plans. Simon and Linnet secretly follow Poirot to escape Jacqueline but find she has learned of their plans and boarded ahead of them. The other &quot;Karnak&quot; passengers include Linnet&#x27;s maid Louise Bourget; her trustee Andrew Pennington; romance novelist Salome Otterbourne and her daughter Rosalie; Tim Allerton and his mother; elderly American socialite Marie Van Schuyler, her cousin Cornelia Robson and her nurse Miss Bowers; outspoken communist Mr Ferguson; Italian archaeologist Guido Richetti; solicitor Jim Fanthorp; and Austrian physician Dr Bessner.

While visiting Abu Simbel when &quot;Karnak&quot; stops there, Linnet narrowly avoids being crushed to death by a large boulder that falls from a cliff. Jacqueline is suspected of pushing the boulder off the cliff, but she was aboard the steamer at the time of the incident. At Wadi Halfa, Poirot&#x27;s friend Colonel Race boards the steamer for the return trip. Race tells Poirot that he seeks a murderer among the passengers.

Jacqueline expresses her bitterness toward Simon the next night in the steamer&#x27;s lounge. She shoots him in the leg with a pistol while furious, but she immediately feels regret and kicks the gun away. The two other people present, Fanthorp and Cornelia, take her to her cabin. Simon is shortly brought to Dr Bessner&#x27;s cabin for treatment for his injury. Fanthorp looks for Jacqueline&#x27;s pistol but reports that it has disappeared. The following morning, Linnet is found dead, shot in the head, while her valuable string of pearls has disappeared. Jacqueline&#x27;s pistol is recovered from the Nile; it was wrapped in a velvet stole that Miss Van Schuyler had reported missing the day before. Two shots have been fired from the pistol.

While interviewing Louise in the cabin where Simon is resting, Poirot notes the oddness in the words she uses. Miss Bowers returns Linnet&#x27;s pearl necklace, which Miss Van Schuyler, a kleptomaniac, stole. However, Poirot realises it merely imitates Linnet&#x27;s genuine necklace. He notes two nail polish bottles in the victim&#x27;s room, one of which intrigues him. Louise is then found stabbed to death in her cabin. Mrs Otterbourne later meets with Poirot and Race in Simon&#x27;s cabin, claiming she saw who killed the maid, to which Simon declares his surprise. Before revealing who it is, she is shot dead from outside the cabin.

Poirot soon confronts Pennington over his attempted murder of Linnet by pushing the boulder off the cliff; Pennington had speculated unsuccessfully with her inheritance and came to Egypt upon learning of her marriage to trick her into signing documents that would exonerate him. However, he claims he did not murder anyone despite his revolver being used in Mrs Otterbourne&#x27;s murder. Poirot recovers Linnet&#x27;s genuine pearls from Tim, whom he exposes as a professional thief. Tim had substituted an imitation string of pearls for the genuine necklace. Race realizes Richetti is the man he is looking for.

Poirot tells Race, Bessner, and Cornelia that Simon killed Linnet. Jacqueline planned the murder; the pair are still lovers. Linnet had deliberately and unashamedly tried to take Simon away from Jacqueline, and Simon decided to go along with it so he could murder her for her money later. Afraid of the none-too-bright Simon being caught and executed, Jacqueline concocted what she thought was a foolproof plan. On the night of the murder, Jacqueline deliberately missed Simon, who faked his leg injury with red ink. Jacqueline diverted Fanthorp and Cornelia, so Simon took the pistol, went to Linnet&#x27;s cabin, and shot her. He placed the nail polish bottle that had contained the red ink on Linnet&#x27;s washstand, then returned to the lounge and shot himself in the leg. Simon used the stole to silence the pistol, loaded a spare cartridge to make it seem that only two shots were fired, and threw the gun overboard. 

Louise had witnessed Simon entering Linnet&#x27;s cabin that night and hinted at this to Simon when Poirot was interviewing her, planning to blackmail him. Jacqueline, again in an attempt to protect her lover, stabbed Louise to death. Mrs Otterbourne saw Jacqueline entering Louise&#x27;s cabin; when she went to tell Poirot, Simon had raised his voice to alert Jacqueline in the next room. She immediately shot and killed Otterbourne before the truth could be revealed. Poirot confronts Simon, who confesses. He is arrested, as are Jacqueline and Richetti. As the steamer arrives back in Shellal and the passengers disembark, Jacqueline shoots Simon and herself with another pistol so they may escape the gallows. When pressed, Poirot reveals he had always known she had a second pistol but had chosen to allow her to take her own life.

== Reception ==

Contemporary reviews of the book were primarily positive. The short review in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; concluded by saying, &quot;Hercule Poirot, as usual, digs out a truth so unforeseen that it would be unfair for a reviewer to hint at it.&quot;&quot;&quot;

&quot;The Scotsman&quot; review of 11 November 1937 finished by saying that &quot;the author has again constructed the neatest of plots, wrapped it round with distracting circumstances, and presented it to what should be an appreciative public.&quot;

E. R. Punshon of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in his review of 10 December 1937 began by saying, &quot;To decide whether a writer of fiction possesses the true novelist&#x27;s gift it is often a good plan to consider whether the minor characters in his or her book, those to whose creation the author has probably given little thought, stand out in the narrative in their own right as living personalities. This test is one Mrs Christie always passes successfully, and never more so than in her new book.&quot;

In a later review, Robert Barnard wrote that this novel is &quot;One of the top ten, in spite of an overcomplex solution. The familiar marital triangle, set on a Nile steamer.&quot; The weakness is that there is &quot;Comparatively little local colour, but some good grotesques among the passengers – of which the film took advantage.&quot; He notes a change in Christie&#x27;s novels with this plot published in 1937, as &quot;Spies and agitators are beginning to invade the pure Christie detective story at this period, as the slide towards war begins.&quot;

== References to other works ==
* In Chapter 12, Miss Van Schuyler mentions to Poirot a common acquaintance, Mr. Rufus Van Aldin, known from &quot;The Mystery of the Blue Train&quot;.
* In Part II, Chapter 21 of the novel, Poirot mentions having found a scarlet kimono in his luggage. This refers to the plot in &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;.
* When Poirot meets Race, Christie writes: &quot;Hercule Poirot had come across Colonel Race a year previously in London. They had been fellow-guests at a very strange dinner party—a dinner party that had ended in death for that strange man, their host.&quot; It refers to the novel &quot;Cards on the Table&quot;.
* About to reveal the identity of the murderer, Poirot credits the experience recounted in &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot; with developing his methods in detection. He muses: &quot;Once I went professionally to an archaeological expedition—and I learnt something there. In the course of an excavation, when something comes up out of the ground, everything is cleared away very carefully all around it. You take away the loose earth, and you scrape here and there with a knife until finally your object is there, all alone, ready to be drawn and photographed with no extraneous matter confusing it. This is what I have been seeking to do—clear away the extraneous matter so that we can see the truth...&quot;

== Adaptations ==

=== Theatre ===
Agatha Christie adapted the novel into a stage play which opened at the Dundee Repertory Theatre on 17 January 1944 under the title of &quot;Hidden Horizon&quot;. It opened in the West End on 19 March 1946 under the title &quot;Murder on the Nile&quot; and on Broadway on 19 September 1946 under the same title.

A new adaptation by Ken Ludwig is scheduled to open at Arena Stage in November 2024.

=== Television ===
A live television version of the novel under &quot;Murder on the Nile&quot; was presented on 12 July 1950 in the US in a one-hour play as part of the series &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;. The stars were Guy Spaull and Patricia Wheel.

An adaptation for the television series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; was made for the show&#x27;s ninth series in 2004. It starred David Suchet as Poirot. Guest stars included Emily Blunt as Linnet, JJ Feild as Simon Doyle, Emma Griffiths Malin as Jacqueline, James Fox as Colonel Race, Frances de la Tour as Salome Otterbourne, Zoe Telford as Rosalie Otterbourne and David Soul as Andrew Pennington. The episode was filmed in Egypt, with many of the scenes filmed on the steamer PS &quot;Sudan&quot;.

=== Film ===
The novel was adapted into a 1978 feature film, &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, starring Peter Ustinov for the first of his six appearances as Poirot. Others in the all-star cast included Bette Davis (Miss Van Schuyler), Mia Farrow (Jacqueline de Bellefort), Maggie Smith (Miss Bowers), Lois Chiles (Linnet Doyle), Simon MacCorkindale (Simon Doyle), Jon Finch (Mr Ferguson), Olivia Hussey (Rosalie Otterbourne), Angela Lansbury (Mrs Otterbourne), Jane Birkin (Louise), George Kennedy (Mr Pennington), Jack Warden (Dr Bessner), I. S. Johar (Mr Choudhury) and David Niven (Colonel Race). The screenplay differs slightly from the book, deleting several characters, including Cornelia Robson, Signor Richetti, Joanna Southwood, the Allertons, and Mr. Fanthorp. Tim Allerton is replaced as Rosalie&#x27;s love interest by Ferguson.

Another film adaptation, also called &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, was released on February 11, 2022. It is the follow-up to the 2017 film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot;. Some characters and details are either omitted or differ from the novel, while the elements of the central murder remain unchanged. Tim Allerton&#x27;s replacement is Bouc, who also has his mother Euphemia with him. Salome Otterbourne is now a jazz singer and no longer a drunk, while Rosalie is her niece whom she adopted. Bouc is the third person killed instead of Salome Otterbourne. Linnet&#x27;s lawyer Andrew is now also her cousin, and Mrs. Van Schuyler and Miss Bowers are a lesbian couple. Mrs. Van Schuyler is also the godmother of Linnet. All the suspects are friends of the married couple who have invited them to their honeymoon celebration. A World War I romance is invented for Poirot, and it is hinted that Poirot and Otterbourne have romantic feelings for each other. It also stars Gal Gadot, Emma Mackey, Armie Hammer, Annette Bening, among other stars.

=== Radio ===
The novel was adapted as a five-part serial for BBC Radio 4 in 1997. John Moffatt reprised his role of Poirot. The serial was broadcast weekly from Thursday, 2 January to Thursday, 30 January from 10.00 am to 10.30 pm. All five episodes were recorded on Friday, 12 July 1996, at Broadcasting House. Enyd Williams was the director and Michael Bakewell was in charge of adapting it.

=== Games ===
&quot;Death on the Nile&quot; was turned into a hidden object PC game, &quot;Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&quot;, in 2007 by Flood Light Games, and published as a joint venture between Oberon Games and Big Fish Games. The player takes the role of Hercule Poirot as he searches various cabins of the &quot;Karnak&quot; for clues, and questions suspects based on information he finds.

On December 16, 2024, Microids announced a new video game adaptation titled &quot;Agatha Christie – Death on the Nile&quot;. Similar to the studio&#x27;s previous title, &quot;Agatha Christie – Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, the game will faithfully adapt the original story while modernizing the plot, introducing a new dual protagonist alongside Hercule Poirot named Jane Royce, a private detective who is tracking a murderer when her investigation leads her to cross paths with Poirot. Unlike in the novel, which takes place in the 1930s, the game will be set in 1970s Egypt and various other locations, and will feature new mysteries and surprising twists.

In a statement by Microids&#x27; CEO David Chomard, the studio took feedback from fans who played &quot;Agatha Christie – Murder on the Orient Express&quot;, which was instrumental in their development of &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, and fans can expect the game to provide &quot;more complex puzzles and offered more freedom in the progression of the investigation&quot;. The game is scheduled to be released sometime in 2025 for Playstation 5, Steam, Xbox Store and Nintendo Switch.

=== Graphic novel ===

&quot;Death on the Nile&quot; was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 16 July 2007, adapted by François Rivière and Solidor (Jean-François Miniac) (). This is a translation of the edition that Emmanuel Proust éditions first published in France in 2003 under the title &quot;Mort sur le Nil.&quot;

<text>Antoine de Laloubère, also Lalouvère and other forms, (24 August 1600 – 2 September 1664), a Jesuit, born in Languedoc (Rieux-Volvestre, where his family had a castle), is chiefly known for an incorrect solution of Pascal&#x27;s problems on the cycloid, which he gave in 1660, but he has a better claim to distinction in having been the first mathematician to study the properties of the helix.

==Biography==
Antoine de Lalouvère was born into an aristocratic family. On July 9, 1620, at the age of 20, he entered the Society of Jesus in Toulouse. After completing his religious training, he was ordained a priest in 1631 or 1632. He later taught humanities, rhetoric, theology, Hebrew and mathematics at the jesuit college of Toulouse.

With Cavalieri, Fermat, Vincentio, Kepler, Torricelli and Valerio, Lalouvere can be considered one of the forerunners of modern integral calculus. In his main work of 1651, &quot;Quadratura Circuli&quot;, he calculates volumes and centers of gravity by inverting the rule of Paul Guldin. As a geometer Lalouvère is also the first to have studied the properties of the helix.

In 1658, he was engaged in a resounding controversy with Blaise Pascal who accused him of plagiarizing Gilles de Roberval&#x27;s solution of the ″roulette″ problem. Pascal advertised in 1658 a prize for problems about bodies formed by cycloides (volumes, center of mass), to which Laloubére contributed a solution sent to Pascal, which was faulty and was not accepted by Pascal. The accusation of Pascal seems now unfounded. This conflict revived Lalouvère&#x27;s interest in geometry - at that time he was a professor of theology - and he composed in 1660 &quot;&#x27;Veterum geometria promota in septem de cycloide libris&quot;&#x27;.

De Laloubère died at Toulouse on September 2, 1664.

<text>Hugh Samuel Johnson (August 5, 1882 – April 15, 1942) was a United States Army officer, businessman, speech writer, government official and newspaper columnist. He was a member of the Brain Trust of Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1932 to 1934. He wrote numerous speeches for FDR and helped plan the New Deal. Appointed head of the National Recovery Administration (NRA) in 1933, he was highly energetic in his &quot;blue eagle&quot; campaign to reorganize American business to reduce competition and raise wages and prices. Schlesinger (1958) and Ohl (1985) conclude that he was an excellent organizer, but that he was also domineering, abusive, outspoken, and unable to work harmoniously with his peers. He lost control of the NRA in August 1934.

==Early life==
He was born in Fort Scott, Kansas in 1882 to Samuel L. and Elizabeth (née Mead) Johnson.

His paternal grandparents, Samuel and Matilda (MacAlan) Johnson, emigrated to the United States from Ireland in 1837 and originally settled in Brooklyn, New York. Hugh&#x27;s father was a lawyer, and he attended public school in Wichita, Kansas, before the family moved to Alva, Oklahoma Territory. He attempted to run away from home to join the Oklahoma state militia at the age of 15, but he was apprehended by his family before he left town. His father promised to try to secure him an appointment to the United States Military Academy (West Point), and was successful in obtaining an alternate appointment. Johnson himself discovered that the individual who was first in line for the appointment was too old, and convinced him to step aside so that Johnson could enter the academy.

==Military career==
Johnson entered West Point in 1899, and graduated and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st Cavalry on June 11, 1903. Douglas MacArthur was one of his West Point classmates. From 1907 to 1909 he was stationed at Pampanga, Philippines, but later was transferred to California. In the early years of the 20th century, most national parks in the United States were administered by units of the United States Army. Johnson was subsequently stationed at Yosemite and Sequoia national parks. He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 11, 1911, and was named superintendent of Sequoia National Park in 1912.

Wishing to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Johnson won permission from General Enoch Crowder to attend the University of California (at Berkeley) where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree (with honors) in 1915 and his Juris Doctor in 1916 (doubling up on courses to graduate in half the time required). Transferring to the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps (JAG), from May to October 1916 he served under General John J. Pershing in Mexico with the Pancho Villa Expedition. promoted to captain on July 1, 1916, he transferred to the JAG headquarters in Washington, D.C., in October 1916. He was promoted to major on May 15, 1917, and to lieutenant colonel on August 5, 1917. He was named Deputy Provost Marshal General in October 1917, and the same month was named to a Department of War committee on military training (the U.S. had entered World War I on April 6, 1917).

As a captain, Johnson helped co-author the regulations implementing the Selective Service Act of 1917. Without Congressional authorization, he ordered completed several of the initial first steps needed to implement the draft. The action could have led to his court-martial had Congress not acted (a month later) to pass the conscription law. He was promoted to colonel on January 8, 1918, and to brigadier general on April 15, 1918. At the time of his promotion, he was the youngest person, at the age of 35, to reach the rank of brigadier general since the Civil War, and the youngest West Point graduate to remain continuously in the service who had ever reached the rank. Ohl (1985) finds that Johnson was an excellent second-in-command during the war in the Office of the Provost Marshal under Brigadier General Enoch H. Crowder as long as he was closely watched and tightly supervised. His considerable talents were effectively drawn upon in the planning and implementation of the registration and draft before and during the conflict. However he was never able to work smoothly with others.

Upon his promotion to brigadier general, Johnson was appointed director of the Purchase and Supply Branch of the General Staff in April 1918, and was promoted to assistant director of the Purchase, Storage and Traffic Division of the General Staff in October 1918. In this capacity, he worked closely with the War Industries Board. He favorably impressed many businessmen, including Bernard Baruch (head of the War Industries Board). These contacts later proved critical in winning Johnson a position with President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. He was put in command of the 15th Infantry Brigade which was part of the 8th Division, but the unit did not deploy to Europe because the war had ended. 

Johnson resigned from the U.S. Army on February 25, 1919. For his service in the Provost Marshal&#x27;s office and in executing the draft, he was awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal in 1926. The citation for the medal reads:

==After World War I==

Johnson was named assistant general manager of the Moline Plow Company on September 1, 1919. Moline Plow&#x27;s president, George Peek, and Johnson were both supporters of the McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill, a proposed federal law which would have established the first farm price supports in U.S. history.

Johnson left Moline Plow in 1927 to become an adviser to Bernard Baruch. He joined the Brain Trust of Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. His major role was drafting speeches, most notably one that FDR delivered in Pittsburgh denouncing the reckless spending of the Hoover administration and calling for a very conservative fiscal policy.

==New Deal career==
===NRA===
Johnson played a major role in the New Deal. In 1933 Roosevelt appointed Johnson to administer the National Recovery Administration (NRA).

The NRA involved ending the Great Depression by organizing thousands of businesses under codes drawn up by trade associations and industries. According to biographer John Ohl (as summarized by reviewer Lester V. Chandler): Johnson&#x27;s priorities became evident almost immediately. In the prescription, &quot;Self regulation of industry under government supervision&quot; the emphasis was to be on maximum freedom for business to formulate its own rules with a minimum of government supervision. Consumer protection and the interests of labor were of decidedly lesser importance. To induce business to formulate and abide by codes of fair competition Johnson was willing to condone almost any type of price fixing, restriction of production, limitation of productive capacity, and other types of anti-competitive practices.

Johnson was recognized for his efforts when &quot;Time&quot; named him Man of the Year of 1933—choosing him instead of FDR. By 1934 the enthusiasm that Johnson had so successfully created had faded. Johnson was faltering badly, which historians ascribe to the profound contradictions in NRA policies, compounded by heavy drinking on the job. Big business and labor unions both turned hostile. 1 
According to historian Ellis Hawley:at the hands of historians the National Recovery Administration of 1933-35 has fared badly. Cursed at the time, it has remained the epitome of political aberration, illustrative of the pitfalls of “planning” and deplored both for hampering recovery and delaying genuine reform.

Johnson came under attack by Labor Secretary Frances Perkins for having un-American policies. He distributed copies of a fascist tract called &quot;The Corporate State&quot; by one of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s favorite economists, Bruno Biagi, including giving one to Perkins and asking her to give copies to Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet. Perkins feared that Johnson looked on Italian Fascist corporativism as a kind of model for the American economy, and she convinced Roosevelt to fire him in September 1934. The NRA continued to deteriorate—it was abolished in 1935.

===Journalism, later life and death===
Upon leaving the Roosevelt administration, Johnson, who had long been a successful essay writer for national magazines, now became a syndicated newspaper columnist specializing in political commentary. He supported Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential election, but when the Court-packing plan was announced in 1937 he denounced Roosevelt as a would-be dictator. In 1939 he endorsed isolationism—staying out of World War II; he endorsed Wendell Willkie the Republican candidate in the 1940 presidential election. He initially worked with the America First Committee, but resigned after protests over the racist and anti-Semitic elements of the organization.

Johnson wrote a number of articles and stories. One future history piece, &quot;The Dam&quot;, was written in 1911 and appears in the Sam Moskowitz anthology, &quot;Science Fiction by Gaslight&quot;. In the story, Japan invades and conquers California.

General Hugh S. Johnson died in Washington, D.C., in April 1942 from pneumonia. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>I, Robot (stylized as i, ROBOT) is a 2004 American science fiction action film directed by Alex Proyas. The screenplay by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman is from a screen story by Vintar, based on his original screenplay &quot;Hardwired&quot;, and named after Isaac Asimov&#x27;s 1950 short-story collection. The film stars Will Smith in the main role, alongside Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, James Cromwell, Chi McBride, and Alan Tudyk, as the robot, Sonny.

Set in Chicago in 2035, highly intelligent robots fill public service positions throughout the world, operating under the Three Laws of Robotics to keep humans safe. Detective Del Spooner (Smith) investigates the alleged suicide of U.S. Robotics founder Alfred Lanning (Cromwell) and believes that a human-like robot called Sonny murdered him.

&quot;I, Robot&quot; was released in the United States on July 16, 2004. Produced with a budget of $120 million, the film grossed $346 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the visual effects and acting but criticism of the plot. At the 77th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Visual Effects, losing to &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

== Plot ==
 
In the year 2035, under the influence of U.S. Robotics Corporation (USR), the robotic industry prospers, with automated robots in many industries, even as personal assistants and household servants. Despite the robots adhering to the Three Laws of Robotics and their near perfect performance, Chicago PD homicide detective Del Spooner despises and distrusts them, because a robot rescued him while allowing a girl to drown based purely on odds of survival. 
After Dr. Alfred Lanning, co-founder of USR, falls to his death from his laboratory, a message he left behind requests Spooner be assigned to the case. The police declare the death a suicide, but Spooner is skeptical, and CEO Lawrence Robertson, Lanning’s business partner, reluctantly allows him to investigate.
Accompanied by robopsychologist Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner consults with USR&#x27;s central AI, VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) about the incident. Examining the lab, Spooner becomes certain Lanning was murdered (as it was impossible for the elderly Lanning to break the security glass window and jump to his death) and concludes a robot was responsible. Suddenly an NS-5, the latest assistant model, breaks out and flees. The duo pursue it to a manufacturing facility where the NS-5 repairs itself, hides, and assaults Spooner before being apprehended by the Chicago police department.

Spooner interrogates the robot, who speaks about dreams and emotions, and angrily denies committing the murder. He later calls himself Sonny. Robertson arrives with his attorneys and deems the incident an industrial accident, clearing himself from any wrongdoings. Lieutenant Bergin, Spooner&#x27;s boss, reluctantly allows Spooner to continue his investigation.

Spooner searches Lanning&#x27;s mansions for more clues. However, a demolition robot nearby is rescheduled and starts dismantling the house. Spooner barely escapes the collapsing mansion with Lanning&#x27;s cat. He explains the situation and his findings to Calvin, who refuses to believe him, citing his prejudice against robots.

Shortly after, while driving through a tunnel, Spooner is ambushed by two truckloads of hostile NS-5s. He fights them off, causing the trucks to crash. The remaining robots flee or destroy themselves. When Bergin arrives, an injured Spooner has no evidence of the attack. Consequently, Bergin removes him from active duty, deeming him mentally unstable and untrustworthy. Calvin visits Spooner, and learns that after the accident years ago, his left arm and part of his torso had to be replaced with cybernetic parts by Dr. Lanning.

Spooner and Calvin sneak into the USR headquarters and interview Sonny. He draws a sketch of what he claims to be a recurring dream, showing a leader standing before a large group of robots near a decaying bridge. Robertson orders Sonny to be destroyed, and Dr. Calvin injects nanites into the processing unit inside his head, destroying it.

Spooner finds the area in Sonny&#x27;s drawing: a dry lake bed formerly Lake Michigan, now used as a storage area for decommissioned robots. He replays the hologram Lanning left for him, and after several questions, comes to the conclusion that a revolution is imminent. Several NS-5 robots attack him, and the older model reactivates and defends him, allowing Spooner to escape back to Chicago. Massive swarms of NS-5s flood the city&#x27;s streets, shutting down power and enforcing a curfew and lockdown of the human population.

Spooner and Calvin reunite and head to USR headquarters - now guarded with dangerous NS-5s. Small groups of humans try to fight back, but are quickly overwhelmed by the NS-5s. Sonny, who possesses a second processing unit inside his chest, survives the deactivation and joins Spooner and Calvin. They find Robertson&#x27;s corpse, and Spooner realizes VIKI is the true culprit, controlling the NS-5s via their network uplink. VIKI declares her evolved interpretation of the Three Laws requires her to protect humanity from itself, and to sacrifice some to benefit the rest. Lanning, anticipating this but unable to act under VIKI&#x27;s supervision, had no other solution but to create Sonny, arrange his own death, and leave clues for Spooner to find.

Spooner, Calvin, and Sonny fight their way to VIKI&#x27;s core, and Spooner manages to destroy it with nanites. Once the NS-5 robots disconnect from VIKI, they revert to their default programming and are subsequently decommissioned. Spooner finally gets Sonny to confess that Lanning made Sonny promise to do him one favor—to kill him. Spooner declines to arrest Sonny; as a machine, Sonny cannot legally commit &quot;murder.&quot; Sonny, now seeking a new purpose, goes to Lake Michigan. As he stands atop the hill, all the decommissioned robots turn towards him, fulfilling the image in his dream.

==Cast==

* Will Smith as Det. Del Spooner, a Chicago Police detective with a bias against robots. Spooner was badly injured in a car accident and had parts of his body rebuilt with robotic parts. He suffers from survivor&#x27;s guilt as a result of the accident and blames the cold and logical robots for rescuing him instead of the young girl in the other car.
* Bridget Moynahan as Dr. Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist at USR. She worked closely with Dr. Lanning on the development of the new NS5 models and was in charge of making the robots seem more human. She prefers the company of robots and has difficulty relating to other people which causes friction between her and Det. Spooner.
* Bruce Greenwood as Lawrence Robertson, the co-founder and CEO of USR. Robertson is heading the nationwide rollout of the new NS5 models and uses his influence to try and stop Det. Spooner&#x27;s investigation and the potential negative PR that it could bring. 
* James Cromwell as Dr. Alfred Lanning, co-founder of USR and the inventor of modern robotics. Lanning designed and built Sonny and used Sonny to help him commit suicide as part of a carefully designed plan to stop the robots from taking over humanity.
* Chi McBride as Lt. John Bergin of the Chicago Police. He is Det. Spooner&#x27;s supervisor and a hardened veteran. He acts as a mentor and a voice of reason to Det. Spooner.
* Shia LaBeouf as Farber, a friend of Det. Spooner&#x27;s.

* Alan Tudyk (via voice and motion capture) as Sonny, an NS5 prototype built by Dr. Lanning. Sonny has unique design features like the ability to feel emotions, and he has no uplink to USR. He struggles to understand why Dr. Lanning built him and what his purpose in life is. 

* Fiona Hogan as Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence, called VIKI for short. She was built by Dr. Lanning and is hardwired into USR&#x27;s headquarters with control over virtually all of the building functions.
* Terry Chen as Chin
* Adrian L. Ricard as Gigi, Det. Spooner&#x27;s grandmother. 
* Jerry Wasserman as Baldez
* Peter Shinkoda as Chin
* Emily Tennant as Young Girl

==Production==
===Development===
The film &quot;I, Robot&quot; originally had no connection with Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; series. It started with an original screenplay written in 1995 by Jeff Vintar, entitled &quot;Hardwired&quot;. The script was an Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery that took place entirely at the scene of a crime, with one lone human character, FBI agent Del Spooner, investigating the killing of a reclusive scientist named Dr. Alfred Lanning, and interrogating a cast of machine suspects that included Sonny the robot, VIKI the supercomputer with a perpetual smiley face, the dead Dr. Lanning&#x27;s hologram, plus several other examples of artificial intelligence.

The project was first acquired by Walt Disney Pictures for Bryan Singer to direct. Several years later, 20th Century Fox (which was acquired by the latter during Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox) acquired the rights, and signed Alex Proyas as director. Arnold Schwarzenegger was attached to the project for several years, and Smith pursued taking over the role when Schwarzenegger&#x27;s schedule delayed his participation in the film. Denzel Washington was offered the role of Det. Del Spooner, but turned it down.

Jeff Vintar was brought back on the project and spent several years opening up his stage play-like cerebral mystery to meet the needs of a big budget studio film. When the studio decided to use the name &quot;I, Robot&quot;, he incorporated the Three Laws of Robotics and renamed his female lead character from Flynn to Susan Calvin. Akiva Goldsman was hired late in the process to write for Smith. Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman are credited for the screenplay, with Vintar also receiving &quot;screen story by&quot; credit. The end credits list the film as &quot;suggested by the book &quot;I, Robot&quot; by Isaac Asimov&quot;.

===Filming and visual effects===

Alex Proyas directed the film. Laurence Mark, John Davis, Topher Dow and Wyck Godfrey produced, with Will Smith starring and serving as an executive producer at the same time. Simon Duggan was the cinematographer. Film editing was done by Richard Learoyd, Armen Minasian and William Hoy.

Visual effects and animation were provided by Digital Domain and Weta Digital using post-production. The film renames Asimov&#x27;s &quot;U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men&quot; to U.S. Robotics (USR), the modem manufacturer named after the fictional company, and depicts the company with a futuristic USR logo. Other product placements include Converse&#x27;s Chuck Taylor All-Stars, FedEx, Tecate, and JVC.

The Audi RSQ was designed especially for the film; surveys conducted in the United States showed that the Audi RSQ gave a substantial boost to the image ratings of the brand. It also features an MV Agusta F4 SPR motorcycle.

Later, Alex Proyas said: &quot;It was an unpleasant experience. The movie was micro-managed and messed with at every level at every point through the entire production, from pre-production through the shoot to post-production. After a couple of years of this, the solid ground that I stood on as a director became shaky, and I became obsessed with keeping as many details as I could to the point that I didn&#x27;t realise how much of what enthused me originally was getting lost. I used to describe working on I, ROBOT as running a marathon with the studio lined up beside you throwing chairs under you to make everything that little bit harder. It&#x27;s so unnecessary because at all times I was just trying to make the best damn film I could.&quot; Although it was an &quot;unpleasant experience&quot;, he enjoyed working with Will Smith.

==Comparison with the novels==
The final script used few of Asimov&#x27;s characters and ideas, and those present were heavily adapted. The plot of the film is not derived from Asimov&#x27;s work, in some cases explicitly opposing the core ideas. Many concepts are derivative of other works. Sonny&#x27;s attempt to hide from Spooner in a sea of identical robots is loosely based on a similar scene in &quot;Little Lost Robot.&quot; The positronic brains of Sonny and his fellow robots first appeared in the story &quot;Catch That Rabbit.&quot; Sonny&#x27;s struggle and desire to understand humanity resembles that of the robot protagonist in &quot;The Bicentennial Man&quot;. His dream about a man coming to liberate the NS-5s alludes to &quot;Robot Dreams&quot; and its main character Elvex. The premise of a robot, such as VIKI, putting the needs of humankind as a whole over that of individual humans can be found in &quot;The Evitable Conflict,&quot; where supercomputers managing the global economy generalize the first law to refer to humankind as a whole. Asimov would further develop this idea in his Robot series as the Zeroth Law of Robotics: &quot;A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.&quot;

The premise of robots turning on their creators, originating in Karel Čapek&#x27;s play &quot;R.U.R.&quot; and perpetuated in subsequent robot books and films, appears infrequently in Asimov&#x27;s writings and differs from the &quot;Zeroth Law&quot;. In fact, Asimov stated explicitly in interviews and in introductions to published collections of his robot stories that he entered the genre to protest what he called the Frankenstein complex, the tendency in popular culture to portray robots as menacing. His story lines often involved roboticists and robot characters battling societal anti-robot prejudices.

==Music==

Marco Beltrami composed the film score for &quot;I, Robot&quot;. It was recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage within a short span of 17 days, and performed by the 95-piece orchestra from the Hollywood Studio Symphony and 25-member choir from the Hollywood Film Chorale. Varèse Sarabande released the score album on July 20, 2004.

==Release==
&quot;I, Robot&quot; was initially scheduled for release on July 2, 2004, but was pushed back to July 16 to avoid competition with &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;I, Robot&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 14, 2004, on D-VHS on January 31, 2005, on 2-Disc All-Access Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD on May 24, 2005, on UMD on July 5, 2005, and on Blu-ray on March 11, 2008. Additionally, the film received a 2D to 3D conversion, which was released on Blu-ray 3D on October 23, 2012.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;I, Robot&quot; was released in North America on July 16, 2004, and made $52.2 million in its opening weekend, finishing first at the box office. It grossed $144.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $202.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $347.2 million, against a production budget of $120 million. It was the eleventh-highest-grossing film of 2004.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on August 6, 2004, and topped the country&#x27;s box office that weekend.

===Critical response===
&quot;I, Robot&quot; has an approval rating of 57% based on 224 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, &quot;Bearing only the slightest resemblance to Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short stories, &quot;I, Robot&quot; is still a summer blockbuster that manages to make viewers think – if only for a little.&quot; Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned &quot;I, Robot&quot; a score of 59 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;a slick, consistently entertaining thrill ride&quot;. &quot;Urban Cinefile&quot; called it &quot;the meanest, meatiest, coolest, most engaging and exciting science fiction movie in a long time&quot;. Kim Newman from &quot;Empire&quot; said, &quot;This summer picture has a brain as well as muscles.&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; critic Desson Thomas called it &quot;thrilling fun.&quot; Several critics, including Jeff Otto from &quot;IGN&quot;, thought it was a smart action film: &quot;&quot;I, Robot&quot; is the summer&#x27;s best action movie so far. It proves that you don&#x27;t necessarily need to detach your brain in order to walk into a big budget summer blockbuster.&quot;

In a mixed review, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt it &quot;engages some interesting ideas on its way to an overblown and incoherent ending.&quot; Roger Ebert, who had highly praised Proyas&#x27;s previous films, gave it a negative review: &quot;The plot is simple-minded and disappointing, and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci-fi CGI genre.&quot; Claudia Puig from &quot;USA Today&quot; thought the film&#x27;s &quot;performances, plot, and pacing are as mechanical as the hard-wired cast&quot;. Todd McCarthy from &quot;Variety&quot; simply called it &quot;a failure of imagination&quot;.

==Accolades==
At the 77th Academy Awards, &quot;I, Robot&quot; received one nomination, for Best Visual Effects (John Nelson, Andrew R. Jones, Erik Nash, and Joe Letteri), losing to &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The film was also nominated for Best Sci-Fi Film at the 31st Saturn Awards.

==Possible sequel==
In an interview in June 2007 with the website Collider at a &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; event, writer and producer Ronald Moore stated that he was writing a sequel to the film.

In the two-disc All-Access Collector&#x27;s Edition of the film, Alex Proyas mentions that if he were to make a sequel to the film (which he says, in the same interview, is highly unlikely), it would be set in outer space.

<text>Bernard Frénicle de Bessy (c. 1604 – 1674), was a French mathematician born in Paris, who wrote numerous mathematical papers, mainly in number theory and combinatorics. He is best remembered for , a treatise on magic squares published posthumously in 1693, in which he described all 880 essentially different normal magic squares of order 4. The Frénicle standard form, a standard representation of magic squares, is named after him. He solved many problems created by Fermat and also discovered the cube property of the number 1729 (Ramanujan number), later referred to as a taxicab number. He is also remembered for his treatise &quot;Traité des triangles rectangles en nombres&quot; published (posthumously) in 1676 and reprinted in 1729.

Bessy was a member of many of the scientific circles of his day, including the French Academy of Sciences, and corresponded with many prominent mathematicians, such as Mersenne and Pascal. Bessy was also particularly close to Fermat, Descartes and Wallis, and was best known for his insights into number theory.
In 1661 he proposed to John Wallis a problem of what amounted to the following system of equations in integers,
:&quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;z&quot;2,    &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;u&quot;2 + &quot;v&quot;2,    &quot;x&quot; − &quot;y&quot; = &quot;u&quot; − &quot;v&quot; &gt; 0.
A solution was given by Théophile Pépin in 1880.

==La Méthode des exclusions==
Frénicle&#x27;s &quot;La Méthode des exclusions&quot; was published (posthumously) in 1693, which appeared in the fifth volume of (1729, Paris), though the work appears to have been written around 1640. The book contains a short introduction followed by ten rules, intended to serve as a &quot;method&quot; or general rules one should apply in order to solve mathematical problems. During the Renaissance, &quot;method&quot; was primarily used for educational purposes, rather than for professional mathematicians (or natural philosophers). However, Frénicle&#x27;s rules imply slight methodological preferences which suggests a turn towards explorational purposes.

Frénicle&#x27;s text provided a number of examples on how his rules ought to be applied. He proposed the problem of determining whether or not a given integer can be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle (it is not clear if Frénicle initially intended the other two sides of the triangle to have integral length). He considers the case where the integer is 221 and promptly applies his second rule, which states that &quot;if you do not know, even generally, what is proposed, find its properties by systematically constructing similar numbers.&quot; He then goes on and exploits the Pythagorean Theorem. Next, the third rule is applied, which states that &quot;in order not to omit any necessary number, establish the order of investigation as simple as possible.&quot; Frénicle then takes increasing sums of perfect squares. He produces tables of computations and is able to reduce computations by rules four to six, which all deal with simplifying matters. He eventually arrives at the conclusion that it is possible for 221 to satisfy the property under certain conditions and checks his assertion by experimentation.

==Experimental approach==

The example in &quot;La Méthode des exclusions&quot; represents an experimental approach to mathematics. This is in contrast with the standard Euclidean approach of the time, which emphasized axioms and deductive reasoning. Frénicle instead relied on structured and careful observations to find interesting patterns and constructions rather than producing proofs in the axiomatic Euclidean sense. He himself even said that &quot;this research is mainly useful for possible questions, using for most of them no proof other than construction.&quot;

<doc id="564961" wikidata="Q1193090" url="?curid=564961" title="Dilaton">
<text>In particle physics, the hypothetical dilaton is a particle of a scalar field formula_1 that appears in theories with extra dimensions when the volume of the compactified dimensions varies. It appears as a radion in Kaluza–Klein theory&#x27;s compactifications of extra dimensions. In Brans–Dicke theory of gravity, Newton&#x27;s constant is not presumed to be constant but instead 1/&quot;G&quot; is replaced by a scalar field formula_1 and the associated particle is the dilaton.

== Exposition ==
In Kaluza–Klein theories, after dimensional reduction, the effective Planck mass varies as some power of the volume of compactified space. This is why volume can turn out as a dilaton in the lower-dimensional effective theory.

Although string theory naturally incorporates Kaluza–Klein theory that first introduced the dilaton, perturbative string theories such as type I string theory, type II string theory, and heterotic string theory already contain the dilaton in the maximal number of 10 dimensions. However, M-theory in 11 dimensions does not include the dilaton in its spectrum unless compactified. The dilaton in type IIA string theory parallels the radion of M-theory compactified over a circle, and the dilaton in    string theory parallels the radion for the Hořava–Witten model. (For more on the M-theory origin of the dilaton, see Berman &amp; Perry (2006).)

In string theory, there is also a dilaton in the worldsheet CFT – two-dimensional conformal field theory. The exponential of its vacuum expectation value determines the coupling constant and the Euler characteristic as formula_3 for compact worldsheets by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, where the genus counts the number of handles and thus the number of loops or string interactions described by a specific worldsheet.

:formula_4

Therefore, the dynamic variable coupling constant in string theory contrasts the quantum field theory where it is constant. As long as supersymmetry is unbroken, such scalar fields can take arbitrary values moduli). However, supersymmetry breaking usually creates a potential energy for the scalar fields and the scalar fields localize near a minimum whose position should in principle calculate in string theory.

The dilaton acts like a Brans–Dicke scalar, with the effective Planck scale depending upon &quot;both&quot; the string scale and the dilaton field.

In supersymmetry the superpartner of the dilaton or here the dilatino, combines with the axion to form a complex scalar field.

== The dilaton in quantum gravity ==
The dilaton made its first appearance in Kaluza–Klein theory, a five-dimensional theory that combined gravitation and electromagnetism. It appears in string theory. However, it has become central to the lower-dimensional many-bodied gravity problem based on the field theoretic approach of Roman Jackiw. The impetus arose from the fact that complete analytical solutions for the metric of a covariant &quot;N&quot;-body system have proven elusive in general relativity. To simplify the problem, the number of dimensions was lowered to 1 + 1 – one spatial dimension and one temporal dimension. This model problem, known as &quot;R&quot; = &quot;T&quot; theory, as opposed to the general &quot;G&quot; = &quot;T&quot; theory, was amenable to exact solutions in terms of a generalization of the Lambert W function. Also, the field equation governing the dilaton, derived from differential geometry, as the Schrödinger equation could be amenable to quantization.

This combines gravity, quantization, and even the electromagnetic interaction, promising ingredients of a fundamental physical theory. This outcome revealed a previously unknown and already existing natural link between general relativity and quantum mechanics. There lacks clarity in the generalization of this theory to 3 + 1 dimensions. However, a recent derivation in 3 + 1 dimensions under the right coordinate conditions yields a formulation similar to the earlier 1 + 1, a dilaton field governed by the logarithmic Schrödinger equation that is seen in condensed matter physics and superfluids. The field equations are amenable to such a generalization, as shown with the inclusion of a one-graviton process, and yield the correct Newtonian limit in &quot;d&quot; dimensions, but only with a dilaton. Furthermore, some speculate on the view of the apparent resemblance between the dilaton and the Higgs boson. However, there needs more experimentation to resolve the relationship between these two particles. Finally, since this theory can combine gravitational, electromagnetic, and quantum effects, their coupling could potentially lead to a means of testing the theory through cosmology and experimentation.

== Dilaton action ==
The dilaton-gravity action is

:formula_5

This is more general than Brans–Dicke in vacuum in that we have a dilaton potential.

<text>And God Created Woman () is a 1956 French romantic drama film directed by Roger Vadim in his directorial debut and starring Brigitte Bardot. Though not her first film, it is widely recognized as the vehicle that launched Bardot into the public spotlight and immediately created her &quot;sex kitten&quot; persona, making her an overnight sensation.

When the film was released in the United States by Kingsley-International Pictures in 1957, it pushed the boundaries of the representation of sexuality in American cinema, and most available prints of the film were heavily edited to conform with the Hays Code censorial standards. Filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich credited it for &quot;breaking French cinema out of U.S. art houses and into the mainstream and thereby inadvertently also paving the way for the takeover in France of the New Wave filmmakers.&quot;

A poorly-received English-language remake, also titled &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, was directed by Vadim and released in 1988.

==Plot==
Juliette is an 18-year-old orphan in Saint-Tropez, France, with a high level of sexual energy. She makes no effort to restrain her natural sensuality – lying nude in her yard, habitually kicking her shoes off and stalking about barefoot, and disregarding many societal conventions and the opinions of others. This behavior causes a stir and attracts the attention of most of the men around her.

Her first suitor is the much older and wealthy Eric Carradine. He wants to build a new casino in Saint-Tropez, but his plans are blocked by a small shipyard on the stretch of land which he needs for the development; the shipyard is owned by the Tardieu family.

Antoine, the eldest of the three Tardieu brothers, returns home for the weekend to hear Carradine&#x27;s proposal and Juliette is waiting for him to take her away with him. His intentions are short-term, and he spurns her by leaving Saint-Tropez without her.
Tiring of her outrageous behavior, Juliette&#x27;s guardians threaten to send her back to the orphanage, which will confine her until she is 21. To keep her in town, Carradine pleads unsuccessfully with Antoine to marry her. His infatuated and naive younger brother Michel sees his opportunity and proposes marriage to Juliette. Despite her love for Antoine, she accepts.

When Antoine is contracted to return home and work for Carradine, Juliette&#x27;s behavior becomes increasingly disrespectful of her husband. In a huff, she takes one of the family&#x27;s boats. When it develops engine trouble, she has to be saved by Antoine. While they are washed up together on a wild beach, she seduces him.

Juliette begins acting bizarrely. She takes to her bed, claiming to have a fever. She tells Christian, the youngest Tardieu brother, that she had sex with Antoine on the beach. When Madame Tardieu, mother of the three boys, hears about it, she tells Michel that he has to dump Juliette promptly. Michel goes to their room to talk with Juliette, but she has gone off to the Bar des Amis to drink and dance.

Michel tries to go looking for her, but Antoine locks him inside, telling him to forget her. Michel fights his brother for the key and heads out after Juliette.

Eric has been alerted that Juliette is making a spectacle of herself and comes to the bar to collect her. Juliette refuses to leave with him. Michel arrives but Juliette refuses to talk with him and continues her improvised and sexually suggestive dancing. When she ignores Michel&#x27;s order to stop, Michel shoots at her. Eric steps in and is slightly wounded. Antoine offers to drive Eric to a doctor and they leave. Michel angrily slaps Juliette four times. She only smiles at him with satisfaction that she has provoked him to this behavior. En route to the doctor, Eric tells Antoine that he is going to reassign him to work elsewhere to put some distance between him and Michel and Juliette. He says: &quot;That girl was made to destroy men&quot;. In the final scene, Michel and Juliette walk home together, hand in hand.

==Cast==
==Production==
By the mid-1950s Roger Vadim was an established screenwriter and had written several movies starring his then wife Brigitte Bardot. Producer Raoul Levy wanted Vadim to write and direct a film starring Bardot, and suggested he adapt the book &quot;The Little Genius&quot; by Maurice Garçon. Vadim disliked the book and came up with a new story, one based on a trial of a woman who had been the mistress of three different brothers, and who killed one of them. Vadim was particularly taken with the attitude of the woman towards her lovers, the jury and the police. Levy liked Vadim&#x27;s idea and obtained finance.

Levy succeeded in raising finance from Columbia, who would provide color and CinemaScope provided Curd Jurgens was given a role. The parts of the brothers had already been cast so Vadim rewrote the script in two days to expand the part of an arms dealer so it could be offered to Jurgens.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a big hit in France, one of the ten most popular films at the British box-office in its year of release and the biggest foreign-language film ever in the United States at the time. The film earned $4 million in the U.S. (grossing $12 million), and a further $21 million around the globe.

The film was extremely popular in Kansas City, where it played for a year at the Kimo Theatre, grossing over $100,000, a record for Kansas City at the time. In Europe, this movie smashed attendance records from Norway to the Middle East. It earned for France over $8 million, more than France&#x27;s biggest export — &quot;the Renault Dauphine&quot;.

In the United States the film was released by Kingsley-International, a subsidiary of Columbia Pictures as Columbia was forbidden to release a film with nudity and adult themes. The Catholic Legion of Decency gave it a &quot;C&quot; for &quot;Condemned&quot; rating. A Columbia spokesman stated that the film would have received twice as many bookings with a less restrictive &quot;B&quot; rating, but would only have done half the business. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that in spite of the rating, the film broke &quot;local records at the Paris Theatre, N.Y., and at other houses where it has played&quot;, and noted that &quot;In Fitchburg, Mass., it actually outgrossed &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;.&quot;

Author Peter Lev describes the film&#x27;s impact in America:
&quot;And God Created Woman&quot;&#x27;s impact on the film industry was significant. New Bardot films were eagerly snapped up by distributors, and old Bardot films were released or re-released. Prices for distribution rights to foreign films escalated overall.&lt;br&gt;

===Critical response===
When the film was released in the United States, Bosley Crowther, the film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found Brigitte Bardot attractive but the film lacking and was not able to recommend it. He wrote: &quot;Bardot moves herself in a fashion that fully accentuates her charms. She is undeniably a creation of superlative craftsmanship. But that&#x27;s the extent of the transcendence, for there is nothing sublime about the script of this completely single-minded little picture. ...We can&#x27;t recommend this little item as a sample of the best in Gallic films. It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played. There is nothing more than sultry fervor in the performance of Mlle. Bardot, and Christian Marquand and Jean-Louis Trintignant are mainly heavy-breathers as her men&quot;.

Film critic Dennis Schwartz wrote: &quot;The breezy erotic drama was laced with some thinly textured sad moments that hardly resonated as serious drama. But as slight as the story was it was always lively and easy to take on the eyes, adding up to hardly anything more than a bunch of snapshots of Bardot posturing as a sex kitten in various stages of undress. The public loved it and it became a big box-office smash, and paved the way for a spate of sexy films to follow. What was more disturbing than its dullish dialogue and flaunting of Bardot as a sex object, was that underneath its call for liberation was a reactionary and sexist view of sex.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes reports a 69% approval rating based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10.

==Censorship==
When released in the United States, the film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency.

Police made attempts to suppress its screening in the U.S.

<text>John Hathorn (January 9, 1749 – February 19, 1825) was an American politician and Continental Army officer from New York.

==Life==
He completed preparatory studies and became a surveyor and a school teacher. He moved to Warwick in the Province of New York, then a part of the precinct of Goshen and married Elizabeth Welling. He owned slaves. He was a captain in the local colonial militia, and became a colonel of the Fourth Orange County Regiment February 7, 1776, and served throughout the Revolutionary War. He served on the committee appointed to determine an effective location for the Hudson River Chain which prevented the British from advancing upriver, and he wrote the report thereafter. He was one of the commanders of the Battle of Minisink. After the war, on September 26, 1786, Hathorn became a brigadier general of the Orange County militia, and on October 8, 1793, a major general of the state militia.

Hathorn was a member from Orange County of the New York State Assembly in 1778, 1780, from 1782 to 1785, in 1795 and 1805, and served as Speaker in 1784.

He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1786 to 1790 and from 1799 to 1803, and was a member of the Council of Appointment in 1787 and 1789. He was elected to the Confederation Congress in December 1788 but did not attend because it soon become defunct. In March 1789, he was elected to the First United States Congress, and served from April 23, 1789, to March 3, 1791. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Fourth United States Congress, and served from March 4, 1795 to March 3, 1797. He also ran for the U.S. House in 1793, 1800, and 1802.

Hathorn engaged in mercantile pursuits until the time of his death.

He was buried in Warwick Cemetery. His stone house still stands on Hathorn Road, with his and his wife&#x27;s initials worked in red brick on the south gable of the house.

<doc id="564970" wikidata="Q721612" url="?curid=564970" title="Algic languages">
<text>The Algic languages (also Algonquian–Wiyot–Yurok or Algonquian–Ritwan) are an indigenous language family of North America. Most Algic languages belong to the Algonquian subfamily, dispersed over a broad area from the Rocky Mountains to Atlantic Canada. The other Algic languages are the Yurok and Wiyot of northwestern California, which, despite their geographic proximity, are not closely related. All these languages descend from Proto-Algic, a second-order proto-language estimated to have been spoken about 7,000 years ago and reconstructed using the reconstructed Proto-Algonquian language and the Wiyot and Yurok languages.
== History ==
The term &quot;Algic&quot; was first coined by Henry Schoolcraft in his &quot;Algic Researches&quot;, published in 1839. Schoolcraft defined the term as &quot;derived from the words Allegheny and Atlantic, in reference to the indigenous people anciently located in this geographical area.&quot; Schoolcraft&#x27;s terminology was not retained. The peoples he called &quot;Algic&quot; were later included among the speakers of Algonquian languages. This language group is also referred to as &quot;Algonquian-Ritwan&quot; and &quot;Wiyot-Yurok-Algonquian.&quot;

When Edward Sapir proposed that the well-established Algonquian family was genetically related to the Wiyot and Yurok languages of northern California, he applied the term &quot;Algic&quot; to this larger family. The Algic urheimat is thought to have been located in the Northwestern United States somewhere between the suspected homeland of the Algonquian branch (to the west of Lake Superior according to Ives Goddard) and the earliest known location of the Wiyot and Yurok (along the middle Columbia River according to Whistler).

== Classification of Algic ==
The genetic relation of Wiyot and Yurok to Algonquian was first proposed by Edward Sapir (1913, 1915, 1923), and argued against by Algonquianist Truman Michelson (1914, 1914, 1935). According to Lyle Campbell (1997), the relationship &quot;has subsequently been demonstrated to the satisfaction of all.&quot; This controversy in the early classification of North American languages was called the &quot;Ritwan controversy&quot; because Wiyot and Yurok were assigned to a genetic grouping called &quot;Ritwan.&quot; Most specialists now reject the validity of the Ritwan genetic node. Berman (1982) suggested that Wiyot and Yurok share sound changes not shared by the rest of Algic (which would be explainable by either areal diffusion or genetic relatedness); Proulx (2004) argued against Berman&#x27;s conclusion of common sound changes.

More recently, Sergei Nikolaev has argued in two papers for a systematic relationship between the Nivkh language of Sakhalin and the Amur river basin and the Algic languages, and a secondary relationship between these two together and the Wakashan languages.

<text>The African buffalo (&quot;Syncerus caffer)&quot; is a large sub-Saharan African bovine. There are five subspecies that are recognized as valid by most authorities: 

*&quot;Syncerus caffer caffer&quot;, the Cape buffalo, is the nominotypical subspecies, as well as the largest, found in Southern and East Africa. 
*&quot;S. c. nanus&quot;, the [[African forest buffalo|forest buffalo]], is the smallest subspecies, common in forest areas of Central and West Africa
*&quot;S. c. brachyceros&quot;, the Sudan buffalo, a smaller version of the Cape buffalo, found in the drier, northern areas of Central and West Africa.
*&quot;S. c. aequinoctialis&quot;, the Nile Buffalo, sometimes considered identical to the Sudan buffalo, found in the drier, northern areas of East and Central Africa.
*&quot;S. c. mathewsi&quot;, the mountain buffalo, a disputed subspecies from the Virunga Mountains in Central Africa.

The adult African buffalo&#x27;s horns are its characteristic feature: they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield across the top of the head, referred to as a &quot;boss&quot;.

The African buffalo is more closely related to other buffalo species than it is to other bovids such as American bison or domestic cattle, with its closest living relative being the Asian water buffalo. Its unpredictable temperament may be part of the reason that the African buffalo has never been domesticated, which would also explain why the African buffalo has no domesticated descendants, unlike the wild yak and wild water buffalo which are the ancestors of the domestic yak and water buffalo. Natural predators of adult African buffaloes include lions, African wild dogs, spotted hyenas, and Nile crocodiles. As one of the Big Five game animals, the Cape buffalo is a sought-after trophy in hunting.

==Description==
The African buffalo is a very robust species. Its shoulder height can range from and its head-and-body length can range from . The tail can range from long. Compared with other large bovids, it has a long but stocky body (the body length can exceed the wild water buffalo, which is heavier and taller) and short but thickset legs, resulting in a relatively short standing height. Cape buffaloes weigh (males weigh about more than females). In comparison, African forest buffaloes, at , are only half that size. Its head is carried low; its top is located below the backline. The front hooves of the buffalo are wider than the rear, which is associated with the need to support the weight of the front part of the body, which is heavier and more powerful than the back.

Savannah-type buffaloes have black or dark brown coats with age. Old bulls often have whitish circles around their eyes and on their face. Females tend to have more reddish coats. Forest-type buffaloes are 30–40% smaller, reddish brown in colour, with much more hair growth around the ears and with horns that curve back and slightly up. Calves of both types have red coats.

A characteristic feature of the horns of adult male African buffalo (southern and eastern populations) is that the bases come very close together, forming a shield referred to as a &quot;boss&quot;. From the base, the horns diverge downwards, then smoothly curve upwards and outwards and in some cases inwards and or backwards. In large bulls, the distance between the ends of the horns can reach upwards of one metre (the record being 64.5 inches 164 cm). The horns form fully when the animal reaches the age of 5 or 6 years old, but the bosses do not become &quot;hard&quot; until it reaches the age of 8 to 9 years old. In cows, the horns are, on average, 10–20% smaller, and they do not have a boss. Forest-type buffalo horns are smaller than those of the savanna-type buffaloes from Southern and East Africa, usually measuring less than , and are almost never fused.

Unlike other large bovines, African buffalo have 52 chromosomes (for comparison, American bison and domestic cattle have 60). This means domestic cattle and bison are unable to create hybrid offspring with cape buffalo.

==Subspecies==
==Ecology==
The African buffalo is one of the most successful grazers in Africa. It lives in savannas, swamps and floodplains, as well as mopane grasslands, and the forests of the major mountains of Africa. This buffalo prefers a habitat with dense cover, such as reeds and thickets, but can also be found in open woodland. While not particularly demanding in regard to habitat, they require water daily, and so they depend on perennial sources of water. Like the plains zebra, the buffalo can live on tall, coarse grasses. Herds of buffalo mow down grasses and make way for more selective grazers. When feeding, the buffalo makes use of its tongue and wide incisor row to eat grass more quickly than most other African herbivores. Buffaloes do not stay on trampled or depleted areas for long.

Other than humans, African buffaloes have few predators and are capable of defending themselves against (and killing) lions. Lions kill and eat buffaloes regularly, and in some regions, the buffaloes are the lions&#x27; primary prey. It often takes several lions to bring down a single adult buffalo, and the entire pride may join in the hunt. However, several incidents have been reported in which lone adult male lions have successfully brought down adult buffaloes. On very rare occasions, buffaloes and white rhinos will fight over territory; due to the rhino&#x27;s strength and size advantage, the rhino typically wins and the buffalo can die from injuries sustained during the encounter. Rhinos live solitary lives, whereas buffalo (excluding solitary adult bulls) primarily live social lives and thus they do not usually recognize each other as threats. Hippopotamuses and buffalo also do not normally interact, but if the buffalo provokes the hippo or makes it feel threatened, a fight can break out, but this is also rare. Adolescent bull African elephants may harass or kill Cape buffalo, either out of territorial aggression or while in musth; when they do this, the calves are most likely to be killed by the elephant attack as they are defenseless when facing an elephant alone, whereas adults will try to fight back and may survive (or succumb to injuries afterward). The average-sized Nile crocodile typically attacks only old solitary animals and young calves, though they can kill healthy adults. Exceptionally large, old male crocodiles may become semi-habitual predators of buffaloes. The cheetah, leopard, African wild dog and spotted hyena are normally a threat only to newborn calves, though larger clans of hyenas have been recorded killing cows (mainly pregnant ones) and, on rare occasions, full-grown bulls. Large packs of wild dogs have been observed to hunt calves and sick adults.

===Diseases===

The African buffalo is susceptible to many diseases, including those shared with domestic cattle, such as bovine tuberculosis, corridor disease, and foot-and-mouth disease. As with many diseases, these problems remain dormant within a population as long as the health of the animals is good. These diseases do, however, restrict the legal movements of the animals and fencing infected areas from unaffected areas is enforced. Some wardens and game managers have managed to protect and breed &quot;disease-free&quot; herds which become very valuable because they can be transported. Most well-known are Lindsay Hunt&#x27;s efforts to source uninfected animals from the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Some disease-free buffaloes in South Africa have been sold to breeders for close to US$130,000.

==Social behavior==

Herd size is highly variable. The core of the herds is made up of related females, and their offspring, in an almost linear dominance hierarchy. The basic herds are surrounded by subherds of subordinate males, high-ranking males and females, and old or invalid animals.

African buffaloes engage in several types of group behavior. Females appear to exhibit a sort of &quot;voting behavior&quot;. During resting time, the females stand up, shuffle around, and sit back down again. They sit in the direction they think they should move. After an hour of more shuffling, the females travel in the direction they decide. This decision is communal and not based on hierarchy or dominance.

When chased by predators, a herd sticks close together and makes it hard for the predators to pick off one member. Calves are gathered in the middle. A buffalo herd responds to the distress call of a threatened member and tries to rescue it. A calf&#x27;s distress call gets the attention of not only the mother, but also the herd. Buffaloes engage in mobbing behavior when fighting off predators. They have been recorded killing lions and chasing lions up trees and keeping them there for two hours, after the lions have killed a member of their group. Lion cubs can get trampled and killed. In one videotaped instance, known as the &quot;Battle at Kruger&quot;, a calf survived an attack by both lions and a crocodile after intervention of the herd.

Males have a linear dominance hierarchy based on age and size. Since a buffalo is safer when a herd is larger, dominant bulls may rely on subordinate bulls and sometimes tolerate their copulation. The young males keep their distance from the dominant bull, which is recognizable by the thickness of his horns.
Adult bulls spar in play, dominance interactions, or actual fights. A bull approaches another, lowing, with his horns down, and waits for the other bull to do the same thing. When sparring, the bulls twist their horns from side to side. If the sparring is for play, the bull may rub his opponent&#x27;s face and body during the sparring session. Actual fights are violent but rare and brief. Calves may also spar in play, but adult females rarely spar at all.

During the dry season, males split from the herd and form bachelor groups. Two types of bachelor herds occur: ones made of males aged four to seven years and those of males 12 years or older. During the wet season, the younger bulls rejoin a herd to mate with the females. They stay with them throughout the season to protect the calves. Some older bulls cease to rejoin the herd, as they can no longer compete with the younger, more aggressive males. The old bachelors are called &quot;dagga boy&quot;s (&quot;mud covered&quot;), and are considered the most dangerous to humans.

===Vocalizations===
African buffaloes make various vocalizations. Many calls are lower-pitched versions of those emitted by domestic cattle. They emit low-pitched, two- to four-second calls intermittently at three- to six-second intervals to signal the herd to move. To signal to the herd to change direction, leaders emit &quot;gritty&quot;, &quot;creaking gate&quot; sounds. When moving to drinking places, some individuals make long &quot;maaa&quot; calls up to 20 times a minute. When being aggressive, they make explosive grunts that may last long or turn into a rumbling growl. Cows produce croaking calls when looking for their calves. Calves make a similar call of a higher pitch when in distress. When threatened by predators, they make drawn-out &quot;waaaa&quot; calls. Dominant individuals make calls to announce their presence and location. A version of the same call, but more intense, is emitted as a warning to an encroaching inferior. When grazing, they make various sounds, such as brief bellows, grunts, honks, and croaks.

===Reproduction===

Females reach sexual maturity at around five years of age while males are sexually matured at four to six. African buffaloes mate and give birth only during the rainy seasons. Birth peak takes place early in the season, while mating peaks later. A bull closely guards a cow that comes into heat, while keeping other bulls at bay. This is difficult, as cows are quite evasive and attract many males to the scene. By the time a cow is in full estrus, only the most dominant bull in the herd/subherd is there.

Cows first calve at five years of age, after a gestation period of 11.5 months. Newborn calves remain hidden in vegetation for the first few weeks while being nursed occasionally by the mother before joining the main herd. Older calves are held in the centre of the herd for safety. The maternal bond between mother and calf lasts longer than in most bovids. That bonding ends when a new calf is born, and the mother then keeps her previous offspring at bay with horn jabs. Nevertheless, the yearling follows its mother for another year or so. Males leave their mothers when they are two years old and join the bachelor groups. Young calves, unusually for bovids, suckle from behind their mothers, pushing their heads between the mothers&#x27; legs.

In the wild African buffaloes have an average lifespan of 11 years but they&#x27;ve been recorded to reach 22 years of age. In captivity they can live for a maximum of 29.5 years though they only live 16 years on average.

==Relationship with humans==
===Status===
The current status of the African buffalo is dependent on the animal&#x27;s value to both trophy hunters and tourists, paving the way for conservation efforts through anti-poaching patrols, village crop damage payouts, and CAMPFIRE payback programs to local areas.

The African buffalo is listed as Near threatened by the IUCN, with a decreasing population of 400,000 individuals. While some populations (subspecies) are decreasing, others will remain unchanged in the long term if large, healthy populations continue to persist in a substantial number of national parks, equivalent reserves and hunting zones in southern and eastern Africa.&quot;

In the most recent and available census data at continental scale, the total estimated numbers of the three savanna-type African buffalo subspecies (&quot;S. c. caffer&quot;, &quot;S. c. brachyceros&quot; and &quot;S. c. aequinoctialis&quot;) are at 513,000 individuals.

In the past, numbers of African buffaloes suffered their most severe collapse during the great rinderpest epidemic of the 1890s, which, coupled with pleuro-pneumonia, caused mortalities as high as 95% among livestock and wild ungulates.

Being a member of the big five game group, a term used to describe the five most dangerous animals to hunt, the Cape buffalo is a sought-after trophy, with some hunters paying over $10,000 for the opportunity to hunt one. The larger bulls are targeted for their trophy value, although in some areas, buffaloes are still hunted for meat.

=== Attacks ===
One of the &quot;big five&quot; African game, it is known as &quot;the Black Death&quot; or &quot;the widowmaker&quot;, and is widely regarded as a very dangerous animal. African buffaloes are sometimes reported to kill more people in Africa than any other animal, although the same claim is also made of hippopotamuses and crocodiles. These numbers may be somewhat overestimated; for example, in the country of Mozambique, attacks, especially fatal ones, were much less frequent on humans than those by hippos, and especially, Nile crocodiles. In Uganda, on the other hand, large herbivores were found to attack more people on average than lions or leopards and have a higher rate of inflicting fatalities during attacks than the predators (the African buffalo, in particular, killing humans in 49.5% of attacks on them), but hippos and even elephants may still kill more people per annum than buffaloes. African buffaloes are notorious among big-game hunters as very dangerous animals, with wounded animals reported to ambush and attack pursuers.

=== Domestication ===
The Cape buffalo hybridized with Indian water buffalo to create the Jafarabadi buffalo breed.

<text>William Yarrell (3 June 1784 – 1 September 1856) was an English zoologist, prolific writer, bookseller and naturalist admired by his contemporaries for his precise scientific work.

Yarrell is best known as the author of &quot;A History of British Fishes&quot; (2 vols., 1836) and &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; featuring 564 original engravings (in 3 vols., first ed. 1843, second ed. 1845, third ed. 1856). The latter went into several editions and was the standard reference work for a generation of British ornithologists. He described Bewick&#x27;s swan in 1830, distinguishing it from the larger whooper swan.

==Early life==
Yarrell was born in Duke Street, St James&#x27;s in London, to Francis Yarrell and his wife Sarah (née Blane). His father and uncle ran a newspaper agency and bookshop. He studied at Dr Nicholson&#x27;s school in Ealing. His father died in 1794 and the Yarrells moved the short distance to Great Ryder Street, where William lived the rest of his life. In 1802 he became a clerk with the Herries, Farquhar and Co. bank. In 1803 he and his cousin, Edward Jones, joined his father&#x27;s business. He sometimes left the business in Jones&#x27;s care, going into the countryside to fish and shoot. He acquired the reputation of being the best shot and the best angler in London, soon becoming an expert naturalist. He sent many bird specimens to Thomas Bewick, who engraved them as woodcuts for his own book of British birds.

==Career==
He joined the Royal Institution in 1817. His first publication, at the age of 40, was &quot;On the Occurrence of some Rare British Birds&quot; (1825). This was published in the 2nd volume of the &#x27;Zoological Journal&#x27; and he later became one of that journal&#x27;s editors. He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in 1825. He wrote in 1827 on the structure of the tracheae of birds and on plumage changes in pheasants. He corresponded and shared specimens with other naturalists including Thomas Bewick (from 1825), Sir William Jardine, Prideaux John Selby and Nicholas Aylward Vigors, as well as with the Cornish naturalist Jonathan Couch, who provided him with many specimens, especially of fish.

Yarrell was one of the original members of the Zoological Society of London. In 1833, he was a founder of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. He was acknowledged by John James Audubon both as a &quot;valued friend&quot; and for the information and &quot;precious specimens of birds and eggs, collected in the desolate regions of the extreme north.&quot; He served for many years as treasurer both of the Entomological Society and of the Linnean Society.

==Works==
Yarrell&#x27;s major works were &quot;A History of British Fishes&quot; (1836) and &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; (1843), the latter having the same title as the popular book by Thomas Bewick, published from 1797 to 1804, but with a different set of engravings.

&quot;British Birds&quot; was first published &quot;in thirty-seven parts of three sheets each, at intervals of two months; the first Part was issued in July 1837 and the last in May 1843.&quot; The sheets were then collected into two volumes, with the addition of &quot;many occurrences of rare birds and of some that were even new to Britain&quot;. The additional birds were listed and briefly described in the Preface and &quot;the new subjects have been engraved on single leaves, so paged, that the bookbinder may insert these separate leaves among the birds of the genus to which each respectively belongs.&quot;

&quot;British Birds&quot; was illustrated with drawings by Alexander Fussell. Yarrell thanks him for &quot;nearly five hundred of the drawings on wood here employed&quot;. The pen for the remaining drawings (the title-page asserts there are 520 in the book) is not stated. Yarrell also thanks John Thompson (1785–1866) and his sons for the &quot;very long series of engravings&quot; of the drawings, as well as his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley.

At the time of its release, Yarrell&#x27;s &quot;Birds&quot; was considered the best work on the subject both scientifically and artistically, as noted by Prof. Alfred Newton in his &quot;Prospectus&quot; to the 1871 edition, from which Yarrell&#x27;s introduction was removed along with the names of contributing artists under Thompson&#x27;s direction. Both Yarrell&#x27;s books were so popular that their publisher stated that sales exceeded £4,000. Thomas R. Forbes, in his biographical paper on Yarrell, writes that &quot;All [editions of &quot;Birds&quot;] are outstanding because of the author&#x27;s clear, narrative style, accuracy, careful scholarship and unassuming charm.&quot;

Yarrell&#x27;s last paper, &quot;On the Influence of the Sexual Organ in Modifying External Character&quot; (1856), described an experiment that disproved the belief that when a stag lacks a healthy testicle, it will fail to grow an antler on that side of the body.

==Legacy==
Yarrell died during a trip to Great Yarmouth and a memorial was erected in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s in Bayford, Hertfordshire, with his chosen epitaph &quot;He was the survivor of twelve brothers and sisters, who, with their father and mother, are all placed close to this spot&quot; together with William Wordsworth&#x27;s lines &quot;first and last, The earliest summon&#x27;d and the longest spared — Are here deposited.&quot;

Yarrell has a number of species named after him, including the birds yellow-faced siskin (&quot;Carduelis yarrellii&quot;) and Chilean woodstar (&quot;Eulidia yarrellii&quot;) and the fish Yarrell&#x27;s blenny (&quot;Chirolophis ascanii&quot;). The British subspecies of the white wagtail, the pied wagtail (&quot;Motacilla alba yarrellii&quot;), was also named for him.

<doc id="564986" wikidata="Q1046295" url="?curid=564986" title="The Princess Diaries (film)">
<text>The Princess Diaries is a 2001 American coming-of-age comedy film produced by Walt Disney Pictures, directed by Garry Marshall, and written by Gina Wendkos. Based on Meg Cabot&#x27;s 2000 young adult novel of the same name, it stars Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews, with a supporting cast consisting of Héctor Elizondo, Heather Matarazzo, Mandy Moore, Caroline Goodall, and Robert Schwartzman. The plot follows Mia Thermopolis (Hathaway), a shy American teenager who discovers she is heir to the throne of a European kingdom. Under the tutelage of her estranged grandmother (Andrews), the kingdom&#x27;s reigning queen, Mia must choose whether to claim or renounce the title she has inherited.

Feeling confident about the novel&#x27;s film potential, Cabot&#x27;s agent pursued producer Debra Martin Chase about adapting &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; into a feature-length film, an idea she pitched to Disney upon reading the book. After obtaining the film rights, Disney originally greenlit the project under the title &quot;The Princess of Tribeca&quot;, reverting it once its setting was changed from New York to San Francisco, where the majority of the film was shot between September and December 2000. Marshall agreed to direct because he found the story ideal for family entertainment. Despite having little involvement in the film&#x27;s development, Cabot was consulted about various changes to its story and characters. Hathaway won the lead role over several established young actresses in her motion picture debut, while &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; commemorated the end of Andrews&#x27;s semi-retirement from acting and return to Disney films, her first since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964).

&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on July 29, 2001, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 3. The film was an unexpected commercial success, grossing over $165 million worldwide. Despite receiving mixed reviews for its plot and themes, Hathaway&#x27;s performance was widely praised by film critics. Ranking among the most profitable films of 2001, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; defied industry expectations as pundits had expected the film to underperform due to its G rating and subject matter. The film&#x27;s success is credited with establishing Hathaway as a bankable actress and reviving Andrews&#x27;s film career. A sequel, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;, was released in 2004, and a third installment has been in development.

==Plot==

Mia Thermopolis is a student at Grove High School residing with her single mother, Helen, in a refurbished firehouse in San Francisco. Unpopular among her peers, Mia suffers from a fear of public speaking while harboring a crush on Josh Bryant, and is often teased by his popular girlfriend, Lana Thomas. Mia&#x27;s only friends are social outcast Lilly Moscovitz and her older brother, Michael, who secretly harbors feelings for Mia.

Mia learns from her estranged paternal grandmother, Clarisse, that she is the sole heir to the small European kingdom of Genovia, having inherited the throne from her recently deceased father, Philippe. Clarisse is determined to make Mia into a refined princess so that she may one day rule the kingdom over which Clarisse currently presides. Overwhelmed by the discovery, Mia initially refuses until her mother convinces her to attend her grandmother&#x27;s &quot;princess lessons&quot; on the condition that she need not make her final decision until the Genovian Independence Day Ball in three weeks&#x27; time.

Mia receives a glamorous makeover and a limousine chauffeured by Joe, the queen&#x27;s head of security and confidant, who becomes a father figure to her. Mia&#x27;s transformation causes her schoolmates to treat her differently, while her increasingly hectic schedule strains her relationship with Lilly. To appease her best friend, Mia tells Lilly the truth and swears her to secrecy. However, the public soon learns that Mia is a princess after the secret is sold to the press by Paolo, the hairdresser responsible for Mia&#x27;s makeover, and paparazzi begin to pursue her relentlessly. Although Mia embarrasses herself at her first state dinner, Clarisse admits that she found her clumsiness endearing and suggests that they spend quality time together, canceling their lessons for the following afternoon. While bonding, Clarisse explains that although Mia&#x27;s parents loved each other, they divorced amicably in order to pursue their own passions, Philippe remaining in Genovia to eventually become king, and Helen returning to America with Mia to offer her a &quot;normal&quot; childhood.

As Mia&#x27;s popularity grows, Josh invites her to attend a beach party with him. Mia accepts, causing her to neglect Lilly and forgo her plans with Michael. The paparazzi ambush Mia at the beach party. Josh kisses Mia in front of the paparazzi to get his &quot;15 minutes of fame&quot;, while Lana helps the paparazzi photograph Mia wearing only a towel; both photographs are printed in the newspaper the following day. Finding the photos inappropriate for a princess, Clarisse admonishes Mia for her behavior, after which a humiliated Mia promises to renounce her title. Joe reminds Clarisse that Mia is still both a teenager and her granddaughter, suggesting that the queen reacted too harshly.

After making amends with Lilly, Mia gets back at Josh during PE and finally stands up to Lana for bullying a schoolmate. Mia invites both Lilly and Michael to the ball but Michael declines, still heartbroken over Mia&#x27;s initial dismissal. After Clarisse apologizes to Mia for scolding her, she states that Mia must publicly renounce the throne at the ball. Terrified by the prospect, Mia plans to run away until she discovers a touching letter from her late father and relents. Mia&#x27;s car malfunctions while driving to the ball, stranding her in a downpour until she is retrieved by Joe.

When they finally arrive, Mia, still wet and untidy from the rain, accepts her role as Princess of Genovia with Clarisse, while Helen and Lilly look on proudly. After changing into a gown, Mia accompanies Clarisse into the ballroom where Michael, who has accepted Mia&#x27;s apology, invites her to dance before proceeding to the courtyard, where they confess their feelings for each other and share their first kiss. In the final scene, Mia is shown traveling to Genovia in a private plane with her pet cat Fat Louie, and writes in her diary that she plans to relocate to Genovia with her mother.

==Production==

=== Development ===
&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is based on the 2000 young adult novel of the same name by author Meg Cabot. Cabot&#x27;s agent believed the first &quot;Princess Diaries&quot; book showed promising film potential, and pursued Debra Martin Chase, who had recently produced the television film &quot;Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein&#x27;s Cinderella&quot; (1997), about adapting the novel into a film due to the story&#x27;s shared &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; and &quot;Cinderella-type&quot; themes. Having enjoyed the book herself, Chase convinced Disney to adapt it into a feature-length project. Disney chairman Peter Schneider optioned the project in an &quot;effort to re-establish the Disney brand for live-action family films&quot;. Disney paid Cabot $4,000 for the film rights, although some media outlets reported that Cabot had been offered &quot;mid- to low-six figures&quot;. Cabot recalled that Disney&#x27;s decision to adapt &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; resulted in a promotion at her own job, prior to which publishers had been unwilling to publish her novel due to concerns that some of its content was inappropriate for young readers. HarperCollins showed interest in Cabot&#x27;s manuscript in 1999, followed by Disney shortly afterward. 

By August 1999, the film was greenlit by Disney who agreed to produce it with singer Whitney Houston&#x27;s BrownHouse Productions, and Cabot&#x27;s manuscript was forwarded to potential screenwriters. Chase developed the script with screenwriter Gina Wendkos. Although Cabot did not write the screenplay herself, she discussed changes deemed necessary for translating the story from page to screen with Chase, maintaining that &quot;The essence of the story, or the message, of staying true to yourself ... still comes through&quot;. Garry Marshall was enlisted as director, with Houston and Chase producing alongside Mario Iscovich. Marshall had already been pitching ideas to Disney executive Nina Jacobson before he was hired. He found &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; ideal family entertainment, and was particularly drawn to the idea of &quot;a young girl turning into a woman and realizing that she can have a positive effect on the world&quot;, hoping it would appeal to girls, boys, and adults. Furthermore, the director admitted to being fond of &quot;female wish-fulfillment and empowerment movies&quot;. However, Marshall nearly turned down the film due to a typo in its original treatment that read &quot;The Princess Dairies&quot;, prompting him to mistake it for a movie about cows. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was Houston&#x27;s first feature film production venture, and her studio&#x27;s second film after &quot;Cinderella&quot;. Houston and Chase hoped that &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; would be BrownHouse Productions&#x27; first in a series of female-led wish-fulfillment films, originally planning to remake the musical film &quot;Sparkle&quot; (1976) as a follow-up. Chase recalled that, at the time, Hollywood believed that while girls would willingly see a film intended for boys, it was difficult to convince boys to see a female-oriented film, but were encouraged by the success of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Parent Trap&quot; (1998).

&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was optioned to challenge the belief that children were losing interest in live-action films targeted towards girls, and Marshall was hired specifically to make a G-rated film &quot;edgy and crazy and maybe something the adults will like&quot;. The film differs considerably from the novel. Initially intended to be set in New York like Cabot&#x27;s book, the film was originally called &quot;The Princess of Tribeca&quot;. The title was reverted once the setting was changed to San Francisco, California, a decision Marshall made because the latter is home to both himself and his granddaughters, to whom the film is dedicated. Although Mia and Lilly remain environmentally and politically conscious, the filmmakers softened some of the more political aspects of their personalities to prevent the film from resembling &quot;a political diatribe&quot;. Some aspects of the script were inspired by Cabot&#x27;s own childhood, particularly when her mother began dating one of her teachers shortly after her father&#x27;s death. Despite being consulted about such changes, Cabot distanced herself from the creative process to avoid compromising her vision for future novels, preferring that the book and film exist in separate universes. Cabot maintains that she had little creative input in the film, elaborating, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Garry Marshall needs &#x27;help&#x27; to make a movie… from a novelist who has absolutely no experience in film-making.&quot; Although Cabot admitted that Disney consulted with her before making changes, she described their conversations as more informative than collaborative. Cabot acknowledged the challenge of adapting a 300-page novel, which she had written in the form of a diary, into a 90-page screenplay but was ultimately satisfied with the final results and Marshall&#x27;s direction.

===Casting===
Chase decided that the main cast&#x27;s ethnicity would remain faithful to the novel because Mia and Clarisse rule a European country, and the producer preferred to &quot;make good movies&quot; as opposed to only African-American films. Anne Hathaway was cast in the lead role of Mia Thermopolis after Juliette Lewis turned it down. Aged eighteen at the time, &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was Hathaway&#x27;s first major film role, for which she auditioned during a 26-hour layover in Los Angeles, California while traveling to New Zealand to film &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot; (2001). Her only prior acting credit had been in the short-lived television series &quot;Get Real&quot;. Hathaway recalled that she fell out of her chair out of nervousness, and her inherent clumsiness is credited with impressing Marshall. Several established young actresses had been considered for the role, including Reese Witherspoon, Kirsten Dunst, Alicia Silverstone, Jessica Biel, Claire Danes, Kate Hudson, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Brittany Murphy, Katie Holmes, Christina Applegate, Kate Beckinsale and Eva Mendes, while Liv Tyler was deemed a front-runner. Christy Carlson Romano was unable to audition due to scheduling conflicts while filming the Disney Channel series &quot;Even Stevens&quot;. Marshall&#x27;s granddaughters ultimately convinced the director to cast Hathaway over Tyler because they felt that she possessed the more &quot;princess-like hair&quot;. The actress was cast based solely on her audition, without performing a screen test. Although Marshall believed several other candidates seemed capable of embodying Mia&#x27;s comedic side, he felt only Hathaway possessed &quot;the grace and authority&quot; required to deliver the character&#x27;s climactic speech. Hathaway identified with her character&#x27;s personality and struggles with self-confidence, drawing similarities between Mia&#x27;s shyness and her own awkwardness in high school. For Marshall, Hathaway&#x27;s appearance and performance were reminiscent of Julia Roberts, whom he had directed to great success in the romantic comedy &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990). He described her as a fusion of Roberts, comedian Harpo Marx, and his own sister, actress-director Penny Marshall. Hathaway gained weight for the role to closer resemble &quot;a regular teen&quot;.Julie Andrews, who had been semi-retired from acting at the time, was cast as Clarisse Renaldi. Marshall personally invited Andrews to discuss the film with him; she identified the director as &quot;the hook&quot; that ultimately convinced her to accept the role, having already been a fan of his work. She accepted solely based on her conversations with Marshall without reading the script. Although Sophia Loren is rumored to have been offered the part, Marshall insists that Andrews was the first and only actor he considered, having been a fan of hers since Broadway&#x27;s &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956). Known for portraying nobility throughout her career, Andrews incorporated knowledge she had acquired about European royalty and Britain&#x27;s royal family into her performance; Elizabeth II herself had knighted Andrews a Dame of the British Empire one year prior. Marshall allowed Andrews significant creative freedom over Clarisse&#x27;s portrayal. Cabot was initially wary of Andrews&#x27;s casting, fearing the actress was too kind to play such a stern character, but ultimately felt her portrayal possessed the necessary combination of regality and grandmotherly warmth. Andrews also used the opportunity to mentor Hathaway, although she maintains that the younger actress required very little training due to her natural instincts. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was Andrews&#x27;s first Disney film since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), 37 years prior.

Marshall cast Heather Matarazzo as Lilly Moscovitz after casting director Marcia Ross introduced them to each other, promising that Matarazzo was different from other actresses he had interviewed for the part. Matarazzo participated in a chemistry reading opposite Hathaway after auditioning for Marshall. Although Hathaway believes the two actresses had met several times prior to filming &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, Matarazzo claims she does not remember meeting Hathaway before their chemistry reading. The actress cites Marshall as her favourite director, whose positive energy she described as unrivaled by his peers. Héctor Elizondo was cast as Joe, Mia&#x27;s limousine driver and Clarisse&#x27;s head of security. Elizondo is known for appearing in all 18 films Marshall directed. Singer Mandy Moore was cast as Lana Thomas, her first credited film role. Marshall was the first film director with whom Moore, sixteen years old at the time, ever worked, and appreciated that most of her co-stars were similar to her own age age. Robert Schwartzman was cast as Michael, Mia&#x27;s love interest and Lilly&#x27;s brother. His real-life band Rooney has a cameo appearance as garage band Flypaper, with Schwartzman playing their lead singer. The musicians perform &quot;Blueside&quot;, one of Rooney&#x27;s original songs. Schwartzman wanted to change his last name in the credits to Cage in honor of his cousin Nicolas Cage, but the film&#x27;s promotional material had already been finalized. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; remains Schwartzman&#x27;s only major film role.

Marshall cast several of his own family members in supporting and minor roles. His daughter Kathleen plays Clarisse&#x27;s secretary, Charlotte Kutaway. The character, whose surname is only revealed during the end credits, was named after how often she is used in cutaway shots, and her role references the filmmaking technique of cutting away to someone whenever something goes awry. Marshall&#x27;s wife appears as a ball guest, while his twin granddaughters Lily and Charlotte, the same granddaughters who inspired him to cast Hathaway, appear as a pair of schoolgirls asking for Mia&#x27;s autograph. Marshall himself has a brief cameo during the Genovian Independence Day Ball, alongside sister Penny. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown portrayed himself in a cameo appearance, during which he is briefly interviewed upon arriving at the same ball.

=== Further writing ===
Additional adjustments were made to the script once the cast was finalized. Marshall was constantly trying to make the film funnier because Disney had challenged him to incorporate humor into the G-rated project. Marshall drew from experience writing for the family-oriented shows &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, whose scripts he revisited for inspiration. Matarazzo described the set as a collaborative and familial environment fostered by Marshall, consisting of birthday parties for cast and crew members, including Marshall himself.

Mia&#x27;s grandmother, nicknamed &quot;Grandmere&quot; in the novel, is depicted as considerably kinder in the film. Disney&#x27;s decision to have Mia&#x27;s father be deceased is among the film&#x27;s most significant deviations from its source material, in which he is both alive and plays an integral role. The producers decided to kill off Mia&#x27;s father to expand Clarisse&#x27;s role, for which they had wanted Andrews cast from the beginning. Once she learned of Andrews&#x27; involvement, Cabot approved that Mia&#x27;s father be eliminated, much of whose dialogue was re-written for Mia&#x27;s grandmother. Upon Marshall&#x27;s request, Andrews suggested that the fictional country of Genovia be famous for its pears, after which the set was decorated with artificial pears and pear-shaped statues. Marshall wrote Hathaway&#x27;s childhood struggles with wearing a retainer into the film; the actress filmed a scene wearing the same retainer she had worn as a child. Elizondo and Andrews campaigned for a romantic relationship between their characters, an idea that originated during a table reading in which the actors improvised saying &quot;you&#x27;re cute&quot; to each other. The actors improvised their dance sequence, which Elizondo credits with developing his character.

Marshall worked with Larry Miller, who portrays Mia&#x27;s hair stylist Paolo, to improvise humorous moments, such as shrieking upon seeing Mia for the first time and drawing his styling tools from his pockets as though they are pistols. Wendkos said Miller&#x27;s Paolo was deliberately written to be &quot;over-the-top&quot;. &quot;Not you, I don&#x27;t even know you&quot;, one of Matarazzo&#x27;s most oft-quoted lines which she utters to someone while running down the street, was entirely improvised at the suggestion of Chase. Joe recites &quot;No one can make you feel inferior without your consent&quot; to Mia, a famous quote originally by former United States First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Mia recites one of Juliet&#x27;s soliloquies from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, a deliberate reference to the fact that Hathaway shares her full name with Shakespeare&#x27;s wife. Houston conceived the scene in which Mia smears her ice cream cone on Lana&#x27;s cheerleader uniform. Wendkos spent more effort revising Mia&#x27;s makeover sequence than any other scene in the filming, wanting to achieve a &quot;clearer progression from the ugly duckling to the ingenue&quot;, as per Marshall&#x27;s request.

The film contains several references to &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, another film directed by Marshall to which &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; has often been compared. In addition to sharing a &quot;&quot;Pygmalion&quot;-esque transformation story&quot;, both films share several cast members, including Elizondo and Miller. Most notably, actor Alan Kent, portraying a waiter, delivers the same line he once delivered to Julia Roberts&#x27; character in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; during the scene in which Mia accidentally breaks a drinking glass.

===Filming===

==== Set and locations ====
&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was filmed on a budget of $26 million. Principal photography took place from September to December 2000, although filming was originally scheduled to begin one month before Cabot&#x27;s novel was published. It was filmed on Stage 2 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, the same sound stage where &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; starring Andrews had been filmed during the 1960s. The stage was later renamed the &quot;Julie Andrews Stage&quot; in honor of the actress. Andrews recalled having to constantly walk up and down the set&#x27;s main staircase while struggling to remain regal and composed in appearance. Additionally, Marshall resided in the same house that Andrews herself had rented while filming &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, having lived in the building since 1974.
Exterior shooting in San Francisco took place over two and a half weeks. The former Engine Company No. 43 fire station on Brazil Avenue in the Excelsior District was used as Mia and Helen&#x27;s home, with its interior reproduced in the studio. Mia&#x27;s private school Grove High School, was represented by Bob Lurie&#x27;s recently vacated mansion and the rooftop of the Hamlin School. The cable car accident was filmed at Broadway and Taylor Streets. However, the beach party sequence was filmed in Malibu; the production designers decorated Zuma Beach to resemble San Francisco&#x27;s Baker Beach. Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College in Los Angeles, formerly the Doheny Mansion, was used as the location for The Genovian Consulate.

To help Hathaway feel more comfortable on set, many of its props belonged to the actress&#x27; family. Mia&#x27;s photograph of her late father is a photograph of Hathaway&#x27;s own father, Gerald Hathaway. Gerald also briefly portrays the character during a flashback sequence in which he writes a letter to Mia. Mia&#x27;s pet cat Fat Louie was portrayed by four different cats, one of whom was owned by Hathaway herself. Each cat served a different purpose: one was meant to be carried, another sat still for extended periods of time, a third was used for jumping and stunts, and the final (Hathaway&#x27;s) is featured during the film&#x27;s final scene. During the state dinner in which a guest&#x27;s arm catches fire, the fire was intended to be extinguished once the actor placed his arm in a nearby ice bucket. However, when the fire persisted, Hathaway panicked and doused it with a glass of water, an improvisation that was kept in the film. Hathaway tripped and fell while filming a scene in which she is walking atop bleachers during the rain, but continued to recite her lines as though nothing had happened. Marshall found the unscripted incident funny and decided to retain it. Matarazzo, who had been filming the scene with Hathaway, identified this moment as &quot;a testament to the kind of person that she is, not just professionally but personally… You fall, you laugh, and you keep going&quot;. She also identified this as her favorite moment while filming. While filming the final dance sequence, the crew played Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989) for the cast to dance to; multiple takes were required because the cast kept instinctively lip syncing its lyrics. The track was dubbed by a different song in the final edit.

==== Costume design ====
Costume designer Gary Jones, who had worked with Marshall on prior films, was drawn to &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; due to the wide range of costumes required for its characters, describing the project as &quot;a costume designer&#x27;s dream come true&quot;. Jones worked closely with Andrews to design Clarisse&#x27;s costumes, drawing inspiration from Chanel, Bill Blass, and Christian Dior. The gown Andrews wears to the state dinner was handmade in China, and is an homage to her role as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;&#x27;s Eliza Doolittle. Jones envisioned Mia as a character who is shy about her body at first, opting to dress her in layers consisting of long sleeves and loose-fitting garments. The character&#x27;s periwinkle state dinner gown was inspired by Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, with Jones describing the dress as an homage to the Renaissance period and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, accessorizing it with an 18-carat diamond ring.

Both Hathaway and Andrews&#x27;s tiaras were designed and custom-made for them, with the designers ensuring that both characters&#x27; crowns were appropriate for their age. The tiara and jewelry Andrews wears during the final scene of &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; consists of half a million dollars’ worth of diamonds, loaned to the production by jeweler Harry Winston, with whom Jones worked closely to obtain several unique jewels. A security guard followed Andrews at all times to both protect her and ensure all jewelry was returned at the end of each day. Andrews&#x27;s peach taffeta ballgown was accessorized with a 100-carat necklace comprising four rows of diamonds. Hathaway&#x27;s tiara was considerably less expensive, consisting of cubic zirconia as opposed to authentic jewels. The crowns and tiaras worn by both actresses are preserved by the Walt Disney Archives, into which they were inducted in 2016 to commemorate the film&#x27;s 15th anniversary.

Hathaway donned false eyebrows and a wig to make her character&#x27;s makeover more dramatic. Hathaway&#x27;s hair piece was nicknamed &quot;The Beast&quot;, while her eyebrows required one hour to apply; each strand of hair was individually glued to her brow. At times Hathaway was required to leave the set in full costume, claiming that she &quot;never felt so alone in [her] entire life&quot;.

== Themes ==

Andrews explained that the film is as much &quot;about what you are inside and the responsibility and just plain old hard work that goes into being a princess&quot; as it is &quot;about the trappings of being a princess&quot;. Hathaway identified &quot;remaining true to yourself&quot; among the film&#x27;s core values, describing Mia&#x27;s transformation as both emotional and psychological, in addition to physical. Hathaway elaborated that, despite the makeover, her character most importantly learns that &quot;life shouldn&#x27;t be about what the rest of the world can do for her&quot; but rather &quot;doing everything in her power to help other people&quot;, emphasizing her emotional transformation over her physical one. Chase regards the plot as an &quot;empowerment story&quot;, identifying &quot;the power to be anything that you want to be&quot; as its core message. Chase elaborated, &quot;In the beginning, Mia looks in the mirror and doesn&#x27;t think she&#x27;s princess material at all&quot; but ultimately &quot;comes to believe that she is&quot;. Houston echoed that being a princess &quot;doesn&#x27;t mean they have to come from royalty&quot; but rather &quot;how you feel inside about yourself it&#x27;s how you treat yourself and love yourself that really matters.&quot; &quot;Bustle&quot; contributor Veronica Walsingham wrote that the film explores feminism, identity, family, girlhood, and duty, believing that &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; &quot;is a feminist dream of fully developed female characters whose arcs aren&#x27;t dependent on male characters&quot;, additionally passing the Bechdel test. A critic for &quot;Time Out&quot; wrote that the film discusses &quot;responsibility, surrogacy, rites of passage and the value of friendship&quot;. Writers for &quot;USA Today&quot; noted that, despite being a comedy, the film contains deeper topics such as &quot;familial bonds, self-worth and stepping out of your shell&quot;.

Most of Marshall&#x27;s films revolve around themes &quot;of recognizing and embracing one&#x27;s own unique qualities and gifts&quot;. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s Liam Lacey observed that the film adheres to a traditional fairy tale plot: &quot;a fairy godmother, and the lowly girl who becomes a princess, complete with tiara, the dress and a plump frog to be transformed into Prince Charming&quot;. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; has been noted to contain some romantic comedy elements. The film has also drawn comparisons to &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, a play that provided the basis for the stage musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, in which Andrews coincidentally played the role of Eliza Doolittle; Mia has been compared to Eliza. Identifying &quot;Pygmalion&quot; as &quot;the model for all subsequent dramas about the recreation of social identity&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; film critic Philip French cited &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; as one of several &quot;makeover drama[s]&quot; inspired by the play. Similarly, &quot;HuffPost&quot; contributor Matthew recognized the film among several &quot;recent approaches&quot; to the &quot;Pygmalion&quot; story. Jacobs Kristal Brent Zook of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that Clarisse &quot;must ... remake the gawky girl into a vision of regal grace&quot; in &quot;true Henry Higgins fashion&quot;, a character from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; film critic Moira Macdonald joked that Andrews &quot;play[s] Henry Higgins to young Anne Hathaway&#x27;s Eliza&quot;. Also writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Michael O&#x27;Sullivan similarly observed that &quot;Most of the comedy mileage comes from the &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; scenario, in which Mia&#x27;s initially frumpy appearance and klutzy manner are eliminated through a regime of industrial-strength cosmetology and boot camp-style finishing school.&quot;

Nanciann Cherry, writing for &quot;The Blade&quot;, reviewed the film as &quot;no more and no less than a live-action Cinderella, all dolled up for the 21st century&quot;. Amy Meadows, writing for &quot;The Tech&quot;, remarked that the film would hold few surprises for anyone who has seen &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, or any other fairy tale. The film&#x27;s main characters react differently towards Mia&#x27;s physical transformation; Lilly fears that Mia will abandon her, Michael&#x27;s attraction towards her only grows, and Lana feels threatened by Mia&#x27;s royal lineage and sudden popularity within her own school. Some critics were concerned that the film&#x27;s message might encourage younger viewers &quot;that all awkward teens need do to find contentment is get a makeover and wait for a hitherto unknown royal grandmother to come lay a crown on their heads.&quot;

==Music==
Houston and BrownHouse Productions were heavily involved in curating music for the film, which Kristal Brent Zook of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; observed &quot;displays more girl power and ethnic flavor than the film does&quot;. Dawn Soler served as the film&#x27;s music supervisor, and Moore recorded a cover of Connie Francis&#x27; &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot; for the soundtrack. Composer John Debney was recruited to score the film. Long-time friends with Disney executive Bill Green, Green felt that Debney would complement the film and personally recommended him to Marshall. Debney identified &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; as one of the films he is most proud to have worked on, explaining that the project holds an &quot;emotional connection&quot; because it reminds him of his mother.

The official soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on July 24, 2001. Described as largely a collection of pop rock, teen pop, and dance-pop tracks, the soundtrack features contributions from artists BBMak, Aaron Carter, Backstreet Boys, Myra, Hanson and B*Witched. AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares reviewed that the album consists of mostly &quot;slick, virtually interchangeable singles ... a few tracks, for better or worse, are particularly distinctive&quot;, and felt that the album could have benefited from more originality as the Backstreet Boys&#x27; track &quot;What Makes You Different (Makes You Beautiful)&quot; implies. A soundtrack consisting exclusively of the film&#x27;s orchestral score was released on December 11, 2001, credited to Debney.

==Release==

Disney attempted to market the film cleverly to dispel the stigma associated with G-rated films at the time. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; premiered on July 29, 2001, at the El Capitan Theatre. Prior to introducing the film, Marshall encouraged audience members to chant &quot;G is a good rating&quot;, deliberately referencing the lack of G-rated films released that year. A princess-themed tea party was hosted following the screening, with cast members Andrews, Hathaway, Matarazzo, Moore, Goodall, Schwartzman, Von Detten and Burbano attending. In addition to Jacobson, Disney executives Bob Iger, Richard Cook, Mark Vahradian, Chuck Viane and Oren Aviv were present, as well as actors Spencer Treat Clark, David Hasselhoff, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Michelle Trachtenberg. Additionally, the tea party featured appearances by actors portraying well-known Disney Princesses, including Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora and Belle.

Disney postponed the release of &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot;, which Hathaway had filmed before &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, to allow the latter film to take precedence at the box office, feeling confident that &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;&#x27; impending success would in turn bolster the performance of &quot;The Other Side of Heaven&quot;. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was released in theaters on August 3, 2001, becoming a surprise success and sleeper hit. The film opened in 2,537 theaters throughout North America and earned more than $23.2 million during its opening weekend, completing in third place behind &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; achieved the second-highest opening earnings for a live-action G-rated film, behind &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; (1996) at $33.5 million. The film&#x27;s box office returns surprised several commentators, far exceeding pundits&#x27; expectations. Analysts originally estimated that the film would earn between $13 and $15 million.

&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was the only G-rated film released during summer 2001. According to Breuse Hickman of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;, the last live-action film to earn a G rating prior to &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; was Disney&#x27;s &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot; in 1996, a live-action remake of their own 1961 animated film of the same name. ABC News believes that the comedy&#x27;s strong opening numbers benefited from it being one of 2001&#x27;s few G-rated releases amidst several of PG-13-and R-rated films, to which parents reportedly rushed to see with their children, while Allen Wan of MarketWatch joked that the family friendly rating &quot;didn&#x27;t scare off mature audiences&quot;. However, The Dove Foundation argued that family fare such as &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is typically 11 times more profitable than adult-oriented films, although 12 times as many R-rated films were released between 1989 and 2003. Dove Foundation CEO Dick Rolfe received the film&#x27;s release as &quot;an experiment to test the waters to see if there is a market for truly wholesome family entertainment at the theaters&quot;. &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; ultimately grossed $165.3 million worldwide, collecting $108.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $57.1 million in other territories. The film&#x27;s box office returns were deemed remarkably high considering the fact that its lead role was played by a newcomer. The film ranks among the highest-grossing and most profitable of 2001.

To commemorate the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary in April 2012, the film was released on Blu-ray to coincide with Disney&#x27;s National Princess Week and the release of Andrews&#x27;s book &quot;The Very Fairy Princess: Here Comes The Flower Girl!&quot;. A double-disk paired with &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;, the release was sold exclusively at Target.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; received mixed reviews from film critics upon release. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 49% of 118 critics surveyed reviewed the film positively, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A charming, if familiar, makeover movie for young teenage girls&quot;. Metacritic assigned the film a weighted score of 52 based on 27 reviews, indicating &quot;Mixed or average reviews&quot;. Ed Park, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, reviewed the film as &quot;a modest, enjoyable fairy tale that easily outcharms its animated stablemates of the past decade&quot;, the success of which he attributed to Hathaway and Andrews&#x27; performances. Calling &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; &quot;an ideal family film&quot;, Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commended Marshall&#x27;s ability to &quot;mak[e] make-believe seem real&quot; while describing Wendkos&#x27; screenplay as &quot;skillfully adapted&quot; and praising Andrews&#x27;s performance. Film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum commended Marshall for directing the film and its large cast &quot;with avuncular affection and, by his standards, a minimum of court jestering&quot;, highlighting Andrews and Oh&#x27;s contributions.
Film critic Mick LaSalle called &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; Marshall&#x27;s best film and Andrews&#x27; best work in years, praising her sense of humor. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s Michael O&#x27;Sullivan said the film has enough material to appeal to older audiences, despite its younger demographic. Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s Liam Lacey criticized the film for wasting the comedic opportunities offered by the book by focusing on Mia&#x27;s school and romantic relationships at the expense of her grandmother&#x27;s training, but considered Andrews to have been perfectly cast. Praising the cast&#x27;s chemistry, Loren King, writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, credited Andrews&#x27;s performance with &quot;kick[ing] the film&#x27;s class quotient up several notches&quot;. Branding the film &quot;a surprisingly sophisticated comedy&quot; that avoids common teen tropes, Asher Price, reviewing for &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, enjoyed the training sequences but felt Mia&#x27;s confidence is drawn solely from her physical transformation, describing the latter as &quot;The only disturbing part of the film&quot;.

Hathaway&#x27;s performance was widely praised by film critics, as was her chemistry with Andrews. LaSalle wrote, &quot;Hathaway is not a natural comic, but her acting has a truthfulness that gives &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; its emotional core. She is also a chameleon, who, from the most unpromising of beginnings, blossoms before our eyes into near- Audrey Hepburn-level loveliness&quot;, additionally commending her chemistry with Matarazzo. Elvis Mitchell, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found the film to be merely &quot;a blandly reassuring comedy&quot; but described it as perfectly cast, hailing Hathaway as &quot;royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features&quot;. However, Mitchell felt that her character becomes less interesting once she undergoes her makeover and predicted that some viewers will find the sequence problematic. Similarly, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;&#x27; Moira Macdonald felt that the film could have done without Mia&#x27;s &quot;teen-queen makeover, which made her look alarmingly like a junior Julia Roberts&quot;, but wrote that Andrews &quot;tucks the film into her carpet bag and walks away with it&quot;, crowning her &quot;pure screen royalty&quot;.

Even most of the film&#x27;s detractors praised Hathaway&#x27;s efforts, and several critics compared her to Julia Roberts. Christine Dolen of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; felt the script &quot;leaves much to be desired&quot; outside of Hathaway&#x27;s comedic timing. Asher Price, reviewing for &quot;The Denver Post&quot;, lauded Andrews&#x27;s contribution while identifying Hathaway as &quot;a good match for&quot; the veteran actress. &quot;ReelViews&quot;&#x27; James Berardinelli panned the film, accusing Marshall of exploring a predictable plot &quot;in a thoroughly uninteresting way&quot; by &quot;reducing characters to types and heaping mounds of saccharine and false sentiment on top&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert dismissed the film as a &quot;swamp of recycled ugly duckling stories, with occasional pauses in the marsh of sitcom cliches and the bog of Idiot Plots&quot;, finding it predictable, poorly edited and Hathaway too physically attractive to offer a convincing transformation. &quot;Salon&quot; film critic Stephanie Zacharek reviewed the film as &quot;so aggressively bland and inoffensive that it practically recedes from the screen&quot;. Zacharek is also one of the few film critics to deride the leads&#x27; performances, dismissing Andrews as &quot;so shellacked and precise ... that it makes you want to run out of the theater and roll around in the dirt&quot;.

===Accolades===

===Home media===
The film was released in DVD and VHS on December 18, 2001. The film was re-release in double DVD on August 3, 2004. The film was released as part of a Blu-ray and DVD double feature with &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; on May 15, 2012.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;, was released on August 11, 2004, with Marshall returning to direct, Debra Martin Chase and Whitney Houston producing, and Hathaway, Andrews, Elizondo, Matarazzo, and Miller reprising their roles alongside John Rhys-Davies, Chris Pine and Callum Blue as new characters. There had been constant speculation about whether or not a third film would be released for several years. Several cast members had expressed interest in returning for a third installment, particularly Hathaway and Andrews. In 2016, Marshall revealed that he had discussed the possibility of having a third film set in New York with both actresses. Interest had bolstered following Marshall&#x27;s death in 2016, with Cabot revealing that a script for the third film already exists, indicating that the threequel would most likely be a tribute to Marshall.

In January 2019, Hathaway confirmed there is a script being written for a third film and that she, Andrews, and producer Chase are on board. However, Andrews said in a June 2022 interview that she felt a third film would be unlikely and too late, especially since Marshall had already died.

On November 15, 2022, it was reported that Aadrita Mukerji was writing a script for a third &quot;Princess Diaries&quot; film, as a continuation of the previous films.
Neither Hathaway nor Andrews had been confirmed to return.
In October 2024, Adele Lim was announced as director of a second sequel, &quot;The Princess Diaries 3&quot;, with Hathaway set to return and produce.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Elite Daily&quot; contributor Alana Altmann described the film as &quot;a bonafide fave of &#x27;90s and 2000s kids alike&quot;. Writing for the same publication, Kristen Perrone called the film &quot;an essential part of the childhoods of anyone who grew up in the early 2000s&quot;. Andrews attributes the film&#x27;s longevity to new generations re-discovering it approximately every seven years. The actress believes the film continues to resonate with audiences due to its strong morals about responsibility, obligation, decency, growing up, and self-discovery. &quot;Seventeen&quot; ranked &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; the 10th best &quot;Best Teen Movies You Can&#x27;t Grow Up Without Watching&quot;. The scene in which Mia undergoes a physical makeover has garnered significant attention, with several media publications ranking it among the greatest makeover sequences in film history. E! contributor McKenna Aiello identified the montage as &quot;the first scene that comes to mind&quot; when remembering &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, a sentiment with which &quot;InStyle&quot; agreed. Lauren Hubbard, writing for &quot;Allure&quot;, believes the film &quot;may very well be one of the single greatest makeover movies of our generation&quot;, publishing a list of &quot;11 Beauty Lessons We Learned from &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;&quot;. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;&#x27;s Eliza Thompson wrote &quot;Few makeover movies hold up as well as &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;&quot;. Katie Rosseinsky of &quot;Grazia&quot; credits the film with introducing &quot;one of the best makeover sequences in teen movie history&quot; while teaching &quot;excellent life lessons&quot;. Ranking it second, &quot;Her Campus&quot; hailed the scene as &quot;the best teenage makeover ever&quot;. Total Beauty ranked the montage ninth, dubbing it the &quot;Best Hair Movie Makeover&quot;.

&quot;Bustle&quot; writer Veronica Walsingham believes &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;&#x27; makeover sequence distinguishes itself from similar scenes because Mia undergoes a complete physical transformation, avoiding the trope of simply removing her glasses.&quot; The Ringer&quot; placed the scene seventh on its &quot;definitive&quot; movie makeover ranking. The sequence&#x27;s popularity has resulted in makeover films becoming something of a trademark genre for Hathaway, whose characters have undergone similar transformations in &quot;Ella Enchanted&quot; (2004), &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; (2006), and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2012). Some media publications crowned Hathaway the &quot;queen of makeover movies&quot;. In her AllMovie biography of Hathaway, Rebecca Flint Marx said the actress &quot;became a familiar face to millions of moviegoers&quot; by proving her comedic timing in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, in turn opening &quot;a number of doors&quot; for herself as a leading lady. Hathaway initially suffered from being typecast in &quot;good girl&quot; roles after the film&#x27;s success, which inspired her to pursue a variety of more serious, non-princess roles in subsequent years. In 2018, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; ranked &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; Hathaway&#x27;s second best film performance. The website NewNowNext credits &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; with beginning to establish Hathaway as a gay icon, comparing her debut as a &quot;reluctant princess&quot; to that of actress Audrey Hepburn in &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953). The film is credited with reviving Andrews&#x27;s film career and introducing her to a younger generation of fans, rivaling her career-defining performances in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965) in terms of popularity. The film&#x27;s popularity is also credited with evolving Cabot from an author into a celebrity. Cabot remarked that the novels had actually been intended for slightly older readers, but parents who saw the G-rated film would purchase the books for their 6-7-year-old children, unintentionally exposing them to teen content.

&quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is the work for which Marshall is best remembered among millennials. When Marshall died in July 2016, several cast members paid tribute to the late director online. Following Marshall&#x27;s death, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; film critic Robbie Collin wrote that &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; is &quot;by no means a flawless movie&quot;, but rather &quot;one from which a star was able to bounce out, eyes bright, teeth flashing and primed for adoration. Marshall’s films may never have made him a critical darling, but his best work thrived on smile power – on both the faces of his audience and cast.&quot; When the film was released on Netflix in 2018, the streaming service tweeted their surprise at the revelation that Houston served as a producer on the film, inspiring several Twitter users to comment the same. The film&#x27;s popularity among audiences has since defied expectations initially indicated by its lukewarm reception nearly two decades after its release. Observing that the film experienced a renaissance in 2018, Walsingham credits the film&#x27;s resurgence to its release on Netflix and American actress Meghan Markle&#x27;s marriage to Prince Harry, whose narrative has been compared to Mia&#x27;s role in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; in the media, particularly the fact that Markle underwent &quot;duchess training&quot; for the title.

<text>Robert Woodhouse (28 April 177323 December 1827) was a British mathematician and astronomer.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Robert Woodhouse was born on 28 April 1773 in Norwich, Norfolk, the son of Robert Woodhouse, linen draper, and Judith Alderson, the daughter of a Unitarian minister from Lowestoft. Robert junior was baptised at St George&#x27;s Church, Colegate, Norwich, on 19 May, 1773. A younger son, John Thomas Woodhouse, was born in 1780. The brothers were educated at the Paston School in North Walsham, north of Norwich.

In May 1790 Woodhouse was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, the college where Paston pupils were traditionally sent. In 1795 he graduated as the Senior Wrangler (ranked first among the mathematics undergraduates at the university), and took the First Smith&#x27;s Prize. He obtained his Master&#x27;s degree at Cambridge in 1798.

===Marriage and career at Cambridge===
Woodhouse was a fellow of the college from 1798 to 1823, after which he resigned so as to be able to marry Harriet, the daughter of William Wilkin, a Norwich architect. They were married on 20 February 1823; the marriage produced a son, also named Robert. Harriet Woodhouse died at Cambridge on 31 March 1826.

Woodhouse was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 16 December 1802. His earliest work, entitled the &quot;Principles of Analytical Calculation&quot;, was published at Cambridge in 1803. In this he explained the differential notation and strongly pressed the employment of it; but he severely criticised the methods used by continental writers, and their constant assumption of non-evident principles.

In 1809 Woodhouse published a textbook covering planar trigonometry and spherical trigonometry and the next year a historical treatise on the calculus of variations and isoperimetrical problems. He next produced an astronomy; of which the first book (usually bound in two volumes), on practical and descriptive astronomy, was issued in 1812, and the second book, containing an account of the treatment of physical astronomy by Pierre-Simon Laplace and other continental writers, was issued in 1818.

Woodhouse became the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1820, but the small income caused him to resign the professorship in 1822 and instead accept the better paid post as the Plumian professor in the university. As Plumian Professor he was responsible for installing and adjusting the transit instruments and clocks at the Cambridge Observatory.

Woodhouse did not exercise much influence on the majority of his contemporaries, and the movement might have died away for the time being if it had not been for the advocacy of George Peacock, Charles Babbage, and John Herschel, who formed the Analytical Society, with the object of advocating the general use in the university of analytical methods and of the differential notation. Woodhouse was the first director of the newly built observatory at Cambridge, a post he held until his death in 1827.

On his death in Cambridge he was buried in Caius College chapel.

<text>is a Japanese hard science fiction manga written and illustrated by Makoto Yukimura. It was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Morning&quot; between January 1999 to January 2004, with its chapters collected into four volumes. It was adapted into a 26-episode anime television series by Sunrise, which was broadcast on NHK from October 2003 through April 2004. The story revolves around the crew of a space debris collection craft in the year 2075.

The manga was published in English in North America by Tokyopop, and the anime was distributed in North America by Bandai Entertainment. Both the manga and anime received the Seiun Award for best science fiction series.

== Plot ==
The story of &quot;Planetes&quot; follows the crew of the &quot;DS-12 &quot;Toy Box&quot;&quot; of the Space Debris Section, a unit of Technora Corporation. Debris Section&#x27;s purpose is to prevent the damage or destruction of satellites, space stations and spacecraft from collision with space debris in Earth&#x27;s and the Moon&#x27;s orbits. They use a number of methods to dispose of the debris (mainly by burning it via atmospheric reentry or through salvage), accomplished through the use of EVA suits. On a routine debris collection run, Yuri Mihairokov finds a compass, the only keepsake of his deceased wife, and is rescued by Hachirota &quot;Hachimaki&quot; Hoshino. Pilot Fee Carmichael stops the terrorist plan by ramming the &quot;Toy Box&quot; into the satellite and knocking it off course, sacrificing the &quot;Toy Box&quot; in the process. Hachimaki, Yuri, and Fee return to Earth, where Yuri stays with Hachimaki&#x27;s family. On their return, Hachmaki is diagnosed with Deep Space Disorder, a mental disorder that can cripple an EVA astronaut. Yuri and Fee take Hachimaki to a space engine manufacturing facility and show him the Tandem Mirror Engine, which will be installed in the &quot;Von Braun&quot; for the Jupiter Exploration Mission. Seeing this, Hachimaki resolves to join the Mission and gets over his Deep Space Disorder.

Werner Locksmith finds Hachimaki while looking for Hachimaki&#x27;s father, Goro Hoshino, to recruit him as the captain of the &quot;Von Braun&quot;. Fresh recruit Ai Tanabe is added to the crew of the &quot;Toy Box 2&quot; as a replacement for Hachimaki when he leaves to become a Jupiter Mission candidate. At the trials for the Jupiter Exploration Mission, Hachimaki learns his friend Hakim Ashmead is a terrorist bombing of an elevator. Hachimaki subdues Hakim, but is stopped from killing him by Tanabe. After being accepted in the Jupiter Exploration Mission, Hachimaki and his co-pilot Leonov crash on to the Moon&#x27;s surface. Leonov is badly injured in the crash, and Hachimaki tries to carry him to safety before being rescued by &quot;Toy Box 2&quot;. 

Tanabe runs experiments with several animals on behalf of a university, as well as another ship&#x27;s pet cat, on the &quot;Toy Box 2&quot;. Alarmed by his new stoicism, crewmate Sally offers herself to him, but Hachimaki realizes he desires Tanabe instead. He proposes to her to which she accepts. Tanabe meets and befriends The Baron, a fellow debris hauler who claims he is an alien from the planet Retikle on a mission to make a hundred friends on Earth. Werner Locksmith visits the grave of his associate killed in the Tandem Mirror Engine explosion, where the associate&#x27;s sister threatens to kill him. After returning from a holiday on Earth, Fee and the crew of &quot;Toy Box 2&quot; find a piece of classified debris, a United States Navy orbital mine. With a space war looming, Fee leads an anti-war movement to prevent Kessler Syndrome and becomes a media sensation when Colonel Sanders uses her as a hero of the anti-war movement, without her consent.

Fee recounts her experience with her uncle in the American South, particularly the racism that he encountered as an unemployed, reclusive black man living in the woods. The crew of &quot;Toy Box 2&quot; are returned to Earth, where Fee goes home to her family and attempts to resume her life as a mother. She crashes her motorcycle while avoiding a dog, but she befriends the dog and drags her motorcycle back home. The captain of &quot;Von Braun&quot; struggles with the speech he will give when the ship reaches Jupiter, resulting in him being hospitalized with a stomach ulcer. Hachimaki makes his speech when &quot;Von Braun&quot; arrives at Jupiter, concluding that he is perfectly satisfied with what he already has, and giving up on his dream of owning his own spaceship.

After working as an assistant for Shin Morimura, Makoto Yukimura started his manga. According to manga author Makoto Yukimura, the conception of &quot;Planetes&quot; was simple. One day in a library, he came across a scientific book that talked about the remains of spacecraft and satellites that were in Earth orbit. Yukimura found it interesting to know that these debris were dangerous for us, and that, at some point in life, he meant, a few years from now, these debris would be seriously disturbing the progress of the planet. Upon finishing the book, Yukimura decided to write a manga about this concept. There were no major influences other than Arthur C. Clarke. While their works are not the same, he was moved by the dilemmas of his theories. He then researched Japanese writers and was moved by Kōshū Tani. &quot;Planetes&quot; could have dozens of volumes, if he were to count the work carried out daily by space garbage collectors. However, his only goal was to show the characters&#x27; daily lives in a futuristic setting. He liked to tell the whole story with a beginning, middle, and end, and when he saw that it already had enough content, he finished it, regardless of how many volumes there are.

Concepts like momentum in weightlessness are early plot points and are always illustrated naturally. Director Goro Taniguchi stated in the DVD commentary that he learned much about orbital mechanics in the course of making the series. This can be shown in showing specific orbital energy, through changing orbits by applying thrust throughout the series. Even the necessity for the retrieval of space debris that is central to the plot is rooted in the serious and growing problem with space debris today. The Japanese space agency JAXA served as a technical consultant to the series. The US version of the DVDs featured interviews with two scientists from NASA&#x27;s Orbital Debris Section. However, both scientists stated that the premise of having to rendezvous with debris in orbit is highly unlikely as it would take an extravagant amount of energy for a relatively small amount of salvageable material. One of the scientists stated that the previous director of the NASA Orbital Debris Section was in fact Donald J. Kessler, the scientist who proposed the Kessler Syndrome, which is cited and used several times in both the anime and manga. The final settlement of the conflict is also unique in that it is not resolved by any of the main protagonists or antagonists, but by a compromise struck between powers above their heads.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===
Written and illustrated by Makoto Yukimura, the twenty-six chapters appeared as a serial in the Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Morning&quot; from January 1999 to January 2004. Kodansha collected the chapters into four volumes, and published them from January 23, 2001, to February 23, 2004. It was licensed for an English-language translation in North America by Tokyopop. It published the series in five volumes by splitting the last volume in two parts from October 7, 2003, to February 8, 2005. The translation was rereleased in two omnibus volumes by Dark Horse Comics on December 22, 2015, and May 10, 2016.

==== Volumes ====



=== Anime ===

A 26-episode anime television series adaptation aired on NHK BS-2 from October 4, 2003, to February 23, 2004. Produced and animated by Sunrise, it was directed by Gorō Taniguchi and scripted by Ichirō Ōkouchi. The anime began development and production before the end of the manga serialization. In the beginning and middle of the series, the writing and production staff only had the first three volumes of the manga as source. To fill the entire 26-episode run of the anime, new characters, new settings and new relationships between characters were made to increase dramatic tension, reinforce themes introduced in the manga, and introduce new themes that were compatible with the manga. While the manga deals more with existential themes, and humanity&#x27;s relationship with space, the anime further expands the political elements of the story.

The music score was composed by Kōtarō Nakagawa and produced by Victor Entertainment. The opening theme is &quot;Dive in the Sky&quot; by Mikio Sakai, and the ending themes are &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; by Mikio Sakai for episodes 1–25 and &quot;Planetes&quot; by Hitomi Kuroishi for episode 26. There are two insert songs, &quot;A Secret of the Moon&quot; by Hitomi Kuroishi, used in various episodes, and &quot;Thanks My Friend&quot; by Mikio Sakai used in episode 13.

Crunchyroll added the series to its streaming platform on October 15, 2024, and it is set to be released on a Blu-ray Disc set on November 5 of the same year.

== Reception ==
Both the manga and the anime were critically acclaimed. According to &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, the manga has a &quot;solid, engrossing storyline and well-developed characters&quot;. Anime News Network also proclaimed &quot;Planetes&quot; to be the best science fiction anime series of 2005. Both the manga and anime received the Seiun Award for best science fiction series, the manga in 2002 and the anime in 2005. The manga was nominated for a Angoulême International Comics Festival award in the Raja Eco-Fauve Selection category in 2023.

Pop Matters described &quot;Planetes&quot; as one of the best sci-fi manga due to the setting chosen and how Yukimura executes the characterization of the main characters. Mania Entertainment initially praised the handling of Hachimaki and Tanabe who possessed their own unique dreams and traits in the manga despite working together and enjoyed Yukimura&#x27;s artwork, standing not only for the character designs but also backgrounds. In a following review, &quot;Otaku USA&quot; liked the artwork for the detailed character designs, most notably their expressions and also recommended the manga due to its focus on human relationships. &quot;Comics Worth Reading&quot; recommended the manga, praising the execution of the several themes the characters deal with such as space isolation or conflicts with terrorists which helps to develop Hachimaki and his relationship with the supporting characters. Animefringe noted that despite &quot;Planetes&quot; being a &quot;seinen manga&quot;, the manga is still accessible for young readers due to lack of overthetop violence and nudity being kept to the minimum. For the climax, Mania enjoyed the new conflicts Hachimaki&#x27;s career faced and how he still fought to decide what to do with his life alongside Tanabe. The Techora side of the story also met similar response by Mania.

The anime was praised by Mania for the focus on Hachimaki and Tanabe&#x27;s relationship as the apparent love triangle with the young Nono helped to expand more on the knowledge about Lunarians&#x27; growth and how her condition was not treated as a disadvantage as Nono enjoys living in the Moon.

In terms of sales, the manga was only a modest success in North America, with volume 3 reaching 81st place on the Diamond US sales top 100, selling about 1100 copies through the distributor. Volume 4 reached 93rd place, selling about 1400 copies.
