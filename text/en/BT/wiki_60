<text>The Second Happy Time (; officially Operation Paukenschlag (&quot;Operation Drumbeat&quot;), and also known among German submarine commanders as the &quot;American Shooting Season&quot;) was a phase in the Battle of the Atlantic during which Axis submarines attacked merchant shipping and Allied naval vessels along the east coast of North America. The First Happy Time was in 1940–41 in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and as a result their navies could begin the Second Happy Time.

The Second Happy Time lasted from January 1942 to about August of that year and involved several German naval operations, including Operation Neuland. German submariners named it the &quot;Happy Time&quot; or the &quot;Golden Time,&quot; as defense measures were weak and disorganized, and the U-boats were able to inflict massive damage with little risk. During this period, Axis submarines sank 609 ships totaling 3.1 million tons, against a loss of only 22 U-boats. This led to the loss of thousands of lives, mainly those of merchant mariners. Although fewer than the losses during the 1917 campaign of the First World War, those of this period equaled roughly one quarter of all ships sunk by U-boats during the entire Second World War.

Historian Michael Gannon called it &quot;America&#x27;s Second Pearl Harbor&quot; and placed the blame for the nation&#x27;s failure to respond quickly to the attacks on the inaction of Admiral Ernest J. King, commander-in-chief of the United States Navy (USN). As King also refused British offers to provide the US navy with their own ships, the belated institution of a convoy system was in large part due to a severe shortage of suitable escort vessels, without which convoys were seen as actually more vulnerable than lone ships.

==Background==
===German intentions===
Upon Germany&#x27;s declaration of war on the United States on 11 December 1941 just after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US was, on paper at least, in a fortunate position. Where the other combatants on the Allied side had already lost thousands of trained sailors and airmen, and were experiencing shortages of ships and aircraft, the US was at full strength (save for its recent losses at Pearl Harbor). The US had the opportunity to learn about modern naval warfare by observing the conflicts in the North Sea and the Mediterranean, and through a close relationship with the United Kingdom. The USN had already gained significant experience in countering U-boats in the Atlantic, particularly from April 1941 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt extended the &quot;Pan-American Security Zone&quot; east almost as far as Iceland. The United States had massive manufacturing capacity and a favorable geographical position from a defensive point of view: the port of New York, for example, was 3,000 miles to the west of the U-boat bases in Brittany.

U-boat commander &quot;Vizeadmiral&quot; Karl Dönitz saw the entry of the US into the war as a golden opportunity to strike heavy blows in the tonnage war and Hitler ordered an assault on America on 12 December 1941. The standard Type VII submarine had insufficient range to patrol off the coast of North America (although, in due time, Type VII submarines were successfully able to patrol off the eastern seaboard of North America, due to refueling, rearming, and resupply logistical support by Type XIV submarine tender); the only suitable weapons he had on hand were the larger Type IX. These were less maneuverable and slower to submerge, making them much more vulnerable than the Type VIIs. They were also fewer in number.

===American deficiencies===

The American response in early 1942 was hampered by poor organization and doctrine, and a lack of anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft, ships, and personnel.

The USN entered the war without the equivalent of the British sloop or the despite previous involvement in the Atlantic (see .) The massive new naval construction program prioritized other types of ships. Fleet destroyers did not have the qualities for ASW; the ideal ASW escort had relatively low speed; carried a large number of depth charges; was highly maneuverable; and had long endurance. The 50 World War I-era destroyers transferred to Britain in the 1941 Destroyers for Bases Agreement would have been poor ASW escorts, even had they been retained, due to poor maneuverability.

The USN had some destroyers available on the east coast at the time of the first attacks. It had previously recalled at least 25 Atlantic Convoy Escort Command Destroyers, including seven at anchor in New York Harbor. It initially refused to use them as escorts even as losses mounted. When the first destroyers were finally released, their employment was hampered by poor doctrine. They were assigned to offensive patrols rather than escorting convoys due to public and political pressure. As late as March, USN escort doctrine was aggressive with an emphasis on destroying attackers, rather than stopping losses. The option of pressing small civilian ships into service as rudimentary convoy escorts in early 1942 was not exercised.

Even if escorts had been available, the USN was unprepared to perform &quot;Naval Control of Shipping&quot; (NCS), the control and tracking of shipping (in convoy or sailing independently), although it had already received the reference material from Canada. Without escorts, the US could not take advantage of the existing Allied NCS. For shipping in the western Atlantic north of the equator, NCS was handled by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) since the start of the war; the RCN only passed the responsibility to the USN in July 1942.

Operationally, the USN&#x27;s ASW effort was fragmented. In theory, Admiral King was responsible for coordinating all ASW activities, including the development of doctrine. In practice, King&#x27;s many other responsibilities prevented him from doing an adequate job. Therefore, the three Atlantic operational commands – the Atlantic Fleet, the Eastern Sea Frontier, and the Gulf Sea Frontier – were left to develop their own ASW tactics individually. The issue was not resolved until May 1943 with the formation of the United States Tenth Fleet.

British experience in the first two years of World War II, which included the massive losses incurred to their shipping during the First Happy Time confirmed that ships sailing in convoy – with or without escort – were far safer than ships sailing alone. The British recommended that merchant ships should avoid obvious standard routings wherever possible; navigational markers, lighthouses, and other aids to the enemy should be removed, and a strict coastal blackout be enforced. In addition, any available air and sea forces should perform daylight patrols to restrict the U-boats&#x27; flexibility. For several months, none of the recommendations were followed. Coastal shipping continued to sail along marked routes and burn normal navigation lights. Boardwalk communities ashore were only &#x27;requested&#x27; to &#x27;consider&#x27; turning their illuminations off on 18 December 1941, but not in the cities; they did not want to offend the tourism, recreation and business sectors. 

The primary target area was the Eastern Sea Frontier, commanded by Rear-Admiral Adolphus Andrews and covering the area from Maine to North Carolina. Andrews had practically no modern forces to work with: on the water he commanded seven Coast Guard cutters, four converted yachts, three 1919-vintage patrol boats, two gunboats dating back to 1905, and four wooden submarine chasers. About 100 aircraft were available, but these were short-range models only suitable for training. As a consequence of the traditionally antagonistic relationship between the USN and the Army Air Forces, all larger aircraft remained under USAAF control, and in any case the USAAF was neither trained nor equipped for ASW.

== Campaign ==
=== Opening moves ===
Immediately after war was declared on the United States, Dönitz began to implement Operation Paukenschlag (often translated as &quot;drumbeat&quot; or &quot;drumroll&quot;, and literally as &quot;timpani beat&quot;). Only six of the twenty operational Type IX boats were available, and one of those six encountered mechanical trouble. This left just five long-range submarines for the opening moves of the campaign.

Loaded with the maximum possible amounts of fuel, food and ammunition, the first of the five Type IXs left Lorient in France on 18 December 1941, the others following over the next few days. Each carried sealed orders to be opened after passing 20°W, which directed them to different parts of the North American coast. No charts or sailing directions were available: &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Reinhard Hardegen of , for example, was provided with two tourist guides to New York, one of which contained a fold-out map of the harbor.

Each U-boat made routine signals on exiting the Bay of Biscay, which were picked up by the British Y service and plotted in Rodger Winn&#x27;s London Submarine Tracking Room, which were then able to follow the progress of the Type IXs across the Atlantic, and cable an early warning to the RCN. Working on the slimmest of evidence, Winn correctly deduced the target area and passed a detailed warning to Admiral King, of a &quot;heavy concentration of U-boats off the North American seaboard&quot;, including the five boats already on station and further groups that were in transit, 21 U-boats in all. Rear-Admiral Edwin T. Layton of the US Combined Operations and Intelligence Center then informed the responsible area commanders, but little or nothing else was done.

On 12 January 1942, Admiral Andrews was warned that &quot;three or four U-boats&quot; were about to commence operations against coastal shipping (in fact, there were indeed three), but he refused to institute a convoy system on the grounds that this would only provide the U-boats with more targets.

When sank the 9,500-ton Norwegian tanker &quot;Norness&quot; within sight of Long Island in the early hours of 14 January, no warships were dispatched to investigate, allowing the &quot;U-123&quot; to sink the 6,700-ton British tanker &quot;Coimbra&quot; off Sandy Hook on the following night before proceeding south towards New Jersey. By this time there were 13 destroyers idle in New York Harbor, yet none were employed to deal with the immediate threat, and over the following nights &quot;U-123&quot; was presented with a succession of easy targets, most of them burning navigation lamps. At times, &quot;U-123&quot; was operating in coastal waters that were so shallow that they barely allowed it to conceal itself, let alone evade a depth charge attack.

=== Operation Drumbeat ===
The first attack wave, Operation Drumbeat, consisted of five Type IX boats. Their first victory upon arriving in the coastal region of North America was the Canadian freighter &quot;Cyclops&quot;, sunk on 12 January off Nova Scotia. According to Robert Fisher, 26 more ships were sunk in the following nine days. The boats cruised along the coast, safely submerged through the day, and surfacing at night to pick off merchant vessels outlined against the lights of the cities.
* Reinhard Hardegen in sank seven ships totalling 46,744 tons before he ran out of torpedoes and returned to base;
* Ernst Kals in sank six ships of 36,988 tons;
* Robert-Richard Zapp in sank five ships of 33,456 tons;
* Heinrich Bleichrodt in sank four ships of 27,651 tons; and
* Ulrich Folkers on his first patrol in sank one 6,666-ton vessel, the &quot;West Ivis&quot; (he was criticized by Dönitz for his poor performance, although he would later win the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross).

When the first wave of U-boats returned to port through the early part of February, Dönitz wrote that each commander &quot;had such an abundance of opportunities for attack that he could not by any means utilize them all: there were times when there were up to ten ships in sight, sailing with all lights burning on peacetime courses.&quot;

The RCN immediately organized coastal convoys when Drumbeat began despite the difficulty in finding escorts. 37 ships were lost in January and February, and only 11 in March and April. The RCN noted that by March and April the U-boats preferred hunting in US waters.

===U-boats in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico===

The second wave of Type IX boats had arrived in North American waters, and the third wave (Operation Neuland) had reached its patrol area off the oil ports of the Caribbean. With such easy pickings and all Type IX boats already committed, Dönitz began sending shorter-range Type VIIs to the US East Coast as well. This required extraordinary measures: cramming every conceivable space with provisions, some even filling the fresh water tanks with diesel oil, and crossing the Atlantic at very low speed on a single engine to conserve fuel.

In the United States there was still no concerted response to the attacks. Responsibility rested with Admiral King, but he was preoccupied with the Japanese onslaught in the Pacific. Admiral Andrews&#x27; North Atlantic Coastal Frontier was expanded to take in South Carolina and renamed the Eastern Sea Frontier (ESF), but most of the ships and aircraft needed remained under the command of Admiral Royal E. Ingersoll, Commander-in-Chief, Atlantic Fleet, who was often at sea and unavailable to make decisions. Rodger Winn&#x27;s detailed weekly U-boat situation reports from the Submarine Tracking Room in London were available but ignored. By April, Allied forces along the US east coast included 80 small patrol ships in the USN Eastern Sea Frontier, 160 US aircraft, 24 RN ASW trawlers, and one British Coastal Command squadron. By British and Canadian standards these were enough to begin convoying, but no comprehensive convoy system was implemented that month. Instead, on 1 April the US implemented a partial convoy system where convoys moved along the coast in short hops, moving during daytime and stopping in protected anchorages during nights; these were slow and ineffective.

Coastal forces were reinforced from the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) before March. The US contribution to the MOEF fell to part of one group. Five RCN corvettes were withdrawn to escort the new Boston-Halifax convoys, the first convoys along the American seaboard. In April, a Royal Navy (RN) group redeployed to the Caribbean to defend tankers. The RCN attempted to reinforce the MOEF by using training ships in supporting roles.

Allied tanker losses were alarming. Losses along the North American coast and in the Caribbean accounted for most of the 73 American tankers lost in the first half of 1942, and 22 British tankers lost in March; three out of the four largest Canadian tankers were also lost from February to May. In March, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill urged the USN to organize coastal convoys, to little effect. The next month, British tankers from the Caribbean avoided the US coast and sailed east to Freetown in Africa, while between 16 and 29 April the US ordered US and Caribbean coastal waters closed to commercial tanker movement. On 26 April, the US agreed to allow Britain to redeploy a MOEF group to establish Caribbean convoys, but the US refused to start its own Caribbean convoys or to provide escorts.

Eastern Canada was dependent on imported oil from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The crisis led to gasoline rationing on 1 April, and the potential consequences of the US-ordered halt to tanker movements were severe. On 28 April, the RCN started ad hoc convoys to bring Canadian and Canadian-charted tankers trapped in the US and the Caribbean back to Halifax. On 1 May, the Government of Canada insisted that Canadian tankers be escorted, leading the RCN to organize formal convoys to the Caribbean through US coastal waters. The RCN had only enough escorts to run convoys from Halifax to Trinidad (coded as TH); the loss of supply from other regional suppliers had to be accepted. In July, Trinidad was replaced by Aruba to accommodate British tanker movement. From May to August, fourteen convoys – including 76 tankers and 4 million barrels of oil – were run without a single ship lost. The convoys were discontinued in August with the advent of the US&#x27;s comprehensive convoying system. Canada also began convoys between Nova Scotia and Quebec City in May.

The search for Allied tankers and the support of , a Type XIV, pushed the U-boat offensive into the Gulf of Mexico. On 21 April, &quot;U-459&quot; was 600 miles north-west of Bermuda; it refuelled fourteen U-boats through 6 May, including Type VIIs, headed for the Gulf and the Caribbean. In May, they sank 115 ships (of which 101 were steaming independently), about half being in the Gulf, with half of that tonnage being tankers. In June, they sank 122 ships, of which 108 were sailing independently. The Gulf Sea Frontier, formed in early February, had barely any resources and was ineffective.

=== US convoys arrive ===
The first organized US coastal convoy sailed on 14 May 1942 from Hampton Roads for Key West; convoys eventually extended to Halifax. The US sought another 15 to 20 corvettes from Britain. By this time, two British escort groups were already in the Caribbean and the MOEF was under strain. Nonetheless, Britain and Canada responded to US requests by reducing the size of the remaining MOEF groups. The MOEF and the RCN had no further slack. The RCN struggled to meet its commitments even with 90% of its escort fleet being operational, as opposed to being used for training or being refitted; the negative effects of this over-extension would be felt well into 1943. By comparison the RN escort fleet was merely two-thirds operational. The weakening of MOEF contributed to difficulties in the mid-Atlantic in August.

The US convoy system effectively brought the crisis to an end. By early-July most U-boats only operated along the perimeter of the Caribbean. German attention returned to the mid-Atlantic.

== Propaganda ==
Popular alarm at the sinkings was dealt with by a combination of secrecy and misleading propaganda. The US Navy confidently announced that many of the U-boats would &quot;never enjoy the return portion of their voyage&quot; but that unfortunately, details of the sunken U-boats could not be made public lest the information aid the enemy. All citizens who had witnessed the sinking of a U-boat were asked to help keep the secrets safe.

<doc id="575594" wikidata="Q2164820" url="?curid=575594" title="Milk chocolate">
<text>Milk chocolate is a form of solid chocolate containing cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate, and is used in a wide diversity of bars, tablets and other confectionery products. Milk chocolate contains smaller amounts of cocoa solids than dark chocolates do, and (as with white chocolate) contains milk solids. While its taste (akin to chocolate milk) has been key to its popularity, milk chocolate was historically promoted as a healthy food, particularly for children.

Major milk chocolate producers include Ferrero, Hershey, Mondelez, Mars and Nestlé; collectively these supply over half of the world&#x27;s chocolate. Four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, and increasing amounts are consumed in both China and Latin America.

Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in pre-Columbian times, and upon its introduction to Western Europe. The word &quot;chocolate&quot; arrived in the English language about 1600, but initially described dark chocolate. The first use of the term &quot;milk chocolate&quot; was for a beverage brought to London from Jamaica in 1687, but it was not until the Swiss inventor Daniel Peter successfully combined cocoa and condensed milk in 1875 that the milk chocolate bar was invented. Switzerland developed as the centre of milk chocolate production, particularly after the development of the conche by Rodolphe Lindt, and was increasingly exporting to an international market. Milk chocolate became mainstream at the beginning of the twentieth century following the launch of Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk and the Hershey bar, inducing a dramatic increase in world cocoa consumption.

To provide ethical assurances on cocoa harvesting for consumers, Fair Trade and UTZ Certified chocolate was established in the 21st century.

==History==

The word &quot;chocolate&quot; was first used in English in 1604. The first instance of &quot;milk chocolate&quot; appeared soon after, referring to a drink of chocolate combined with milk. In 1687, Hans Sloane, an Irish physician and collector, introduced the beverage to London after seeing the people of Jamaica enjoying the drink. The preparation was promoted for its medicinal properties, and was manufactured by Nicholas Sanders and William White, and was joined by other milk chocolates around the city. From there, milk chocolate spread, first to France, where the pharmacist to Louis XVI, Sulpice Debauve, introduced the drink to the Court, and then further afield, reaching as far as the United States by 1834. 

Early attempts to make eating milk chocolate were foiled by the substantial water content of milk which did not willingly mix with cocoa butter (a fat); efforts at combining the two produced chocolates that were an &quot;oily and milky mess&quot;. In Dresden in the German Confederation, Jordan &amp; Timaeus were developing a mechanism to produce hard chocolate using steam power. On 23 May 1839, they advertised a solid chocolate containing fresh milk, calling it &quot;steam chocolate&quot; (). However, that version of milk chocolate did not become successful and when major companies like Fry&#x27;s of Bristol and Lindt of Zürich started producing eating chocolate in the 1840s, they only made plain chocolate.
In 1875, the Swiss entrepreneur and chocolatier Daniel Peter, based in Vevey and related to the Cailler family, first successfully combined cocoa mass, cocoa butter, and sugar with condensed milk (recently created by his neighbour and friend Henri Nestlé) to produce solidified milk chocolate. However, this was not meant to be eaten, but it was meant to be used for chocolate milk drinks; milk chocolate as we know it today was only created a decade later. In 1887, the first eating milk chocolate brand, Gala Peter, was finally launched. Daniel Peter called his product &#x27;Gala&#x27; after the Greek word meaning &#x27;milk&#x27;. Milk chocolate also benefited from another recent Swiss invention, Rodolphe Lindt&#x27;s conche, which allowed the creation of a smoother chocolate.

Not only did milk soften the bitterness of chocolate and refined its taste, but it also lowered its production cost due to a lower cocoa content. As a consequence, Peter&#x27;s recipe leaked to other nearby manufacturers: Cailler and Kohler. In 1898, Cailler opened its new factory at Broc, where milk chocolate began to be produced on a large scale. Peter also opened a larger factory at Orbe in 1901, before merging with Kohler. The same year, Suchard of Neuchâtel launched the Milka brand; Carl Russ-Suchard had previously developed a first milk bar in 1896. The Swiss chocolate industry also expanded in the late nineteenth century with the establishment of new companies, such as Frey and Tobler. From these developments, Switzerland soon dominated the chocolate market. Production increased dramatically, and by 1905, the country was producing of chocolate, a vast proportion of it exported.
Meanwhile, there were other developments outside Switzerland. Swiss dominance was challenged in 1905 by a product from England, Cadbury Dairy Milk. Although there had been other milk chocolates produced outside Switzerland before – Cadbury themselves had produced one in 1897 – they suffered from low sales. In contrast, Dairy Milk quickly rose in prominence and, by the 1920s, was the bestselling chocolate in the UK. Simultaneously, in 1900, Milton Hershey had introduced the first Hershey bar, which revolutionised the popularity of milk chocolate in the United States. Although initially only available in Pennsylvania, by 1906 it was sold across the country. Popularity blossomed, particularly following World War I, when the United States Army issued chocolate bars to troops, for many their first taste of milk chocolate. By 1911, Peter&#x27;s milk chocolate recipe represented half of the world&#x27;s chocolate consumption. Milk chocolate became the standard of what the public thought chocolate should be.

As a result of the increasing popularity of chocolate, especially among the working and middle-class, cocoa consumption began to grow extraordinarily; global demand grew 800 percent between 1880 and 1900. To meet these demands, cocoa production expanded, notably in West Africa, where the Forastero variety began to be mass cultivated in the early twentieth century. Although considered inferior to the Criollo variety, the Forastero type bean is more suited for the manufacture of milk chocolate and is cheaper to produce owing to its higher yields. Countries in West Africa eventually dominated world production of cocoa. Conversely, milk became the critical ingredient. Contrary to cocoa and sugar, milk spoils quickly, therefore it cannot be stored for long periods of time. This favored the implantation of large factories (as well as new populations of workers) in the countryside, where abundant fresh milk supplies are readily available. The Cailler factory of Broc and the Hershey factory of Derry Township are typical examples. The popularity of milk chocolate and the wide availability of milk also favoured the creation in the 1930s of a new variety of chocolate containing even more milk: white chocolate.
Over the decades, milk chocolate manufacture spread worldwide and new brands appeared. In 1910, Arthur and George Ensor created the first milk chocolate in Canada, using milk from Jersey cows. At the same time, Belgian chocolate production also expanded rapidly. From small beginnings in the 1870s, by the 1920s, there were ninety chocolate manufacturers around Brussels alone. In 1926, Meiji brought out their bar, the first example to be made in Japan. Milk chocolate swiftly dominated chocolate sales in most markets. It even found a place during World War II, when US troops carried D Ration chocolate, nicknamed Logan Bars after Quartermaster Paul Logan, as an emergency supply. At the same time, new ways of presenting chocolate appeared, from different shapes, like Cadbury Buttons, to the profusion of boxed varieties that became a feature of Belgian chocolate.

At the same time, the number of independent manufacturers declined sharply. The first consolidations in the industry were in Switzerland, where the takeover of Lindt by Sprüngli took place in 1899, and Nestlé had already emerged as the largest manufacture in the country by 1929. However, pace quickened in the latter half of the century. During the last three decades of the twentieth century, there were over 200 takeovers in the industry. By 2001, over half the global chocolate market was held by 17 companies. By 2013, the top four manufacturers, Mondelez, Mars, Nestlé and Ferrero, comprised 49 percent of the sales. This has continued; for example, in 2015, Thorntons, the British chocolatier that in four years before had produced the largest chocolate bar in the world weighing , was taken over by Ferrero.

In 2018, the global market for milk chocolate was worth $63.2 billion, and is expected to approach $73 billion by 2024. Consumption is dominated by the United States and Europe, which between them consumed over 80 percent of global production. However, the new century saw expansion in different markets. For example, between 2000 and 2013, the areas that saw the highest growth included the Middle East and Africa (where retail value rose 239 percent), Latin America (up 228 percent). Even in China and Japan, which traditionally are places of very low milk consumption, milk chocolate sales increased at the start of the twenty-first century. Between 1999 and 2003, Chinese chocolate imports rose from $17.7 million to $50 million. By 2007, over 38 percent of chocolate sales in China were milk chocolate. By 2018, the value of sales by Japanese chocolatier Meiji was approaching that of the top producers in Europe, and the total sales by the group had surpassed the total for all confectionery sales by Hershey, putting the American company outside a top five ranking.

Although dark chocolate regained some popularity in the late twentieth century, milk chocolate remains the most preferred and consumed type of chocolate.

==Nutrition==

Milk chocolate is 51% carbohydrates, 38% fat, 8% protein, and 2% water (table). In a reference amount of , milk chocolate supplies 565 calories of food energy, and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin B12 (31% DV), riboflavin (25% DV), and dietary minerals, such as phosphorus (30% DV) (table). Milk chocolate has moderate content (10–19% DV) of thiamine and several minerals.

==Manufacturing and marketing==
While all milk chocolate contains cocoa, milk and sugar, the proportion of these ingredients varies between countries and brands, which in turn affects its taste. For example, Belgian chocolate is known for its mild milky flavor, while some Russian brands have a strong cocoa taste. Cost is the main reason for the introduction of cocoa butter replacements like coconut and palm oil. However, there are also regulatory reasons. In 1973, for example, the European Union decreed that chocolate must have a minimum of 35 percent dry cocoa solids. China has also introduced legislation to require locally produced milk chocolate to contain 25 percent cocoa butter.

Milk chocolate has been presented as a health food since Cadbury first advertised Sloane&#x27;s Milk Chocolate for its medicinal properties in the nineteenth century. In the 1920s, the Baby Ruth bar was touted as a health food for children by Allan Roy Dafoe. Advertisements pronounced that chocolate bars combined both a source of essential energy and the &quot;perfectly balanced food&quot; of milk.

Cocoa butter was claimed to reduce tooth decay. Chocolate was claimed to produce calming effects, reducing stress, and producing a similar feeling to falling in love.

===Processing===
Milk chocolate is manufactured from cocoa, milk and sugar. It is the manufacturing process, rather than the raw ingredients, which is most responsible for each brand&#x27;s flavor. 

The ingredient which defines the product as chocolate, cocoa bean, is mainly grown in Southeast Asia, South America, and West Africa, particularly the Ivory Coast, which supplies 40 percent of the total global cocoa market. Once the cocoa pods are harvested, the seeds, known as &quot;beans&quot;, are removed and fermented, then dried. They are then taken to a processing plant where they are cleaned and roasted. The beans are then ground, usually in a two-stage process, first with an impact mill to liquify the cocoa, and then a ball mill. Milk chocolate usually contains a much larger proportion of cocoa butter than the one that is naturally present in cocoa liquor; unlike dark chocolate, a large part of non-fat cocoa solids is going to be replaced by milk solids. Therefore, cocoa butter has to be produced in parallel by separating cocoa liquor into cocoa butter and cocoa powder. Milk chocolate has a minimum cacao content of 10% in the US, and has been produced with as much as 70% cacao.

At this stage, the two other key ingredients come into the process: milk and sugar. Milk ingredients are complex and critical in delivering the properties and taste to milk chocolate. Milk-origin (terroir) and associated farming have become an important marketing topic. Milk substitutes like rice milk are also used to create lactose-free milk-like chocolate. Milk is often added in powdered form, particularly in German, French, and Belgian milk chocolate, as excess water would damage the flowing properties of the liquid chocolate. Spray dried full-fat milk powder is normally used, but alternatives include anhydrous full fat or skimmed milk powders, and the choice affects the overall flavor. Condensed milk is preferred by some manufacturers, particularly where milk production is seasonal. In most of Europe, milk chocolate must contain at least 3.5% milkfat. 

Sugar, the last major ingredient, is added at the same time as the milk powder, either in a roll refiner or conche. Sugar is an international commodity, with production of sugar cane led by Brazil, India, Thailand, China and Australia. Sugar beet is also used. Sometimes the milk and sugar are mixed separately before being added to the liquid cocoa mass and cocoa butter. About 45 to 50% of most milk chocolate is sugar, by weight. 

The liquid chocolate is then poured into moulds and formed into bars or any other shape.

====Chocolate crumb====
This is the original method developed by Daniel Peter to make milk chocolate. It consists of mixing cocoa liquor with sweetened condensed milk and drying it into a powder resembling bread crumbs. The powder is then refined with the additional cocoa butter.

British milk chocolate derives its characteristic, slightly cooked flavor by using a dehydrated blend of milk, sugar, and cocoa called chocolate crumb. Originally developed because milk production was high during the summer but chocolate demand was highest during the Christmas shopping season, chocolate crumb is a hard, dry, brittle substance whose purpose is to preserve the milk. Chocolate crumb formed an alternative to plain dried milk and had the advantage, compared against full-cream milk powder (FCMP), that the milk fats were less likely to go rancid in storage. The process of making chocolate crumb usually produces a Maillard reaction, resulting in a subtle &quot;cooked&quot; flavor.

====The Hershey process====
The actual Hershey process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, and then the milk is pasteurized, stabilizing it for use. The resulting milk chocolate has been described by experts as &quot;tangy&quot;, &quot;sour&quot;, and &quot;acidified&quot;.

=== National preferences ===
Milk chocolate developed in different places, using different processes and locally available technology, and the end result is that milk chocolate produced in different countries has different characteristic flavor profiles. For example, British milk chocolate tastes slightly cooked or baked, American milk chocolate tastes more acidic, Swiss milk chocolate has a fresh milk flavor, and Belgian milk chocolate has more cocoa flavor and less milk flavor than the Swiss milk chocolate. This is primarily due to the different approaches to preparing and incorporating milk into the chocolate. 

No matter what the flavor is, consumers prefer the style that they are accustomed to and dislike less familiar flavors. Multinational chocolate producers adapt their products to the style preferred locally. When that hasn&#x27;t been done, the product generally sells poorly. For example, the Hershey process gives that brand&#x27;s milk chocolate a particular taste, which is common and expected in the US, so some rival manufacturers now add butyric acid to their milk chocolates. Cadbury&#x27;s attempted to introduce their Cadbury Dairy Milk recipe, using the chocolate crumb process, to the former East Germany, which was accustomed to the flavor profile of milk chocolate made from powdered milk, and to the US, which was accustomed to the flavor profile of milk chocolate made through the Hershey&#x27;s process, and in both cases the unfamiliar flavor proved less popular than they expected. 

==Milk chocolate combination bars==

At the beginning of the twentieth century, bars which combined milk chocolate with other sweet ingredients appeared on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1904, Cailler launched its Branche, a praline-filled and branch-looking bar. Other Swiss chocolatiers, Theodor Tobler and Emil Baumann, invented Toblerone in 1908 which contained almonds, honey and nougat. In the United States, the Goo Goo Cluster was first introduced in 1912 which added caramel, marshmallow and peanuts to the list of ingredients. These were soon followed, in 1914, by Fry&#x27;s Turkish Delight in the UK. Shortly afterwards, Clark introduced the Clark Bar, which has been called the first combination bar, in 1917. In 1920, Otto Schnering of the Curtiss Candy Company created the Baby Ruth bar. By 1925, it was the most popular bar in the US. Soon afterwards, two other brands that would become global giants followed, the Mars Bar in 1932 and, three years later, Rowntree&#x27;s introduced the Kit Kat. By 2014, 650 Kit Kat bars were being consumed each second. Combination bars came to dominate the confectionery market with sales surpassing $140 billion in 2018. As of 2023, milk chocolate was most commonly paired globally with caramel flavours and almonds.

==Ethical issues==
Ethical issues have been intrinsically linked to chocolate in general since the early days. Many of the early chocolatiers, including Cadbury, Fry&#x27;s, Rowntree&#x27;s and Terry&#x27;s, were founded by Quakers who saw the wellbeing of their workers part of their business ethic. The companies were pioneers in social welfare, providing a safe working environment, high quality housing and other benefits to employees that were ahead of many of the industrial norms. Cadbury, for example, provided paid holidays, insurance and night schools for workers, as well as constructing Bournville in Birmingham, UK. However, the working conditions of many in the wider chocolate supply chain remained poor. Slavery, and later bonded labour, was often employed on the plantations that provided the sugar used to make chocolate. Even after the abolition of slavery, the working conditions in many plantations was still poor, with child labour being frequent and unreported. In 1975, the first in a series of International Cocoa Agreements tried to set what were termed &quot;fair labour conditions&quot; and eliminate child labour.

Rising consumer awareness, as well as greater corporate and employee interest, led to increasing voluntary action to address human rights issues. Fundamental to this has been the rise of Fair Trade and UTZ Certified chocolate. Initially launched by Stichting Max Havelaar in the Netherlands in 1988, the Fair Trade movement expanded into the mainstream in the following decades, with cocoa second to coffee in terms of sales and volume by 2011. Much of this is driven by the use of Fair Trade ingredients by major brands. For example, in Germany, major supermarket Lidl commenced promoting their own brand milk chocolate with their own Fair Trade label in 2006. Similarly, in the UK, two of the best selling milk chocolate bars, Cadburys Dairy Milk and Nestlé&#x27;s Kit Kat were marketed with a Fair Trade label starting in 2009 and 2010 respectively.

<text>The State Anthem of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic was the anthem of Latvia from 1945 to 1990 when it was occupied by the Soviet Union.

The anthem was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic on 19 July 1945, subsequently banning the previous anthem &quot;Dievs, svētī Latviju!&quot;. The original lyrics had references to Joseph Stalin until its replacement in 1977, when the references of him were removed. After Latvia regained independence in 1990, &quot;Dievs, svētī Latviju!&quot; was restored as its anthem on 15 February 1991.

==Background==

The music was composed by Anatols Liepiņš, and the lyrics were written by Fricis Rokpelnis and Jūlijs Vanags.

<doc id="575600" wikidata="Q190515" url="?curid=575600" title="Craig Bellamy">
<text>Craig Douglas Bellamy (born 13 July 1979) is a Welsh football coach and former professional footballer who played as a forward. He is the current head coach of the Wales national team. 

Born in Cardiff, Bellamy made his professional debut with Norwich City in 1996. He signed for Premier League side Coventry City in 2000, breaking the club&#x27;s record transfer fee, but suffered relegation in his only season. He joined Newcastle United the following year where he helped the club achieve two top-four finishes during a four year spell. Bellamy fell out with manager Graeme Souness in 2005 and spent the latter part of the 2004–05 season on loan at Celtic, where he won the Scottish Cup. Bellamy returned to the Premier League later that year, playing one season with both Blackburn Rovers, where he was named the club&#x27;s player of the year, and Liverpool, helping the club reach the 2007 UEFA Champions League final. In 2007 he signed for West Ham United but injury disrupted his time there and in 2009 he joined Manchester City. For the 2010–11 season, Bellamy dropped a division to the Championship to represent his boyhood club Cardiff City on a season-long loan. Bellamy returned to Liverpool the following season, winning the 2011–12 League Cup and reaching the FA Cup final, before rejoining Cardiff City permanently in 2012. He later led them to the Premier League and played one more season with the club, setting a new record by scoring for his seventh different club in the division, before retiring from playing in 2014.

Having represented Wales at several youth levels, in 1998 at the age of 18, Bellamy made his senior debut for Wales against Jamaica. Over the next fifteen years, Bellamy gained 78 caps for his country and scored 19 goals. He was the captain of the side from 2007 to 2011, when he stepped down from the role due to recurring injuries. Bellamy retired from international football following the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. He was also a member of the Great Britain Olympic team at the 2012 Olympics in London, appearing five times and scoring once.

Bellamy has been involved in numerous high-profile incidents during his career with teammates, managers and members of the public and was described by Bobby Robson as &quot;a great player wrapped round an unusual and volatile character&quot;. Outside football, he has been a patron of several charities and started his own organisation, The Craig Bellamy Foundation, in Sierra Leone to provide schooling and football coaching to disadvantaged children.

==Early life==
Craig Douglas Bellamy was born on 13 July 1979 at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, the second of three boys born to Douglas and Angela Bellamy. At the time, the family lived on Swinton Street near the Splott district of the city, a traditionally working-class environment. Bellamy&#x27;s mother worked as a cleaner and his father worked at the nearby Allied Steel and Wire site that overlooked the family home, where he remained until the plant&#x27;s closure in 2002. With both his parents working full-time, Bellamy spent most of his school holidays at his paternal grandmother&#x27;s home in Adamsdown. He suffers from asthma; as a child he made frequent visits to hospital to manage the condition. At the age of five, Bellamy and his family moved to the eastern suburb Trowbridge, which is part of a council estate built in the 1960s.

Bellamy&#x27;s father was a keen football fan who supported Cardiff City and Bellamy&#x27;s first experience of professional football was watching a Football League Fourth Division match between Cardiff and Newport County at Cardiff&#x27;s home ground Ninian Park during the 1987–88 season, which Cardiff won 4–0. His father played amateur football for local Cardiff-based sides; Bellamy described him as a &quot;sluggish right-back&quot;. Bellamy&#x27;s interest in the sport grew rapidly; he regularly attended Cardiff City matches at Ninian Park and played in a park near his home with his older brother Paul and his friends. Bellamy credits playing against older children as making him &quot;into a better player very quickly&quot;. 

He first attended Baden Powell Primary School before switching to Trowbridge Juniors where he joined the school football team at the age of seven. Despite being younger than most of the other players, he was selected to play and featured in his first match against Gladstone Primary School. Local team Pentwyn Dynamo took an interest in Bellamy but were put off by his small size; his father offered to form a team if Bellamy could find enough players. Soon after, the under-10s side of local team Caer Castell FC was formed, and Bellamy scored all four goals in the club&#x27;s first fixture. He was later picked to represent both Cardiff Schools and a Cardiff and District side in national competition. He went on to attend Rumney High School, but left the school with no GCSEs.

At the age of 12, Bellamy became friends with a group of mostly older boys and began to regularly drink alcohol and skipped school for up to two weeks at a time. He saw several of his friends using cannabis and sniffing glue but denies ever using the substances himself. He later admitted to acting as a lookout while his friends broke into vehicles to steal car stereos to sell for drug money. He described himself as &quot;a kid who knew he was going to be a footballer and thought he knew it all&quot;. By age 14, Bellamy was barely attending school and was smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol every day. In 1993, his brother introduced him to his future wife, Claire; Bellamy credits the relationship as a key factor in moving him away from his early troubles.

== Club career ==

=== Bristol Rovers and Norwich City ===
Bellamy attended youth sessions organised by Cardiff City in Ely for a year after being encouraged by his father. The club, however, took little interest in him as a youngster and, at nine-years-old, he joined Bristol Rovers after being spotted by former professional Stan Montgomery, who was working for Rovers. Although an hour&#x27;s drive from his family home, Bellamy was swayed by the better coaching and his own playing kit. He spent two years with Bristol Rovers before being spotted by a scout working for Norwich City. The club invited Bellamy to a trial match in Somerset where he impressed and was asked to travel with the side to compete in the Dana Cup, an international youth football tournament held in Hjørring, Denmark. His performances led to a permanent place with the Canary Rangers, Norwich&#x27;s youth development side. Prior to signing with the club, several other teams took an interest in Bellamy; Leeds United offered his parents £10,000 if he signed for them. Norwich responded by guaranteeing him a two-year YTS contract when he was old enough to sign. Bellamy travelled to Norwich by train on Saturday afternoons, then played a youth match on Sunday morning before returning to Cardiff.

At the age of 15, Bellamy moved away from Cardiff to start his youth apprenticeship with Norwich, being placed with a local family along with another apprentice. His first year away from home proved troublesome and he describes it as &quot;the hardest year of my life&quot;, regularly crying himself to sleep due to homesickness. Each apprentice was assigned to a senior player for whom they performed basic tasks such as cleaning boots or making tea. Bellamy was paired with John Polston but found the experienced defender difficult to work with and believed Polston tried to &quot;humiliate&quot; him. 

Bellamy&#x27;s homesickness was lessened after he became friends with another apprentice from Cardiff, Tom Ramasut, but problems with his discipline became commonplace. On one occasion, Bellamy received a final warning from staff after he broke the arm of a trialist goalkeeper during a fight on the training ground; Bellamy later wrote that he believed Norwich showed him leniency when disciplining him in fear of losing a player regarded as having a bright future. Bellamy reached a turning point in his career when his girlfriend Claire became pregnant while he was a youth player. He has credited this as a catalyst for his career that saw him become more determined to become a professional footballer, stating, &quot;I have had the career I have had because of that moment when Claire phoned me up to tell me she was pregnant&quot;. At the end of the first year of his YTS deal, Bellamy was the only player promoted to the club&#x27;s reserve side by coach Mike Phelan.

Bellamy signed his first professional contract with Norwich when he turned 16, earning £250 a week, with the option to renegotiate after ten first-team appearances. He made his professional debut for Norwich on 15 March 1997 under manager Mike Walker at the age of 17, as an injury-time substitute in a 2–0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the First Division, the second tier of the English football league system. Remarking on the rushed nature of his appearance, he said, &quot;It all felt very last minute. I was wearing a kit about three sizes too big for me, I touched the ball twice, we lost 2–0 and it was over.&quot; Two further substitute appearances in fixtures against Manchester City and Oldham Athletic followed before the end of the season. 

Bellamy made his first career start for Norwich in the opening month of the following season in the first round of the League Cup against Barnet on 12 August 1997, and started in the league for the first time on 20 September against Manchester City. During the early stages of the campaign, Bellamy played his tenth match for the first team, leading to new contract negotiations. Despite an attempt by newly-promoted Premier League side Crystal Palace to sign him for £2 million, he chose to extend his deal with Norwich. On 1 November, Bellamy scored his first senior goal, the opener in a 2–2 home draw with Bury. He received his first career red card on 7 February 1998 in the 23rd minute against Manchester City, but finished his first full season with 13 goals from 38 appearances, while playing mostly as a central midfielder.

As a young player, Bellamy was unafraid to voice his opinion to more senior members of the squad. His approach annoyed some teammates who sought retribution during training sessions; Bellamy later commented, &quot;one or two of them would try to clean me out with flying tackles. They wanted to bring me down a peg or two.&quot; One training session left him &quot;nearly in tears&quot; after Kevin Scott repeatedly singled him out. Bellamy won support from his midfield partner, the experienced Peter Grant, who struck up a friendship with Bellamy. Bruce Rioch was appointed Norwich manager in 1998 and instantly moved Bellamy from central midfield to attack. The decision reaped rewards immediately; Bellamy scored seven goals in his first eight league appearances of the campaign, including his first career hat-trick on 22 August 1998 in a 4–2 home win over Queens Park Rangers. By November, he was one of the leading goalscorers in the First Division and was rewarded with a new five-year contract.

In December 1998, Bellamy suffered an injury to his left knee following a high challenge by Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Kevin Muscat that ruled him out for two months and left him with a puncture wound in his kneecap caused by one of Muscat&#x27;s studs. The tackle caused so much consternation that Rioch had to be physically restrained by his coaching staff while Bellamy&#x27;s Norwich teammate Iwan Roberts later admitted taking revenge on Muscat by stamping on his back when the pair met in a match two years later. Bellamy continued to experience soreness in the knee after his return for the remainder of the season but ended the campaign with a career high 19 goals in all competitions. 

In a pre-season friendly against Southend United prior to the following season, Bellamy ruptured his cruciate ligaments in an innocuous challenge with an opposition defender and was ruled out for between six and eight months. He made his return to the first team against Port Vale on 22 April 2000 and finished the season by scoring goals in consecutive matches against Barnsley and Sheffield United. Interest in Bellamy grew during the summer; Norwich rejected an offer of £3.5 million by Wimbledon while Newcastle United showed interest but held back from making a bid because they were waiting to sell Duncan Ferguson to finance the transfer.

===Coventry City===
As Newcastle stalled over a bid, Coventry City offered a club-record £6 million to sign Bellamy, which Norwich accepted. Bellamy was reluctant to join the club, preferring a move to Newcastle; he met with Coventry manager Gordon Strachan to discuss the transfer. Bellamy did not employ an agent at the time so asked his financial advisor to attend the meeting. His advisor had recently met former footballer John Fashanu and telephoned him for advice, leading to Fashanu arriving at the meeting unannounced. The pressure of the situation led Bellamy to agree to the move but he regretted his decision, commenting, &quot;They were persuasive. I felt undermined by the mess with Fashanu. I wanted to save face with Strachan. I felt stressed. My chest was tight because I&#x27;m asthmatic. I was struggling to breathe properly because I was so tense. I was in a state. So I did what everybody had told me not to do. I told Strachan I&#x27;d sign.&quot;

Bellamy became Coventry&#x27;s record signing, joining on 16 August 2000 as a replacement for Robbie Keane. He made his Premier League debut on the opening day of the 2000–01 season in a 3–1 defeat to Middlesbrough and converted a penalty in the following game, a 2–1 victory over Southampton. He endured a poor start to his career with Coventry, however, scoring only three league goals—two of which were penalties—by the start of December as the club found itself in the relegation zone. On 10 December 2000, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Leicester City to gain his side three crucial points and Bellamy&#x27;s form improved further after the arrival of his Wales strike-partner John Hartson. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season after the team finished 19th in the Premier League. Bellamy ended his only season at Coventry with eight goals from 39 appearances. His tally of six in the league resulted in him finishing as the club&#x27;s joint-highest goalscorer in the league, tied with Hartson and Mustapha Hadji. After leaving the club, Bellamy said, &quot;I never once enjoyed it at Coventry. I felt quite demoralised. I had enjoyed myself so much at Norwich – but I found I had taken a backward step.&quot;

=== Newcastle United ===
====Bobby Robson era====
Coventry looked to reduce their wage bill following relegation and accepted an offer of £6.5 million from Newcastle United for Bellamy. Newcastle manager Bobby Robson later wrote that Bellamy was &quot;a great player wrapped round an unusual and volatile character&quot;. Bellamy&#x27;s Newcastle debut came in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, with the club drawn against Belgian side Lokeren. In the first leg, Newcastle secured a 4–0 victory, in which Bellamy assisted Wayne Quinn and Shola Ameobi before scoring his first goal for the club in the second leg. Bellamy scored his first Premier League goal for Newcastle in a 1–1 draw against local rivals Sunderland at St James&#x27; Park on 28 August 2001. Two weeks later, he scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 victory over Brentford in the League Cup, scoring all three goals within 12 minutes. Newcastle enjoyed a positive start to the season and moved into first place on 18 December 2001 after a 3–1 win over Arsenal. Bellamy was shown a straight red card in the match after being adjudged to have swung an arm at Ashley Cole, although the decision was overturned on appeal. Under Robson, Bellamy formed a productive strike partnership with Alan Shearer; the pair scored 41 goals between them during his first year. Bellamy remarked that his pace and creativity complemented Shearer&#x27;s game.

Bellamy was one of three players sent home from a winter training camp in La Manga after missing a team meal in honour of former chairman John Hall. The group were said to be unaware of the significance of the dinner and had stayed on at a local restaurant. Later in the season, he was given a police caution for common assault after being accused of throwing a student out of teammate Kieron Dyer&#x27;s car before kicking her. Bellamy refuted the accusations and stated the incident was sparked by the student slamming the car door on his leg after she refused to get out. Newcastle&#x27;s title challenge gradually faded and Bellamy missed most of the season&#x27;s final months after tearing a tendon during a match against Sunderland. He featured once in the last three months of the campaign as Newcastle finished fourth. In his first season, Bellamy scored 14 goals for the side and was awarded the PFA Young Player of the Year award.

Bellamy underwent knee surgery during the summer break and was originally expected to be fit in time for the new season. His rehabilitation, however, was slow and he missed Newcastle&#x27;s first four fixtures of the season. After returning from injury, Bellamy made his UEFA Champions League debut against Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv and was later given a retrospective three-match ban for headbutting Tiberiu Ghioane in the latter stages of the match. On 13 November 2002, he scored two goals, including a 90th-minute winner, in a 3–2 win over Feyenoord, which took Newcastle into the second group stage of the tournament. Complications from his knee surgery caused problems throughout the season; inflammation occurred consistently after matches, leaving him struggling for fitness the following week. 

In the second round of the Champions League, during a 4–1 home defeat to Internazionale, Bellamy received the fastest red card in the competition&#x27;s history when he was sent off for swinging an arm at opposition defender Marco Materazzi five minutes into the game. Bellamy reacted to being pinched, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Bellamy began suffering from tendinitis in his knee and, following the death of his grandmother, experienced personal issues that culminated in an argument outside a Cardiff nightclub with a stranger. He was charged with the use of racially aggravated language over the incident. The charges were later dropped but Bellamy was convicted of using foul and abusive language and fined £750. He finished the 2002–03 season with nine goals in 37 appearances as Newcastle finished in third position.

During mid-2003, Bellamy was advised that he required surgery on his knee but decided to postpone the operation to play in two Euro 2004 qualifying matches for Wales at the start of the 2003–04 season. He missed several matches for Newcastle to ensure he was fit for Wales&#x27;s matches. This decision angered Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd, who tried to block Bellamy from appearing for Wales until he returned to action for his club side. Shepherd threatened to sue the Football Association of Wales (FAW) if Bellamy featured for Wales but this was later dismissed. Bellamy underwent the surgery but returned to Newcastle to be informed by Shepherd the club were willing to sell Bellamy if he failed to return to form. He missed more than three months of the campaign in recovery before returning to first-team action on 31 January 2004 in a 1–1 draw with Birmingham City. Bellamy enjoyed a prolific scoring run following his return, scoring seven goals in two months before his season was ended due to a pulled hamstring as Newcastle finished fifth. In March 2004, media reports stated Bellamy threw a chair at first-team coach John Carver after a public argument between the pair. The altercation occurred when the squad was travelling to play a UEFA Cup fixture with Real Mallorca and Bellamy refused to travel. Robson persuaded Bellamy to attend the match after a lengthy discussion; Bellamy praised Robson&#x27;s handling of the incident and blamed the argument with Carver on pranks that had got out of hand.

====Graeme Souness era====

The arrival of Patrick Kluivert from Barcelona provided increased competition for Bellamy going into the 2004–05 season and the sale of his Wales international teammate Gary Speed further weakened his position at the club. After a poor start to the season, Robson was sacked after four league matches. His replacement was Graeme Souness, a coach with a reputation as a disciplinarian and he quickly clashed with Bellamy. The pair had a public argument when Bellamy was pictured swearing at Souness after being substituted during a match and later had a physical altercation during a training session. The two stated the rift had been healed after Bellamy scored a last-minute-winning goal in a 4–3 victory over Manchester City in late October. His last goal for the club came in a UEFA Cup group stage match against Sporting CP in December, a 1–1 draw at St. James&#x27; Park; it was his 10th goal for Newcastle that season.

On 23 January 2005 Bellamy was omitted from the team for a Premier League match with Arsenal at Highbury, which Newcastle lost 1–0. Before the match, Souness stated Bellamy was left out because of a hamstring problem but in a post-match interview said it was because Bellamy was unwilling to play as a right-sided midfielder. Minutes later, Bellamy gave an interview saying he was prepared to play in any position for his club. With his Newcastle career in doubt, Bellamy later revealed he had feigned injury to leave a training session shortly before the Arsenal match. Days later, Bellamy argued with Shearer and in an interview accused Souness of lying about him and his commitment to the club. Souness responded by stating that Bellamy would never play for Newcastle again while he was manager and the club fined Bellamy two weeks&#x27; wages (about £80,000, around £120,000 in 2020). Bellamy was told to apologise to Souness but refused to do so and was subsequently excluded from first-team training. Bellamy ended his Newcastle career with a total of 42 goals from 128 appearances.

=== Celtic loan ===
On 31 January 2005, Bellamy joined Scottish Premier League side Celtic on loan for the remainder of the season. Celtic had the option of making the transfer permanent at the end of the loan. Following his departure, Souness stated it was &quot;him or me&quot; at Newcastle and that allowing Bellamy to remain would have ended his managerial career. He also criticised Bellamy&#x27;s goalscoring record, commenting; &quot;he&#x27;s averaged 9.3 goals per season. Half of those were not in the top flight. We need two strikers near 20 goals.&quot; Bellamy rejected a £6 million transfer to Birmingham City to move to Celtic. He made his debut for the club in a 2–0 defeat against Celtic&#x27;s Old Firm rivals Rangers on 20 February. The following week, he scored his first goal in a 5–0 win against Scottish First Division side Clyde in the Scottish Cup. 

Bellamy scored a hat-trick for Celtic against Dundee United during a 3–2 victory and later scored the opening goal in a 2–1 victory over Rangers at Ibrox, a crucial game for Celtic. On the final day of the season, Celtic led rivals Rangers by two points heading into the team&#x27;s final fixture against Motherwell but suffered a defeat that, coupled with a Rangers win over Hibernian, cost them the title. Bellamy&#x27;s last game of his loan spell was the 2005 Scottish Cup Final, in which he secured the first major trophy of his career after Celtic defeated Dundee United 1–0 at Hampden Park. Bellamy finished the season having scored 19 goals altogether for Newcastle and Celtic.

Bellamy&#x27;s club and international strike partner John Hartson wanted him to make his transfer permanent, saying &quot;He&#x27;ll never get the adulation he receives here anywhere else, even if he were to sign for Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal&quot;. Celtic, however, were unable to meet Newcastle&#x27;s valuation of Bellamy or his wage demands.

=== Blackburn Rovers ===
With Newcastle seeking to sell, Bellamy attracted interest from numerous clubs, including Aston Villa, Fiorentina and Benfica, before agreeing terms with Everton following discussions with manager David Moyes. Bellamy, however, backed out of the transfer after his final meeting with Moyes, describing him as &quot;tense and hostile&quot;. He instead signed for Blackburn Rovers, managed by his former Wales coach Mark Hughes, for an undisclosed fee. Bellamy described the presence of Hughes and Wales teammate Robbie Savage as a major factor in his decision to join the side. He made his debut on the opening day of the 2005–06 season in a 3–1 defeat to West Ham United but picked up a thigh strain that ruled him out for several weeks. Although his early months at the club were disrupted with injury, featuring in only 13 matches by the end of December, he scored 17 goals for Rovers in 2005–06 in all competitions, including a career-high top tier total of 11 in 20 appearances, in a successful but injury-tempered season.

Blackburn finished in sixth place in the Premier League as Hughes built the team&#x27;s attack around Bellamy. The top-six finish marked a vast improvement on the previous season&#x27;s 15th position, qualifying the club for the 2006–07 UEFA Cup. The side also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup before being eliminated by Manchester United. Bellamy was subsequently given the club&#x27;s inaugural Player of the Year award, which was voted for by fans, and Hughes discussed plans with Bellamy to appoint him team captain for the following season. Bellamy has credited Hughes with &quot;restoring his career&quot; during his time at Blackburn.

=== Liverpool ===
On 20 June 2006, Bellamy was the subject of a £6 million transfer bid from Liverpool, triggering a clause in his contract that obliged Blackburn to allow him permission to talk to the club. Blackburn had previously opened discussions about paying £2 million to remove the clause with Bellamy but negotiations had not been completed when Liverpool made their bid. Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez had identified Bellamy as a replacement for Djibril Cissé, who had suffered a broken leg during an international fixture. As a boyhood fan of the club, Bellamy described the move as &quot;like a dream&quot; and took a reduction in wages to join Liverpool.

Bellamy made a goalscoring debut for Liverpool against Maccabi Haifa in the first leg of the Champions League third qualifying round on 9 August 2006, in a 2–1 victory. He went on to set up the winning goal for Peter Crouch in the 81st minute of the 2006 FA Community Shield with a cross from the left-hand corner of the box. His first months at the club were overshadowed by an impending court case over an alleged assault of two women in a Cardiff nightclub in February 2006. The case reached court in November but was dismissed by the judge; the defence stated that the prosecution&#x27;s evidence &quot;was a shambles&quot;. In his first appearance following the court case, Bellamy scored two goals during a 4–0 victory over Wigan Athletic on 2 December 2006. He continued his good form throughout the month, scoring two weeks later against Charlton Athletic and soon after against Watford.

In February 2007, Bellamy was involved in a fight with teammate John Arne Riise during a training session in Portugal ahead of a Champions League tie with Barcelona. The pair had argued in a bar on the final night before Riise had returned to his hotel room. Bellamy, fuelled by alcohol, remained irate and went to Riise&#x27;s hotel room with a golf club. Finding the room unlocked, Bellamy entered to find his teammate asleep. Bellamy later stated, &quot;I just whacked him across the buttocks with the club. You couldn&#x27;t really call it a swing. It was just a thwack really.&quot; Riise refuted Bellamy&#x27;s description in his own autobiography and said the incident was much more violent and that Bellamy took several forceful swings with the club at him before leaving. Bellamy apologised to Riise the next morning. He was fined two weeks wages by the club. The incident earned him the nickname &quot;The Nutter with the Putter&quot; in the media.

In the first match following the incident, a Champions League last-16 round match against Barcelona, Bellamy celebrated his goal that tied the score at 1–1 by emulating a golf stroke. Although Liverpool had a disappointing finish in the Premier League, they reached the final of the Champions League where they lost 2–1 to A.C. Milan with Bellamy an unused substitute. He expressed frustration over Benitez&#x27;s decision to use his final substitute in the match to make a defensive change despite trailing 2–0. During the plane flight home, Benitez informed Bellamy the club were planning to sign a new forward at the end of the season and that he was free to move on.

=== West Ham United ===
Everton and Aston Villa again enquired about Bellamy; Sam Allardyce, who was manager of Newcastle, was rejected over a suggested swap deal involving Michael Owen. Bellamy instead moved to West Ham United on 10 July 2007 for a fee of £7.5 million, signing a five-year contract as the club brought in several new players including Kieron Dyer and Scott Parker under new chairman Eggert Magnússon. The fee paid for Bellamy was a club record at the time. He made his West Ham debut in an opening-day 2–0 home defeat by Manchester City on 11 August. His first two goals for the club were scored in a 2–1 League Cup victory against Bristol Rovers two weeks later. Bellamy and his wife saw the birth of their third child during his early period at West Ham. He later described how being away from the family home in Cardiff for extended periods caused him to suffer from homesickness for the first time since he was a youth player. He also began suffering from arthritis that required surgery; he made a brief return in October, playing two matches for Wales and one for West Ham. The injury, however, continued causing problems and after playing in a 1–0 defeat to Wigan in February, he was ruled out for the remainder of the season.

Bellamy spent mid-2008 in the Algarve training with a physiotherapist to regain fitness. A hamstring injury sustained in a pre-season fixture against Ipswich Town disrupted Bellamy&#x27;s start to the new season; he returned to action for West Ham in the third game of the 2008–09 season, scoring the third goal in a 4–1 win over Blackburn Rovers. Early in the season, manager Alan Curbishley was replaced by Gianfranco Zola but the club struggled for results. Bellamy attracted the attention of several clubs; in the January 2009 transfer window he was the subject of a bidding war between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City. Tottenham bid an initial £6 million and eventually agreed a fee with West Ham but Bellamy refused to hand in a transfer request when West Ham asked him to, believing the club wanted to imply he had pushed for the transfer. Two offers from Manchester City were rejected but on 18 January 2009, West Ham accepted from a third undisclosed bid from City, said to be around £14 million. Bellamy later said Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp informed him that, despite having no interest in the player, Manchester City had threatened to sign Redknapp&#x27;s transfer target Wilson Palacios as retaliation for Tottenham signing Bellamy. Bellamy grew frustrated with the prolonged transfer negotiations and told staff at West Ham he wanted to remain and sign a new deal with the club. West Ham, however, continued with the move and accepted Manchester City&#x27;s bid.

=== Manchester City ===
On 19 January 2009, Bellamy completed his move to Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £14 million, reuniting with his former Blackburn manager Mark Hughes. Hughes stated, &quot;I&#x27;m sure Craig will be excellent for us, I think people will soon see why I wanted to bring him to the club&quot;. This took his career-total transfer fees to £47m. Bellamy arrived as part of Manchester City&#x27;s increased spending following the investment of the Abu Dhabi United Group; Wayne Bridge, Nigel de Jong and Shay Given also arrived within a week. Bellamy marked his debut for Manchester City on 28 January by scoring the winning goal in a 2–1 win against Newcastle United at the City of Manchester Stadium. He scored again against Middlesbrough in the Premier League in a 1–0 win for City; it was his third appearance before scoring twice against FC Copenhagen in the UEFA Cup two weeks later. Despite investment, the side lacked consistency in the league, which Bellamy attributed to a &quot;clique&quot; of Brazilian players who had arrived at the club; Robinho, Elano and Gláuber, with all of whom Bellamy clashed on several occasions. He argued with the group on more than one occasion and accused them of lacking effort following a 2–0 defeat against Portsmouth on 14 February 2009. Bellamy made only four further appearances during the season after suffering a knee injury against West Ham on 1 March.

Further player purchases ahead of the 2009–10 season increased competition for Bellamy; forwards Emmanuel Adebayor and Carlos Tevez both joined the club. Bellamy&#x27;s first goal of the season came in City&#x27;s 4–2 win over Arsenal on 12 September 2009, before he set up Shaun Wright-Phillips for City&#x27;s fourth goal with a run from his own half. A week later, he scored two goals against Manchester United in a 4–3 defeat. His first goal was a strike from the edge of the box which was later named &quot;Goal of the Month&quot; for September 2009. After the match, a fan invaded the pitch but was escorted from the field; Bellamy and the fan exchanged words, prompting the player to shove him in the face. Bellamy received no contact from the FA over the incident and Manchester City stated they would not discipline Bellamy, instead offering their support to him. After a run of seven consecutive draws in the Premier League, during the last of which Bellamy was sent off for two bookable offences, Hughes was sacked as manager and replaced by Roberto Mancini. The relationship between Bellamy and Mancini had a difficult start after a clash over training schedules. Mancini had introduced double sessions, which Bellamy struggled to undertake due to his long injury history. This escalated further when Bellamy missed two weeks after aggravating his knee during a clash with Manchester United supporters on a night out. After returning to training, the pair argued after Bellamy said he was unable to train for two consecutive days due to his personal fitness plan which angered Mancini. Despite this, Bellamy remained a regular in the first team for the rest of the season, finishing the campaign with 11 goals in 40 appearances.

In August 2010, Bellamy stated that he feared that he would be omitted from Manchester City&#x27;s 25-man squad for the 2010–11 Premier League season and hinted at retirement. On 11 August 2010, he was left out of his club&#x27;s 23-man Europa League squad to face Timișoara. The next week, Bellamy was allowed to train with Cardiff City, fuelling speculation he might sign for his hometown club. When asked about such a move, Bellamy said he would &quot;love to play for Cardiff&quot;.

=== Cardiff City loan ===
On 17 August 2010, Bellamy signed for Cardiff City on a season-long loan from Manchester City. Cardiff manager Dave Jones confirmed Bellamy would become team captain for the season with former captain Mark Hudson named club captain. Manchester City had been wary of selling Bellamy to a potential divisional rival and had suggested the idea of a move to Cardiff, paying a large percentage of his wages to make the move. He made his debut for Cardiff on 21 August in a 4–0 win over Doncaster Rovers, in which he scored from a free kick. After playing the subsequent game against Portsmouth, Bellamy missed the next five games due to a buildup of fluid on his knee that required rest. He returned and scored in a 2–1 win against Barnsley on 2 October. 

Bellamy hoped to avoid further injury problems and hired Raymond Verheijen, his former fitness coach at Manchester City, to work with him during the season and paid Verheijen&#x27;s wages himself. Bellamy scored in four consecutive home-league matches against Coventry, Leeds, Watford and Reading but rarely trained as much as the first team to rest his knee, which was swelling profusely after games. He scored the winning goal in the South Wales derby against Swansea City on 6 February 2011 with a long-range shot in the final minutes of the match; it was the first time Cardiff had won at their rival&#x27;s ground since 1997.
Bellamy&#x27;s influence on the Cardiff team proved pivotal in the push for promotion, which included a 2–2 draw with league leaders Queens Park Rangers in April in which he scored the second goal. Cardiff had led the game twice before Adel Taarabt&#x27;s brace held them to a draw. Cardiff were challenging Norwich City for the second automatic promotion place in the final stages of the season when Norwich were due to meet Derby County. Before the match, Bellamy telephoned his former Blackburn and international teammate Robbie Savage who played for Derby, and offered the players £30,000 if they won the match. Norwich, however, won 3–2 following a late-injury-time goal. A defeat to Middlesbrough the following week confirmed a playoff place for Cardiff and Bellamy scored his last goal of the season with a volley in the 90th minute to draw away at Turf Moor against Burnley. In the play-offs, he suffered a hamstring injury in the opening 20 minutes of the first leg away to Reading, forcing him out of the game. Cardiff drew the match but were defeated 3–0 in the second leg with Bellamy absent.

Bellamy stated that he would like to stay with Cardiff beyond his loan spell to achieve his dream of them one day playing in the Premier League. After Cardiff manager Dave Jones&#x27; sacking, Bellamy became a surprise favourite to succeed him. Instead, his former Norwich teammate Malky Mackay was appointed and did not confirm whether he would attempt to sign Bellamy. Bellamy asked Manchester City to release him on a free transfer after they priced him at £4,000,000.

=== Return to Liverpool ===
Bellamy returned to Manchester City for pre-season training but was placed in the club&#x27;s reserves and was excluded from the first team. He eventually reached a settlement with the club to cancel the final year of his contract, allowing him to leave. He received offers from Queens Park Rangers and Stoke City but rejected both when Liverpool and Tottenham showed an interest in him. Bellamy chose to return to Liverpool, swayed by Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s presence as manager. The following day, Cardiff City said they had failed in a last-minute bid for Bellamy. Bellamy said, &quot;I&#x27;ve grown up with Kenny Dalglish, now to be signed by him is a massive honour. It&#x27;s been a long couple of months, I had to be patient and believe something like this could happen.&quot;

Bellamy&#x27;s returning debut for Liverpool came against Stoke City in a 1–0 defeat at the Britannia Stadium. He scored his first post-return goal for Liverpool against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the League Cup on 21 September, while his first league goal of his second spell came a month later against Norwich City in a 1–1 draw. On 27 November, Dalglish withdrew Bellamy from the team for the game against Manchester City following the suicide of his friend and coach Gary Speed. Two days later, Bellamy returned to the team and recorded assists for both Liverpool goals in a 2–0 win over Chelsea in the League Cup quarter-final, describing it as &quot;one of the best games I ever played&quot;. A visibly emotional Bellamy wept as the teams lined up before the match after Liverpool fans sang Speed&#x27;s name and again on the bench after being substituted in the final minutes. Speed&#x27;s death prompted Bellamy to visit Steve Rogers, a psychologist, after fearing his own personal issues could leave him in a similar position.

Featuring largely as a squad player, Bellamy made regular appearances as a substitute but enjoyed a prolonged run in the first team during the Christmas period after Luis Suárez was banned for racially abusing an opponent. On 25 January 2012, Bellamy scored the equalising goal against Manchester City to give Liverpool a 3–2 win on aggregate in the League Cup semi-final. In the final on 26 February, Liverpool met Cardiff City; Bellamy featured as a second-half substitute in place of Jordan Henderson but he did not take a penalty in the ensuing shootout after asking to be omitted from the five nominated takers. Bellamy also played a pivotal role in the club&#x27;s run to the FA Cup final, providing the assist for Andy Carroll to score the winning goal as Liverpool beat local rivals Everton 2–1 at Wembley to reach their first FA Cup final in six years. He started in the final against Chelsea, which Liverpool lost 2–1.

=== Return to Cardiff City ===
The death of Speed and the breakup of Bellamy&#x27;s marriage prompted him to return to Cardiff to be closer to his children, despite new Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers offering him the chance to stay. Talks over a possible transfer began and on 10 August 2012, Bellamy completed his free transfer to Cardiff City on a two-year deal. He made the first appearance of his second spell a week later in a 1–0 win against Huddersfield Town. After one further appearance, he requested time off to deal with personal and injury issues and did not return to the first team until mid September. On his return, Bellamy scored with a free kick against Leeds United; Cardiff won the game 2–1. Bellamy was injured during a league match against Watford in October; damage to his ankle ligaments ruled him out for nearly a month.

He returned to the side in November, featuring in back-to-back victories over Middlesbrough and Barnsley that put Cardiff top of the table. The side maintained its position for the rest of the season, and a goalless draw with Charlton on 16 April 2013 secured Cardiff&#x27;s promotion to the top tier of English football for the first time in 52 years. Bellamy broke down in delight on the pitch at the end of the game, having achieved what he called &quot;an impossible dream&quot;.

Bellamy&#x27;s first goal of the 2013–14 Premier League season on 1 February 2014 was his side&#x27;s opener in a 2–1 victory over Norwich City. The goal meant Bellamy became the first player to score for seven different clubs in the Premier League. He played 22 league games during the season but did not score another goal. Bellamy retired from football on 22 May 2014, saying: I guess over the years I&#x27;ve become accustomed to the pain from various injuries, but for the last three to four years I&#x27;ve been on anti-inflammatories every day. I&#x27;m not sure my body will think that&#x27;s a wise thing in due course, but it kept me playing for that period. However, the time has come to stand aside and say enough. My body can&#x27;t take anymore.

== International career ==

=== Wales ===
====Youth and senior arrival====
Bellamy first represented Wales at schoolboy level in 1994 but came under pressure in an under-performing side. The manager fielded telephone calls from the parents of other players who said Bellamy was too small to play in the side. He progressed through the under-17 and under-18 levels before manager Tom Walley called him up to the under-21 side for the first time at the age of 16. He made his debut as a substitute in a match against San Marino, becoming the youngest player to represent the side. Bellamy, however, began to regard the under-21 side as setting him back in his career as he was often relegated to the bench at Norwich after spending up to ten days at a time away on international duty. This led to him asking officials at Norwich to claim he was injured, sparing him from being named in the side.

Bellamy was called into the senior Wales squad in 1998 by manager Bobby Gould, who was renowned for his unusual methods. During Bellamy&#x27;s first training session with the first team, Gould was involved in a wrestling match with John Hartson that left Gould with a bloodied nose. Bellamy made his international debut on 25 March 1998 at the age of 18 as a substitute in place of Gareth Taylor in a friendly game against Jamaica at Ninian Park. At the end of the 1997–98 season, Bellamy was included in a squad for friendlies against Malta and Tunisia, scoring his first international goal during a 3–0 victory against the former on 3 June 1998. A defeat to Tunisia resulted in a confrontation between Gould and the squad over the standard of the team. After a brief return to the under-21 side, Bellamy began to become a regular fixture in the senior squad during UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying and scored a late-winning goal in a match against Denmark. Gould was sacked after a 4–0 defeat to Italy in June 1999.

When Mark Hughes was appointed as Wales&#x27; manager, Bellamy was suffering from injury and missed the first match to be played at the Millennium Stadium, although he was included in the training squad. He returned at the end of the 1999–2000 season, playing in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal. Under Hughes, Wales&#x27; form improved significantly and the side enjoyed a strong qualifying campaign for UEFA Euro 2004. In their opening match, Wales defeated Finland before facing Italy on 16 October 2002. Wales took an early lead through Simon Davies before Alessandro Del Piero levelled after 30 minutes with a deflected free-kick. In the 70th minute, Hartson received the ball and played-in Bellamy, who rounded Gianluigi Buffon to score Wales&#x27; winning goal. Consecutive victories over Azerbaijan put Wales into a strong position in the group but they failed to win any of last four matches, losing to Serbia and Montenegro (twice) and Italy, and drawing with Finland. Bellamy became involved in a row with his club side Newcastle over his participation after he postponed a knee operation to play in the qualifiers. Wales finished second in the group, four points behind winners Italy, reaching a two-legged playoff match against Russia for a place at the finals. Bellamy missed both legs due to his knee injury that had plagued him prior to the matches and Wales lost 1–0 on aggregate.

====Captaincy and retirement====
Hughes stepped down as Wales&#x27; manager in 2004 and was replaced by John Toshack. Bellamy missed most of the new manager&#x27;s first year due to injury. In October 2006, Toshack awarded Bellamy the captain&#x27;s armband when Ryan Giggs was unavailable for a Euro 2008 qualifying match against Slovakia on 7 October 2006. The match ended in a 5–1 defeat at home to the Slovaks.

Four days later, in a match against Cyprus—Bellamy&#x27;s second as captain—he scored the third goal for Wales in a 3–1 win after setting up Robert Earnshaw for his side&#x27;s second. Toshack praised Bellamy following the victory, stating, &quot;Craig has been excellent. He has grown into the job since he has been with us, he has understood the extra responsibilities and it showed on the pitch.&quot; When Giggs returned to the Wales squad in November 2006, Bellamy was relieved of the captaincy but was named vice-captain. In June 2007, Giggs announced his retirement from international football and Toshack named Bellamy as permanent captain. Further injury problems restricted Bellamy&#x27;s appearances for Wales; he missed nearly eight months between October 2007 and May 2008. He returned to win his 50th international cap in a friendly against Iceland on 29 May.

In October 2010, a &#x27;club v country&#x27; row emerged as Bellamy played a full match for Cardiff City despite his manager Dave Jones claiming Bellamy was too injured to play for Wales. Toshack resigned in September 2010 and Bellamy later criticised his former manager, stating; &quot;The height of Toshack&#x27;s ambitions appeared to be making sure we didn&#x27;t get too heavily beaten rather than actually trying to win games. We didn&#x27;t even try and compete and I found that hard.&quot;

In December 2010, Gary Speed, Bellamy&#x27;s former team-mate at both Newcastle and Wales, was appointed manager of Wales. Bellamy was planning to retire from international football due to continuing knee problems and to stand aside for a younger generation of players. He met with Speed in Cardiff to discuss his future. Speed persuaded Bellamy to prolong his international career but Bellamy decided to step down as captain because his fitness levels meant he was unlikely to play every match. Speed sought Bellamy&#x27;s opinion on his replacement as captain; the pair agreed on Aaron Ramsey, who was appointed soon after. Raymond Verheijen and Damian Roden, fitness coaches with whom Bellamy had previously worked, were also hired on his recommendation. Although Wales endured a disappointing start to the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying campaign, Bellamy was encouraged by the progress being made under Speed&#x27;s management, including victories over Switzerland and Norway. Speed committed suicide two weeks after the Norway match; Bellamy&#x27;s next appearance for Wales was as captain in a memorial match against Costa Rica with Ramsey absent. Bellamy continued with Wales for a further 18 months under new manager Chris Coleman before announcing his retirement from international football after Wales&#x27; final 2014 World Cup qualifiers in October 2013. His final match for Wales on 15 October 2013 against Belgium ended as a 1–1 draw. Bellamy ended his international career with 78 caps and 19 goals.

=== Great Britain ===
In June 2012, Bellamy was confirmed as one of the three over-aged players selected by manager Stuart Pearce for Great Britain to compete at the 2012 Summer Olympics alongside Micah Richards and Giggs. After a warm-up match against Brazil, on 26 July Bellamy scored Great Britain&#x27;s first goal at an Olympic Games since 1960 in a 1–1 draw with Senegal. Bellamy and his other Welsh teammates were criticised for not singing the British national anthem God Save the Queen during the pre-match ceremonies. He later stated; &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to sing the national anthem and nor was any other Welsh player. It&#x27;s not our anthem. I sing one anthem and that&#x27;s that. That&#x27;s my country&#x27;s anthem. I&#x27;m not being anti-English or anti-British ... you have to remember that we took some stick in Wales just for playing for Team GB.&quot;

Bellamy assisted Giggs to score the opening goal of a 3–1 victory over the United Arab Emirates in the team&#x27;s following fixture. He was named Great Britain&#x27;s captain for the final group game, from which Giggs was absent. The side won a 1–0 victory over Uruguay at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The result allowed Great Britain to progress to a quarter-final with South Korea. Bellamy was substituted minutes before the end of normal time. The game went to extra time and penalties; Great Britain were eliminated after losing the shootout 5–4.

==Style of play==
Bellamy has been described as having a dynamic style of play with quick, bursting technique and calmness under pressure. He began his career as a central midfielder, but was moved further forward during his time with Norwich and featured in several attacking roles, playing as both a winger and a centre-forward for the remainder of his career. He preferred playing a counter-attacking style of football as his pace often allowed him to exploit space behind the defenders as the opposition team pressed forward. As Premier League managers shifted toward favouring strikers with a more physical presence, Bellamy adapted to a wider role, studying leading wingers such as Franck Ribéry to improve his game.

His former Wales, Blackburn and Manchester City manager Mark Hughes said he loved having Bellamy on his teams because of &quot;the intensity he brings&quot; and &quot;his desire to affect the game every single time he plays&quot;. Hughes acknowledged that Bellamy developed a reputation as being sometimes difficult to work with but stated, &quot;If you understand him and support him, he will play his heart out for you&quot;. Louise Taylor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; highlighted the considerable attacking threat that Bellamy possessed and that his pace was &quot;complemented by high-calibre finishing ability&quot;. His best tally in a single season in the Premier League was 17 goals during his spell with Blackburn in 2005–06 although his goalscoring record was questioned by his former Newcastle manager Graeme Souness during his time with the club.

Although sometimes perceived as a disruptive influence on teams, former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard praised Bellamy following his arrival, commenting, &quot;I was expecting a bit of a hothead ... It surprised me how professional he was. ... how much he loved the game.&quot; Bellamy&#x27;s temperament and approach has seen him involved in several high-profile confrontations and led to him falling out with managers Souness and Roberto Mancini. Bobby Robson, who managed Bellamy for several years at Newcastle, described him as &quot;the gobbiest footballer I&#x27;ve ever met&quot; but also &quot;one of the most committed&quot;. In his autobiography, former Wales manager John Toshack described a fractious relationship with Bellamy, saying, &quot;he could cause problems where they weren&#x27;t necessary and you always felt there was a possibility that he could upset the applecart&quot;. He also blamed Bellamy&#x27;s relative lack of trophy wins during his career as partly to blame; &quot;a lot of managers signed him but a lot of managers got rid of him as well; ... all were trophy winners, but none of them won anything with Bellamy in the team&quot;. Toshack did concede that Bellamy was an important attacking threat for the Welsh squad and that there was never a doubt over his inclusion.

Bellamy&#x27;s career was severely hampered by persistent injuries that restricted both the amount of time he could train and the number of matches he could play in close proximity. Gianfranco Zola, who managed Bellamy at West Ham, stated, &quot;Injuries have been the downside of his career ... The fragility he has got in the muscles has stopped him from being a higher player&quot;. In the latter stages of his career, as his pace diminished, he received praise from Paul Abbandonato of &quot;WalesOnline&quot; for possessing &quot;leadership, drive, energy, work-rate and standards of excellence&quot; during his last playing season.

==Coaching career==
Bellamy returned to Cardiff as an academy coach on a voluntary basis. In 2016, he was appointed Cardiff&#x27;s player development manager, overseeing all age groups at the club&#x27;s youth academy and coaching the older age-group teams. Having earlier been interviewed for the post of Wales manager, he was given permission to apply for the vacant managerial position at EFL League One club Oxford United in February 2018. Bellamy agreed terms with Oxford but later withdrew his application after the club was taken over during the negotiations. He stepped down from his coaching role at Cardiff in January 2019 to defend himself against a claim of bullying a youth-team player. An internal investigation by the club later resulted in Bellamy issuing an apology over an &quot;unacceptable coaching environment&quot;, although he was subject to no formal disciplinary action.

In June 2019, Bellamy signed a three-year contract to become the under-21 team coach for Belgian side Anderlecht following the appointment of his former Manchester City teammate Vincent Kompany as manager. He later worked as an assistant to Kompany before stepping down from the role in September 2021 citing mental health issues. In July 2022, he rejoined Vincent Kompany and was named a first team coach at Burnley.

On 30 May 2024, after Kompany left to join Bayern Munich in the wake of Burnley&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, Bellamy was appointed acting head coach.

On 9 July 2024, Bellamy was appointed as head coach of the Wales national team. Following Wales 1–0 victory over Montenegro in the Nations League, Bellamy became the first Wales manager in history to remain unbeaten in his first four matches.

== Personal life ==
Bellamy has described himself as a &quot;keen&quot; supporter of both Liverpool and Cardiff City. Bellamy met Claire Jansen in Cardiff while they were teenagers. They remained together despite Bellamy spending most of his time away from the city during his apprenticeship with Norwich City; Claire remained in Cardiff working in a local newsagent. Bellamy and Claire had their first child together—a son named Ellis—at the ages of 17 and 16 respectively. Claire and Ellis remained in Cardiff while Bellamy commuted to Norwich. The couple eventually moved into their own accommodation in 1996 after Bellamy signed his first professional playing contract. Their second child, Cameron, was born in January 2001 and their third, Lexi, in 2007.

Bellamy proposed to Jansen on 13 July 2005 at The Lowry Hotel in Manchester, and they married in June 2006 at St Bride&#x27;s Church in St. Brides-super-Ely, a village near Cardiff. With Bellamy moving clubs on a regular basis, the family bought a permanent home in Peterston-super-Ely; Bellamy lived near his club and travelled home when possible. The couple divorced in December 2012; his wife cited &quot;unreasonable behaviour&quot;. In his autobiography, Bellamy stated the couple split after &quot;she decided she&#x27;d had enough. Enough of the moving and the following me round. Enough of the absentee husband. Enough of the selfishness and the black moods and the times when I wouldn&#x27;t talk to her because I was worried about a knee injury.&quot;

In 2013, Bellamy released his autobiography entitled &quot;GoodFella&quot; which was ghostwritten by journalist Oliver Holt. In the book, Bellamy said he suffered severe bouts of depression, particularly when he was unable to play football for long periods due to injury. He wrote, &quot;There would be weeks, sometimes months, when I couldn&#x27;t get myself out of it&quot;. These periods often coincided with periods of binge drinking; after Cardiff&#x27;s defeat to Reading in the playoff semi-final, Bellamy went on a &quot;two-day drinking binge&quot;. In 2013, he failed to declare himself as the driver of a car that was caught by a speed camera and received a driving ban. In March 2019, he was banned from driving again for 18 months after being found to be over the permitted alcohol limit while driving in Cardiff earlier that month. Bellamy is an advocate of mixed martial arts and has sponsored some of the fighters who train at Tillery Combat, a gym in Abertillery, Wales, providing them with supplements, kit and management advice through his company Shin2Chin. He also owns Cardiff Combat MMA gym.

=== Philanthropy ===

In 2007, Bellamy visited Sierra Leone. The country was still suffering from the effects of a long civil war that ended five years previously. Bellamy was mobbed by fans and was unable to freely walk the streets without an armed police escort as crowds blocked roads trying to see him. He visited the country&#x27;s diamond mining industry and was shocked at the poor living conditions of the workers, often children. He decided to set up a charity in the country and, on 6 May 2008, plans for The Craig Bellamy Foundation were announced in Sierra Leone. Bellamy spent £1.4m of his own money to build a not-for-profit football academy in the Western Area Rural District village Tombo, where 32 boys received an international standard education and elite-level football coaching at no cost to themselves. The first 15 children were enrolled at the academy in August 2010.

The Craig Bellamy Foundation also operated a nationwide youth league that was founded in conjunction with UNICEF. Operating in the Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni regions, The Craig Bellamy Foundation League provided a national youth football framework for children; as well as on-pitch performance, points were awarded for school attendance, fair play and contributions to community projects. The league also funded the school fees of participating children and employed 175 Sierra Leonian team coaches, regional managers and league coordinators. In 2009, 1,600 boys aged between 11 and 14 played or trained in the league on a daily basis. All activities were stopped in April 2017 due to financial irregularities.

Bellamy is also a supporter of Noah&#x27;s Ark Children&#x27;s Hospital for Wales, part of the University of Wales Hospital, where both he and his three children were born. In 2010, he became a charity champion for Noah&#x27;s Ark, a charity that was aiming to raise £7 million to complete a construction project at the site.

=== Bankruptcy ===
In April 2023, Bellamy said that he was bankrupt due to failed investments that had been made on his behalf.

<text>In creation myths, the term &quot;Five Suns&quot; refers to the belief of certain Nahua cultures and Aztec peoples that the world has gone through five distinct cycles of creation and destruction, with the current era being the fifth. It is primarily derived from a combination of myths, cosmologies, and eschatological beliefs that were originally held by pre-Columbian peoples in the Mesoamerican region, including central Mexico, and it is part of a larger mythology of Fifth World or Fifth Sun beliefs. 

The late Postclassic Aztecs created and developed their own version of the &quot;Five Suns&quot; myth, which incorporated and transformed elements from previous Mesoamerican creation myths, while also introducing new ideas that were specific to their culture.

In the Aztec and other Nahua creation myths, it was believed that the universe had gone through four iterations before the current one, and each of these prior worlds had been destroyed by Gods due to the behavior of its inhabitants.

The current world is a product of the Aztecs&#x27; self-imposed mission to provide Tlazcaltiliztli to the sun, giving it the nourishment it needs to stay in existence and ensuring that the entire universe remains in balance. Thus, the Aztecs’ sacrificial rituals were essential to the functioning of the world, and ultimately to its continued survival.

== Legend ==

According to the legend, from the void that was the rest of the universe, the first god, Ometeotl, created itself. The nature of Ometeotl, the &quot;God of duality&quot; was both male and female, shared by Ometecuhtli, &quot;Lord of duality,&quot; and Omecihuatl, &quot;Lady of duality&quot;. Ometeotl gave birth to four children, the four Tezcatlipocas, who each preside over one of the four cardinal directions. Over the West presides the White Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, the god of light, mercy and wind. Over the South presides the Blue Tezcatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. Over the East presides the Red Tezcatlipoca, Xipe Totec, the god of gold, farming and spring time. And over the North presides the Black Tezcatlipoca, also called simply Tezcatlipoca, the god of judgment, night, deceit, sorcery and the Earth. 

The Aztecs believed that the gods created the universe at Teotihuacan. The name was given by the Nahuatl-speaking Aztecs centuries after the fall of the city around 550 CE. The term has been glossed as &quot;birthplace of the gods&quot;, or &quot;place where gods were born&quot;, reflecting Nahua creation myths that were said to occur in Teotihuacan.

=== First sun ===
It was four gods who eventually created all the other gods and the world we know today, but before they could create they had to destroy, for every time they attempted to create something, it would fall into the water beneath them and be eaten by Cipactli, the giant earth crocodile, who swam through the water with mouths at every one of her joints. From the four Tezcatlipocas descended the first people who were giants. They created the other gods, the most important of whom were the water gods: Tlaloc, the god of rain and fertility and Chalchiuhtlicue, the goddess of lakes, rivers and oceans and also the goddess of beauty. To give light, they needed a god to become the sun and the Black Tezcatlipoca was chosen, but either because he had lost a leg or because he was god of the night, he only managed to become half a sun. The world continued on in this way for some time, but a sibling rivalry grew between Quetzalcoatl and his brother the mighty sun, who Quetzalcoatl eventually decided to knock from the sky with a stone club. With no sun, the world was totally black and in his anger, Tezcatlipoca commanded his jaguars to eat all the people.

=== Second sun ===
The gods created humans who were of normal stature, with Quetzalcoatl serving as the sun for the new civilization, as an attempt to bring balance to the world, but their attempts ultimately failed as humans began to drift away from the beliefs and teachings of the gods and instead embraced greed and corruption.

As a consequence, Tezcatlipoca showcased his dominance and strength as a god of magic and justice by transforming the human-like people into monkeys. Quetzalcoatl, who had held the flawed people in great regard, was greatly distressed and sent away the monkeys with a powerful hurricane. After they were banished, Quetzalcoatl stepped down from his role as the sun and crafted a new, more perfect race of humans.

=== Third sun ===
Tlaloc was crowned the new sun, but Tezcatlipoca, the mischievous god, tricked and deceived him, snatching away the love of his life, Xochiquetzal, the deity of beauty, flowers, and corn.

Tlaloc had become so consumed by his own grief and sorrow that he was no longer able to fulfil his duties as the sun; therefore, a great drought befell the people of the world. People desperately prayed for rain and begged for mercy, but their pleas fell on deaf ears.

In a fit of rage, Tlaloc unleashed a rain of fire upon the earth, completely destroying it and leaving nothing but ashes in its wake. Following this cataclysmic event, the gods then worked together to create a new earth, allowing life to be reborn from the seemingly lifeless and barren land.

=== Fourth sun ===
The next sun and also Tlaloc&#x27;s new wife, was Chalchiuhtlicue. She was very loving towards the people, but Tezcatlipoca was not. Both the people and Chalchiuhtlicue felt his judgement when he told the water goddess that she was not truly loving and only faked kindness out of selfishness to gain the people&#x27;s praise. Chalchiuhtlicue was so crushed by these words that she cried blood for the next fifty-two years, causing a horrific flood that drowned everyone on Earth. Humans became fish in order to survive.

=== Fifth sun ===

Quetzalcoatl would not accept the destruction of his people and went to the underworld where he stole their bones from the god Mictlantecuhtli. He dipped these bones in his own blood to resurrect his people, who reopened their eyes to a sky illuminated by the current sun, Huitzilopochtli.

The Centzonhuītznāhua, or the stars of the south, became jealous of their brighter, more important brother Huitzilopochtli. Their leader, Coyolxauhqui, goddess of the moon, led them in an assault on the sun and every night they come close to victory when they shine throughout the sky, but are beaten back by the mighty Huitzilopochtli who rules the daytime sky. To aid this all-important god in his continuing war, the Aztecs offer him the nourishment of human sacrifices. They also offer human sacrifices to Tezcatlipoca in fear of his judgment, offer their own blood to Quetzalcoatl, who opposes fatal sacrifices, in thanks of his blood sacrifice for them and give offerings to many other gods for many purposes. Should these sacrifices cease, or should mankind fail to please the gods for any other reason, this fifth sun will go black, the world will be shattered by a catastrophic earthquake, and the Tzitzimitl will slay Huitzilopochtli and all of humanity.

== Variations and alternative myths ==
Most of what is known about the ancient Aztecs comes from the few codices to survive the Spanish conquest. Their myths can be confusing because of the lack of documentation and also because there are many popular myths that seem to contradict one another. This happened due to the fact that they were originally passed down by word of mouth and because the Aztecs adopted many of their gods from other tribes, both assigning their own new aspects to these gods and endowing them with those of similar gods from various other cultures. Older myths can be very similar to newer myths while contradicting one another by claiming that a different god performed the same action, probably because myths changed in correlation to the popularity of each of the gods at a given time.

Other variations on this myth state that Coatlicue, the earth goddess, was the mother of the four Tezcatlipocas and the Tzitzimitl. Some versions say that Quetzalcoatl was born to her first, while she was still a virgin, often mentioning his twin brother Xolotl, the guide of the dead and god of fire. Tezcatlipoca was then born to her by an obsidian knife, followed by the Tzitzimitl and then Huitzilopochtli. The most popular variation including Coatlicue depicts her giving birth first to the Tzitzimitl. Much later she gave birth to Huitzilopochtli when a mysterious ball of feathers appeared to her. The Tzitzimitl then decapitated the pregnant Coatlicue, believing it to be insulting that she had given birth to another child. Huitzilopochtli then sprang forth from her womb wielding a serpent of fire and began his epic war with the Tzitzimitl, who were also referred to as the Centzon Huitznahuas. Sometimes he is said to have decapitated Coyolxauhqui and either used her head to make the moon or thrown it into a canyon. Further variations depict the ball of feathers as being the father of Huitzilopochtli or the father of Quetzalcoatl and sometimes Xolotl.

Other variations of this myth claim that only Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca were born to Ometeotl, who was replaced by Coatlicue in this myth probably because it had absolutely no worshipers or temples by the time the Spanish arrived. It is sometimes said that the male characteristic of Ometeotl is named Ometecuhtli and that the female characteristic is named Omecihualt. Further variations on this myth state that it was only Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca who pulled apart Cipactli, also known as Tlaltecuhtli, and that Xipe Totec and Huitzilopochtli then constructed the world from her body. Some versions claim that Tezcatlipoca actually used his leg as bait for Cipactli, before dismembering her.

The order of the first four suns varies as well, though the above version is the most common. Each world&#x27;s end correlates consistently to the god that was the sun at the time throughout all variations of the myth, though the loss of Xochiquetzal is not always identified as Tlaloc&#x27;s reason for the rain of fire, which is not otherwise given and it is sometimes said that Chalchiuhtlicue flooded the world on purpose, without the involvement of Tezcatlipoca. It is also said that Tezcatlipoca created half a sun, which his jaguars then ate before eating the giants.

The fifth sun however is sometimes said to be a god named Nanauatzin. In this version of the myth, the gods convened in darkness to choose a new sun, who was to sacrifice himself by jumping into a gigantic bonfire. The two volunteers were the young son of Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue, Tecuciztecatl, and the old Nanauatzin. It was believed that Nanauatzin was too old to make a good sun, but both were given the opportunity to jump into the bonfire. Tecuciztecatl tried first but was not brave enough to walk through the heat near the flames and turned around. Nanauatzin then walked slowly towards and then into the flames and was consumed. Tecuciztecatl then followed. The braver Nanauatzin became what is now the sun and Tecuciztecatl became the much less spectacular moon. A god that bridges the gap between Nanauatzin and Huitzilopochtli is Tonatiuh, who was sick, but rejuvenated himself by burning himself alive and then became the warrior sun and wandered through the heavens with the souls of those who died in battle, refusing to move if not offered enough sacrifices.

==Brief summation==
*&quot;Nāhui-Ocēlōtl&quot; (Jaguar Sun) – Inhabitants were giants who were devoured by jaguars. The world was destroyed.
*&quot;Nāhui-Ehēcatl&quot; (Wind Sun) – Inhabitants were transformed into monkeys. This world was destroyed by hurricanes.
*&quot;Nāhui-Quiyahuitl&quot; (Rain Sun) – Inhabitants were destroyed by rain of fire. Only birds survived (or inhabitants survived by becoming birds).
*&quot;Nāhui-Ātl&quot; (Water Sun) – This world was flooded turning the inhabitants into fish. A couple escaped but were transformed into dogs.
*&quot;Nāhui-Olīn&quot; (Earthquake Sun) – Current humans are the inhabitants of this world. Should the gods be displeased, this world will be destroyed by earthquakes (or one large earthquake) and the Tzitzimimeh will annihilate all its inhabitants.

==In popular culture==
* The version of the myth with Nanahuatzin serves as a framing device for the 1991 Mexican film, &quot;In Necuepaliztli in Aztlan (Return a Aztlán)&quot;, by Juan Mora Catlett.
* The version of the myth with Nanahuatzin is in the 1996 film, &quot;The Five Suns: A Sacred History of Mexico&quot;, by Patricia Amlin.
* Rage Against the Machine refers to intercultural violence as &quot;the fifth sunset&quot; in their song &quot;People of the Sun&quot;, on the album &quot;Evil Empire&quot;.
* Thomas Harlan&#x27;s science fiction series &quot;In the Time of the Sixth Sun&quot; uses this myth as a central plot point, where an ancient star-faring civilization (&quot;people of the First Sun&quot;) had disappeared and left the galaxy with many dangerous artifacts.
* The &quot;Shadowrun&quot; role-playing game takes place in the &quot;Sixth World.&quot;
* The concept of the five suns is alluded to in &quot;Onyx Equinox&quot;, where Quetzalcoatl claims that the gods made humanity four times before. Tezcatlipoca seeks to end the current human era, since he believes humans are too greedy and waste their blood in battle rather than as sacrifices.
* The final episode of &quot;Victor and Valentino&quot; is called &quot;The Fall of the Fifth Sun&quot;, and also features Tezcatlipoca in a central role.

<text>Abinger Hammer is a village in the Mole Valley district of Surrey, England. It lies in the Vale of Holmesdale in the Surrey Hills National Landscape and is located on the A25 about east of Guildford and west of Dorking. The village is named after its water-powered iron forge.

== Geography ==
Abinger Hammer lies within the parish of Abinger which includes Abinger Common and Sutton Abinger. Other neighbouring villages are Wotton and Gomshall.

The River Tillingbourne flows through the village.

== History ==
The river Tillingbourne was enchannelled in the 16th century, creating a hammer pond, provided water power for Abinger Hammer Mill which worked Sussex-sourced iron. The pond has since been adapted for the cultivation of watercress.

Abinger hammer mill was in operation during the second half of the 16th century. The reputed manufacture of guns for use against the Spanish Armada has no basis in fact; the mill being incapable of casting iron. The waters of the Tillingbourne powered the water wheel which drove the heavy , hammer of the forge. The forge closed in 1787 despite attempts to save or convert it. A contemporary forge, Finch Foundry, survives in Devon.
The clock which overhangs the main road portrays the figure of &quot;Jack the Blacksmith&quot;, who strikes the hour with his hammer. The clock bears the motto &quot;By me you know how fast to go&quot;. The clock was given in memory of the first Lord Farrer of Abinger Hall who died in 1899. The clock represents the iron industry and the role played by the county of Surrey in the industrial past.

==Transport==
The A25 runs through the village. Abinger is approximately east of Gomshall railway station on the North Downs Line between Redhill and Guildford.

== Sights ==

In summer the village green in Abinger is popular with locals and tourists who like to picnic on the grass whilst watching a game of cricket in surroundings which are quintessentially English. The cricket pitch borders the Tillingbourne – the Post Office sells nets for children to &quot;fish&quot; in this shallow and sandy stream. Annie&#x27;s tearoom is next to the Post Office and offers lunches and teas seven days a week.

== Education ==
After Abinger Hammer village school was closed by the LEA in 1982, the local community took over the running of it. As of 2008 the school had only sixteen students. A small group of trustees worked to raise funds to maintain the building and to pay the staff but the number of students reduced further, until the school was forced to close in July 2009.

== Nature ==
Oxmoor Copse is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, recognised for its plant species and its aesthetic quality. It is south of the village.

== People ==
During the years 1925 to 1945, the novelist E. M. Forster lived in Abinger Hammer with his mother Alice Clare, in a house designed by his father, the architect Eddie Morgan Forster. The house had previously been occupied by his aunt Laura. Forster was obliged to leave this home in 1946 as the landlord refused to renew the lease.

Edward Wilkins Waite (1854–1924), landscape painter, lived for a time at Abinger Hammer. He was born in Leatherhead, Surrey, and much of his work depicted rural scenes in the county – including at least one picture, &quot;Old Willows&quot;, painted in the vicinity of the village.

David Nobbs gave Abinger Hammer as the location of the home of Uncle Percy Spillinger, played by late actor Tony Sympson, in Episode 4, Series 1 of &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;.

The actor John Gordon Sinclair lives in Abinger Hammer.

== Abinger Hall ==
Abinger Hammer is also home to Abinger Hall, a late 18th-century country estate, which has since fallen into disrepair. Abinger Hall was the home of William Frederick Scarlett, Baron Abinger and Helen Scarlett, Lady Abinger. It was also the birthplace of Ella Campbell Scarlett, who was the first female doctor of the state of Bloemfontein, South Africa. The Victorian house was demolished in 1959.

<doc id="575610" wikidata="Q2400637" url="?curid=575610" title="List of churches in London">
<text>This is a list of [[cathedral]]s, [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[chapel]]s in Greater London, England, which is divided into 32 London boroughs and the City of London. The list focuses on the more permanent churches and buildings which identify themselves as places of Christian worship. The denominations appended are those by which they self-identify.

==History==
===Wren and Anglican churches===
Before the Great Fire of London in 1666, the City of London had around 100 churches in an area of only one square mile (2.6 km2). Of the 86 destroyed by the Fire, 51 were rebuilt along with St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The majority have traditionally been regarded as the work of Sir Christopher Wren, but although their rebuilding was entrusted primarily to him, the role of his various associates, including Robert Hooke and Nicholas Hawksmoor especially, is currently being reassessed and given greater emphasis.

With regard to Anglican churches, as opposed to Catholic churches, nonconformist chapels or meeting houses, the designs of the Wren office provided a new standard for British church architecture ever since, as well as giving a distinctive face to the Anglican church in London. Wren also designed a number of Anglican churches outside the City, including St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly and St Clement Danes. After the Wren era, Hawksmoor was responsible for six of the great Anglican churches in the East End of London (for example Christ Church, Spitalfields), and other architects such as Hooke, James Gibbs and John James contributed significantly to Anglican church architecture in London.

===Metropolitan area===
 London&#x27;s churches and chapels are extraordinarily numerous and diverse. Anglican and nonconformist churches and chapels are most numerous, but there are also many Catholic churches as well as places of worship for non-Christian religions.

Most of the Anglican churches lie within the Anglican dioceses of London to the north and Southwark to the south. For historical reasons, the Anglican churches in London north of the Thames but east of the River Lea fall within the Diocese of Chelmsford, and those in the London Boroughs of Bexley and Bromley fall within the Diocese of Rochester. A few Anglican churches in the Barnet area fall into the Diocese of St Albans, reflecting the historical association of Barnet with Hertfordshire. The Catholic dioceses that cover Greater London are, north of the Thames and west of the Lea, the Diocese of Westminster; south of the Thames the Archdiocese of Southwark; and north of the Thames and east of the Lea, the Diocese of Brentwood. There are still some two thousand Anglican churches alone, across the capital and if nonconformist and other denominations are included, they cover every age and style, in the design and evolution of which at least six hundred different architects have made contributions. As London expanded during the early 19th century, many new churches and chapels were built independently by the growing nonconformist urban population; to match the growth in nonconformist churches and chapels, the Anglican &quot;Waterloo church&quot; building programme saw numerous Anglican churches constructed across south London in the first half of the century.

===Significance===
Although many churches and chapels were entirely or partly lost to 19th-century demolitions and to bombing in the Second World War, many historic, architecturally significant and religiously significant buildings remain, particularly in the City of London and the neighbouring City of Westminster. A number of the churches are mentioned in the nursery rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. Churches in this list belong to various denominations, as indicated.

==Non-English speaking churches==

There are many examples throughout Greater London of English-speaking churches which also provide regular worship in one or more secondary languages, particularly amongst the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. Numerous English-speaking Roman Catholic churches in London provide worship in assorted non-English languages, including Arabic, Aramaic, Cantonese, Croatian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Korean, Latin, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese (including Brazilian Portuguese), Romanian, Slovak, Spanish, Syriac, Tamil and Tigrinya.
The Eastern Orthodox churches in London also provide worship in many non-English languages, including Amharic, Arabic, Aramaic, Armenian, Georgian, Greek, Romanian, Russian, Serbian and Ukrainian.

The following table lists churches which conduct their worship in modern languages other than English, or English-speaking churches which have notable non-Anglophone congregations based in the same building.

<doc id="575611" wikidata="Q14946692" url="?curid=575611" title="Vincent Hanna">
<text>:&quot;This is also the name of a character played by Al Pacino in the 1995 film, Heat.&quot;
Vincent Leo Martin Hanna (9 August 1939 – 22 July 1997) was a Northern Irish television journalist known for his coverage of United Kingdom by-elections.

==Early life and education==
Hanna was from a Northern Ireland Catholic background and was born in Belfast. His father, Frank, was a prominent solicitor and a member of the Stormont Parliament. All five of Frank&#x27;s children would also become lawyers. Hanna was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, the Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast, Harvard University and the London School of Economics. In 1965, he was admitted as a solicitor and worked for the family legal practice in industrial injuries and civil rights cases. He moved to London in 1970.

==Journalism==
Hanna&#x27;s freelance journalism was noticed by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; editor Harold Evans, who offered him a job as an industrial relations correspondent. He embraced his new career with an enthusiasm that irritated some of his less committed colleagues. He was recruited by the BBC Current Affairs department in 1973 and became well known for his &quot;Newsnight&quot; coverage of by-elections. Fellow journalist Andrew Marr said his filmed reports were &quot;a new kind of political reporting, much copied and never rivalled, which ended forever the era when parliamentary by-elections were obscure and largely unreported contests&quot;. His third campaign was spent doggedly pursuing candidates with difficult questions. Very few escaped unscathed. At Darlington in March 1983, Hanna&#x27;s broadcasts helped to destroy the campaign of SDP candidate Tony Cook, who had been the early favourite to win.

In 1984, Hanna&#x27;s impartiality came into question when he failed to disguise his support for tactical voting in some reports on the Chesterfield by-election of that year. The Labour candidate, Tony Benn, accused him of acting as the SDP candidate. During the Greenwich by-election of February 1987, he publicly accused Angela Rumbold, a Conservative Minister, of being a liar. Rumbold had cross-examined him over the alleged impartiality of a public opinion poll which showed the SDP candidate closing on the Labour candidate.

==Later career==
Such was Hanna&#x27;s identification with by-elections that in 1987 he was a guest star in &quot;Blackadder the Third&quot;, reporting on S. Baldrick&#x27;s victory at the rotten borough of Dunny-on-the-Wold in the episode &quot;Dish and Dishonesty&quot; (and credited as &quot;his own great-great-great-grandfather&quot;). By this time, however, Hanna had left the BBC to set up his own freelance production company which specialised in trade union issues and mainly worked for the public service television station Channel 4. Alongside Andrew Rawnsley, he also co-presented &quot;A Week in Politics&quot; for the channel from 1989 until his death. He was an active broadcaster on BBC Radio 5 Live from 1994.

From 1996 he presented &quot;Medium Wave&quot; on BBC Radio 4 and also hosted two series of the panel game &quot;Cross Questioned&quot; (the second was broadcast posthumously). His media company gave public relations advice to several local authorities on presentation.

Hanna was an active trade unionist in the National Union of Journalists. He led a strike at the BBC in 1985 when the Governors, bowing to Government pressure, suppressed a documentary called &quot;Real Lives: At the Edge of the Union&quot; which covered the home life of Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin and Gregory Campbell of the Democratic Unionist Party.

==Personal life==
Hanna married Joan Fitt (a daughter of the politician Gerry Fitt) in 1975. They had two daughters. Vincent Hanna died of heart disease in 1997 at the age of 57.

<doc id="575613" wikidata="Q1946" url="?curid=575613" title="Moons of Jupiter">
<text>There are 95 moons of Jupiter with confirmed orbits . This number does not include a number of meter-sized moonlets thought to be shed from the inner moons, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized outer irregular moons that were only briefly captured by telescopes. All together, Jupiter&#x27;s moons form a satellite system called the Jovian system. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 91 known moons and the rings together comprising just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.

Of Jupiter&#x27;s moons, eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter&#x27;s equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and are just massive enough that they would be considered major planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites, known as the inner moons, are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter&#x27;s rings. The remainder of Jupiter&#x27;s moons are outer irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. The largest of these moons were likely asteroids that were captured from solar orbits by Jupiter before impacts with other small bodies shattered them into many kilometer-sized fragments, forming collisional families of moons sharing similar orbits. Jupiter is expected to have about 100 irregular moons larger than in diameter, plus around 500 more smaller retrograde moons down to diameters of . Of the 87 known irregular moons of Jupiter, 38 of them have not yet been officially given names.

==Characteristics==

The physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over in diameter; the largest Galilean, Ganymede, is the ninth largest object in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being larger than Mercury. All other Jovian moons are less than in diameter, with most barely exceeding . Their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter&#x27;s rotation (retrograde motion).

==Origin and evolution==

Jupiter&#x27;s regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of gravitated gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk. They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter&#x27;s history.

Simulations suggest that, while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tens of a percent) of the mass of Jupiter captured from the solar nebula was passed through it. However, only 2% of the proto-disk mass of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus, several generations of Galilean-mass satellites may have been in Jupiter&#x27;s early history. Each generation of moons might have spiraled into Jupiter, because of drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned so that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons&#x27; orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance with each other, which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede: they are in a 1:2:4 resonance. Ganymede&#x27;s larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io. Tidal dissipation in the Jovian system is still ongoing and Callisto will likely be captured into the resonance in about 1.5 billion years, creating a 1:2:4:8 chain.

The outer, irregular moons are thought to have originated from captured asteroids, whereas the proto-lunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many are believed to have been broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.

==History and discovery==
===Visual observations===
Chinese historian Xi Zezong claimed that the earliest record of a Jovian moon (Ganymede or Callisto) was a note by Chinese astronomer Gan De of an observation around 364 BC regarding a &quot;reddish star&quot;. However, the first certain observations of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites were those of Galileo Galilei in 1609. By January 1610, he had sighted the four massive Galilean moons with his 20× magnification telescope, and he published his results in March 1610.

Simon Marius had independently discovered the moons one day after Galileo, although he did not publish his book on the subject until 1614. Even so, the names Marius assigned are used today: Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa. No additional satellites were discovered until E. E. Barnard observed Amalthea in 1892.

===Photographic and spacecraft observations===

With the aid of telescopic photography with photographic plates, further discoveries followed quickly over the course of the 20th century. Himalia was discovered in 1904, Elara in 1905, Pasiphae in 1908, Sinope in 1914, Lysithea and Carme in 1938, Ananke in 1951, and Leda in 1974.

By the time that the Voyager space probes reached Jupiter, around 1979, thirteen moons had been discovered, not including Themisto, which had been observed in 1975, but was lost until 2000 due to insufficient initial observation data. The Voyager spacecraft discovered an additional three inner moons in 1979: Metis, Adrastea, and Thebe.

===Digital telescopic observations===
No additional moons were discovered until two decades later, with the fortuitous discovery of Callirrhoe by the Spacewatch survey in October 1999. During the 1990s, photographic plates phased out as digital charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras began emerging in telescopes on Earth, allowing for wide-field surveys of the sky at unprecedented sensitivities and ushering in a wave of new moon discoveries. Scott Sheppard, then a graduate student of David Jewitt, demonstrated this extended capability of CCD cameras in a survey conducted with the Mauna Kea Observatory&#x27;s UH88 telescope in November 2000, discovering eleven new irregular moons of Jupiter including the previously lost Themisto with the aid of automated computer algorithms.

From 2001 onward, Sheppard and Jewitt alongside other collaborators continued surveying for Jovian irregular moons with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), discovering an additional eleven in December 2001, one in October 2002, and nineteen in February 2003. At the same time, another independent team led by Brett J. Gladman also used the CFHT in 2003 to search for Jovian irregular moons, discovering four and co-discovering two with Sheppard. From the start to end of these CCD-based surveys in 2000–2004, Jupiter&#x27;s known moon count had grown from 17 to 63. All of these moons discovered after 2000 are faint and tiny, with apparent magnitudes between 22–23 and diameters less than . As a result, many could not be reliably tracked and ended up becoming lost.

Beginning in 2009, a team of astronomers, namely Mike Alexandersen, Marina Brozović, Brett Gladman, Robert Jacobson, and Christian Veillet, began a campaign to recover Jupiter&#x27;s lost irregular moons using the CFHT and Palomar Observatory&#x27;s Hale Telescope. They discovered two previously unknown Jovian irregular moons during recovery efforts in September 2010, prompting further follow-up observations to confirm these by 2011. One of these moons, S/2010 J 2 (now Jupiter LII), has an apparent magnitude of 24 and a diameter of only , making it one of the faintest and smallest confirmed moons of Jupiter even . Meanwhile, in September 2011, Scott Sheppard, now a faculty member of the Carnegie Institution for Science, discovered two more irregular moons using the institution&#x27;s Magellan Telescopes at Las Campanas Observatory, raising Jupiter&#x27;s known moon count to 67. Although Sheppard&#x27;s two moons were followed up and confirmed by 2012, both became lost due to insufficient observational coverage.

In 2016, while surveying for distant trans-Neptunian objects with the Magellan Telescopes, Sheppard enticingly observed a region of the sky located near Jupiter, enticing him to search for Jovian irregular moons as a detour. In collaboration with Chadwick Trujillo and David Tholen, Sheppard continued surveying around Jupiter from 2016 to 2018 using the Cerro Tololo Observatory&#x27;s Víctor M. Blanco Telescope and Mauna Kea Observatory&#x27;s Subaru Telescope. In the process, Sheppard&#x27;s team recovered several lost moons of Jupiter from 2003 to 2011 and reported two new Jovian irregular moons in June 2017. Then in July 2018, Sheppard&#x27;s team announced ten more irregular moons confirmed from 2016 to 2018 observations, bringing Jupiter&#x27;s known moon count to 79. Among these was Valetudo, which has an unusually distant prograde orbit that crosses paths with the retrograde irregular moons. Several more unidentified Jovian irregular satellites were detected in Sheppard&#x27;s 2016–2018 search, but were too faint for follow-up confirmation.

From November 2021 to January 2023, Sheppard discovered twelve more irregular moons of Jupiter and confirmed them in archival survey imagery from 2003 to 2018, bringing the total count to 92. Among these was S/2018 J 4, a highly inclined prograde moon that is now known to be in same orbital grouping as the moon Carpo, which was previously thought to be solitary. On 22 February 2023, Sheppard announced three more moons discovered in a 2022 survey, now bringing Jupiter&#x27;s total known moon count to 95. In a February 2023 interview with &quot;NPR&quot;, Sheppard noted that he and his team are currently tracking even more moons of Jupiter, which should place Jupiter&#x27;s moon count over 100 once confirmed over the next two years.

Many more irregular moons of Jupiter will inevitably be discovered in the future, especially after the beginning of deep sky surveys by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope in the mid-2020s. The Rubin Observatory&#x27;s aperture telescope and 3.5 square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter&#x27;s irregular moons down to diameters of at apparent magnitudes of 24.5, with the potential of increasing the known population by up to tenfold. Likewise, the Roman Space Telescope&#x27;s aperture and 0.28 square-degree field of view will probe Jupiter&#x27;s irregular moons down to diameters of at magnitude 27.7, with the potential of discovering approximately 1,000 Jovian moons above this size. Discovering these many irregular satellites will help reveal their population&#x27;s size distribution and impact histories, which will place further constraints to how the Solar System formed.

==Naming==

The Galilean moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) were named by Simon Marius soon after their discovery in 1610. However, these names fell out of favor until the 20th century. The astronomical literature instead simply referred to &quot;Jupiter I&quot;, &quot;Jupiter II&quot;, etc., or &quot;the first satellite of Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s second satellite&quot;, and so on. The names Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto became popular in the mid-20th century, whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in Roman numerals V (5) to XII (12). Jupiter V was discovered in 1892 and given the name &quot;Amalthea&quot; by a popular though unofficial convention, a name first used by French astronomer Camille Flammarion.

The other moons were simply labeled by their Roman numeral (e.g. Jupiter IX) in the majority of astronomical literature until the 1970s. Several different suggestions were made for names of Jupiter&#x27;s outer satellites, but none were universally accepted until 1975 when the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s (IAU) Task Group for Outer Solar System Nomenclature granted names to satellites V–XIII, and provided for a formal naming process for future satellites still to be discovered. The practice was to name newly discovered moons of Jupiter after lovers and favorites of the god Jupiter (Zeus) and, since 2004, also after their descendants. All of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites from XXXIV (Euporie) onward are named after descendants of Jupiter or Zeus, except LIII (Dia), named after a lover of Jupiter. Names ending with &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; are used for prograde irregular satellites (the latter for highly inclined satellites), and names ending with &quot;e&quot; are used for retrograde irregulars. With the discovery of smaller, kilometre-sized moons around Jupiter, the IAU has established an additional convention to limit the naming of small moons with absolute magnitudes greater than 18 or diameters smaller than . Some of the most recently confirmed moons have not received names.

Some asteroids share the same names as moons of Jupiter: 9 Metis, 38 Leda, 52 Europa, 85 Io, 113 Amalthea, 239 Adrastea. Two more asteroids previously shared the names of Jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the IAU: Ganymede and asteroid 1036 Ganymed; and Callisto and asteroid 204 Kallisto.

==Groups==
===Regular satellites===
These have prograde and nearly circular orbits of low inclination and are split into two groups:
*Inner satellites or Amalthea group: Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. These orbit very close to Jupiter; the innermost two orbit in less than a Jovian day. The latter two are respectively the fifth and seventh largest moons in the Jovian system. Observations suggest that at least the largest member, Amalthea, did not form on its present orbit, but farther from the planet, or that it is a captured Solar System body. These moons, along with a number of seen and as-yet-unseen inner moonlets (see Amalthea moonlets), replenish and maintain Jupiter&#x27;s faint ring system. Metis and Adrastea help to maintain Jupiter&#x27;s main ring, whereas Amalthea and Thebe each maintain their own faint outer rings.
*Main group or Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are some of the largest objects in the Solar System outside the Sun and the eight planets in terms of mass, larger than any known dwarf planet. Ganymede exceeds (and Callisto nearly equals) even the planet Mercury in diameter, though they are less massive. They are respectively the fourth-, sixth-, first-, and third-largest natural satellites in the Solar System, containing approximately 99.997% of the total mass in orbit around Jupiter, while Jupiter is almost 5,000 times more massive than the Galilean moons. The inner moons are in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance. Models suggest that they formed by slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebula—a disc of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation—which lasted up to 10 million years in the case of Callisto. Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are suspected of having subsurface water oceans, and Io may have a subsurface magma ocean.

===Irregular satellites===
The irregular satellites are substantially smaller objects with more distant and eccentric orbits. They form families with shared similarities in orbit (semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity) and composition; it is believed that these are at least partially collisional families that were created when larger (but still small) parent bodies were shattered by impacts from asteroids captured by Jupiter&#x27;s gravitational field. These families bear the names of their largest members. The identification of satellite families is tentative, but the following are typically listed:
* Prograde satellites:
**Themisto is the innermost irregular moon and is not part of a known family.
**The Himalia group is confined within semi-major axes between , inclinations between 27 and 29°, and eccentricities between 0.12 and 0.21. It has been suggested that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt. The largest two members, Himalia and Elara, are respectively the sixth- and eighth-largest Jovian moons.
**The Carpo group includes two known moons on very high orbital inclinations of 50° and semi-major axes between . Due to their exceptionally high inclinations, the moons of the Carpo group are subject to gravitational perturbations that induce the Lidov–Kozai resonance in their orbits, which cause their eccentricities and inclinations to periodically oscillate in correspondence with each other. The Lidov–Kozai resonance can significantly alter the orbits of these moons: for example, the eccentricity and inclination of the group&#x27;s namesake Carpo can fluctuate between 0.19–0.69 and 44–59°, respectively.
**Valetudo is the outermost prograde moon and is not part of a known family. Its prograde orbit crosses paths with several moons that have retrograde orbits and may in the future collide with them.
* Retrograde satellites:
**The Carme group is tightly confined within semi-major axes between , inclinations between 164 and 166°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.28. It is very homogeneous in color (light red) and is believed to have originated as collisional fragments from a D-type asteroid progenitor, possibly a Jupiter trojan.
**The Ananke group has a relatively wider spread than the previous groups, with semi-major axes between , inclinations between 144 and 156°, and eccentricities between 0.09 and 0.25. Most of the members appear gray, and are believed to have formed from the breakup of a captured asteroid.
**The Pasiphae group is quite dispersed, with semi-major axes spread over , inclinations between 141° and 157°, and higher eccentricities between 0.23 and 0.44. The colors also vary significantly, from red to grey, which might be the result of multiple collisions. Sinope, sometimes included in the Pasiphae group, is red and, given the difference in inclination, it could have been captured independently; Pasiphae and Sinope are also trapped in secular resonances with Jupiter.

Based on their survey discoveries in 2000–2003, Sheppard and Jewitt predicted that Jupiter should have approximately 100 irregular satellites larger than in diameter, or brighter than magnitude 24. Survey observations by Alexandersen et al. in 2010–2011 agreed with this prediction, estimating that approximately 40 Jovian irregular satellites of this size remained undiscovered in 2012.

In September 2020, researchers from the University of British Columbia identified 45 candidate irregular moons from an analysis of archival images taken in 2010 by the CFHT. These candidates were mainly small and faint, down to magnitude of 25.7 or above in diameter. From the number of candidate moons detected within a sky area of one square degree, the team extrapolated that the population of retrograde Jovian moons brighter than magnitude 25.7 is around within a factor of 2. Although the team considers their characterized candidates to be likely moons of Jupiter, they all remain unconfirmed due to insufficient observation data for determining reliable orbits. The true population of Jovian irregular moons is likely complete down to magnitude 23.2 at diameters over .

==List==
The moons of Jupiter are listed below by orbital period. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold. These are the four Galilean moons, which are comparable in size to the Moon. The other moons are much smaller. The Galilean moon with the smallest amount of mass is greater than 7,000 times more massive than the most massive of the other moons. The irregular captured moons are shaded light gray and orange when prograde and yellow, red, and dark gray when retrograde.

The orbits and mean distances of the irregular moons are highly variable over short timescales due to frequent planetary and solar perturbations, so proper orbital elements which are averaged over a period of time are preferably used. The proper orbital elements of the irregular moons listed here are averaged over a 400-year numerical integration by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory: for the above reasons, they may strongly differ from osculating orbital elements provided by other sources. Otherwise, recently discovered irregular moons without published proper elements are temporarily listed here with inaccurate osculating orbital elements that are &quot;italicized&quot; to distinguish them from other irregular moons with proper orbital elements. Some of the irregular moons&#x27; proper orbital periods in this list may not scale accordingly with their proper semi-major axes due to the aforementioned perturbations. The irregular moons&#x27; proper orbital elements are all based on the reference epoch of 1 January 2000.

Some irregular moons have only been observed briefly for a year or two, but their orbits are known accurately enough that they will not be lost to positional uncertainties.



==Exploration==


Nine spacecraft have visited Jupiter. The first were &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; in 1973, and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; a year later, taking low-resolution images of the four Galilean moons and returning data on their atmospheres and radiation belts. The &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity on Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa. &quot;Ulysses&quot; further studied Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000.

The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft was the first to enter orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying it until 2003. During this period, &quot;Galileo&quot; gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath the surfaces of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede.

Then the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe to Saturn flew by Jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the Galilean moons with Jupiter&#x27;s extended atmosphere. The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its satellites&#x27; orbital parameters.

In 2016, the &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft imaged the Galilean moons from above their orbital plane as it approached Jupiter orbit insertion, creating a time-lapse movie of their motion. With a mission extension, &quot;Juno&quot; has since begun close flybys of the Galileans, flying by Ganymede in 2021 followed by Europa and Io in 2022. It flew by Io again in late 2023 and once more in early 2024.

<text>Carl Terrell Mitchell (born November 27, 1973), better known by his stage name Twista (also known as Tung Twista), is an American rapper. He is best known for his chopper style of rapping and for once holding the title of fastest English-speaking rapper in the world according to Guinness World Records in 1992, being able to pronounce 598 syllables in 55 seconds.

In 1997, after appearing on Do or Die&#x27;s hit single &quot;Po Pimp&quot;, produced by the Legendary Traxster, Twista signed with Big Beat and Atlantic Records, where he released his third album &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; and formed the group Speedknot Mobstaz, in 1998. His 2004 album &quot;Kamikaze&quot; topped the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, after the success of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; (with Kanye West and Jamie Foxx).

==Early life==
Carl Terrell Mitchell was born on November 27, 1973, and grew up in the K-Town area of the West Garfield Park neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois, and began rapping at the age of 12.

==Career==
In 1992, Mitchell released his first album called &quot;Runnin&#x27; Off at da Mouth&quot; under the name Tung Twista.

His second album, titled &quot;Resurrection&quot;, was set to be released in 1994, but due to problems with his record label at the time Atlantic Records and marketing issues involving fellow Chicago rapper Common&#x27;s album of the same name, the album was only released in the city of Chicago and thus got little national attention.

In 1996, he teamed with Chicago producer the Legendary Traxster and Creator&#x27;s Way / CWAL artists Do or Die on the track &quot;Po Pimp&quot; produced by the Legendary Traxster, which became a hit single. This led to a CWAL&#x27;s label deal with Atlantic Records, which released &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; in 1997. Twista had by then dropped the &quot;Tung&quot; from his stage name. &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; became Twista&#x27;s first charting album, as it peaked at #77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also spawned a &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit in &quot;Get It Wet&quot; produced by the Legendary Traxster, which peaked at #96.

In 1998, Twista teamed with other Chicago area rappers to form Speedknot Mobstaz. They released their first album, &quot;Mobstability&quot;, produced entirely by the Legendary Traxster, in 1998. Twista then joined label Legit Ballin&#x27;, which released two compilation albums: &quot;Legit Ballin&quot;&#x27; in 1999 and &quot;Legit Ballin&#x27; Vol. 2: Street Scriptures&quot; in 2001. The label later released &quot;Respect the Game, Vol. 3&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Volume 4: Tha Truth&quot; in 2006. In 2000, Twista collaborated with Ruff Ryders and Drag-On on the album &quot;Ruff Ryders: Ryde or Die Vol. 2&quot;, on the track &quot;Twisted Heat&quot;. He also collaborated with Memphis Bleek on &quot;Is That Your Chick (The Lost Verses)&quot; on the album &quot;The Understanding&quot;.

Beginning in 2002, Twista began recording his album &quot;Kamikaze&quot; with rappers like Kanye West and Ludacris. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; was released in 2004 and debuted at the top spot of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. Its first single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; (also featured on West&#x27;s debut album &quot;The College Dropout&quot;), featured West and Jamie Foxx and became a number-one hit in the US. Other singles included &quot;Overnight Celebrity&quot; and &quot;So Sexy&quot; (featuring R. Kelly); the album sold around two million copies. The remix of the song &quot;Jook Gal&quot; by Elephant Man featured Twista and the YoungBloodZ. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; and its singles gave Twista a new level of success and rose his profile significantly within the rap community.
Twista&#x27;s album &quot;The Day After&quot; was released in 2005. It featured the hit singles &quot;Girl Tonite&quot; (featuring Trey Songz), &quot;Hit the Floor&quot; (featuring Pitbull), and &quot;So Lonely&quot; (featuring Mariah Carey). His next album, &quot;Adrenaline Rush 2007&quot;, was released in 2007. Also in 2007, Pitbull released the song &quot;Candyman&quot; featuring Twista off the album &quot;The Boatlift&quot;. Its singles were &quot;Give It Up&quot; (featuring Pharrell) and &quot;Creep Fast&quot; (featuring T-Pain). This album sold poorly compared to Twista&#x27;s earlier albums. Twista appeared on the single &quot;Hell No (Leave Home)&quot; from Monica&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;The Makings of Me&quot;. In 2008, Twista launched a new record label called Get Money Gang Entertainment and the album &quot;Category F5&quot; with the hit, &quot;Wetter&quot;. In 2009, Twista appeared on the single &quot;Legendary&quot; with fellow Chicago rappers AK-47 of Do or Die and Saurus and Bones.

Twista released his eighth solo album entitled, &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; on November 9, 2010. The first single from the album, &quot;Make a Movie&quot; produced by the Legendary Traxster, featuring Chris Brown, was released on August 24, 2010. Two buzz singles were released, &quot;I Do&quot; produced by Traxster and &quot;Heat&quot; produced by fellow Chicago producers No I.D. and the Legendary Traxster. The album features artists such as Waka Flocka Flame, Raekwon, Tia London, Diddy, Ray J, and others. Production on the album is mainly by the Legendary Traxster along with Streetrunner, the Kray Twinz, Tight Mike, and No I.D., Twista discussed his new documentary, directed by Vlad Yudin and the making of &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, including his belief that artists need to do more than just record songs and that they need to become more involved with the community around them.

A documentary film, &quot;Mr. Immortality: The Life and Times of Twista&quot;, was released in November 2010.

In January 2013, Twista was featured in a remix of Lil Reese&#x27;s song &quot;Traffic&quot;. As of 2013, Twista was working on his ninth studio album entitled &quot;Dark Horse&quot;. He also was rumored to be in the works of signing a record deal with Kanye West&#x27;s record label GOOD Music, although in an interview with &quot;HipHopDX&quot;, Twista denied the rumor. The first single was &quot;Throwin&#x27; My Money&quot; (featuring R. Kelly) and produced by Chris Millionaire. Twista appeared on the song &quot;Jewels n&#x27; Drugs&quot; by Lady Gaga on the album &quot;Artpop&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s Yours&quot; (featuring Tia London) was released on May 6, 2014, as the second single of the aforementioned album. It was serviced to urban contemporary radio in the United States on May 27, 2014, by Capitol Records. &quot;Dark Horse&quot; was released on August 12, 2014.

Twista is featured on the song &quot;Gossip&quot; from &quot;When Music Worlds Collide&quot; released in May 2015.

Twista appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in 2017.

Twista released the mixtape &quot;Summer 96&quot; in 2019, this includes the song &quot;Home Invasion&quot; which features Do or Die and produced by Hearon Tracks.

In 2019, Twista appeared as a judge on the rap competition series &quot;Rhythm + Flow&quot; on Netflix.

==Personal life==
Twista was married from 1991 to 1999 and had a daughter with his ex-wife.

During the holiday season in 2010, Twista and his team Get Money Gang worked together with Chicago Food Bank&#x27;s Producemobile program to feed hungry people in the community.

Twista is a gun enthusiast, has an Illinois Concealed Carry License, and is a US Concealed Carry Association (USCCA) and National Rifle Association of America (NRA) certified instructor. He teaches a course on concealed carry in Chicago, aiming to using education to combat gun violence.

<text>The British Rail Class 05 is a class of 0-6-0 diesel-mechanical shunters built by Hunslet Engine Company from 1955 to 1961. They were used on the Eastern and Scottish Regions of British Railways. The first two batches were delivered as 11136-11143 (later renumbered D2550-D2557) and 11161-11176 (later renumbered D2558-D2573). Subsequent locomotives were delivered, new, as D2574-D2618.

The British Rail Class D2/5 built by Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co. were reported in several sources as having received the TOPS class number 05, though this was in error, and they are not listed as such in the latest works by Marsden, 2011.

==Overview==

Most were withdrawn early (due to a surplus of shunting locomotives, resulting from the network cuts of the 1960s) and replaced by classes 03 and 04, with the exception of D2554, which was transferred to the Isle of Wight, in 1966, to aid the electrification of the Island Line. Owing to its apparent suitability for working on the island, it was retained in working order and given the TOPS number 05001. It was transferred to departmental stock in 1981, being given the number 97803, and remained in service until 1985, when it was withdrawn and sold to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway.

Didcot Railway Centre has a similar-looking industrial example numbered DL26, but it is not a BR class 05. It is one of a batch of four built by Hunslet in 1958 with a 264 hp National Gas engine and a higher bonnet line. DL26 and its sister DL25 worked in the NCB East Midlands area at Pleasley Pit, from where it was acquired for preservation. It is currently painted in original green livery but with an early BR emblem on the cab sides. It was the main shunter on the site until the arrival of a Class 08, and it still sees occasional use for shunting. It cannot be used on passenger trains due to its lack of vacuum brakes. The Isle of Wight Steam Railway&#x27;s own 05 001/D2554 can be seen frequently but it cannot run passenger trains, due to the Island&#x27;s unique vintage air braked rolling stock.

==Technical details==
The engine is a Gardner 8-cylinder, 4 stroke 8L3 of 204 hp (152 kW) connected to a Hunslet 4-speed gearbox through a Hunslet patent friction clutch. Final drive is via a Hunslet reversing gearbox and jackshaft.

== Preservation ==

Four class 05 locomotives have been preserved:
* D2554 &quot;Nuclear Fred&quot; at Isle of Wight Steam Railway. This engine has, at various times, carried the numbers 11140, 05001 and 97803
* D2578 &quot;Cider Queen&quot;, privately preserved by the D2578 Locomotive Group at Moreton Business Park, Herefordshire.
* D2587 by Heritage Shunters Trust
* D2595 at Ribble Steam Railway

== Models ==
Class 05 is being made as a ready-to-run model in OO gauge by Silver Fox Models, 4mm OO gauge by Heljan (August 2015) and in 7mm O gauge in September 2017.

<doc id="575620" wikidata="Q1393556" url="?curid=575620" title="Thiazolidinedione">
<text>The thiazolidinediones , abbreviated asTZD, also known as glitazones after the prototypical drug ciglitazone, are a class of heterocyclic compounds consisting of a five-membered C3NS ring. The term usually refers to a family of drugs used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 that were introduced in the late 1990s. As of 2024, there are two FDA-approved drugs in this class, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone.

== Mechanism of action ==
Thiazolidinediones or TZDs act by activating PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), a group of nuclear receptors, specific for &quot;PPARγ&quot; (PPAR-gamma, PPARG). They are thus the PPARG agonists subset of PPAR agonists. The endogenous ligands for these receptors are free fatty acids (FFAs) and eicosanoids. When activated, the receptor binds to DNA in complex with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), another nuclear receptor, increasing transcription of a number of specific genes and decreasing transcription of others. The main effect of expression and repression of specific genes is an increase in the storage of fatty acids in adipocytes, thereby decreasing the amount of fatty acids present in circulation. As a result, cells become more dependent on the oxidation of carbohydrates, more specifically glucose, in order to yield energy for other cellular processes.

===PPARγ transactivation===

The activated PPAR/RXR heterodimer binds to peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements upstream of target genes in complex with a number of coactivators such as nuclear receptor coactivator 1 and CREB binding protein, this causes upregulation of genes (for a full list see PPARγ):
* Insulin resistance is decreased
* Adipocyte differentiation is modified
* VEGF-induced angiogenesis is inhibited
* Leptin levels decrease (leading to an increased appetite)
* Levels of certain interleukins (e.g. IL-6) fall
* Antiproliferative action
* Adiponectin levels rise

TZDs also increase the synthesis of certain proteins involved in fat and glucose metabolism, which reduces levels of certain types of lipids, and circulating free fatty acids. TZDs generally decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Although the increase in LDL-C may be more focused on the larger LDL particles, which may be less atherogenic, the clinical significance of this is currently unknown. Nonetheless, rosiglitazone, a certain glitazone, was suspended from allowed use by medical authorities in Europe, as it has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

===PPARγ transrepression===

Binding of PPARγ to coactivators appears to reduce the levels of coactivators available for binding to pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as NF-κB; this causes a decrease in transcription of a number of pro inflammatory genes, including various interleukins and tumour necrosis factors.

== Members of the class ==

Chemically, the members of this class are derivatives of the parent compound thiazolidinedione, and include:
* Pioglitazone (Actos), France and Germany have suspended its sale after a study suggested the drug could raise the risk of bladder cancer.
* Rosiglitazone (Avandia), which was put under selling restrictions in the US and withdrawn from the market in Europe due to some studies suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Upon re-evaluation of new data in 2013, the FDA lifted the restrictions. 
* Lobeglitazone (Duvie), approved for use in Korea

Experimental, failed and non-marketed agents include:
* Azemiglitazone
* Ciglitazone
* Darglitazone
* Englitazone
* Netoglitazone

Replacing one oxygen atom in a thiazolidinedione with an atom of sulfur gives a rhodanine.

== Uses ==
The only approved use of the thiazolidinediones is in diabetes mellitus type 2. According to a 2014 Cochrane systematic review of four randomized controlled trials, PPARγ-agonists may be effective in preventing further strokes in those who have already had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) and may stabilize atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries.

==Research==
Experimental investigations on TZDs have been carried out since 2005 in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), psoriasis, autism, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (by VEGF inhibition in granulosa cells), lichen planopilaris, and other conditions.

Several forms of lipodystrophy cause insulin resistance, which has responded favorably to thiazolidinediones. There are some indications that thiazolidinediones provide some degree of protection against the initial stages of breast carcinoma development.

Evidence was emerging in 2008 that vitamin E with thiazolidinediones is effective in the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis due to their combined antioxidant and insulin sensitizing effects, producing histological improvements in steatosis severity.

Thiazolindinediones induce adipogenesis in subcutaneous fat deposits by activating PPARγ receptors. This effect has been used in transgender patients to shift body fat distribution towards a more gynoid pattern.

== Side effects and contraindications ==
The withdrawal of troglitazone has led to concerns of the other thiazolidinediones also increasing the incidence of hepatitis and potential liver failure, an approximately 1 in 20,000 individual occurrence with troglitazone. Because of this, the FDA recommends two to three month checks of liver enzymes for the first year of thiazolidinedione therapy to check for this rare but potentially catastrophic complication. To date, 2008, the newer thiazolidinediones, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone have been free of this problem.

The main side effect of all thiazolidinediones is water retention, leading to edema, generally a problem in less than 5% of individuals, but a big problem for some and potentially, with significant water retention, leading to a decompensation of potentially previously unrecognized heart failure. Therefore, thiazolidinediones should be prescribed with both caution and patient warnings about the potential for water retention/weight gain, especially in patients with decreased ventricular function (NYHA grade III or IV heart failure).

Though older studies suggested there may be an increased risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks with rosiglitazone, pioglitazone treatment, in contrast, has shown significant protection from both micro- and macro-vascular cardiovascular events and plaque progression. These studies led to a period of Food and Drug Administration advisories (2007 – 2013) that, aided by extensive media coverage, led to a substantial decrease in rosiglitazone use. In November 2013, the FDA announced it would remove the usage restrictions for rosiglitazone in patients with coronary artery disease. The new recommendations were largely based on the reasoning that prior meta-analyses leading to the original restrictions were not designed to assess cardiac outcomes and, thus, not uniformly collected or adjudicated. In contrast, one of the largest trials (RECORD trial) that was specifically designed to assess cardiac outcomes found no increased risk of myocardial infarction with rosiglitazone use, even after independent re-evaluation for FDA review.

A 2013 meta-analysis concluded that use of pioglitazone is associated with a slightly higher risk of bladder cancer compared to the general population. The authors of the same analysis recommended that other blood sugar lowering agents be considered in people with other risk factors for bladder cancer such as cigarette smoking, family history, or exposure to certain forms of chemotherapy.

A 2020 Cochrane systematic review did not find enough evidence of reduction of all-cause mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or end-stage renal disease when comparing metformin monotherapy to Thiazolidinedione for treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Thiazolidinediones reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures in women, possibly as a result of biasing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells away from osteoblast differentiation and toward adipocyte formation.

<text>The State Anthem of the Ukrainian SSR was the Soviet republican anthem of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union.

It has been banned in Ukraine since 2015 due to decommunization laws.

==Background==
The Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic had instituted &quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy i slava, i volia&quot; as its anthem in 1917. It was banned when the Russian and Ukrainian Bolsheviks took control of Ukraine in 1920 and created the USSR in 1922. But they did not see any need for a Ukrainian anthem until the 1940s.

The idea of creating the anthem arose in context with introduction of the Ukrainian SSR to the United Nations organization, the creation of which was discussed at the 1943 Teheran Conference. In order to receive extra votes in the United Nations, Stalin came up with the idea to add two union republics – Ukraine and Belarus – which had to be portrayed as fully sovereign republics. In relation to that about a month later on 28 January – 1 February 1944 in Moscow was convened the 10th session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union which adapted laws about creation of key people&#x27;s commissariats (ministries) in union republics such as defense and foreign affairs. Already on 3 February 1944 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued its Ukase &quot;About state anthems of Soviet republics&quot;, according to which all union republics were obligated to adopt own anthems.

In spring of 1944 in Kiev was established a commission in preparation of anthem draft, which was headed by director of the Agitation and Propaganda section of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine Konstantin Litvin. The Ukrainian poets who participated in contest were given quite responsible and &quot;delicate&quot; task to create such &quot;main song of Ukraine&quot; that in all and completely would &quot;fit&quot; into the politically ideological context of the All-Union anthem (&quot;State Anthem of the Soviet Union&quot;) and at the same time reflect the Ukrainian national characteristics.

The leitmotif or motto-theme of practically all variants of the Ukrainian anthem lyrics submitted at the contest became glorification of the &quot;older brother – the Great Russian people&quot; and the &quot;leader of all nations Joseph Stalin&quot;. Among such variants were examples that began with the following leading lines:
* &quot;In fraternal unity of Slavic nations our first brother is the people of Russia&quot;
* &quot;Russia is our freedom and glory that united our nation and our land bloomed&quot;
* &quot;Be glorious in the heart of Ukraine, the great friend, our Russian brother&quot;

The authors were offering to implement into the anthem lines that would call Ukrainians &quot;to live under the sun of the Kremlin and Moscow&quot;, &quot;follow the freedom road under the stars of friendship, the stars of Moscow&quot;, to glorify &quot;in the heart of Ukraine, the great friend, our Russian brother&quot; and so on. In regards to Joseph Stalin, the creative fantasy of anthem writers had no limits indeed. Stalin was named as the Sun, the Dawn, the Father of Ukraine (e.g. &quot;Two suns you have one in the Kremlin, another burns in the blue sky&quot;). There were numerous versions that were submitted, but never adopted during the still ongoing war. Finally in 1949 due to certain awkwardness in the United Nations, there arose the issue to make changes to the Ukrainian state symbols, so there was finally adopted the new State Emblem and State Flag of the Ukrainian SSR.

The authors of lyrics of the State Anthem of the Ukrainian SSR became prominent Soviet Ukrainian poets Pavlo Tychyna and Mykola Bazhan, while the music was written by a creative team led by Soviet composer Anton Lebedynets. The text body of the &quot;main Ukrainian patriotic song&quot;, completely &quot;fitted&quot; into the ideological context of the All-Union anthem by glorifying the Soviet Union, in which the united Ukraine &quot;found its happiness&quot;, &quot;as a flower has blossomed&quot;, the Russian people who &quot;in struggle for the fate of our nation was always our friend and brother&quot;, as well as the leaders like Lenin who &quot;illuminated us the path to freedom&quot; and Stalin who &quot;leads us to the illustrious heights&quot;.

When Stalin died in 1953, during the process of de-Stalinization, the State Anthems were muted by Nikita Khrushchev along with the Ukrainian SSR. In 1977, the Soviet Union adopted a new constitution and lyrics of the National Anthem, all its Socialist Republics followed the same path.

The fact that in the Soviet Ukrainian anthem the manifestation of national patriotic sentiments was transmitted through demonstration of loyalty to another nation undoubtedly could be considered the most fascinating paradox of the Soviet Ukrainian authorship of anthem. However that paradox was completely natural as the anthem of the UkrSSR was a real visiting card of the Ukrainian Soviet puppet statehood. Such it remained and after the implemented respective corrections in it in 1958 following the All-Union parenting model.

The music was composed by Anton Dmytrovych Lebedynets, and the words were written by Pavlo Tychyna. In 1958, the second stanza of the lyrics was changed by Mykola Bazhan to remove mentions of Joseph Stalin; the new third stanza omitted reference to the “people’s sword of righteous anger” and added a new reference to “Lenin’s party” (the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) while retaining the one to communism itself. The anthem of the USSR was also played during nearly all official events in Ukraine.

On 15 January 1992, the Presidium of Verkhovna Rada issue its ukase stating that the Anthem of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic loses its status and starting with 16 January 1992 it is replaced with the earlier anthem &quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukrainy i slava, i volia&quot;.

In 2002 there was an attempt to reintroduce the Ukrainian Soviet anthem with a changed text edited by Mykhailo Tush. Previously, the Soviet anthems were already revived in the Russian Federation and Belarus. Another attempt took place in 2010, in which the Luhansk wing of the Communist Party of Ukraine held a competition for new lyrics, which was won by Igor Ortsev from Luhansk.

Since 2015, performance of this song is prohibited in Ukraine and offenders may be subject to up to five years of imprisonment for &quot;Propaganda of the Soviet totalitarian symbols&quot;. It is used, like other pieces of nostalgia to the Soviet Union, by collaborators in Russian-held areas in southeastern parts of the country.

<text>Pikey (; also spelled pikie, pykie) is an ethnic slur referring to Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people. It is used mainly in the United Kingdom and in Ireland to refer to people who belong to groups which had a traditional travelling lifestyle. Groups referred to with this term include Irish Travellers, English Gypsies, Welsh Kale, Scottish Lowland Travellers, Scottish Highland Travellers, and Funfair Travellers. These groups consider the term to be extremely offensive.

It is used by extension as a classist insult against marginalised working class communities, similar to the term chav.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;pikey&quot; is possibly derived from &quot;pike&quot; which, c. 1520, meant &quot;highway&quot; and is related to the words &quot;turnpike&quot; (toll road) and &quot;pikeman&quot; (toll collector). In Robert Henryson&#x27;s Fable Collection (late 15th century), in the fable of the Two Mice, the thieving mice are referred to on more than one occasion as &quot;pykeris&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;And in the samin thay went, but mair abaid,&quot;
&quot;Withoutin fyre or candill birnand bricht&quot;
&quot;For commonly sic pykeris luffis not lycht.&quot;

And together they went, but more about, 
without fire or candle burning bright
For commonly, such thieves do not like light.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==19th century and 20th century==
Charles Dickens in 1837 writes disparagingly of itinerant &quot;pike-keepers&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traced the earliest use of &quot;pikey&quot; to &quot;The Times&quot; in August 1838, which referred to strangers who had come to the Isle of Sheppey as &quot;pikey-men&quot;. In 1847, J. O. Halliwell in his &quot;Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words&quot; recorded the use of &quot;pikey&quot; to mean a gypsy. In 1887, W. D. Parish and W. F. Shaw in the &quot;Dictionary of Kentish Dialect&quot; recorded the use of the word to mean &quot;a turnpike traveller; a vagabond; and so generally a low fellow&quot;.

Thomas Acton&#x27;s &quot;Gypsy Politics and Social Change&quot; notes John Camden Hotten&#x27;s &quot;Slang Dictionary&quot; (1887) as similarly stating:

Hotten&#x27;s dictionary of slang gives &quot;pike at&quot; as &quot;go away&quot; and &quot;Pikey&quot; as &quot;a tramp or a Gypsy&quot;. He continues a &quot;pikey-cart&quot; is, in various parts of the country, one of those habitable vehicles suggestive of country life. Possibly the term has some reference to those who continually use the &quot;pike&quot; or turnpike road.

The &quot;Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society&quot; similarly agrees the term &quot;pikey&quot; solely applied (negatively) to Romani people.

==Contemporary usage==
&quot;Pikey&quot; remained, as of 1989, common prison slang for Romani people or those who have a similar lifestyle of itinerant unemployment and travel. More recently, &quot;pikey&quot; was applied to Irish Travellers (other slurs include &quot;tinkers&quot; and &quot;knackers&quot;) and non-Romanichal . In the late 20th century, it came to be used to describe &quot;a lower-class person, regarded as coarse or disreputable&quot;.

The most common contemporary use of &quot;pikey&quot; is not as a term for the Romani ethnic group, but as a catch-all phrase to refer to people, of any ethnic group, who travel around with no fixed abode. Among English Romani Gypsies the term pikey refers to a Traveller who is not of Romani descent. It may also refer to a member who has been cast out of the family.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the definition became even looser and is sometimes used to refer to a wide section of the (generally urban) underclass of the country (in England generally known as chavs), or merely a person of any social class who &quot;lives on the cheap&quot; such as a bohemian. It is also used as an adjective, e.g. &quot;a pikey estate&quot; or &quot;a pikey pub&quot;. Following complaints from Travellers&#x27; groups about racism, when the term was used by presenter Jeremy Clarkson as a pun for Pike&#x27;s Peak in the television programme &quot;Top Gear&quot;, the Editorial Standards Committee of the BBC Trust ruled that, in this instance, the term merely meant &quot;cheap&quot;. In doing so, it justified the ascribed meaning by quoting the Wikipedia article for the term.

In 2003 the Firle Bonfire Society burned an effigy of a family of gypsies inside a caravan after travellers damaged local land. The number plate on the caravan read &quot;P1KEY&quot;. A storm of protests and accusations of racism rapidly followed. Twelve members of the society were arrested but the Crown Prosecution Service decided that there was insufficient evidence to proceed on a charge of &quot;incitement to racial hatred&quot;.

<text>Casting out nines is any of three arithmetical procedures:
*Adding the decimal digits of a positive whole number, while optionally ignoring any 9s or digits which sum to 9 or a multiple of 9. The result of this procedure is a number which is smaller than the original whenever the original has more than one digit, leaves the same remainder as the original after division by nine, and may be obtained from the original by subtracting a multiple of 9 from it. The name of the procedure derives from this latter property.
*Repeated application of this procedure to the results obtained from previous applications until a single-digit number is obtained. This single-digit number is called the &quot;digital root&quot; of the original. If a number is divisible by 9, its digital root is 9. Otherwise, its digital root is the remainder it leaves after being divided by 9.
*A sanity test in which the above-mentioned procedures are used to check for errors in arithmetical calculations. The test is carried out by applying the same sequence of arithmetical operations to the digital roots of the operands as are applied to the operands themselves. If no mistakes are made in the calculations, the digital roots of the two resultants will be the same. If they are different, therefore, one or more mistakes must have been made in the calculations.

==Digit sums==
To &quot;cast out nines&quot; from a single number, its decimal digits can be simply added together to obtain its so-called digit sum. The digit sum of 2946, for example is 2 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 21. Since 21 = 2946 − 325 × 9, the effect of taking the digit sum of 2946 is to &quot;cast out&quot; 325 lots of 9 from it. If the digit 9 is ignored when summing the digits, the effect is to &quot;cast out&quot; one more 9 to give the result 12.

More generally, when casting out nines by summing digits, any set of digits which add up to 9, or a multiple of 9, can be ignored. In the number 3264, for example, the digits 3 and 6 sum to 9. Ignoring these two digits, therefore, and summing the other two, we get 2 + 4 = 6. Since 6 = 3264 − 362 × 9, this computation has resulted in casting out 362 lots of 9 from 3264.

For an arbitrary number, formula_1, normally represented by the sequence of decimal digits, formula_2, the digit sum is formula_3. The difference between the original number and its digit sum is

: formula_4

Because numbers of the form formula_5 are always divisible by 9 (since formula_6), replacing the original number by its digit sum has the effect of casting out

: formula_7

lots of 9.

==Digital roots==

If the procedure described in the preceding paragraph is repeatedly applied to the result of each previous application, the eventual result will be a single-digit number from which &quot;all&quot; 9s, with the possible exception of one, have been &quot;cast out&quot;. The resulting single-digit number is called the &quot;digital root&quot; of the original. The exception occurs when the original number has a digital root of 9, whose digit sum is itself, and therefore will not be cast out by taking further digit sums.

The number 12565, for instance, has digit sum 1+2+5+6+5 = 19, which, in turn, has digit sum 1+9=10, which, in its turn has digit sum 1+0=1, a single-digit number. The digital root of 12565 is therefore 1, and its computation has the effect of casting out (12565 - 1)/9 = 1396 lots of 9 from 12565.

==Checking calculations by casting out nines==

To check the result of an arithmetical calculation by casting out nines, each number in the calculation is replaced by its digital root and the same calculations applied to these digital roots. The digital root of the result of this calculation is then compared with that of the result of the original calculation. If no mistake has been made in the calculations, these two digital roots must be the same. Examples in which casting-out-nines has been used to check addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are given below.

==Examples==
===Addition===
In each addend, cross out all 9s and pairs of digits that total 9, then add together what remains. These new values are called &quot;excesses&quot;. Add up leftover digits for each addend until one digit is reached. Now process the sum and also the excesses to get a &quot;final&quot; excess.
===Subtraction===
===Multiplication===
*8 times 8 is 64; 6 and 4 are 10; 1 and 0 are 1.

===Division===
==How it works==

The method works because the original numbers are &#x27;decimal&#x27; (base 10), the modulus is chosen to differ by 1, and casting out is equivalent to taking a digit sum. In general any two &#x27;large&#x27; integers, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, expressed in any smaller &quot;modulus&quot; as &quot;x&quot;&#x27; and &quot;y&#x27; &quot; (for example, modulo 7) will always have the same sum, difference or product as their originals. This property is also preserved for the &#x27;digit sum&#x27; where the base and the modulus differ by 1.

If a calculation was correct before casting out, casting out on both sides will preserve correctness. However, it is possible that two previously unequal integers will be identical modulo 9 (on average, a ninth of the time).

The operation does not work on fractions, since a given fractional number does not have a unique representation.

== A variation on the explanation ==

A trick to learn to add with nines is to add ten to the digit and to count back one. Since we are adding 1 to the tens digit and subtracting one from the units digit, the sum of the digits should remain the same. For example, 9 + 2 = 11 with 1 + 1 = 2. When adding 9 to itself, we would thus expect the sum of the digits to be 9 as follows: 9 + 9 = 18, (1 + 8 = 9) and 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, (2 + 7 = 9). Let us look at a simple multiplication: 5 × 7 = 35, (3 + 5 = 8). Now consider (7 + 9) × 5 = 16 × 5 = 80, (8 + 0 = 8) or 7 × (9 + 5) = 7 × 14 = 98, (9 + 8 = 17), (1 + 7 = 8).

Any non-negative integer can be written as 9×n + a, where &#x27;a&#x27; is a single digit from 0 to 8, and &#x27;n&#x27; is some non-negative integer.
Thus, using the distributive rule, (9×n + a)×(9×m + b)= 9×9×n×m + 9(am + bn) + ab. Since the first two factors are multiplied by 9, their sums will end up being 9 or 0, leaving us with &#x27;ab&#x27;. In our example, &#x27;a&#x27; was 7 and &#x27;b&#x27; was 5. We would expect that in any base system, the number before that base would behave just like the nine.

== Limitation to casting out nines ==

While extremely useful, casting out nines does not catch all errors made while doing calculations. For example, the casting-out-nines method would not recognize the error in a calculation of 5 × 7 which produced any of the erroneous results 8, 17, 26, etc. (that is, any result congruent to 8 modulo 9). In particular, casting out nines does not catch transposition errors, such as 1324 instead of 1234. In other words, the method only catches erroneous results whose digital root is one of the 8 digits that is different from that of the correct result.

==History==
A form of casting out nines known to ancient Greek mathematicians was described by the Roman bishop Hippolytus (170–235) in &quot;The Refutation of all Heresies&quot;, and more briefly by the Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus (c.245–c.325) in his commentary on the &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; of Nicomachus of Gerasa. Both Hippolytus&#x27;s and Iamblichus&#x27;s descriptions, though, were limited to an explanation of how repeated digital sums of Greek numerals were used to compute a unique &quot;root&quot; between 1 and 9. Neither of them displayed any awareness of how the procedure could be used to check the results of arithmetical computations.

The earliest known surviving work which describes how casting out nines can be used to check the results of arithmetical computations is the &quot;Mahâsiddhânta&quot;, written around 950 by the Indian mathematician and astronomer Aryabhata II (c.920–c.1000).
Writing about 1020, the Persian polymath, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (c.980–1037), also gave full details of what he called the &quot;Hindu method&quot; of checking arithmetical calculations by casting out nines.

The procedure was described by Fibonacci in his &quot;Liber Abaci&quot;.

==Generalization==
This method can be generalized to determine the remainders of division by certain prime numbers.

Since 3·3 = 9,
: formula_8
So we can use the remainder from casting out nines to get the remainder of division by three.

Casting out ninety nines is done by adding groups of two digits instead just one digit.

Since 11·9 = 99,
: formula_9
So we can use the remainder from casting out ninety nines to get the remainder of division by eleven. This is called casting out elevens. The same result can also be calculated directly by alternately adding and subtracting the digits that make up formula_10. Eleven divides formula_10 if and only if eleven divides that sum.

Casting out nine hundred ninety nines is done by adding groups of three digits.

Since 37·27 = 999,
: formula_12
So we can use the remainder from casting out nine hundred ninety nines to get the remainder of division by thirty seven.

<text>The State Anthem of Uzbekistan was officially adopted on 10 December 1991 by the Constitution of Uzbekistan, after gaining independence from the Soviet Union. The lyrics were written by Uzbek poet Abdulla Oripov, set to the melody composed by Soviet Uzbek composer Mutal Burhonov.

==History==
The State Anthem of Uzbekistan was officially approved on 10 December 1992 under Law &quot;On the National Anthem of the Republic of Uzbekistan&quot; by the Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Uzbekistan. Previously, there had been many attempts at creating a national anthem with new lyrics for Uzbekistan upon independence from the Soviet Union; the version written by well-known composer Abdulla Oripov was officially chosen in completion of the new national anthem. Oripov&#x27;s words were set to the tune composed by Soviet Uzbek composer Mutal Burhonov in 1947; the melody is identical to that of the Anthem of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic with no subsequent changes. Uzbekistan is one of the four post-Soviet states – alongside Belarus, Russia, and Tajikistan – that continue to use the Soviet-era tune for their current anthems.

The National Symphony Orchestra of Uzbekistan is officially considered the first performer of Uzbekistan&#x27;s national anthem. In July 2006, the anthem was re-recorded for performance at state events, on radio and television.

On 10 December 2019, 28 years after the official establishment of the national anthem, Uzbek writer Oraz Abdurazakov translated the lyrics of the anthem into Russian. In his speech on 14 April 2020, dedicated to measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Uzbekistan, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev quoted a part of Oraz Abdurazakov&#x27;s translation: &quot;The National Anthem contains such profound lines: &#x27;The power of ancestors, their glory is forever with you! The spirit of great people is rightfully given to us.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Galatea is an interactive fiction video game by Emily Short featuring a modern rendition of the Greek myth of Galatea, the sculpture of a woman that gained life. It took &quot;Best of Show&quot; in the 2000 IF Art Show and won a XYZZY Award for Best Non-Player Character. The game displays an unusually rich approach to non-player character dialogue and diverts from the typical puzzle-solving in interactive fiction: gameplay consists entirely of interacting with a single character in a single room.

&quot;Galatea&quot; is licensed under the Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 3.0 US license.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Galatea&quot; alters the typical interactive fiction game mechanics by concentrating instead on the player&#x27;s interactions with a single non-player character (NPC), the eponymous Galatea. Much of the interest of the piece derives from the ambiguous nature of the player–NPC dialogue: the form of the conversation and, indeed, the nature of Galatea herself shift depending on the focus the player places on certain aspects of the character&#x27;s personality. Numerous endings are possible. Gameplay centers around the developing dialogue between Galatea and the player when asking about topics in the previous conversation. Two commands, &quot;think about&quot; and &quot;recap&quot;, are provided to keep track of what has already been said; the former is also used to advance the storyline, as the player character draws conclusions about the story as it has unfolded to that point. The game also encourages using sensory commands (&quot;touch&quot;, &quot;listen to&quot;, &quot;look at&quot;), adding immersion to the experience.

==Plot==
&quot;Galatea&quot; is loosely based on the myth of Pygmalion, who carved the sculpture of a woman. In the myth, he falls in love with the statue, named Galatea or Elise in different versions, and the goddess Venus brings her to life.

The story begins at the opening of an exhibition of artificial intelligences. The player, alone, discovers Galatea displayed on a pedestal with a small information placard. She is illuminated by a spotlight and wears an emerald dress. Seeing the player about to turn away, Galatea says, &quot;They told me you were coming.&quot; From this point, the story may proceed in a number of ways depending on the player&#x27;s words and actions.

===Multilinear interactive fiction===

Short describes this as &quot;multilinear interactive fiction&quot;: while interactive fiction in general allows the player to find their own way through the story, this leads in most cases to a single ending (or at least a single desired &#x27;correct&#x27; ending). With &quot;Galatea&quot;, Short presents a story with around 70 different endings and hundreds of possible ways of reaching them.

The plot is thus designed to appear open-ended with the development of the story entirely dependent on what the player decides to talk or ask about or what actions they choose to perform. Thus the original author and the player share in the creation of a work of fiction.

==Development==
In interviews, Emily Short has explained that &quot;Galatea&quot; arose out of her efforts to develop advanced dialog coding for interactive fiction engines. Although code for simple conversational programs like &quot;ELIZA&quot; have existed since the 1960s, and limited dialog options have existed in interactive fiction since the 1970s, Short&#x27;s efforts to develop chatterbot-like dialog required her to produce a simple test case scenario to test NPC interaction. Thus the single-room, single-occupant &quot;Galatea&quot; was a natural result.

Development of the game progressed organically with Short engaging in test runs and drafting new dialog options for every conversational dead-end that arose. The game&#x27;s multiple endings also arose in a similar fashion although Short had intended that there be multiple endings from the start. Although the nature of the game&#x27;s development as well as its minimalist final form has led to questions regarding whether it is really a game and not just an experimental conversational program, Short has suggested that to her the definition of interactive fiction requires nothing more than a world model and a parser, and &quot;anything you can cook up with those features counts as IF.&quot; Short has acknowledged the helpful influence of the close-knit IF community and the &quot;atmosphere in which experimentation is valued&quot; as leading to the success of her works like &quot;Galatea&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Galatea&quot; was well received, achieving critical acclaim from interactive fiction reviewers. The game is considered to aspire to a new level of art in interactive fiction, and thereby to have revolutionized the genre, establishing its author, Emily Short, as one of the key figures in the modern interactive fiction scene. Fellow award-winning IF author, Adam Cadre has called Galatea &quot;the best NPC ever&quot;—a view that was echoed by Joystiq&#x27;s John Bardinelli. Cadre also describes the game as an example of an alternative kind of puzzle where &quot;interactivity comes in deciding where to go, what to see, what to say. Rather than having to open gates along a path, you discover that they&#x27;re all open at first, but stepping through one causes others to close.&quot;

&quot;Galatea&quot; was described in 2007 by Indiegames.com as a &quot;fascinating journey.&quot; In a 2009 article, Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the depth and detail of the game, the complexities of the character design and its &quot;masterful balance between intricacy and simplicity&quot;, and &quot;Galatea&#x27;s emotional turmoil&quot; that is &quot;encoded sweetly into the subtext of what&#x27;s going on. By simply interacting in a logical manner, you learn more about this character than any cut-scene or info-dump could ever hope to convey.&quot; This was reiterated in a 2010 1UP.com article that listed Galatea as #2 in its &quot;Top 5 Introductory Interactive Fiction Games&quot; feature, describing it as intriguingly replayable, and as a &quot;surprisingly rich game for its apparent minimalism&quot;. In 2011, PC Gamer highlighted &quot;Galatea&quot; as an example of the artistic and literary aspects of the interactive fiction genre.

The titular character, Galatea, has been compared to the 2007 &quot;Portal&quot; character GLaDOS due to similarities in the personalities of the characters.

<text>Chang&#x27;e 1 (; ) was an uncrewed Chinese lunar-orbiting spacecraft, part of the first phase of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program. The spacecraft was named after the Chinese Moon goddess, Chang&#x27;e.

Chang&#x27;e 1 was launched on 24 October 2007 at 10:05:04 UTC from Xichang Satellite Launch Center. It left lunar transfer orbit on 31 October and entered lunar orbit on 5 November.
The first picture of the Moon was relayed on 26 November 2007. On 12 November 2008, a map of the entire lunar surface was released, produced from data collected by Chang&#x27;e 1 between November 2007 and July 2008.

The mission was scheduled to continue for a year, but was later extended and the spacecraft operated until 1 March 2009, when it was taken out of orbit. It impacted the surface of the Moon at 08:13 UTC. Data gathered by Chang&#x27;e 1 was used to create an accurate and high resolution 3-D map of the lunar surface. Chang&#x27;e 1 was the first lunar probe to conduct passive, multi-channel, microwave remote sensing of the Moon by using a microwave radiometer.

Its sister orbital probe Chang&#x27;e 2 was launched on 1 October 2010.

== Overview ==

The Chinese Lunar Exploration Program is designed to be conducted in four phases of incremental technological advancement: The first is simply reaching lunar orbit, a task completed by Chang&#x27;e 1 in 2007 and Chang&#x27;e 2 in 2010. The second is landing and roving on the Moon, as Chang&#x27;e 3 did in 2013 and Chang&#x27;e 4 did in 2019. The third is collecting lunar samples from the near-side and sending them to Earth, a task for the Chang&#x27;e 5 and Chang&#x27;e 6 missions. The fourth phase consists of development of a robotic research station near the Moon&#x27;s south pole. The program aims to facilitate a crewed lunar landing in the 2030s and to possibly build an outpost near the south pole.

== Objectives ==
The Chang&#x27;e 1 mission had four major goals:

# Obtaining three-dimensional images of the landforms and geological structures of the lunar surface, so as to provide a reference for planned future soft landings. The orbit of Chang&#x27;e 1 around the Moon was designed to provide complete coverage, including areas near the north and south poles not covered by previous missions.
# Analysing and mapping the abundance and distribution of various chemical elements on the lunar surface as part of an evaluation of potentially useful resources on the Moon. China hopes to extend the number of elements studied to 14 (potassium (K), thorium (Th), uranium (U), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), tellurium (Te), titanium (Ti), sodium (Na), manganese (Mn), chromium (Cr), and lanthanum (La)), compared with the 10 elements (K, U, Th, Fe (iron), Ti, O, Si, Al, Mg, and Ca) previously probed by NASA&#x27;s Lunar Prospector.
# Probing the features of the lunar soil and assessing its depth, as well as the amount of helium-3 (³He) present.
# Probing the space environment between 40,000 km. (24854.8 mi) and 400,000 km (248548.5 mi) from the Earth, recording data on the solar wind and studying the impact of solar activity on the Earth and the Moon.

In addition, the lunar probe engineering system, composed of five major systems – the satellite system, the launch vehicle system, the launch site system, the monitoring and control system and the ground application system – accomplished five goals:

* Researching, developing and launching China&#x27;s first lunar probe
* Mastering the basic technology of placing satellites in lunar orbit
* Conducting China&#x27;s first scientific exploration of the Moon
* Initially forming a lunar probe space engineering system
* Accumulating experience for the later phases of China&#x27;s lunar exploration program

== Mission ==

According to the schedule, detailed design of the first program milestone was completed by September 2004. Research and development of a prototype probe and relevant testing of the probe were finished before the end of 2005. Design, manufacture, general assembly, test and ground experiments of the lunar orbiter were finished before December 2006.

Originally scheduled for April 2007, the launch was postponed until October as this was &quot;a better time for sending a satellite into the Moon&#x27;s orbit&quot;. Chang&#x27;e 1 was launched by a Long March 3A rocket at 10:05 GMT on October 24, 2007, from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province.

After liftoff, Chang&#x27;e 1 made three orbits around the Earth, a burn at perigee extending the orbit&#x27;s apogee further each time, until a final translunar injection burn placed it on course for the Moon on October 31, 2007. Another burn placed it in a polar orbit around the Moon, with burns at the periselenium of the first three orbits decreasing the aposelenium until it entered a final circular orbit. Lunar orbit insertion was achieved on the November 5, 2007. To mark this occasion, the probe transmitted 30 classical Chinese songs and musical pieces, including &quot;My Motherland&quot;, &quot;The Song of the Yangtze River&quot;, and &quot;High Mountains and Flowing Water&quot;.

The probe was remotely controlled from stations at Qingdao and Kashgar, as the first use of the Chinese Deep Space Network. The ESA Maspalomas Tracking Station was also used to transmit signals to and from the probe.

The first pictures of the Moon were relayed on November 26, 2007. The probe was designed to orbit the Moon for one year, but operations were later extended, and it remained in lunar orbit until March 1, 2009.

==End of mission==
On 1 March 2009, at 08:13:10 UTC, Chang&#x27;e 1 crashed onto the surface of the Moon, ending its mission. According to the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (China), this was a planned and controlled impact. Impact point was . During its orbital mission the probe transmitted 1,400 gigabits or 175 gigabytes (GB) of data.

== Design and instrumentation ==

The Chang&#x27;e 1 spacecraft had a mass of , with a payload, carrying 24 instruments including a charge-coupled device (CCD) stereo camera, microprobe instruments, and a high-energy solar particle detector.

* Stereo camera with an optical resolution of and spectrometer imager operating at wavelengths of

<doc id="575668" wikidata="Q579794" url="?curid=575668" title="Beyond Good and Evil">
<text>Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future () is a book by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche that covers ideas in his previous work &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; but with a more polemical approach. It was first published in 1886 under the publishing house C. G. Naumann of Leipzig at the author&#x27;s own expense and first translated into English by Helen Zimmern, who was two years younger than Nietzsche and knew the author.

According to translator Walter Kaufman, the title refers to the need for moral philosophy to go beyond simplistic black and white moralizing, as contained in statements such as &quot;X is good&quot; or &quot;X is evil&quot;. At the beginning of the book (§ 2), Nietzsche attacks the very idea of using strictly opposite terms such as &quot;Good versus Evil&quot;.

In &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, Nietzsche accuses past philosophers of lacking critical sense and blindly accepting dogmatic premises in their consideration of morality. Specifically, he accuses them of founding grand metaphysical systems upon the faith that the good man is the opposite of the evil man, rather than just a different expression of the same basic impulses that find more direct expression in the evil man. The work moves into the realm &quot;beyond good and evil&quot; in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual.

The book is well-known for the often-quoted line: &quot;He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.&quot; 

== Background and themes ==
Of the four &quot;late-period&quot; writings of Nietzsche, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; most closely resembles the aphoristic style of his middle period. In it he exposes the deficiencies of those usually called &quot;philosophers&quot; and identifies the qualities of the &quot;new philosophers&quot;: imagination, self-assertion, danger, originality, and the &quot;creation of values&quot;. He then contests some of the key presuppositions of the old philosophic tradition like &quot;self-consciousness&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, and &quot;free will&quot;, explaining them as inventions of the moral consciousness. In their place, he offers the &quot;will to power&quot; as an explanation of all behavior; this ties into his &quot;perspective of life&quot;, which he regards as &quot;beyond good and evil&quot;, denying a universal morality for all human beings. Religion and the master and slave moralities feature prominently as Nietzsche re-evaluates deeply held humanistic beliefs, portraying even domination, appropriation and injury to the weak as not universally objectionable.

In several places of the book, Nietzsche drops hints, and even explicit statements as to what the philosophies of the future must deal with.

== Structure of the work ==
The work consists of a short preface dated to 1885, 296 numbered sections, and an &quot;epode&quot; (or &quot;aftersong&quot;) entitled &quot;From High Mountains&quot;. Not counting the preface or epode, the main sections are organized into nine parts:

* Part One: On the Prejudices of Philosophers
* Part Two: The Free Spirit
* Part Three: The Religious Mood
* Part Four: Apophthegms and Interludes
* Part Five: The Natural History of Morals
* Part Six: We Scholars
* Part Seven: Our Virtues
* Part Eight: Peoples and Countries
* Part Nine: What is Noble?

== On philosophers, free spirits, and scholars ==
In the opening two parts of the book, Nietzsche discusses, in turn, the philosophers of the past, whom he accuses of a blind dogmatism plagued by moral prejudice masquerading as a search for objective truth; and the &quot;free spirits&quot;, like himself, who are to replace them.

He casts doubt on the project of past philosophy by asking why we should want the &quot;truth&quot; rather than recognizing untruth &quot;as a condition of life.&quot; He offers an entirely psychological explanation of every past philosophy: each has been an &quot;involuntary and unconscious memoir&quot; on the part of its author (§ 6) and exists to justify his moral prejudices, which he solemnly baptizes as &quot;truths&quot;.

In one passage (§ 34), Nietzsche writes that &quot;from every point of view the &quot;erroneousness&quot; of the world in which we believe we live is the surest and firmest thing we can get our eyes on.&quot; Philosophers are wrong to rail violently against the risk of being deceived. &quot;It is no more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than appearance.&quot; Life is nothing without appearances; it appears to Nietzsche that it follows from this that the abolition of appearances would imply the abolition of &quot;truth&quot; as well. Nietzsche asks the question, &quot;what compels us to assume there exists any essential antithesis between &#x27;true&#x27; and &#x27;false&#x27;?&quot;

Nietzsche singles out the Stoic precept of &quot;living according to nature&quot; (§ 9) as showing how philosophy &quot;creates the world in its own image&quot; by trying to regiment nature &quot;according to the Stoa.&quot; But nature, as something uncontrollable and &quot;prodigal beyond measure,&quot; cannot be tyrannized over in the way Stoics tyrannize over themselves. Further, there are forceful attacks on several individual philosophers. Descartes&#x27; &quot;cogito&quot; presupposes that there is an I, that there is such an activity as thinking, and that I know what thinking is (§ 16). Spinoza masks his &quot;personal timidity and vulnerability&quot; by hiding behind his geometrical method (§ 5), and inconsistently makes self-preservation a fundamental drive while rejecting teleology (§ 13). Kant, &quot;the great Chinaman of Königsberg&quot; (§ 210), reverts to the prejudice of an old moralist with his categorical imperative, the dialectical grounding of which is a mere smokescreen (§ 5). His &quot;faculty&quot; to explain the possibility of synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgements is pejoratively compared to a passage from Molière&#x27;s comedy &quot;Le Malade imaginaire&quot; in which the narcotic quality of opium is described in terms of a &quot;sleepy faculty&quot; – according to Nietzsche, both Kant&#x27;s explanation of synthetic &quot;a priori&quot; judgments and Moliére&#x27;s comedic description of opium are examples of redundant self-referring statements which do not explain anything. Schopenhauer is mistaken in thinking that the nature of the will is self-evident (§ 19), which is, in fact, a highly complex instrument of control over those who must obey, not transparent to those who command.

&quot;Free spirits&quot;, by contrast to the philosophers of the past, are &quot;investigators to the point of cruelty, with rash fingers for the ungraspable, with teeth and stomach for the most indigestible&quot; (§ 44). Nietzsche warns against those who would suffer for the sake of truth and exhorts his readers to shun these indignant sufferers for truth and lend their ears instead to &quot;cynics&quot;—those who &quot;speak &#x27;badly&#x27; of man—but do not speak ill of him&quot; (§ 26).

There are kinds of fearless scholars who are truly independent of prejudice (§ 6), but these &quot;philosophical labourers and men of science in general&quot; should not be confused with philosophers, who are &quot;commanders and law-givers&quot; (§ 211).

Nietzsche also subjects physics to critique. &quot;Nature&#x27;s conformity to law&quot; is merely one interpretation of the phenomena which natural science observes; Nietzsche suggests that the same phenomena could equally be interpreted as demonstrating &quot;the tyrannically ruthless and inexorable enforcement of power-demands&quot; (§ 22). Nietzsche appears to espouse a strong brand of scientific anti-realism when he asserts that &quot;It is &quot;we&quot; alone who have fabricated causes, succession, reciprocity, relativity, compulsion, number, law, freedom, motive, purpose&quot; (§ 21).

== On morality and religion ==

In the &quot;pre-moral&quot; period of mankind, actions were judged by their consequences. Over the past 10,000 years, however, a morality has developed where actions are judged by their origins (their motivations) not their consequences. This morality of intentions is, according to Nietzsche, a &quot;prejudice&quot; and &quot;something provisional [...] that must be overcome&quot; (§ 32).

Nietzsche criticizes &quot;unegoistic morality&quot; and demands that &quot;Moralities must first of all be forced to bow before &quot;order of rank&quot;&quot; (§ 221). Every &quot;high culture&quot; begins by recognizing &quot;the &quot;pathos of distance&quot;&quot; (§ 257).

Nietzsche contrasts southern (Catholic) and northern (Protestant) Christianity; northern Europeans have much less &quot;talent for religion&quot; (§ 48) and lack &quot;southern &quot;delicatezza&quot;&quot; (§ 50). As elsewhere, Nietzsche praises the Old Testament while disparaging the New Testament (§ 52).

Religion has always been connected to &quot;three dangerous dietary prescriptions: solitude, fasting and sexual abstinence&quot; (§ 47), and has exerted cruelty through demanding sacrifice according to a &quot;ladder&quot; with different rungs of cruelty, which has ultimately caused God himself to be sacrificed (§ 55). Christianity, &quot;the most fatal kind of self-presumption ever&quot;, has beaten everything joyful, assertive and autocratic out of man and turned him into a &quot;sublime abortion&quot; (§ 62). If, unlike past philosophers such as Schopenhauer, we really want to tackle the problems of morality, we must &quot;compare &quot;many&quot; moralities&quot; and &quot;prepare a &quot;typology&quot; of morals&quot; (§ 186). In a discussion that anticipates &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot;, Nietzsche claims that &quot;Morality is in Europe today herd-animal morality&quot; (§ 202)—i.e., it emanates from the &quot;ressentiment&quot; of the slave for the master (see also § 260, which leads into the discussion in &quot;Genealogy&quot;, I).

Nietzsche argues that more than what they value as &quot;good&quot; distinguishes noble and base. Even where agreement exists over what is good, what men consider a sufficient sign of possessing what is good differs (§ 194). Nietzsche describes love as the desire to possess a woman. The most unrefined form of the desire is also the most readily identifiable as a desire to possess another: control over the woman&#x27;s body. A subtler desire to possess her also wants her soul, and thus wants her to be willing to sacrifice herself for her lover. Nietzsche describes this as a more complete possession. A still more refined desire to possess her prompts a concern that she might be willing to sacrifice what she desires for a mistaken image of her lover. This leads some lovers to want their women to know them deep down so that their sacrifice really is a sacrifice for &quot;them&quot;. A similar rank-ordering applies to statesmen, the less refined not caring whether they attain power by fraud, the more refined not taking pleasure in the people&#x27;s love unless they love the statesman for who he really is. In both cases, the more spiritualized form of the desire to possess also demands one possess what is good more completely.

In § 259, Nietzsche states that to not injure, exploit or be violent to others as a general principle of society is &quot;a Will to the &quot;denial&quot; of life, a principle of dissolution and decay.&quot; He goes on to argue that life is &quot;essentially appropriation, injury, conquest of the strange and weak.&quot;

== On nations, peoples and cultures ==

Nietzsche discusses the complexities of the German soul (§ 244), praises the Jews and heavily criticizes the trend of German antisemitism (§ 251). He praises France as &quot;the seat of Europe&#x27;s most spiritual and refined culture and the leading school of taste&quot; (§ 254). He finds the English coarse, gloomy, more brutal than the Germans, and declares that &quot;they are no philosophical race&quot;, singling out Bacon, Hobbes, Hume and Locke as representing a &quot;debasement and devaluation of the concept &#x27;philosopher&#x27; for more than a century&quot; (§ 252). Nietzsche also touches on problems of translation and the leaden quality of the German language (§ 28).

In a prophetic statement, Nietzsche proclaims that &quot;The time for petty politics is past: the very next century will bring with it the struggle for mastery over the whole earth&quot; (§ 208).

== Aphorisms and poetry ==

Between § 62 and § 186 Nietzsche inserts a collection of mostly single-sentence aphorisms, modelled on French aphorists such as La Rochefoucauld. Twelve of these (§§ 84, 85, 86, 114, 115, 127, 131, 139, 144, 145, 147, 148) concern women or the distinction between men and women. Other subjects touched on include his doctrine of the eternal recurrence (§ 70), music (§ 106) and utilitarianism (§ 174), among more general attempts at trenchant observations about human nature.

The work concludes with a short ode to friendship in verse form (continuing Nietzsche&#x27;s use of poetry in &quot;The Gay Science&quot; and &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;).

<doc id="575674" wikidata="Q3137742" url="?curid=575674" title="Kamikaze (Twista album)">
<text>Kamikaze is the fourth studio album by American rapper Twista. It was released on January 27, 2004, by Atlantic Records. The album reached the top of the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in early 2004, after the success of its lead single, &quot;Slow Jamz&quot;. It sold 312,000 units in its first week of sales, and received generally positive reviews from critics. It is Twista&#x27;s most successful album, being certified double platinum by the RIAA.

==Background==
On his website, Twista stated that he made &quot;Kamikaze&quot; to show that he was still true to the ideals that he had when he started out. &quot;I represent for the MCs that have skills, not just make music for the hell of it. I take the time to concentrate. Otherwise, I could have 10 albums out there, easy. I could sit down all day and write something. But I write when I get in a zone more than writing because I’ve got to do this. I represent the artists that keep it true to what really is, to be able to make rappers want to write.&quot;

&quot;I want to show the streets that I&#x27;m back and that I&#x27;m true to the game. Musically, I want to show that I&#x27;m still out here doing my thing. After all the people that were out when I was out years ago fell off, I’m still out here competing with the shorties. I also want to gain platinum success. It&#x27;s something that I haven&#x27;t done.&quot;

The song &quot;Sunshine&quot; contains the backing track from Lovely Day by Bill Withers.

The song &quot;Overnight Celebrity&quot; contains a sample of the Lenny Williams&#x27; 1978 song &quot;Cause I Love You&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The album has a score of 66 out of 100 based on &quot;generally positive reviews&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a favorable review and stated that the album &quot;feels eclectic without stooping to demographics-pandering, though its contradictory elements create a few jarring moments.&quot; E! Online gave it a B and said, &quot;Twista still manages to steal the limelight on hot booty-busters like &#x27;Slow Jamz&#x27; and &#x27;Pimp On.&#x27;&quot; Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven stars out of ten and called it &quot;overlong, like almost every rap album today, and it&#x27;s not the sort of place to come expecting erudition or insight. But for one singular rapper unwilling and unafraid to stick to his guns, it&#x27;s a deeply satisfying record.&quot; Other reviews are pretty average or mixed: &quot;Q&quot; gave it three stars out of five and said, &quot;Twista&#x27;s overshadowed by [Kanye] West, but with jacked-up soul tunes such as &#x27;Overnight Celebrity&#x27;, the result, who cares?&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, however, gave it a mixed review and said that the album &quot;Suggests nothing so much as &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot; part two.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The first single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; featured Kanye West and Jamie Foxx. It topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and world R&amp;B charts in early 2004. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; built on the success of &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; to reach the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts on release in January 2004 and to go Platinum by March 2004. The second single &quot;Overnight Celebrity&quot; had also reached top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and world R&amp;B chart in March 2004. The single &quot;So Sexy&quot; with R. Kelly reached #25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming a success.

<doc id="575697" wikidata="Q910164" url="?curid=575697" title="Cheminformatics">
<text>Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics) refers to the use of physical chemistry theory with computer and information science techniques—so called &quot;in silico&quot; techniques—in application to a range of descriptive and prescriptive problems in the field of chemistry, including in its applications to biology and related molecular fields. Such &quot;in silico&quot; techniques are used, for example, by pharmaceutical companies and in academic settings to aid and inform the process of drug discovery, for instance in the design of well-defined combinatorial libraries of synthetic compounds, or to assist in structure-based drug design. The methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries, and such fields as environmental science and pharmacology, where chemical processes are involved or studied.

== History ==
Cheminformatics has been an active field in various guises since the 1970s and earlier, with activity in academic departments and commercial pharmaceutical research and development departments. The term chemoinformatics was defined in its application to drug discovery by F.K. Brown in 1998:Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization. Since then, both terms, cheminformatics and chemoinformatics, have been used, although, lexicographically, cheminformatics appears to be more frequently used, despite academics in Europe declaring for the variant chemoinformatics in 2006. In 2009, a prominent Springer journal in the field was founded by transatlantic executive editors named the Journal of Cheminformatics.

== Background ==
Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of chemistry, computer science, and information science—for example in the areas of topology, chemical graph theory, information retrieval and data mining in the chemical space. Cheminformatics can also be applied to data analysis for various industries like paper and pulp, dyes and such allied industries.

== Applications ==
===Storage and retrieval===
A primary application of cheminformatics is the storage, indexing, and search of information relating to chemical compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science, such as data mining, information retrieval, information extraction, and machine learning. Related research topics include:

* Digital libraries
* Unstructured data
* Structured data mining and mining of structured data
**Database mining
**Graph mining
**Molecule mining
**Sequence mining
**Tree mining
==== File formats ====

The &quot;in silico&quot; representation of chemical structures uses specialized formats such as the Simplified molecular input line entry specifications (SMILES) or the XML-based Chemical Markup Language. These representations are often used for storage in large chemical databases. While some formats are suited for visual representations in two- or three-dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.

=== Virtual libraries ===

Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules. Virtual libraries of compounds may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel compounds with desired properties. Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm. This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a Markov chain on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.

=== Virtual screening ===
In contrast to high-throughput screening, virtual screening involves computationally
screening &quot;in silico&quot; libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as
docking, to identify members likely to possess desired properties
such as biological activity against a given target. In some cases, combinatorial chemistry is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or natural products is screened.

===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)===

This is the calculation of quantitative structure–activity relationship and quantitative structure property relationship values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to chemometrics. Chemical expert systems are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an &quot;in silico&quot; representation. There is a relatively new concept of matched molecular pair analysis or prediction-driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliff.

<text>John Russell Pope (April 24, 1874 – August 27, 1937) was an American architect whose firm is widely known for designing major public buildings, including the National Archives and Records Administration building (completed in 1935), the Jefferson Memorial (completed in 1943) and the West Building of the National Gallery of Art (completed in 1941), all in Washington, D.C.

==Early life and education==
Pope was born in New York City, on April 24, 1874, the son of a successful portrait painter and his wife. He studied architecture at Columbia University, where he graduated in 1894. He was the first recipient of the Rome Prize to attend the newly founded American Academy in Rome, a training ground for the designers of the American Renaissance. He would remain involved with the academy until his death.

Pope traveled for two years through Italy and Greece, where he studied, sketched and made measured drawings of more Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance structures than he did of the remains of ancient buildings. Pope was one of the first architectural students to master the use of the large-format camera, with glass negatives. Pope attended the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1896, honing his Beaux-Arts style.

==Career==


In 1900, after returning to New York City, Pope worked for a few years in the office of Bruce Price before opening his own practice.

Pope designed private houses, such as The Waves, his personal residence in Newport, Rhode Island, and public buildings in addition to the Jefferson Memorial, the National Gallery of Art, the Masonic House of the Temple, all in Washington, D.C., and the triumphal arch Theodore Roosevelt Memorial (1936) at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

He designed the extension of the Henry Clay Frick mansion in New York City that created the Garden Court and music room, among other features, as the house was expanded to be operated as a museum.

In 1912, he submitted several proposals for the Lincoln Memorial, but lost out to Henry Bacon.

In 1919, he developed a master plan for the future growth of Yale University. Pope&#x27;s plan for Yale was significantly revised by James Gamble Rogers in 1921, who had more sympathy for the requirements of the city of New Haven, Connecticut. Rogers did keep the Collegiate Gothic unifying theme offered by Pope. Pope&#x27;s original plan is a prime document in the City Beautiful movement in city planning. 

His firm&#x27;s designs alternated between revivals of Gothic, Georgian, eighteenth-century French, and classical styles. Pope designed the Henry E. Huntington mausoleum on the grounds of The Huntington Library in southern California. He later used the design as a prototype for the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Jefferson Memorial and the National Gallery of Art were both neoclassical, modeled by Pope on the Roman Pantheon.

Lesser known projects by Pope&#x27;s firm include Union Station, Richmond, Virginia (1917), with a central rotunda capped with a low saucer dome; it now houses the Science Museum of Virginia, the Branch House (1917–1919), a Tudor-style mansion in Richmond, now housing The Branch Museum of Architecture and Design; the Baltimore Museum of Art; and in Washington, D.C., the National City Christian Church, DAR Constitution Hall, American Pharmacists Association Building, Ward Homestead, and the National Archives Building (&quot;illustration, left&quot;). 

In 1917, he designed the City Hall in Plattsburgh, New York, which was completed in 1917, and the city&#x27;s Macdonough Monument, erected in 1926 to commemorate the naval victory of Commodore Macdonough in the Battle of Plattsburgh on September 11, 1814.

Pope designed additions to the Tate Gallery and British Museum in London, an unusual honor for an American architect, and the War Memorial at Montfaucon-d&#x27;Argonne, France. Pope also designed extensive alterations to Belcourt, the Newport residence of Oliver and Alva Belmont. The Georgian Revival residence he built in 1919 for Thomas H. Frothingham in Far Hills, New Jersey has been adapted as the United States Golf Association Museum.

Pope was a member of the United States Commission of Fine Arts in Washington, D.C. from 1912 to 1922, serving as vice chairman from 1921 to 1922. He also served on the Board of Architectural Consultants for the Federal Triangle complex in Washington, D.C. During the 1920s, the firm designed a number of well known country estates including Spring Hill Farms, later renamed Cobble Court. 

In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he designed a severe neo-Georgian clubhouse for the University Club (1926). In Oneonta, New York, he designed the first building for Hartwick College, Bresee Hall, which was constructed in 1928. 

In 1932, he constructed the chapter house for Alpha Delta Phi at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. 

Pope won a Silver Medal in the 1932 Summer Olympics for his design of the Payne Whitney Gymnasium.

===Legacy===
A 1991 exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, &quot;John Russell Pope and the Building of the National Gallery of Art&quot;, spurred reappraisal of his work. For some time, it had been scorned and derided as overly historicist by many critics influenced by International Modernism.

Pope also served as an early mentor and employer of American modernist Lester C. Tichy.

Pope was the maternal grandfather of the actress Andra Akers.

<text>The Handley Page Halifax is a British Royal Air Force (RAF) four-engined heavy bomber of the Second World War. It was developed by Handley Page to the same specification as the contemporary twin-engine Avro Manchester.

The Halifax has its origins in the twin-engine &quot;H.P.56&quot; proposal of the late 1930s, produced in response to the British Air Ministry&#x27;s Specification P.13/36 for a capable medium bomber for &quot;world-wide use.&quot; The H.P.56 was ordered as a backup to the Avro 679, both aircraft being designed to use the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine. The Handley Page design was altered to use four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines while the rival Avro 679 was produced as the twin-engine Avro Manchester which, while regarded as unsuccessful mainly due to the Vulture engine, was a direct predecessor of the Avro Lancaster. Both the Lancaster and the Halifax emerged as capable four-engine strategic bombers, thousands of which were used during the War.

The Halifax performed its first flight on 25 October 1939, and entered service with the RAF on 13 November 1940. It quickly became a major component of Bomber Command, performing strategic bombing missions against the Axis Powers, primarily at night. Arthur Harris, the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Bomber Command, described the Halifax as inferior to the rival Lancaster (in part due to its smaller payload) though this opinion was not shared by many of the crews that flew it. Nevertheless, production of the Halifax continued until April 1945. During their service with Bomber Command, Halifaxes flew 82,773 operations and dropped of bombs, while 1,833 aircraft were lost. The Halifax was also flown in large numbers by other Allied and Commonwealth nations, such as the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and Free French Air Force.

Various improved versions of the Halifax were introduced, incorporating more powerful engines, a revised defensive turret layout and increased payload. It remained in service with Bomber Command until the end of the war, performing a variety of duties in addition to bombing. Specialised versions of the Halifax were developed for troop transport and paradrop operations. After the Second World War, the RAF quickly retired the Halifax, the type being succeeded as a strategic bomber by the Avro Lincoln, an advanced derivative of the Lancaster. During the post-war years, the Halifax was operated by the Royal Egyptian Air Force, the French Air Force and the Royal Pakistan Air Force. The type also entered commercial service for a number of years, used mainly as a freighter. A dedicated civil transport variant, the Handley Page Halton, was also developed and entered airline service; 41 civil Halifax freighters were used during the Berlin Airlift. In 1961, the last remaining Halifax bombers were retired from operational use.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the 1930s, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was primarily interested in twin-engine bombers. These designs put significant demands on engine production and maintenance, both of which were already stretched with the introduction of many new types of aircraft into service. Power limitations were so serious that the British invested heavily in the development of huge engines in the class to improve performance. However, during the late 1930s, none of these engines were ready for production. Meanwhile, the United States, France, Germany and the Soviet Union were developing bombers powered with four engines with favourable results, including excellent range and lifting capacity. Accordingly, in 1936, the RAF decided to investigate the feasibility of a four-engined bomber.

During the mid-1930s, the British Air Ministry released Specification P.13/36, seeking a twin-engine heavy-medium bomber suitable for &quot;world-wide use&quot;. Further requirements of the specification included the use of a mid-mounted cantilever monoplane wing and all-metal construction, and encouraged use of the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine then in development. In response, Handley Page produced the twin-engine &quot;H.P.56&quot; design to meet Specification P.13/36. Handley Page aircraft designer George Volkert had responsibility for the design.

Other candidates were submitted for the same specification, including the Avro 679, and designs from Fairey, Boulton Paul and Shorts. All submissions used two engines, using the Rolls-Royce Vulture, Napier Sabre, Fairey P.24 or Bristol Hercules engines. All of these engines were under development and while four-engined bomber designs were considered for specification B.12/36 for a heavy bomber, wings mounting two pairs of engines required additional testing at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). A stronger wing also required additional strengthening of the overall aircraft structure, increasing design weight.

In February 1937, following consideration of the designs, the Air Ministry selected Avro&#x27;s submission, with Handley Page&#x27;s bid chosen as &quot;second string&quot;. Accordingly, during April 1937, the Air Ministry ordered two prototypes of each design. The introduction of the successful P.13/36 candidates was delayed by orders for Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley and Vickers Wellington bombers. In mid-1937, it was decided to order both the Avro 679 and H.P.56 designs &quot;off the drawing board&quot; in order to speed up delivery timetables.

During July 1937, Handley Page was instructed to redesign the H.P.56 to use four engines. The Vulture had already been suffering reliability and performance problems. The rival Avro 679 proceeded into service as the Avro Manchester powered by a pair of Vulture engines, but was only built in limited quantities after suffering substantially from engine-related difficulties. The four-engine redesign increased its wingspan from to and added of weight. In September 1937, the Ministry specified the use of four Rolls-Royce Merlin engines; according to aviation author Phillip J. R. Moyes, this redesign to four Merlin engines was done &quot;much against the company&#x27;s wishes&quot;.

Towards the end of the year, a full-size mock-up was assessed and production of a pair of &quot;H.P.57&quot; prototypes commenced in March 1938. Further design modifications resulted in the definitive aircraft, now considerably enlarged and powered by four Rolls-Royce Merlin X engines. Such was the promise of the new model that, in January 1938, the RAF chose to place their first production order for the type, ordering 100 Mk.I Halifaxes &quot;off the drawing board&quot;, at which point the serials which had already been assigned to the H.P.56 were switched to the H.P.57.

===Prototypes===

The first prototype was built at Handley Page&#x27;s facility in Cricklewood, London, It was then dismantled and transported by road to RAF Bicester (the nearest non-operational RAF airfield with suitable facilities) for reassembly. The first flight of the first prototype Halifax, serial number &quot;L7244&quot;, was performed by chief test pilot Jim Cordes with E A &#x27;Ginger&#x27; Wright as flight test observer on 25 October 1939. During this flight, the undercarriage was locked down as a safety precaution.

On 17 August 1940, the first flight of the second prototype, &quot;L7245&quot;, now complete with full armament and operational equipment, was made from Radlett Aerodrome. The H.P.57 was given the service name &quot;Halifax&quot; upon acceptance. This name followed the practice of naming heavy bombers after major towns, which in this case was Halifax in Yorkshire. In September 1941, a production Halifax Mk.I participated in an official naming ceremony of the type, officiated by Lord Halifax and Lady Halifax.

===Production===

Series production of the Halifax began at Handley Page&#x27;s factory at Cricklewood and at English Electric&#x27;s site in Samlesbury, Lancashire. In order to speed up production, Handley Page implemented several new manufacturing techniques, including two pioneering approaches: photo-lofting and split construction. In the latter capacity, each Halifax was built from various sub-assemblies. Surface panels were flush-riveted, although the matt black night bomber camouflage negated its benefit.

Handley Page built the assemblies and components at Cricklewood and the aircraft were assembled and flown from Radlett Aerodrome. The first production aircraft flew from Radlett on 11 October 1940.

The sizeable production run envisioned required the involvement of several other companies in addition to Handley Page. The resulting &quot;Halifax Group&quot; was established to oversee the manufacturing programme, comprising English Electric (who had previously built Handley Page Hampdens), various firms within the London Aircraft Production Group, Fairey Aviation, and Rootes Motors. Because of this scheme, Halifaxes were manufactured at sites across the British isles.

The Halifax was produced in large numbers during the war and over 40%, or 4,046 of the 10,018 heavy bombers produced in Britain between 1940 and 1944 were Halifaxes. In all, 6,178 Halifaxes were built, the last delivered in April 1945. At the peak, 41 separate factories and dispersed units were involved in production, along with 600 subcontractors and 51,000 employees, with one Halifax completed every hour. The first English Electric-built aircraft was flown from Samlesbury on 15 August 1941.

The first production standard Halifax, the Mk.I, had a long bomb bay and six wing bomb cells, and could carry a load. Defensive armament consisted of two Browning machine guns in a Boulton Paul Type C nose turret, with an additional four in a Boulton Paul Type E tail turret. Some aircraft included two additional Vickers K machine guns in beam (side, or &quot;waist&quot;) positions. Subtle modifications distinguished the Mk.I aircraft. Aircraft of the first batch of fifty Mk.I Halifaxes were designated Mk.I Series I.

===Improvements===
Handley Page were initially disappointed with the performance of the Halifax which was below their predictions, much of this was because they had under-estimated the aircraft&#x27;s drag. The Mk.III Halifax had a wider span of and had significantly improved performance. Arguably the Merlin engine did not suit the Halifax as much as the Hercules (fitted from the Mk.III on) which suited the Halifax better both aerodynamically and power-wise.

The Halifax Mk.I was quickly followed by 25 of the Mk.I Series II; these featured an increased gross weight from to but with maximum landing weight unchanged at . The Halifax Mk.I Series III featured increased fuel capacity ( and larger oil coolers, the latter of which having been adopted in order to accommodate the Merlin XX engine. A dorsally-mounted two-gun Boulton Paul Type C turret replaced the beam guns.

Introduction of Merlin XX engines and a twin dorsal turret instead of waist guns resulted in the Halifax B Mk.II Series I. The Mk.II Series I (Special) achieved improved performance via the removal of the nose and dorsal turrets. The Halifax Mk.II Series IA was fitted with a moulded Perspex nose (this nose became standard upon future Halifax variants), a four-gun Boulton Paul Type A dorsal turret similar to that used in the Boulton Paul Defiant, and Merlin 22 engines. The rudder overbalance / directional instability with engine(s) out problem was solved on the Mk.III with the fitting of a larger D type fin (40% bigger) and modified rudder. The Mk.III Halifax had satisfactory stability in all axes and was more stable in a dive than a Lancaster. A Lancaster tended to go deeper into a dive whereas a Halifax had to be forced to stay in the dive as the speed increased, i.e. it naturally flew out of a dive.

Owing to a shortage of Messier-built landing gear and hydraulics, Dowty-built landing gear were used on some aircraft instead. As it was incompatible with the Messier equipment, this led to these Halifax bombers being given new designations: a Mark II built with Dowty gear was the Mark V. The use of castings rather than forgings in the Dowty undercarriage had resulted in an increased production rate but had also led to a reduced landing weight of . The Halifax Mark V were manufactured by Rootes Group at Speke and Fairey at Stockport; operationally, these were generally used by Coastal Command and for training purposes. Some 904 had been built when Mark V production ended at the start of 1944, compared to 1,966 Halifax Mk.IIs.

The most numerous Halifax variant was the much improved B Mk.III of which 2,091 were built. First appearing in 1943, the Mk.III featured the Perspex nose and modified tail of the Mk.II Series IA but replaced the Merlin with the more powerful Bristol Hercules XVI radial engine. Other changes included the adoption of de Havilland Hydromatic propellers and a wider wing span with rounded wing tips. With the coming of the Mk.III the Halifax&#x27;s performance finally matched that of the Lancaster though the latter had a larger bomb load and could take larger bombs. The B.VI Halifax&#x27;s performance improved still further with a cruising speed of and a maximum speed (in &#x27;Full Speed&#x27; supercharger mode) of at . Halifax crews, though admittedly not unbiased, considered the Mk.III Halifax to be the equal of any other bomber, including the Lancaster, and further improved versions (with more powerful Hercules engines) to be superior to all. The improvement in the Halifax Mk.III&#x27;s performance could be measured objectively. In 1943 4 Group&#x27;s Halifax squadrons flew 11,607 sorties for a loss of 485 aircraft, a loss rate of 4.2%. Halifax Mk.III production started in early Autumn 1943 and for 1944, when the Mk.III constituted an increasing percentage of the Halifax force, 4 Group flew 25,454 sorties for a loss of 402 aircraft, a loss rate of 1.6%.

The Halifax B Mk.IV was a converted B Mk.II non-production design using the Rolls-Royce Merlin 65 engine with a two-stage supercharger and a four-bladed propeller fitted. This resulted in an increase in top speed by to at . Due to a shortage of Merlins with two-stage superchargers production of the B Mk.IV was not proceeded with.

The definitive version of the Halifax was the B Mk.VI, powered by the Hercules 100. The final bomber version, the Mk.VII, reverted to the less powerful Hercules XVI. However, these variants were produced in relatively small quantities.

The remaining variants were the Halifax C Mk.VIII, an unarmed transport that was fitted with an cargo pannier instead of a bomb bay, which could accommodate a maximum of 11 passengers and the Mk A IX paratroop transport, which had space for up to 16 paratroopers and their equipment. A transport/cargo version of the Halifax was also produced, known as the Handley Page Halton.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Handley Page Halifax was a mostly orthodox design, a mid-wing monoplane with a tail unit featuring twin fins and rudders. The Halifax featured all-metal construction with a smooth, stressed skin covering the majority of the exterior surfaces; the flight control surfaces were an exception, being fabric-covered instead. The slab-sided fuselage contained a 22-foot bomb bay, which contained the majority of the Halifax&#x27;s payload, while the cockpit was flush with the upper fuselage.

The Halifax was powered by four engines, two on each wing. Early production Halifax bombers were powered by models of the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine; later aircraft were commonly powered by the larger Bristol Hercules radial engine. To contain and attach the engines to the airframe, Handley Page developed their own design for the power egg instead of using the typical, slimmer Rolls-Royce counterpart; despite generating increased drag, this in-house design was readily adaptable to the alternative Hercules engine on later aircraft.

Each engine drove a Rotol-built compressed wood constant-speed propeller, enabling the Halifax B.I to attain a maximum speed of at . With a typical payload of of bombs and of fuel, it had a range of . The defensive armaments included power-assisted gun turrets in various positions located across the aircraft. Different models of the Halifax used different numbers and combinations of turrets, effectively trading speed for firepower and vice versa.

===Crew positions and armament===
The bomb aimer&#x27;s position was in the extreme nose with the navigator&#x27;s table located behind it, both roles fulfilled by the same crew member. Above the navigator&#x27;s position was the forward gun turret. The wireless (radio) operator was behind the navigator&#x27;s position, separated by a half-width partition.
On the floor just behind the front turret (or later the nose) was the escape hatch. This was , the same size as the Stirling, and slightly larger than the for the Lancaster. On average 25% of Halifax and Stirling crews successfully bailed out from a damaged aeroplane, but only 15% did so from Lancasters.

The pilot sat on the left side in the cockpit above the wireless operator. The flight engineer filled in as a co-pilot, seated on a folding seat to the right of the pilot during crucial manoeuvres such as take-off. Aft of the pilot and set lower than the pilot was the flight engineer&#x27;s compartment with controls on the bulkhead. Another compartment aft of the flight engineer contained two bunks originally intended for resting crew members, but almost always used for treating and berthing injured crew. This area led to the two-gun dorsal turret. The tail gunner occupied a four-gun turret at the extreme aft end of the aircraft.

Starting with the Halifax Mk.II Series IA and from the Mk.III onwards, the nose turret was deleted; instead the bomb-aimer occupied a streamlined perspex nose containing a single hand-held machine gun. On later-built aircraft, the two-gun dorsal turret was replaced by a four-gun Boulton Paul turret.

The maximum bomb load was , which was primarily carried in a bomb bay housed within the fuselage, divided into six separate bomb compartments, with three bomb compartments in the inboard sections of each wing; this division of the payload between multiple compartments limited the maximum size of the individual bombs which could be completely enclosed to ; when carrying the 4,000lb and 8,000lb high capacity (HC) bombs the bomb bay doors could not close fully.

==Operational service==

In November 1940, the Handley Page Halifax entered service with No. 35 Squadron at RAF Linton-on-Ouse. Its operational debut occurred on the night of 10–11 March 1941, when six Halifax bombers flew a bombing raid against Le Havre, targeting the area around the docks and any shipping that might be present. The existence of the Halifax was not officially acknowledged until July 1941, after it was used in a daylight attack on La Pallice, France, against the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. At the end of 1941, the Halifax was withdrawn from daylight bombing operations after intensifying fighter opposition had increased the casualty rates to unsustainable levels.

In the second half of 1942, No. 35 Squadron and four other squadrons were selected to form the Pathfinder Force, later expanded to become No. 8 Group. Pathfinder crews flying the Halifax would mark routes and identify and mark targets for the Main Force. Effective marking greatly increased the accuracy and destructive power of Bomber Command. As a Pathfinder and Main Force aircraft, the Halifax was a core part of the bombing offensive against Germany and its Axis allies.

By the end of 1943, No. 4 Group had been entirely equipped with the Halifax, and would continue to operate the aircraft until the end of the war. No. 6 Group, formed of Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) squadrons, also adopted the Halifax around the same time, and would go on to operate it in each of its 14 squadrons, although it was never solely equipped with the type. At its peak strength, Bomber Command operated a total of 76 Halifax-equipped squadrons.
While the early-built models of the Halifax were heavily used by Bomber Command and made valuable contributions to operations, the aircraft&#x27;s performance was considered unsatisfactory for the most part, mainly due to the underpowered Merlin engine, which meant that it could not fly at the higher altitudes needed to avoid enemy fighters, which were becoming increasingly effective throughout 1943. This was answered by the Halifax Mk.III, which was powered by Bristol Hercules radial engines in place of the Merlins. Introduced into service in November 1943, the Mk.III was first delivered to No. 433 Squadron and No. 466 Squadron. By January 1944, the Hercules-powered Halifax was available in quantity and quickly proved to have superior performance in the face of German fighter defences.

Early on, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Harris, head of Bomber Command, was scathing in his criticism of the Halifax&#x27;s performance in comparison to the new Avro Lancaster, primarily of its bomb-carrying capability: an average Halifax was calculated to drop 100 tons of bombs in its lifetime, compared to a Lancaster&#x27;s 154. Harris continued to have a poor opinion of the Halifax, despite the fact that later Hercules-engined machines had lower loss rates and higher crew survival rates after abandoning the aircraft than Lancasters, and came very close to the Lancaster&#x27;s speed and altitude performance. The Halifax was progressively outnumbered in front-line service over occupied Europe as more Lancasters became available from 1943 onwards; many squadrons converted to the Lancaster.

Production of the Halifax continued, supposedly because it was more efficient to keep building it than to stop its production and convert to building another aircraft. But any new facilities were devoted to the Lancaster.
Harris&#x27;s view of the Halifax changed sometime after spring 1942. On 2 June 1942, in a response to a telegram sent by Frederick Handley Page, congratulating Harris on the success of the first 1000 bomber Cologne raid, he stated: &quot;My Dear Handley Page. We much appreciate your telegram of congratulation on Saturday night&#x27;s work, the success of which was very largely due to your support in giving us such a powerful weapon to wield. Between us we will make a job of it.&quot;

Following the invasion of Europe in 1944, the Halifax resumed daylight bombing operations, performing semi-tactical strikes upon enemy troop concentrations, gun emplacements, and strongpoints of the Atlantic Wall defences along the French coast with a reportedly high degree of accuracy. Other common targets were enemy communications and the launch sites for V-1 flying bombs. Bombing activity became increasingly brazen throughout late 1944 as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; became incapable of putting up effective opposition against allied air forces. The Halifax also found itself being increasingly tasked with transport duties around this time; in one instance, around half a million gallons of petrol was delivered to Brussels in support of the advancing Second Army, then engaged in heavy fighting at Arnhem.

During the latter half of 1944, the bombing of German-held oil facilities became a major priority of the offensive. On 27 August, a force of 216 Halifax bombers, alongside smaller numbers of de Havilland Mosquitos and Lancasters and a sizable escort of Supermarine Spitfires, conducted the first major daylight operation by Bomber Command against a target inside Germany that year, attacking the oil refinery at Homberg on the Ruhr. In spite of heavy fire from anti-aircraft defenses, no bombers were downed and the refinery was severely damaged in places. Attacks upon oil production facilities throughout Germany would become commonplace within the remaining months of the war.
The only Victoria Cross to be awarded to any Halifax pilot went to Cyril J. Barton of No. 578 Squadron for displaying great gallantry in bringing his heavily damaged aircraft back after a raid on Nuremberg on the night of 30/31 March 1944. Barton continued to fly the Halifax while other crew members bailed out. He was killed in the aircraft&#x27;s crash-landing, but the remaining crew survived due to his actions.
Large numbers of Halifax bombers were also operated by Coastal Command, which used it to conduct anti submarine warfare, reconnaissance and meteorological operations. The Halifax was heavily used to deploy mines in the vicinity of enemy-held ports. It served increasingly in other support capacities as the war progressed, being used as a glider tug, an electronic warfare aircraft for No. 100 Group and to conduct special operations, such as parachuting agents and arms into occupied Europe, for the Special Operations Executive (SOE). As a glider tug the Halifax was superior to the Lancaster, the Halifax Mk.III&#x27;s &quot;tug weight at take off&quot; was higher than a Lancaster Mk.II&#x27;s .

Throughout early 1945, the Halifax was frequently dispatched against cities within the German homeland, including Hannover, Magdeburg, Stuttgart, Cologne, Münster, Osnabrück and others. During these months, infrastructure such as oil facilities and railways were given a high priority; these targets were attacked right up until the end of the war. According to Moyes, within the final few months, bomber losses had fallen to all-time lows while raids were frequently regarded as having been highly successful. During the final months of the war the improved Halifax Mk.VI and Mk.VII were introduced. In particular, these models had been &#x27;tropicalised&#x27; with an eye towards their potential use in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan. While some of these Mk.VI and Mk.VII machines were deployed to the theatre, they played little meaningful role as the war ended before larger numbers could be brought to bear against Japanese forces.

On 25 April 1945, the Halifax performed its last major operation against the enemy in WWII during an attack upon coastal gun batteries on Wangerooge in the Frisian Islands of the North Sea. While the type continued to fly operations after this, these were primarily diversions to other operations and sporadic, uncoordinated attacks against targets of opportunity. Upon the end of the conflict, Bomber Command quickly disbanded the majority of its Halifax-equipped squadrons; the aircraft themselves were transferred to Transport Command. During the type&#x27;s service with Bomber Command, Halifaxes flew 82,773 operations and dropped 224,207 tons of bombs. 1,833 aircraft were lost.

By 1947, the majority of Halifax bombers were deemed to be surplus and scrapped. The Halifax remained in widespread service with Coastal Command and RAF Transport Command, Royal Egyptian Air Force and the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; until early 1952.

The Royal Pakistan Air Force however continued operating them up till 1961, thus Pakistan became the last military user of the type. In 1947, the RPAF inherited two Halifax bombers from the RAF which were later heavily used during the 1st Kashmir War in 1948. RPAF Halifaxes flew several sorties in support of Pakistani and Kashmiri forces (notably in the Battle of Skardu) during which they conducted night-time Airdrop missions. After the war, six ex-RAF Halifax-BVIs were purchased in 1949. Due to their high operational costs, the RPAF Commanders decided not to enlarge the Halifax fleet too much. These airplanes were later transferred to the newly raised No. 12 Squadron PAF, where they were only used in emergency situations. Gradually, they were transferred to long term storage and were later scrapped.

In September 1997 Halifax 57 Rescue of Canada excavated Halifax LW682 from a bog near the River Dender in Belgium. The plane was part of RCAF 426 Squadron, and had been shot down near Geraardsbergen during a raid on Leuven, Belgium on 12 May 1944. During the excavation, the bodies of three crew members were recovered and later given proper burial. Several items from the plane were used in restoration of NA337, while other items were transferred to museums. The airframe was melted down and used to construct the ceiling of the RAF Bomber Command Memorial in London, which was unveiled in 2012.

===Civilian operation===

A number of former RAF Halifax C.8s were sold from 1945 and used as freighters by a number of mostly British airlines. In 1948, 41 civilian Halifax freighters were used during the Berlin Air Lift, operating 4,653 sorties carrying freight and 3,509 carrying bulk diesel fuel. Nine aircraft were lost during the airlift. The low-cost airline business pioneer Freddie Laker bought and serviced war-surplus Halifaxes for Bond Air Services operations in the Berlin airlift. With the airfreight market in decline, most of the civilian Halifaxes were scrapped on their return to England. The last civilian-operated Halifaxes were withdrawn from service in late 1952.

== Variants ==
===Pre-Halifax designs===
;H.P.55
:Proposed twin-engine bomber aircraft, never built.
;H.P.56
:Proposed twin-engine bomber aircraft, fitted with two Rolls-Royce Vulture engines, never built.

===H.P.57===
;H.P.57
:L7244 – Prototype first flew on The first Halifax prototype with four Merlin 10 engines and no armament.
:L7245 – Second prototype first flew from Radlett on 17 August 1940 and was more representative of the production configuration including armament.
;;Halifax B.I Series I

::Four-engined long-range heavy-bomber aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Merlin X engines; the first production version. Armament consisted of nose turret with two guns, tail turret with four guns and two beam guns. Recognizable from large deep radiator intakes containing circular Gallay radiators and oil cooler. 50 produced.
;;Halifax B.I Series II
::Stressed for operating at a higher gross weight. 25 produced.
;;Halifax B.I Series III
::Re-engined with Merlin XX engines with slimmer coolers, introduced new twin-gun Boulton Paul type C upper turret in place of beam guns, with revised undercarriage and additional centre-section fuel tanks. 9 produced.

===H.P.58===
;Halifax Mk.II
:Projected variant with revised armament including cannon and no tail turret. Due to problems with the new armament, the project was cancelled and the Mk.II designation given to H.P.59.

===H.P.59===
;Halifax Mk.II
:New variant with increased takeoff weight, fuel and weapons carriage.
;Halifax B.II Series I
:First series of the bomber variant; from March 1942 onwards, these were fitted with TR1335 navigation aids.
;Halifax B.II Series I (Special), SOE
:Special version for Special Operations Executive (SOE) used to drop supplies over Europe. Nose armament and dorsal turret removed, the nose being faired over, as well as changes to the fuel vent pipes and exhaust shrouds.
;Halifax B.II Series I (Special)
:Generally similar to the aircraft used by the SOE, these were employed in the bombing role. These aircraft were more varied in appearance, especially concerning the fitting of dorsal armament with some aircraft retaining the standard Boulton Paul &quot;Type C&quot; turret in different mounts with others mounting a &quot;Type A&quot; turret. There were also examples with no dorsal turret, similar to the SOE-aircraft.
;Halifax B.II Series IA
:Modified with new glazed nose section, Merlin XX or 22 engines, new square Morris radiators and new &quot;D&quot; fin and rudder. The dorsal turret was changed to a four-gun Boulton Paul Type A Mk.VIII, and there were improvements to the bomb bay door sealing. Some aircraft were fitted with the H2S radar.
;Halifax B.II Series I, Freighter
:A few Mk.IIs were employed in the transport role in Great Britain (unmodified SOE-aircraft) and in the Middle East (simple modifications to allow carriage of engines or Spitfire fuselages).
;Halifax B.II Series II
:Single aircraft (HR756) modified with three-blade Rotol propellers and Merlin 22 engines. Rejected in favour of Mk.III.
;Halifax A.II
:According to some sources, a handful of the airborne forces Halifaxes were converted into B.IIs. If this is true they might have been designated A.II or may have retained their bomber designations.
;Halifax GR.II
:Coastal Command variant of the Halifax B.II.
;Halifax GR.II Series I
:A handful of aircraft converted from Series I or Special to GR.II standard, having differences in dorsal armament. The main difference was the fitting of a ASV.Mk 3 radar in an H2S type fairing. Sometimes, a machine gun was fitted in the faired nose.
;Halifax GR.II Series IA
:Definitive Coastal Command variant of the GR.II with glazed nose mounting machine gun, Merlin XX or 22 engines, B-P A-type dorsal turret and extra long-range fuel tanks in fuselage. A ventral turret with a single machine gun was mounted on most aircraft although some employed the ASV.Mk 3 radar in its place.
;Halifax Met.II
:Some sources suggest that there were a meteorological variant of the B.II, designated Met.II, but this is unlikely.

===H.P.61===

;Halifax B.III
:Main production variant, fitted with Bristol Hercules engines. B.III bombers were fitted with transparent nose dome with single machine gun, Boulton Paul dorsal turret with four guns and tail turret with four guns. All but first few had longer wing with rounded wingtips that increased wingspan to 104 ft 2 in (31.75 m). 2,091 produced.

==Surviving aircraft==
Of the 6,176 Halifaxes built, three complete examples remain.
=== Recovery of Halifax wrecks ===
Halifax NA337 and LW682A have been recovered by a Canadian group, Halifax 57 Rescue. Halifax NA337 was recovered in 1995 from under Lake Mjøsa, Norway before being restored at the National Air Force Museum of Canada in Trenton, Ontario. In 1997, LW682 was recovered from a bog near Geraardsbergen, Belgium. Halifax 57 Rescue was also involved the recovery and subsequent burial of three crew members. Parts were used to restore NA337, and the rest was melted down for the London RAF Bomber Command Memorial.

, Halifax 57 Rescue were also looking to recover two more aircraft, HR871 near Sweden, and LW170 near Scotland. Once recovered, the plan is for HR871 to be moved to the Nanton, Alberta Bomber Command Museum of Canada for restoration.

<text>Pontypool ( ) is a town and the administrative centre of the county borough of Torfaen, within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire in South Wales. , it has a population of 29,062.

==Location==
It is situated on the Afon Lwyd river in the county borough of Torfaen. Located at the eastern edge of the South Wales coalfields, Pontypool grew around industries including iron and steel production, coal mining, and the growth of the railways. A rather artistic manufacturing industry which also flourished here alongside heavy industry was Japanning, a type of lacquer ware.

Pontypool covers several areas, hamlets, villages and towns including New Inn, Griffithstown, Sebastopol (Panteg.) Abersychan, Cwmffrwdoer, Pontnewynydd, Trevethin, Penygarn, Wainfelin, Tranch, Brynwern, Pontymoile, Blaendare, Cwmynyscoy, Talywain, Garndiffaith, Pentwyn, and Varteg.

==History==

The name of the town in Welsh – &quot;Pont-y-pŵl&quot; – originates from a bridge (&#x27;pont&#x27;) associated with a pool in the Afon Lwyd. The Welsh word &quot;pŵl&quot; is a borrowing from English &quot;pool&quot; and is found in other place-names in Gwent. &quot;Pontypool&quot; is an anglicised form of the Welsh name.

Pontypool has a notable history as one of the earliest industrial towns in Wales. The town and its immediate surroundings were home to significant industrial and technological innovations, with links to the iron industry dating back to the early fifteenth century when a bloomery furnace was established at Pontymoile. During the sixteenth century, largely due to the influence of the Hanbury family, the area developed its association with the iron industry and continued to consolidate its position in the seventeenth century, when the development of the town began in earnest. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the metallurgical and extractive industries of the area, along with the development of the canals and railways, provided the impetus to the expansion of Pontypool and its surrounding villages and communities.

===Industrial development===
The Afon Lwyd valley, in which Pontypool is situated, provided an abundance of resources for the manufacturing of iron, including coal, iron ore, charcoal and waterpower. The wider technological developments of the Tudor period, such as the utilisation of blast furnaces to produce iron, allowed for the greater exploitation of the mineral resources of south Wales. A blast furnace was in use at Monkswood, near Pontypool, from as early as 1536 and was followed by the erection of other blast furnaces in the area surrounding Pontypool. An ironworks was established in what later became Pontypool Park in c. 1575. Forges, where cast iron could be converted into wrought iron, were also developed and included Town Forge within Pontypool, which was in operation during the last quarter of the sixteenth century, and the Osborne Forge, near Pontnewynydd, which produced the renowned Osmond iron.

Richard Hanbury of Worcestershire, a notable entrepreneur, developed interests within the Pontypool area during the 1570s, acquiring and developing forges and furnaces in Monkswood, Cwmffrwdoer, Trosnant, Llanelly and Abercarn. Hanbury acquired leases and rights to utilise the raw materials of the wider area, including a large expanse of woodland to produce charcoal and some 800 acres of land to extract coal and iron-ore at Panteg, Pontymoile and Mynyddislwyn. Furthermore, he secured the rights to extract coal and iron-ore on Lord Abergavenny&#x27;s Hills in and around Blaenavon. The Hanburys were also active at Cwmlickey, Lower Race and Blaendare during the seventeenth century as the demand for coal was met.

Major John Hanbury (1664–1734) acquired a reputation as an industrial pioneer and through the endeavours of Hanbury and his leading agents, Thomas Cooke, William Payne and Thomas Allgood, significant developments within the British tinplate industry were made in Pontypool, including the introduction of the world&#x27;s first rolling for the production of iron sheets and blackplate at the Pontypool Park works in 1697. Tinplate was being produced at Pontypool from c. 1706, with an important tin mill in operation at Pontymoile during the early eighteenth century.

During the 1660s, Thomas Allgood of Northamptonshire, was appointed manager of the Pontypool Ironworks. Allgood developed the Pontypool &#x27;japanning&#x27; process, whereby metal plate could be treated in a way that generated a lacquered and decorative finish. Thomas Allgood died in 1716, having been unable to commence production of his Pontypool Japanware but the increased creation of tinplate at Pontypool from the early eighteenth century allowed for japanning to enter wide scale manufacture. There was a growing demand for these artistic, luxury products and Allgood&#x27;s sons, Edward and Thomas, established a japanworks in Pontypool, which was producing large quantities of Japanware by 1732. The brothers produced a range of products, including decorative bread baskets, tea trays, dishes and other items, and were renowned for their high quality work. Following the death of Edward Allgood in 1761 there was a family quarrel between his two sons and a rival japanning factory was established in Usk. Both the Pontypool and Usk concerns had ceased production by the early 1820s.

From the mid to late eighteenth century, as the industrial revolution took hold, there was a massive expansion in the economic development of south Wales. Iron-making flourished in emerging towns and settlements, notably at Merthyr Tydfil, Tredegar, and Blaenavon. By the early nineteenth century, south Wales was the most important centre of iron production in the world. Whilst Pontypool was not as competitive as some of the larger ironworks towns, it retained a niche in the metallurgical market, producing specialist tinplate. The japanning industry of Pontypool continued to decline and had ceased by the mid-nineteenth century, by which time the economy of the Pontypool area relied on the iron and coal industries, the tinplate industry and the production of iron rails. The twentieth century witnessed a decline in the heavy industries of south Wales and this had a direct impact on the economy of Pontypool and its district.

===Urban and civic development===

The growth of Pontypool accompanied the development of industry. Originally a dispersed, rural settlement, the first centres of growth took place in the hamlets of Trosnant and Pontymoile. However, as the focus of industry and investment became increasingly centred on Pontypool, the town began to emerge as a focal point for the wider, scattered community.

Pontypool was a little village within old Trevethin parish in the ancient hundred of Abergavenny of the County of Monmouth. In 1690, during the reign of William III and Mary II, the Crown accepted a petition for a market to be established in Pontypool, permitting a weekly market and three annual fairs—the village thus officially became a town. A market hall and assembly rooms were erected in 1730–31, thereby elevating the civic position of the community. During the early eighteenth century, the Hanbury family were also developing their Pontypool Park estate as a permanent family residence. The development of industrial works and employment opportunities near the emerging town also precipitated the building of dwellings along the Afon Lwyd to provide housing for the workforce. Trade and commerce also developed and Pontypool, largely due to the endeavours of the Vaughan family, acquired a strong reputation for clock-making during the eighteenth century. By the middle of the eighteenth century, a small town had clearly developed, providing employment, housing and a commercial role, also serving as an important local centre for the surrounding hamlets. By the time Archdeacon William Coxe visited Pontypool at the dawn of the nineteenth century, the town had some 250 houses and a number of thriving shops and businesses, catering for a population of approximately 1,500 people.

Pontypool continued to grow during the nineteenth century, with many new houses and buildings being erected during the late Victorian period. Concurrently, the outlying villages also grew, effectively providing suburbs to Pontypool town centre. Key civic and community buildings were created during the course of the century, including an abundance of chapels and churches, Pontypool Town Hall, which was provided by Capel Hanbury Leigh in 1856, and a great number of shops, banks, public houses, hotels and a public library from 1906.

The town also developed an important educational role. Pontypool became home to a Welsh Baptist College in 1836, when it moved from Abergavenny. The college trained many Welsh Baptist ministers, large numbers of whom went on to lead congregations in Wales and overseas. It relocated to the new University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, in Cardiff, in 1893. The former Pontypool College became the County Grammar School for Girls in 1897 and, in the following January, West Monmouth Grammar School was opened for boys. The school&#x27;s origins date back to the early seventeenth century when William Jones, a wealthy merchant, left a considerable fortune to the Company of Haberdashers to provide charitable and educational services in Monmouth. Monmouth School was built in 1615 and many years later, the trustees of the charity decided to invest in additional schools within the county. &#x27;West Mon&#x27; School was consequently built, at a cost of £30,000, on a site donated by John Capel Hanbury in 1896.

Urban growth continued in the twentieth century as national social reforms encouraged the provision of public housing schemes to improve the quality of housing in working class communities. Redevelopment programmes in the latter half of the century resulted in the demolition of old streets and historic buildings, as well as the creation of new road networks to relieve the increased pressure of vehicular traffic.

===Transport===
The industries of the area necessitated good transport links. A network of tramroads was established throughout the Pontypool area to connect sites of extraction to the centres of the production and subsequently to export, and market routes. The construction of the Monmouthshire Canal during the 1790s connected Pontnewynydd to Newport and later connected with the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal at Pontymoile in 1812. Tramroads leading from industrial areas within an eight-mile radius of the canal converged at either Pontnewynydd or Pontymoile.

The tramroads and canals were superseded by the railways in the mid-nineteenth century. From 1845, work commenced on establishing a railway from Pontypool to Newport. The line opened to passengers in 1852 and connected with Blaenavon in 1854. It eventually came under the management of the Great Western Railway. Another line was constructed during the 1860s and 1870s to connect Pontypool with Newport via Caerleon. Connections were also made with Abergavenny, Hereford and the Taff Vale. Pontypool had three railway stations, namely Crane Street, Clarence Street and Pontypool Road. Line closures during the 1960s greatly reduced the valley&#x27;s railway connections, which were replaced by modern roads. The only passenger line still operating within Pontypool is at an unmanned station in New Inn. Pontypool &amp; New Inn station is on the Welsh Marches Line with trains provided by Transport for Wales.

===Pontypool Park===
Pontypool Park was the historic seat of the Hanbury family, who developed a permanent residence in Pontypool in c. 1694 and, under the direction of Major John Hanbury, subsequently established a deer park in the early 1700s. The park became a venue for recreation and enjoyment for the Hanbury family and their associates. An example of the luxury and display demonstrated by the family is the ornate shell grotto summerhouse within the park, completed and decorated during the 1830s.

Pontypool Park House was gradually extended and modified, with major changes being carried out in the mid-18th century, the early 1800s and 1872. Alterations were also made within Pontypool Park during the 19th century and included the dismantling of the old ironworks in 1831, the reconstruction of the park gates by Thomas Deakin of Blaenavon in 1835, the planting of trees to increase the privacy of the family from the gaze of outsiders, and the development of the American Gardens in 1851.
In 1920, the house and its park entered public ownership, and this allowed for the site to be developed as a public amenity. Developments during the 1920s witnessed the introduction of public tennis courts, a rugby ground and a bowling green. A notable event was the Royal National Eisteddfod, which took place in the park in 1924. A bandstand was added in 1931, allowing the townspeople the opportunity to listen to music in the open air. A leisure centre and artificial ski slope were introduced in 1974.

Pontypool Park House was sold to the Sisters of the Order of the Holy Ghost in 1923, who utilised the building as a girls&#x27; boarding school. It eventually became St. Alban&#x27;s R.C. High School. The adjacent stable block was used for a variety of purposes during the 20th century but ultimately became home to the Valley Inheritance Museum in 1981, which was set up by Torfaen Museum Trust (est. 1978) to accommodate, safeguard and present the collections relating to the heritage of the Afon Lwyd valley.

==Education==
The town is home to four comprehensive schools:
Abersychan School; West Monmouth School (formerly Jones&#x27; West Monmouth Grammar School for Boys); St. Alban&#x27;s R.C. High School; and Ysgol Gymraeg Gwynllyw, a Welsh Medium education school teaching students between 3 and 19 years old.

Trevethin Community School was closed at the end of the 2007 academic year. This was formerly the Pontypool Grammar School for Girls (also known as &#x27;The County&#x27;), although at one time the sole campus was where the Welsh medium school, Ysgol Gymraeg Gwynllyw now stands. Trevethin Community School was also the original site of the Welsh Baptist College. 

Having been kept open as a vaccination center during the initial COVID outbreak of 2020, Pontypool Campus Coleg Gwent (formerly known as Pontypool College) permanently closed in 2023. The local borough council is now considering the former campus a potential housing site.

Crownbridge Special School was based in Pontypool; however, in 2012, the school moved to new facilities in Cwmbran.

==Sport and leisure==

Pontypool Active Living Centre, in Pontypool Park is a leisure centre with the only swimming venue in Pontypool. It has a 25-metre swimming pool for competitive swimming galas and viewing for up to 200 spectators. It also has a separate teaching pool and two hydroslides. Pontypool Active Living Centre has a fitness suite. As well as a dance studio, and sports hall.

Pontypool Park is also home to Wales&#x27; oldest and longest artificial ski slope. Built in 1974 and at 230m long it is used for leisure and by the Welsh Ski Squad for training. The ski slope is closed for part of the year due to local council funding cutbacks.

In the grounds of Pontypool Park there is a play park for children and a skate park. As well as a picnic area, and outdoor tennis courts. 

Pontypool RFC’s rugby ground is situated in Pontypool Park grounds. 

Pontypool has a Brass Band.

===Rugby===
Pontypool Rugby Football Club is one of the town&#x27;s cornerstones. Founded in the 1870s, the club became a founder member of the Welsh Rugby Union in 1881. Under the captaincy of Terry Cobner the intervening years saw &#x27;Pooler&#x27; become one of the great teams of Welsh rugby. The legendary &#x27;Pontypool Front Row&#x27; in the 1970s, of Bobby Windsor, Charlie Faulkner and Graham Price was immortalised in song by Max Boyce. The club&#x27;s contribution to Wales was seen again in 1983, when Pontypool&#x27;s &quot;forward factory&quot; produced five of the Welsh pack in the Five Nations Championship. Other rugby union clubs based in or near the town are Pontypool United RFC, Abersychan RFC, Garndiffaith RFC, New Panteg RFC, Talywain RFC, West Mon RFC, Blaenavon RFC and Forgeside RFC. Pontypool&#x27;s rugby league club are called the Torfaen Tigers and play in the Rugby League Conference Welsh Premier.

<text>The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets only tens of meters across to the enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. There are 146 moons with confirmed orbits, the most of any planet in the Solar System. This number does not include the many thousands of moonlets embedded within Saturn&#x27;s dense rings, nor hundreds of possible kilometer-sized distant moons that have been observed on single occasions. Seven Saturnian moons are large enough to have collapsed into a relaxed, ellipsoidal shape, though only one or two of those, Titan and possibly Rhea, are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium. Three moons are particularly notable. Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System (after Jupiter&#x27;s Ganymede), with a nitrogen-rich Earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring river networks and hydrocarbon lakes. Enceladus emits jets of ice from its south-polar region and is covered in a deep layer of snow. Iapetus has contrasting black and white hemispheres as well as an extensive ridge of equatorial mountains among the tallest in the solar system.

Twenty-four of the known moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn&#x27;s equatorial plane, with the exception of Iapetus which has a prograde but highly inclined orbit, an unusual characteristic for a regular moon. They include the seven major satellites, four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons, and five that act as shepherd moons, of which two are mutually co-orbital. Two tiny moons orbit inside of Saturn&#x27;s B and G rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in an orbital resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edges of the dense A Ring and the narrow F Ring, and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.

The remaining 122, with mean diameters ranging from , orbit much farther from Saturn. They are irregular satellites, having high orbital inclinations and eccentricities mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or fragments from the collisional breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. Saturn is expected to have around 150 irregular satellites larger than in diameter, plus many hundreds more that are even smaller. The irregular satellites are classified by their orbital characteristics into the prograde Inuit and Gallic groups and the large retrograde Norse group, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies (with the Gallic group corresponding to Celtic mythology). The sole exception is Phoebe, the largest irregular Saturnian moon, discovered at the end of the 19th century; it is part of the Norse group but named for a Greek Titaness.

The rings of Saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn. Thus an absolute number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no consensus on a boundary between the countless small unnamed objects that form Saturn&#x27;s ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. Over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.

, there are 83 designated moons that are still unnamed; all but one (the designated B-ring moonlet S/2009 S 1) are irregular. (There are many other undesignated ring moonlets.) If named, most of the irregulars will receive names from Gallic, Norse and Inuit mythology based on the orbital group of which they are a member.

==Discovery==
===Early observations===
Before the advent of telescopic photography, eight moons of Saturn were discovered by direct observation using optical telescopes. Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan, was discovered in 1655 by Christiaan Huygens using a objective lens on a refracting telescope of his own design. Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus (the &quot;Sidera Lodoicea&quot;) were discovered between 1671 and 1684 by Giovanni Domenico Cassini. Mimas and Enceladus were discovered in 1789 by William Herschel. Hyperion was discovered in 1848 by W. C. Bond, G. P. Bond and William Lassell.

The use of long-exposure photographic plates made possible the discovery of additional moons. The first to be discovered in this manner, Phoebe, was found in 1899 by W. H. Pickering. In 1966 the tenth satellite of Saturn was discovered by Audouin Dollfus, when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox. It was later named Janus. A few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present and that it had an orbit similar to that of Janus. This object is now known as Epimetheus, the eleventh moon of Saturn. It shares the same orbit with Janus—the only known example of co-orbitals in the Solar System. In 1980, three additional Saturnian moons were discovered from the ground and later confirmed by the &quot;Voyager&quot; probes. They are trojan moons of Dione (Helene) and Tethys (Telesto and Calypso).

===Observations by spacecraft===
The study of the outer planets has since been revolutionized by the use of uncrewed space probes. The arrival of the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft at Saturn in 1980–1981 resulted in the discovery of three additional moons—Atlas, Prometheus and Pandora—bringing the total to 17. In addition, Epimetheus was confirmed as distinct from Janus. In 1990, Pan was discovered in archival &quot;Voyager&quot; images.

The &quot;Cassini&quot; mission, which arrived at Saturn in July 2004, initially discovered three small inner moons: Methone and Pallene between Mimas and Enceladus, and the second trojan moon of Dione, Polydeuces. It also observed three suspected but unconfirmed moons in the F Ring. In Cassini scientists announced that the structure of Saturn&#x27;s rings indicates the presence of several more moons orbiting within the rings, although only one, Daphnis, had been visually confirmed at the time. In 2007 Anthe was announced. In 2008 it was reported that &quot;Cassini&quot; observations of a depletion of energetic electrons in Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere near Rhea might be the signature of a tenuous ring system around Saturn&#x27;s second largest moon. In , Aegaeon, a moonlet within the G Ring, was announced. In July of the same year, S/2009 S 1, the first moonlet within the B Ring, was observed. In April 2014, the possible beginning of a new moon, within the A Ring, was reported. (related image)

===Outer moons===

Study of Saturn&#x27;s moons has also been aided by advances in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates. For the 20th century, Phoebe stood alone among Saturn&#x27;s known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Then in 2000, three dozen additional irregular moons were discovered using ground-based telescopes. A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic. They are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn&#x27;s gravitational pull. In 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons, in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2 m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons, in , Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May of the same year S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported. In 2019, twenty new irregular satellites of Saturn were reported, resulting in Saturn overtaking Jupiter as the planet with the most known moons for the first time since 2000.

In 2019, researchers Edward Ashton, Brett Gladman, and Matthew Beaudoin conducted a survey of Saturn&#x27;s Hill sphere using the 3.6-meter Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope and discovered about 80 new Saturnian irregular moons. Follow-up observations of these new moons took place over 2019–2021, eventually leading to S/2019 S 1 being announced in November 2021 and an additional 62 moons being announced from 3–16 May 2023. These discoveries brought Saturn&#x27;s total number of confirmed moons up to 145, making it the first planet known to have over 100 moons. Yet another moon, S/2006 S 20, was announced on 23 May 2023, bringing Saturn&#x27;s total count moons to 146. All of these new moons are small and faint, with diameters over and apparent magnitudes of 25–27. The researchers found that the Saturnian irregular moon population is more abundant at smaller sizes, suggesting that they are likely fragments from a collision that occurred a few hundred million years ago. The researchers extrapolated that the true population of Saturnian irregular moons larger than in diameter amounts to , which is approximately three times as many Jovian irregular moons down to the same size. If this size distribution applies to even smaller diameters, Saturn would therefore intrinsically have more irregular moons than Jupiter.

==Naming==

The modern names for Saturnian moons were suggested by John Herschel in 1847. He proposed to name them after mythological figures associated with the Roman god of agriculture and harvest, Saturn (equated to the Greek Cronus). In particular, the then known seven satellites were named after Titans, Titanesses and Giants – brothers and sisters of Cronus. The idea was similar to Simon Marius&#x27; mythological naming scheme for the moons of Jupiter.
As Saturn devoured his children, his family could not be assembled around him, so that the choice lay among his brothers and sister, the Titans and Titanesses. The name &quot;Iapetus&quot; seemed indicated by the obscurity and remoteness of the exterior satellite, &quot;Titan&quot; by the superior size of the Huyghenian, while the three female appellations [&quot;Rhea&quot;, &quot;Dione&quot;, and &quot;Tethys&quot;] class together the three intermediate Cassinian satellites. The minute interior ones seemed appropriately characterized by a return to male appellations [&quot;Enceladus&quot; and &quot;Mimas&quot;] chosen from a younger and inferior (though still superhuman) brood. [&quot;Results of the Astronomical Observations made ... at the Cape of Good Hope&quot;, p. 415]

In 1848, Lassell proposed that the eighth satellite of Saturn be named Hyperion after another Titan. When in the 20th century the names of Titans were exhausted, the moons were named after different characters of the Greco-Roman mythology or giants from other mythologies. All the irregular moons (except Phoebe, discovered about a century before the others) are named after Inuit, and Gallic gods, and after Norse ice giants.

Some asteroids share the same names as moons of Saturn: 55 Pandora, 106 Dione, 577 Rhea, 1809 Prometheus, 1810 Epimetheus, and 4450 Pan. In addition, three more asteroids would share the names of Saturnian moons but for spelling differences made permanent by the International Astronomical Union (IAU): Calypso and asteroid 53 Kalypso; Helene and asteroid 101 Helena; and Gunnlod and asteroid 657 Gunlöd.

==Physical characteristics==
Saturn&#x27;s satellite system is very lopsided: one moon, Titan, comprises more than 96% of the mass in orbit around the planet. The six other planemo (ellipsoidal) moons constitute roughly 4% of the mass, and the remaining small moons, together with the rings, comprise only 0.04%.

==Orbital groups==
Although the boundaries may be somewhat vague, Saturn&#x27;s moons can be divided into ten groups according to their orbital characteristics. Many of them, such as Pan and Daphnis, orbit within Saturn&#x27;s ring system and have orbital periods only slightly longer than the planet&#x27;s rotation period. The innermost moons and most regular satellites all have mean orbital inclinations ranging from less than a degree to about 1.5 degrees (except Iapetus, which has an inclination of 7.57 degrees) and small orbital eccentricities. On the other hand, irregular satellites in the outermost regions of Saturn&#x27;s moon system, in particular the Norse group, have orbital radii of millions of kilometers and orbital periods lasting several years. The moons of the Norse group also orbit in the opposite direction to Saturn&#x27;s rotation.

=== Inner moons ===

==== Ring moonlets ====

During late July 2009, a moonlet, S/2009 S 1, was discovered in the B Ring, 480 km from the outer edge of the ring, by the shadow it cast. It is estimated to be 300 m in diameter. Unlike the A Ring moonlets (see below), it does not induce a &#x27;propeller&#x27; feature, probably due to the density of the B Ring.

In 2006, four tiny moonlets were found in &quot;Cassini&quot; images of the A Ring. Before this discovery only two larger moons had been known within gaps in the A Ring: Pan and Daphnis. These are large enough to clear continuous gaps in the ring. In contrast, a moonlet is only massive enough to clear two small—about 10 km across—partial gaps in the immediate vicinity of the moonlet itself creating a structure shaped like an airplane propeller. The moonlets themselves are tiny, ranging from about 40 to 500 meters in diameter, and are too small to be seen directly.
In 2007, the discovery of 150 more moonlets revealed that they (with the exception of two that have been seen outside the Encke gap) are confined to three narrow bands in the A Ring between 126,750 and 132,000 km from Saturn&#x27;s center. Each band is about a thousand kilometers wide, which is less than 1% the width of Saturn&#x27;s rings. This region is relatively free from the disturbances caused by resonances with larger satellites, although other areas of the A Ring without disturbances are apparently free of moonlets. The moonlets were probably formed from the breakup of a larger satellite. It is estimated that the A Ring contains 7,000–8,000 propellers larger than 0.8 km in size and millions larger than 0.25 km. In April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible consolidation of a new moon within the A Ring, implying that Saturn&#x27;s present moons may have formed in a similar process in the past when Saturn&#x27;s ring system was much more massive.

Similar moonlets may reside in the F Ring. There, &quot;jets&quot; of material may be due to collisions, initiated by perturbations from the nearby small moon Prometheus, of these moonlets with the core of the F Ring. One of the largest F Ring moonlets may be the as-yet unconfirmed object S/2004 S 6. The F Ring also contains transient &quot;fans&quot; which are thought to result from even smaller moonlets, about 1 km in diameter, orbiting near the F Ring core.

One recently discovered moon, Aegaeon, resides within the bright arc of G Ring and is trapped in the 7:6 mean-motion resonance with Mimas. This means that it makes exactly seven revolutions around Saturn while Mimas makes exactly six. The moon is the largest among the population of bodies that are sources of dust in this ring.

==== Ring shepherds ====
Shepherd satellites are small moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet&#x27;s ring system. They have the effect of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn&#x27;s shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Prometheus (F Ring), Janus (A Ring), and Epimetheus (A Ring). These moons probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present-day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.

Janus and Epimetheus are co-orbital moons. They are of similar size, with Janus being somewhat larger than Epimetheus. They have orbits with less than a 100-kilometer difference in semi-major axis, close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other. Instead of colliding, their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.
==== Other inner moons ====
Other inner moons that are neither ring shepherds nor ring moonlets include Atlas and Pandora.

===Inner large===
The innermost large moons of Saturn orbit within its tenuous E Ring, along with three smaller moons of the Alkyonides group.
* Mimas is the smallest and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20 km) by the effects of Saturn&#x27;s gravity. Mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on its leading hemisphere Mimas has no known past or present geologic activity and its surface is dominated by impact craters, though it does have a water ocean 20–30 km beneath the surface. The only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear troughs, which probably formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact. 
* Enceladus is one of the smallest of Saturn&#x27;s moons that is spherical in shape—only Mimas is smaller—yet is the only small Saturnian moon that is currently endogenously active, and the smallest known body in the Solar System that is geologically active today. Its surface is morphologically diverse; it includes ancient heavily cratered terrain as well as younger smooth areas with few impact craters. Many plains on Enceladus are fractured and intersected by systems of lineaments. The area around its south pole was found by &quot;Cassini&quot; to be unusually warm and cut by a system of fractures about 130 km long called &quot;tiger stripes&quot;, some of which emit jets of water vapor and dust. These jets form a large plume off its south pole, which replenishes Saturn&#x27;s E ring and serves as the main source of ions in the magnetosphere of Saturn. The gas and dust are released with a rate of more than 100 kg/s. Enceladus may have liquid water underneath the south-polar surface. The source of the energy for this cryovolcanism is thought to be a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Dione. The pure ice on the surface makes Enceladus one of the brightest known objects in the Solar System—its geometrical albedo is more than 140%.
* Tethys is the third largest of Saturn&#x27;s inner moons. Its most prominent features are a large (400 km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on its leading hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies the majority of its surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985 g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with only a small fraction of rock.
* Dione is the second-largest inner moon of Saturn. It has a higher density than the geologically dead Rhea, the largest inner moon, but lower than that of active Enceladus. While the majority of Dione&#x27;s surface is heavily cratered old terrain, this moon is also covered with an extensive network of troughs and lineaments, indicating that in the past it had global tectonic activity. The troughs and lineaments are especially prominent on the trailing hemisphere, where several intersecting sets of fractures form what is called &quot;wispy terrain&quot;. The cratered plains have a few large impact craters reaching 250 km in diameter. Smooth plains with low impact-crater counts are also present on a small fraction of its surface. They were probably tectonically resurfaced relatively later in the geological history of Dione. At two locations within smooth plains strange landforms (depressions) resembling oblong impact craters have been identified, both of which lie at the centers of radiating networks of cracks and troughs; these features may be cryovolcanic in origin. Dione may be geologically active even now, although on a scale much smaller than the cryovolcanism of Enceladus. This follows from Cassini magnetic measurements that show Dione is a net source of plasma in the magnetosphere of Saturn, much like Enceladus.

===Alkyonides===
Three small moons orbit between Mimas and Enceladus: Methone, Anthe, and Pallene. Named after the Alkyonides of Greek mythology, they are some of the smallest moons in the Saturn system. Anthe and Methone have very faint ring arcs along their orbits, whereas Pallene has a faint complete ring. Of these three moons, only Methone has been photographed at close range, showing it to be egg-shaped with very few or no craters.

===Trojan===

Trojan moons are a unique feature only known from the Saturnian system. A trojan body orbits at either the leading L4 or trailing L5 Lagrange point of a much larger object, such as a large moon or planet. Tethys has two trojan moons, Telesto (leading) and Calypso (trailing), and Dione also has two, Helene (leading) and Polydeuces (trailing). Helene is by far the largest trojan moon, while Polydeuces is the smallest and has the most chaotic orbit. These moons are coated with dusty material that has smoothed out their surfaces.

===Outer large===
These moons all orbit beyond the E Ring. They are:
* Rhea is the second-largest of Saturn&#x27;s moons. It is even slightly larger than Oberon, the second-largest moon of Uranus. In 2005, &quot;Cassini&quot; detected a depletion of electrons in the plasma wake of Rhea, which forms when the co-rotating plasma of Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere is absorbed by the moon. The depletion was hypothesized to be caused by the presence of dust-sized particles concentrated in a few faint equatorial rings. Such a ring system would make Rhea the only moon in the Solar System known to have rings. Subsequent targeted observations of the putative ring plane from several angles by &quot;Cassini&quot;&#x27;s narrow-angle camera turned up no evidence of the expected ring material, leaving the origin of the plasma observations unresolved. Otherwise Rhea has rather a typical heavily cratered surface, with the exceptions of a few large Dione-type fractures (wispy terrain) on the trailing hemisphere and a very faint &quot;line&quot; of material at the equator that may have been deposited by material deorbiting from present or former rings. Rhea also has two very large impact basins on its anti-Saturnian hemisphere, which are about 400 and 500 km across. The first, Tirawa, is roughly comparable to the Odysseus basin on Tethys. There is also a 48 km-diameter impact crater called Inktomi at 112°W that is prominent because of an extended system of bright rays, which may be one of the youngest craters on the inner moons of Saturn. No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered on the surface of Rhea.
* Titan, at 5,149 km diameter, is the second largest moon in the Solar System and Saturn&#x27;s largest. Out of all the large moons, Titan is the only one with a dense (surface pressure of 1.5 atm), cold atmosphere, primarily made of nitrogen with a small fraction of methane. The dense atmosphere frequently produces bright white convective clouds, especially over the south pole region. On 6 June 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan. On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. The surface of Titan, which is difficult to observe due to persistent atmospheric haze, shows only a few impact craters and is probably very young. It contains a pattern of light and dark regions, flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos. Some dark regions are covered by longitudinal dune fields shaped by tidal winds, where sand is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan&#x27;s north and south polar regions. The largest lake, Kraken Mare, is larger than the Caspian Sea. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt to the surface of the moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On 2 July 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be &quot;as salty as the Earth&#x27;s Dead Sea&quot;.
* Hyperion is Titan&#x27;s nearest neighbor in the Saturn system. The two moons are locked in a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270 km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55 g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10 km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis at a rate of 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its axis of rotation (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.
* Iapetus is the third-largest of Saturn&#x27;s moons. Orbiting the planet at km, it is by far the most distant of Saturn&#x27;s large moons, and also has the largest orbital inclination, at 15.47°. Iapetus has long been known for its unusual two-toned surface; its leading hemisphere is pitch-black and its trailing hemisphere is almost as bright as fresh snow. &quot;Cassini&quot; images showed that the dark material is confined to a large near-equatorial area on the leading hemisphere called Cassini Regio, which extends approximately from 40°N to 40°S. The pole regions of Iapetus are as bright as its trailing hemisphere. &quot;Cassini&quot; also discovered a 20 km tall equatorial ridge, which spans nearly the moon&#x27;s entire equator. Otherwise both dark and bright surfaces of Iapetus are old and heavily cratered. The images revealed at least four large impact basins with diameters from 380 to 550 km and numerous smaller impact craters. No evidence of any endogenic activity has been discovered. A clue to the origin of the dark material covering part of Iapetus&#x27;s starkly dichromatic surface may have been found in 2009, when NASA&#x27;s Spitzer Space Telescope discovered a vast, nearly invisible disk around Saturn, just inside the orbit of the moon Phoebe – the Phoebe ring. Scientists believe that the disk originates from dust and ice particles kicked up by impacts on Phoebe. Because the disk particles, like Phoebe itself, orbit in the opposite direction to Iapetus, Iapetus collides with them as they drift in the direction of Saturn, darkening its leading hemisphere slightly. Once a difference in albedo, and hence in average temperature, was established between different regions of Iapetus, a thermal runaway process of water ice sublimation from warmer regions and deposition of water vapor onto colder regions ensued. Iapetus&#x27;s present two-toned appearance results from the contrast between the bright, primarily ice-coated areas and regions of dark lag, the residue left behind after the loss of surface ice.

===Irregular===

Irregular moons are small satellites with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, believed to have been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.

====Inuit====

The Inuit group includes thirteen prograde outer moons that are similar enough in their distances from the planet (190–300 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclinations (45–50°) and their colors that they can be considered a group. The Inuit group is further split into three distinct subgroups at different semi-major axes, and are named after their respective largest members. Ordered by increasing semi-major axis, these subgroups are the Kiviuq group, the Paaliaq group, and the Siarnaq group. The Kiviuq group includes five members: Kiviuq, Ijiraq, S/2005 S 4, S/2019 S 1, and S/2020 S 1. The Siarnaq group includes seven members: Siarnaq, Tarqeq, S/2004 S 31, S/2019 S 14, S/2020 S 3, S/2019 S 6, and S/2020 S 5. In contrast to the Kiviuq and Siarnaq subgroups, the Paaliaq subgroup does not contain any other known members besides Paaliaq itself. Of the entire Inuit group, Siarnaq is the largest member with an estimated size of about 39 km.

====Gallic====

The Gallic group includes seven prograde outer moons that are similar enough in their distance from the planet (200–300 radii of Saturn), their orbital inclination (35–40°) and their color that they can be considered a group. They are Albiorix, Bebhionn, Erriapus, Tarvos, Saturn LX, S/2007 S 8, and S/2020 S 4. The largest of these moons is Albiorix with an estimated diameter of about 29 km.

====Norse====
All 100 retrograde outer moons of Saturn are broadly classified into the Norse group. They are Aegir, Angrboda, Alvaldi, Beli, Bergelmir, Bestla, Eggther, Farbauti, Fenrir, Fornjot, Geirrod, Gerd, Greip, Gridr, Gunnlod, Hati, Hyrrokkin, Jarnsaxa, Kari, Loge, Mundilfari, Narvi, Phoebe, Skathi, Skoll, Skrymir, Surtur, Suttungr, Thiazzi, Thrymr, Ymir, and 69 unnamed satellites. After Phoebe, Ymir is the largest of the known retrograde irregular moons, with an estimated diameter of only 22 km.
* Phoebe, at in diameter, is by far the largest of Saturn&#x27;s irregular satellites. It has a retrograde orbit and rotates on its axis every 9.3 hours. Phoebe was the first moon of Saturn to be studied in detail by &quot;Cassini&quot;, in ; during this encounter &quot;Cassini&quot; was able to map nearly 90% of the moon&#x27;s surface. Phoebe has a nearly spherical shape and a relatively high density of about 1.6 g/cm3. &quot;Cassini&quot; images revealed a dark surface scarred by numerous impacts—there are about 130 craters with diameters exceeding 10 km. Such impacts may have ejected fragments of Phoebe into orbit around Saturn—two of these may be S/2006 S 20 and S/2006 S 9, whose orbits are similar to Phoebe. Spectroscopic measurement showed that the surface is made of water ice, carbon dioxide, phyllosilicates, organics and possibly iron-bearing minerals. Phoebe is believed to be a captured centaur that originated in the Kuiper belt. It also serves as a source of material for the largest known ring of Saturn, which darkens the leading hemisphere of Iapetus (see above).

====Outlier prograde satellites====
Two prograde moons of Saturn do not definitively belong to either the Inuit or Gallic groups. S/2004 S 24 and S/2006 S 12 have similar orbital inclinations as the Gallic group, but have much more distant orbits with semi-major axes of ~400 Saturn radii and ~340 Saturn radii, respectively.

==List==
=== Confirmed ===
The Saturnian moons are listed here by orbital period (or semi-major axis), from shortest to longest. Moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold and marked with a blue background, while the irregular moons are listed in red, orange, green, and gray background. The orbits and mean distances of the irregular moons are strongly variable over short timescales due to frequent planetary and solar perturbations, so the orbital elements of irregular moons listed here are averaged over a 5,000-year numerical integration by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. These may sometimes strongly differ from the osculating orbital elements provided by other sources. Their orbital elements are all based on a reference epoch of 1 January 2000.




===Unconfirmed===
These F Ring moonlets listed in the following table (observed by &quot;Cassini&quot;) have not been confirmed as solid bodies. It is not yet clear if these are real satellites or merely persistent clumps within the F Ring.

===Spurious===
Two moons were claimed to be discovered by different astronomers but never seen again. Both moons were said to orbit between Titan and Hyperion.
*Chiron which was supposedly sighted by Hermann Goldschmidt in 1861, but never observed by anyone else.
*Themis was allegedly discovered in 1905 by astronomer William Pickering, but never seen again. Nevertheless, it was included in numerous almanacs and astronomy books until the 1960s.

===Hypothetical===
In 2022, scientists of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology proposed the hypothetical former moon Chrysalis, using data from the Cassini–Huygens mission. Chrysalis would have orbited between Titan and Iapetus, but its orbit would have gradually become more eccentric until it was torn apart by Saturn. 99% of its mass would have been absorbed by Saturn, while the remaining 1% would have formed Saturn&#x27;s rings.

===Temporary===
Much like Jupiter, asteroids and comets will infrequently make close approaches to Saturn, even more infrequently becoming captured into orbit of the planet. The comet P/2020 F1 (Leonard) is calculated to have made a close approach of km ( mi) to Saturn on 8 May 1936, closer than the orbit of Titan to the planet, with an orbital eccentricity of only . The comet may have been orbiting Saturn prior to this as a temporary satellite, but difficulty modelling the non-gravitational forces makes whether or not it was indeed a temporary satellite uncertain.

Other comets and asteroids may have temporarily orbited Saturn at some point, but none are presently known to have.

==Formation==
It is thought that the Saturnian system of Titan, mid-sized moons, and rings developed from a set-up closer to the Galilean moons of Jupiter, though the details are unclear. It has been proposed either that a second Titan-sized moon broke up, producing the rings and inner mid-sized moons, or that two large moons fused to form Titan, with the collision scattering icy debris that formed the mid-sized moons. On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. Studies based on Enceladus&#x27;s tidal-based geologic activity and the lack of evidence of extensive past resonances in Tethys, Dione, and Rhea&#x27;s orbits suggest that the moons up to and including Rhea may be only 100 million years old.

<text>Pierre-Gilles de Gennes (; 24 October 1932 – 18 May 2007) was a French physicist and the Nobel Prize laureate in physics in 1991.

==Education and early life==
He was born in Paris, France, and was home-schooled to the age of 12. By the age of 13, he had adopted adult reading habits and was visiting museums.
Later, de Gennes studied at the École Normale Supérieure. After leaving the &quot;École&quot; in 1955, he became a research engineer at the Saclay center of the Commissariat à l&#x27;Énergie Atomique, working mainly on neutron scattering and magnetism, with advice from Anatole Abragam and Jacques Friedel. He defended his Ph.D. in 1957 at the University of Paris.

==Career and research==
In 1959, he was a postdoctoral research visitor with Charles Kittel at the University of California, Berkeley, and then spent 27 months in the French Navy. In 1961, he was assistant professor in Orsay and soon started the Orsay group on superconductors. In 1968, he switched to studying liquid crystals.

In 1971, he became professor at the Collège de France, and participated in STRASACOL (a joint action of Strasbourg, Saclay and &quot;Collège de France&quot;) on polymer physics. From 1980 on, he became interested in interfacial problems: the dynamics of wetting and adhesion.

He worked on granular materials and on the nature of memory objects in the brain.

==Awards and honours==
Awarded the Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize in 1968.

He was awarded the Harvey Prize, Lorentz Medal and Wolf Prize in 1988 and 1990. In 1991, he received the Nobel Prize in Physics. He was then director of the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris (ESPCI), a post he held from 1976 until his retirement in 2002.

P.G. de Gennes has also received the F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society in 1997, the Holweck Prize from the joint French and British Physical Society; the Ampere Prize, French Academy of Science; the gold medal from the French CNRS; the Matteuci Medal, Italian Academy; the Harvey Prize, Israel; and polymer awards from both APS and ACS.

He was awarded the above-mentioned Nobel Prize for discovering that &quot;methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers&quot;.

The Royal Society of Chemistry awards the De Gennes Prize biennially, in his honour. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1984. He was awarded A. Cemal Eringen Medal in 1998.

==Personal life==

He married Anne-Marie Rouet (born in 1933) in June 1954. They remained married until his death and had three children together: Christian (born 9 December 1954), Dominique (born 6 May 1956) and Marie-Christine (born 11 January 1958).

He also has four children with physicist Françoise Brochard-Wyart (born in 1944) who was one of his former doctoral students and then colleague and co-author. The children are: Claire Wyart (born 16 February 1977), Matthieu Wyart (born 24 May 1978), Olivier Wyart (born 3 August 1984) and Marc de Gennes (born 16 January 1991).

Professors John Goodby and George Gray noted in an obituary: &quot;Pierre was a man of great charm and humour, capable of making others believe they, too, were wise. We will remember him as an inspirational lecturer and teacher, an authority on Shakespeare, an expert skier who attended conference lectures appropriately attired with skis to hand, and, robed in red, at the Bordeaux liquid crystal conference in 1978, took great delight in being inaugurated as a Vignoble de St Émilion.&quot;

In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

On 22 May 2007, his death was made public as official messages and tributes poured in.

<text>The Wexner Center for the Arts is the Ohio State University&#x27;s &quot;multidisciplinary, international laboratory for the exploration and advancement of contemporary art.&quot;

The Wexner Center is a lab and public gallery, but not an art museum, as it does not collect art. However, when the center was constructed, it replaced the University Gallery of Fine Arts, and assumed possession and stewardship of the University Gallery&#x27;s permanent collection of roughly 3,000 art works. The collection serves a secondary role in the center&#x27;s programs in the visual, media and performing arts. The Wexner Center is made available to Ohio State University students and scholars for study, and is open to the public. The Wexner Center opened in November 1989, named in honor of the father of Limited Brands founder Leslie Wexner, who was a major donor to the center.

==History==
The precursor was the University Gallery of Fine Art which was curated by the university&#x27;s fine art director. In 1970, under Director Betty Collings&#x27; leadership, the gallery began hosting major contemporary artists and acquiring the collection that would become the Wexner Center as a response to student grievances about the Kent State shootings. In the 1980s, Jonathan Green became director and acquired art that expressed activism. The gallery&#x27;s final exhibit was “AIDS: The Artists’ Response” in 1989 prior to the opening of the Wexner Center.

The $43 million Wexner Center, commissioned by Ohio State University, was named after the father of Leslie H. Wexner, chairman of Limited Brands, an Ohio native and Ohio State alumnus who pledged $25 million to the project. Peter Eisenman won the design competition for the Wexner in 1983 over four other, more experienced finalists: Cesar Pelli; Michael Graves; Kallmann McKinnell &amp; Wood; and Arthur Erickson. (Each was paired with a local architect.) &quot;Progressive Architecture&quot; magazine devoted a whole issue to the building even before it was finished.

The Wexner Center opened on November 17, 1989, and architects like Philip Johnson, Richard Meier and Charles Gwathmey convened in Columbus to mark the building&#x27;s completion with a public forum on the state of American architecture. The event was hailed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most eagerly awaited architectural events of the last decade.&quot;

During its three-year renovation between 2002 and 2005, the Wexner relocated its galleries in a former coffin factory two miles away, while the performing arts and film programs continued at the center. It typically drew 200,000 to 250,000 visitors a year before the renovation. In November 2005, the Wexner Center reopened.

==Architecture==

The Wexner Center&#x27;s , three-story building was designed by architects Peter Eisenman of New York and the late Richard Trott of Columbus with landscape architect Laurie Olin of Philadelphia. It was the first major public building to be designed by Eisenman, previously known primarily as a teacher and theorist. Based on the controversial theory that art should be &quot;challenged&quot; by its environment rather than displayed neutrally, the museum raised Eisenman&#x27;s profile and he went on to design and build a number of other major projects including the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin.

When determining the site, Eisenman and Trott rejected four options from OSU in favor of their own site between Weigel Hall, home of the School of Music, and Mershon Auditorium, a 3,000-seat hall.

The design includes a large, white metal grid meant to suggest scaffolding, to give the building a sense of incompleteness in tune with the architect&#x27;s deconstructivist tastes. Eisenman also took note of the mismatched street grids of the OSU campus and the city of Columbus, which vary by 12.25 degrees, and designed the Wexner Center to alternate which grids it followed. The result was a building of sometimes questionable functionality, but admitted architectural interest. The center&#x27;s brick turrets make reference to the Ohio State University Armory and Gymnasium, a castle-like building that occupied the site until 1958.

Included in the Wexner Center space are a film and video theater, a performance space – the Mershon Center stage, which seats 2,500 for dance, music, theater, multimedia productions and lectures –, a film and video post production studio, a bookstore, café, and 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) of galleries. The galleries are placed linearly in the building space to emphasize progression. The Fine Arts Library was located to the lower level of the building. Devoid of natural light, the architects employed an alternating warm and cool fluorescent lighting to mimic daylight and a grey palate that put the focus on the collection.

In 1993, the Wexner Center installed Maya Lin&#x27;s large-scale site-specific installation &quot;Groundswell&quot;. The work reinterprets Eastern and Western landscape forms in shattered tempered glass to fill in three sites of the building&#x27;s design. That year, the building won the American Institute of Architects&#x27; National Honor Award.

The 2005 renovation originally enlisted the help of a local firm, then switched to Arup. In addition to the building envelope, the scope of renovation includes HVAC, lighting, electrical, plumbing, fire protection systems. The renovation works had a minimum impact on the original architectural design while improving environmental, daylight and climate control. With the restoration of the center as a whole, the bookstore, film and video theater, and café sections were all revamped, equipment and layout-wise.

==Programs==

===Exhibitions===
Notable exhibitions include: Chris Marker: &quot;Silent Movie&quot;, Julie Taymor: &quot;Playing With Fire&quot;, Shirin Neshat: &quot;Suite Fantastique, As Painting: Division and Displacement, Mood River&quot;, Pier Paolo Calzolari, &quot;Part Object Part Sculpture, Twice Untitled and Other Pictures (looking back)&quot;, Louise Lawler, Chris Marker &quot;Staring Back&quot;, William Wegman: &quot;Funney/Strange&quot;, Andy Warhol: &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;, and William Forsythe: &quot;Transfigurations&quot;.

In 2002, the Wexner staged &quot;Mood River&quot;, one of the most comprehensive exhibitions of industrial and commercial design staged in America, featuring artwork by Simparch, Tony Cragg, and E.V. Day; designs by Peter Eisenman, Kivi Sotamaa, and Ben van Berkel; and &quot;products&quot; like the Stealth Bomber and the Redman Self-Defense Instructor suits. In 2017, the gallery featured an exhibition by Cindy Sherman. In 2018, the Wexner showcased the works of 16 artists working in contemporary abstraction, including Eric N. Mack, Sam Gilliam and Zachary Armstrong.
In 2019, the Wexner Center kicked off its 30th anniversary year of exhibitions with &quot;HERE: Ann Hamilton, Jenny Holzer, Maya Lin.&quot;

The Box, the Wexner Center&#x27;s dedicated to video and short film work opened in September 2005 and typically offers a new piece every month.

In 2022, admission to the Wexner Center for the Arts&#x27;s galleries became free for all audiences.

===Film/Video Theater===
The Wexner Center&#x27;s Film/Video department is known for screening films that are new and different, rare and classic, or just too edgy for the multiplex. They have a year-round theater program that includes independent films, international cinema, new documentaries, classics, and experimental film. Films are often accompanied by visiting filmmakers discussing their works for the public.

The Film/Video department presents more than 180 films and videos annually in all formats and genres in the center&#x27;s Film/Video Theater that seats about 300; hosts visiting filmmakers year-round; operates the Film/Video Studio Program (known as the Art &amp; Technology program until 2010), which is an in-kind residency program that offers production and post-production support to filmmakers and video artists; programs The Box, the center&#x27;s dedicated video exhibition space; and organizes gallery-based exhibitions involving moving image media. The department was given the &quot;Outstanding Organization&quot; Award from NAMAC, the National Alliance for Media Arts and Culture, in 2002.

===Performing arts===

Jones, Anne Bogart and the SITI Company, Big Art Group, Ann Hamilton (in collaboration with Meg Stuart and subsequently with Meredith Monk), Improbable Theatre, Bebe Miller, The Builders Association, Akram Khan, Elizabeth Streb, Eiko &amp; Koma, The Wooster Group, Savion Glover, Urban Bush Women, Anthony Davis, Richard Maxwell, da da kamera, Mark Morris, Young Jean Lee&#x27;s Theater Company, and Kronos Quartet.

==Artist awards==
===The Wexner Prize===
Established in 1992, the Wexner Prize recognizes an artist whose work reflects exceptional innovation and the highest standards of artistic quality and integrity.

The prize includes a $50,000 award and an engraved commemorative sculpture designed by Jim Dine in 1991. Programs at the Wexner Center explore the prize recipient&#x27;s career and thought.

Past winners include film and theater director Peter Brook (1992), choreographer Merce Cunningham and composer John Cage (1993), artist Bruce Nauman (1994), choreographer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer (1995), filmmaker Martin Scorsese (1996/97), painter Gerhard Richter (1998), sculptor Louise Bourgeois (1999), artist Robert Rauschenberg (2000), architect Renzo Piano (2001), choreographer William Forsythe (2002), designer Issey Miyake (2004), choreographer Bill T. Jones (2005), and filmmaker Spike Lee (2008).

===Artist residencies===
Residencies at the Wexner Center offer support to artists and often provide opportunities for interaction with the Ohio State community and the public at large. They are an essential part of the Wex&#x27;s mandate to be a creative research laboratory for all the arts.

Wexner Center Residency Awards are their most substantial and high-profile residencies. They are given annually in the main program areas—performing arts, media arts (film/video), and visual arts—with some projects extending over two or more years.

Other artists participating in exhibitions and performances also may receive commissions and often engage in residency activities—workshops, master classes, and discussion sessions with students or the community—during their time at the center. In addition, each year about 20 visiting filmmakers and video artists from around the world are invited to work in residence in the Film/Video Studio Program.

<doc id="575773" wikidata="Q2746361" url="?curid=575773" title="Retailers' cooperative">
<text>A retailers&#x27; cooperative is a type of cooperative which employs economies of scale on behalf of its retailer members. Retailers&#x27; cooperatives use their purchasing power to acquire discounts from manufacturers and often share marketing expenses. A retailers&#x27; cooperative is essentially a group of independently owned businesses that pool their resources to purchase in bulk, usually by establishing a central buying organization, and engage in joint promotion efforts. It is common for locally owned grocery stores, hardware stores, and pharmacies to participate in retailers&#x27; cooperatives.

Both consumers&#x27; cooperatives and workers&#x27; cooperatives should be distinguished from a retailers&#x27; cooperative.

==Governance and operation==
Retailers&#x27; cooperatives are governed by democratic member control, which generally means one vote per member. Some firms, such as E. Leclerc, are able to make decisions in this fashion, with each member business only receiving one vote. For many retailer co-ops, however, it is difficult to achieve a democratic standard. Since the members are businesses rather than individuals, offering one vote per member will leave the larger member businesses underrepresented. If the number of votes is based on the size of the business, there is a risk of all smaller businesses within the cooperative being outvoted by a larger business. A democratic solution that many retailers&#x27; cooperatives employ is an increase in votes based on business size, up to a certain point, say 5 or 10 votes. This way, the degree of representation for member businesses varies.

==Financing and economic goals==
In order to lower costs, retailers&#x27; cooperatives establish central buying locations, providing them with the opportunity to purchase in bulk. Retailers&#x27; cooperatives also engage in group advertising and promotion, uniform stock merchandising, and private branding. This increases consumer recognition of brands and is beneficial for the stores under a franchise.

The aim of the cooperative is to improve buying conditions for its members, which are retail businesses in this case. The incentive to remain in the cooperative is largely due to the profits that members gain. Generally, any surpluses are shared by the members in accordance with their original input.

==Examples==

Examples of retailer&#x27;s cooperatives include the following:
*Australia and New Zealand
**Mitre 10 
**Foodstuffs
*Canada
**Federated Co-operatives
**Home Hardware
*United States
**Ace Hardware
**Do It Best
**Frontier Co-Op
**True Value &quot;(until 2018, now privately owned)&quot;
**Best Western &quot;(until 1985, now a franchisor)&quot;
**ShopRite
**National Automotive Parts Association (NAPA)
*France
**E.Leclerc
**Les Mousquetaires
**Système U
*Germany
**Edeka
**REWE Group
*Italy
**Conad
*United Kingdom
**Nisa
**Edinburgh Bicycle Cooperative

<text>Knight&#x27;s Cross (German language &quot;Ritterkreuz&quot;) refers to a distinguishing grade or level of various orders that often denotes bravery and leadership on the battlefield.

Most frequently the term Knight&#x27;s Cross is used to refer to the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, a military decoration of Nazi Germany. However, numerous orders have a Knight&#x27;s Cross grade. Examples include the Cross of Merit on the ribbon of the Bundesverdienstkreuz, the &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, a grade of the War Merit Cross, the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Brandenburg Bailiwick of the Knights&#x27; Order of the Hospital of St John in Jerusalem, the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph, the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, 1st class (Knight) of the Order of the Sun, and the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the House Order of Hohenzollern.

<doc id="575776" wikidata="Q21136" url="?curid=575776" title="Lethal dose">
<text>In toxicology, the lethal dose (LD) is an indication of the lethal toxicity of a given substance or type of radiation. Because resistance varies from one individual to another, the &quot;lethal dose&quot; represents a dose (usually recorded as dose per kilogram of subject body weight) at which a given &quot;percentage&quot; of subjects will die. The lethal concentration is a lethal dose measurement used for gases or particulates. The LD may be based on the standard person concept, a theoretical individual that has perfectly &quot;normal&quot; characteristics, and thus not apply to all sub-populations.

==Median lethal dose (LD50)==

The median lethal dose, LD50 (abbreviation for &quot;lethal dose, 50%&quot;), LC50 (lethal concentration, 50%) or LCt50 (lethal concentration and time) of a toxin, radiation, or pathogen is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD50 figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance&#x27;s acute toxicity. A lower LD50 is indicative of increased toxicity.

=== History ===
The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927. The term &quot;semilethal dose&quot; is occasionally used with the same meaning, in particular in translations from non-English-language texts, but can also refer to a &quot;sub&quot;lethal dose; because of this ambiguity, it is usually avoided. LD50 is usually determined by tests on animals such as laboratory mice. In 2011 the US Food and Drug Administration approved alternative methods to LD50 for testing the cosmetic drug Botox without animal tests.

=== Units and measurement ===
The LD50 is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as milligrams of substance per kilogram of body mass, but stated as nanograms (suitable for botulinum), micrograms, milligrams, or grams (suitable for paracetamol) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed, although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass.

The choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD50 is &quot;not&quot; the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD50. Measures such as &quot;LD1&quot; and &quot;LD99&quot; (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.

Lethal dosage often varies depending on the method of administration; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when intravenously administered. For this reason, LD50 figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., &quot;LD50 i.v.&quot;

The related quantities LD50/30 or LD50/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly with radiation, as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.

==== Estimation using model organisms ====
LD values for humans are best estimated by extrapolating results from human cell cultures. One form of measuring LD is to use model organisms, particularly animals like mice or rats, converting to dosage per kilogram of biomass, and extrapolating to human norms. The degree of error from animal-extrapolated LD values is large. The biology of test animals differs in important aspects to that of humans. For instance, mouse tissue is approximately fifty times less responsive than human tissue to the venom of the Sydney funnel-web spider. The square–cube law also complicates the scaling relationships involved. Researchers are shifting away from animal-based LD measurements in some instances. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve more non-animal methods in response to animal welfare concerns.

=== Median infective dose ===
The median infective dose (ID50) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD50&#x27;s to some test animal. In biological warfare infective dosage is the number of infective doses per minute for a cubic meter (e.g., ICt50 is 100 medium doses - min/m3).)

==Lowest lethal dose==
The lowest lethal dose (LDLo) is the least amount of drug that can produce death in a given animal species under controlled conditions. The dosage is given per unit of bodyweight (typically stated in milligrams per kilogram) of a substance known to have resulted in fatality in a particular species. When quoting an LDLo, the particular species and method of administration (&quot;e.g.&quot; ingested, inhaled, intravenous) are typically stated.

==Median lethal concentration==
For gases and aerosols, lethal concentration (given in mg/m3 or ppm, parts per million) is the analogous concept, although this also depends on the duration of exposure, which has to be included in the definition. The term incipient lethal level is used to describe a LC50 value that is independent of time.

A comparable measurement is LCt50, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m3. LCt50 is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of chemical warfare agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10 L/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration. The concept of Ct was first proposed by Fritz Haber and is sometimes referred to as Haber&#x27;s law, which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100 mg/m3 is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10 mg/m3 (1 × 100 = 100, as does 10 × 10 = 100).

Some chemicals, such as hydrogen cyanide, are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber&#x27;s Law. So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC50 and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The material safety data sheets for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber&#x27;s Law.

==Lowest lethal concentration==
The LCLo is the lowest concentration of a chemical, given over a period of time, that results in the fatality of an individual animal. LCLo is typically for an acute (&lt;24 hour) exposure. It is related to the LC50, the median lethal concentration. The LCLo is used for gases and aerosolized material.

== Limitations ==
As a measure of toxicity, lethal dose is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.

There can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (&quot;cf.&quot; paracetamol toxicity), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be toxic to many animals. When used to test venom from venomous creatures, such as snakes, LD50 results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many venomous snakes are specialized predators of mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and mongooses may be exceptionally resistant. While most mammals have a very similar physiology, LD50 results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, including humans.

== Animal rights concerns ==
Animal-rights and animal-welfare groups, such as Animal Rights International, have campaigned against LD50 testing on animals in particular as, in the case of some substances, causing the animals to die slow, painful deaths. Several countries, including the UK, have taken steps to ban the oral LD50, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) abolished the requirement for the oral test in 2001.

<text>Tuffi (born 1946, India – died in 1989, Paris, France) was a female Asian elephant that became famous in West Germany during 1950 when she accidentally fell from the Wuppertal Schwebebahn into the River Wupper underneath.

On 21 July 1950, the circus director Franz Althoff (de) had Tuffi, then four years old, travel on the suspended monorail in Wuppertal, as a publicity stunt. The elephant trumpeted wildly and ran through the carriage, broke through a window and fell into the River Wupper, suffering only minor injuries. A panic broke out in the carriage and some passengers were injured. Althoff helped the elephant out of the water. Both the circus director and the official who had allowed the ride were fined. Tuffi was sold to Cirque Alexis Gruss (fr) in 1968; she died there in 1989.

No photograph of the incident is known; a widely circulated postcard picture is a montage. A building near the location of the incident, between the stations and , features a painting of Tuffi. A local milk-factory has chosen the name as a brand.

The Wuppertal tourist information keeps an assortment of Tuffi-related souvenirs, local websites show original pictures.

In 1970 Marguerita Eckel and Ernst-Andreas Ziegler published a children&#x27;s picture book about the incident titled (“Tuffi and the suspension railway”).
